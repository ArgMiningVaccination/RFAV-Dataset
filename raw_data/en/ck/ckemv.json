Green School of International and Public AffairsCollege of BusinessCollege of Engineering and Computing Page 7 of 205 This page intentionally left blank Iqbal Akhta r Department of Religious Studies Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs Dr. Iqbal Akhtar completed his doctorate at the University of Edinburgh's New School of Divinity in 2012, after which he began working at FIU in the Department of Religious Studies . He holds a joint appointment in Politics and International Relations. His doctoral thesis was an interdisciplinary history of the Khj community in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam in contemporary Tanzania. His work exam ined how migration changed the community's identity as embedded in linguistic heritage. Dr. Akhtar's monograph, The Khj of Tanzania, is a microhistory, one of many other stories of Islam in the 20th century. It depicts and analyzes a modern globalized Muslim community struggling with its ethnic past in an ideological present. Dr. Akhtar founded the Western Indian Ocean Studies (WIOS) program that links FIU with scholars in Africa and Asia working on vernacular Islamic histories. Through WIOS, he has estab lished memoranda of understanding with community organizations and universities in the U.K., France, China, Pakistan, and Tanzania. This has led to the development of a subfield within Islamic Studies \u2014Khj Studies, whose aim is to promote the study of ver nacular Islam. American Islamic Studies continues to privilege Arabic, Persian, and Turkish as the core languages of the Islamic world, despite the fact that the majority of Muslims today do not speak these languages. WIOS has provided research affiliation s for researchers around the globe for interdisciplinary scholarly collaboration and support in international grant applications. Teaching students at FIU is an extension of this international approach in which various global perspectives inform the study of religion and politics. Dr. Akhtar's main international relations course (INR 4013) is the first survey at FIU of indigenous IR traditions from China and India to sub-Saharan Africa and pre -Colombian Americas. His Religious Studies courses incorporate th e perspective of marginalized Muslim groups, such as the Ismaili and Ahmadiyya, through lectures and site visits.

Fluorinated glucosamine analogs useful for modulating post -translational glycosylations on cells United States Patent Application : 20060281708 . Appl. No.: 11/508566. The present invention provides compositions and methods for inhibiting cell migration, e.g., lymphocytes and inflammation. The invention also provides an improved process for preparin g fluorinated N -acetylglucosamines . We developed a method with non -toxic metabolic inhibitors of N -aceylglucosaminyltransferase activity, such as peracetylated 4 -fluoro -glucosamine (4 -F-GlcNAc), that, upon cell entry and conversion to a nucleotide sugar d onor (UDP -4-F-GlcNAc), shorten sugar chains on cell surface glycoproteins. This activity is selective to highly glycosylating cells, such as cancer cells and activated T cells. 2.) Galectin -Immunoglobulin Chimeric Molecules (BWH 20105 ; 2010 PCT/US10/39504 . Described are Galectin -1/Ig fusion constructs and methods of use thereof, e.g., in diagnostic and biomedical assays, and as therapeutic agents for the treatment of conditions associated with i mmune dysfunction, e.g., autoimmune diseases, and cancers. We developed a p rototype galectin -1 chimeric protein and a variety of of immune suppressive cytokines, notably IL-10. Specifically, w hen bound to activated T cells, this protein triggers the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines, TGF TNF - and IL-17 produc tion. This formulation does not require exogenous chemicals to stabilize homodimer formation and functional activity. This activity is a desired effect for dampening autoimmune diseases and cutaneous inflammatory disorders. This reagent can be used for a variety of laboratory methods, including Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Importantly, we developed an Fc variant that could be used in humans as a potential anti -inflammatory agent to treat autoimmune diseases. 3.) Anti -Galec tin-1 Humanized Blocking Antibodies (BWH 21947; Intellectual Property Disclosure, 2012) Galectin -1 (Gal -1) promotes progression of various cancer types, including melanoma, colon, breast, prostate, ovarian, glioma, lung, squamous cell carcinoma and cutane ous T cell lymphoma. Gal -1 is a hypoxia - inducible protein that binds N -acetyllactosamine glycoproteins to promote tumor immune evasion, migration, metalloprotease expression and angiogenesis. Accordingly, blockade of Gal -1 activity by means of specific Page 81 of 205 18 inhibitors such as antibodies, selective small molecules, RNA interfering molecules or metabolic sugars not only dampens cancer progression but also restores sensitivity in primary and metastatic tumors to chemo - and radiotherapy. Unfortunately, while there has been one reported development of a murine anti -Gal-1 blocking Ab, we have found no such reports of a humanized anti -Gal-1 blocking antibody available for use in research or in human patients. Moreover, inhibitory sugars such as lactose, a lactose analo g thiodigalactoside (TDG), or 4 -F-GlcNAc, are non-specific blockers of Gal -1 since they also inhibit binding activity of other members of the galectin family and/or require prohibitively high concentrations for therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we propos e the development of, to our knowledge, the first ever humanized anti -Gal-1 blocking antibody. 4.) Using Galectin -Binding Carbohydrates - human Fc chimeric molecule (Gal -1hFc) to detect novel Gal -1 ligand(s) on human malignant melanoma cells, including lymph node -metastatic cells, that are conspicuously absent on normal me lanocytes and on e pidermal mildly dysplastic melanocytes. This malignant (i.e. ligands) and non -malignant melanocytes do not. Currently, there are no immunohistochemical methods routinely used to detect and discr iminate benign from malignant melanoma or to predict whether a melanoma will metastasize. We believe that Gal -1hFc can be used in this regard. The invention is as follows: 1.) human malignant melanoma cells express Gal -1 ligands and normal or dysplastic melanocytes do not; and 2.) Gal -1hFc can be used as a histological probe to help diagnose melanoma and/or to help predict metastatic potential. Detecting Gal -1 ligands in human melanomas could be vitally important for determining malignancy and clinical o utcome or for guiding oncologists' decision to initiate a suitable treatment plan. 5.) Identification of glycomic biomarkers of melanoma progression ( BWH 23481 ; Disclosure, 2015 ) To discover biomarkers of melanoma development and progression, we embarked on studies comparing the glycomic features of normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) and metastatic melanoma (MM) cells. Glycomic features embody all of those enzymatic, membran ous and regulatory proteins that impinge on glycan formation/degradation to create a cell's signature glycosylation phenotype. We conducted both comparative transcriptional profiling of glycomic genes and mass spectrometry of cell surface glycans on NHEM and MM cells and found that the defining fe ature of NHEMs was the presence of \"I\" -branched glycans, whereas MM cells displayed predominantly \"i\" This branched (NHEM) vs. linear (MM) glycan phenotype was due to the expression and activity (or lack thereof) of \"I\" -branching cells generated \"I\" -branched glycans and a concomitant delay in in vivo growth activity. We believe that \"I\" -branches and the regulatory role of GCNT2 in NHEM cells function as tumor suppressors, while the presence of \"i\" linear glycans marks the transition to melanoma malignancy and/or metastasis. 6.) Novel glycomic regulators of B cell differentiation (BWH 24139 ; Intellectual Property Disclosure, 2016) Robust antibody (Ab) -mediated immune responses are dependent on effective differentiation of na\u00efve B cells to Ab -producing effector B cells within specialized immunologic niches called germinal centers (GC). Whether and how glycans, glycan -forming enzymes and glycan -binding lec tins influence the efficiency of B cell maturation in GCs is still relatively poorly understood. Our laboratory has embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the glycomic nature of primary human B cell subsets isolated from human tonsil, including na\u00efve (antigen -inexperienced), GC -affinity chromatography, with lectins, and N -glycomic mass spectrometry methods, we generated data indicating that GC B cells were characterized by high levels of surface poly -N-acetyllactosamines Page 82 of 205 19 (PLs) containing I -antigens. As PLs are notorious binding partners for immunoregulatory galectins (Gal) -1, 3 and 9, we examined whether they exhibited co ncomitant high binding activity to GC B cells. Surprisingly, with the exception of Gal -1, binding of Gal -3 and -9 was significantly lower on GC B cells compared with high binding to na\u00efve and memory B cells. Functional analysis on the nature of this bindi ng dichotomy revealed that I -antigen enzyme GCNT2 was a critical negative regulator of Gal -3 and -9-binding. Moreover, discovery of candidate membrane receptors for physiologic Gal -3/Gal -9-binding on na\u00efve (I -antigen negative) B cells showed that CD45 was the major receptor. Notably, Gal -9 binding to CD45 on primary B cells caused a downstream cell signaling cascade reminiscent of antigen - dependent B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. To what extent modulation of Gal -9 - B cell CD45 binding encourages effect ive B cell maturation and development of high -affinity Ab -producing cells is under intense investigation. Collectively, our breakthrough data imply that this novel glycomic mechanism could have profound effects on the efficiency of B cell differentiation, which is fundamentally related to the development of long -lived immunity and effective vaccinations or, if deregulated, to autoimmunity and B -lymphomagenesis. 7.) Novel regulator of galectin -binding and immune boosting activity (BWH 25471 ; Intellectual Property Disclosure, 2019) Adaptive immunity is dependent on effective activation and differentiation of na\u00efve T - and B - lymphocytes (T/B cells) to elicit cell -mediated and humoral immune responses. What is becoming increasingly clear in our understanding o f the molecular regulators of adaptive immunity is that endogenous \u00df -galactoside -binding galectins (Gal), namely Gal -1,-3 and -9, are ubiquitously expressed and designed to tune and dampen T/B cell functional activity. As such, Gal -1, -3 and -9 negative regulatory effects are important for helping avert chronic inflammatory disorders and autoimmunity, though, in part, account for ineffective T/B cell function associated with anti -tumor immunity and variable responses to cancer immunotherapy. Gal -1, -3 and -9 convey their functions by binding surface glycan ligands on T/B cells, which compromises their ability to activate, proliferate, differentiate and/or elicit effector function. Our laboratory has recently identified an enzyme in human lymphocytes and human cancer cells called I -branching \u00df1,6 N 2 GCNT2 that synthesizes I-branches on poly -N-acetyllactosaminyl glycans and blocks binding of Gal -3 and Gal -9. We have obtained functional data showing that blunting Gal -9 glycan l igand synthesis on human B cell surfaces by induction of GCNT2/I -branching inhibits downstream Gal -9 suppressive effects on cell activation and proliferation. To this end, our working hypothesis is that induction of GCNT2/I -branching can help evade the ne gative regulatory effects of Gal -3 and Gal -9 ligand binding on T/B cell function. Practice of our Induction of GCNT2/I -branching invention has been established using GCNT2 gene expression/silencing lentiviral transduction systems, but we propose that addi tional methods, such as chemical or native (i.e. cytokine) inducers of GCNT2 expression or extrinsic enzymatic synthesis of I - branches on the surface of cells, can be effective in circumventing Gal -3 or Gal -9-mediated immunosuppression. Regarding its prom ise for therapeutic use, adoptive T cell anti -cancer therapeutics, including CAR T cell therapy, as an example, relies on the ex vivo activation and expansion of tumor - specific T cells, which coincidentally upregulate Gal -9 and Gal -9 glycan ligands and bec ome sensitive Gal-9 immunoregulation. Implementation of our Induction of GCNT2/I -branching invention during ex vivo T cell expansion would allow for generation/delivery of T cell infusions resistant to Gal -3- and Gal - 9-binding and suppressive activitie s, thereby improving in vivo longevity and efficacy of the anti -tumor T cells. This advance is critical because it would allow for lower, more effective T cell doses and help offset therapy -limiting immune/CNS -related toxicities caused by current high cel l dose protocols. Not only does our Induction of GCNT2/I -branching invention show promise in terms of enhancing effector anti-tumor T cell functions, but, also as a therapeutic approach to reverse Gal -9-dependent suppression of B cell activation and proli feration during development of long -lived humoral immunity and effective vaccinations.

Narrative R eport I am a global leader in the study of sugars, known as glycobiology, and highly motivated to translate his glycobiological findings to help cure diseases and improve the overall health of humans. My research focuses on understanding how sugars or 'glycans' regulate immune and cancer cell functions with the goal of developing new approaches to boost the immune system to fight diseases and to treat cancer progression. I have been studying the identify, nature and impact of glycans on inflammation and cancer for the last 26 years and operate one of the most reputable translational glycobiology programs in the US. I received my Ph.D. in Molecular Pharmacology at Roswel l Park Cancer Institute, where I studied mechanisms of glycan -dependent adhesion of cancer c ells and corresponding glycan -centric therapeutic Page 90 of 205 27 strategies to thwart metastasis develop ment. I then trained as a Research Fellow in the Department of Dermatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital under the direction of D r. Robert Sackstein, in which I investigated the glycobiology of hematopoietic stem cell homing to bone. Transitioning to independence in 2003, I published groundbreaking data on the function of a class of glyco -enzymes called fucosyltransferases and their glycan products (more commonly fo und on skin -homing immune cells) in prostate cancer cells and their predilection to metastasize to bone. Together, these early efforts resulted in a collection of published articles in high impact journals, J. Clin. Invest ., P.N.A.S., Can. Res., BLOOD , J. Immuno l. and J.B.C. that helped launch my reputation in the glycosciences In 2019, I am now considered an expert on studies of glycan -binding selectins and galectins and their fundamental immunology, inflammato ry proc esses and cancer progression. My laboratory has recently made pioneering observations in two diverse research areas studying the roles of galectin -1, -3 and -9 and their glycoprotein ligands in adaptive immunity and in melanoma progression. Both e fforts have recently been published in the high impact journal, Nature Communications. Galectin -binding glycans deliberately displayed on membrane proteins have a profound effect on the capacity of T and B cells to proliferate, differentiate and function in adaptive immune responses and on the ability of malignant primary melanomas in the skin to metastasize. To this end, my group discovered that \u00df1,6 glucosaminyltransferase 2, GCNT2, which catalyzes the synthesis of I-antigen (or I -branched glycans), fun ctions a critical negative regulator of Gal -3- and Gal -9-binding activity, which profoundly influences B cell immunity and melanoma progression. These findings have wide implications in developing potent immunomodulators of steady -state and pathologic imm unity and new methods to treat, and even predict, melanoma progression. My current translational glycobiology research program is subdivided into (2) components: Cancer Research Program: I am currently exploring the glycobiol ogy of melanoma progression. I have obtained exciting preliminary data that the glycan signature of melanoma cells is vastly different from their normal melanocyte counterparts. The glycans of melanocyte/ melanoma cells are being investigated functionally to help ascertain whether t hese glycan features help drive melanoma metastasis and whether these features can be used as biomarkers to predict melanoma metastasis. Immune Research Program: Other studies in my laboratory are designed to define the glycan signatures and their functi on on human B cells during maturation of a humoral immune response. Using lessons from studies on cancer cell glycobiology, these studies employ a battery of glycobiological tools to interrogate B cell glycan IDs and candidate galectin -binding partners. Recent observations suggest that unique B cell glycans encourages a galectin -binding activity, which could critically impact the efficiency of a humoral immune response, vaccination effectiveness or, even when dysregulated, B - lymphogenesis. These research activities have afforded me the honor of receiving independent NIH R -type grant awards dating back to 2003. Notably, I have recently been awarded 1.) an NIH/NCI Alliance of Glycobiologists for Cancer Research: Biological Tumor Glycomics Laboratories (U01 ) grant (One of 5 cancer glycobiology laboratories in the US) supporting exciting studies on impact of melanoma glycans and disease progression; 2.) an NIH/NIAID R21 grant on studies of novel glycan features impacting B cell function; and 3.) a prestigious Mizutani Glycoscience research grant for his work on glycan -binding galectins and human B cell function. I regularly speak at national and international venues, including symposia at Society for Investigative Dermatology , American Association of Immunolo gists, Society for Glycobiology and American Association for Cancer Research Annual meetings related to glycan - mediated mechanisms of inflammation and metastasis. My administrative duties and laboratory are based within the Department of Dermatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH)/Harvard Medical School (HMS) and the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I am focused on training the next generation of immunologist s/cancer research scientists. I serve as: 1.) Faculty Member, Ha rvard Immunology Ph.D. Program; BWH Dermatology Scholarship Oversight 3.) Director, BWH Page 91 of 205 28 Dermatology Research Training Program; and 4.) Associate Director for Laboratory Research, BWH Dermatology. My emphasis on teaching and mentoring is exemplified by my teaching of laboratory methods on the topics of immunology, biochemistry, cutaneous immunology, glycobiology and tumor metastasis studies. I have supervised 44 trainees since 2003 that range from HS students, PhD graduate students, po st- doctoral fellows to junior faculty. My training methods vary from daily shoulder -to-shoulder instruction in the laboratory to didactic sessions in the form of journal clubs, weekly laboratory meetings and daily discussions on biomedical research. As a faculty member in the HMS Immunolo gy Program, I mentor Ph.D. students on the fundamentals of glycan -mediated mechanisms of adaptive immune cell trafficking and fate/function. Since 2006, I have served a s a Discussion Leader for the ethics, Conduct of Sci ence, course offered through HMS, Division of Medical Sciences that is required by all Ph.D. students. I have established summer internship programs with local high schools, such as the Catalyst Summer Internship Program at The Governor's Academy and summ er research internships at Iroquois High School in Western New York. I have been honored as a nominee 19 -times for HMS faculty recognitions in mentoring and community service and is the recipient of an HMS Junior Faculty Mentor Award and BWH Center for Fa culty Development & Diversity Community Service Award. In my Department as the Associate Director of Laboratory Research, I am co-founder and acting Director of the BWH Department of Dermatology Training Program as well as co -founder and acting Chair of Scholarship Oversight Committee. I lead the BWH Dermatology Research Operations Team and am the leader of weekly BWH Dermatolog y Research Seminars and Invited Speaker Series. In summary, my current administrative, research and mentoring roles encourage a multi -faceted approach to biomedical academic research at BWH/HMS and a state -of-the-art, evolving laboratory that spawns succes sful scientists at every academic level. This has resulted in a strong National/International reputation and continued NIH R -award funding. My hope is to translate my basic glycobiology research findings to new treatment strategies to build a more effect ive immune system for fighting disease and to halt the spread of cancer.

Bejar Page 127 of 205 This page intentionally left blank May 8, 2019 Executive Summary of Substantive Proposed Student Code of Conduct Revisions Section 6. Student Academic Honor Code: Prohibited Conduct The addition of section 6 creates a section on academic misconduct outlining prohibited conduct by an undergraduate or graduate, including professional, student. This is to ensure every Charged Student is provided sufficient due process and all academic misconduct across campus is handled uniformly. Although graduate and professional students will be processed under the revised Student Code of Conduct for prohibited conduct, Colleges will maintain the ability to sanction Responsible students for unprofessionalism if applicable under licensure standards. Section 7. Pre-hearing Procedures Academic Honor Code Charges are initiated by any member of the University community using the Academic Misconduct Report Form. Instructors are encouraged to discuss the alleged violation with the student first. Once the allegation is referred to the Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution Director, the instructor may request a meeting to present additional information and documentation or an explanation of the impending Conduct process. While conduct charges are impending, a student's academic status remains unchanged unless a determination is made that the student presents a threat to the health, safety, or welfare to the University community. If a final grade is at issue, then a grade of IN will be assigned until the resolution of the matter. Section 8 Resolution Options The final written decision will also be sent to the instructor. Hearings for academic misconduct will consist of three (3) students, and two (2) faculty members. Section 9 Hearing Notification Instructors will be invited to attend the hearing involving academic misconduct. Section 13 Hearing Procedures Instructors are permitted to present evidence and testimony during the hearing and the student is allowed to question the Instructor.

Page 130 of 205 1 FIU-2501 Student Conduct and Honor Code of Conduct As an academic community, Florida International University (FIU) fosters the intellectual exchange of ideas, knowledge, and experience. It is the responsibility of the University to provide a safe and stimulating environment in which scholarship and personal growth may occur. The desired effect is that Students will ta ke advantage of this environment to develop intellectually as well as to participate as responsible, contributing citizens of our community. Being a contributing Student also comes with responsibility to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct and Honor Code (Code) . The ultimate responsibility for knowing University requirements and regulations rests with the Student , regardless of institutional or program affiliation. Nothing in this Regulation should be interpreted to abridge the right of any member of the University community of rights granted under the United States or Florida Constitution and/or any other applicable law including, but not limited to, the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment. Those charged with and found R responsible for violations of the Student Code of Conduct will be subject to appropriate action as outlined herein. For the most current Student Code of Conduct , please refer to the website of the Office of Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution (SCCR) at conduct.fiu.edu. Undergraduate , and Graduate, and Professional Students at FIU are expected to adhere to the highest standards of integrity in every aspect of their lives. Honesty in academic matters is part of this obligation. Academic integrity is the adherence to those special values regarding life and work in an academic commun ity. Code violations may lead to suspension or expulsion from the University if a determination of responsibility has been made. These sanctions will be determined based on severity of incident , prior incidents of Academic Misconduct, and prior violations of the Code . The safety and well -being of our community is the University's foremost concern. Florida International University FIU has zero tolerance for acts that compromise the safety and well - being of members of the University community. It is the pol icy of the University that acts of harassment and violence will not be tolerated. Any act of intimidation, threat of violence, or act of violence committed against other members of the University when committed within the jurisdiction of the Student Code of Conduct is prohibited. Any Student or Student Organization found responsible for a violation of this standard will be subject to discipline up to and including expulsion pursuant to the Student Code of Conduct . Student Code of Conduct violations in the following list, may lead to suspension or dismissal expulsion from the University if a determination of responsibility has been made: Drug distribution and/or sales (Section 5(g)(2)) Endangerment (Section 5(h)) Hazing (Section 5(m) Sexual misconduct (Section 5(s)) Stalking (Section 5(u)) Weapons (Section 5(z)) Page 131 of 205 2 This revised Code is effective the first day of classes for 20198 Summer B (i.e., June 178, 20198). 1. 1. DEFINITIONS a. Academic Misconduct: Any act or omission by a Student, which violates the concept of academic integrity and undermines the academic mission of the University in violation of the Code. a.b. Advisor : Any person chosen by the Charged Student, Charged Student Organization, or the Complainant to assist throughout the Student Conduct and/or Academic Misconduct process es (e.g., faculty, staff, parent/guardian, attorney, friend, alumni, or any other person who is not a Witness in the process ). b.c. Business Day : A day when the University is open for regular business operations from 8:00 am up to 5:00 pm Eastern Time. For emailed correspondence, the day of delivery is not included in a designated time period. c.d. Character Witness Statement : A statement relating to the general character and reputati on of the person. d.e. Charge : The written statement of the alleged violations of the Student Conduct of Code. e.f. Charged Student : Any Student who has been charged with an alleged violation of the Student Code of Conduct . f.g. Coercion : Conduct, intimidation, and/or express ed or implied threats of physical, emotional, financial, or any other type of harm that would reasonably place an individual in fear of immediate or future harm and that is employed to force or compel someone to engage in sexual contact or any other type of involuntary conduct, especially conduct which would endanger or be detrimental to the Complainant. Examples of Coercion include: Causing the deliberate Incapacitation (see below for definition) of another person; Conditioning an academic benefit or employment advantage; Threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in sexual contact; or Threatening to disclose an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or other personal or sensitive information if the other party does not engage in the sexual contact or takes actions involuntarily. g.h.Complainant : Any individual who may have been the subject of any Sexual Misconduct, Dating or Domestic Partner Violence, and/or S stalking by the Charged Student regardless of whether the individual makes a report. h.i. Consent : A clear, knowing, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity at the time of the activity. Consent can be communicated by words or actions as long as those words or actions create mutually understandable permission regarding willingness to engage in (and the conditions of) sexual activity. Consent must be ongoing throughout the sexual activity and can be withdrawn at any time. Sexual contact must cease immediatel y once withdrawal of consent is clearly communicated. Consent must be active, not passive. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent has been granted, nor does silence mean consent has been granted. Page 132 of 205 3 Within each sexual encounter, there may be separate individual sexual acts involved, and consent to one act and/or person(s) by itself does not constitute consent to another act and/or person(s). The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations, should never, by itself, be assumed to be an indicator of consent for any current or future sexual encounter even in the context of a relationship, there must be mutual consent. If coercion or force is used, there is no consent. If a person is incapacitated so that the person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent. This may be affected by conditions due to age, alcohol or drug consumption, unconsciousness, be ing asleep, physical or developmental disabilities. Whether one has taken advantage of a position of influence over another can be a factor in determining whether there was consent. In order to give consent, one must be of legal age. The question of what the Charged Student should have known as to whether the Complainant was Incapacitated is objectively based on what a reasonable person, sober and/or exercising good judgment, would have known about the condition of the Complainant. i.j. Dating or Domestic Partn er Violence: Any instance of violence or abuse (verbal, physical, or psychological) that occurs between those who are in, or have been in, an intimate relationship with each other. k.

Although hazing is typically related to a person's initiation or admission into, or affiliation with a Student Organization, athletic team (intramural, club or intercollegiate), extracurricular activity or any other University group or organization, it is not necessary to have direct proof that a person's initiation or continued membership is contingent upon participation in the activity for a charge of hazing to be upheld. The actions of active, prospective, former, or associate members (pledges) of a Student Organization may be considered hazing. Organizational leaders who plan a hazing event will be held Responsible even if not in attendance at an event where the hazing occurs. j.m. Hearing Body: Student Conduct hearings Cconsist s of a Hearing Officer or, if a Student Conduct Committee, two (2) S students, a faculty/staff member, and a non- voting Hearing Officer.

TITLE IX PROCEDURES Page 157 of 205 28 The University's Title IX Coordinator has designated the SCCR Director to serve as Deputy Title IX Coordinator. It is the responsibility of the Title IX Coordinator and Deputy Title IX Coordinator to ensure that the process relating to alleged Title IX/ Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) violations is reliable, impartial, thorough, prompt and conducted in an equitable manner. The general Student Code of Conduct procedures are tailored for the investigation and resolution of reported violations of the University prohibitions against Sexual Misconduct, D ating or Domestic P artner Violence, S talking and/or Retaliation. These tailored procedures require equitable access for both a C omplainant and Charged Student as well as notice requirements and other considerations. a. Prohibited Conduct : Title IX cases include prohibited conduct listed in Section 5. e (Dating or Domestic Partner Violence), 5.r (Retaliation), 5.s (Sexual Misconduct), and 5.u (Stalking). b. Pre-Hearing Procedures 1. Investigations : If the SCCR Director determines that an investigation is necessary into the alleged violations, the procedures below will be followed. All fact finding will occur during the investigat ion stage prior to the hearing. There will be no additional documents or testimony presented at the hearing. i. The SCCR Director will select a trained investigator(s) to gather sufficient evidence to reach a fair, impartial determination as to whether there is enough information to move forward with charging a student with a violation of the Student Code of Conduct based on the preponderance of the evidence. The investigator(s) will be trained to gather and document the available evidence to support reliable decisions, synthesize all available evidence (including both supportive and non- supportive evidence) and take into account the unique and complex circumstances of each case. ii. The SCCR Director will select investigator(s) who are free of actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest and biases for or against any party. The Charged Student or Complainant may raise any concerns about bias or conflict of interests within three (3) business days to the SCCR Director. 2. The Notice of Investigation : Prior to the initial investigation meeting, the SCCR Director will send to the Charged Student and Complainant written notice about the allegations constituting a potential violation of the Student Code of Conduct in order for the parties to prepare for meaningful participation in the investigation. 3. Investigative Procedures : During an investigation, the investigator(s) will seek to meet separately with the Complainant, the Charged Student, and any Witnesses. Witnesses are individuals who may have informa tion relevant to the incident, including individuals who may have observed the acts in question, may be able to provide contextual information or may have other information related to the incident, the disclosure , or related matters. Character witness stat ements will not be considered by the investigator(s). The investigator(s) will also gather other relevant information or evidence, including documents, photographs, communications between the parties, medical records (subject to the consent of the applicable person) and other electronic records as appropriate. The investigator(s), not the parties, are responsible for gathering relevant evidence to the extent reasonably possible. Both the Complainant and Charged Student are encouraged to promptly submit any relevant information, Page 158 of 205 29 including Witnesses' names. If a party declines to provide relevant information, the University's ability to conduct a prompt, thorough and equitable investigation may be impaired. 4. Prior Sexual History :. The sexual history of the Complainant and/or the Charged Student will never be used to prove character or reputation. Evidence related to the prior sexual history of the parties is generally not used in determining whether a violation of this Code has occurred and will only be consider ed under limited circumstances. For example, prior sexual history may be relevant to explain injury, to provide proof of a pattern or to address another specific issue raised in the investigation. The investigator(s) will determine the relevance of this in formation, and both parties will be informed if evidence of prior or subsequent conduct is deemed relevant. 5. Written Investigation Report: Upon conclusion of the investigation, the investigator(s) will prepare a written report summarizing the relevant infor mation which will include any evidence and/or a list of Witnesses that are supportive or not supportive of a violation. The Charged Student, the Complainant and/or any Witnesses will have the opportunity to review the report before it becomes final. Upon notice of the availability of the investigation report, the Charged Student and the Complainant will have five (5) Business Days to: i. Meet again with the investigator, ii. Provide written comment or feedback on the facts as gathered, iii. Submit additional informatio n, and/or iv. Identify additional Witnesses and/or request the collection of other information by the investigator. v. If any party provides a written response or makes a request for additional information, the content will be shared as appropriate and incorpora ted in the final investigation report. Participation in this iterative process is important given that the investigation report will be the only evidence submitted at the Hearing. Once the investigation report is final, a redacted copy will be provided to the Charged Student and Complainant at the same time. This report will be used in the hearing. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, information not provided by any party during the investigation or not included in the report will not be permitted to be introduced at the hearing. 6. Charge Letter: At the time of the issuing the charge letter to the Charged Student, the Complainant will also be notified of the charges and be offered an Information Session. c. Due Process Rights of The Complainant : 1. Reasonable, written notice of the Student Code of Conduct charge and the allegations upon which the charge is based. 2. A fair and impartial hearing. 3. Accompaniment by an Advisor of their choosing and expense at any time during the Student Conduct process. 4.

Additional Due Process Rights for Charged Students and Complainants: Both parties have the additional right to s ubmit an Impact Statement for use solely in the sanctioning phase if the Charged Student is found responsible for the Charge(s). e. Heari ng Notifications: At the time of issuing the hearing notice to the Charged Student, the Complainant will also be notified of the hearing. f. g. h.e. i.f. Hearing Procedures : 1. Hearing : To avoid re -victimizing the Charged Student and/or Complainant by having to retell their version of the events, the University determined that the traditional hearing should not be used for Title IX cases. 2. The Hearing Body, the Charged Student, and the Complainant will be given the final redacted investigation report at least thre e (3) Business Days prior to the hearing. During the hearing, the investigator(s) will provide a summary statement of the final investigation report.

Appeals are not a re- hearing of the Student Conduct matter but Page 168 of 205 39 are only a file and/or document review. The reason for the appeal must be based on at least one of th e following: 1. Violations of the appealing party's rights or other failure to follow the Student Conduct procedures that substantially affected the outcome of the initial hearing. Appeals based on this reason will be limited solely to a review of the record of the hearing ; 2. New information which was not available at the time of the hearing and could not have been presented. In addition, the appealing party must show that the new information could have substantially affected the outcome ; or 3. The severity of the sanction is disproportionate to the nature of the Charge(s). c. Appeal Requests : All appeals must be written and submitted using the appeal form available in the decision letter. 1. The person wishing to appeal must complete the appeal form in full and send it to the appellate officer for receipt no later than 5:00pm of the seventh (7th) Business Day after the delivery date of the hearing decision letter.

Under these circumstances, a Charged Student shall remain eligible to attend classes and University activities pending the appeal. 3. If a Charged Student's privileges are temporarily revoked through an Interim Suspension and the Charged Student is subsequently found not responsible for the violation, the University must to the extent possible: i. Correct any record of the change in enrollment status in the Charged Student's permanent records and reports in a manner compliant with state and federal laws; and ii. Refund to the Charged Student a pro rata portion of any charges for tuition, and out-of-state fees, as appropriate, relating to the temporary revocation or suspension which affected the Charged Student's ability to attend classes for more than ten (10) Business Days. 4. If no appeal is requested, the sanctions will take effect immediately. f. Appellate Review/Decision : 1. No person may hear or decide an appeal if they conducted or participated in the Student Conduct Code proceeding being reviewed on appeal. 2. The Appellate Officer shall first determine if sufficient grounds for the appeal exists and then, if so, may either de ny the appeal, thus sustaining the initial decision and sanction(s), or do one of the following: i. If the basis of the appeal is that the severity of the sanction was disproportionate to the nature of the offense and the Appellate Officer finds the appealing party proved their allegation, the Appellate Officer may modify the sanction. Page 169 of 205 40 ii. If the basis of the appeal is that there was a failure to follow the Student Conduct procedures that substantially affected the outcome, or that there was new information which was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing and could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, which would have substantially affected the outcome and the Appellate Officer finds that the appealing party proved their all egation, the Appellate Officer will order a new hearing. g. Written Decision on Appeal : The appellate decision is issued in writing to the Charged Student or Student Organization within twenty -one (21) Business Days of receipt of the written request for appea l unless notification is given that additional time is necessary for consideration of the record on appeal. h.

CONFLICT RESOLUTION a. Not every matter processed through SCCR is required to go through summary resolution or a hearing.

An avenue utilized by the SCCR to foster mutual respect and understanding when differences arise is Conflict Resolution. Conflict Resolution through SCCR is an informal and confidential process. b. Conflict Resolution may be utilized where the inc ident in question is minor in nature, and the parties involved chose not to proceed with charges through the University Student Conduct system.

Conflict Resolution cases handled through SCCR will not be identified or filed as a Student Conduct matter. Conflict Resolution records will be maintained separate from Student Conduct files and will not be recorded or reported as part of a Charged Student's record. All Conflict Resolution files are confidential and will not be released without written consent except in cases where the conduct or behavior is a repeat offense. In repeat cases, this information is only released to the Hearing Body and only used if the Charged Student is found responsible for a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. d. Conflict Resolution files are kept for seven (7) years from the date of the resolution. e. Incident(s) considered serious in nature, and consequently not suitable for Conflict Resolution, include, but are not limited to, sexual misconduct, endangerment, personal abuse, hazing, a crime of violence, illegal drugs, alcohol, weapons or other violations of federal, state and local ordinances. f. Participation must be voluntary, and either party can request to end Conflict Resolution at any time which may result in the initiation of the Student Conduct process for the behavior. 21. INTERPRETATION AND REVISION a. Any question of interpretation or application of the Student Code of Conduct shall be referred to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee for final determination. b. The Student Code of Conduct shall be reviewed periodically by a committee which shall include Student representation under the direction of the SCCR Director. b.c.

Page 189 of 205 This page intentionally left blank Agenda Item 3 AP8 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee June19, 2019 Subject : New Program Proposal : Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digita l Arts Proposed Committee Action: Recommend to the Florida International Uni versity Board of Trustees approv al of the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digita l Arts (CIP 50.0102) new program proposal. Background Information: The Department of Art + Art History is proposing a new Bachelor of Fine Art s in Digital Arts (STEM) CIP code 50 .0102. The BFA in Digital Arts is designed to prepare students for technological and conceptual relevance within contemporary digital arts practi ce. The Florida B oard of G overnors has defined Digital Arts as a \"Strategic Emphasis\" and outlined careers in this field as a key to the economic development of Florida. Students graduating from the BFA in Digital Arts degree program will be equipped with the appropriate skill set s to excel in an increasingly technologically driven society with careers available in motion graphics, prototype design, digital fabrication, digital photography, and digital audiovisual artworks. The proposed degree will offer tracks in Grap hic Design and Animation in place of the current Graphic Design and Digital Arts tracks under BFA -Art degree program. Each university board of trustees shall approve for implementation new degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, advanced master's, and specialist levels in accordance with sections (3) and (5) of Fl orida Board of Governors Regula tion 8.011 - Authorization of New Academic Degree Programs and Other Curricular Offerings. Supporting Documentation: Executive Summary: Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digita l Arts (CIP 50.0102) New Program Proposal Facilitator/Presenter: Elizabeth M. Bejar Page 190 of 205 This page intentionally left blank Proposed Bachelor of Fine Art s in Digital Arts Department of Art + Art History College of Communication, Architecture + The Arts Florida International University EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Department of Art + Art History is proposing a new Bachelor of Fine Art s in Digital Arts (STEM) CIP code 50.0102. The BFA in Digital Arts is designed to prepare students for technological and conceptual relevance within contemporary digital arts practi ce. Students are encouraged to push the boundaries of new media, explore emerging technologies and participate in the evolution of digital arts as an interdisciplinary exploration within the field of fine arts. The proposed degree will offer tracks in Grap hic Design and Animation in place of the current Graphic Design and Digital Arts tracks under BFA -Art degree program. Creating the BFA in Digital Arts degree program supports the strategic initiatives of the College of Communication, Architecture + the A rts (CARTA) and the University by providing a more technologically focused program of study with fine arts and design. The Florida B oard of Governors (BOG) has defined Digital Arts as a \"Strategic Emphasis\" and outlined careers in this field as a key to the economic development of Florida. Students graduating from the BFA in Digital Arts degree program will be equipped with the appropriate skill set s to exce l in an increasingly technologically driven society with careers available in motion graphics, prototype design, digital fabrication, digital photography, and digital audiovisual artworks. The State University System of Florida (SUS) Academic Program In ventory lists only two SUS program s (UF, UCF) as designated with CIP code 50.0102 for Digital Arts. Their combined undergraduate enrollment grew from 805 in 2010 to 1,130 in 2017 - marking an increase of 40.37 %. However, these programs are both located in the central and northern part of Florida. Offering a BFA in Digital Arts in South Florida would keep students close the local job market and provide access to those who wish to pursue an education in Digital Arts but are unable to relocate for college. Student demand can be measured in the growth of applic ants to our current BFA in Art - Graphic Design and Digital Arts tracks. Spring 2019, seventy -one portfolios were submitted. Of these seventy -one portfolios submitted, the nu mber of Digital Arts/Graphic Design portfolios was forty -one, of which twenty -one were admitted. That is a two -thirds majority in BFA applicants opting for Digital Arts/Graphic Design over Studio Arts. For Fall 2019, a total of sixty -two portfolios were su bmitted. Once again, the majority of portfolios submitted were for Digital Arts/Graphic Design. Forty portfolios were submitted to Digital Arts/Graphic Design, of which twenty were admitted. Page 191 of 205 This page intentionally left blank US Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Florida as the fifth largest employer of digital artists and the third largest employer of graphic designers (https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes271014.htm#st ). US Census 2017 Data estim ates 20, 984, people live in Florida ( https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fl ). The densest portion of the population resides in the South Florida with 2,751,796 in Miami -Dade County, 1,935,878 in Browa rd County, and 1,471,150 in Palm Beach County. FIU directly serves all three of these densely populated counties, which make up 29.35% of the entire state's population. Digital Arts is made up of key components of the digital and tech industry. Digital Arts consists of various subfields such as graphic design, animation, motion graphics, video production, illustration, concept and product design, web designers, mobile app lications, and game development. South Florida and the Greater Miami Metro area are home to an array of national and international design firms and production studios. The Beacon Council data reveals that the Creative Design industry in Miami -Dade County a lone, consists of 3,926 companies employing 37, 032 people. South Florida's regional positioning in the Southeastern US, as well as its connection to international markets, appeals to new industries, international corporations, and tech -driven companies. Offering a BFA in Digital Arts will allow FIU to attract new collaborations and funding sources from businesses operating in the region. Students will not be forced to relocate to seek education and employment instead they will be positioned as \"ready to be hired\" upon graduation. Housed in the College of Communication, Architecture + Arts, students in BFA Digital Arts program will benefit from the following fully -funded digital labs. 1. Robotics and Digital Fabrication Laboratory (RDF) - a state -of-the-art facility with robotic arms, 3D scanners, laser cutters, programmable objects, and 3D printers. The lab's unique technology solutions for design, testing, prototyping, and fabrication are readily available resources for innovative pedag ogical methods. 2. iSTAR - CARTA has partnered with virtual reality purveyor Bridgegate Pictures to create this Immersive Studio for Altered Reality, at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC). 3. Ratcliffe Incubator - a unique and one -of-a-kind initiative in the St ate of Florida, aimed to promote and foster social entrepreneurship and innovation amongst upcoming FIU artists and designers. All three of these state -of-the-art facilities are accessible to the Department's students and encourage collaboration and resea rch across disciplines amplifying the potential for external funding.

FIU ComPASS FIU's Communication Protocol for Accountability and Strategic Support (ComPAS S) was developed in 2016 to aid in the University's achievement of its FIU BeyondPossible 2020 Performance Funding goals. The efforts of ComPASS are being actualized through significant improvements in the university's four -year graduation rate of our students, from 33% to 38.9% in the last two years of this exercise , reflecting another 5%+ increase year over year. Coupled with strategic recruitment efforts, the freshman class boasts a 4.1 GPA and 1257 SAT, th e highest freshman profile in the University's history. Both have come in part through the focus ed efforts of t he ComPASS exercise. The Spring 2019 ComPASS was held on April 16, 2019 and had a returned focus on r etention and graduation in order to maintain efforts on continuous improvement of thos e metrics for all colleges. Colleges presented on their various uniq ue initiatives to improve the retention of students at all academic levels and their plans to assist students to co mplete their degrees within four years. Various university -wide updates were given highlighting centralized progress in completing FIU's degr ee audit system for students to better track their career path . The launch of the Panther Success Network which allows for advisors to have mo re direct and frequent access with students. 2. FIU BEYOND POSSIBLE 2020 STRATEGIC PROJECTS FIUBeyondPossible 2020 strategic project plans have made progress within the last quarter. Below is a brief status report highlighting progress of some of the 33 projects. Social Innovation Ashoka recently finalized FIU's Changemaker Campus designation rene wal, acknowledging the university -wide plan for Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship (SI&E) related programs included in the renewal application prepared by ORED, StartUP FIU and the Off ice of the Provost. The FIU SI&E website (change.fiu.edu) has expanded and is now accessible for our community of changemakers. FIU's inaugural Changemaker Week was held March 26 -28, 2019 as the flagship event of the SI&E program. Over 400 students attended three days of events and learned about changemaking, social impact and en trepreneurship. The week was kicked -off by President Rosenberg, AVP of Research and Economic Developmen t Emily Gresham and SGA President Sabrina Rosell. Students participated in events such as a Global Learning Solution Fair, Goja -iChange Social Impact Com petitions, Honors Innovation Roundtable, Office of Engagement Cafecito Hour and a visit to Venture Caf\u00e9 Miami. The Changemaker Week paved the road for a larger and more impactful event next year. Page 195 of 205Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Report s P. 3 Improve and Increase Hybrid Courses The \"Improve and Incre ase Hybrid Courses\" strategic initiative has expanded to over 1,500 hybrid section offerings yielding over 60,000 hybrid enrollments, over 150,000 student credit hours and achieving the involvement of over 300 hybrid certified instruc tors. The Fall 2018 number of sections offered has grown by 97% (260) from Fall 2017 while the Sp ring 2019 number of sections offered has grown by 68% (322) from Spring 2018. FIU Dual Enrollment Program 2018- 19 Highlights During academic Year 2018 -19, the FIU Dual Enrollment Program (DEP) has established partnerships with 72 schools in Miami -Dade, Broward and Orange Counties DEP to provide dual enrollment (DE) learning opportunities to 7,793 students. These st udents have re ceived DE instruction through both online and face to face modalities. The cours ework translates into 15,099 instances of enrollment. The total student headcount for this academic year increased by 16% when compared to 6,741 from the prior academic year. II. ACADEMIC AND CAREER SUCCESS 1. Predictive Analytics in Panther Success Network (PSN) FIU has implemented PSN's Student Success Predictive Model. The model us es FIU's historical student data to determine specific factors that indicate a student's likelihood of graduating in four years. It not only incorporates demographic and biog raphical data, but it is also a dynamic model that updates each term to incorporate a student's cur rent major and academic performance. Students are assigned a c olor in the system (red, yellow, or green) indicating their anticipated need for support (high, medium, or low). Advisors a nd administrators use the model as a tool to focus support in a way that has the highes t impact on student success. FIU has also begun piloting the success marker feature in PSN. Success m arkers are a set of critical course benchmarks that are predictive of a student's success in th e major. They include the term by which students should complete the course(s) and t he recommended grade threshold the student should receive in order to be considered on -track for four -year graduation. Advisors are alerted in PSN when a student misses a succes s marker. The students receive additional support and guidance to determine how to succe ed in their current major or to identify a different program that may be a better fit. Page 196 of 205Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Report s P. 4 2. University Learning Center The University Learning Center has continued to build and nurture relat ionships with faculty, tutors, and students. Spring 2019 term introduc ed two new learning strateg y programs in collaboration with the general chemistry and psychology faculty. These programs have contributed to an increase in student visits; spring term yielded 9,173 visits, Fall term yielded 8,967 visits, totaling 18,140 v isits. Analysis of comparable passing rates will be conducted using grades . The next learning strategies design will focus on developing students' critical thinking skills in physics. Last month , the University Learning Center hosted its 6th annual sympo sium, offering a variety of sessions dedicated to developing collaboration between faculty and academic support units. Tutors will continue their pedagogical development with their semi -annual tutor training program. The tutors are trained in methods appropriate for working with various levels of academic preparation as well as the various demographic populations of FIU. 3. Career Services During the Spring 2019 semester, Career and Talent Development (CTD) organized multiple career fairs focused on spe cific industries and majors (technical & engineering) as well as fairs designed for students of all majors. These career fairs drew over 470 recruiters representing 165 employers and over 1,500 students and alumni. In additio n, CTD engaged employers through various recruitment events (information session, empl oyer tabling, networking events, employer of the week, mentor Monday, Panther shadows and B BC career bash) hosting 87 companies and 970 students and alumni. On May 8th, CTD collaborated with the other SUS career centers to host the annual statewide job fair in Orlando with over 160 employers. FIU sponsored 3 buses takin g 150 students with an additional 100 to 150 traveling to the event on their own. III. ENGAGEMENT REPORT 1. Carnegie Community Engagement Classification The Office of Engagement led the completion of the 2020 Carnegie Community En gaged Re - Classification, submitted on April 15, 2019. The process of completing th is application revealed that at FIU, we are delivering on our engagement mission in both a d eep a nd wide manner with partners across a local to global range. We have seen th e more we consistently communicate and collaborate across units as it pertains to engagement, the s tronger we can become as an institution. We have also identified areas for growth that will help us with strengthening engagement capabilities and long -term impact. While our units have a general agreement on core principals around eng agement, we could benefit from taking time to contextualize engagement across different function s of the university. By collaborating with institutional leaders, we can ensure we have a common understanding about how engagement manifests in our research, teachin g and learning, Page 197 of 205Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Report s P. 5 advancement and business service enterprises. By going through this C arnegie 20 20 classification process, we had an opportunity to collaborate with other sim ilarly situated institutions about what engagement related nomenclature they are using an d factoring that insight into our own structure. This application showed that our insti tution needs to create an institution -wide framework for tracking, managing, assessing and measuring outcomes as it pertains to e ngagement related activity. The abundance of engagement related activities dema nd we create systems for higher interoperability of university stakeholders involved in Engagement. Our university must implement a robust system akin to a customer relationship m anagement (CRM) to help us manage our engagement related partnerships, track impa ct data, and utilize that data to inform our broader institutional performance metrics. The big takeaway here is that we must develop systems that enable us to have accountability on the engagement activities that are happening throughout the university. 2. Future of Work: Urban Potential Laboratories (UP Labs) Urban Potential Labs (UP Labs) launched its first cohort on March 2nd, 2019. The new initiative began with a group of twenty -three learners, varying significantly in age, race, and ethnicity and drawing from multiple communities in South Florida. The goal o f UP Labs is to prepare underemployed, residents without Bachelor degrees for middle -skills careers in high growth local industries . The first cohort is preparing for jobs in healthcare. The Office of Engagement organized a group of expert s to build the 14 -week curriculum including industry partners (Baptist Health South Florida and Nicklaus Children's Hos pital), and FIU faculty members and staff (Continuing Education, College of Nursing an d Health Sciences) to provide 'just -in-time' curric ulum for a 'just -in-time' workforce (South Florida residents). Learners will be placed at a healthcare facility through our network of pa rtners including, Baptist Health, Veteran's Affairs Hospital, Larkin Community Hospital and Nic klaus Children's Hospita l for job shadowing and job rotations at the end of the program. The proof of concept of this program will be brought into fruition at the graduation ceremon y which will take place on June 15th, 2019. The goal is that all twenty -three learners complete the program and attain full- time positions within the healthcare industry and/or continue their education to attain a degree. 3. Maya Angelou Community Breakfast On April 4th, the Office of Engagement organized the 3rd Annual Little Haiti Community Breakfast, a community -building event celebrating Maya Angelou's birthday and life through reflection and service to the community. The keynote address wa s provided by Nadege Green, Staff Reporter, WLRN Public Radio & Televis ion, who was joined by more than 80 community leaders in Little Haiti including local students and administra tors. Dr. Maya Angelou's grandson, Elliott Jones, also delivered remarks in celebr ation of his late grandmother.

Life Sciences South Florida (LSSF) Undergraduate STEM Symposium The 7th Annual Life Sciences South Florida STEM Undergraduate Research Sym posium was held at Florida Atlantic University on April 6th, 2019. The Symposium featured 96 poster research presentations and 20 oral research presentations across 11 aca demic institutions. Students were able to present their research and exercise their presentation and analytic skills, as they presented their work to judges and symposium guests. Meanwhile, judges and guest faculty were able to make meaningful connections and see the outcomes of th eir advising and mentoring undergraduate student researchers. Provost Danilowicz of FAU was present and gave the welcom ing remarks followed by Saif Y. Ishoof, FIU Vice President for Engagement. The keynote speaker was Dr. Ken Dawson - Scully, Associate VP for Strategic Initiatives at Florida Atlantic Univers ity and Associate Director of the FAU Brain Institute. Additionally, there was a lunch panel that included industry leaders and academics in STEM. The purpose of the panel was to info rm undergraduate researchers about the post -baccalaureate opportunities available in South Florida, both within the life sciences industry an d graduate schools. Importantly, student researchers at the Symposium were predominantly women and the winners w ere all women \u2014illustrating the strong presence, academic successes and rigorous resea rch being conducted by undergraduate women in STEM across S outh Florida colleges and universities. The strong presence of undergraduate women is significant considerin g their historic and current underrepresentation in STEM fields nationally. Jesenia Perez from FIU won 2nd place for her oral presentation. IV. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES REPORT 1. University Admissions For the Summer and Fall 2019 recruitment cycle, FIU implemented a highly selective admission strategy. Of 20,886 applicants, FIU admitted 12,448 FTIC students to one of three terms within our 12 pathways. Despite national projections indicating that incoming classes of FTIC would shrink due to birthrate declines in the early 2000's (to now), our applicant and admission percentages from 2018 to 2019 have remained relatively constant. As opposed to declining with population, FIU managed the size of the 2019 incoming class based on changes that we re implemented in our GPA and test score requirements for admission. Page 199 of 205Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Report s P. 7 As part of our compliance with guidance from the Florida Board of Governors , FIU did decrease the size of the freshman class by approximately 11%. As of the n ational May 1 decision day, 1,689 FTIC have matriculated for the Fall term and 2,737 for the Early Fall Term. FIU traditionally experiences a 13% melt over the Summer meaning that the projection for the incoming Fall term is 1,469 and 2,382 for Early Fall enrollment. We increased the academic profile for all tracked cohorts of FTIC over the same cohorts for the 2018 cycle. Table 1 provides basic summaries for the 2019 FTIC; please note the foll owing: 1. Preeminence cohort includes any matriculated FTIC that we re admitted for the Fall term whether they attend full -time or not. 2. The Four -Year Graduation co hort includes FTIC that we admitted for the Early Fall (Summer B) or Fall terms and must attend full -time during the Fall . 3. The Six Year Graduation cohort includes any FTIC admitted for the Early Fall or Fall who enroll in at least on credit hour during the Fall term. Table 1 Early Fall and Fall FTIC Academic Profile Averages by Cohort of Interest Cohort Average GPA Average SAT Average ACT Six Year Graduation 4.03 1202 26 Four Year Graduation 4.07 1209 26 Preeminence 4.24 1294 28 New transfer student admissions has increased even as enrollment at F IU's largest feeder school, Miami Dade College, has decreased. Transfer applicants for the Summer term has increased by 18.24% for Summer and admits have increased by 19.65%. We anticipat e this trend to continue through to enrollment. Currently there are 165 more mat riculated transfer students overall for the 2019 -2020 cycle and 134 more enrolled. 2. Financial Aid New Student Aid Awards Awarding for new incoming Fall 2019 Freshman students began on December 21, 2018, the earliest ever at FIU and a week earlier than the prior year. Early awards are key in meeting Emerging Preeminence goals. The table shows the number of new students p ackaged as of April 25, 2019 as compared to last year. Page 200 of 205Florida International University Board of Trustees Academic Policy and Student Affairs Committee APSA Academic Affairs Report s P. 8 Comparison of Awards as of 4/5/2018-2019 Awarding Group 2018 2019 Early Fall Freshmen 1,769 1,570 Fall Freshmen 2,745 3,176 Fall Transfers 1,476 1,359 Total 5,990 6,105 3. Office of Scholarships During the Fall 2018- S pring 2019, the Office of Scholarship assisted over 800 students in applying for scholarships resulting in over $602,000 in scholarship awards . We continue to execute the Strategic Plan 2020 initiative of centralizing scholarships across the university to be managed through our office; currently, we are 90% complete. During thi s academic year we successfully launched the Emergency Aid appeal process; this streamlin ed process allows students to submit a petition for emergency financial support to achieve their degree goals. Lastly, we awarded over 750 students $1.7 million in First Generation scho larships. 4. University Registrar As part of the \"Sessions within Terms\" calendar redesign project, the University Registrar developed a proc ess modification that allows students to register for courses that require prere quisites within the same term. Historically, the automated enrollment tech nology would prevent this type of registration pattern. For example, students, historically, could not enroll in English Composition I and English Composition II in different session s within the same semester; this enrollment pattern would require human inter vention that presented students with substantial inconvenience. Through the Fall 2018 semester, the University Registrar's technical modified existing enrollment checking processes to accommodate sessions within term. After s ubstantial testing, the department implemented the new process in spring 2019 with four courses setup for intersession enrollment. Results of this pilot test exceeded the operationa l requirements for general deployment. In Summer 2019, the department will build 165 course sections to accommodate intersession enrollment. Our self -service enrollment engine faci litated 2,957 enrollment actions that previously would have failed due to prerequisite errors. We are currently setting up course sections for intersession enrollment for Fall 2019 and forward.
