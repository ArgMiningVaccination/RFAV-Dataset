At their meeting in May 2004, Health Ministers asked the OECD to work with national administrations to improve the evidence base for comparing health system performance by: 1) ensuring that OECD Health Data would be timely and accurate; 2) continuing the im plementation of health accounts to improve the availability and comparability of health expenditure and financing data; and 3) developingindicators of quality of care and health outcomes in collaboration with national experts. Substantial progress has been achieved in all of these areas, and this is reflected by the broader range ofindicators of inputs, outputs and outcomes of health systems presented in this publication. The production of Health at a Glance would not have been possible without the contribution of OECD Health Data National Co rrespondents, Health Accounts Experts, and experts involved in the Health Care Quality Indicators project. The OECD gratefully acknowledges their effort to supply most of the data and qualitative information contained in this publication. Th e OECD also acknowledges the contribution of other internat ional organisations, especially th e World Health Organisation and Eurostat, for sharing some of the data presented here, and the European Commission for supporting data development work in the area of health accounts and quality of care indicators. This publication was prepared by a team from th e OECD Health Division under the co-ordination of Ga\u00e9tan Lafortune and Michael de Looper.

The OECD has long been an international le ader in the development of tools and collection of data for assessing the performanc e of health systems. OECD work to improve the comparability of health statistics goes back to the 1980s when efforts began to improvethe comparability of health expenditure data, at a time when concerns emerged on rapidlyrising health spending and the growing pressures on both public and private financing(OECD, 1985). The release of the manual, A System of Health Accounts , in 2000 provided a renewed impetus and key tool for the OECD to strengthen this effort to improve the comparability of health expenditure data across a larger group of countries, working inclose collaboration with WHO and Eurostat. While comparable data on health spending are necessary to assess the amount of financial resources that countries allocate to health, they are obviously not sufficient to assess the performance of health systems. The OECD effort to improve the comparabilityof health statistics was broadened to cover the supply and activities of health workers andphysical resources in health care systems. F ollowing the meeting of OECD Health Ministers in 2004, the OECD further extended its effort to assemble comparable data for assessing health system performance through developin g and collecting a set of indicators to measure the quality of care and the outcomes of health interventions. In addition, initialwork has been undertaken on a set of indica tors related to access to care, another key objective of health systems across OECD coun tries. The OECD continues to work with experts in its member states and with other international organisations to fill gaps in theassessment and comparison of health system performance. Policy, economic and social context Beginning in the second half of 2008, OECD countries entered into a deep economic recession. The June 2009 OECD projections indicate that GDP may decline by about 4% inthe OECD area in 2009, and unemployment rate is projected to reach about 10% of the labour force by the end of 2010 (OECD, 2009b). Government budgets provide a very import ant cushion for economic activity in the downturn, mainly through automatic stabilisers and discretionary spending or taxreductions. However, the result has been a marked increase in government deficits. Whenthe economic recovery is sufficiently firm, substantial reductions in budget deficits will be required in many countries. The extent of government spending reductions and/or tax increases will depend on the strength of the recovery and the size of the deficit andcumulative debt.INTRODUCTION HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 10Given that health spending accounts for a high and growing share of public budgets, it will be hard to protect it from any general effo rt to control public spending during or after the recession. The extent to which public spending on health may be affected will depend on the relative priority allocated to health comp ared to other priorities. It will also depend on the extent to which public spending on he alth brings demonstrated benefits in terms of better health outcomes for the population. In a context of scarce public resources, therewill be growing pressures on Health Ministries and health care providers to demonstrateefficiency (cost-effectiveness) in how resour ces are allocated and spent. Chapter 5 presents some of the progress achieved thus far in measuring quality of care and health outcomes across countries, while noting that the set of measures is still partial and further effort isneeded to improve data comparability. Structure of the publication The framework underlying this publication allows for examining the performance of health care systems in the context of a broader view of public health (Figure 0.1). This framework is based on one that has been endorsed for the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators project (Kelley and Hurst, 2006; Arah et al. , 2006). The framework highlights that the goal of health (care) systems is to improve the health status of the population. Many factors influence the health stat us of the population, including those falling outside health care systems, such as the social, economic andphysical environment in which people live, and individual lifestyle and behavioural Figure 0.1.

The performance of health care syste ms also contributes to the health status of the population. This performance includes several dimensions, most notably the degree of access to care and the quality of care provided. Performance measurement also needs totake into account the financial resources required to achieve these access and qualitygoals. The performance of health systems depe nds on the people providing the services, and the training, technology and equipment that are at their disposal. Finally, a number of factors are related to health care system perf ormance, such as the demographic, economic and social context, and the design of health systems. Health at a Glance 2009 provides comparisons across OECD countries on each component of this framework. It is organised as follows: Chapter 1 on Health Status highlights large variations across countries in life expectancy, mortality and other measures of population health status. Chapter 2 on Non-medical Determinants of Health focuses on selected determinants related to modifiable lifestyles and behaviours. The chapter has been extended this year to coverrisk or protective factors among children, such as nutrition habits, physical activity,smoking and alcohol drinking. These complement the set of adult risk factor indicators. Chapter 3 looks at the Health Workforce , the key actors in any health system. This new chapter provides information on the supply and remuneration of doctors and nurses,and recent trends on the international mi gration of doctors in OECD countries. Chapter 4 reviews a key set of Health Care Activities , both within and outside hospitals. It examines cross-country variations in the supply and use of medical technologies, such asmedical resonance imaging (MRI) units and computed tomography (CT) scanners. It alsolooks at variations in the use of high-volume and high-cost procedures, such as coronaryartery bypass graft and coronary angioplasty, caesarean sections, and cataract surgeries. Chapter 5 on Quality of Care provides comparisons on selected indicators of quality with respect to care for chronic conditions, mental disorders, cancers and communicablediseases. The measures include indicators of process of care that is recommended for certain population or patient groups to maximise desired outcomes, and key outcomes measures such as survival rates following heart attack, stroke and cancer. Chapter 6 is a new chapter on Access to Care, and aims to fill the gap in measuring this important dimension of health system performance. It begins with a limited number ofindicators related to financial and geographic access. The intent is to expand this chapterin future editions, once further progress has been achieved in indicator development anddata collection. Chapter 7 on Health Expenditure and Financing compares how much OECD countries spend on health, both overall and for different type s of health services and goods. It also looks at how these health services and goods are paid for in different countries ( i.e. the mix between public funding, private health insurance where it exists, and out-of-pocketpayments by patients). Annex A provides some additional information on the demographic and economiccontext within which health systems operate, as well as some key characteristics of health system financing and delivery. This can assist readers in interpreting theindicators presented in the main body of the publication. An increasing number of OECD countries are regularly publishing reports on different aspects of health and the performance of th eir health care systems. Examples of suchINTRODUCTION HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 12national reports include A Set of Performance Indicators acro ss the Health and Aged Care System in Australia (AIHW, 2008e), the Dutch Health Care Performance Report in the Netherlands (RIVM, 2008), Quality and Efficiency in Swedish Health Care in Sweden (Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and National B oard of Health and Welf are, 2008), and the National Healthcare Quality Report together with the National Healthcare Disparities Report in the United States (AHRQ, 2008a and 2008b). These national reports often focus on variations across different regions within the country. The Dutch performance reportprovides a good example of how such national reports may also be enriched by includinginternational comparisons, to provide a broader perspective on the relative strengths andweaknesses of the national health system and identify potential areas for improvement. Presentation of indicators Each of the topics covered in the different chapters of this publication is presented over two pages. The first provides a brie f commentary highlighting the key findings conveyed by the data, defines indicators and discloses any significant national variationsfrom that definition which might affect data comparability. On the facing page is a set offigures. These figures typically show current levels of the indicator and, where possible,trends over time. In some cases, an additional figure relating the indicator to anothervariable is included. Where an OECD average is included in a figure, it is the unweighted average of the countries presented, unless ot herwise specified in the accompanying notes. Data limitations Limitations in data comparability are indicated both in the text (in the box related to \"Definition and deviations\") as well as in footnotes to figures. Readers should exerciseparticular caution when considering time trends for Germany. Data for Germany up to 1990generally refer to West Germany and data for subsequent years refer to unified Germany.

Regarding Chapter 5 on Quality of Care , more information on definitions, sources and methods underlying the data is available atwww.oecd.org/health/hcqi . Population figures The population figures presented in Annex A and used to calculate rates per capita throughout this publication come mainly from the OECD Labour Force Statistics Database(as at April 2009), and refer to mid-year estimates. Popula tion estimates are subject to revision, so they may differ from the latest population figures released by nationalstatistical offices of OECD member countries. Note that some countries such as France , the United Kingdom and the United States have overseas colonies, protectorates and territories. These popu lations are generally excluded. The calculation of GDP per capita and other economic measures may, however, be based on a different population in these countries, depending on the data coverage.INTRODUCTION HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 13Country codes (ISO codes) List of acronyms AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ALOS Average length of stay AMI Acute myocardial infraction ATC Anatomic-therapeutic classification BMI Body Mass Index disease CAT (or CT) Computed axial tomography CHF Congestive heart failure COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease DDD Defined daily dose DMFT Decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth EHR Electronic health record ESRF End-stage renal failure EU-SILC European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey GDP Gross domestic product GP General practitioner HBSC Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey HCQI Health Care Quality Indicators (OECD Project) HIV Human immunodeficiency virus ICHA International Classification for Health Accounts IHD Ischemic heart disease ISIC International Standard Industrial Classification MRI Medical resonance imaging PPP Purchasing power parities PSI Patient safety indicators PYLL Potential years of life lost SHA System of Health Accounts SIDS Sudden infant death syndrome UPI Unique patient identifiersAustralia AUS Korea KOR Austria AUT Luxembo urg LUX Belgi um BEL Mexico MEX Canada CAN Denmark DNK Norway NOR Finland FIN Poland POL France FRA Portugal PRT Germany DEU Slovak Rep ublic Sweden SWE Iceland ISL Switzer land CHE Ireland IRL Turkey TUR Italy ITA United Ki ngdom GBR Japa n JPN United State s USAHEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 151.

Life expectancy at birth Life expectancy at birth has continued to increase remarkably in OECD countries, reflecting sharp reduc- tions in mortality rates at all ages. These gains in longevity can be attributed to a number of factors, including rising living standards, improved lifestyleand better education, as well as greater access to quality health services. Other factors, such as better nutrition, sanitation and housing also play a role, par- ticularly in countries with developing economies (OECD, 2004c). On average across OECD countries, life expectancy at birth for the whole population reached 79.1 years in 2007, a gain of more than ten years since 1960 (Figure 1.1.1). In almost one-half of OECD countries,life expectancy at birth in 2007 exceeded 80 years. The country with the highest li fe expectancy was Japan, with a life expectancy for women and men combinedof 82.6 years. At the other end of the scale, life expec- tancy in OECD countries was the lowest in Turkey, fol- lowed by Hungary. However, while life expectancy in Hungary has increased modestly since 1960, it has increased sharply in Turkey, so that it is rapidly catch- ing up with the OECD average (OECD and the World Bank, 2008). Life expectancy at birth in Korea, Turkey, Ireland and Portugal has in creased by three years or more in the ten-year period 1997-2007. The gender gap in life expectancy stood at 5.6 years on average across OECD countries in 2007, with life expectancy reaching 76.3 years among men and 81.9 years among women (Figure 1.1.2). Between 1960 and 2007, this gender gap widened on average by about half a year. But this result hides different trends between earlier and later decades. While the gendergap in life expectancy increased substantially in many countries during the 1960s and the 1970s, it narrowed during the past 25 years, refl ecting higher gains in life expectancy among men than among women in mostOECD countries. The recent narrowing of the gender gap in life expectancy can be attributed at least partly to the narrowing of differences in risk-increasing behaviours between men and women, such as smok- ing, accompanied by sharp reductions in mortality rates from cardio-vascular diseases among men. Higher national income (as measured by GDP per capita) is generally associat ed with higher life expec- tancy at birth, although the relationship is less pronounced at higher le vels of national income(Figure 1.1.3). There are also notable differences in lifeexpectancy between OECD countries with similar income per capita. Japan and Spain have higher, and the United States, Denmark and Hungary lower life expectancies than would be predicted by their GDP per capita alone. Figure 1.1.4 shows the relationship between life expec- tancy at birth and health expenditure per capita across OECD countries. Higher health spending per capita is generally associated with higher life expectancy at birth, although this relationship tends to be less pro- nounced in countries with hi gher health spending per capita. Again, Japan and Spain stand out as having relatively high life expectancies, and the United States, Denmark and Hungary relatively low life expectancies, given their levels of health spending. Variations in GDP per capita may influence both life expectancy and health expenditure per capita. Many other factors, beyond national income and total health spending also explain variations in life expec- tancy across countries. Definition and deviations Life expectancy measures how long on averagepeople would live based on a given set of age- specific death rates. However, the actual age- specific death rates of any particular birth cohort cannot be known in advance. If age-specific death rates are falling (as has been the case over the past decades in OECD countries), actual life spans will be higher than life expectancy calcu- lated with current death rates. Each country calculates its life expectancy according to methodologies that can vary some- what. These differences in methodology can affect the comparability of reported life expec- tancy estimates, as different methods can change a country's life expectancy estimates by a fraction of a year. Life expectancy at birth for the total population is calculated by the OECD Secretariat for all countries, using the unweighted average of life expectancy of men and women.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.2. Life expectancy at age 65 Life expectancy at age 65 has increased significantly among both women and men over the past several decades in all OECD countries. Some of the factorsexplaining the gains in life expectancy at age 65 include advances in medical care combined with greater access to health care, healthier lifestyles and improved living conditions before and after people reach age 65. In 2007, life expectancy at age 65 in OECD countries stood, on average, at over 20 years for women and close to 17 years for men (Figure 1.2.1). This represents a gain of almost five years for women and four years for men on average across OECD countries since 1970. Hence, the gender gap in life expectancy at age 65 increased slightly in many countries between 1970 and 2007. Similarly, life expectancy at age 80 also increased slightly more rapidly among women than among men on average in OECD countries over the past 37 years (Figure 1.2.2). In 2007, life expectancy for women at age 80 stood at 9.2 years (up from 6.5 years in 1970) on average in OECD countries, while the corresponding figure for men was 7.6 years (up from 5.6 years in 1970). Japan registered particularly strong gains in life expec- tancy at age 65 in recent decades, with an increase of over eight years for women and six for men between 1970 and 2007. As a result of these large gains, Japanese women and men enjoyed the longest life expectancy at age 65 across all OECD countries in 2007, with respectively 23.6 and 18.6 remaining years of life. These gains in Japan can be explained in part by a marked reduction in death rates from heart disease and cerebro-vascular disease (stroke) among elderly people. Many other OECD countries ha ve also registered signifi- cant reductions in mortality from cardio-vascular andcerebro-vascular diseases among elderly populations over the past decades (OECD, 2003a; Moon et al. , 2003). Some countries exhibit different standings when comparing their life expectancies at birth and at age 65. Females in Belgium, the United States and New Zealand improve their position relative to other countries, as do males in the United States, France and Mexico. However, males in the Netherlands,Sweden and Luxembourg, rate lower at 65 years of age, compared with at birth. Gains in longevity at older ages in recent decades in OECD countries, combined with the trend reduction infertility rates, are contributing to a steady rise in theproportion of older person s in OECD countries (see Annex Tables A.2 and A.3). Life expectancy at age 65 is expected to continue to increase in coming decades. Based on the United Nations/World Bank Population Database, life expec- tancy at age 65 is projected to reach 21.6 years for women and 18.1 years in 2040 for men on average in OECD countries (OECD, 2007d). Whether longer life expectancy is accompanied by good health and functional status among ageing pop- ulations has important impl ications for health and long-term care systems. Recent OECD work has foundthat although there is a declining trend in severe dis-ability among elderly populations in some countries (e.g. in the United States, It aly and the Netherlands), this is not universally true (Figure 1.2.3). In some othercountries ( e.g. in Australia and Canada), the rate of severe disability is stable, and in yet other countries(e.g. in Sweden and Japan) severe limitations in activi- ties of daily living appear to be on the rise over thepast five to ten years. Combined with population ageing, these trends suggest that there will be increas- ing need for long-term care in all OECD countries in coming decades (Lafortune et al. , 2007). Definition and deviations Life expectancy measures how long on average people at a particular age would live based on current age-specific death rates. However, the actual age-specific death rates of any particular birth cohort cannot be known in advance. If age-specific death rates are falling - as has been the case over the past decades in OECD countries - actual life spans will be higher than life expec- tancy calculated with current death rates. Countries may calculate life expectancy using methodologies that can vary somewhat. These differences in methodology can affect the compa- rability of reported life expectancy estimates by a fraction of a year.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.3. Premature mortality Premature mortality, measured in terms of potential years of life lost (PYLL) before the age of 70 years, focuses on deaths among younger age groups of the population. PYLL values are heavily influenced by infant mortality and deaths from diseases and inju- ries affecting children and younger adults: a death at five years of age represents 65 PYLL; one at 60 years of age only ten. Declines in PYLL can be influenced by advances in medical technology, for example, in relation to infant mortality and deaths due to heart disease, and in prevention and control measures, reducing untimely or avoidable deaths from injuries and communicable diseases. A number of other vari- ables, such as GDP per capita, occupational status, numbers of doctors and alcohol and tobacco consumption, have also been associated with reducedpremature mortality (Or, 2000; Joumard et al. , 2008). Rates of premature mortalit y are higher among males in all countries, with the OECD average in 2006 (4 853 years lost per 100 000 males) almost twice that of females (2 548). The main causes of potential years of life lost before age 70 among men are external causes including accidents and violence (29%), fol- lowed by cancer (20%) and circulatory diseases (16%). For women, the principal causes are cancer (31%), external causes (17%), and circulatory diseases (12%). Among males, Sweden and Iceland had the lowest levels of premature mortality in 2006, and for females levels were lowest in Japan and Italy (Figure 1.3.1). Mexico and Hungary reported the highest premature mortality rates for both males and females, with levels more than double those of the lowest OECD country. The rate for the Un ited States was also high - 30% above the OECD average in the case of males,and 43% for females. Among US males, one-third (and in females, one-fifth) of these premature mortality rates can be attributed to deaths resulting from exter- nal causes, including accidents, suicides and homi-cides. Premature death from homicides for men in the United States is over five times the OECD average. Across OECD countries, premature mortality has been cut by more than half on average since 1970 (Figure 1.3.2). The decline in premature mortality was more rapid for females than for males between 1970and the early 1990s, but since then the average rate of PYLL has been declining at the same rate for men and women. The downward trend in infant mortality has been a major factor cont ributing to the decline in earlier years (see Indicator 1.8 \"Infant mortality\"). More recently, the decline in deaths from heart disease among adults has contributed significantly to the overall reduction in premature mortality in many countries (see Indicator 1.4 \"Mortality from heart disease and stroke\"). Portugal and Italy have seen premature mortality rates decline rapidly among both males and females to stand currently at less than one-third of 1970 levels. Although levels are still high, Mexico has also seen a dramatic decline. In each case, the sharp reduction in infant mortality rates has been an important contrib- uting factor. In contrast , premature mortality has declined more slowly in Hungary, particularly amongmales. This is largely attributed to persistently high levels of mortality from circulatory disease (currently twice the OECD average) and from liver disease (over three times the OECD average). These reflect unhealthy lifestyles, in particular alcohol and tobacco consumption among males in Hungary, together with high suicide rates. Declines in premature mortality have also been slow in Poland and the United States. Definition and deviations Potential years of life lost (PYLL) is a summary measure of premature mortality providing an explicit way of weighting deaths occurring at younger ages. The calculation for PYLL involves adding age-specific deaths occurring at each age and weighing them by the number of remainingyears to live up to a se lected age limit, defined here as age 70. For example, a death occurring at five years of age is counted as 65 years of PYLL. The indicator is expressed per 100 000 females and males.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.4. Mortality from heart disease and stroke Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of mortal- ity in almost all OECD countries, accounting for 36% of all deaths in 2006. They cover a range of diseases related to the circulatory system, including ischemic heart disease (known as IHD, or heart attack) and cerebro-vascular disease (or stroke). Together, IHD and stroke comprise two-thirds of all cardiovascular deaths, and caused one-quarter of all deaths in OECD countries in 2006. Ischemic heart disease is caused by the accumulation of fatty deposits lining the inner wall of a coronary artery, restricting blood flow to the heart. IHD alone was responsible for 16% of all deaths in OECD coun- tries in 2006. Mortality from IHD varies considerably,however, across OECD countries (Figure 1.4.1). Central and eastern European coun tries report the highest IHD mortality rates, the Slovak Republic for bothmales and females, followed by Hungary and the Czech Republic. IHD mortality rates are also relatively high in Finland, Poland and the United States, with rates several times higher than in Japan and Korea. There are regional patterns to the variability in IHD mortality rates. Closely following the two OECD Asian countries, the countries with the lowest IHD mortality rates are four countries located in southern Europe: France, Spain, Portugal and Italy. This lends support to the commonly held hypothesis that there are underlying risk factors, such as diet, which explain differences in IHD mortality across countries. Death rates are much higher for men than for women in all countries (Figure 1.4.1). On average across OECD countries, IHD mortality rates in 2006 were nearly two times greater for men than for women. Since 1980, IHD mortality rates have declined in nearly all OECD countries. The decline has been most remarkable in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Australia, with IHD mortality rates being cut by two-thirds or more. A number of factors are responsible, with declining tobacco consumption contributing to reducing the incidence of IHD, and consequently reducing IHD mortality rates. Signifi- cant improvements in medical care for treating IHD have also contributed to reducing mortality rates (Mo\u00efse et al. , 2003) (see Indicators 4.6 \"Cardiac proce-dures\" and 5.4 \"In-hospital mortality following acute myocardial infarction\"). A small number of countries, however, have seen little or no decline since 1980. In Hungary and Poland, mortality rates have increased. The rate in Greece has declined only slightly, although it was already comparatively low in 1980. Stroke is another important cause of mortality in OECD countries, accounting for ab out 9% of all deaths in 2006. It is caused by the disruption of the blood supply to thebrain, and in addition to being an important cause of mortality, the disability burd en from stroke is substan- tial (Moon et al. , 2003). As with IHD, there are large variations in stroke mortality rates across countries (Figure 1.4.1). The rates are highest in Portugal, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Greece. They are the lowest in Switzerland, France, Canada and the Unit ed States. Looking at trends over time, stroke mortality hasdecreased in all OECD countries (except Poland) since 1980. Rates have declined by almost three- quarters in Austria, Japan, Luxembourg, Ireland and France. As with IHD, the reduction in stroke mortality can be attributed at least partly to a reduction in risk factors. Tobacco smoking and hypertension are the main modifiable risk factors for stroke. Improvements in medical treatment for stroke have also increased survival rates (see Indicator 5.5 \"In-hospital mortality following stroke\"). Definition and deviations Mortality rates are based on the crude number of deaths according to selected causes in the WHO Mortality Database. Mathers et al. (2005) have provided a general assessment of the coverage,completeness and reliability of WHO data on causes of death. Mortality rates have been age- standardised to the 1980 OECD population, to remove variations arising from differences in age structures across countries and over time within each country.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.5. Mortality from cancer Cancer is the second lead ing cause of mortality in OECD countries (after diseases of the circulatory system), accounting for 27% of all deaths on average in 2006. In 2006, cancer mortality rates were the lowest in Mexico, Finland, Switzerland and Japan. They were the highest in central and eastern European countries (Hungary, the Czech and SlovakRepublics, Poland) and Denmark (Figure 1.5.1). Cancer mortality rates are higher for men than for women in all OECD countries (Figure 1.5.1). In 2006, the gender gap in death rates from cancer was partic- ularly wide in Korea, Spain, the Slovak Republic, Japan and France, with mortality rates among men more than twice as high as for women. The gender gap incancer mortality rates can be explained partly by the greater prevalence of ri sk factors among men, as well as the lesser availability or use of screening programmes for different types of cancers affecting men, leading to lower survival rates after diagnosis. Lung cancer still accounts for the greatest number of cancer deaths among men in all OECD countries (except Mexico and Sweden), while it is also one of the main causes of cancer mortality among women. Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. In 2006, death rates from lung canceramong men were the highes t in central and eastern European countries (Hungary, Poland, the Slovak andCzech Republics), the Netherlands, Greece and Korea (Figure 1.5.2). These are all countries where smoking rates among men are relatively high. Death rates from lung cancer among men are low in Mexico, and in Sweden, one of the countries with the lowest smoking rate among men (see Indicator 2.5 \"Tobacco consumption\"). Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in all OECD countries (IARC, 2004). It accounts for 30% or more of cancer incidence among women, and 15% to 20% of cancer deaths. While there has been an increase in measured incidence rates of breast cancer over the past decade, death rates have declined or remained stable, indicating increases in survival rates due to earlier diagnosis and/or better treatments (see Indicator 5.8 \"Screening, survival and mortality for breast cancer\"). The lowest mortality rates from breast cancer are in Korea and Japan, while the highest mortality rates are in Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.5.3).Prostate cancer has become the most commonly occurring cancer among men in many OECD coun- tries, particularly for those aged over 65 years of age, although death rates from prostate cancer remain lower than for lung cancer in all countries except Mexico and Sweden. The rise in the reported inci- dence of prostate cancer in many countries during the 1990s and 2000s is largely due to the greater use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA ) diagnostic tests. Death rates from prostate cancer in 2006 varied from lows ofless than 10 per 100 000 males in Korea and Japan, to highs of more than 30 per 100 000 males in Denmark, Sweden and Norway (Figure 1.5.4). The causes of pros- tate cancer are not well-understood. Some evidence suggests that environmental and dietary factors might influence the risk of prostate cancer (Instituteof Cancer Research, 2009). Death rates from all types of cancer for males and females have declined at least slightly in most OECD countries since 1985, although the decline has been more modest than for cardio-vascular diseases, explaining why cancer accoun ts now for a larger share of all deaths. The exceptions to this declining patternare Greece, Korea, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic and Spain, where cancer mortality has remained static or increased between 1985 and 2006. Definition and deviations Mortality rates are based on the crude number of deaths according to selected causes in the WHO Mortality Database. Mathers et al. (2005) have provided a general assessment of the coverage,completeness and reliability of WHO data on causes of death. The international comparability of cancer mortality data can be affected by differences in medical training and practices as well as in death certification procedures across countries. Mortality rates have been age- standardised to the 1980 OECD population, to remove variations arising from differences in age structures across countries and over time within each country.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.6. Mortality from road accidents Worldwide, an estimated 1.2 million people are killed in road traffic accidents each year, and as many as 50 million people are injured or disabled (WHO, 2009c). In OECD countries alone, they were respon- sible for more than 125 000 deaths in 2006, occurring most often in the United States (46 000), Mexico (17 000) and Japan (9 000). Around 5 000-6 000 road accident deaths occurred in each of Italy , Poland and Germany in 2006. Mortality from road accidents is the leading cause of death among children and young people, and espe- cially young men, in many countries. The fatality risk for motor cycles and mope ds is highest among all modes of transport, even though most fatal traffic injuries occur in passenger vehicles (ETSC, 2003; Beck et al. , 2007). Besides the adverse social, physical and psychologicaleffects, the direct and indirect financial costs of road traffic accidents are substantial; one estimate put these at 2% of gross national product annually in highly-motorised countries (Peden et al. , 2004). Injury and mortality from road a ccidents remains a serious public health concern. Death rates were the highest in 2006 in Mexico and Portugal, followed by Korea and the United States, all in excess of 15 deaths per 100 000 population (Figure 1.6.1). They were the lowest in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, at five deaths per 100 000 population or less. A four-fold difference exists between the Netherlands and Mexico, the countries with th e lowest and highest rates. Deaths from road accidents are much higher for males than for females in all OECD countries, with disparities in rates ranging from twice as high among males in Iceland to more than four times higher in Greece and Italy. On average, three times as many males thanfemales die in road accidents (Figure 1.6.2). Much road accident injury and mortality is prevent- able. Road security has increased greatly over the past decades in many countries through improvements of road systems, education and prevention campaigns, the adoption of new laws and regulations and theenforcement of these new laws through more trafficcontrols. As a result, death rates due to road accidents have been cut by more than half on a verage in OECD countries since 1970 (Figure 1.6.3). The Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland have seen the largest declines in death rates, with a reduction of about 80% since 1970, although vehicle kilometers travelled have increased by 2.7 times on average in European coun- tries in the same period (OECD/ITF, 2008). Death rates have also declined in the United States, but at a slower pace, and therefore remain above the OECD average. In Mexico and Greece, there have been significant increases in death rates from road accidents since 1970 (Figure 1.6.4). Based on an extrapolation of past trends, projections from the World Bank indicate that between 2000 and 2020, road traffic deaths may decline further by about 30% in high-income countries, but may increase substantially in low- and middle-income countries if no additional road safety counter-measures are put in place (Peden et al. , 2004). Definition and deviations Mortality rates are based on the crude number ofdeaths according to selected causes in the WHO Mortality Database. Mathers et al. (2005) have provided a general assessment of the coverage,completeness and reliability of WHO data on causes of death. Mortality rates have been age- standardised to the 1980 OECD population, to remove variations arising from differences in age structures across countries and over time within each country. Mortality rates from road traffic accidents in Luxembourg are biased upward because of the large volume of traffic in transit, resulting in a significant proportion of non-residents killed.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.7. Suicide The intentional killing of oneself is evidence not only of personal breakdown, but also of a deterioration of the social context in which an individual lives. Suicidemay be the end-point of a number of different contrib- uting factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indi cator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of sui-cides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see \"Definition and deviations\"). Suicide is a significant cause of death in many OECD countries, and there were 140 000 such deaths in 2006. In 2006, there were fewest suicides in southern European countries (Greece, Italy and Spain) and in Mexico and the United Kingdom, at less than seven deaths per 100 000 population (Figure 1.7.1). They were highest in Korea, Hungary, Japan and Finland, at 18 or more deaths per 100 000 population. There is more than a seven-fold difference between Korea and Greece, the countries with the lowest and high death rates. Since 1990, suicide rates have decreased in many OECD countries, with pronounced declines of 40% or more in Denmark, Luxembourg and Hungary (Figure 1.7.3). Despite this progress, Hungary still has one of the highest rates among OECD countries. On the other hand, death rates from suicides have increased the most since 1990 in Korea, Mexico and Japan, although in Mexico rates remain at low levels. In Korea and Japan, suicide rates now stand well above the OECD average (Figure 1.7.4). Male suicide rates in Korea almost tripled from 12 per 100 000 in 1990 to 32 in 2006, and suicide rates among women are the highest among OECD countries, at 13 per 100 000. Economic downturn, weakening social integration and the erosion of the traditional family support base for the elderly have all been implicated in Korea's recent increase in suicide rates (Kwon et al. , 2009). In general, death rates from suicides are three to fourtimes greater for men than for women across OECD countries (Figure 1.7.2), and this gender gap has been fairly stable over time. The gender gap is narrower for attempted suicides, reflecting the fact that women tend to use less fatal methods than men.Suicide is also related to age, with young people aged under 25 and elderly people especially at risk. While suicide rates among the latter have generally declined over the past two decades, almost no progress has been observed among younger people. Since suicides are, in the va st majority of cases, linked with depression and alcohol and other substance abuse, the early detection of these psycho-social prob- lems in high-risk groups by families, social workers and health professionals mu st be part of suicide prevention campaigns, together with the provision ofeffective support and treatm ent. With suicide receiv- ing increasing attention worldwide, many countriesare promoting mental health and developing nationalstrategies for prevention, focussing on at-risk groups (Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009). In Finland and Iceland, suicide prevention programmes have been based on efforts to promote strong multisectoral collaboration and networking (NOMESCO, 2007). Definition and deviations The World Health Organisation defines \"suicide\"as an act deliberately initiated and performed by a person in the full knowledge or expectation of its fatal outcome. Mortality rates are based on the crude number of deaths according to selected causes in the WHO Mortality Database. Mathers et al. (2005) have provided a general assessment of the coverage,completeness and reliability of WHO data on causes of death. Mortality rates have been age- standardised to the 1980 OECD population, to remove variations arising from differences in age structures across countries and over time within each country. Comparability of suicide data between countries is affected by a number of reporting criteria, including how a person's intention of killing themselves is ascertained, who is responsible for completing the death certificate, whether a forensic investigation is carried out, and the pro- visions for confidentiality of the cause of death. Caution is required therefore in interpreting variations across countries.1. HEALTH STATUS HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 291.7.

HEALTH STATUS 1.8. Infant mortality Infant mortality, the rate at which babies of less than one year of age die, reflects the effect of economic and social conditions on the health of mothers and new- borns as well as the effectiveness of health systems. In 2007, infant mortality rates in OECD countries ranged from a low of two to three deaths per 1 000 live births in Japan, Nordic countries (with the exception of Denmark), Ireland and Luxembourg, up to a high of 16 and 21 deaths per 1 000 live births in Mexico and Turkey respectively (Figure 1.8.1). Infant mortality rates were also relatively high (six or more deaths per 1 000 live births) in the United States and in some eastern and central European countries. Excluding Turkey and Mexico, the average across the remaining28 OECD countries was 3.9 in 2007. Around two-thirds of the de aths that occur during the first year of life are neonatal deaths ( i.e. during the first four weeks). Birth defects, prematurity and other conditions arising during pregnancy are the principal factors contributing to ne onatal mortality in devel- oped countries. With an in creasing number of women deferring childbearing and the rise in multiple births linked with fertility treatments, the number of pre- term births has tended to increase (see Indicator 1.9 \"Infant health: low birth weight\"). In a number of higher-income countries, this has contributed to a leveling-off of the downward trend in infant mortality rates over the past few years. The increase in the birth of very small infants was the main reason for the first increase since the 1950s in infant mortality rates in the United States between 2001 and 2002. For deathsbeyond a month (post neonatal mortality), there tends to be a greater range of causes - the most common being SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), birth defects, infections and accidents. All OECD countries have achieved remarkable progress in reducing infant mortality rates from the levels of 1970, when the average was approaching 30 deaths per 1 000 live births (Figure 1.8.3). This equates to a cumulative reduction of over 80% since 1970. Portugal has seen its infant mortality rate reduced by more than 7% per year on average since 1970, going from the country with the highest rate in Europe to an infant mortality rate among the lowest in the OECD in 2007 (Figure 1.8.2). Large reductions in infant mortality rateshave also been observed in Korea and Luxembourg. Onthe other hand, the reduction in infant mortality rates has been slower in the Netherlands and the United States. Infant mortality rate s in the United States used to be well below the OECD average (and median), butthey are now above average (Figure 1.8.3). Numerous studies have used infant mortality rates as a health outcome to examine the effect of a variety of medical and non-medical determinants of health (e.g.Joumard et al. , 2008). Although most analyses show an overall negative relationship between infantmortality and health spending, the fact that some countries with a high level of health expenditure do not necessarily exhibit low levels of infant mortality,has led some researchers to conclude that more health spending is not necessarily required to obtain better results (Retzlaff-Roberts et al. , 2004). A body of research also suggests that many factors beyond thequality and efficiency of the health system, such as income inequality, the social environment, andindividual lifestyles and attitudes, influence infant mortality rates (Kiely et al. , 1995). Definition and deviations The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age in a given year, expressed per 1 000 live births. Neo- natal mortality refers to the death of children under 28 days. Some of the international variation in infant and neonatal mortality rates may be due to varia- tions among countries in registering practices of premature infants. Most countries have no gestational age or weight limits for mortality registration. Minimal limits exist for Norway (to be counted as a death following a live birth, thegestational age must exceed 12 weeks) and in the Czech Republic, Fran ce, the Netherlands and Poland a minimum gestational age of 22 weeksand/or a weight threshold of 500 g is applied.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.9. Infant health: low birth weight Low birth weight - defined here as newborns weigh- ing less than 2 500 grams - is an important indicator of infant health because of the close relationship between birth weight an d infant morbidity and mortality. There are two categories of low birth weightbabies: those occurring as a result of restricted foetal growth and those resulting from pre-term birth. Low birth weight infants have a greater risk of poor health or death, require a longer period of hospitalisation after birth, and are more likely to develop significant disabilities (UNICEF and WHO, 2004). Risk factors for low birth weight include be ing an adolescent mother, having a previous history of low weight births, harm-ful behaviours such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and poor nutrition, a low Body Mass Index, a background of low parental socio-economicstatus or minority race, as well as having in-vitro fertilisation treatment (IHE, 2008). In 2007, the Nordic countries - including Iceland, Sweden and Finland - reported the smallest propor- tions of low weight births, with less than 4.5% of live births defined as low birth weight. Turkey, Japan,Greece, the United States and Hungary are at the other end of the scale, with rates of low birth weight infants above 8% (Figure 1.9.1). These figures comparewith an overall OECD average of 6.8%. Since 1980 the prevalence of low birth weight infants has increased in a number of OECD countries (Figure 1.9.2). There may be several reasons for this rise. First, the number of multiple births, with the increased risks of pre-te rm births and low birth weight, has risen steadily, partly as a result of the risein fertility treatments. Other factors which may have influenced the rise in low birth weight are older age at childbearing and increases in the use of delivery man- agement techniques such as induction of labour and caesarean delivery. Japan, Portugal and Spain, historically among a group of countries with a low proportion of low birth weight, have seen great increases in the past 25 years. As a result, the proportion of low birth weight babiesin these countries is now above the OECD average (Figure 1.9.3). In the case of Japan, a number of risk factors have been cited as contributing to this increase, including the rising prevalence in smoking among younger women from the 1970s onwards together with a significant move towards latermotherhood (Ohmi et al., 2001). Despite the increase in low birth weight babies, Japanese medical care for newborns has been particularly successful in reducing infant mortality. Figure 1.9.4 shows some correlation between the percentage of low birth weight infants and infant mortality rates. In general, countries reporting a low proportion of low birth weight infants also report relatively low infant mortality rates. This is the case for instance for the Nordic countries. Japan, however, is an exception, reporting the highest proportion of low birth weight infants but one of the lowest infant mortality rates. Comparisons of different population groups within countries show that the proportion of low birth weight infants is also be influenced by differences in education, income and associated living conditions. In the United States, marked differences between groups in the proportion of low birth weight infants have been observed, with black infants having a rate almost double that of white infants (CDC, 2009a). Similar differences have also been observed among the indigenous and non-indigenous populations in Australia (Laws and Hilder, 2008) and Mexico, reflecting the disadvantaged living conditions of many of these mothers. Definition and deviations Low birth weight is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the weight of an infant at birth of less than 2 500 grams (5.5 pounds) irre- spective of the gestational age of the infant. This is based on epidemiological observations regard- ing the increased risk of death to the infant and serves for international comparative healthstatistics. The number of low weight births is then expressed as a percentage of total live births. The majority of the data comes from birth regis- ters, however for Mexico the source is a national health interview survey. A small number of countries supply data for selected regions or hospital sectors only.1. HEALTH STATUS HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 331.9.

HEALTH STATUS 1.10. Dental health among children Dental problems, mostly in the form of caries (tooth decay) and gum disease, are common in developed countries, affecting 60-90% of school children and the vast majority of adults (WHO, 2003). People with poor oral health may experience pain and discomfort, func- tional impairment, low self-esteem and dissatisfaction with their appearance. Dental and other oral diseases thus represent a major pub lic health problem. Dental diseases are highly related to lifestyle factors, whichinclude a high sugar diet, while also reflecting whether or not protective measures such as exposure to fluoride and good oral hygiene are present. Much of the burden of dental disease falls on disadvantaged and socially marginalised populations (WHO, 2003), and children are especially vulnerable. Treatment of dental disease in developed countries is often costly, although manycountries offer free or subsidised dental care for children and adolescents (see also Indicator 6.6 \"Inequalities in dentist consultations\"). In 2006, or the closest available year, 12-year-old chil- dren in Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland had an average of less than one d ecayed, missing or filled permanent tooth (DMFT) (Fig ure 1.10.1). In contrast, children in Poland and Hungary had a DMFT score of three or more. Most OECD countries had a very low to low score of between one and two DMFT for 12-year- old children. The past 25 years have seen substantial falls in the DMFT index across OECD countries, declining from an average 4.7 in 1980, to 2.7 in 1990, and 1.5 in 2006 for a consistent group of countr ies with long time series (Figure 1.10.3). During that period, all but one country(Poland) for which data are available saw declines in DMFT of 50% or more (Figure 1.10.2) - a substantial public health achievement. Almost all OECD countries were able to meet the W orld Health Organisation target of no more than three DMFT by the year 2000 (WHO, 2003). However, there is cause for concern among some countries such as Australia, Austria and the United States, which have seen a slowing of the decline, or even an increase in DMFT in recent years.Reductions in caries and other dental problems were achieved through numerous public health measures such as community water fluoridation, along withchanging living conditions, disease management and improving oral hygiene. Dentistry and oral health is moving towards preventive and minimally invasive care, meaning that national strategies are being inte- grated with broader chronic disease prevention and general health promotion goals, since the risks for each are linked (European Commission, 2008b; Petersen, 2008). The common risk fact or approach has a major benefit in that its focus is on improving health for thewhole population, as well as for high risk groups. Figure 1.10.4 shows little association between the number of DMFT among children and the number of dentists per capita. There are substantial differences in DMFT index scores among countries that have the same number of dentists per capita, indicating that many other factors affect dental health beyond the availability of dentists. Definition and deviations A common measure of dental health is theDMFT index. It describes the amount of dental caries in an individual through calculating the number of decayed (D), missing (M) or filled (F) permanent teeth. The sum of these three figures forms the DMFT index. In this instance, the data are for 12-year-old children. A DMFT index of less than 1.2 is judged to be very low, 1.2-2.6 is low, 2.7-4.4 is moderate, and 4.5 or more is high. Norway provides an MFT index, which does not include decayed teeth. Sweden provides a DFT index, excluding a measure of missing teeth. The average age for New Zealand children may be slightly above 12, since Year 8 school children are surveyed. Data for Belgium and Switzerland are regional.1. HEALTH STATUS HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 351.10.

HEALTH STATUS 1.11. Perceived health status Most OECD countries conduct regular health surveys which allow respondents to report on different aspects of their health. A commonly-asked question relates to self-perceived health status, of the type: \"How is your health in general?\". Despite the subjec- tive nature of this question, indicators of perceived general health have been found to be a good predictor of people's future health care use and mortality (for instance, see Miilunpalo et al. , 1997). For the purpose of international comparisons however, cross-countrydifferences in perceived heal th status are difficult to interpret because responses may be affected by differ- ences in the formulation of survey questions and responses, and by cultural factors. Keeping these limitations in mind, in half of the 30 OECD countries, three-quarters or more of the adult population rate their health to be good or very good or excellent (Figure 1.11.1). New Zealand, Canadaand the United States ar e the three countries that have the highest percentage of people assessing their health to be good or very good, with about nine out of ten people reporting to be in good health. But the response categories offered to survey respondents in these three countries are different from those used in European countries and in OECD Asian countries, which introduces an upward bias in the results (see box on \"Definition and deviations\" below). In Spain and Finland, about two-thirds of the adult population rate their health to be good or very good. At the lower end of the scale, less than half of theadult population in Japa n, the Slovak Republic, Portugal, Hungary and Korea rate their health to begood or very good. Focusing on within-country differences, in the major- ity of countries, men are more likely than women to rate their health as good or better, and especially so in Hungary, Korea, Portugal, Spain and Turkey (Figure 1.11.2). Only in Australia, New Zealand and Finland do women rate their health as good or better more often. Unsurprisingly, people's rating of theirown health tends to decline with age. In many coun- tries, there is a particularly marked decline in a positive rating of one's own health after age 45 and a further decline after age 65. People with a lower level of education or income do not rate their health as positively as people with higher levels in all OECD countries (Mackenbach et al. , 2008). The percentage of the adult population rating theirhealth as being good or very good has remained reasonably stable over the past 25 years in mostcountries where long time series are available, although some, such as Japan, have shown variation (Figure 1.11.3). The same is generally true for the popu- lation aged 65 and over. One possible interpretation of the relative stability of the indicator of perceived gen- eral health may be related to how it is measured - that is, based on a bounded variable ( i.e. respondents are asked to rank their health on a five-point scale that isunchanged over time), whereas life expectancy is mea- sured without any such limit. Another interpretation may be that people in these countries are living longer now, but possibly not healthier. Definition and deviations Perceived health status reflects people's overallperception of their heal th, and may reflect all physical and psychological dimensions. T ypi-cally, survey respondents are asked a question such as: \"How is your health in general? V ery good, good, fair, poor, very poor\". OECD Health Data provides figures related to the proportion of people rating their health to be \"good/very good\" combined. Caution is required in making cross-country comparisons of perceived health status, for at least two reasons. First, people's assessment of their health is subjective and can be affected by factors such as cultural background and national traits. Second, there are variations in the question and answer categories used to measure perceived health across surveys/countries. In particular, the response scale used in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia is asymmetric (skewed on the positive side), including the followingresponse categories: \"excellent, very good, good, fair, poor\". The data reported in OECD Health Data refer to respondents answering one of the threepositive responses (\"excellent, very good or good\"). By contrast, in most other OECD coun- tries, the response scale is symmetric , with response categories being: \"very good, good, fair,poor, very poor\". The data reported from these countries refer only to the first two categories (\"very good, good\"). Such a difference in response categories biases upward the results from those countries that are using an asymmetric scale.1.

HEALTH STATUS 1.12. Diabetes prevalence and incidence Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease, characterised by high levels of glucose in the blood. It occurs either because the pancreas stops producing the hormone insulin (type 1 diabetes), or through a combination of the pancreas having reduced ability to produce insulin alongside the body being resistant to its action (type 2diabetes). People with diabetes are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke if the di sease is left undiagnosed or poorly controlled. They also have elevated risks forsight loss, foot and leg amputation due to damage to the nerves and blood vessels, and renal failure requir- ing dialysis or transplantation. Diabetes was the principal cause of death of more than 300 000 persons in OE CD countries in 2007, and is the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in mostdeveloped countries. However, only a minority of persons with diabetes die from diseases uniquely related to the condition - in addition, about 50% of persons with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease, and 10-20% of renal failure (IDF, 2006). Diabetes is increasing rapi dly in every part of the world, to the extent that it has now assumed epidemic proportions. Estimates suggest that more than 6% of the population aged 20-79 years in OECD countries, or 83 million people, will have diabetes in 2010. Almost half of diabetic adults are aged less than 60 years. If left unchecked, the number of people with diabetes in OECD countries will reach almost 100 million in less than 20 years (IDF, 2006). Less than 5% of adults aged 20-79 years in Iceland, Norway and the United Ki ngdom will have diabetes in 2010, according to the International Diabetes Federation. This contrasts with Mexico and the United States, where more than 10% of the population of the same age have the disease (Figure 1.12.1). In most OECD countries, between 5 and 9% of the adult population have diabetes. T ype 1 diabetes accounts for only 10-15% of all diabe- tes cases. It is the predominant form of the disease in younger age groups in most developed countries. Based on disease registers and recent studies, the annual number of new cases of type 1 diabetes in children aged under 15 years is high at 25 or more per 100 000 population in Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden and Norway) (Figure 1.12.2). Korea, Mexico, Japan and Turkey have less than five new cases per 100 000 population. Alarmingly, there is evidence that type 1 diabetes is developing at an earlier age among children (IDF, 2006). The economic impact of diabetes is substantial. Health expenditure to treat and prevent diabetes and itscomplications was estimated at USD 212 billion in OECD countries in 2007 (IDF, 2006). In the United Statesalone, some USD 116 billion was spent on care to treat diabetes, along with its complications and excess gen- eral medical costs in 2007 (ADA, 2008). In Australia, direct health care expenditure on diabetes in 2004-05 accounted for nearly 2% of the recurrent health expen- diture (AIHW, 2008d). Around one-quarter of medical expenditure is spent on controlling elevated blood glucose, another quarter on treating long-term compli- cation of diabetes, and the remainder on additional general medical care (IDF, 2006). Increasing costs reinforce the need to provide quality care for themanagement of diabetes and its complications (see Indicator 5.2 \"Avoidable admissions: diabetes complications\"). T ype 2 diabetes is largely preventable. A number of risk factors, such as overweight and obesity and physical inactivity are modifiable, and can also help reduce the complications that are associ ated with diabetes. But in most countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity also continues to increase (see Indicator 2.7 \"Overweight and obesity among adults\"). Definition and deviations The sources and methods used by the Inter- national Diabetes Federation for publishing national prevalence estimates of diabetes are outlined in their Diabetes Atlas, 4th edition (IDF, 2009). Country data were derived from studiespublished between 1980 and February 2009, and were only included if they met several criteria for reliability. Studies from several OECD countries - Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom - only provided self-reporteddata on diabetes. To account for undiagnosed diabetes, the prevalence of diabetes for Canada and the United Kingdom was multiplied by a factor of 1.5, in accordance with findings from the United States (for Canada) and local recom- mendations (for the United Kingdom), and doubled for other countries, based on data from a number of countries. Prevalence rates were adjusted to the World Standard Population to facilitate cross-national comparisons.1. HEALTH STATUS HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 391.12.

HEALTH STATUS 1.13. AIDS incidence The first cases of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were diagnosed almost 30 years ago. The onset of AIDS is normally caused as a result of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection and can manifest itself as any number of different diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, as the immune system is no longer able to defend the body. There is a time lag between HIV infection, AIDS diag- nosis and death due to HIV infection, which can be any number of years depending on the treatment administered. Despite worldwide research, there is no cure currently available. In 2006, the number of reported new cases of AIDS stood at approximately 45 000 across the OECD area asa whole, representing an unweighted average inci- dence rate of 16.2 per million population (Figure 1.13.1). Since the first reporting of AIDS cases in the early 1980s, the number of cases rose rapidly to reach an average of more than 45 new cases per million pop- ulation across OECD countries at its peak in the first half of the 1990s, almost three times current incidence rates (Figure 1.13.2). Public awareness campaigns contributed to steady decl ines in reported cases through the second half of the 1990s. In addition, the development and greater availability of antiretroviral drugs, which reduce or slow down the development of the disease, led to a sharp decrease in incidence between 1996 and 1997. The United States has consistently shown the highest AIDS incidence rates among OECD countries, although it is important to note that the case reporting defini- tions were expanded in 1993 and subsequently differ from the definition used across Europe and other OECD countries. The change in definition also explains the large increase in cases in the United States in 1993 (Figure 1.13.2). In Europe, Spain reported the highestincidence rates in the first decade following the out- break, although there has been a sharp decline since 1994, leaving Portugal currently with the highest rate among European countries. Central European countries such as the Czech and Slovak Republics and Hungary, along with Turkey, Korea and Japan report the lowest incidence rates of AIDS among OECD countries.In the United States, over one million people are cur-rently living with HIV/AIDS, including over 450 000 with AIDS (CDC, 2008). Almost three-quarters of new cases of AIDS diagnosed in 2006 were among men, and racial and ethnic minorities continue to be disproportionately affected by the epidemic. In Canada, Aboriginal people are over-represented. In most OECD countries, the main risk factor for HIV infection remains unprotected sex between men.Approximately 75% of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in western and central Europe is among migrants. In recent years, the overall decline in AIDS cases has slowed down. This reversal has been accompanied byevidence of increasing transmission of HIV in several European countries (ECDC and WHO, 2008), attributed to complacency regarding the effectiveness of treat- ment and a waning of public awareness regarding drug use and sexual practice. Further inroads in AIDS inci- dence rates will require more intensive HIV prevention programmes that are focused and adapted to reach those most at risk of HI V infection (UNAIDS, 2008). Definition and deviations The incidence rate of AIDS is the number of newcases per million population at year of diagnosis. Note that data for recent years are provisional due to reporting delays, which sometimes can be for several years depending on the country. The United States expanded their AIDS sur- veillance case definition in 1993 to include T-lymphocyte count criteria. This broadening of the definition led to a large increase in the number of new cases in the United States in 1993 and explains some of the current variations inAIDS incidence between the United States and other OECD countries.1.

Smoking and alcohol consumption at age 15 Regular smoking or excessive drinking in adolescence has immediate and long-ter m health consequences. Children who establish smoking habits in early ado-lescence increase their risk of cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses and cancer. They are also morelikely to experiment with alcohol and other drugs. Alcohol misuse is itself associated with a range of social, physical and mental health problems, includ- ing depressive and anxiety disorders, obesity andaccidental injury (Currie et al. , 2008). Results from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys, a series of collaborative cross-national studies cond ucted in most OECD coun- tries, allow for monitoring of smoking and drinking behaviours among adolescents. Generally, today girls smoke more than boys, but more boys get drunk. Between 13 and 15 years of age, the prevalence of smoking and drunkenness doubles in many OECD countries. Children in Austria, Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Italy smoke more often, with weekly rates of 20% or more for both boys and girls (Figure 2.1.1). In contrast, 10% or less of 15-year-olds in the United States, Canada and Sweden smoke weekly. Most countries report higher rates of smoking for girls, although only Spain and Austria have differ- ences in excess of 5%. Greece, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Poland and the Slovak Republic are the only countries where smoking is more prevalent among boys. Drunkenness at least twice in their lifetime is reported by 40% or more of 15-year-olds in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Finland (F igure 2.1.2). Across all surveyed countries, 29% of girls and 33% of boys havebeen drunk on two or more occasions, with much lower rates in the United States, and Mediterranean coun- tries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal. Boys are more likely to report repeated drunkenness. Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary and the Slovak Republic have the biggest differences, with rates of alcohol abuse being 5-10% higher than those of girls. In Poland, differences are even greater, with repeated drunkenness among boys being over 10% higher than girls. Norway, Spain, Canada and the United Kingdom are the only countries where more girls report repeated drunkenness, and in each case rates are less than 5% higher. The differences in recent smoking and drinking rates between 15-year-old boys and girls are shown in Figure 2.1.3. Countries above the 45 degree line havehigher rates for girls, and countries below the linehigher rates for boys. Countries with higher rates of smoking among boys also report higher rates for girls, with the same finding for drinking rates. Rates of drunkenness are also available for 13-year-olds (Currie et al. , 2008). At this age, over one in ten children in the United Kingdom, Finland, Canada and theSlovak Republic have experienced drunkenness more than twice. In Poland and Hungary, high rates of repeated drunkenness at 13 are also seen for boys. The largest relative increase in reported drunkenness between the ages of 13 and 15 are seen in Norway, Iceland and Sweden, but the rate in each of thesecountries remains below average at age 15. Risk-taking behaviours among adolescents are falling, with both alcohol and cigarette consumption among 15-year-olds showing some decline from the levels of the late 1990s (Figure 2.1.4). With the exception of Greece, all surveyed OECD countries report falling rates of smoking for both boys and girls. Levels of smoking for both sexes are at their lowest for a decade with, on average, fewer than one in five children of either sex smoking regularly. Some country conver- gence in risk behaviours is also evident: among girls for smoking, and dr unkenness for both boys and girls. Definition and deviations Estimates for smoking refer to the proportion of15-year-old children who self-report smoking at least once a week. Estimates for drunkenness record the proportions of 13- and 15-year-old children saying they have been drunk more than twice in their lives. Data for 24 OECD countries are from Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) sur- veys undertaken between 1992-93 and 2005-06. Data are drawn from school-based samples. France, Germany and the United Kingdom report results for certain regions only. The survey has not been carried out in Australia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand. Turkey is included in the 2005-06 HBSC survey, but did not question children on drinking and smoking.2.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.2. Nutrition at ages 11, 13 and 15 Nutrition is important for children's development and long-term health. Eating fruit during adolescence, for example, in place of high-fat, sugar and salt products, can protect against health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart problems. Moreover, eating fruit when young can be habit fo rming, promoting healthy eating behaviours for later life. A number of factors influe nce the amount of fruit consumed by adolescents, including family income, the cost of alternatives, preparation time, whether parents eat fruit, and the availability of fresh fruit which can be linked to the country or local climate (Rasmussen et al. , 2006). Low family affluence is asso- ciated with lower fruit consumption in most OECD countries. Fruit (and vegetable) consumption have a high priority as indicators of healthy eating in most OECD countries. In 2005-06, only around one-third of boys and two- fifths of girls aged 11-15 years ate at least one piece of fruit daily, according to the latest Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey (Currie et al. , 2008). Overall, boys in Italy, and girls in the United Kingdomhad the highest rates of dail y fruit consumption. Fruit consumption is relatively low among some Nordiccountries, including Finl and, Iceland and Sweden. Finnish children reported the lowest levels of daily fruitconsumption, with rates lower than one in four girls and one in five boys. Girls at all ages in most countries were more likely to eat fruit daily . At age 11, girls in Norway, Portugal and Switzerland, as well as boys in Portugal, the United States and Italy were more likely to eat fruit daily. By age 15, girls in Italy, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and boys in Italy, Portugal and Belgium ate most (Figure 2.2.1). In almost all OECD countrie s, daily fruit consumption falls between ages 11 and 15 (Figure 2.2.2). Amonggirls, the OECD average fell from 46% at age 11, to 40% at age 13 and 36% at age 15. For boys, the fall was from 38% to 33% and then 26%. In Austria and Iceland, rates fell by up to half between ages 11 and 15, and severe falls were also seen in Hungary (girls). Italy (girls), as well as Belgium (boys) are the most successful coun-tries in maintaining healthy eating habits as children get older. The gap between the fruit consumption of boys and girls is largest at age 15, for most countries. At age 11, France, Italy and Spain are most equal in terms of fruit eating by sex. Norway, Germany and Poland have the biggest gaps at this age. As children reach age 15, gaps in Denmark, the Czech Republic and Turkey grow to a level where fewer than six boys for every ten girls eat fruit regularly. Average reported rates of daily fruit consumption across OECD countries showed some increase between 2001-02 and 2005-06. This was most evident among girls aged 11 (Figure 2.2.3). Effective strategies are required in order to ensure that children are eating enough fruit to conform with recommended dietary guidelines. Children generally hold a positive attitude toward fruit intake, and report good availability of fruit at home, but lower availa- bility at school and during leisure time. Increased accessibility to fruit, comb ined with educational and motivational activities, can help in increasing fruitconsumption (Sandvik et al. , 2005). Definition and deviations Nutrition is measured in terms of the propor- tions of children who report eating fruit at least every day or more than once a day. In addition to fruit, healthy nutrition also involves other types of foods. Data for 25 OECD countries are from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys undertaken in 2001-02 and 2005-06. Data are drawn from school-based samples. France, Germany and the United Kingdom report results for certain regions only. The survey has not been carried out in Australia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand.2.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.3. Physical activity at ages 11, 13 and 15 Undertaking physical activity in adolescence is beneficial for health, and can set standards for adult physical activity levels, thereby indirectly influencinghealth outcomes in later life. Research supports the role that physical activity in adolescence has in theprevention and treatment of a range of youth health issues including asthma, me ntal health, bone health and obesity. More direct links to adult health arefound between physical activity in adolescence and its effect on overweight and obesity and related diseases, breast cancer rates and bone health in later life. The health effects of adolescent physical activity are largely dependent on the activity type, e.g. water physical activities in adolescence are effective in the treatment of asthma, and exercise is recommended in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (Hallal et al. , 2006; Currie et al. , 2008). Some of the factors influencing the levels of physicalactivity undertaken by adolescents include the avail- ability of space and equipment, the child's present health conditions, their school curricula and other competing pastimes. One in five children in OECD countries undertake moderate-to-vigorous exercise regularly, according to results from the 2005-06 HBSC survey (Figure 2.3.1). Children in Switzerland and France are least likely to exercise regularly, whereas the Slovak Republic and Ireland stand out as strong performers with over 40 and 30% respectively of children aged 11 to 15 exercis- ing for a total of at least 60 minutes per day over the past week. The country rankings reported vary according to the child's age. France appears at the lower end, especially for girls, at all ages. There is very little change in the rates of exercise among boys in the United States at ages 11, 13 and 15, with one in three children meeting the recommended guidelinesthroughout all ages. Boys consistently undertake more physical activity than girls, across all countries and all age groups. It is of concern that physical activity tends to fall between ages 11 to 15 for most OECD countries (Figure 2.3.2), with boys in the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and the United States the only excep- tions. In Portugal, Norway, Sweden, Austria, and Finland, the rates of exercising among boys more than halve between ages 11 and 15. The rates of girls exercising to recommended levels also falls betweenthe ages of 11 and 15 years. In the Czech Republic,Luxembourg, Belgium, and Switzerland, rates for 15-year-old girls fall to as little as one-fifth of those reported at age 11. Similarly, in Iceland, Ireland and Finland, rates of physical activity among girls fall by over 60%. To compare levels of exercise between 2001-02 and 2005-06, results are reported in relation to the OECD average (Figure 2.3.3). In 2001-02, rates refer to children reporting an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise five days a week, but in 2005-06 figures refer to exercise of this type seven days a week. Boys' rates were above the OECD average in the Netherlands, Austria, the United Kingdom, Poland and Greecein 2001-02, but fell below the average in 2005-06. Finland, Hungary, and Denmark are countries where rates of physical activity were below the OECD average in 2001-02, but were among the higher performers in 2005-06. For boys, only Ireland, the United States and Canada have been consistently high performers on measures of physical activity in both waves. For girls, Spain and Belgium have moved from below aver- age performances in 2001-02 to above average in 2005-06. In Sweden, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Austria, rates of physical activity among girls have fallen below the OECD average since 2001-02. Definition and deviations Data for physical activity considers the regularityof moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as reported by 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds for theyears 2001-02 and 2005-06. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity refers to exercise undertaken for at least an hour which increases both heart rateand respiration (and leaves the child out of breath sometimes) on five or more days per week in 2001-02, and seven days a week in 2005-06. Indicators are taken from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (HBSC). Data are drawn from school-based samples, but some countries report regional results only. The survey was not carried out in Australia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand.2. NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 492.3.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.4. Overweight and obesity among children Children who are overweight or obese are at greater risk of poor health in adolescence and in adulthood. Being overweight in childhood increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as well as related social and mental health problems. Excess weight problems in childhood are associated with an increased risk of being an obese adult, where certain forms of cancer, osteoarthritis, a reduced quality of lifeand premature death can be added to the list of health concerns (Currie et al. , 2008; WHO Europe, 2007). Evidence suggests that even if excess childhoodweight is lost, adults who were obese children retain an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. And although dieting can combat obesity, children whodiet are at a greater risk of putting on weight following periods of dieting. Eating disorders, symptoms ofstress and postponed physical development can also be products of dieting. Across most OECD countries, one in seven children are overweight or obese (Figure 2.4.1). Aggregate figures for 2005-06 show that nearly one in three chil- dren in the United States, and one in five in Canada, are overweight or obese - the highest rates among surveyed countries in the OECD. Southern European countries such as Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain also have higher rates of children with excess weight problems. Fewer than one in ten children in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Slovak Republic and Denmark are overweight or obese. There is no clear association between weight prob- lems and weight reduction behaviours at the national level. In most countries, the number of children trying to lose weight is greater than the number with excess weight problems. Generally, countries where few chil- dren report excess weight problems also report weight reduction behaviours close to the OECD average. The six countries with the highest rates of overweight and obese children have similar levels of weight reduction behaviour, each around the OECD average of 14%, even though the proportion of children with excess weight problems varies widely. There are important differences among children with excess weight problems, according to their age. In some countries older children have more excess weight than younger children , for others countries the opposite is true (Figure 2.4.2). Countries in the topright hand corner of the fi gure report cohort changes above the OECD average for both boys and girls.A number of countries, including the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Switzerland report increases in overweight and obesity rates for bothboys and girls as children get older. Eight countrieshave below average differences for both boys and girls. The Czech Republic stands out as the only country where rates of excess weight for both boys and girls are lower for the 15-year-old cohorts compared to the 11-year-old cohorts Rates of overweight and obese boys and girls are increasing across the OECD (Figure 2.4.3). Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, every surveyed country reported an increase in overweight or obesity for boys aged 15. The largest increases during the four year period were found in the United States, Portugal and Austria. A similar pattern of increases is seen for girls, with rates in the United States, Portugal and Germany almost doubling. Only Ireland and the United Kingdom reportreductions in the proportion of overweight or obese girls at age 15 between 2001-02 and 2005-06. However, because non-response rates to questions of self- reported height and weight were high in both these countries, cautious interpretation is required. Definition and deviations Estimates of overweight and obesity are based on Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations using child self-reported height and weight. Over- weight and obese children are those whose BMI is above a set of age- and sex-specific cut-off points (Cole et al. , 2000). Data on weight reduc- tion record children who report being on a dietor doing something el se to lose weight. Self-reported height and weight is subject tounder-reporting and error, and requires cautious interpretation. In 2005-06, Canada, England and Norway have missing data for over 30% of res- pondents for 11-year-olds. The same is true forEngland, Ireland and Belgium for 13-years-olds, and in England and Ireland for 15-year-olds.In 2001-02, BMI data are missing for over 30% of respondents in Ireland. Indicators are taken from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Surveys in 2001-02 and 2005-06. Aggregate country estimates are crude rates of overweight and obese 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds in each country. Some countries report regional data only. Data are drawn from school-based samples. The survey was not carried out in Australia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand.2. NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 512.4.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.5. Tobacco consumption among adults Tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world, after cardiovascular disease, and is directly responsible for about one in ten adult deaths worldwide, equating to about 6 million deaths each year (Shafey et al. , 2009). It is a major risk factor for at least two of the leading causesof premature mortality - circulatory diseases and a range of cancers. In addition , it is an important contrib- utory factor for respiratory diseases, while smokingamong pregnant women can lead to low birth weight and illnesses among infants. It remains the largest avoidable risk to health in OECD countries. The proportion of daily smokers among the adult pop- ulation varies greatly across countries, even between neighboring countries (Figure 2.5.1). In 2007, rateswere lowest in Sweden, th e United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Iceland and Portugal, all atless than 20% of the adult population smoking daily. On average, smoking rates have decreased by about 5 percentage points in OECD countries since 1995, with a higher decline in men than in women. Large declines occurred in Turkey (47% to 33%), Luxembourg (33% to 21%), Norway to 26%) and Denmark (36% to 25%). Greece maintains the highest level of smoking, along with Turkey and Hungary, with 30% or more of the adult population smoking daily. Greece and Mexico are the only OECD countries where smoking appears to be increasing in both men and women. In the post-war period, mo st OECD countries tended to follow a general pattern marked by very high smoking rates among men (50% or more) through to the 1960s and 1970s, while the 1980s and the 1990s were characterised by a marked downturn in tobacco consumption. Much of this decline can be attributed to policies aimed at redu cing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertisingbans and increased taxation, in response to rising rates of tobacco-related di seases (World Bank, 1999). In addition to government policies, actions by anti-smoking interest groups were very effective in reduc- ing smoking rates by changing beliefs about the health effects of smoking, particularly in North America (Cutler and Glaeser, 2006). Although large disparities remain, smoking rates across most OECD countries have shown a marked decline over recent decades (Figure 2.5.3). Smoking prevalence among men continues to be higher than among women in all OECD countries except Swedenand Norway. Female smoking rates continue to decline in most OECD countries, and in a number of cases (Turkey, New Zealand, Iceland, Canada, United States, United Kingdom and Ireland) at an even faster pace than male rates. Only in five countries do female smoking rates appear to have been increasing over the last 12 years (Austria, Germany, Greece, Mexico and Portugal), but in these countries women are still less likely to smoke than men. In 2007, the gender gap in smoking rates was particularly large in Korea, Japanand Turkey and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico, Portugal, Greece and Poland (Figure 2.5.2). Several studies provide strong evidence of socio- economic differences in smoking and mortality(Mackenbach et al. , 2008). People in lower social groups have a greater prevalence and intensity ofsmoking, a higher all-cause mortality rate and lower rates of cancer survival (Woods et al. , 2006). The influ- ence of smoking as a determinant of overall healthinequalities is such that , in a non-smoking popula- tion, mortality differences between social groupswould be halved (Jha et al. , 2006). Figure 2.5.4 shows the correlation between tobaccoconsumption (as measured by grams per capita) and incidence of lung cancer across OECD countries, with a time lag of two decades. Higher tobacco consump- tion at the national level is also generally associatedwith higher mortality rates from lung cancer one or two decades later across OECD countries. Definition and deviations The proportion of daily smokers is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over reporting smoking every day. International comparability is limited due to the lack of standardisation in the measurement ofsmoking habits in health interview surveys across OECD countries. Va riations remain in the wording of questions, response categories andsurvey methodologies, e.g. in a number of coun- tries, respondents are asked if they smoke regu-larly, rather than daily.2.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.6. Alcohol consumption among adults The global health burden re lated to excessive alcohol consumption, both in terms of morbidity and mortal- ity, is considerable in most parts of the world (Rehm et al. , 2009; WHO, 2004b). It is associated with numer- ous harmful health and soci al consequences, includ- ing drunkenness and alcohol dependence. High alcohol intake increases the risk for heart, stroke and vascular diseases, as well as liver cirrhosis and certain cancers. Foetal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of birth defects and intellec tual impairments. Alcohol also contributes to death an d disability through acci- dents and injuries, assault, violence, homicide and suicide, and is estimated to cause more than 2 million deaths annually. It is, however, one of the major avoidable risk factors for disease. Alcohol consumption, as measured by annual sales, stands on average across OECD countries at 9.7 litres per adult, using the most recent data available. Leaving aside Luxembourg - given the high volume of purchases by non-residents in that country - Ireland, Hungary and France reported the highest consump- tion of alcohol, with 13.0 li tres or more per adult per year in 2006-07. At the other end of the scale, Turkey,Mexico and some of the Nordic countries (Norwa y and Sweden) have relatively low levels of alcohol consumption, ranging from one to seven litres per adult (Figure 2.6.1). Although average alcohol consumption has gradually fallen in many OECD countries over the past two decades, it has risen in some others (Figure 2.6.2). There has been a degree of convergence in drinking habits across the OECD, with wine consumption increasing in many traditional beer-drinking countries and vice versa. The traditional wine-producing countries of Italy, Franceand Spain, as well as the Slovak Republic and Greece, have seen their alcohol consumption per capita drop substantially since 1980 (Figures 2.6.2 and 2.6.3). On the other hand, alcohol consumption per capita in Iceland, Ireland and Mexico rose by as much as 40% or more since 1980 although, in the case of Iceland and Mexico, it started from a very low le vel and therefore remains relatively low. Variations in alcohol consumption across countries and over time reflect not only changing drinking habits but also the policy responses to control alcoholuse. Curbs on advertising, sales restrictions and taxa-tion have all proven to be effective measures to reduce alcohol consumption (Bennett, 2003). Strict controls on sales and high taxation are mirrored by overall lower consumption in most Nordic countries, while falls in consumption in France, Italy and Spain may be associated with the voluntary and statutory regula- tion of advertising, partly following a 1989 European directive. Although adult alcohol consumption per capita gives useful evidence of long-term trends, it does not iden- tify sub-populations at risk from harmful drinking patterns. The consumption of large quantities of alcohol at a single session, termed \"binge drinking\", isa particularly dangerous pattern of consumption (Institute of Alcohol Studie s, 2007), which is on the rise in some countries an d social groups, especially among young males (see Indicator 2.1 \"Smoking and alcohol consumption at age 15\"). Figure 2.6.4 shows the relationship between alcohol consumption in 1990 and deaths from liver cirrhosis in 2006. In general, countries with high levels of alco- hol consumption tend to experience higher death rates from liver cirrhosis 10 to 15 years later compared with countries with lower levels of consumption. In most OECD countries, death rates from liver cirrhosis have fallen over the past two decades, following quite closely the overall reduction in alcohol consumption. Definition and deviations Alcohol consumption is defined as annual sales ofpure alcohol in litres per person aged 15 years and over. The methodology to convert alcohol drinks to pure alcohol may differ across countries. Italy reports consumption for the population 14 years and over, Sweden for 16 years and over, and Japan 20 years and over. In some countries (e.g. Luxembourg), national sales do not accurately reflect actual consumption by residents, since pur-chases by non-residents may create a significant gap between national sales and consumption.2.

NON-MEDICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH 2.7. Overweight and obesity among adults The growth in overweight and obesity rates among adults is a major public health concern. Obesity is a known risk factor for numerous health problems, including hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, car- diovascular diseases, respiratory problems (asthma), musculoskeletal diseases (arthritis) and some forms of cancer. Half or more of the adult population is now defined as being either overweight or obese in no less than 13 OECD countries: Mexico, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Greece, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Hungary, Czech Republic, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Iceland. In contrast, overweight and obesity rates are much lower in Japan and Korea and in some Europeancountries (France and Switzerland), although rates are also increasing in these countries. The prevalence of obesity (which presents greater health risks than overweight) varies tenfold among OECD countries, from a low of 3% in Japan and Korea, to over 30% in the United States and Mexico (Figures 2.7.1 and 2.7.2). The rate of obesity has more than doubled over the past 20 years in the United States, while it has almost tripled in Australia and more than tripled in theUnited Kingdom (Figure 2.7.3). Some 20-24% of adults in the United Kingdom, Australia, Iceland and Luxembourg are obese, about the same rate as in the United States in the early 1990s. Obesity rates in many western European countries have increased substan- tially over the past decade. In many countries, the rise in obesity has affected all population groups, regardless of sex, age, race, income or education level. Evidence from nine OECD coun- tries (Australia, Austria, Canada, England, France, Italy, Korea, Spain and the United States) indicates that obesity tends to be more common among indi- viduals in disadvantaged socio-economic groups, particularly among women (Sassi et al., 2009b). Also, an examination of four OECD countries (Australia,Canada, England and Korea) shows a broadly linear relationship between the number of years spent in full-time education and obesity, with the most edu- cated individuals displaying lower rates. Again, the gradient in obesity is stronger in women than in men(Sassi et al. , 2009a). Because obesity is associated with higher risks ofchronic illnesses, it is linked to significant additional health care costs. It has b een estimated that health care costs which might be attributed to obesity accounted forabout 5-7% of total health sp ending in the United States in the late 1990s, and to 3.5% of health spending in othercountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand(Thompson and Wolf, 2001). There is a time lag between the onset of obesity and related health problems, suggesting that the rise in obesity over the past two decades will mean higher health care costs in the future. A recent study estimated that total costs linked to overweight and obesity in England in 2015 could increase by as much as 70% relative to 2007 and could be 2.4 times higher in 2025 (Foresight, 2007). A number of behavioural and environmental factors have contributed to the rise in overweight and obesity rates in industrialised countries, including falling real prices of food and more time spent being physically inactive. Overweight and obesity has risen rapidly in children in recent decades, reaching double-figure rates in most OECD countr ies (see also Indicator 2.4 \"Overweight and obesity among children\"). Definition and deviations Overweight and obesity are defined as excessive weight presenting health risks because of the high proportion of body fat. The most frequentlyused measure is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a single number that evaluates an individual's weight in relation to height (weight/ height 2, with weight in kilograms and height in metres). Based on the WHO classification (WHO,2000), adults with a BMI between 25 and 30 are defined as overweight, and those with a BMI over 30 as obese. This classification may not be suitable for all ethnic groups, who may have equivalent levels of risk at lower or higher BMI. The thresholds for adults are not suitable to mea-sure overweight and obesity among children. For most countries, overweight and obesity rates are self-reported through estimates of height and weight from population-based health inter- view surveys. The exceptions are Australia, Czech Republic (2005), Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, the Slovak Republic (2007), the United Kingdom and the United States, where estimates are derived from health examinations. These differences limit data comparability. Estimates from health examinations are gener- ally higher and more reliable than from health interviews.2.

HEALTH WORKFORCE Introduction The performance of health syst ems in terms of access and qual ity depends crucially on the size, composition, distribution and productivity of the health workforce. Health workers are the cornerstone of health systems, and many OECD countries are reviewing their health human resource strategies to ensure a sufficient number of health care providers, with the right skills and in the right settings, to respond to the demand for high-quality health services. This chapter provides the most recent data on the supply of health workers in OECD countries, along with some of the factors affecting the size and composition of the health workforce. It begins by providing a general overvi ew of trends in employment in the health and social sectors, showing that th ese sectors account for a growing share of total employment in nearly all OECD countries. The rest of the chapter looks more specifically at certain health professions, with a particular focus on doctors and nurses. The number of people working in the health sector is affected by inflows, which depend mainly on the entry of new graduates in the workforce and the immigration of foreign-trained workers, and by outflows, including retirement, emigration to other countries and temporary or permanent exits from the profession (Figure 3.1). The two main methods of increasing the supply of doctors, nurses and other health professionals, as shown in Figure 3.1, are to increase domestic training or to recruit themabroad. These two methods have, however, quite different characteristic s in terms of dynamics and impacts because of the long education and trai ning periods, particularly for doctors. While foreign-trained doctors may be able to respond relatively quickly to any current shortages, it may take about ten years between any policy decision to increase the supply of new doctors and the time that they enter the workforce.3.1 Supply of health workers: inflows, stocks and outflows Source: OECD (2008e).Education Retirement Policies on: Education Pay Working conditions Migration RetirementEmigration of foreign and hometrained Temporary exits from the health workforceImmigration Return to the health workforceHealth workforce3. HEALTH WORKFORCE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 61Introduction This chapter shows that there are large variat ions in the number of practising physicians and nurses across OECD countries. It also presents trends in the number of new graduates from medical and nursing education programmes as a key determinant of current and future supply, as well as trends in the number of fo reign-trained doctors in OECD countries.* Remuneration levels are one of the factor s influencing the attractiveness of health professions, retention rates, and the possible migration of workers to other countries. The income levels of health workers also have a dire ct impact on the overall cost of health systems, since they represent a major expenditure item. Alth ough it is difficult to gather comparable data on the remuneration of different categories of doctors and nurses, the evidence presented in this chapter suggests that there are large variatio ns across countries, either in terms of absolute income levels across countries or compared to the average wage in each country. For doctors, differences in income levels can be attributed partly to the use of different remuneration methods (such as salary, capitation, or fee-for- services), and their impact on activity rates. However, differences in remuneration methods and activity rates do not explain all of thevariations in remuneration levels, suggesting that the income of doctors are also affected by the prices (fees or salaries) that ar e negotiated for their services. This chapter also provides information on the composition of the medical and nursing workforce. It shows that there is a growin g imbalance between general practitioners and specialists in many OECD countrie s, raising issues about access to primary care. It also looks at the supply of certain categories of specialists, such as gynaecologists and obstetricians, andpsychiatrists, taking advantage of the recent extension of the OECD data collection to these specialties. Many OECD countries are reportin g shortages of GPs and specialists in certain regions, typically in rural and remote areas. Chapter 6 on \"Access to care\" provides some information on the uneven distribution of doctors within countries. T wo broad categories of nurses are distinguishe d in this chapter, \"professional nurses\" and \"associate professional nurses\" (who may be designated by different names in different countries). However, nursing aids, whom in some countries represent a very large group of careproviders, are not included in the profile of nurse-related workers. This gap shows that information on the health care workforce continues to be limited in many areas. * Data on the number of foreign-trained nurses around the year 2000 were reported in the 2007 edition of the OECD's International Migration Outlook (see Part III, \"Immigrant Health Workers in OECD Countries in the Broader Context of Highly-Skilled Migration\").HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 623. HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.1. Employment in the health and social sectors The health and social sectors employ a large and growing number of people in OECD countries. The data reported in this section include people working in the health sector along with those working in the social sector (including long-term care, child care and other types of social work). The data include profes- sionals providing direct services to people together with administrative and other support staff. On average across OECD countries, employment in the health and social sectors accounted for nearly 10% of total employment in 2008, up from less than 9% in 1995. The share of people working in the health and social sectors in 2008 is highest in Nordic countries and the Netherlands, accounting for 15% or more oftotal employment. It is the lowest in Turkey and Mexico at about 3% (Figure 3.1.1). The share of people employed in the health and social sectors has increased in nearly all OECD countries between 1995 and 2008, with the exception of Poland where it declined between 2000 and 2003 at a time of slow growth in health spending. In Iceland, Sweden and the Slovak Republic, the share has remained stable. Between 1995 and 2008, the workforce in the health and social sectors grew by 2.8% per year on average across OECD countries, two-times faster than the growth rate of 1.4% in total civilian employment (Figure 3.1.2). In Korea, the number of people working in the health and social sectors increased at an average rate of over 8% per year during that period, compared with a growth rate in total employment of 1.1%. None- theless, the share of empl oyment in the health and social sectors in Korea remains low compared withmost other OECD countries. In Japan, the employment growth rate in the health and social sectors has also exceeded by a wide margin the growth rate in total employment in recent years. In most countries, employment in the health and social sectors continued to increase between 2007 and 2008, at a time when total civilian employment started todecline in some countries as their economy enteredinto recession. This was the case, for instance, in Japan, Spain and the United States, indicating that employ- ment in the health and social sector was less affected by the economic downturn in these countries. How- ever, in other countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Slovak Republic, employment in the health and social sectors fell between 2007 and 2008. The majority of workers in the health sector are health professionals providing direct services to patients. The following indicators provide more detailed information on key health professions, including different categori es of doctors and nurses, dentists and pharmacists. Definition and deviations Employment in the health and social sectors includes people working in the following groups of the International Standard Industrial Classifi- cation (ISIC) Rev. 3: 851 (Human health activities), 852 (Veterinary activities) and 853 (Social work activities). The data are based on head counts, not taking into account whether people are working full-time or part-time. The data for all countries come from Labour Force Surveys to achieve greater comparability. In many countries, more specific surveys of health facilities or heal th professionals can also provide more specific data on employment inthe health sector and for specific occupations. Such data sources are used to provide more detailed information for some of the more specific health occupations presented in the next sections.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.2. Practising physicians In many OECD countries, there are concerns about current or looming shortage s of doctors (OECD, 2008e). This section provides info rmation on the number of doctors per capita in OECD countries, including a disaggregation by gender and by general practitioners and specialists. In 2007, there were highs of four practising doctors or more per 1 000 population in Greece and Belgium, and lows of less than two per 1 000 in Turkey and Korea (Figure 3.2.1). The OECD average was 3.1 per 1 000 population. The ratio of practising physicians per 1 000 population has grown since 1990 in nearly all OECD countries. On average across OECD countries, physician densitygrew at a rate of 2% per year between 1990 and 2007 (Figure 3.2.2). The growth rate was particularly rapid in countries which started with lower levels in 1990 (Turkey, Korea and Mexico) as well as in Spain (since 1995) and Austria. In Austria, graduation rates from medical education programmes have consis- tently been above the OECD average during that period, resulting in high and rising numbers of doctors. On the other hand, the growth rate in the number of physicians per capita was much slower in Canada and France, and it was even negative in Italy. Following the reduction in the number of new entrants in medical schools during the 1980s and 1990s based on the view that there were too many physicians, the number of doctors per capita began to decline in Italy from 2003 and from 2006 in France. This downward trend is expected to continue. In 2007, 40% of doctors on average across OECD coun- tries were women, up from 29% in 1990 (Figure 3.2.3), ranging from highs of more than half in central and eastern European countries (Slovak Republic, Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary) and Finland to lows of less than 20% in Japan. In the United States, the proportion of female doct ors has increased from 20% to 30% between 1990 and 2007, and it should continueto increase in the years ah ead, as women enrolled in medical schools now account for nearly half of allstudents (NCHS, 2009). The balance between general practitioners and special- ists has changed over the past few decades, with the number of specialists increasing much more rapidly than generalists. Although health policy and health research tend to emphasise the importance and cost- effectiveness of generalist primary care (Starfield et al. , 2005), on average across OECD countries, there are nowtwo specialists for every GP. This ratio was one-and-a- half in 1990. Specialists greatly outnumber generalistsin central and eastern European countries and inGreece. On the other hand, some countries have main- tained a more equal balanc e between specialists and generalists (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France,New Zealand and Portugal), although even in some of these countries a vast majority of medical students are now choosing to specialise. Forecasting the future supply and demand of doctors is difficult, because of uncertainties concerning overall economic growth, changes in physician productivity, advances in medical technologies, and the changing roles of physicians versus other care providers. In the United States, the Association of American MedicalColleges has estimated that the demand for physicians might increase by 26% between 2006 and 2025, while the supply might only increase by 10-12%, leading to a growing shortage of physicians (AAMC, 2008). InFrance, recent projections from the French Ministry of Health indicate that the supply of doctors may decline by almost 10% between 2006 and 2020, even taking intoaccount the possible increase in the student intake from 7 000 places in 2006 to 8 000 places from 2011 to 2020 (DREES, 2009). Considering the growth in popu- lation during that period, the doctor-to-population ratio in France is expected to decline sharply, to reach a level of less than 2.8 doctors per 1 000 population in 2020, down from 3.35 in 2007, a decline of over 15% (DREES, 2009). Definition and deviations Practising physicians are defined as the number ofdoctors who are providing care directly to patients. In many countries, the numbers include interns and residents (doctors in training). The numbers are based on head counts, except in Norway which reported full-time equivalents prior to 2002. Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand andPortugal report the number of physicians entitled to practice (resulting in an over-estimation). Datafor Spain include dentists and stomatologists (also resulting in a slight over-estimation). Not all countries are able to report all their practising physicians in the two broad categories of specialists and generalists. This may be due to the fact that specialty-specific data are not available for doctors in training or for those working in private practice.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.3. Medical graduates Maintaining or increasing the number of doctors requires either investment in training new doctors or recruiting trained physicians from abroad (see Indicator 3.4 \"Foreign-trained physicians\"). If it takes about ten years to train a doctor, any current short- ages can be met only by recruiting qualified doctors from abroad, unless there are unemployed doctors at home. Conversely, any surpluses or sudden fall in demand may mean that new graduates, in particular, struggle to find vacant posts at home. Virtually all OECD countries exercise some form of control over medical school intakes, often in the form of a numerus clausus . Such control is motivated by different factors including: i)confining medical entry to the most able applicants; ii)the desire to control the total number of doctors for cost-containment reasons (because greater supply induces greater demand); and iii)the cost of training itself (in all countries, including the United States, a significant part of medical educa-tion costs are publicly funded, so expansion of the number of medical students involves significant public expenditure). A numerus clausus is a policy instrument which countries have used by changingthe cap at different times (OECD, 2008e). Denmark, Austria and Ireland had, in 2007, the highest number of medical graduates per 100 000 population. These countries also tend to have more relaxed policies concerning medical student intakes. On the other hand, the graduation rates were the lowest in France, Japan, Canada and the United States. The average across OECD countries was close to ten new medical graduates per 100 000 population (Figure 3.3.1). Measured in proportion to the stock of physicians (i.e.a measure of the replacement rate), the number of new medical graduates in 2007 was also the highest inDenmark, Austria and Ireland, along with Korea (which still has a relatively low number of doctors per capita). It was the lowest in France, Belgium and Switzerland. The average across OECD countries was 33 medical graduates per 1 000 practising doctors (Figure 3.3.2). In several countries ( e.g. Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom), the number of medical graduates has started to rise strongly since 2000, following stable or declining graduation numbers in the preceding fifteen years, reflecting deliberate changes in policies to train more doctors (Figure 3.3.3). In Japan, the number of medical graduates has remained more or less unchanged over the past two decades. In Italy, France and Germany, there was a marked decline in the number of medical graduates between themid-1980s and the mid-1990s, after which it eithercontinued to fall but a slower rate in the case of France and Germany (with a sign of a possible trend reversal in Germany in 2007) or to generally stabilised in the case of Italy. In France, the numerus clausus was set at a high level (above 8 000 students) when it was first introduced in 1971, but it declined sharply in the late 1970s and 1980s to reach a low of 3 500 in 1992. It then rose to 7 100 by 2007, and consultations are underway to further increase it by 2012. However, given the time it takes to train new doctors, this recent increase in medical school intakes is not expected to be sufficient to maintain the number of doctors per capita inFrance in the coming years, as most doctors are now over 50 years old and expected to retire over the next decade (Cash and Ulmann, 2008). In Japan, which has one of the lowest physician densi- ties in the OECD area, doctor shortages have been discussed for some years an d attributed to limits on the number of medical students (Ebihara, 2007). AnAdvisory Committee to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recently recommended an increase in the country's capacity to train new doctors by 50%, with the aim of increasing the number of doctors per capita from two per 1 000 population to the OECD average of three per 1 000. The intake of medical students has been increased since 2008, but it will take a long time to reach such a target. Definition and deviations Medical graduates are defined as the number ofstudents who have graduated from medical schools or similar institutions in a given year. Dental, public health and epidemiology gradu- ates are excluded. The Czech Republic and the United Kingdom exclude foreign graduates, while other countries include them (foreign graduates account for about 30% of all medical graduates in the Czech Republic). In Denmark, the data refer to the number of new doctors receiving an authori- zation to practice. In Luxembourg, the university does not provide medical training, so all doctors are foreign- trained, most of them in Belgium, France and Germany.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.4. Foreign-trained physicians The international migration of doctors has raised a lot of attention among policy makers during the past decade. In 2007, the percentage of foreign-trained doc- tors ranges from a low of 3.1% in France (although this figure is under-estimated; see \"Definition and devia- tions\" below) to a high of 33.6% in Ireland (Figure 3.4.1).High percentages are also recorded in New Zealand and the United Kingdom where almost a third of all doctors were trained abroad. In Australia and the United States, this percentage is respectively 22.8% (2006) and 25.9%. Differences across countries reflect, to a large extent, differences in migration patterns in general and the migration of highly-skilled workers in particular. The United Kingdom and New Zealand are, however,outliers as in these two countries the share of foreign- born among all tertiary educated workers is much lower than for physicians (OECD, 2008e). The migration of doctors has risen over the past few years in many OECD countr ies. Changes in immigra- tion policies and the development of bridging pro-grammes for the recognition of foreign qualifications have contributed to this ri se, but recent international recruitments have mainly been driven by unmetneeds in host countries. Re cent shortages of doctors are due to stringent measur es on medical education adopted by many OECD countries over the past decades (see Indicator 3.3). Recent efforts to train more doctors should help reverse this trend, although the impact may only be felt in a few years. The percentage of foreign-trained physicians has increased in most OECD countries, sometimes dramatically (Figure 3.4.2). It has nearly doubled inSwitzerland and tripled in Ireland between 2000 and 2007. The increase also exceeded 5 percentagepoints in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Canada is one of the few OECD countries where the share of foreign-trained doctors has decreased since 2000 (Dumont et al. , 2008). The United States is the main receiving country, andhosts about half of all foreign-trained doctors working in the OECD. It is the only country to be a net receiver vis-\u00e0-vis all other OECD countries. In general, the international migration of health workers involvesmultiple interactions between OECD countries. Almost 60% of all migran t doctors in New Zealand were trained in another OECD country. This figure was27% in the United Kingdom, 28% in the United States, 42% in Canada, and 90% in the Netherlands. The composition of migration flows by country of origin depends on a number of factors, including: i)theimportance of migratory ties; ii) language; and iii)recognition of qualifications. Figure 3.4.3 provides an illustration of the distribution of the countries oftraining for the two main OECD receiving countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. It confirms the importance of other OECD countries, but also points out the importance of inflows from large developing countries, notably India and the Philippines. Even if smaller countries lose a small number of doc- tors in absolute term, this may have a large impact on their health system. Previo us OECD work has shown, however, that the needs for health workers in devel-oping countries, as estimated by the WHO, largely outstrip the numbers of immigrant health workers inthe OECD (OECD, 2007a). Thus, it appears that interna- tional migration is neither the main cause nor would its reduction be the solution to the worldwide health human resources crisis, although it exacerbates the problem in some countries. There is growing aware- ness that the health workforc e crisis is a global issue and that developing and developed countries need towork together to address it (OECD and WHO, 2009). Definition and deviations The data relate to registered foreign-trained physicians. In some countries however, the only information available relates to foreign doctors (without information on the location of their training). Some countries only report doctorswith full registration, while others also include those with conditional/temporary/restrictive permits. Because migrant doctors are often over- represented in the latter categories, this may result in a serious undercounting of the number of foreign-trained doctors in those countries where they are not incl uded. This is the case notably for France and to a lesser extent Irelandand Finland. In most countries, the percentage of foreign- trained doctors is calculated by dividing it by the number of registered doctors. This is not the case, however, for France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where the share is calculated based on the number of practising doctors.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.5. Remuneration of doctors (gen eral practitioners and specialists) Remuneration levels are among the factors affecting the attractiveness of different medical professions. They also affect health spending. Gathering compa- rable data on the remunerati on of doctors is difficult, however, because countrie s collect data based on different sources covering di fferent categories of phy- sicians, and often not including all income sources(see the box on \"Definitio n and deviations\" below). Hence, the data should be interpreted with caution. The data on the remuneration of doctors are pre- sented for general practitioners (GPs) and specialists separately, comparing their remuneration with the average wage of all workers in each country. The remuneration of GPs ranges from 1.4 times theaverage wage of all workers in Hungary, to 4.2 times in the United Kingdom (Figure 3.5.1; right panel). The relative income of specialists ranges from 1.5 times the average wage of all workers for salaried specialists in Hungary, to 7.6 times for self-employed specialists in the Netherlands. The remuneration of salaried special- ists in the Netherlands is lower, at 3.5 times the aver- age wage (Figure 3.5.1; left panel). In the United States, the relative income of self-employed specialists was 5.6 times greater than the average wage in the countryin 2001 (latest year available) and 4.1 times greater for salaried specialists. In all countries, the remuneration of GPs is lower thanthat of specialists. The remuneration gap is particularly large in Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands, where GPs' earnings are less than ha lf that of specialists. The gap is much smaller in Iceland and the United Kingdom. In many countries, the remuneration of specialists has grown more quickly over the past five to ten years than that of GPs, widening the income gap (Figure 3.5.2). This has been the case in Australia, Finland, France and Hungary. In the United Kingdom, the incomes of both GPs and specialists have increased rapidly over the past ten years, with the growth rate in GP remuneration exceeding that of specialists. This can be attributed to the implementation of a new GP contract in 2004 designed to increase the number of GPs and improve the quality of primary care through better financial rewards. While the introduction of the new contract was expected to lead to additional cost, the actual cost in the first three years following its introduction was 9.4% higher than expected. There has been much debate in the United Kingdom on the gains that have been achieved in return for the extra spending (OECD, 2009d). Some of the variations in the remuneration levels of GPs and specialists across countries can be explainedby the use of different remuneration methods(e.g.salaries, fee-for-services, pay-for-performance schemes), by the role of GPs as gatekeepers, by differ- ences in working time, and by the number of doctors per capita, particularly for specialists (Fujisawa and Lafortune, 2008). Definition and deviations The remuneration of doctors refers to averagegross annual income, including social security contributions and income taxes payable by theemployee. It should normally include all extra formal payments, such as bonuses and payments for night shifts, on-call and overtime, and exclude practice expenses for self-employed doctors. A number of data limitations contribute to an under-estimation of remuneration levels in some countries: 1) payments for overtime work or social security contributions are excluded in some countries (Austria, Ireland for specialists, Mexico, the Netherlands for salaried specialists, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland); 2) incomes from private practices for salaried doctors are not included in some countries; 3) informal payments, wh ich may be common in certain countries ( e.g. Greece, Hungary and Mexico), are not included; and 4) in Greece, Hungary and Mexico, data relate only to public sector employees who tend to earn less than those working in the private sector. The data for some countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, United Kingdom for specialists, and the United States) include part-time workers, while in other countries the data refer only to doctors working full-time. In Belgium, practice expenses for self-employed doctors are not excluded, resulting in an over- estimation of their remuneration.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.6. Gynaecologists and ob stetricians, and midwives Gynaecologists are concerned with the functions and diseases specific to women, especially those affecting the reproductive system, while obstetricians special- ise in pregnancy and childbirth. A doctor will often specialise in both these areas, and the data reported in this section does not allow a distinction between these two specialties. Midwives provide care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and child- birth and the post-natal period for cases without complications. They deliver babies working indepen- dently or in collaboration with doctors and nurses. In countries with a medicalised approach to preg- nancy, obstetricians provid e the majority of care. Where a less medicalised approach exists, trained midwives are the lead professionals, often working in collaboration with other health professionals like general practitioners, al though obstetricians may be called upon if complications arise. Regardless of the different mix of providers across countries, the progress achieved over the past few decades in the provision of pre-natal advice and pregnancy surveil- lance, together with progress in obstetrics to deal with complicated births, have resulted in major reductions in perinatal mortality in all OECD countries. The number of gynaecologists and obstetricians per 100 000 women is the highest in Greece, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Germany and Austria (Figure 3.6.1). These are all countries wher e obstetricians are given a primary role in providing pre-natal and childbirthcare. It was the lowest in Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Canada. Since 1995, the number of gynaecologists and obstetri- cians per woman has increased in most countries, with an average growth rate of just over 1% per year during that period. The number of gynaecologists and obste- tricians per woman has remained relatively stable in Canada, France, Ireland and the United States, while it declined in Japan and Hungary (Figure 3.6.2). The number of midwives per 100 000 women is high- est in Australia, Iceland and Sweden (Figure 3.6.3). These two Nordic countries have a large number of midwives assuming primary responsibility for prena- tal care and normal delivery (Johanson, 2002). On theother hand, the number of midwives per woman is the lowest in the United States, Canada and Korea. In Canada and the United States, the number ofmidwives has increased at a rapid pace since 1995, but still remains very low co mpared with most other OECD countries (Figure 3.6.4). In Hungary, the numberof midwives per woman has come down, with most of the reduction occurring between 2006 and 2007, as the number of beds in maternity wards was cut down by more than one-third in the context of a health reform. In the Czech Republic, the number of mid- wives per woman has also decreased, although part of the decline is due to a change in methodology in reporting midwives following the introduction of a new legislation in 2004. The relative mix of providers has direct and indirect implications on the costs of pre-natal and natalservices. Services involving midwives are likely to be cheaper. This reflects in part the lower training time and hence a lower required compensating pay formidwives in comparison to gynaecologists and obste- tricians. Additionally, obstetricians may be inclined to provide more medicalised services. A study of nine European countries found that the cost of delivery is lower in those countries and hospitals that employ more midwives and nurses than obstetricians (Bellanger and Or, 2008). There is little evidence that systems that rely more on midwives are less effective. A review of a number of studies finds that midwives are equally effective in providing pre-natal care and advice in the case of normal pregnancies (Di Mario et al. , 2005), although support from obstetricians is required for complica-tions. Some evidence from the United States suggests a better performance in term of neonatal mortality formidwife attended births (Miller, 2006). Definition and deviations The number of gynaecologists and obstetricianscombines these two specialities. The figures for gynaecologists and obstetricians, and for midwives, are presented in head counts, not taking into account how many of them may work full-time or part-time.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.7. Psychiatrists At any point in time, about 10% of the adult popula- tion will report having some type of mental or behav- ioural disorder (WHO, 2001). People with mentalhealth problems may receive help from a variety of professionals, including general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, specialist nurses and others. In Europe, a population-based survey carried out in 2005-06 indi-cated that, on average across EU countries, 13% of the population reported seeking help from a health pro- fessional for a psychological or emotional health problem over the past year ( Eurobarometer , 2006). Among the people who sought help, two-thirds (67%)had consulted a general practitioner, while 15% sought help from a psychiatrist and another 15% from a psychologist (Figure 3.7.3). This section focuses on one category of mental health service provider, psychiatrists, as the availability of comparable data on others, such as psychologists, is more limited. Psychiatrists are responsible for diagnos- ing and treating a variety of serious mental health problems, including depression, learning disabilities, alcoholism and drug addictio n, eating disorders, and personality disorders such as schizophrenia. The number of psychiatrists in most OECD countries is between 10 and 20 per 100 000 population. The numberis highest in Switzerland, some Nordic countries (Iceland and Norway) and France. It is the lowest inTurkey, Korea, Poland, Hungary and Spain (Figure 3.7.1). The number of psychiatrists per capita has increasedsince 1995 in most OECD countries for which data are available. The rise has been particularly rapid in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany and Austria. On the other hand, there has been no increase in the number of psychiatrists per capita in France, Hungary, Portugal and the United States since 1995 (Figure 3.7.2). In France, most of the increase happened in the 1970s. As is the case for many other medical specialties, psychiatrists may be unevenly distributed across regions within each country, with some regions beingunderserved. For example, in Australia, the number of psychiatrists per capita is seven times greater in major cities than in remote regions (AIHW, 2008b). The role of psychiatrists va ries across countries. A country like Spain has deliberately chosen to use psychiatrists to work in close co-operation with general practitioners (GPs). Hence, although the number of psychiatrists is relatively low, consultation rates of psychiatrists by people with mental disorders are higher than in other countries where the number of psychiatrists is higher, because of higher referral rates from their GPs (Kovess-Masfety, 2007). The role of other mental health service providers such as psychologists also varies across countries. Forinstance, in the Ne therlands, there is a high number of psychologists who are very active in providingservices that are covered under health insurance systems. In other countr ies such as France, the number of psychologists is lower and the services thatthey provide are not covered under public health insurance (Kovess-Masfety, 2007). Definition and deviations Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specializein the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. They have post-graduate training in psychiatry, and may also have additional training in a psychiatric specialty, such as neu- ropsychiatry and child psychiatry. Psychiatrists can prescribe medication, which psychologists cannot do in most countries. The figures normally include psychiatrists, neuropsychiatrists and child psychiatrists. Psychologists are excluded. The numbers are presented as head counts, regardless of whether psychiatrists work full-time or part-time. 3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.8. Practising nurses Nurses are usually the most numerous health profes- sion, greatly outnumbering physicians in most OECD countries. Nurses play a critical role in providing health care not only in traditional settings such as hospitals and long-term care institutions but increas- ingly in primary care (especially in offering care to the chronically ill) and in domiciliary settings. However, there are concerns in many countries about shortages of nurses, and these concerns may well intensify in the future as the demand for nurses continues to increase and the ageing of the \"baby boom\" genera- tion precipitates a wave of retirements among nurses. These concerns have prompted actions in many coun- tries to increase the training of new nurses combined with efforts to increase the retention of nurses in the profession (OECD, 2008e). This section presents data on the number of practising nurses, separating where applicable \"professional nurses\" from \"associate professional nurses\" (although these two categories of nurses often have different names in different countries). In 2007, there were over 30 nurses per 1 000 population in Norway, followed by Ireland with over 15, to a low of about two in Turkey and Mexico (Figure 3.8.1). The OECD average was 9.6 nurses per 1 000 population. In Norway, more than half of nurses are \"associate professionals\" who have high-school education only and provide mainly social care. By contrast, in many other countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the vast majority of nurses are profes- sional nurses. In some countries such as France, Portugal and Poland, the category of \"associate profes- sional nurses\" does not exist, although professional nurses can be assisted by nursing aids who do not, however, have a formal recognition as a nurse. The number of nurses per 1 000 population rose at an average rate of 1.4% per year between 2000 and 2007 across OECD countries (Figure 3.8.2). In Australia, the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic, the number of nurses per capita actually declined since 2000 (since 2004 in the case of the Netherlands). In Canada, following a decrease in the number of nurses per capita during the 1990s, the numbers have risen again over the past few years, following increased efforts to train more nurses (see Indicator 3.9 \"Nursing graduates\"). The United States has the largest nurse workforce of all OECD countries, with close to 3 million \"professional nurses\" and more than 700 000 \"associate professionalnurses\", but there is still a growing demand (Aiken and Cheung, 2008). Unless greater efforts are made to train more nurses, a shortage of one million professional nurses is projected in the United States by 2020 (HRSA, 2004). Some measures have already been taken to increase the number of graduates from nursing education programmes (see Indicator 3.9). In 2007, the nurse-to-doctor ratio ranged from over five nurses per doctor in Norway and Ireland to under one nurse per doctor in Greece (Figure 3.8.3). The number of nurses per doctor is also relatively low in other southern European countries (Portugal, Italy and Spain). The average across OECD countries is just over three nurses per doctor, with most countriesreporting between two to four nurses per doctor. In Greece and Italy, there is evidence of an over-supply of doctors and under-supply of nurses, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources (OECD, 2009c; Chaloff, 2008). Definition and deviations Practising nurses include nurses employed in all public and private settings, including the self- employed, who are providing services directly to patients. In most countries, the data include both \"professional nurses\" who have a higher level of education and perform higher level tasks and \"associate professional nurses\" who have a lower level of education but are nonetheless recognised and registered as nurses. Midwives, nursing aids who are not recognised as nurses, and nurses working in administration and research should normally be excluded. However, about half of OECD countries include midwives because they are considered as a specialist nurse, and a number of countries include non-practising nurses working in administration and research (resulting in anover-estimation). Austria reports only nurses working in hospitals, resulting in an under- estimation. Data for Germany does not include about 250 000 nurses (representing an additional 30% of nurses) who have three years of educa- tion and are providing services for the elderly.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.9. Nursing graduates Many OECD countries have taken steps in recent years to expand the number of students in nursing educa- tion programmes in response to concerns about current or anticipated shortages of nurses. Increasing investment in nursing education is particularly important as the nursing workforce is ageing in many countries and the baby boom generation of nurses approaches retirement. On average in OECD countries, there were 36 newly- graduated nurses per 100 000 population in 2007 (Figure 3.9.1). The number was the highest in the Slovak Republic, Norway and Switzerland. In the Slovak Republic, nurse graduation rates in 2007 were much higher than in preceding years, signallingrecent efforts to increase the number of nurses. In Norway and Switzerland, nurse graduation rates have consistently been above the OECD average since the mid-1980s, explaining why these countries have a higher number of nurses pe r capita (see Indicator 3.8). On the other hand, nurse graduation rates have tradi-tionally been low in Turkey, Greece and Italy, three countries which report a relatively low number of nurses per capita. In Luxembourg, nurse graduation rates are also low, but a large number of nurses are foreign-trained. The institutional arrangements for nursing education differ across OECD countries. In some countries, the number of students admitted in nursing programmes is decided in a decentralised way, without any numeri- cal limits. This is the case in Belgium, the Netherlands,Norway, New Zealand and the United States, although in this latter case State deci sions on public funding for nursing education have a direct impact on the capacityof nursing schools to admit students. In most coun- tries, however, entry into nursing programmes is regulated (OECD, 2008e). When compared to the current number of nurses, there were 42 nurse graduates per 1 000 practising nurses on average in OECD countries in 2007 (Figure 3.9.2). The number of new graduates per practising nurses was high in the Slovak Republic, Korea and Portugal, although in the latter two countries this is partly explained by the relatively low number of nurses. The number of new graduates per practising nurses is the lowest in Luxembourg, which is compensated by the import of nurses trained in other countries. Nurse graduation rates are also low in Ireland which has also been relying on immigration to fill some of its need (OECD, 2007a). In Italy, concerns about current and future shortages of nurses have led to a sign ificant increase in student intake in university nursing programmes in recentyears, resulting in a rise in the number of newly-graduated nurses from less than 6 000 in 2002 to over 10 000 in 2007. Nonetheless, this may not be sufficient to meet current and future demand, given that the number of nurses leaving the profession annually is estimated to be in the range of 13 000 to 17 000 (Chaloff, 2008). In many OECD countries, there has been an increase in the number of students graduating from nursing programmes since 2000 (Figure 3.9.3). This has been the case, for instance, in France, Norway, Switzerland and the United States. In the United States, the Federal budget for fiscal year 2010 provides for addi- tional funding to enhance the capacity of nursingschools to increase the nu mber of nurses (Office of Management and Budget, 2009). In Denmark, the number of nursing graduates has been relatively stable between 2000 and 2007, but the capacity of nursing colleges has also been increased by 10% since 2007 in response to reported shortages of nurses (OECD, 2008b). In Japan, the number of nursing graduates has declined between 2000 and 2007, reflect- ing a reduction in the number of nursing schools and student capacity. However, this reduction in training capacity has been reversed since 2006, which should lead to a growing number of graduates in the years ahead (Japanese Nursing Association, 2009). Definition and deviations Nursing graduates refer to the number of students who have obtained a recognised qualifi- cation required to become a licensed or registerednurse. They exclude graduates from Masters or PhD degrees in nursing to avoid double-counting people acquiring further qualifications. The numbers reported by Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, Spain and the United States do not include graduates from lower level nursing programmes, nor are graduates from three-year education programmes focusing on elderly care included in Germany, resulting in an under- estimation in graduation rates per capita. However, the calculation of graduation rates per practising nurses includes the same categories of nurses in the numerator and the denominator to avoid any under-estimation. The United Kingdom excludes nursing gradu- ates from overseas.3. HEALTH WORKFORCE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 793.9.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.10. Remuneration of nurses The remuneration level of nurses is one of the factors affecting job satisfaction and the attractiveness of the profession. It also has a direct impact on costs, as wages represent one of the main spending items in health systems. Gathering comparable data on the remuneration of nurses is difficult because different countries collect data based on different so urces, covering different categories of nurses. The data presented in thissection generally focus on the remuneration of nurses working in hospitals, although the data coverage for some countries differs (see the box below on \"Definition and deviations\"). Hence, the data should be interpreted with caution. The data on the remuneration of nurses is presented in two ways. First, it is compared with the average wage of all workers in each country, providing some indication on the relative financial attractiveness of nursing compared to other occupations. Second, the remuneration level in each country is converted into a common currency, the US dollar, and adjusted for purchasing power parity, to provide an indication ofthe relative economic well-being of nurses compared with their counterparts in other countries. In most countries, the remuneration of nurses is above the average wage of all workers in their country (Figure 3.10.1). This is particularly the case in Mexico, where the income of nurses is more than two times greater than the average wage. In Portugal, it is 70% higher. On the other hand, the income of nurses is lower than the average wage in Hungary, Slovak Republic,Czech Republic and Finland. In Finland, the growth in the salary of nurses lagged behind the growth in the average wage between 2000 and 2007, but in 2008, nurses have obtained a substantial pay raise which should narrow this gap. When converted to a common currency, the remunera- tion of nurses is four to six times higher in Luxembourg than in Hungary, Slovak Republic and Czech Republic (Figure 3.10.2). Nurses in the United States also have relatively high earnings co mpared with their counter- parts in other countries. This might explain the ability of the United States to attract many nurses from other countries (OECD, 2007a; Aiken and Cheung, 2008). In Mexico, although the salary of nurses appears to be high compared to other workers in the country, their income level is low compared to nurses in the United States and other countries. The remuneration of nurses in real terms (taking into account inflation) has increased in all OECD countries over the past five to ten years, with the exception of Mexico where it declined between 2003 and 2007(Figure 3.10.3). The growth rate in the remuneration of nurses was particularly strong in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, narrowing the gap to a certain extent with their counterparts in other European countries. In the United Kingdom, the income of nurses in real terms grew at an average of 3% per year over the past ten years, two-times more rapidly than the growth in the average wage in the economy. There is some evidence that low wage is one of the reasons why some nurses leave the profession (Hasselhorn et al. , 2005). However, other research found only a weak relationship between wage andnurse labour supply (Shield, 2004; Chiha and Link, 2003; Antonazzo et al. , 2003). Other policies, such as improving working-time flexibility and creating career development opportunities, may also help to attract and retain more nurses in the profession (OECD, 2008e). Definition and deviations The remuneration of nurses refers to average gross annual income, including social security contributions and income taxes payable by theemployee. It should normally include all extra formal payments, such as bonuses and pay- ments for night shifts and overtime. In most countries, the data relate specifically to nurses working in hospitals, although in New Zealand and the United States the data also cover nurses working in other settings. Data refer only to registered (\"professional\") nurses in Australia, Denmark and Norway, resulting in an overestimation compared to other countries where lower-level nurses (\"associate professional\") are also included. The data relate to nurses working full-time, with the exception of Belgium where part-time nurses are also included (resulting in an under- estimation). The data for some countries do not include overtime payments ( e.g. Ireland and Mexico). None of the countries report data oninformal payments, which in some countries may represent a significant part of total income. The remuneration of nurses is compared to the average wage of full-time employees in all sectors in the country, except in Iceland, Mexico and New Zealand where it is compared to the average wage in selected industrial sectors.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.11. Dentists Dentists are the main provider of dental care, although some services are also provided by dental hygienists, dental assistants and dental prosthetists. Most dentists in OECD countries work in their own office or in a group practice (dental clinics), although a small proportion also work in hospitals and otherhealth care facilities. In most OECD countries, there are between 50 and 80 practising dentists per 100 000 population (Figure 3.11.1). Greece has the highest number of dentists per capita, followed by Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg, with 80 or more dentists per 100 000 population. The number of dentists per capita is the lowest in Mexico, although ithas increased significantly since 1990. Between 1990 and 2007, the number of dentists per capita has increased in nearly all OECD countries, except Finland, Sweden and Denmark where numbers were high to start with and remain well above the OECD average. The number of dentists per capita has risen particularly strongly in Portugal (it has more than tripled in absolute terms since 1990), and in Spain and Korea (the absolute number has more than doubled), although they remain well below the OECD average in Korea (Figure 3.11.2). In countries such as France, the Netherlands and the United States, the number of dentists increased at the same pace as the growth in the population, resulting in a stable number of dentists per capita between 1990 and 2007. A higher number of dentists per capita generally tends to be associated with a higher number of den- tist consultations (Figure 3.11.3). However, for a given number of dentists per capita, there can still be wide differences in the average number of dentist consulta- tions. For instance, while Japan has slightly fewer den- tists per capita than Germany, Finland and Denmark, the average number of dentist consultations is two to three times greater. Estimates of annual numbers of consultations per dentist can be derived by using information on dentistconsultations. Caution should be used in interpretingthis indicator as a measure of dentists' productivity, because consultations (which can include treatments) can vary in complexity, length and effectiveness. Nevertheless, Figure 3.11.4 shows large variations in the estimated number of consultations per dentist, with up to four-fold diff erences across OECD coun- tries. This might be due part ly to differences in aver- age working hours and partly also to differences in the availability of support st aff and assistants allowing dentists to see more patients per day. In Mexico, thesignificant increase in the number of dentists per capita since 1990 has been accompanied by relatively low activity rates, suggesting that the growth in supply may be exceeding the increase in the demand for dental care. By contrast, the strong increase in thesupply of dentists in Korea since 1990 has been asso- ciated with high activity rates. As is the case with other health professionals, there tends to be a higher number of dentists per capita in large cities than in rural areas. For instance, in France,there were four times more dentists per capita in Paris than in rural communitie s in 2006 (DREES, 2007). The low supply of dentists in rural areas might result inunmet dental care needs (see Indicator 6.1 \"Unmet health care needs\"). Definition and deviations The number of dentists includes both salariedand self-employed dentis ts. In most countries, the data only include dentists providing directservices to clients/patien ts. This is not the case however in Canada, Ireland, Portugal and Spain,where the data relate to all dentists licensed to practice, including those who may not beactively practising.3.

HEALTH WORKFORCE 3.12. Pharmacists Pharmacists assist people in obtaining medication and ensuring that these are used in a safe and proper fashion. In most countries, they have completed studies in pharmacy at university level and have completed an examination administered by the regu- latory authority to obtain a license to practice. In most OECD countries, there are between 60 and 100 pharmacists per 100 000 population. Japan, France and Belgium have the highest number of pharmacists per capita, with rates above 115 per 100 000 population (Figure 3.12.1). This high rate is associated with a high number of community pharmacies (Figure 3.12.3). On the other hand, the number of pharmacists per capita is the lowest in Denmark and the Netherlands, which isalso related to the fact that these two countries have among the lowest number of community pharmacies per capita. The relatively low number of community pharmacies in the Netherlands may be explained partly by the fact that patients can also purchase their prescription drugs directly from some doctors who are dispensing medications (Vogler et al. , 2008). Between 1990 and 2007, the number of pharmacistsper capita has increased in nearly all OECD countries, with the exception of Denmark and Belgium, although it remains high in Belgium. It increased most rapidly in Spain, Japan, Ireland, Portugal and Hungary (Figure 3.12.2). In Japan, the strong increase in the number of phar- macists can be attributed to a large extent to the government's efforts to separate more clearly drugprescribing by doctors from drug dispensing by phar- macists (the so-called Bungyo system). Traditionally, the vast majority of prescription drugs in Japan weredispensed directly by doctors. However, in recent years, the Japanese government has taken a number of steps to encourage the se paration of drug prescrib- ing from dispensing. In 1997, the Medical Service Lawwas amended to recognise the role of pharmacists as health professionals. The Medical Service Law was amended in 2006 and recognised community pharmacies as facilities providing health goods and services. Following these amendments, the percent- age of prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists rose from 26% of all prescriptions in 1997 to 57% in 2007,while the number of community pharmacies increased from 42 412 to 52 539 (Japanese Pharmaceu- tical Association, 2008). Most pharmacists work in community pharmacies. For instance, in Canada, 75% of all practising pharma- cists work in community pharmacies, while 15% to 20% work in hospitals and other health care facilities, and the remaining 5% to 10% work in the industrial sector and other settings (CIHI, 2008b). In Japan, 50% of pharmacists worked in community pharma- cies in 2006, up from one-third in 1990 (Japanese Pharmaceutical Association, 2008). Definition and deviations Practising pharmacists are defined as the num- ber of pharmacists who are licensed to practice and provide direct services to clients/patients. They can be either salaried or self-employed, and work in community pharmacies, hospitals and other settings. Assistant pharmacists and other employees of pharmacies are normally excluded. The data from the Netherlands exclude pharma- cists working in hospitals/clinics (resulting in a slight under-estimation). The data for Luxembourg exclude pharmacists paid by hospitals, but include employees in pharmacies and pharmacists working in administration. In Ireland, the data in clude all people on the register of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, possibly including some pharmacists who are not in activity. In addition, the figures include assistant pharmacists, pharmaceutical assis- tants, and doctors who are dispensing medica- tions (approximately 140 in 2007), resulting in an over-estimation compared with the data provided by other countries. Assistant pharma- cists are also included in Iceland.3. HEALTH WORKFORCE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 853.12.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES Introduction This chapter presents comparisons on the supply and use of different ty pes of health services and goods in OECD countries. The provision of th ese services and the purchase of goods such as pharmaceuticals account for a large part of the health expenditure described in Chapter 7. Indicators on a range of important health services are presented, including services provided in the primary care sector and in hospitals. The chapter begins by looking at levels and trends in the number of consultations with doct ors, one of the most co mmon services received by patients. The diffusion of modern medical tech nologies is generally considered to be one of the main drivers of rising health expenditure across OECD countries. The next section looks at the supply and use of two specific diagnostic technologies, medical resonance imaging (MRI) units and computed tomography (CT) scanners. The discussion then concentrates on hospital activities, a sector which continues to absorb the largest share of health spending in OECD countries, accounting for 35% to 40% of overall expenditure in many countries. The description of hospital services begins with a review of the availability of hospital beds, along with their rate of use. It then looks at the number of hospit al discharges and the average length of stay in hospitals, for all conditions taken together as well as for a few selected conditions. Chapter 5 on \"Quality of Care\" compliments this by examining some of the reasons for hospitalisation that might be avoided, notably through better primary care for chronic conditions. The next set of indicators in this chapter look more specifically at certain high-volume and high-cost procedures. These interventions include revascularisation procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft and coronary angiop lasty for patients with ischemic heart diseases, dialysis and kidney transplants for patients su ffering from end-stage re nal failure, caesarean sections, and cataract surgeries. The main fi nding is that there are wide and unexplained variations in the use of differ ent procedures across countries. Over the past 20 years, research often originat ing from the United States as well as from other OECD countries has found that there can be an overuse or inappropriate use of certain medical or surgical interventions, in the sens e that some interventions may be performed on patients for which scientific evidence suggests that the risks outweigh the expected benefits (OECD, 2004a). On the other hand, there can also be an underuse of certain services that are medically recommended for patients with certai n conditions. Chapter 5 on \"Quality of Care\" provides several examples of the underuse of certain recommended services such as immunisation to prevent communicable diseases among children and other population groups. Chapter 6 on \"Access to Care\" adds information on inequalities in the use of certain health services among different socio-ec onomic groups within countries. In many countries, an important area of research has focussed on regional variations in medical and surgical procedure rates, which mi ght provide some indication on the possible overuse or underuse of certain interventions in each country. In the United States, large variations have been reported across different States in the provision of common surgical procedures, such as knee replacement and card iac surgeries, and these variations cannot be explained simply by differences in need ( Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care , 2005). Geographical variations can also be found for non-surgical se rvices, such as hospitalisations and physician visits. These findings indicate that there are al so unexplained variations in clinical practices within each country, which are important to keep in mind in interpreting variations observedacross countries.4. HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 89Introduction The final section of this chapter looks at the volume of pharmaceutical consumption, focussing specifically on the use of drugs that treat diabetes and depression, drugs that lower cholesterol, and antibiotics. As is the case for health services, there may be an overuse or underuse of different pharmaceutical drugs for patients with various conditions. The aggregate data presented in this chapter does not allow an y definitive conclusion on whether there is any inappropriate use of these pharmaceutical drugs, but they do show notable differences in prescribing levels across countries. While this chapter covers many important health services, it does not cover long-term care services nor palliative care (end-of-life care). Information on consultations with dentists are included in Chapter 3 on the \"Health W orkforce\", as part of the discussion on the number ofdentists and how this might affect dentist co nsultations across countries. Information on certain public health services, such as immu nisation rates and cancer screening rates, is provided in the next chapter on \"Quality of Care\", as they are deemed to be indicators of quality of care for communicable diseases and cancer.HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 904. HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.1. Consultations with doctors Consultations with doctors can take place in doctors' offices or clinics, in hospital outpatient departments or, in some cases, in patients' own homes. In many European countries ( e.g. Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain and United Kingdom), patients ar e required, or given incen- tives, to consult a general practitioner (GP) \"gatekeeper\"about any new episode of illness. The GP may then refer them to a specialist, if indicated. In other countries (e.g.Austria, Czech Republic, Iceland, Japan, Korea and Sweden), patients may appr oach specialists directly. The number of doctor consultations per person per year ranges from over 11 in Japan and Korea, and in the Czech and Slovak Republics, to less than 3 inMexico and Sweden (Figure 4.1.1). The OECD average is nearly 7 consultations per person per year. Cultural factors appear to play a role in explaining some of the variations across countries. For example, Japan and the Czech Republic are among the countries with the highest consultation rates although they report very different levels of health status and have very differ- ent physician density. But certain characteristics ofhealth systems may also play a role in explaining these variations. There are signs that countries which pay their doctors mainly by fee-for-service tend to have above-average consultation rates ( e.g. Japan and Korea), while countries which pay them mainly bysalary tend to have below-average rates ( e.g. Mexico and Sweden). However, there are examples of coun-tries, such as Switzerland and the United States, where doctors are paid mainly by fee-for-service and where consultation rates are also below-average, suggesting that other factors also play a role. (See Table A.7 in Annex A for more information on the mode of payments of doctors in each country.) In Sweden, the low number of doctor consultations may be explained partly by the fact that nurses play an important role in primary care, with many first contacts with patients carried out by nurses. Similarly, in Finland, nurses and other health professionals play an important role in providing primary care to patients in health centers, lowering the need for consultations with doctors (Bourgueil et al. , 2006). The average number of do ctor consultations has increased in most countries since 1990. The rise was particularly strong in Mexico, which started with a very low level in 1990. This can be at least partly explained by the rapid increase in physician density in Mexico during that period (see In dicator 3.2). In Sweden, the number of doctor consultations remained stable, whilein Canada and the United Kingdom, it fell by about1% per year between 1990 and 2007 (Figure 4.1.2). In Canada, the decrease can be attributed to the reduction in the proportion of consultations paid through fee-for-services, the only consultations identified and reported here. Information on consultations can be used to estimate annual numbers of consultations per doctor in OECD countries. This estimate should not be taken as a measure of doctors' productivity, partly because consultations can vary in length and effectiveness and partly because it excludes the work doctors do on inpatients, administration and research. It is also subject to the comparabilit y limitations reported in the box below on \"Definitio n and deviations\". Keeping these reservations in mind, this estimate variesnine-fold across OECD countries (Figure 4.1.3). Again, it is possible that some cultural factors play a part, because there is clustering of the two OECD Asian countries and the central and eastern European countries at the top of the ranking. Chapter 6 on \"Access to Care\" provides additional infor- mation on disparities in the number of doctor consulta- tions by income group (Indicator 6.5). Definition and deviations Consultations with doctors refer to the numberof contacts with physicians (both generalists and specialists). There are variations across countries in the coverage of different types of consultations, notably the coverage of consulta- tions in outpatient departments of hospitals. The data come mainly from administrative sources, although in some countries (Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, GP consulta-tions in the United Kingdom and specialist consultations in New Zealand) the data comefrom health interview surveys. Estimates from administrative sources tend to be higher than those from surveys because of incorrect recall and non-response rates. The figures for the Netherlands exclude contacts for maternal and child care. The data for Portugal and Turkey exclude visits to private practitioners, while those for the United Kingdom exclude private consultations with specialists.4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.2. Medical technologies (supply and use) The diffusion of modern medical technologies is one main driver of rising health expenditure across OECD countries. This section pres ents data on the availabil- ity and intensity of use of two diagnostic technologies- computed tomography (CT) scanners and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units. CT (or CAT, for computed axial tomography) scanners and MRI units help physicians diagnose a range of conditions by producing cross-sectional views of the inside of the body being sc anned. Unlike conventional radiography and CT scanning, newer imaging technol-ogy used in MRI units do not expose patients to ionising radiation. The size and population density of a country is one of the factors affecting the number of equipment needed to re spond to the demand. The availability of CT scanners and MRI units hasincreased rapidly in most OECD countries over the past 15 years. Japan has, by far, the highest number of MRI and CT scanners per capita, followed by the United States for MRI units and by Australia for CT scanners (Figures 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). Some analysts attributed the rapid increase in MRI units in Japan, at least partly, to the lack of formal assessment of effec- tiveness or efficiency in purchasing decisions (Hisashige, 1992). At the other end of the scale, not surprisingly given their high cost, the number of MRI units and CT scanners were the lowest in Mexico and Hungary. Data on the use of MRI and CT scanners are available for a smaller group of countries. Based on this more limited country coverage, the number of CT examinations ranges from highs of 228 scans per 1 000 population in the United States, followed by Luxembourg with 177 scans, to lows of 45 scans per 1 000 in France, although the figures in France and Australia do not include CT exams in public hospitals, thereby resulting in an under-estimation. The United States also has the highest number of MRI examinations per capita(Figures 4.2.3 and 4.2.4). In the United States, some ev idence suggests that there is a high risk of overuse of CT and MRI examinations. Between 1997 and 2006, the number of scans in the United States have increased dramatically while the occurrence of illnesses have remained constant (Smith-Bindman et al. , 2008). Furthermore, to the extent that payment incentives allow doctors to benefitfrom exam referrals, this also increases the likelihood of overuse. Many studies have attempted to assess tangible medical benefits of the substantial increase in CT and MRI examinations in the United States but found no conclusive evidence suggesting such benefits (Baker et al. , 2008).Regarding the intensity of use of the equipment, as might be expected, there tends to be an inverse corre- lation between the availability of machines and the intensity of their use. In Hungary , Belgium and, to a lesser extent, the Czech Republic and Canada, fewer MRI units and CT scanners ar e associated with a more intensive use of each machine. Conversely, in theUnited States and Iceland, th e high availability of MRI units and CT scanners is linked to less intensive use ofeach machine. The inverted correlation between availability and intensity of use that is apparent in cross-country com- parisons is less apparent when looking at trends in the number of new equipmen t installed and their util- isation rate in each country. In Canada, for instance, there has been an overall increase in both the avail- ability and the intensity of use of MRI machines andCT scanners in recent years, indicating a substantial increase in the total numb er of exams. One explana- tion for the simultaneous increase in availability andintensity of use in Canada is that, in addition to a more intensive use of existing machines, the new machines serve regions that did not have access to the technology before (CIHI, 2008a). Definition and deviations MRI units and CT scanners relate to the number of equipment per million population. MRI examsand CT exams relate to the number of exams which can be divided either by the population or by the number of machines. Data are normally collected from both the hospital and the ambu- latory sector. However, data for some countries are under- estimated. Data on CT scanners and MRI units do not include those outside hospitals in some countries (Spain and Germany) or only a small number (France). For the United Kingdom, the data refer only to scanners in the public sector. For Australia, the number of MRI units (from 1999) includes only those eligible for reimbursement under Medicare, the universal public health system. In 1999, 60% of to tal MRI units were eligi- ble for Medicare reimbursem ent.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.3. Hospital beds (supply and use) The number of hospital beds provides a measure of the resources available for delivering services to inpa- tients in hospitals. It does not capture, however, the capacity of hospitals to furnish same-day emergency or elective interventions. Furthermore, this section focuses solely on hospital beds allocated for acute care, not taking into accounts beds in psychiatric careor long-term care units. The number of acute care hospital beds per capita is highest in Japan and Korea, with over seven beds per 1 000 population in 2007 (Figure 4.3.1). Both Japan and Korea have a problem of \"social admission\", that is, some \"acute care\" beds may be devoted to long-term care use (Hurst, 2007). The number of acute care bedsis also well above the OECD average in Austria and Germany. It is the lowest in Mexico, followed by Sweden and Spain. The number of acute care beds in hospitals has decreased in most OECD co untries. On average across countries, the number fell from 4.7 per 1 000 populationin 1995 to 3.8 in 2007. Only in Korea and Turkey has the number of acute care beds grown between 1995 and 2007. In Korea, the marked increase can be explained by the use of acute care beds for long-term care, the lack of capacity planning for hospital beds, and investment incentives in the private for-profit hospital system (OECD, 2003b). The reduction in the number of acute care hospital beds observed in most co untries has been driven, at least partly, by progress in medical technology whichhas enabled a move to day surgery and a reduced need for hospitalisation. In addition, cost-containment policies have often targeted the hospital sector, which remains the largest health spending category in nearly all OECD countries (see Indicator 7.3 \"Health expenditure by function\"). The reduction in the avail- ability of hospital beds has been accompanied in many countries by a reduction in hospital admissions and the average length of stay (see Indicator 4.5 \"Average length of stay in hospitals\"). In several countries, the reduction in the number of acute care hospital beds ha s also been accompanied by an increase in their occupancy rates. The occupancyrate of acute care beds stood at 75% on average across OECD countries in 2007, slightly above the 1995 level (Figure 4.3.2). Canada, Norway, Ireland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom ha d the highest occupancyrates in 2007. All of these countries have fewer acutecare beds than most other OECD countries. On the other hand, Mexico and the Netherlands have the lowest occupancy rates, with a rate below 65% in 2007. In the Netherlands, the occupancy rate has decreased sharply since 1995 while the number of acute care beds also fell. Definition and deviations Acute care hospital beds normally only include beds available for \"curative care\" as defined in the OECD Manual A System of Health Accounts (OECD, 2000). However, the functions of care included/excluded in \"acute care\" vary across countries and across time - for example the extent to which bedsallocated for long-term care, rehabilitation and palliative care are excluded - thereby limiting data comparability. Several countries ( e.g. Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg,Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States) report as acute beds all beds located in \"general\" or \"acute care\" hospitals. Also, some acute beds may be used for purposes such as long-term care ( e.g. in Japan and Korea). In the Netherlands, the calculation of occu- pancy rates is based on the number of licensed beds rather than the number of available beds, resulting in a slight under-estimation (the number of licensed beds can be 2 to 10% higher than the number of available beds). Private sector beds are not included, or only partially included, in Hungary and Ireland. Data for Finland are not based on an actual count of beds, but rather estimated by dividing the number of hospital days for acute care by the total number of days in the year (365); this leads to an under-estimation, given that occupancy rate is lower than the assumed 100% rate. The occupancy rate for acute care beds is calcu- lated as the number of hospital bed-days related to acute care divided by the number of available acute care beds (which is multiplied by the number of days, 365).4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.4. Hospital discharges Hospital discharge rates are a measure of the number of people who need to stay overnight in a hospital each year. Together with the average length of stay, they are important measures of hospital activities. However, overall discharge rates do not take into account differences in case-m ix (the mix of the condi- tions leading to hospitalisation). Hospital discharge rates are the highest in Austria and France, although the high rate in France is partly explained by the inclusion of some same-day separa- tions (Figure 4.4.1). Discharge rates are also high in Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Slovak Republic. They are the lowest in Mexico and Canada. In general, those countries that have morehospital beds tend to have higher discharge rates and vice versa (see Indicator 4.3 \"Hospital beds\"). Over the past decade, discharge rates have increased in some countries, most notably in Korea and Turkey which started with relatively low levels. They remained stable in other countries such as Australia, Spain and the United States, while they fell signifi- cantly in Canada, Italy and Iceland. In Canada, a marked decline in the number of hospitalisations was accompanied by a strong rise in the number of day surgeries in or outside hospitals (CIHI, 2007). Elderly populations account for a disproportionately high percentage of overall hospital discharges in all countries. In the United Stat es, 24% of all hospital dis- charges in 2006 concerned people aged 75 years andover, up from 16% in 1990. However, population ageing may be a less important factor in explaining changes in hospitalisation rates than evolving clinical prac- tices linked to advances in medical technologies. For example, hospital stays involving at least one revascu- larisation procedure (a coronary angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft) for people aged 75 to 84 doubled between 1990 and 2006 in the United States (NCHS, 2009). On average across OECD countries, the main condi- tions leading to hospitalisation in 2007 were circula- tory diseases which include ischemic heart disease, stroke and other diseases (13% of all discharges), pregnancy and childbirth (11%), diseases of the digestive system (10%), injuries and other external causes (9%), and cancers (9%). Austria has the highest discharge rate for circulatory diseases, followed by Germany, Hungary and Poland (Figure 4.4.2). The high rate in Hungary is associatedwith high mortality rate from circulatory diseases which may be used as a proxy indicator for the occur-rence of these diseases (see Indicator 1.4 \"Mortality from heart disease and stroke\"). This is less the case for the other three countries that have high discharge rates. In Germany, the high discharge rate for ischemic heart disease is associated with the highest rate of revascularisation procedures (see Indicator 4.6 \"Cardiac procedures\"). Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland also have the highest discharge rates for cancer (Figure 4.4.3). The high rate in Hungary and Poland is associated with high mortality rates from cancer, which may also be used as a proxy for the occurrence of the disease (seeIndicator 1.5 \"Mortality from cancer\"). However, this is not the case for Austria and Germany. In Austria, the high rate is associated with a high rate of hospital readmissions for further investigation and treatment of cancer patients (Eur opean Commission, 2008a). Definition and deviations Discharge is defined as the release of a patient who has stayed at least one night in hospital. It includes deaths in hospital following inpatient care. Same-day separations are usually excluded, with the exceptions of Canada, France and the United States which include some same-day separations. Healthy babies born in hospitals are excluded completely (or almost completely) from hospital discharge rates in several countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Korea,Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Turkey). Ireland also excludes discharges related to pregnancy and childbirth and certain conditions originating in the perinatal period. Some countries do not cover all hospitals. For instance, data for Denmark, Ireland, Mexico, Poland and the United Ki ngdom are restricted to public or publicly-funded hospitals only. Data forPortugal relate only to hospitals on the mainland (excluding the Islands of Azores and Madeira).4. HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 974.4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.5. Average length of stay in hospitals The average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) is often treated as an indicator of efficiency. All other things being equal, a shorter stay will reduce the cost per dis-charge and shift care from inpatient to less expensive post-acute settings. However, shorter stays tend to bemore service intensive and more costly per day. Too short a length of stay could also cause adverse effect on health outcomes, or reduce the comfort and recovery of the patient. If this leads to a rising read- mission rate, costs per episode of illness may fall little, or even rise. In 2007, the average length of stay for acute care for all conditions combined was the lowest in some Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden), Mexico andTurkey (less than five days), and the highest in Japan (19 days), followed by Germany and Switzerland (almost eight days). The OECD average was 6.5 days (Figure 4.5.1). Several factors can explain these cross- country differences. Short stays in Finland are linked, at least partly, to the ava ilability of beds for conva- lescent patients in health centres (OECD, 2005b).Conversely, the abundant supply of beds and the structure of hospital payments in Japan may provide hospitals with incentives to keep patients longer (see Indicator 4.3 \"Hospital beds\"). Financial incentives inherent in hospital payment methods can also influ- ence length of stay in other countries. For example, predominant bed-day payments in Switzerland have encouraged long stays in hospitals (OECD and WHO, 2006). The average length of stay for acute care has fallen in nearly all OECD countries - from 8.7 days in 1995 to 6.5 days in 2007 on average across OECD countries (Figure 4.5.1). It fell particularly quickly in those coun- tries that had relatively high levels in 1995 (Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary and Poland). Several factors explain this decline, including the use of less invasive surgical procedures, changes in hospital payment methods to prospective pricing systems, and the expansion of early discharge programmes which enable patients to return to their home to receive follow-up care. Focusing on average length of stay for specific diseases or conditions can remove some of the heterogeneity arising from different mix and severity of acute care conditions across countries. Figure 4.5.3 shows that ALOS following a normal delivery ranges from less thantwo days in Mexico, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Canada, to five days or more in the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. ALOS for normal delivery has become shorter in nearly all coun- tries over the past decade, dropping from 4.3 days in 1995 to 3.2 days in 2007 on average across OECD countries. Lengths of stay following acute myocardial infarction (AMI, or heart attack) also declined over the past decade. In 2007, ALOS following AMI was the lowest in Turkey, some of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden and Denmark) and the United States (less than six days). It was 11 days or more in Finland and Germany (Figure 4.5.2). Care is however required in makingcross-country comparisons. For example, ALOS in Finland may include patients originally admitted for AMI but who are no longer receiving acute care, and might therefore be considered long-term care patients (Mo\u00efse et al. , 2003). Definition and deviations Average length of stay (ALOS) for acute care refers to the average number of days that patients spend in hospital. It is generally measured by dividing the total number of days stayed by all patients in acute-care units in hospital during a year by the number of admis- sions or discharges. The definition of \"acute care\" includes all the functions of care covered under \"curative care\" as defined in the OECD Manual, A System of Health Accounts (OECD, 2000). However, there are variations across countries in the functions of care included/excluded in \"acute care\", thereby limiting data comparability ( e.g. whether or not beds for rehabilitation, palliative care and long-term care are included). In the calculation of ALOS, days and discharges of healthy babies born in hospitals are excluded or only partially counted in some countries.Including healthy newborns would reduce the ALOS in these countries ( e.g. by about half-a-day in Canada).4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.6. Cardiac procedures (coronary bypass and angioplasty) Heart diseases are a leading cause of hospitalisation and death in OECD countries (see Indicator 1.4). Coronary artery bypass graft and angioplasty are two revascularisation procedures that have revolutionised the treatment of ischemic heart diseases in recent decades. There is considerable variation across countries in the use of coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty (Figure 4.6.1). Germany, the United States and Belgium have the highest rates of angioplasty in 2007. These three countries also have the highest rates of coronary artery bypass grafts. While at the individual patient level, coronary angioplasty may be a substitute forcoronary bypass surgery, at the aggregate level,a higher rate of angioplasty in one country is not associated with a lower rate of bypass surgery.Countries that perform high rates of one type of revas- cularisation procedure also tend to perform high rates of the other. In Belgium, the high rate of both coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery can be partly attributed to a sizeable number of non-residents receiving these treatments in Belgian hospitals. In 2006, 2.5% of people who received an angioplasty on an inpatient basis in Belgium were non-residents; this proportion reached about 4% for people receiving a bypass surgery (European Commission, 2008a). The use of angioplasty has increased rapidly since 1990 in most OECD countries, overtaking bypass surgery as the preferred method of revascularisation around the mid-1990s - about the same time that the first published trials of the efficacy of coronary stent- ing began to appear (Mo\u00efse, 2003). The trend rise has also been supported by the introduction of drug- eluting stents and the decreased use of coronary bypass in most OECD countries. In most countries, angioplasty now accounts for between 65% and 80% of total revascularisations (Figure 4.6.2). Although angio- plasty has replaced in many cases bypass surgery, it is not a perfect substitute since bypass surgery is still the preferred method for treating patients with multiple-vessel obstructions, diabetes and other conditions (Taggart, 2009). A number of reasons can explain cross-country varia- tions in the number of revascularisation procedures, lence of ischemic heart diseases; ii)differences in the capacity to deliver and pay for these procedures; iii)differences in clinical treatment guidelines and practices; and iv)coding and reporting practices.The large variations in the number of revascularisationprocedures across countries do not seem to be closely related to the incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as measured by IHD mortality (Figure 4.6.3). IHD mortality in Germany is only slightly higher than the average across OECD countries, but Germany has thehighest rate of revascularisation procedures. On the other hand, IHD mortality in Hungary and Finland is well above the OECD average, while revascularisation rates are below average. Some countries may be under- utilising revascularisation procedures, while others may be carrying out too many costly interventions which have little benefit. Definition and deviations A coronary bypass is the grafting of veins and/orarteries to bypass an obstructed coronary artery. It may involve bypassing only one coronary artery, but multiple coronary artery bypasses are more common. Coronary angioplasty involves the threading of a catheter with a balloon attached to the tip through the arterial system, usually started in the femoral artery in the leg, into the diseased coronary artery. The balloon is inflated to distendthe coronary artery at the point of obstruction. The placement of a stent to keep the artery open accompanies the majority of angioplasties. Drug- eluting stents (a stent that gradually releases drugs) are increasingly being used to stem the growth of scar-like tissue surrounding the stent. The data relate to inpatient procedures, normally counting all procedures. However, classification systems and registration practices vary acrosscountries, and the same procedure can be recorded differently ( e.g. an angioplasty with the placement of a stent can be counted as one or twoprocedures). Some countries report only the main procedure (or the number of patients receiving one or more procedures), resulting in an under- estimation of the total number. This is the case for the Netherlands, Spain and the United States (for coronary bypass). In Ireland, the data only include activities in publicly-funded hospitals (it is estimated that over 10% of all hospital activity in Ireland is undertaken in private hospitals). For all countries, the data do not include coronary angioplasties performed on an ambulatory basis.4. HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1014.6.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.7. Treatment of renal failure (dialysis and kidney transplants) End-stage renal failure (ESRF) is a condition in which the kidneys are permanently impaired and can no longer function normally. Some of the main risk factors for end-stage renal failure include diabetes and hypertension, two conditions which are generally becoming more prevalent in OECD countries. In the United States, diabetes and hypertension alone accounted for over 60% of the primary diagnoses for all ESRF patients (37% for diabetes and 24% for hyper- tension) (USRDS, 2008). When patients reach end- stage renal failure, they require treatment either in the form of dialysis or through kidney transplants. Treatment in the form of dialysis tends to be more costly and results in a poorer quality of life for patients than a successful kidney transplant, because of the recurrent nature of dialysis. Taking into account both types of treatment, the proportion of people treated for end-stage renal failure has increased at a rate of almost 6% per year on average across OECD countries over the past two decades (Figure 4.7.2). This translates into a more than three- fold increase in the preval ence of treatment for ESRF in 2007 compared with 1985. In 2007, Japan and theUnited States reported th e highest rates, with more than 160 ESRF patients per 100 000 population(Figure 4.7.1). They were followed by Portugal which registered the highest growth rate since 1985. It is not clear why these countries report such strong rates of treatment for ESRF, but it does not seem to be solely or mainly related to a higher prevalence of diabetes, which is not particularly higher in these countries compared with other OECD countries (see Indicator 1.12 \"Diabetes prevalence and incidence\"). In most OECD countries, a majority of ESRF patients are being treated through dialysis as opposed to receiving a kidney transplant. This can be attributed to the fact that while the prevalence of people suffering from end-stage renal failure has strongly increased in many countries, the number of trans- plants has remained limited by the number of donors. The exceptions are Finland, Iceland and the Netherlands which have a relatively low level of ESRF patients overall. The proportion of people undergoing dialysis is much higher in Japan and, to a lesser extent, in the United States, than in other countries (Figure 4.7.3). In Japan, this is partly related to very low rates of kidneytransplants, meaning that nearly all Japanese ESRFpatients are treated through dialysis. In all countries, there has been a large rise in the number of persons undergoing dialysis over the past 20 years. Given the supply constraints, kidney transplants are normally performed on pati ents with end-stage renal failure when these persons cannot live without longand hard dialysis sessions. When successful, these transplants allow people to live again almost normally, without strict diet and activity limitation. Advances in surgical techniques and the development of new drugs preventing rejection have made it possi- ble to carry out more transplants, and to improve their rate of success, than was the case 20 years ago. Theprevalence of people living with a functioning kidney transplant has regularly increased since 1985 in all countries with available data. The OECD average rose from eight to 34 people with a functioning kidney transplant per 100 000 population between 1985 and 2007 (Figure 4.7.4). In 2007, the United States, Portugal and Austria report ed the highest rates, with more than 45 people with a functioning kidneytransplant per 100 000 population. On the other hand, the proportion of people having received a kidney transplant was the lowest in Japan, followed by Korea and the Slovak Republic. In many countries, waiting lists to receive a kidney transplant have increased, as the demand for trans- plants has outpaced greatl y the number of donors. The rate of transplants is also affected by cultural factors and traditions; tran splants may still be less accepted in certain countries such as Japan. Definition and deviations The number of patients treated for end-stage renalfailure refers to the number of patients at the end of the year who are receiving different forms of renal replacement therapy: haemodialysis/ haemoinfiltration, intermittent peritoneal dialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, contin- uous cyclical peritoneal dialysis, or living with a functioning kidney transplant.4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.8. Caesarean sections Rates of caesarean delivery (as a percentage of all live births) have increased in all OECD countries in recent decades. Reasons for the increase include reductions in the risk of caesarean delivery, malpractice liability concerns, scheduling convenience for both physicians and patients, and changes in the physician-patient relationship, among others. Nonetheless, caesarean delivery continues to result in increased maternal mortality, maternal and infant morbidity, and increased complications for subsequent deliveries (Minkoff and Chervenak, 2003; Bewley and Cockburn, 2002; Villar et al. , 2006). These concerns, combined with the greater financial cost, raise the question ofwhether the costs of caesarean delivery may exceed the benefits. In 2007, the caesarean section rate varied significantly across OECD countries (Figure 4.8.1), ranging from lows of 14% in the Netherlands to highs of nearly 40% in Italy and Mexico. The rates were also high (30% or more) in Australia, Hungary, Korea, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. The average across OECD countries was 26%. In the Netherlands, where home births are a usual option for women with low-risk pregnancies, 30% of all birt hs occurred at home in 2004 (Euro-Peristat, 2008). The increase in caesarean section rates slowed or even reversed in some OECD countries during the 1990s, as a result of changes in obstetri cal practice including trial of labor ( i.e. when a woman attempts labor and normal delivery after having a caesarean) to reduce the number of repeat caesareans (Lagrew and Adashek, 1998). But caesarean rates soon resumed their upward trend, due in part to report s of complications from trial of labor and continued changes in patient preferences(Sachs et al. , 1999). Other trends, such as increases in first births among older women and the rise in multiplebirths resulting from assisted reproduction, also contributed to the global rise in caesarean deliveries. The increase in caesarean rates since 1997 has been rapid in most OECD countries (Figures 4.8.2 and 4.8.3). Average annual growth rates of 4% or more were recorded in 12 OECD countries, with the highest growth rates in Austria, the Slovak Republic, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland and the Czech Republic. Caesarean section rates have grown at an annual rate of 3.9% across OECD countries from 1997 to 2007. Finland andIceland have had the lowest growth rates and are among the countries with the lowest caesarean rates in 2007. The continued rise in caesarean deliveries is only partly related to changes in medical indications. A study of caesarean delivery trends in the United States found that the proportion of \"no indicated risk\" caesar- eans rose from 3.7% of all births in 1996 to 5.5% in 2001 (Declercq et al. , 2005). In France, a 2008 study by the French Hospital Federation found higher caesarean rates in private for-profit facilities than in public facilities, even though the latter are designed to deal with more complicated pregnancies (FHF, 2008). A review of caesarean delivery practice in Latin Americancountries in the late 1990s similarly found higher caesarean rates in private hospitals than in public or social security hospitals (Belizan et al. , 1999). While caesarean delivery is clearly required in somecircumstances, the benefits of caesarean versus vaginal delivery for normal uncomplicated deliveriescontinue to be debated. Pr ofessional associations of obstetricians and gynaecologists in countries such asCanada now encourage the promotion of normal childbirth without interventions such as caesarean sections (Society of Obst etricians and Gynaecologists of Canada et al. , 2008). Definition and deviations Caesarean section rate is the number of caesare- ans per 100 live births. In Portugal, the denominator is only the number of live births which took place in National Health Service Hospitals on the mainland (resulting in an over-estimation of caesarean rates). In Mexico, the number of caesarean sections is estimated based on public hospital reports and data obtained from National Health Surveys. Estima- tion is required to corr ect for under-reporting of caesarean deliveries in private facilities. Thecombined number of caesarean deliveries is then divided by the total number of live births as estimated by the Nation al Population Council.4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.9. Cataract surgeries In the past 20 years, the number of surgical proce- dures carried out on a day care basis has steadily grown in OECD countries. Advances in medical tech- nologies, particularly the diffusion of less invasive surgical interventions, and better anaesthetics have made this development possible. These innovations have improved effectiveness and patient safety. They also help to reduce the unit cost of interventions by shortening the length of stay. However, the overall impact on cost depends on the extent to which any greater use of these procedures may be offset by a reduction in unit cost, taking into account the cost of post-acute care and community health services. Cataract surgery provides a good example of a high volume surgery which is now carried out predomi- nantly on a day care basis in most OECD countries. It has now become the most frequent surgical procedure in many OECD countries. The number of cataract procedures per capita ranges from a low of 59 per 100 000 population in Mexico to a high of 1 722 per 100 000 population in Belgium (Figure 4.9.1). Both demand factors (including an older population structure) and supply factors (such as thecapacity to perform the intervention in hospital and outside hospital) provide explanations for these cross- country variations. However, the comparability of data is also limited by re gistration problems, particu- larly the lack of registration of day surgeries carriedoutside hospitals in some countries, which explain the low rates in Ireland and Poland. The very high rate in countries such as Belgium may be explained partly by the registration of more than one procedure per surgery. The volume of cataract surgeries has grown over the past decade in most OECD countries. Population ageing is one of the factors behind this trend rise, but the proven success, safety and cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery as a day care procedure has probablybeen a more important factor (Fedorowicz et al. , 2004). Cataract surgeries are now predominantly performedon a day care basis in most OECD countries. Day sur- gery accounts for 90% or more of all cataract surgeries in a majority of countries for which data are available (Figure 4.9.2). However, the diffusion of day surgery is still relatively low in some countries, such as Poland and Hungary. This may be explained by more advan- tageous reimbursement for in-patient stays, national regulations, and obstacle s to changing individual practices of surgeons and anaesthetists (Castoro et al. , 2007), together with limitations in data coverage. InFrance, the share of cataract surgeries carried out on a same-day basis has increased rapidly over the past decade, from 19% in 1997 to 63% in 2007, but it still remains below that of many other OECD countries. In several OECD countries, there may still be room to increase the share of operations carried out on a same-day basis. In Sweden, there is evidence that cataract surgeries are now being performed on patients suffering from less severe vision problems compared to five or ten years ago. This raises the question of how the needs of these patients should be prioritised relative to other patient populations (Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and National Board of Healthand Welfare, 2008). Definition and deviations Cataract surgeries consist of removing the lensof the eye (because of the presence of cataracts which are partially or completely clouding the lens) and replacing it with an artificial lens. The surgery may be carried out as day cases or as in-patient cases (involving an overnight stay in hospital). Same-day interventions may either be performed in a hospital or in a clinic. However, the data for most countries only include inter- ventions carried out in hospitals. Caution is therefore required in making cross-country comparisons of available data, given the incom- plete coverage of day surgeries in several countries. Denmark only includes cataract surgeries carried out in public hospitals, excluding proce- dures carried out in the ambulatory sector and in private hospitals. In Ireland too, the data cover only procedures in public hospitals (it is estimated that over 10% of all hospital activity in Ireland is undertaken in private hospitals). The data for Spain only partially include the activi- ties in private hospitals. Classification systems an d registration practices for cataract surgeries also vary across countries, for instance whether they are counted as one intervention involving at least two steps (removal or the lens and replacement with an artificial lens) or as tw o separate interventions.4.

HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES 4.10. Pharmaceutical consumption The consumption of pharmaceuticals is increasing across OECD countries not only in terms of expendi- ture (see Indicator 7.4 \"Pharmaceutical expenditure\"), but also in terms of volume (or quantity) of drugs consumed. One of the factors contributing to the rise in pharmaceutical consumption is the ageing of the population, which leads to growing demand for drugs to treat or at least cont rol different ageing-related diseases. But the trend rise in pharmaceuticalconsumption is also observed in countries where the population ageing process is less advanced, indicating that other factors such as physicians' prescription habits or the degree of cost -sharing with patients also play a role. This section provides information on the current level and growth rate in the volume of consumption of four categories of pharmaceuticals: antidiabetics, antide- pressants, anticholesterols and antibiotics. The volume of consumption of these drugs is measured through the \"defined daily dose\" (DDD) unit, which is recommended by the WHO Co llaborating Center for Drug Statistics (see the box on \"Definition anddeviations\" below). There are a lot of variations across countries in the con- sumption of drugs for the treatment of diabetes, with the consumption in Iceland being almost three times lower than in Finland, Germany or Greece (Figure 4.10.1). These differences can be partly explained by the preva- lence of diabetes, which is low in Iceland and relatively high in Germany (see Indicator 1.12). However, some of the top consumers are not countries in which the preva- lence of diabetes is high. Between 2000 and 2007, the consumption of antidiabetics increased in all countries. The growth rate was particularly strong in theSlovak Republic (although it started from a low level), the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. The rise in consumption can be attributed to a rising prevalence of diabetes as well as increases in the propor- tion of people treated and the average dosages used in treatments (Melander et al. , 2006). Iceland reports the highest level of consumption ofantidepressants, followed by Australia and other Nordic countries (Figure 4.10.2). The Slovak Republic, Hungary and the Czech Republic have the lowest levels of consumption, although consumption of anti- depressants in these countries has grown rapidly over the past seven years. Germany is an exception with both low levels and slow growth in consumption. The consumption of anticholesterols ranges from a high of 206 DDDs per 1 000 people per day in Australia to a low of 49 in German y (Figure 4.10.3). While thismight reflect partly differences in the prevalence ofhigh bad cholesterol levels in the population, these differences can also be attributed to differences in clinical guidelines for the control of bad cholesterol. For instance, guidelines in Australia target lower bad cholesterol levels than th ose in European countries; and differences also exist in target levels withinEurope (National Heart Foundation of Australia et al. , 2005; Hockley and Gemmill, 2007). Both the epidemio-logical context (for instance, growing obesity) and increased screening and tr eatment explain the very rapid growth in the consumption of anticholesterolsacross all OECD countries for which data are available. The consumption of antibiotics varies from a low of 9 DDDs per 1 000 people per day in Switzerland to a high of 32 in Greece (Figure 4.10.4). As over-consumption of antibiotics has been acknowledged to create bacterial resistance, many countries have launched in recent years information campaigns targeting physicians and/ or patients in order to reduce antibiotic consumption. As a result, consumption has stabilised in many countries and even decreased in some others (such as France, Portugal and the Slovak Republic). By contrast,consumption has risen between 2000 and 2007 in countries that had below-average initial levels of consumption (such as Denmark and Ireland). Definition and deviations Defined daily dose (DDD ) is defined as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for adrug used on its main indication in adults. DDDs are assigned to each active ingredient(s) in a given therapeutic class by international expert consensus. For instance, the DDD for oral aspirin equals 3 grams, which is the assumed mainte- nance daily dose to treat pain in adults. DDDs donot necessarily reflect the average daily dose actually used in a given country. DDDs can be aggregated within and across therapeutic classes of the Anatomic-Therapeutic Classification (ATC). For more detail, see www.whocc.no/atcddd . Data generally refer to out-patient consumptionexcept for the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Sweden, where data also include hospital consumption. Greek figures may include parallel exports.4. HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1094.10.

QUALITY OF CARE Introduction W hich areas of the health care system are providing value-for-money and which show opportunities for performance improvement? While ongoing national and international efforts, such as the Systems of Health Accounts, are providing better information on health care spending, information on the value that health ca re services create is still limited. Quality of care, or the degree to which care is delivere d in accordance with established standards and optimal outcomes, is one of the key dimensions of value. Many OECD countries are reporting on quality of care at the national level, whereas other countries are still lacking the data infrastructure to derive such information. Internationally comparable data on quality of care are needed to allow countries to ex plore underlying factors in the organisation and financing of health care. The OECD's Health Care Quality Indicators project (HCQI) is developing a se t of quality indicators at the health care systems level (Mattke et al. , 2006; Garcia Armesto et al. , 2007). Its approach is to comp lement and co-ordinate efforts of national and other international bodies. Combined with other initiatives, this effort will offer policy makers and other stakehol ders a toolkit to stimulate cross-national learning. All 30 OECD countries, along with five European Union co untries that are not member countries, and Singapore, are now participating in the project. Constructing the toolkit requires three buildi ng blocks: a conceptual framework to define the dimensions to be captured; relevant and scientifically sound indicators to reflectperformance across those dimensions; and data to implement the selected indicators. Since its inception in 2003, the HCQI project has made significant progress towards assembling the firsttwo components. As discussed in the general in troduction of this publication, a conceptual framework has been developed that reflects th e shared understanding of countries regarding the key performance dimensions of the health care systems (Kelley and Hurst, 2006). There has been consensus that the project should initially focus on the technical quality of care(i.e.medical effectiveness). Several reviews have al so been completed and published to identify suitable indicators for quality of care in areas such as cardiac care, diabetes and mental health. The main limiting factor, however, remains the availability of data to construct quality indicators, especially at the international level. The limited adoption of electronic health records(EHR) means that the detailed clinical information required for many indicators is often unavailable, restricting the project to indicators that can be derived from more widely available, but less informative administrative data. The lack of use of unique patient identifiers (UPI) in some countries limits the ability to track patients across care settings and institutions and thus the opportunity to capture care pathways longit udinally. Lastly, differences in coding systems and data collection standards hamper the international comparability of indicators. In spite of those shortcomings, substantial progress has been made. A total of 40 indicators have been adopted, 23 of which are featured in this edition of Health at a Glance . These indicators cover key health care needs, all major health ca re services, and most major disease areas. New areas covered in this publication, co mpared with the previous edition of Health at a Glance, are the treatment of chronic conditions in primary care and mental health care. While several coverage gaps remain, such as patient safety and patient experiences, and comparability across countries still needs improvement, the indicators allow policy makers and other stakeholders to begin to draw inferences about relative health care system performance in several key areas. This chapter illustrates the use of HCQI indicators to explore policy questions in the areas ofcare for chronic conditions, acute exacerbations of chronic diseases, mental disorders, cancer and communicable diseases. The indicators cover both processes and outcomes of care for a range of conditions (see Table 5.1). The OECD HCQI website, available at www.oecd.org/health/hcqi , provides more information on the sources and methods underlying the data.5. QUALITY OF CARE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 113Introduction Interpretation and use of the data The indicators presented in this chapter do not provide a complete assessment of the performance of health care system s with respect to quality of care, as both their comparability and their coverage are limited. Since the last publication of OECD Health at a Glance in 2007, efforts ha ve been made to gather data that are as comparable as possible across countries. Improvements include the implementation of clear data quality standards and standard procedures for age and sex adjustment. Confidence intervals have been calculated to identify statistically significant differences between indicator values. Nevertheless, as with otherindicators in OECD Health Data , differences in definitions, so urces and methods remain, and are noted. In particular, additional work on improving comparability and adjusting for differencesin patient risk profiles across countries is ne eded. While the indicators are based on evidence and have been used for research and analysis within countries, it is not yet fully understood why they vary across countries. The development of further indicators to provide a more comprehensive account of quality remains nece ssary to allow more robust benchmarking of health care system performance. The data presented in this chapter should be looked at as raising questions about the quality of care in different countries, rather than providing definitive answers or normative judgments. While information is provided to assure the reader of the importance and scientificsoundness of each indicator, the data and findings presented should be considered as a starting point for a better understanding of variations in quality of care and to promote further analysis of different national experiences.

In response to the growing interest in monito ring and improving the safety of medical care (WHO, 2008a; Council of the European Union, 20 09), the OECD has been exploring the potential for international comparisons of patient safety using routine hospital administrative data (OECD, 2007c). In 2007, a preliminary study was undertaken among seven OECD member countries to investigate the feasibility of calculating a set of 12 indicators originally published by the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Given the encouraging results of this initial study (Dr\u00f6sler et al. , 2009a), an extended data collection was undertaken in 2008, involving 16 countries and 15 pati ent safety indicators (see Table 5.2). In order to facilitate comparisons, technical specifications and methods of calculation for these indicators were developed (Dr\u00f6sler, 2008), and the potential impact of national variations in the distribution of age and gender, length of hospital stay and medical and surgical treatment was assessed. This provided grounds for the OECD to colle ct seven of the indicators in 2009, namely: catheter-related bloodstream infections, po stoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, postoperative sepsis, accidental punctu re or laceration, foreign body left in during procedure, and obstetric trauma after vaginal delivery with or without instrument. A total of18 countries participated in the th ird round of data collection in early 2009. However, issues with the completeness and comparability of the underl ying data, and caution over the interpretation of the findings means that these indicators ar e not currently deemed suitable for presentation in this publication. A detailed technical report on the 2009 data collection and th e current state of development of the OECD set of patient safety in dicators has been released (Dr\u00f6sler et al. , 2009b) and can be downloaded from the OECD website: www.oecd.org/health/hcqi . This report identifies the key challenges that need to be addressed to enable meaningful comparisons of patient safety in the future, and foreshadows the ongoing work of the OECD to address data issues and enhance national information infrastructures. In particular, the need for improvements in the routine administrative databases of OECD countries is highlighted.

In addition to patient safety, the OECD is se eking to address the domain of responsiveness by strengthening the capacity for international measurement of patient experiences of health care. Recent work in collaboration with national experts and international organisations is focussing on the development and application of population-based survey instruments. The establishment of meaningful indicators in these two priority areas, along with further refinement and development of indicators within existing indicator areas ( e.g. health promotion, prevention and primary care), will allow a more complete assessment of the qualityof care provided through OECD coun try health systems in the future.HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1165. QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS Care for chronic conditions5.1. Avoidable admissions: respiratory diseases Asthma, a condition characterised by hyper-reactivity and chronic inflammation of the bronchial system, is the most common chronic disease in childhood, with increasing prevalence in recent decades. Childhood asthma prevalence in the United States has doubled to 9% since the 1980s (Moorman et al. , 2007). Asthma persists to adulthood in at least 25% of children (Sears et al., 2003). Approximately 30 million people in the European region are affected by asthma (Masoli et al. , 2004). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), some-times referred to as chronic bronchitis, is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world (WHO, 2006). The most important risk factor is tobacco smok- ing which causes 80% to 90% of COPD cases. Smokers are ten times more likely to die from COPD than non- smokers (HHS, 2004). Around 11.2 million Americans have manifest COPD and 24 million have evidence of impaired pulmonary function consistent with early stages of COPD (ALA, 2009). Treatment for asthma with anti-inflammatory agents and bronchodilators in the primary care setting is largely able to prevent exacerbations and, when they occur, most exacerbations can be handled without any need for hospitalisation. Hi gh hospital admission rates may therefore be an indication of poor quality of care.Admission rates for asthma have been used to assess quality of care by, for example, the United Kingdom National Health Service, and in the United States National Healthcare Qualit y Report (AHRQ, 2008b). While a cure of COPD is not possible, treatment approaches have proven to stabilise patients to avoid the need for hospital admissions (Jadwiga et al. , 2007). Innovative approaches, such as the \"Hospital at Home\" that originated in the United Kingdom, have shown to substantially decrease admission rates and cost (Ram et al. , 2004). As much of the responsibility for managing COPD lies with primary care providers, hospital admis-sion rates are a measure of the quality of primary care (AHRQ, 2007b). Figures 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 show that the age and sex- standardised hospital admi ssion rates for asthma and COPD vary substantially across OECD member coun- t r i e s . W h i l e o n a v e r a g e5 1o u t o f 1 0 00 0 0a d u l t s a r e admitted for asthma in a given year, the United States reports over twice this rate (120). Its neighbour Canadahas a much lower rate of 18 admissions. For COPD, variations of similar magnitude are reported. Onaverage, 201 admissions occurred per 100 000 adults in OECD countries, but the rate was as high as 384 in Ireland and as low as 33 in Japan. Austria, for example, reported over three times the rate of neighbouringSwitzerland. Figure 5.1.1 reveals that on average females are about 70% more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma than males, with the rate for females in the United States being more than double the rates of males. This may be due, at least partly, to the fact that adult asthma prevalence is usually higher in females. Figure 5.1.3 shows that COPD admission rates are correlated to a certain extent with estimates of COPD prevalence. This analysis points towards the explora- tion of potential gaps in care in countries with COPD admission rates that are higher than expected based on the reported disease prevalence. A similar correla- tion was not found between estimates of asthma prevalence and admission rates. Definition and deviations The avoidable asthma and COPD hospital admis-sion rate is defined as the number of hospital admissions of people aged 15 years and over per 100 000 population in that age group per year. There is evidence of differences in diagnosis and coding between asthma and COPD across coun- tries which points to limitations in the relative precision of the specific disease rates. Direct comparison of the asthma admission rates between the 2009 and 2007 editions of Health at a Glance is cautioned, given the rates for 2009 havebeen adjusted to take account of differences in the age and sex composition of each country's population and the age cohort has been revised from 18 years to 15 years and over. The preva- lence estimates for COPD were self-reported by countries and the validity and comparability of these rates have not been fully assessed.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS 5.2. Avoidable admissions: diabetes complications Driven by the rise in obesity rates, diabetes has become one of the most impo rtant public health chal- lenges of the 21st century. Over 150 million adults areaffected worldwide, with the number expected to double in the next 25 years (King et al. , 1998; IDF, 2006). Across OECD countries, prevalence is estimated to bemore than 6% of the population aged 20-79 years in 2010 and ranges from less than 5% in Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom to more than 10% in Mexico and the United States, (see Indicator 1.12 \"Diabetes prevalence and incidence\"). Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in industrialised countries and the most common caus e of end-stage renal dis- ease in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Individ-uals with type II diabetes have a two-to-four times greater risk of cardiovascular disease (Haffner, 2000). There is evidence that lifestyle changes such as weight loss and increased physical activity can prevent diabe- tes in high-risk individuals (Tuomilehto et al. , 2001). Better glycaemic control limits organ damage and vascular complications over time (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1996). Empiricaldata, however, reveals that such practices are under- utilised (McGlynn et al. , 2003). Hospital admissions for lower extremity (or limb)amputation reflect the quality of long-term diabetes treatment. Non-traumatic amputations are 15 times more frequent in diabetic patients than in the general population and 80% of amputations could be pre- vented, according to WHO estimates (Ollendorf et al. , 1998; WHO, 2005). Appropriate diet, exercise and drugtreatment combined with proper foot care can reduce the risk of lower extremity amputation. Since most related services are delivered or ordered by primary care providers, both admissions for acute diabetic complications and lower extremity amputations are suitable measures of the quality of primary care. Figure 5.2.1 reveals that many countries have rates of diabetes-related lower extremity amputation close to the OECD average of 15 amputations per 100 000 population, but the United States has morethan twice that rate with 36 admissions. Korea and Austria, on the other hand, have only about half theaverage admission rate. Admission rates for amputations are higher for men, even though diabetes is slightly more prevalent in women. Figure 5.2.1 reveals that diabetic males are admitted for lower extremity amputations at a rate nearly threefold that of females. This likely reflects the higher rates of vascul ar risk factors other than diabetes in men (AHRQ, 2009).Figure 5.2.2 illustrates that the United States has the highest admission rate for ac ute diabetic complications, with almost 60 admissions per 100 000 population or almost three times the OECD average rate of 21. The rate is below ten admissions in New Zealand and the Netherlands. Some countries have explicit targets to improve diabetes treatment at the primary care level. For instance, New Zealand has established a service target to increase the percentage of people with diabetes who attend a free health check and have satisfactory diabetes management (Ministry of Health, 2007). Figure 5.2.3 shows that amputation rates are not strongly correlated with estimates of diabetes preva- lence, indicating that the underlying rate of diabetes does not explain most of the variation in amputation rates. This, together with the magnitude of the variations for both acute complications and amputa- tions, indicates that furthe r investigation of systems of care is warranted. Definition and deviations Avoidable diabetes acute complication and lower extremity amputation hospital admission rates are defined as the number of hospital admissions of people aged 15 years and over per 100 000 population in that age group per year. Coding practices for primary and secondary diagnoses between countries might affect indicator rates. The rates have been adjusted to take account of differences in the age and sex composition of each co untry's population. The definition of the lower extremity amputationindicator includes amputation of the foot and toes in addition to more major amputations, such as above ankle, through knee and up to hip amputations. Minor amputations of the toe and foot do not necessarily indicate poor quality of care, as they may be carried out to prevent major amputations. In addition, given some minor amputations can be performed in certain primary care settings, clinical practices between countries might also affect indicator rates. Since definition rely on sp ecific procedure codes, different classification systems in use acrosscountries may impact on the comparability of the data.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS 5.3. Avoidable admissions: conges tive heart failure, hypertension Congestive heart failure (CHF), the inability of the heart to provide adequate circulation, is a severe condition with prevalence estimates of around 5% in Portugal and Denmark, and 3% in England (Ceia et al. , 2002; Raymond et al. , 2003; Davies et al. , 2001). As the risk of developing heart fa ilure increases with age and the presence of cardiovascular disease, prevalencerates for this disease are expected to increase sub- stantially in the future. Outpatient medical treatment with vasodilators and beta-blockers, combined with fluid management and controlled exercise, has been shown to improve survival rates of heart failure (SOLVD Investigators, 1991; CIBIS-II, 1999). Data from the Euro Heart Survey II on patientshospitalised with congestive heart failure showed limited adherence to eviden ce-based treatment, sug- gesting room to improve outpatient management of those patients (Komajda et al. , 2003). Data from the same research programme also revealed that one quarter(24%) of CHF patients had been re-admitted within 12 weeks of discharge and 14% of patients died between admission and 12 weeks follow-up (Cleland et al. , 2003). Given the high rate of re-admissions, even smallimprovements in care can have a substantial impact on cost and patient quality of life (Lee et al. , 2004). Hypertension or high bl ood pressure is the most common chronic condition of adult populations. Its global prevalence in th e adult population was estimated to be over 26% in 2000 (Kearney et al. , 2005). In itself, hypertension rarely causes symptoms but itis a risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, heart failure, and renal insufficiency. It is also associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Admissions with a primary diagnosis of hypertension typically indicate hypertensive crises, a condition characterised by very high blood pressure with high risk of acute complications such as heart failure or hemorrhagic stroke. However, hypertension admis- sions are largely avoidable and are an indicator for the quality of primary care (Tisdalea et al. , 2004). Figure 5.3.1 shows that Poland and the United Statesrecord the highest CHF admission rates with over440 admissions per 100 000 population, about twicethe OECD average of 234. The United Kingdom and Korea, on the other hand, have only about a fourth of the highest level of admissions. The gender gap is particularly large for the Nordic countries of Iceland, Denmark and Sweden where the male rate is about double the female rate, whereas on average in OECDcountries admissions for men are only about 50% more frequent than for women. Just over 80 admissions for hypertension are reported per 100 000 population in OECD countries on average (Figure 5.3.2), but Austria and Poland show over four and three times this rate, respectively. Conversely, countries such as the Unit ed Kingdom and Spain only report a fraction of the average rate. The overall use of admitted patient care is closely correlated with admission rates for hypertension (Figure 5.3.3). About two-th irds of the variation in admission rates for hyperten sion is associated with the variation for admissions for any cause. Countries like Austria have both above-average rates for hospital admissions for any cause and for hypertension, whereas countries like Ca nada and Spain have low rates for both. Definition and deviations The avoidable CHF and hypertension hospital admission rates are defined as the number of hospital admissions of people aged 15 years and over per 100 000 population in that age group per year. The rates have been adjusted to take account of differences in the age and sex compo- sition of each country's population. Given the technical definition of these indicators includes the specification of procedure codes, the different classification systems in use across countries may impact on the comparability of the data.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 ACUTE CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS Acute care for chronic conditions5.4. In-hospital mortality follow ing acute myocardial infarction Although coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in mo st industrialised countries, mortality rates have declined since the 1970s (seeIndicator 1.4 \"Mortality from heart disease and stroke\"). Much of the reduction can be attributed to lower mortal- ity from acute myocardial infarction (AMI), due to better treatment in the acute phase. Care for AMI has changed dramatically in recent decades, with the introduction of coronary care units in the 1960s (Khush et al. , 2005) and with the advent of treatment aimed at rapidly restoringcoronary blood flow in the 1980s (Gil et al. , 1999). This success is all the more remarkable as data suggest thatthe incidence of AMI has not declined (Goldberg et al. , 1999; Parikh et al., 2009). However, numerous studieshave shown that a considerable proportion of AMI patients fail to receive evidence-based care (Eagle et al. , 2005). AMI accounts for about half of the deaths from CAD , with the cost of care for CAD accounting for as much as 10% of health care expenditures in industria- lised countries (OECD, 2003a). Evidence links the processes of care for AMI, such as thrombolysis and early treatment with aspirin and beta-blockers, to survival improvements, suggesting that the case-fatality rate for AMI is a suitable mea- sure of quality of care (Davies et al. , 2001). Given the variety of services and syst em devices that need to be mobilised to provide care for this illness, the AMI case-fatality rate is regarded as a good outcome mea- sure of acute care quality. Currently, AMI case-fatality rates have been used for hospital benchmarking by the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Davies et al. , 2001) and the United Kingdom's National Health Service. It has also been employed forinternational comparisons by the OECD Ageing- Related Diseases Project (OECD, 2003a) and the WHO Monica Project (Tunstall-Pedoe, 2003). Figure 5.4.1 shows crude and age-sex standardised in-hospital case-fatality rates within 30 days of admission for AMI. The aver age standardised rate is just below 5%, with the rate being the highest in Korea(8.1%) and the lowest in Iceland (2.1%) and Sweden (2.9%). Other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway and Denmark) are also below the average. Differences in hospital transfers, average length of stay and emer- gency retrieval times can influence reported rates. Incountries with highly specialised emergency services, more patients reach the hospital alive but can ultimately not be stabilised and die within hours ofadmission. In other countries, unstable cardiac patients are commonly transferred to tertiary care centres, possibly biasing case-fatality rates down- ward, if the transfer is recorded as a live discharge. Case-fatality rates for women with AMI are typically higher, but the difference is not statistically signifi- cant for all countries. This reflects the fact that, while coronary artery disease is much more common in men, it is usually more severe in women. Figure 5.4.2 shows that case-fatality rates for AMI are decreasing over time in all reporting OECD countries, with the majority recordin g statistically significant reductions between 2003 and 2007. In Canada andother countries, improvements in AMI case fatalityrates reflect advances in treatment such as the increased rates and timeliness of reperfusion therapy, which seeks to restore blood flow to that part of the heart muscle damaged duri ng heart attack (Fox et al. , 2007 and Tu et al. , 2009). Definition and deviations The in-hospital case-fatality rate following AMIis defined as the number of people who die within 30 days of being admitted (including same day admissions) to hospital with an AMI. Ideally, rates would be based on individual patients, however, not all countries have the ability to track patients in and out of hospital, across hospitals or even within the same hospi- tal because they do not currently use a unique patient identifier. Therefore, this indicator is based on individual hospital admissions and restricted to mortality wi thin the same hospital. Differences in practices in discharging andtransferring patients may influence the findings. Both crude and age-sex standardised rates are presented. Standardised rates adjusts for differ- ences in age (45+ years) and sex and facilitatemore meaningful international comparisons.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 ACUTE CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS 5.5. In-hospital mort ality following stroke Stroke remains the third most common cause of death and disability in indu strialised countries (WHO, 2002). Estimates suggest that it accounts for 2-4% ofhealth care expenditure and also for significant costs outside of the health care system due to its impact on disability (OECD, 2003a). In ischemic stroke, represent- ing about 85% of cases, the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted, leading to a necrosis of the affected part. In hemorrhagic stroke, rupture of a blood vessel causes bleeding into the brain, usually causing more widespread damage. Treatment for ischemic stroke has changed dramati- cally over the last decade. Until the 1990s, it was largely accepted that the damage to the brain was irreversibleand treatment focused on prevention of complications and rehabilitation. But fo llowing the spectacular improvements in AMI survival rates that were achievedwith early thrombolysis, clinical trials (starting in Japan in the early 1990s) demonstrated clear benefits of thrombolytic treatment for ischemic stroke (Mori et al. , 1992). Dedicated stroke units, modelled after the verysuccessful Cardiac Care Unit, were introduced in many countries, particularly in No rdic countries, to facilitate timely and aggressive diagnosis and therapy of strokevictims. A recent meta-analysis of 18 studies showed that stroke units achieved about 20% better survival than usual care (Seenan et al. , 2007). Large randomised clinical trials in the United States(e.g. NINDS, 1995) and Europe ( e.g. Hacke et al. , 1995) have unambiguously demonstrated the impact ofthrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke on survival and disability. However, adoption of this practice is met with resistance due to factors related to the organisa- tion of health services (Wardlaw et al. , 2003; Wahlgren et al. , 2007). Stroke case-fatality rates have been used for hospital benchmarking within and between countries (OECD, 2003; Sarti et al. , 2003). While the average standardised case fatality rate for ischemic stroke is 5%, there is nearly a fourfold differ- ence between the highest ra te in the United Kingdom (9.0%) and the lowest rates in Iceland (2.3%) and Korea(2.4%) (Figure 5.5.1). Figure 5.5.2 shows the age and sex standardised and crude rates for hemorrhagic stroke. The average rate is 19.8%, about four times greater than the rate for patients with ischemic stroke, which reflects the more severe ef fects of intracranial bleed- ing. There is more than a threefold difference inreported rates between Luxembourg (30.3%) and the Slovak Republic (29.3%), and Finland (9.5%).Figure 5.5.3 illustrates that case-fatality rates for isch-emic and hemorrhagic stroke are correlated; that is, countries that achieve better survival for one type ofstroke tend to also do well for the other type. Given the initial steps of care for stroke patients are similar, this suggests that systems-based factors play a role inexplaining the differences across by countries. For example, a cluster of Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland) lie below the OECD average for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. These countries have been at the forefront of establishing dedicated stroke units in hospitals. Figure 5.5.4 demonstrates that case-fatality rates for both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke have declinedby around 15% across OECD countries between 2002 and 2007, with all countries recording a decrease in both forms of stroke. Th is suggests widespread improvement in the quality of care. Definition and deviations The in-hospital case-fatality rate following ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is defined as the number of people who die within 30 days of being admitted (including same day admissions) to hospital. Ideally, rates would be based on individual patients, however, not all countries have the ability to track patients in and out of hospital, across hospitals or even within the same hospital given they do not currently use a unique patient identifier. Therefore, this indica- tor is based on unique hospital admissions and restricted to mortality wi thin the same hospital. Differences in practices in discharging andtransferring patients may influence the findings. Both crude and age and sex standardised rates are presented. Standardised rates adjusts for dif- ferences in age (45+ years) and sex and facilitate more meaningful international comparisons. Crude rates are likely to be more meaningful for internal consideration by individual countries and enable a more direct comparison with the crude rates presented for this indicator in Health at a Glance 2007 .5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR MENTAL DISORDERS Care for mental disorders5.6. Unplanned hospital re-adm issions for mental disorders The burden of mental illness is substantial. Schizo- phrenia and bipolar disorder are among the top ten causes of years lost due to disability at the global level (WHO, 2001). Mental health care has become a policy priority in many OECD countries, coinciding with dramatic changes in the delivery of mental health services, espe- cially for severe disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Starting wi th de-institutionalisation in the 1970s, care has shifted from large psychiatrichospitals towards community-based care. Paradoxi- cally, the shift has made it harder to track mental health care at the population level, as few countries have a health information infrastructure suitable forfollowing patients across a variety of delivery settings. Unplanned hospital re-admission rates are commonly used as an indicator of insufficient care co-ordination following an inpatient stay for psychiatric disorders. Longer lengths of stay, appropriate discharge planning, and follow-up visits after discharge contribute to fewer re-admissions, indicating that re-admission rates reflect the overall functioning of mental health servicesrather than the quality of hospital care (Lien, 2002). Thirty-day hospital re-admission rates are part of mental health performance monitoring systems in many countries, such as the Care Quality Commission in the United Kingdom and the National Mental Health Performance Monitoring System in the United States. Figure 5.6.1 shows the variation in unplanned re-admission rates for schizophrenia, with Nordic countries at the higher end and the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy at the lower end. The pattern of re-admission rates for bipolar disorders (Figure 5.6.2) is similar, with the Nordic countries wellabove average. Most countries have similar rates for men and women, however, male patients with schizo- phrenia have higher rates in Italy while female patients are more likely to be re-admitted in Canada and Denmark. Regarding bipolar disorder patients, women have higher re-admission rates in Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Canada and Belgium. These num- bers may reflect differences in care seeking behav- iours or management related to a patient's gender. Supply factors such as the availability of hospitals beds (psychiatric and total), and the profile of in-patient facilities (percentage of in-patient care provided in psychiatric hospitals, general acute hospi- tals or residential fac ilities) cannot explain the variation in re-admission rates. The average length ofstay for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disor- der does not seem to be associated with variations in re-admission rates. Anecdotal evidence suggests that different approaches to cr isis management might play a part. For example, some countries with lowerre-admission rates, such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, use comm unity-based \"crisis teams\" to stabilise patients on an outpatient basis. Othercountries with high rates, such as Finland and Denmark, use interval care protocols to place unstable patients into hospital care for short periods. While there is broad consensus that community-based care is preferable to in-hospital care where possible, in certain countries the practi ce seems to be shifting towards supplementing or substituting community-based devices with in-hospital care. In the absence ofa comparable measure of ou tcomes across countries, the benefits of this altern ative approach are difficult to assess. The enhancement of mental health related information systems will be necessary to make this type of comparative information readily available. Definition and deviations The indicator is defined as the number of unplanned re-admission s per 100 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disor-der per year. The denominator is comprised of all patients with at least one admission during the year for the condition. A re-admission is considered unplanned when the patient is admitted for any mental disorder to the same hospital within 30 days of discharge. Same-day admissions (less than 24 hours) are excluded. The absence of unique patient identifiers in many countries does not allow the tracking of patients across facilities. Rates are therefore biased downwards as re-admissions to a differ- ent facility cannot be observed. However, the eight countries which were able to estimate re-admission rates to the same or other hospi- tals, show that rates based on the two different specifications were closely correlated and ranking of countries was similar, suggesting that re-admissions to the same hospital can be used as a valid approximation.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CANCER CARE Cancer care5.7. Screening, survival and mortality for cervical cancer Cervical cancer is largely preventable. Screening by regular pelvic exam and pap smears can identify premalignant lesions, which can be effectively treated before the occurrence of the cancer. Regular screeningalso increases the probability of diagnosing early stages of the cancer and improving survival (Gatta et al. , 1998). The Council of the European Union and the EuropeanCommission promote populati on based cancer screen- ing programmes among member States (EuropeanUnion, 2003; European Commission, 2008c). OECD countries have instituted screening programmes, but the periodicity and target groups vary. In addition, the discovery that cervical cancer is caused by sexual transmission of certain forms of the Human Papilloma Virus has led to the development of promising cancer preventing vaccines (Harper et al. , 2006). The efficacy and safety of those vaccines is now well established, but debates about cost-effectiveness and the implica- tions of vaccination programmes for teenagers for a sexually transmitted disease continue in a number of countries (Huang, 2008). Three indicators are presented to reflect variation in cervical cancer care across OECD countries: cervical cancer screening rates in women aged 20-69 years, five-year relative survival rates, and mortality rates for cervical cancer. Relative survival rates are commonly used to track progress in treating a disease over time. They reflect both how early the cancer was detected and the effec- tiveness of the treatment provided. Mortality rates alone are not sufficient to draw timely inferences about quality of care, because current mortality rates reflect the effect of cancer care in past years and changes in incidence. Survival rates have been used to compare European countries in the EUROCARE study, in comparisons between European countries and the United States (Gatta et al. , 2000), and in national reporting activities in many countries. Screening rates vary widely across OECD countries with the United States and the United Kingdom achieving coverage of around 80% of the target popu-lation (Figure 5.7.1). Some countries with very low screening rates, like Japan and Hungary, have no uniform national screening programme; the low rates reflect local programmes or opportunistic screening. The data indicates that screening rates in several countries slightly declined between 2000 and 2006. Nearly all countries recorded five-year relative survival rates above 60% for the period 2002-07. The rates ranged from 76.5% in Korea to 50.1% in Poland (Figure 5.7.2). Over the periods 1997-2002 and 2002-07, the five-year relative rates improved in most coun-tries, although in most instances the increase is not statistically significant. Figure 5.7.3 shows that mortality rates for cervical cancer declined for most OECD countries between 1995 and 2005, with larger improvements for many countries with initially higher rates, such as Mexico and several central and eastern European countries. Definition and deviations Screening rates for cervical cancer reflect the proportion of patients who are eligible for a screening test and actually receive the test. As policies regarding screening periodicity differ across countries, the rates are based on each coun- try's specific policy. An important consideration is that some countries ascertain screening based on surveys and others based on encounter data, which may influence the results. If a country has an organised screening programme, but women receive care outside the programme, rates may be underreported. Survey-based results may also underestimate the rates due to recall bias. Relative cancer survival rates reflect the propor- tion of patients with a certain type of cancer who are still alive after a specified time period (commonly five years) compared to those still alive in absence of the disease. Relative survival rates capture the excess mortality that can be attributed to the diagnosis. To illustrate, a rela- tive survival rate of 80% does not mean that 80% of the cancer patients are still alive after five years, but that 80% of the patients that were expected to be alive after five years, given their age at diagnosis, are in fact still alive. All the survival rates presented here have been age- standardised using th e International Cancer Survival Standard (ICSS) population. Datareported in Health at a Glance 2007 were not age standardised, therefore, rates presented in thisedition cannot be compar ed with those from the previous edition. The survival rates are notadjusted for tumour stage at diagnosis, hamper- ing assessment of the relative impact of early detection and better treatment.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CANCER CARE 5.8. Screening, survival an d mortality for breast cancer Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, with a lifetime incidence of about 11% and a lifetime mortality rate of about 3% in the United States (Feuer et al. , 2003). One in nine women will acquire breast cancer at some point in their life and one inthirty will die from the disease. Overall spending for breast cancer care typicall y amounts to about 0.5-0.6% of total health care expenditure (OECD, 2003a). The combination of public health interventions and improved medical technology has contributed to substantial improvements in survival rates for breast cancer. Greater awareness of the disease and thepromotion of self-examination and screening mam- mography (European Union, 2003; European Commis- sion, 2006) have led to the detection of the disease at earlier stages. Technological improvements, such as the introduction of combin ed breast conserving sur- gery with radiation therapy and routine adjuvant che-motherapy treatment, have increased survival as well as the quality of life of survivors (Mauri et al. , 2008). Three indicators are presented to reflect the variationin breast cancer care across OECD countries: mam- mography screening rates in women 50-69 years, relative survival rates, and mortality rates for breast cancer. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effec- tiveness of breast cancer screening and treatment in improving survival. Even though the optimal frequency of screening and the age-group to target are still the subject of debate, most countries have adopted screening programmes. For example, EU guidelines (European Commission, 2006) promote a target screening rate of at least 75% of eligible women in European countries. Resources and patterns for breast cancer treatment vary substantially across OECD countries, leading to an interest in comparing survival and mortality rates (OECD, 2003a). Breast cancer survival rates have been used to compare countries in the EUROCARE study (Sant et al., 2009), and in the CONCORD study (Coleman et al. , 2008) among other studies. In the Netherlands and Fi nland, close to 90% of women aged 50-69 years are screened annually, butonly around 20% in the Slovak Republic and Japan (Figure 5.8.1). Some countries with very low screening rates, like Japan, have no national screening pro- gramme; the low rates reflect opportunistic screening or local programmes. Some countries which had low rates in 2000, such as the Czech and Slovak Republics, showed substantial increa ses by 2006, whereas some countries with already high rates experienceddeclines, including the United States, Finland and Norway.Many OECD countries have survival rates of over 80%, with rates as high as 90% for the United States (Figure 5.8.2). The United States reports the highest survival rate for women diagnosed in 2002 and a screening rate for that year which is among the highest in the OECD. Given the effect of early detection through screening requires several years before it is manifest, the impact of the decrease in the United States mam- mography rates between 2000 and 2006 will remain uncertain until survival rates for future years become available. Figure 5.8.2 shows that relative five-year breast cancer survival rates have improved slightly in almost all countries between 1997-2002 and 2002-07, eventhough changes are usually not statistically signifi- cant. However , data from European countries over a longer time period confirm that five-year survival rates for breast cancer have increased over recent years and particularly in eastern European countries that historically had lower survival rates (Verdecchia et al. , 2007). Figure 5.8.3 illustrates that breast cancer mortality rates are declining in most OECD countries. Korea and Japan are the exceptions, though the changes are small and mortality levels continue to be the lowest among OECD countries. Conversely, improvements are substantial for countries that had higher levelsin 1995, like the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. Definition and deviations Mammography screening rates reflect the proportion of eligible women patients who are actually screened. As policies regarding target age groups and screening periodicity differ across countries, the rates are based on eachcountry's specific policy. Some countries ascer- tain screening based on surveys and others based on encounter data, and this may influenceresults. If a country has an organised screening programme, but women receive care outside of the programme, rates may be underreported. Survey-based results may also underestimate rates due to recall bias. Survival rates and mortality rates are defined in Indicator 5.7 \"Cervical cancer\".5. QUALITY OF CARE CANCER CARE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1315.8.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CANCER CARE 5.9. Survival and mortal ity for colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in both women (after breast and lung cancer) and men (after prostate and lung cancer). It isestimated that approximately USD 8.4 billion is spent in the United States each year on the treatment of colorectal cancer (Brown et al. , 2002). Advances in diagnosis and treatment have increased survival overthe last decades. Evidence exists that demons trates the clinical benefit of screening with routine colonoscopy and stool tests for occult blood (USPSTF, 2008) and various treatment modalities, such as surgery (Govindarajan et al. , 2006) and chemotherapy (CCCG, 2000), even for advancedstages of the disease. The same literature suggeststhat screening and treatment options are not suffi- ciently utilised. However, although organised screen- ing programmes are being piloted in several OECD countries, data on screening rates for colorectal cancer are not yet available at an international level. Variation in outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer is captured by five-year relative survival rates and mortality rates. Colorectal cancer survival rates have been used to compare European countries in the EUROCARE study (Sant et al. , 2009), to compare coun- tries around the world in the CONCORD study(Coleman et al. , 2008), and in many national reporting activities. Figure 5.9.1 presents the most recent five-year relative survival rates for patient wi th colorectal cancer. Japan has the highest relative survival rate of 67%, followedby Iceland and the United States with rates above 65%. Poland has the lowest rate with 38%, followed by the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. All countries show improvement in survival rates over time (Figure 5.9.2), although the increase is often not statistically significant. The United States whichhad the highest survival rate of 62.5% for patients diagnosed in 1997 improved to 65.5% for those diagnosed in 2000. The Czech Republic improved from 41% to 47% for the periods 1997-2002 and 2001-06.Historical data from France shows that the five-year survival rate between 1976 and 1988 increased from 33% to 55%, which is attributed to a higher resection rate with lower post-operative mortality, earlier diagnosis and increasing use of chemotherapy (Faivre-Finn et al. , 2002). These findings are consistent with results from other European countries (Santet al. , 2009) and the United St ates (SEER, 2009). Recent data from the EUROCARE pr oject showed that survival for colorectal cancer continued to increase in Europe, and in particular in eastern European countries (Verdecchia et al. , 2007). Mortality trends from colorectal cancer for the periodfrom 1995 and 2005 are shown in Figure 5.9.3. Mostcountries experienced a de crease in mortality for colorectal cancer in these ten years. While Korea'srates have increased markedly over time, these rates are still among the lowest in OECD countries. The rapid introduction of western-type diet is a possible explanation for this increase. As Figure 5.9.2 illus- trates, Korea has achieved a significant increase in relative survival rates over recent years, indicating that the health care system is addressing this new challenge. Central and eastern European countries tend to have higher mortality rates with no clear geographic pattern emer ging for the other OECD countries. Countries with hi gh relative survival rates, like Japan and the United States also have below-aver- age mortality rates, which supports the hypothesis that the differences in rela tive survival reflect better cancer care. Definition and deviations Survival rates and mortality rates are defined in Indicator 5.7 \"Cervical cancer\" and vary from the ICD 10 definition of colorectal cancer employed in Health at a Glance 2007 by also including anal cancer.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Care for communicable diseases5.10. Childhood vaccination programmes Childhood vaccination continues to be one of the most cost-effective health policy interventions. All OECD countries or, in some cases, sub-national juris- dictions have established vaccination programmes based on their interpretation of the risks and benefits of each vaccine. Vaccination against pertussis (often administered in connection with vaccination against diphtheria and tetanus) and measles is part of almost all pro- grammes, and reviews of the evidence supporting the efficacy of vaccines against these diseases have concluded that the respective vaccines are safe and highly effective. In Europe, the gradual uptake of the measles vaccine has meant that measles incidence isaround ten times less than th e rate of the early 1990s. A vaccination for hepatitis B has been availablesince 1982 and is considered to be 95% effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. In 2004, it was esti- mated that over 350 million people were chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus worldwide and at risk of serious illness and death (WHO, 2009a). In 2007, more than 170 countries had already begun to follow the WHO recommendation to incorporate hepatitis B vaccine as an integral part of their national infant immunisation programmes. In countries with low levels of hepatitis B ( e.g. Australia, New Zealand, northern and western Europe and North America) theWHO indicates that routine hepatitis B vaccination should still be given high priority given a high propor- tion of chronic infections are acquired during early childhood (WHO, 2004a). Figures 5.10.1 and 5.10.2 demonstrate that the overall vaccination of children against measles and pertussis (including diphtheria and tetanus) is high in OECD countries. On average more than 90% of 2-year-old children receive the recommended measles and pertussis vaccination, and rates for all countries are above 75%. Figure 5.10.3 shows the average percentage of children aged 2 years who are vaccinated for hepatitis B across countries with national programmes is over 95%. Anumber of countries do not currently require children to be vaccinated by age 2, or do not have routine programmes and consequently the rates for these countries are significantly lower than the other countries. For example, in Denmark and Sweden, vaccination against hepatitis B is not an obligatory part of their vaccination programmes, and is only recommended to specific risk groups. While Canada implemented universal hepatitis B vaccination for adolescents, not all provinces and territories offer programmes in early infancy (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009; and Mackie et al. , 2009). In France, hepatitis B vaccination remains controversial, givenongoing speculation over possible side effects. Figure 5.10.4 indicates that the incidence of hepatitis B in the majority of OECD countries is low, at less than two per 100 000 population. Only Austria, Turkey and Iceland have rates well above the OECD average of 2.5 per 100 000 population, and fall into the high-incidence category, based on WHO criteria (WHO, 2004a). Definition and deviations Vaccination rates reflect the percentage of children at either age 1 or 2 that receives the respective vaccination in the recommended timeframe. Childhood vaccination policies differ slightly across countries. Thus, these indicators are based on the actual policy in a given country.Some countries administer combination vaccines ( e.g. DTP for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) while others administer the vaccina-tions separately. Variations in rate may exist where the tetanus vacc ination rate has been provided in place of the pertussis rate, althoughthese are estimated to be less than 0.5%. Some countries ascertain vaccinations based on surveys and others based on encounter data, which may influence the results.5.

QUALITY OF CARE \u0081 CARE FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 5.11. Influenza vaccination for elderly people Influenza is a common infectious disease worldwide and affects persons of all ages. For example, on average, between 5% and 20% of the population in the United States co ntracts influenza each year (CDC, 2009b). Most people with the illness recover quickly, butelderly people and those with chronic medical condi- tions are at higher risk for complications and even death. Between 1979 and 2001, on average, influenza accounted for more than 200 000 hospitalisations and 36 000 deaths per year in the United States (CDC, 2009b). The impact of influenza on the employed population is substantial, even though most influenza morbidity and mortality occurs among the elderly and those with chronic conditions (Keech et al. , 1998). In Europe, influenza accounts for around 10% of sickness absence from work, while the cost of lost productivityin France and Germany has been estimated to be in the range of USD 9.3 billion to 14.1 billion per year (Szucs, 2004). Immunisation against seasonal influenza (or flu) for older people has become increasingly widespread in OECD countries over the past decade. Influenza vaccination for older people and patients with chronic conditions is strongly recommended in Europe, the United States and other countries (Nicholson et al. , 1995). Figure 5.11.1 shows that in 2007 the average percent-age of the population aged 65 years and over who were vaccinated for influenza is 56%. However, a wide variation in vaccination rates exists, ranging from 24% in the Czech Republic to 78% in Australia. Figure 5.11.2 indicates that while the OECD average increased markedly between 1998 and 2003, the average rate remained relatively stable between 2003 and 2007. From 2003, some countries marginally increased their coverage whereas others reduced their coverage, most notably some of the countries which were already below the OECD average, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. A number of factors have contributed to the current levels in influenza immunisation rates in OECD countries, including greater acceptance of preventa- tive health services by patients and practitioners, improved public health insurance coverage for vaccines and wider delivery by health care providers other than physicians (Singleton et al. , 2000). A number of barriers need to be overcome in somecountries if they wish to further increase their cover-age rates. For example, possible reasons put forward for the relatively low vaccination rates in Austria include poor public awareness, inadequate insurance coverage of related costs and lack of consensus within the Austrian medical profession about the importance of vaccination (Kunze et al. , 2007). Particularly virulent strains of the virus, similar to theH5N1 avian influenza subtype, can cause pandemics with a much wider impact than seasonal influenza. The impact of influenza not just on the health ofpeople but also on economic activity has been demon- strated again by the H1N1 epidemic (also referred to as \"swine flu\"). Although the economic impact of the H1N1 epidemic has not been fully assessed, the World Bank estimated in 2008 that a severe flu pandemiccould cost the global economy up to 4.8% of world domestic product (Burns et al. , 2008). The WHO reports that vaccines are one of the mostvaluable ways to protect people during influenza epidemics and pandemics. Other measures include anti-viral and other drugs, social distancing and personal hygiene. Although established national infra- structure and processes for seasonal vaccination programmes can signal an enhanced preparedness to respond to an influenza outbreak, the best scientific evidence suggests that the seasonal influenza vaccines that are routinely provided across OECD countries offer little or no protection against influenza A (H1N1). The development and distribution of effective vaccines takes more than six months (WHO, 2009b). Definition and deviations Influenza vaccination rate refers to the number of people aged 65 and older who have received an annual influenza vaccination, divided by the total number of people over 65 years of age. The main limitation in terms of data comparability arises from the use of different data sources,whether survey or programme, which are sus- ceptible to different types of errors and biases. For example, data from population surveys may reflect some variation due to recall errors and irregularity of administration.5.

ACCESS TO CARE Introduction This edition of Health at a Glance introduces a chapter on access to health care, building on recent OECD work in this area (de Looper an d Lafortune, 2009). Ensuring adequate access to essential health care services on the basis of individual need is an important health policy goal in all OECD countries. Monitoring health care access is, therefore, an important dimension in assessing the performance of health care systems. Health care access can be defined as an individual's ability to obtain appropriate health care services (Academy Health, 2004). Potential barr iers to access include: financial barriers (not being able to afford the costs of care), geogra phic barriers (not having enough health care providers in a particular geographic area or exce ssive travelling distance to providers), racial, cultural and information barriers (including lang uage problems) and barriers in terms of timely access (excessive waiting time to see providers). The indicators presented in this chapter relate only to financial and geographic barriers to health care. In most cases, the information do es not cover all countries and some indicators require more recent data. Further work will be needed to provide a more complete and up-to-date picture in future editions, through collaboration with national experts and data correspondents. No information is provided on waiting times for different services. The OECD is planning to update the earlier information that was reported on waiting times for a set ofelective surgeries (Siciliani and Hurst, 2003), as well as to broaden the data collection effort to measure waiting for other health services. This wo rk is expected to enri ch the content of this chapter in future editions of Health at a Glance . In looking at financial barriers to care, the indicators that are presented focus on inequalities by income groups. However, the availability of comparable data for some indicatorsis limited. For instance, it was only possible to gather data on the shar e of out-of-pocket health expenditure by income groups (Indicator 6.3) for a minority of countries. This chapter looks at access to both medical and dental care. It begins with a review of the available data on self-reported unmet needs for medical and dental care (Indicator 6.1), as a broad measure of access problems. It is a subjective measure, in the sense that it reflects the opinion of individuals on their needs and the degree to which they are met. Individual responses to survey questions on unmet care needs may be affected by recent policy changes and bycultural factors. It is therefore important to l ook at results of self-reported unmet care needs along with other indicators of access, such as th e degree of public or private health insurance coverage (Indicator 6.2) and the burden of out- of-pocket payments (Indicator 6.3) in order to obtain a more complete assessment of heal th care access in different countries. Geographic access to care is measured by the \"density\" of doctors in different regions within each country (Indicator 6.4). A frequent pr oblem in many OECD countries is that doctors tend to concentrate in urban centres, creating access problems for people living in rural and remote areas. However, it has only been possi ble to collect specific data on the number of doctors practising in urban and rural areas for a few countries, and even within that group of countries, there are differences in how urban and rural regions are defined.6. ACCESS TO CARE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 141Introduction One approach to measure inequalities in access is to measure inequalities in the actual use of health services for different population gr oups, taking into account differences in need, where applicable and possible. The last three indica tors in this chapter look at the use of doctors and dentists and in recommended screening for cancer by socio-economic status (mainly by income group). The indicators rely on data publ ished in an earlier OECD study (van Doorslaer et al., 2004), as well as data gathered by WHO (WHO, 2008b). Much of the information on utilisation rates, however, is derived from studies published some time ago, although efforts to collect more recent data for certain countries generally confirm earlier findings. More generally, the data used for the indicators are sourced from OECD Health Data , and other relevant national and cross-national data surveys and collections.HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1426. ACCESS TO CARE 6.1. Unmet health care needs Most OECD countries aim to provide equal access to health care for people in equal need. One method of gauging equity of access to services is through assess- ing reports of unmet needs for health care for some reason. The problems that patients report in getting care when they are ill or injured often reflect signifi- cant barriers to care. Some common reasons that people give for unmet care include excessive treatment costs, long waiting times in order to receive care, not being able to take time off work or caring for children or others, or that they had to travel too far to receive care. The differentlevels of self-reported unmet care needs across coun- tries could be due to differences in survey questions, socio-cultural reasons, and also because of reactions to current national health care debates. However,these factors should play a lesser role in explaining any differences in unmet ca re needs among different population groups within each country . It is also important to look at indicators of self-reported unmet care needs in conjunction with other indicators of potential barriers to access, such as the extent of health insurance coverage and out-of-pocket payments (Indicators 6.2 and 6.3). In most OECD countries, a majority of the population report no unmet care needs. However , in a European survey undertaken in 2007, a significant proportion of the population in some countries reported having unmet needs for medical care during the previous year. Generally, more women than men reported not getting the care they needed, as did people in low- income groups. Three possible reasons th at might lead to access problems are presented in Figure 6.1.1. In almost all countries, the most common reason given for unmet medical care is treatment cost. This was especially so in Portugal, Poland, Italy and Greece, and persons in the lowest income quintile we re most affected. Waiting times were an issue for respondents in Italy, Poland,Sweden and the United Kingdom, and affected both higher and lower income persons. Travelling distance did not feature as a major problem, except in Norway, where one-third of those in dicating that they had an unmet care need said that it was because of the distance they had to travel to receive care. A larger proportion of the population reports unmetneeds for dental care than for medical care. Poland (7.5%), Italy (6.7%) and Ic eland (6.5%) reported the highest rates in 2007 (Figure 6.1.2). Large inequalitiesin unmet dental care needs were evident between high and low income groups in Iceland, Greece, Portugal and Denmark, as well as in Belgium, although in the latter country, average levels of unmet dental care were low.Inequalities in self-reported unmet medical and dental care needs are also evident in non-European countries, based on the results of another multi-country survey (Figures 6.1.3 and 6.1.4). Again, fore- gone care due to costs is more prevalent among lower income groups for a number of different treatments. There are large differences in the size of these inequalities across countries, as shown by much lower levels in the Netherlands and United Kingdom than in the United States. In the Un ited States, more than half the adult population with below-average incomesreported having some type of unmet care need due to cost in 2007 (Commonwealth Fund, 2008). Those adults with below-average incomes who have health insurance report significantly less access problems due to cost than do their uninsured counterparts(Blendon et al. , 2002). Definition and deviations Questions on unmet health care needs are a fea- ture of a number of national and cross-national health interview surveys, including the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) and the international health policy surveys conducted by the Commonwealth Fund. No single survey or study on unmet care needs has been conducted across all OECD countries. In order to determine unmet medical care, individuals are typically asked questions to determine whether there was a time in the previous 12 months when they felt they needed health care services but did not receive them, followed by a question to determine why the need for care was unmet. Common reasons given include that care was too expensive, the travelling distance to receive care was too far, or that the waiting list for care was too long. Information on both unmet care and socio- economic status are derived from the same survey, although specific questions and answers,along with age groups surveyed and the measures used to grade socio-economic status can vary across surveys and countries. Cultural factors and changes to national health care systems may also affect attitudes to unmet care. Caution is therefore n eeded in comparing the magnitude of inequalities across countries.6.

ACCESS TO CARE 6.2. Coverage for health care Health care coverage promotes access to medical goods and services, providing financial security against unexpected or serious illness, as well as improved accessibility to treatments and services (OECD, 2004c). Total population coverage (both public and private) is, however, an imperfect indicator of accessibility, since this depends on the services included and on the degree of cost-sharing applied to those services. By 2007, most OECD countries had achieved universal or near universal coverage of health care costs for a \"core\" set of services (Figure 6.2.1). Generally, services such as dental care and pharmaceutical drugs are par- tially covered, but there are a number of countrieswhere these services must be purchased separately (see Annex Table A.5). Three OECD countries do not have universal health coverage. In Mexico, only half of the population was covered by public health insurance in 2002. The \"Seguro Popular\" voluntary health insurance scheme was introduced in 2004 to provide coverage for the poor and uninsured, and has grown rapidly, so that by 2007 over 80% of the population were covered. The Mexican government aims to achieve universal cover- age by 2011. Public coverage in Turkey was available for only two-thirds of the population in 2003, although recent legislation has introduced universal coverage (OECD and World Bank, 2008). In the United States, coverage is provided mainly through private health insurance, and 58% of the total population had this in 2007. Publically financed cover- age insured 27% of the tota l population (the elderly, people with low income or with disabilities), leaving15% of the population (45 million people under 65 years of age) without health coverage. Of these, more than one-half cite the cost of premiums as the reason for their lack of coverage (NCHS, 2009). Recent rises in the proportion of uninsured persons have been attributed to employ ers, particularly smaller ones, being less likely to offer coverage to workers, and to the increasing cost of premiums (OECD, 2008c). The problem of persistent uninsurance is seen as a major barrier to receiving health care, and more broadly, to reducing health inequalities among popu- lation groups (AHRQ, 2008a; HHS Office of HealthReform, 2009). Basic primary health coverage, whether provided through public or private insurance, generally covers a defined \"basket\" of benefits, in many cases with cost- sharing. In some countries, additional health coverage can be purchased through private insurance. Among26 OECD countries, seven (Netherlands, France, Belgium, Canada, United States, Luxembourg andIreland) report private coverage for over half of thepopulation in 2007 (Figure 6.2.2). In the Netherlands, the government implemented a mandatory universal health insurance scheme in 2006, with regulated competition across private in surers, thereby eliminat- ing the division between public and private insurancefor basic population cover. Private health insurance offers 88% of the French popu- lation complementary insurance to cover cost-sharing in the social security system. The Netherlands has thelargest supplementary market (92% of the population), followed by Canada (67%) whereby private insurancepays for prescription drugs and dental care that are not publicly reimbursed. Approximately one-third of theAustrian and Swiss populations also have supplemen- tary health insurance. Duplicate markets providing faster private-sector access to medical services wherethere are waiting times in public systems are largest in Ireland (51%), Australia (44%) and New Zealand (33%). The population covered by private health insurance is positively correlated to the share of total health spending accounted for by private health insurance (Figure 6.2.3). The importance of private health insurance is not linked to a countries' economic development. Other factors are more likely to explain market develop- ment, including gaps in access to publicly financed services, the way private providers are financed, government interventions directed at private health insurance markets, and historical development (OECD, 2004b). Definition and deviations Population coverage is the share of the popula- tion receiving a defined se t of health care goods and services under public programmes andprivate health insurance. It includes those covered in their own name and their depen- dents. Public coverage refers both to government programmes, generally financed by taxation, and social health insurance, generally financed by payroll taxes. Take-up of private health insur- ance is often voluntary, although it may be mandatory by law or compulsory for employees as part of their working conditions. Premiums are generally non-income-related, although the purchase of private cover can be subsidised by the government.6.

ACCESS TO CARE 6.3. Burden of out-of-pocket health expenditure Financial protection through public or private health insurance substantially reduces the amount that people pay directly for medical care, yet in some coun- tries the burden of out-of -pocket spending can still create barriers to health care access and use. House-holds that have difficulties paying medical bills may delay or forgo needed health care (Hoffman et al. , 2005; May and Cunningham, in Banthin et al. , 2008). On average across OECD co untries, 18% of health spending is paid directly by patients (see Indicator 7.6\"Financing of health care\"). In contrast to publicly-funded care, out-of-pocket payments rely on the ability to pay. If the financing of health care becomes more dependent on out-of-pocket payments, its burden is, in theory, shifted towards those who use services more, possibly from high to low income earners, where health care needs are higher. In practice, many countries have exemptions and caps to out-of-pocket payments for lower income groups to protect health care access. Switzerland, for example, has a high proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure, but it has cost-sharing exemptions for large families, social-assistance beneficiaries and others. There is an annual cap on deductibles and co-insurance payments (OECD and WHO, 2006). The burden of out-of-pocke t health spending can be measured either by its share of total household income or its share of total ho usehold consum ption. The average share varied considerably across OECDcountries in 2007, representing less than 2% of total household consumption in countries such as the Netherlands and France, but almost 6% in Switzerland and Greece (Figure 6.3.1). The United States, with almost3% of consumption being spent on out-of-pocket health services, is close to the average. In 2007, 30% of US adults paid more than USD 1 000 in out-of-pocket medical costs over the past year, while only 4% of UK adults paid similar amounts (Figure 6.3.2). In some central and eastern European countries, the practice of unofficial supplementary payments means that the level of out-of-pocket spending may be underestimated. The distribution of spending across the population can vary markedly , although data is only available for a small number of countries. The US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that 28% of Americans living in a poor family (defined as a family income below the Federal poverty level) were spending more than 10% of their after-tax family income for health services and health insurance premiums in 2004, compared with 10% of Americans in a high income family (Banthin et al. , 2008). Similarly, 5% of Belgian households in the lowestincome decile spent more than 10% of their gross income on out-of-pocket payments in 1997, compared to less than 1% of households in the highest decile (De Graeve and Van Ourti, 2003). In 2004, households in the lowest income quartile in the Netherlands spent 3.4% of their disposable income on out-of-pocket payments; in the highest quartile this was 2% (Westert et al. , 2008). A small proportion of households in OECD countriesface \"catastrophic\" health expenditure each year, perhaps as a result of severe illness or major injury. Catastrophic health expenditure is commonly defined as payments for health services exceeding 40% of household disposable income after subsistence needsare met (Xu et al. , 2007). Countries that have a greater reliance on out-of-pocket health care expenditure tendalso to have a higher proportion of households with catastrophic expenditure (Figure 6.3.3). In Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United States, rates of catastrophic spending exceed five per 1 000 people (Xu et al. , 2007). In Mexico, the high level of out-of-pocket spending resulted in 3. 4% of households having catastrophic health expenditure in 2003; among the lowest income quintile this rose to 4.7%, and amonguninsured persons it was 5.1% (OECD, 2005c). In some countries, the imposition of user fees may mean that lower income households forgo health care altogether, and thus not use enough services to incur catastrophic expenditures. Definition and deviations Out-of-pocket payments are expenditures borne directly by a patient where insurance does notcover the full cost of the health good or service. They include cost-shari ng, self-medication and other expenditure paid directly by privatehouseholds. In some countries they also include estimations of informal payments to health careproviders. Some households face very high out-of-pocket payments. Catastrophic health expenditure is commonly defined as payments for health services exceeding 40% of household disposable income after subsistence needs are met. Information on of out-of-pocket expenditure is collected through household expenditure surveys in a number of OECD countries.6.

ACCESS TO CARE 6.4. Geographic distribution of doctors Access to medical care requires an adequate number and proper distribution of physicians across the country. Shortages of physicians in a geographicregion can lead to increased travel times for patients and higher caseloads for doctors, which may result in increased waiting times to receive care. Measuring disparities in the \"density\" of physicians among regions within the same country gives some indica- tion of the accessibility of doctor services. Regions, however, may contain a mixture of urban and rural populations, so that although a region may have high physician density, persons living in geographically remote areas of that region may still face long travel times to receive medical care. In addition, the services that physicians offer should match need, whether these are for GPs or specialists. OECD countries display very different levels in the number of practising phys icians per 1 000 population, ranging from lows of less than two in Turkey, Koreaand Mexico, to highs of four and more in Belgium and Greece (see Figure 3.2.1 for Indicator 3.2 \"Practising physicians\"). In many countries, there is a greater number of physi- cians per capita in the nati onal capital than in other regions (Figure 6.4.1). In the Czech Republic forexample, Prague has a density of physicians almost twice the country average. The regional distribution of physicians is fairly even in Japan and Poland (OECD, 2009e). There is also disp arity in the density of specialists, with a greate r concentration evident in capital cities in a number of countries, such as Mexico, the Slovak Republic and Turkey (Figure 6.4.2). The density of physicians is greater in regions with a high urban population, due to the concentration of services such as surgery an d specialised practitioners in metropolitan centres (Figure 6.4.3). In Canada, justunder 16% of \"family physicians\" (mostly general practitioners) and only 2% of specialists were located in rural areas and small towns in 2006, whereas 24% of the population resided in these areas (Dumont et al. , 2008). In the United States, 17% of the population livedin non-metropolitan area s in 2004, but only 9% of practising patient care physicians were located inthese areas. There also tends to be fewer specialists outside cities - almost 50% of US counties had no obstetricians or gynaecologists providing direct patient care in 2004 (NCHS, 2007). The situation is similar in France, with 22% of general practitioners and 4% of specialists practising in towns of up to 10 000 population in 2007, whereas 36% of the popula- tion resided in these areas (DREES, 2008).In Australia, primary care physicians (mostly generalpractitioners) are fairly evenly distributed, ranging from an estimated 100 full-time equivalent per 100 000 population in major cities in 2005, to 88 in inner regional, 84 in outer regional and 92 in remote/ very remote regions. Specialists, however, ranged from 122 in major cities, to 56 in inner regional, 38 in outer regional and only 16 in remote/very remote regions (AIHW, 2008c). A number of factors are likely to affect the distribution of physicians. These includ e the population size and economic development of a region, the regions' pro- fessional climate and the extent of social amenities in a region (Huber et al. , 2008). Experience shows that a mix of policies are needed to address maldistribution is sues (Simoens and Hurst, 2006). In Canada, for example, foreign-trained doctorscomprised an average of 30% of the labour force in rural and remote areas in 2006. Incentives have also been developed to train health professionals with rural background and exposure (Dumont et al. , 2008). In Turkey, significant numbers of new health staffhave been assigned to areas with low physician density in recent years, although the challenge remains to match staff with areas of greatest need (OECD and the World Bank, 2008). Definition and deviations Practising physicians include general practitio-ners and specialists who are actively practising medicine. For more detail, see Indicator 3.2 \"Practising physicians\". Since countries use a variety of different geo- graphical classifications, the OECD has classified regions within each member country into twoterritorial levels. The higher level (Territorial Level 2) consists of 335 large regions within the 30 member countries. Fo r the most part, these correspond to national administrative regions. Further sub-regional analysis may be necessary to obtain a more complete picture of geographic distribution of physicians. A number of coun- tries have developed schemes to classify popu- lations into urban-rural categories, although these are not standard, making cross-national comparisons difficult.6.

ACCESS TO CARE 6.5. Inequalities in doctor consultations Measuring rates of health care utilisation, such as doctor consultations, is one way of identifying whether there are access prob lems for certain popula- tions. Difficulties in consulting doctors because ofexcess cost, long waiting periods or travelling time, lack of knowledge or incentive may lead to lower utilisation, and in turn to poorer health status and increased health inequalities. The average number of consultations per capita varies greatly across OECD countries (see Indicator 4.1 \"Consultations with doctors\"). But there are also significant differences among population groups within countries. One dimension that is often used to examine these variations is socio-economic status, asdetermined by income, education, or occupation. A study by van Doorslaer et al. (2004) examined income- related inequality in visits to doctors in a number of OECD countries around the year 2000. After adjusting for differences in need for health care (since health problems are more frequent and more severe among people from lower socio-economic groups), doctor visits were found to be more frequent among higher income persons in nine out of 21 countries - Canada, Finland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United States - but the degree of inequity was fairly small. In the other 12 OECD countries, given the same need, high income people were as likely to see a doctor as those with low income. A similar study using 1998 data found income-related equity for doctor visits in Korea (Lu et al. , 2007). For a majority of countries in the study, data were avail-able for both GP and specialist visits. GP visits were equitably distributed in most countries, and when significant inequity existed it was often negative, favouring low income earners (Figure 6.5.1). However, a different story emerged for specialist visits - in nearly all countries, high income people were more likely to see a specialist than those with low income (Figure 6.5.2), and in most countries also more fre- quently (van Doorslaer et al. , 2004; 2008). In Europe, this was especially so in Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Italy,four countries where private insurance and direct pri- vate payments played an important role in accessing specialist services. In Finland, the sources of these socio-economic differences in specialist visits include the size of patient co-payments, the pro-high income distribution of workplace se rvices that facilitate access to specialist care, and the large private ambulatory caresector (NOMESCO, 2004; OECD, 2005b). Consistent with these findings, research in 13 European countries has found that, after control-ling for need, people with higher education levels tendto use specialist care more, and the same was true for GP use in several countries (including France, Portugal and Hungary) (Or et al. , 2008). The study suggests that, beyond the direct cost of care, other health systemcharacteristics are important in reducing social ineq- uities in health care utilisation, such as the role given to the GP and the organisation of primary care. Social inequalities in specialist use were found to be less in countries with a National Health System and where GPs act as gatekeepers. Countries with established primary care networks may place greater emphasis on meeting the care needs of deprived populations, and gatekeeping often provides simpler access and better guidance for people in lower socio-economic posi- tions (Or et al. , 2008). A more recent study from Canada for 2003 confirmed that higher income persons had inequitably higher rates of GP and specialist consultations (Allin, 2006). On the other hand, no significant differences in theuse of GP or specialist ca re was found between people with higher and lower education levels in theNetherlands in 2005 (Westert et al. , 2008). Definition and deviations Consultations with doctors refer to the number ofambulatory contacts with physicians (both gener- alists and specialists). For more information, seeIndicator 4.1 \"Consultat ions with doctors\". Estimates in studies by van Doorslaer et al. (2004) and Or et al. (2008) come from health interview or household surveys conducted around 2000, andrely on self-report. Inequalities in doctor consul- tations are assessed in terms of people's income and educational level. The number of doctor consultations is adjusted for need, based on self- reported information about health status. Differing survey questions and response catego- ries may affect the ability to make valid cross- national comparisons. Surveyed groups may vary in age range, and the measures used to grade income and education level can also vary. Caution is therefore n eeded when interpreting inequalities in health care utilisation acrosscountries.6. ACCESS TO CARE HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1516.5.

Inequalities in dentist consultations Dental caries, periodontal (gum) disease and tooth loss are common problems in OECD countries, variously affecting almost all adults and 60-90% of school children (see Indicator 1.10 \"Dental health among children\"). Despite great improvements problems persist, occurring most commonly among disadvantaged and low income groups. In the United States for example, almost 50% of low income persons aged 20-64 years had untreated dental caries in 2001-04, compared with only 20% of high income persons (NCHS, 2009). In Finland, one- quarter of adults with lower education were found to have six or more missing teeth, while less than 10% of those with higher educatio n had the same amount of tooth loss (Kaikkonen, 2007). Strategies to improve access to dental care for disad- vantaged or underserviced populations include reducing financial and non-financial barriers, and promoting an adequate dental workforce in all regions to respond to demand. In most OECD countries, public health authorities recommend an annual visit to a dentist. The average number of per capita consultations with dentists varied widely in 2007, from over three in Japan and over two in Belgium, to 0.2 in Turkey (2002) and 0.1 in Mexico, with an OECD average of 1.3 (Figure 6.6.1). Some of this variation can be explained by the differ- ing availability of dentists. In general, as the numberof dentists increases, so do es the number of consulta- tions per capita (see Indicator 3.11 \"Dentists\"). Van Doorslaer et al. (2004) found that high income persons were more likely to visit a dentist within the last 12 months, in all OECD countries where data were available (Figure 6.6.2). This was despite differences in public and private dental coverage and the amount of reimbursement. There was, however, wide variation. At the time of this study, inequalities were smaller in countries with a higher probability of a dental visitsuch as Sweden and the Netherlands, and larger in Portugal, the United Stat es, Finland and Canada. Sweden was the most equitable country for the prob-ability of a dental visit. Dental care is largely subsi- dised through a national dental insurance system. Free care is provided for children and young people to age 19, and a number of services, including prosthetic treatment, are fully subsidised for older people. Reforms in July 2008 have extended care by introduc- ing vouchers for people aged 20 years and over, as well as a high-cost protection scheme. In 2006, Sweden spent 3.4% of public expenditure on health on dental services, well ahead of the OECD average of 2.5%.In the United States, more recent data confirms the wide differences between income groups in the prob- ability of a dental visit. Less than half of poor and near-poor persons visited a dentist in 2006 compared with 70% of middle and high income persons. This gap has remained largely unchanged over the past decade (Figure 6.6.3). As in many other countries, financial access to dental care in the United States is generally more difficult than for medical care, since a smaller proportion of persons have dental insurance. In 2001, only 61% of American adults had some form of dental insurance, compared to 86% of adults with medical insurance. On average in 2003, one-half of total dental care costs were paid out-of-pocket (NCHS, 2007), and more adults report that they did not get needed dental care due to costs than medical care (see Indicator 6.1 \"Unmet health care needs\"). Oral health care is mostly provided by private dental practitioners. Treatment is costly, averaging 6% of total health expenditure (and 16% of private health expenditure) across OECD countries in 2006. In countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand, adult dental care is not part of the basic packages of services which is included in public care insurance. In other countries, prevention and treatment are covered, but a varying share of costs is born by patients, and this may create access problems for low- income groups (Figure 6.6.4). Some countries, such as the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom, provide public dental care, particularly to children and disad- vantaged groups. Definition and deviations Consultations with dentists refer to the proba-bility and the number of contacts with dentists. Estimates usually come from health interview or household surveys, and rely on self-report, although some countrie s provide administrative data. Inequalities in dental consultations arehere assessed in terms of people's income. Differing survey questions and response catego- ries may affect the ability to make valid cross- national comparisons. Surveyed groups may vary in age range, and the measures used to grade income level can also vary. Caution is therefore needed when interpreting inequalities across countries.6.

ACCESS TO CARE 6.7. Inequalities in cancer screening Cancer is the second most common cause of death in OECD countries, responsible for 27% of all deaths in 2006. Among women, brea st cancer is the most common form, accounting for 30% or more of new cases each year and 16% of cancer deaths in 2006. Cervical cancer accounts for an additional 5% of new cases, and 3% of female cancer deaths (see Indicator 1.5 \"Mortality from Cancer\"). The early detection of breast and cervical cancers through screening programmes has contributed significantly to increased survival rates and declines in mortality from these di seases, and many countries have opted to make screening widely available. Inmost countries, more than half of women in the targetage groups for screening have had a recent mammo- gram, and pelvic exam or Pap smear (see Indicator 5.7 \"Screening, survival and mortality for cervical cancer\" and Indicator 5.8 \"Screening, survival and mortality for breast cancer\"). Screening rates vary widely among women in different socio-economic groups in OECD countries (Figures 6.7.1 and 6.7.2). In the United States, low income women, women who are uninsured or receiving Medicaid (health insurance coverage for the poor, disabled or impoverished elderly) or women with lower educa- tional levels report much lower use of mammography and Pap smears (NCHS, 2009). Even in those countries where the practice is common, women in the lowest wealth quintiles are generally less likely to undergo screening (Gakidou et al. , 2008; WHO, 2008b). There are exceptions, with women in the lowest wealth quintilesin Luxembourg and the Netherlands as likely to have had a mammogram as those in higher wealth quintiles. The same is true regarding cervical cancer screening in the Czech Republic, Italy and the United Kingdom. Participation rates also vary by geographic regions (Figure 6.7.3). Some areas, such as the Northern Territory (Australia), and London (United Kingdom), exhibit significantly lower ra tes than do other regions within the country (AIHW, 2008a; NHSBSP, 2008). Thereasons for this are varied. In geographically isolated regions, travelling distance and number of available screening facilities play a part. In inner urban areas, low levels of awareness of screening programmes, symptoms and risks are a concern among women who are poor, or from minority ethnic groups. A number of socio-economic characteristics - such as income, ethnicity, younger ag e, higher level of educa- tion, employment status, residential area, marital status, having health insurance, good health status, having a usual source of care and use of other preven-tative services - are all impo rtant predictors of partic- ipation in screening. In Mexico, cervical cancer detection programmes have been in place for some time, but problems with access and coverage remain, especially among disadvantaged groups, so that almost half of women aged 50 years and over have not had a Pap test in the last two years (Couture et al. , 2008). In most OECD countries, however, income should not be a barrier to accessing screening mammography or Pap smears, since the services are provided free of charge, or at the cost of a doctor consultation. Since a wide range of screening practices and differ- ent access barriers exist across OECD countries, no single strategy will meet all needs in promoting greater and equal coverage (Gakidou et al. , 2008). In countries with sufficient health system capacity,increased screening can be encouraged by ensuring services are free, and are available where needed. Policies and interventions may need to be better targeted in order to overcome inequalities. As a com- plementary tool, the promise of new cancer prevent- ing vaccines also has important implications for resource-poor settings where maintaining screening programmes is challenging. Definition and deviations Breast and cervical scre ening participation rates measure the proportion of women of a given age who have variously received a recent mammo- gram, breast exam, Pap smear or pelvic exam. Information is generally derived from health surveys, or from screening programme adminis- trative data. For this indicator, rates by wealth quintiles were derived from health surveys of women aged 25-64 years (cervical) and 50-69 years (breast) who reported that they ha d been screened in the three years prior to the survey. Screening esti-mates based on self-reported health surveys should be used cautiously, since respondents tend to overestimate desirable behaviours. The data for geographic regions include women in target age groups who had participated in national screening programmes. Target age groups and screening periodicity may differ across countries.6.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING Introduction This chapter presents an overview of the ma in indicators and characteristics of health spending and financing across OECD countries. The discussion starts wi th a comparison of overall health spending in terms of per capita expenditure and in relation to other macroeconomic variables, such as GDP. Current levels of spending as well as trends over recent years ar e presented, taking into account the likely impact of the economic slowdown on future health spending. As well as indicators of total spending,the chapter also provides an analysis of the different types of health services and goods consumed across OECD countries, with a separate focus on pharmaceuticals as one of the main drivers of health spending growth over recent years. A new and important area included in this version of Health at a Glance is health care expenditure broken down according to patients' characteristics, or more particularly, disease conditions and age. Such analysis is key for health policy makers in order to show current resource allocation in the health care system. The information provided can play an important role in discussions concerning changing demogr aphics and disease patterns, as well as the modelling of future health care expenditures. Alon g with the allocation of health care spending, the chapter also addresses the question of \"where does the money come from?\", i.e. where the burden for paying for such goods and services li es. Finally, with the growth in medical tourism and international trade in health services, current levels and trends are examined in the light ofefforts to improve data availability and coverage to feed growing policy needs. Comparison of health expenditur e and financing across countries The vast majority of countries now produc e health spending data according to the boundaries and definitions proposed in the OECD manual A System of Health Accounts (OECD, 2000). The comparability of the functional brea kdown of health expenditure data has improved over recent years. However , limitations remain , as some countries have not yet implemented the SHA classifications and definitions. Even am ong those countries that are submitting data according to the SHA, the comparability of data may be less than optimal. For example, in-patient expenditure does not contain independ ent billing of physicians' fees for in-patient care in Canada and the United States. Different practices regarding the inclusion of long-termcare in health or social ex penditure are also a factor affecting data comparability. Regarding the functional breakd own of health expenditure presented in this publication, out-patient expenditure is used in a broad sens e to cover both out-patient care in a hospital setting as well as in the ambulatory sector. For further information, see the \"Note on General Comparability of Health Expenditure and Finance Data\" in OECD Health Data 2009 . Definition of he alth expenditure Total expenditure on health measures the fi nal consumption of health care goods and services plus capital investment in health care infrastructure. This includes spending by both public and private sources (inclu ding households) on medical serv ices and goods, public health and prevention programmes and administration. The following table lists the major expenditur e categories according to the International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) used in OECD Health Data 2009 and presented in this publication.7. HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 159Introduction Adjustment for differences in national currency Health expenditure based on national currency units can be used for comparing some indicators, such as the ratio of health expenditure to GDP and health spending growth rates over time. However, to make useful comparisons of he alth expenditure across countries at a given point in time, it is necessary to convert data fr om national currency units to a common currency, such as the US dollar (USD). It is also useful to take into account differences in the purchasing power of national currencies in each country. To calculate the conversion rate of national currencies into US dollar purchasing power parity (PPP), the same, fixe d basket of goods and services across different countrie s is priced in the national currency, and then converted to US dollars. For example, if an identical basket of goods and services cost 140 Canadian dollars (CAD) in Canada and USD 100 in the Un ited States, then the PPP conv ersion rate would be CAD 1.4 to USD 1. The economy-wide (GDP) PPPs are used as the most available and reliable conversion rates. These are based on a broad basket of goods and services, chosen to be representative of all economic activity. The use of economy-wide PPPs means that the resultin g variations in health expenditure across countries will reflect not only variations in the volume of health services, butalso any variations in the prices of health servic es relative to prices in the rest of the economy. With regard to imports and exports of health goods and services, data are expressed in US dollars converted at market exchange rates. Correcting data for price inflation T o make useful comparisons of real growth rates over time, it is necessary to deflate (i.e.remove inflation from) nominal health expenditure through the use of a suitable price index, and also to divide by the population, to derive real spending per capita. Due to the limitedavailability of reliable health price indices, an economy-wide (GDP) price index is used in this publication, at 2000 GDP price levels.ICHA code Description HC.1; HC.2 Services of curative a nd rehabilitative car e (in-patient, day ca re, out-patie nt and home ca re) HC.3 Services of lo ng-te rm nursing care (in-patient, day ca re and home ca re) HC.4 Ancillary services to health ca re HC.1-HC.4 Medical services HC.5 Medical good s dispensed to o utpatient s HC.1-HC.5 Total expenditure on personal health HC.6 Services of p revention and public health HC.7 Health admi nistration and health i nsurance HC.6 + HC.7 Total expenditure on collective health HC.1-HC.7 Total current expenditure on health HC.R.1 Capital fo rmatio n (Investment) in health ca re provide r institutions HC.1-HC.7 + HC.R.1 TOTAL EXPENDITURE ON HEALTHHEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1607. HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.1. Health expenditure per capita Differences in spending levels per capita reflect a wide array of market and social factors, as well as countries' diverse financing and organisational structures of their health systems. The United States continues to outspend all other OECD countries by a wide margin. In 2007, spending on health goods and services per person in the United States rose to USD 7 290 (Figure 7.1.1) - almost two and a half times the average of all OECD countries. Norway and Switzerland spend about two-thirds of the per capita level of the United States, but are still around 50% above the OECD average. Most of the northern and western European countries, together with Canada and Australia, spend between USD PPP 3 000 and 4 000, between 100% and 130% of the OECD average. Thosecountries spending below the OECD average include Mexico and Turkey, but also the southern and eastern European members of the OECD together with Korea. Japan also spends less on health than the average in OECD countries, despite its above-average per capita income. Figure 7.1.1 also shows the breakdown of per capita spending on health into public and private compo- nents (see also Indicator 7.6). The variation in the lev- els of public spending on health is similar to that observed for total spending on health. In general, the ranking according to per ca pita public expenditure remains comparable to that of total spending. Even if the private sector in the United States continues to play the dominant role in financing, public spendingon health per capita is still greater than that in most other OECD countries (with the exception of Norway and Luxembourg), because overall spending on health is much higher than in other countries. In Switzerland, a large pr oportion of health care financing comes from private sources, and its public spending on health as a share of GDP is lower than in certain other countries, although overall spending is higher. The opposite is true in Denmark where most health care is publically financed. Per capita health spending over 1997-2007 is esti- mated to have grown, in real terms, by 4.1% annually on average across the OECD (Figure 7.1.2, Table A.10). In many countries, the growth rate reached a peak around 2001-02 and slowed in more recent years. By comparison, average economic growth over this period was 2.6%, resulting in an increasing share of the economy devoted to health in most countries (Figure 7.1.3; see also Indicator 7.2). In general, the countries that have experienced the highest growth in health ex penditures per capita overthis period are those that had relatively low levels atthe beginning of the period. Health expenditure growth in Korea and Turkey, for example, has been more than twice the OECD average over the past ten years. Other countries, such as Ireland and the United Kingdom, pursued specific policy objectives to increase public spending on health, meaning that overall health spending has outpaced economic growth (Department of Health and Children, 2001; Secretary of State for Health, 2002). In Germany , health spending per capita increased, in real terms, by only 1.7% per year on average, reflecting the effect of cost-containment policies designed to achieve stable contribution rates by employers andemployees. These measures have included budget or spending caps for sectors or individual providers, introducing reference prices for pharmaceuticals and educational approaches to enhance generic and rational prescribing, reducing the number of hospital beds and restricting the number of high cost medical equipment, and introducing or increasing co-payments for certain services (Bus se and Riesberg, 2004). Definition and deviations Total expenditure on health measures the final consumption of health goods and services (i.e.current health expenditure) plus capital investment in health care infrastructure. Thisincludes spending by both public and private sources on medical services and goods, public health and prevention programmes and administration. Countries' health expenditures are converted to a common currency (US dollar) and adjusted to take account of the different purchasing power of the national currencies, in order to compare spending levels. Economy-wide (GDP) PPPs are used as the most available and reliable conversion rates. The growth rates presented in Figures 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 have been adjusted to take account of series breaks that are in most cases due to the implementation of the System of Health Accounts . To remove these breaks, the real growth in the year ofthe series break has been assumed to be the aver- age growth of the preceding and following years.7.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.2. Health expenditure in relation to GDP In 2007, OECD countries devo ted 8.9% of their GDP to health spending (Figure 7.2.1). Trends in the health spending to GDP ratio are the result of the combined effect of trends in both GDP and health expenditure. Apart from a few countries (Hungary and the Czech Republic), health spending grew more quickly than GDP over the last ten years (see Figure 7.1.3 under the previous indicator). This has resulted in a higher share of GDP allocated to health (Figure 7.2.3). The share of health expenditure to GDP is likely to increase further, following the recession that started in many countries in 2008 and became widespread in 2009. In 2007, the share of health spending to GDP ranged from less than 6% in T urkey and Mexico up to 16% ofGDP in the United States (Figure 7.2.1 and Table A.12). Following the United States were France (11.0%), Switzerland (10.8%), and Germany (10.4%). The share of public expenditure on health to GDP also varies from a high of 8.7% of GDP in France to lows of 3.7% and 2.7% of GDP in Korea and Mexico, respectively. In these two countries, health spending is almost evenly split between public and private financing. To make a more comprehensive assessment of health spending, the health spending to GDP ratio should be considered together with per capita health spending (see Indicator 7.1 \"Health expenditure per capita\"). Countries having a relatively high health spending to GDP ratio might have relatively low health expendi- ture per capita, and the converse also holds. For example, Austria and Portugal both spent approxi- mately 10% of their GDP on health; however, per capita spending (adjusted to USD PPP) was almost70% higher in Austria (Figure 7.1.1). Figure 7.2.4 shows a positive association between GDP per capita and health expenditure per capita across OECD countries. While there is an overall tendency for countries with higher GDP to spend a greater amounton health, there is wide variation since GDP is not the sole factor influencing health expenditure levels. The association is stronger among OECD countries with low GDP per capita than among countries with a higher GDP per capita. Even for countries with similar levels of GDP per capita there are substantial differ- ences in health expenditure at a given level of GDP. For example, despite Japan and Germany having similar GDP per capita, their health spending per capita differs considerably with Japan spending less than 75% of the level of Germany on health. The reduction in GDP, due to the economic downturn, may lead to rises in the health spending to GDP ratiosin the short term. There is little evidence that GDP changes have an impact on the level of health spend- ing in the short term. However, the experience ofsome OECD countries that have faced substantial recessions in the past 20 years is that health expendi- tures may be reduced in the following years. The health spending to GD P ratio does not accurately measure the relative magnitude of health goods and services consumed by individuals because, firstly, total health expenditure includes investments made by health providers, and secondly, GDP includes also net exports. A more refined measure of the relative importance of health spending is the share of health goods and services to all the goods and servicesconsumed by individuals in the economy, regardless of who paid for them. This ratio is notably higher than the total health expenditure to GDP ratio for all OECD countries (Figure 7.2.2). The average share of actual consumption allocated to health across OECD countries is almost 13%, with the vast majority of OECD countries devoting more than 10% of their consumption to health. Five countries (United States, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Norway and Austria) spent more than 15% on health in 2007. Definition and deviations Gross Domestic Product (GDP) = final consumption + gross capital formation + net exports. Actual final consumption of households includes goods and services used by households or the commu- nity to satisfy their individual needs. It includes final consumption expenditure of households, general government and non-profit institutions serving households. Differences in the relative positions of countries according to the ratio of total health expenditure to GDP and current health expenditure to actual final consumption expenditure are due to differ- ences in the level of investments (in the economy as a whole, and in the health sector), in the balance of foreign trade across countries, and in net income from abroad. These adjustments are significant for countries such as Luxembourg, Ireland and Norway.7. HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING HEALTH AT A GLANCE 2009: OECD INDICATORS \u00a9 OECD 2009 1637.2.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.3. Health expenditure by function The allocation of health sp ending across the different types of health services and medical goods is influ- enced by a range of factors, including the availability of resources such as hospital beds, physicians and access to new technology, the financial and institu- tional arrangements for health care delivery, as well as by national clinical guidelines and the disease bur- den within a country. In 2007, curative and rehabilitative care provided in either an in-patient (including day care) or out-patient setting accounted for 60% of current health spending on average across OECD countries (Figure 7.3.1). The ratio of in-patient to out-patient spending depends on the institutional arrangements for health care provi-sion. Austria and France, for example, report a rela- tively high proportion of expenditure for in-patient care (amounting to more than a third of total health spending) which is associated with a high level of hos- pital activity (see Indicator 4.4). Conversely, countriessuch as Portugal and Spain, with low levels of hospital activity, allocate less than a quarter of health care resources to in-patient care. Large differences remain between countries in their expenditure on lo ng-term care. Switzerland, Norway and Denmark, with established formal arrangementsfor elderly care, allocate up to a quarter of total health spending to long-term care. In Korea and Portugal,where care tends to be provided in more informal or family settings, the expenditure on long-term care occupies a much smaller share of total spending (OECD, 2005a). The other major category of health expenditure is on medical goods, mostly accounted for by pharmaceuti- cals (see Indicator 7.4). Al though over 20% on average, the share of health spending on medical goods can beas low as 11-13% in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway and Denmark, and as high as 36-38% in Hungary and the Slovak Republic. Curative-rehabilitative care covers not only medical services requiring hospitalisation, but also those services provided either as day care, or as an out- patient in hospitals, the ambulatory sector, or in a patient's own home. Changes in medical practice, new technologies and more efficient allocation of resources can all affect the balance between different types of care delivery. Day (ambulatory) surgery is one area that has been expanding in many OECD countries in recent years. The use of day surgery for procedures such as cataract removal (see Indicator 4.9) or hernia repairs may result in higher throughput and decreased unit costs. In many countries day care has accounted for anincreasing share of the total spending on curative carein recent years (Figure 7.3.2). There are, however, wide variations in spending - partly reflecting data limitations - but also national policies and regula- tions. In France, spending on day care now accounts for around 11% of curative care spending. By contrast,Germany, where day surgery in public hospitals was prohibited until the late 1990s (Castoro et al. , 2007), reported only 2% of curative care expenditure asservices of day care. Figure 7.3.3 shows the share of health expenditure allocated to public health and prevention activities. On average, OECD countrie s allocated 3% of their spending on health to a wi de range of activities such as vaccination programmes and public healthcampaigns on alcohol abuse and smoking. The wide variation reflects to a grea t extent the national organ- isation of prevention campaigns. Where such initia-tives are carried out at the primary care level, such as in Spain, the prevention function is not captured separately and may be included under the spending on curative care. Other countries adopting a more centralised approach to public health and prevention campaigns tend to be able to identify spending on such programmes. Definition and deviations The functional approach of the System of Health Accounts defines the boundaries of the health system. Total health expenditure consists of current health spending and investment. Cur- rent health expenditure comprises personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (public health services and health administration). Curative, rehabilitative and long-term care can also be classified by mode of production (in-patient, day care, out-patient and home care.) Factors limiting the comparability across coun- tries include estimations of long-term care expenditure. Also, in some cases, expenditure in hospitals is used as a proxy for in-patient care services, although hospital expenditure may include spending on out-patient, ancillary, and in some cases drug dispensing services (Orosz and Morgan, 2004).7.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.4. Pharmaceutical expenditure Spending on pharmaceuticals accounts for a signifi- cant proportion of total health spending in OECD countries. Increased consumption of pharmaceuticals due to the diffusion of new drugs and the ageing of populations (see Indica tor 4.10 \"Pharmaceutical consumption\") has been a major factor contributingto increased pharmaceutical expenditure and thus overall heath expenditure (OECD, 2008d). However, the relationship between pharmaceutical spending and total health spending is a complex one, in that increased expenditure on pharmaceuticals to tackle diseases may reduce the need for costly hospitalisa- tion and intervention now or in the future. The total pharmaceutical bill across OECD countries in 2007 is estimated to have reached more than USD 650 billion, accounting for around 15% of total health spending. Over the last ten years, average spending per capita on pharmaceuticals has risen by almost 50% in real terms. However , considerable variation in pharmaceutical spending can be observed, reflecting differences in volume, structure of consump- tion and pharmaceuticals pricing policies (Figure 7.4.1). In 2007, the United States spent the most per capita on pharmaceutical products, with spending of USD 878, compared with an OECD average of USD 461. The big pharmaceutical spenders af ter the United States were Canada and Greece. At the other end of the scale, Mexico spent just under USD PPP 200 per capita - less than a quarter of the US total. New Zealand and Polandalso feature as one of the lowest per capita spenders at just over 50% of the OECD average. The low spending in New Zealand may be partly explained by a regulatory system that promotes the use of generics and the use of single supplier tenders to help reduce pharmaceu- tical prices (OECD, 2008d). The public purse covers around 60% of pharmaceutical expenditure on average, much less than for physician and hospital services. This is due to higher co-payments for pharmaceuticals under public insurance schemes, ora lack of coverage for non- prescribed drugs and for pre- scribed drugs in some countries (see Table A.5 inAnnex A for further information on basic primary health insurance coverage of selected health services and goods). The share of public expenditure for pharma-ceutical drugs is the lowest in Mexico, at 21% in 2007, although it has increased over the past five years. In the United States and Canada, the public share is less than 40%, as private health insurance covers a large part of the bill. Public spending on prescription drugs in theUnited States increased in 2006, because of the intro- duction of the new Medicare drug programme for the elderly and the disabled. The public share of pharma- ceutical spending increased from 24% in 2005 to 31% by 2007, but remains the second lowest share among OECD countries. At the other end of the scale, Greece, which has the highest priv ate share of total health spending amongst the European countries, passes verylittle on in terms of user costs to the patient regarding pharmaceutical expenditure, with almost 80% funded out of public sources. Pharmaceutical spending a ccounted for 1.5% of GDP on average across OECD countries, ranging from below 1% in countries such as Norway, Denmark andNew Zealand, to more than 2% in Portugal, Greece, the Slovak Republic and Hungary (Figure 7.4.2). Over the last ten years, the average growth in pharma- ceutical spending has matched the growth in overall health spending, although different patterns emerge both between OECD countries and over time. Growth in pharmaceutical spending reached a peak in many countries between 1999 and 2001. Of the big pharma- ceutical spenders, the United States and Canada have continued to see growth in pharmaceutical spending significantly above the average of OECD countries, although recent figures show lower growth rates (Figure 7.4.3). A number of countries have attempted to curb the relentless growth in pharmaceutical spending through such measures as the promotion of generic prescribing in the case of France (F\u00e9nina et al. , 2008), or the introduction of cost sharing in the case of the Czech Republic (OECD, 2008a). Definition and deviations Pharmaceutical expenditure covers spending onprescription medicines and self-medication, often referred to as over-the-counter products, as well as other medical non-durable goods. It also includes pharmacists' remuneration when the latter is separate from the price of medi- cines. Pharmaceuticals consumed in hospitals are excluded.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.5. Expenditure by disease and age Attributing health care expenditure by disease and age is important for health policy makers in order to analyse resource allocations in the health care sys- tem. The information provided can play an important role in assessing the impact of ageing populations and changing disease patterns on spending. It can alsoprovide input into the modelling of future health care expenditures (Heijink et al. , 2006). Furthermore, the linking of health expenditures by disease to appro-priate measures of outputs ( e.g. hospital discharges by disease) and outcomes ( e.g. survival rates after heart attack or cancer) can provide useful input in monitor- ing the performance of health care systems at a disease-based level (AIHW, 2005). Consistent \"functionally defi ned\" boundaries of health care spending and an accepted methodology for expen- diture allocation are necessary for the production of comparative estimates of expenditure by disease. The data presented here come pr imarily from pilot studies in a number of OECD countries, supplemented by additional country data where similar methodologies have been used. There are si gnificant data limitations in allocating health expenditur e according to categories of disease, age and gender - espec ially in relation to house- hold expenditure and out-pa tient categories. In order to maximize the comparability between countries,the figures provide a breakdown of hospital in-patient care - an area where administrative records are gener- ally complete with the necessary diagnostic and patient information. Figure 7.5.1 shows the di stribution of hospital in-patient expenditure acco rding to six main diagnos- tic categories. The countries show similar patterns, with circulatory diseases, cancers and mental and behavioural disorders accounting for close to 40% of total hospital in-patient expenditure. The differences between countries can be influenced by many factors, including demographic structure and disease patterns, as well as institutional arrangements and clinical guidelines for treating different diseases. Hungary allocates almost a quarter of hospital in-patient expenditure to the treatment of circulatory disease; this is not surp rising since Hungary also reports the highest mortality rates among OECDcountries due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke (see Indicator 1.4 \"Mortality from heart disease and stroke\"). Those countries allocating less to circulatory disease, such as Australia and France, also report lower mortality rates from such diseases. The different cost patterns observed can be due to demographic factors. Figure 7.5.2 shows the relativeallocation of hospital spending across three broad age groups. The share of hospital expenditure allocated to an age group is shown as a ratio to the size of that population. As expected, the population aged 65 and above consumes proportionally much more of hospital resources than those aged between 15-64. Australia and Korea allocate the greatest share of hospital expenditure to the elderly population. The organisation of care between different health care providers, particularly for the elderly population, is a significant factor in determining the level and share of hospital expenditure allocated between age groups. For example, the higher rates in Korea may be explained by the use of acute care beds for long-term care treatment (Hurst, 2007). Figure 7.5.3 gives an indication of expenditure by hospital discharge for the two disease categories that consume the greatest shar e of hospital in-patient expenditure - circulatory disease and cancers. Forcirculatory disease, France, Germany and Sweden show the highest cost per discharge, while Sweden and Australia are highest for cancer treatment. Definition and deviations Expenditure by disease and age allocates currenthealth expenditure by dimensions of patient char- acteristics. Guidelines currently being developed propose disease categories according to ICD-10 (with a mapping to ICD-9). Expenditures are also linked to one or more of the SHA dimensions of function (HC), provider (HP) and financing agent (HF). To ensure comparability between countries, a common methodology is proposed advocating primarily a top-down, main diagnostic allocation of expenditures. The main comparability issues relate to the treatment of non-allo cated and non-disease- specific expenditures. In the former case this isdue to data limitations (often in out-patient and pharmaceutical expenditure) and in the latter case regarding some prevention and administra- tion expenditure. For more meaningful compari- sons a subset of expenditure can be used, such as in-patient care, where administrative records tend to be more complete.7.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.6. Financing of health care All OECD countries use a mix of public and private financing of health care, but to differing degrees. Public financing is confined to government revenues in countries where central and/or local governments are primarily responsible for financing health services directly ( e.g. Spain and Norway). It comprises both general government revenues and social contribu-tions in countries with social insurance based- funding (e.g. France and Germany). Private financing, on the other hand, covers households' out-of-pocketpayments (either direct or as co-payments), third- party payment arrangements effected through various forms of private health insurance, health services such as occupational health care directly provided by employers, and other direct benefits provided by charities and the like. Figure 7.6.1 shows the public share of health financing across OECD countries in 2007. The public sector is the main source of health financing in all OECD countries, apart from Mexico and the United States. On average, the public share of health spending was 73% in 2007, unchanged from 1990. In Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, the Nordic countr ies (except Finland), the United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland and New Zealand public financing accounted for more than 80% of all health expenditure. There has been a convergence ofthe public share of health spending among OECD coun- tries over recent decades. Many of those countries with a relatively high public share in the early 1990s, such as Poland and Hungary, have decreased their share, while other countries which historically had a relatively low level (e.g. Portugal, Turkey) have increased their public share, reflecting health system reforms and the expan-sion of public coverage. The fact that the health system is primarily public funded in most countries does not imply that the public sector plays the dominant role in every area of health care. Figure 7.6.2 shows the public share of financing separately for medical services and medical goods. The public sector plays a dominant role in paying for medical services in most countries (cover- ing 78% on average), although a further sub-division of medical services shows an increasingly important role of private financing in the area of out-patient services (Orosz and Morgan, 2004), especially dental care, where around two-thirds of spending comes from private sources. In the financing of medical goods, private payments also play an important role,most clearly in Mexico, Cana da, the United States and Poland. The size and composition of private financing for all health services and goods differs considerably acrosscountries. On average, more than two-thirds of private funding is accounted for by out-of-pocket payments (including any cost-sharing arrangements) (Colombo and Morgan, 2006). In some central and eastern European countries, the prac tice of unofficial supple- mentary payments means that the level of out-of-pocket spending is probably underestimated. Private health insurance is around 5-6% of total health expen- diture on average across OECD countries (Figure 7.6.3). For some countries, it plays a significant financing role. It provides primary coverage for certain popula- tion groups in Germany, and for a large proportion of the non-elderly population in the United States, where private health insurance accounts for 35% of health expenditure. In France and Canada, private health insurance finances 13% of overall spending,but provides respectively complementary and supple- mentary coverage in a public system with universal reach (see Indicator 6.2). In several countries, including the Netherlands and France, less than 2% of the total consumption of households was spent on out-of-pocket health services in 2007, while in Switzerland such spending represented more than 6% of total householdconsumption. In Korea and Mexico, it was 4-5% and the United States, with almost 3% of consumption being spent on out-of-pocket health services, was close to the OECD average. Definition and deviations There are three elements of health care financing:sources of funding (hou seholds, employers and the state), financing schemes ( e.g. compulsory or voluntary insurance), and financing agents (organ- isations managing the financing schemes). Here \"financing\" is used in the sense of financingschemes as defined in the System of Health Accounts . Public financing includes general govern- ment revenues and social security funds. Private financing covers households' out-of-pocket payments, private health insurance and otherprivate funds (NGOs and private corporations). Out-of-pocket payments are expenditures borne directly by the patient. They include cost- sharing and, in certain countries, estimations of informal payments to health care providers.7.

HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND FINANCING 7.7. Trade in health se rvices (medical tourism) International trade in health services and one of its main components, medical tourism, have been attracting increasing attention from health analysts, the medical profession, public health policy makers, and trade and tourism promotion agencies. Discus- sions on the opportunities and threats of such trade have been conducted with relatively little data toinform them. The only reasonably comparable and widely reported measure of trade in health services is the balance of payments item \"Health-related travel\". This item is defined as \"goods and servic es acquired by travellers going abroad travelling for medical reasons\". This def-inition corresponds quite well to the notion of medicaltourism. The concept has so me limitations in that it does not include medical ex penses of persons travel- ling for other reasons, and who happen to require medical services when abroad. Nor does it include health services provided cross-border such as medical laboratory services and telemedicine, or health services provided by medical personnel who go temporarily abroad. In the language of trade, exports of health-related travel from a reporting economy occur when domestic health service providers supply medical services to non-resident visitors travelling for medical reasons. Similarly, imports occur when residents of the reporting economy acquire medical services abroad from non-resident providers. Data for around half of OECD countries shows that total reported exports and imports of health-related travel each amounted to about USD 5billion in 2007. Due to definitional and meas urement issues, this is a significant underestimate. Nevertheless, it is clearthat, in comparison to the si ze of the health sector as a whole, medical tourism is marginal for most coun-tries, but growing. In the case of Germany, reported health-related travel imports represent 0.5% of Germany's current health expenditure. However, from 2004 to 2007, they grew on average at 13% a year. The United States is by far the largest exporter, reporting some USD 2.3 billion of exports in 2007 (Figure 7.7.1). The Czech Republic, Turkey, Belgium and Mexico all reported exports in excess of USD 300 million. T wenty-o ne OECD countries reported a total of USD 4.6 billion of health servicesimports, most in health-related travel in balance of payments sources and a few under the wider concept of imports of health care in the SHA data collection (Figure 7.7.2). Of these, Germany is by far the largest importer reporting some USD 1.5 billion of imports in 2007. The United States and Netherlands reportedimports of over USD 600 mi llion, while Canada and Belgium reported imports above USD 300 million. The rate of growth of OECD imports of health-related travel was significantly higher than exports, suggest- ing the increasing import ance of health services exported from non-OECD countries (Figures 7.7.3and 7.7.4). Despite increasing numbers of United States residents seeking treatment abroad, th e United States remains a net exporter of medical services - with a USD 1.7 billionsurplus in 2007. This export of health services includes visitors who suffer unexpected illness while in the United States (a wider definition than the one used in other countries), as well as international visitors, primarily from the Middle East, South America and Canada, coming with the express purpose of obtaining treatment. The motivations behind such inbound medi-cal tourism can vary. For example, a number of medical institutions actively market their services to affluent consumers from emerging countries to come to the United States for specialised high quality care, or for services unavailable in their native countries. Some medical tourists may want to avoid extended waiting times within their home country. Other consumers may combine business or leisure travel with a specialised medical demand. Interestingly, the growth in exports slowed in 2007, due in part to the increased establish- ment of commercial hospitals abroad by US medical institutions (USITC, 2009). Definition and deviations According to the Manual on Statistics of Interna- tional Trade in Services , \"Health-related travel\" is defined as \"goods and services acquired by travellers going abroad for medical reasons\". In the balance of payments, trade refers to goods and services transactions between residents and non-residents of an economy. The System of Health Accounts includes imports within current health expenditure, defined as imports of medical goods and services for final consumption. Of these the purchase of medical services and goods, by resident patients while abroad, is currently the most important in value terms. This trade is not well reported by many of the countries reporting health accounts accord- ing to the SHA.7.
