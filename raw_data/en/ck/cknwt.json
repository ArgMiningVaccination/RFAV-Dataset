DOI 10.1002/bit.24493 ABSTRACT: The evolution of vaccines (e.g., live attenuated, recombinant) and vaccine production methods (e.g., in ovo, cell culture) are intimately tied to each other. As vaccine technology has advanced, the methods to produce the vaccine have advanced and new vaccine opportunities have been created. These technologies will continue toevolve as we strive for safer and more immunogenic vaccines and as our understanding of biology improves. The evolu- tion of vaccine process technology has occurred in parallel to the remarkable growth in the development of therapeuticproteins as products; therefore, recent vaccine innovations can leverage the progress made in the broader biotechnology industry. Numerous important legacy vaccines are still in use today despite their traditional manufacturing processes, with further development focusing on improving stability (e.g., novel excipients) and updating formulation (e.g., combination vaccines) and delivery methods (e.g., skin patches). Modern vaccine development is currently exploit- ing a wide array of novel technologies to create safer and more efcacious vaccines including: viral vectors produced in animal cells, virus-like particles produced in yeast orinsect cells, polysaccharide conjugation to carrier proteins, DNA plasmids produced in E. coli , and therapeutic cancer vaccines created by in vitro activation of patient leukocytes. Purication advances (e.g., membrane adsorption, precipi-tation) are increasing efciency, innovative analytical methods (e.g., microsphere-based multiplex assays, RNA microarrays) are improving process understanding. Novel adjuvants such as monophosphoryl lipid A, which acts on antigen presenting cell toll-like receptors, are expanding the previously conservative list of widely accepted vaccine adju- vants. As in other areas of biotechnology, process charac- terization by sophisticated analysis is critical not only to improve yields, but also to determine the nal product quality. From a regulatory perspective, Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) are im- portant initiatives that can be applied effectively to many types of vaccine processes. Universal demand for vaccines requires that a manufacturer plan to supply tens and some- times hundreds of millions of doses per year at low cost. Toenable broader use, there is intense interest in improving temperature stability to allow for excursions from a rigid cold chain supply, especially at the point of vaccination. Finally, there is progress in novel routes of delivery to moveaway from the traditional intramuscular injection by culture; purication; formulation; manufacturing Introduction The earliest vaccines were relatively crude and consisted of partially puried live attenuated virus (e.g., smallpox,rabies) or inactivated bacteria (e.g., pertussis). Over time,more rened methods were introduced such as chemicaltreatment of a protein toxin to form a toxoid (e.g., tetanus, diphtheria), development of a puried and inactivated virus (e.g., hepatitis A), development of virus-like particles (e.g.,hepatitis B, human papillomavirus), and use of puriedpolysaccharides (e.g., pneumococcal vaccines). Vaccines cangenerally be classied as whole organism, puried macro-molecules, combined antigens, recombinant vectors,synthetic peptides, or DNA, and have been historicallyintroduced in approximately this order. As these vaccine types have evolved, the production processes to make them have had to evolve as well. A summary is given in Table I. The rst vaccines used whole live virus and human-to- human or animal-to-human transfer, such as EdwardJenner's cowpox (vaccinia) inoculation in 1796,intended to immunize against the more pathogenicsmallpox in humans. In fact, the word vaccination (Latin:vaccinus \u00bccow) originated from this rst vaccine since it was derived from a virus affecting cows (Dekleva, 1999). Production methods then advanced to live attenuated virus vaccines produced in vivo or in ovo. Bacterial vaccines were created by Louis Pasteur in the 1880s, including vaccines for chicken cholera and anthraxusing weakened bacterial cultures. The Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) was developedaround the same time (Bae et al., 2009). The pertussis whooping cough vaccine, licensed in 1918, was the rst Correspondence to: B. Buckland /C2232012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 109, No. 6, June, 2012 1443whole-cell inactivated bacterial vaccine. It was subsequently combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to make thecombination diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTwP) and is increasingly being replaced with an acellular subunit vaccine (DTaP) consisting of individualbacterial proteins (Rappuoli, 1990). Protein subunit and toxoid vaccines came about in the 1930s with the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, which consisted of bacterial toxinsinactivated with formalin. The rst in vitro cultivation of a viral vaccine was polio virus in non-neural human cells by Enders in 1949, followed by Salk's inactivated polio vaccine in primary monkey kidney cells in 1955. This marked the beginnings of themodern cell culture based industry (Aunins et al., 2000). Whole virus vaccines, such as the attenuated rabies vaccine, require specialized facilities for virus propagation and lland nish to ensure human safety. Due to the safety risksassociated with whole cell and whole virus vaccines, scientists began to create vaccines based on individual pathogen antigens. These subunit vaccines are potentiallysafer, but are often less immunogenic due to the absence ofother viral and cellular components. Polysaccharide vaccines typically contain polysaccharides from the surface of a bacterial capsid, such as in the subunit vaccine for typhoidand early versions of pneumococcal and meningococcalvaccines (14-valent in 1977 and 23-valent in 1983). Historically, vaccines have been developed using these conventional methods that follow the paradigm of isolating,sometimes inactivating, and injecting the disease-causingpathogen or pathogen component (Table II). Some of these methods are still used today for vaccines given to people throughout the world (Aunins et al., 2011). For example,the process used to make modern diphtheria or tetanusvaccines, based on bacterial toxoids, is a rened version of the one developed in the 1930s and the process used to make today's measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine wasdeveloped more than 30 years ago. For some of theseimportant vaccines, further process development is focused on troubleshooting any manufacturing issues, as well as formulation work to either combine with other vaccines(e.g., ProQuad 1\u00bcVaricella \u00feMMR) or to improve prod- uct stability (e.g., novel excipients) (Lightfoot andMoscariello, 2004). These products are generally not protected by patents, but the complexity of manufacturing and key analytics results in a high barrier to entry for newcompetitors. For other traditional vaccines, novel process approaches are being applied in order to further drive down cost. For example, a new Sabin-based inactivated poliovaccine is being developed to move away from Salk wild-type strains to the safer attenuated Sabin strains, allowing forprocess optimization including the application of modern purication methods (Bakker et al., 2011).

It is a different story for novel vaccines; there are major incentives for new vaccines to be more dened. Due to theglobal desire to avoid exposure to disease-causing organismsby both patients and manufacturers, recombinant expres- sion of proteins and viral vectors is the modern vaccine development method of choice to remove pathogens fromthe system. The advantages of subunit and recombinantvaccines include: virtual elimination of safety risks, vaccinefeasibility even with a difcult-to-cultivate virus, denedprocess components, more controlled bioprocesses, and ashorter production process (e.g., cell culture vs. egg) whichis critical for pandemic response (Buckland, 2005; Eisenstein, 2011). An example is Recombivax HB 1,a hepatitis B vaccine that was the rst licensed recombinantDNA vaccine. The original vaccine was made by purifyingvirus particles from infected blood; it was revolutionary tobe able to replace this with the inherently safe recombinantapproach of expressing hepatitis B surface antigen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Several new vaccine development approaches have come to the forefront over the last decade. Reverse vaccinology is an approach that uses genome analysis to identify thecomplete repertoire of antigens that immunogenic epitopes, once sequenced, are typically patented and evaluated for suitability in various vaccine formulations. An example is the influenza vaccines underdevelopment that are based on recombinant hemaglutinin protein antigens rather than on live attenuated virus. Systems biology is another approach that integrates multipleelds of study to explore the interactions between differentbiological systems. Using mathematical models to evaluatedata collected from various elds, such as transcriptomics,metabolomics, and proteomics, scientists can begin toelucidate the causes and effects in biological networks.This can lead to a greater understanding of how vaccine antigens interact with different components of the immune system. Using the above scientic approaches, rationallydesigned vaccines are created, often at the amino acidsequence level, to present antigens through specic intracellular pathways. Using similar techniques, ground-breaking new vaccines have been developed, such asGardasil 1and Cervarix1, effective against human papillo- ma virus (HPV) and associated cervical cancer. Despite these innovations, many other diseases continue to elude vaccinescientists. Pathogens with high-antigenic variability such as those formalaria, TB, and HIV, continue to cause human suffering.Developing effective and long-lasting vaccines for diseasessuch as these will continue to require new approaches tovaccine design and production (Rinaudo et al., 2009). This article focuses on the production, purication, analytical,formulation, and delivery innovations in the eld of vaccines that have surfaced over the last decade. Virus-Based Vaccines and Viral Vectors Many viral vaccines were originally produced in primary celllines, which are cells obtained directly from animal organs and tissues. Diploid cells are derived from primary cultures and can be serially passaged, although they retain theiranchorage dependence and limited lifespans (40-60passages) (Sureau, 1987). These characteristics make itdifcult to maintain a high cell density for a prolongedperiod of time, which leads to challenges in bioreactordesign, as was the case of the development of the VAQTA hepatitis A vaccine with diploid MRC-5 cells in roller bottles (Armstrong et al., 1993). Continuous cell lines originate from diploid cells that have undergone a chromosomal transformation to allowthem to divide indenitely. Those that can be used for theproduction of viral vaccines fall into two categories. The rstis conventional cell lines such as African green monkeykidney-derived Vero cells, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney(MDCK) cells, or PBS-1 cells (HepaLife Technologies, Boston, MA) that are grown either adherently in roller bottles, NUNC cell factories (Thermo Scientic, Roskilde,Denmark), or on microcarriers, or in suspension cultures instirred-tank bioreactors or disposable wave bioreactors. Thesecond category is proprietary human cell lines such asPER.C6 1(Johnson & Johnson, Leiden, the Netherlands), AGE1.CR1(ProBiogen, Berlin, Germany), and EB141 (Vivalis, Nantes, France) which are typically grown in suspension cultures in serum-free media (Genzel and Reichl, 2009). The Vero cell line was the rst continuous mammalian cell line, established from African green monkeys in 1962,and is currently the most widely accepted by regulatoryauthorizes for vaccine development due to the fact thatVero-derived human vaccines have been in use for nearly 30years. They can be grown and infected on microcarrier beads in large-scale fermenters (6,000 L reported) and in serum-free medium with no loss in productivity (Barrettet al., 2009). Several innovative vaccines produced inVero cells have been licensed including the smallpoxvaccine ACAM2000 1(Sano Lyon, France) and Whitehouse Station, NJ) and Rotarix1(GSK, Brentford, Middlesex, UK), all of which are live attenuated virus vaccines. Also produced from Vero cells is the H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine Preflucel1(Baxter, Deereld, IL) and the japanese encephalitis vaccine Ixiaro1(Intercell, Vienna, Austria), both produced from inactivated virus. Viral vectors allow simultaneous expression of multiple antigenic determinants while avoiding the safety risksassociated with the use of the whole pathogenic virus(Liniger et al., 2007). DNA viral vectors that have been used in antigenic delivery systems include poxviruses, Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology 1445 Biotechnology and Bioengineeringherpesvirus, and adenovirus, while RNA viral vectors, such as retrovirus and flavivirus, have been studied as well (Geelsand Ye, 2010). Viral vectors have the advantages of beingcapable of inducing both antibody and T-cell-mediatedimmunity in the absence of an adjuvant, do not requirecomplex purication development, may be able to generateantigens with native conformation, and may be able todeliver more than one gene (e.g., multiple antigens from different parasite life stages that could induce a broad protective immunity) (Li et al., 2007). Adenovirus vectors are one of the most promising gene delivery vectors for vaccines because they are efcient atdelivering DNA to target cells, have a large capacity for incorporation of cDNA expression cassettes, and have a lowpotential for oncogenesis because they do not insert theirgenome into the host DNA (Subramanian et al., 2007). Adenovirus have been produced in PER.C6 1, HEK293, and A549 cell lines, although PER.C61is the most common despite its limited number of generations. PER.C61cells can be grown adherently or in suspension culture, the latter having similar growth patterns in large bioreactors toChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, with the addedcomplication of an infection step during the exponentialgrowth phase. The challenge of growing a virus that was designed to be replication incompetent was solved using a metabolic engineering approach involving the deletion of the required E1 region from the virus and subsequentinsertion into the host cell line (Maranga et al., 2005; Singhand Kostarelos, 2009). The result is that the recombinantadenovirus replicates well in the specic host cell, but doesnot replicate after injection into the patient. A large-scale cell culture and infection process was developed at Merck for a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector expressing the HIV-1 gaggene in suspension PER.C6 1cells, as shown in Figure 1 (Xie et al., 2003). This process was scaled-up to 250 L under the worst-casesparging conditions projected for 10,000 L scale, which was the scale projected for implementation if this proposed HIV vaccine (p55 gagtransgene) was commercialized. The process includes a step for removal of polysorbate-80 surfactant and the addition of Pluronic F-68, a nonionic polymer that reduces cell damage incurred during sparging.In 2007, the same team developed a different process forproduction of rAd5 vectors in PER.C6 1cells that bypasses the virus cloning and passaging steps. This process involves transfection of adherent bacterially cloned adenovirus plasmid using calciumphosphate coprecipitation (Subramanian et al., 2007). The cells were grown and transfected in NUNC cell factories with a production level of >5/C210 10VP per NUNC tray, obtained 1 month from the time of plasmid construction. Few HIV preventative vaccine candidates have made it to Phase III trials and all have failed to prove satisfactoryefcacy. The rst was called AIDSVAX. VaxGen began trialsin Thailand AIDSVAX B/E in combination with theAventis Pasteur vaccine, ALVAC-HIV, which used genetic elements of several different HIV strains encapsulated in aharmless canarypox virus vector. Efcacy ranged from 26.1% to 31.4%, too low to be considered successful, but theresults are considered an important milestone. The secondPhase III vaccine candidate was the rAd5-based vaccinedeveloped by Merck. In the STEP and Phambili HIV trials,the vaccine failed to protect Ad5-seronegative individualsagainst infection and both trials were halted in September2007 (Iaccino et al., 2008). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and solvent extraction have both been around for some time and arestill key components in the purication of many viralvaccines. For example, they are both used in the puricationof the highly puried formalin-inactivated hepatitis Avaccine VAQTA (Merck), where and with chloroform causing irreversible denatur- ation of contaminant proteins at the interface, retaining viable hepatitis A virus in the aqueous phase (Hagen et al.,1997). During development of VAQTA, the PEG precipita-tion step was found to be sensitive to small changes ingrowth and harvest conditions. Additional developmentwork indicated that nucleic acids were aggregating duringthe membrane concentration step and were coprecipitatingwith the virus. These variable amounts of nucleic acids led to inconsistent virus recovery and product purity. The use of nuclease on the crude lysate decreased the molecular size of Figure 1. Adenovirus production process developed by Merck involving the infection of PER.C61mammalian cells with rAd5 viral vectors containing the HIV-1 p55 gag transgene.

Following the nuclease addition step with anionexchange chromatography (AEX) provided further optimi-zation in yield and purity, as well as enhanced processreproducibility (Hagen et al., 1996). Influenza Vaccines\u2014Evolution of Vaccine Production Processes The rst influenza vaccine was developed in 1937 as an inactivated whole virus vaccine. It has since progressed tolive attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) and puried splitvaccines, followed by a puried surface antigen vaccine, allproduced in fertilized eggs. The influenza vaccine has sinceevolved from this in ovo process that involves a long production time and limited capacity, to cell culture processes that are low-yielding and capital intensive, tonewer technologies such as recombinant antigens, VLPs, andthe use of advanced adjuvants such as Toll-Like Receptor(TLR) agonists (Price, 2011). This evolution continues to bedriven by the risk of an influenza pandemic, especially withtypes H5N1 and H1N1, and the overall vaccine demand hasroughly doubled since 2009 (Gregersen et al., 2011). Current estimates indicate that global spread could occur in 6 months, which is approximately the period required for in ovo vaccine production and the brief clinical studiesrequired in Europe (Hoare et al., 2005). Many countrieswithout virus-based vaccine capacity could not afford to putproduction facilities in place just for a possible pandemic.The newer recombinant vaccine technologies with shorterproduction timelines and/or based on platform technologies could be used to solve worldwide capacity issues. The influenza surface proteins and peptides of greatest current interest, shown in Figure 2A, include the hemaglu-tinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), core matrix 1 (M1), andcore matrix 2 (M2) domains (Amorij et al., 2008).Neutralizing and receptor-blocking antibodies against HAare the primary means of protection, while antibodiesagainst NA seem to play a secondary role. The seasonal human influenza vaccines currently licensed contain an inactivated split of H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viralantigens to promote HA and NA subtype and strain specicantibody protection (Barrett et al., 2009). There is little or noknown cross-protection against drifted strains withinsubtypes or to other subtypes (Bright, 2011). Cell culture based production of LAIV offers the advantages of shorter production cycles, greater process control, well-characterized production substrates, and providing larger quantities of vaccine in a shorter timeperiod (Aggarwal et al., 2011; George et al., 2010; Liu et al.,2009). The disadvantage is relatively low productivity and along virus adaptation period, which would be problematicduring a pandemic. The use of live virus also requires ahigher level of biosafety containment. The most common host cells used for influenza vaccines are MDCK cells that are grown and infected either onmicrocarrier beads or in suspension culture. MDCK cells demonstrate a high degree of robustness, are easily adaptedto different medium formulations, can tolerate a wide pHrange, and are less sensitive to aeration than other cell lines(Genzel and Reichl, 2009). There are currently two licensedseasonal influenza vaccines manufactured in MDCK cells.Abbott's (acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals in 2009) InfluvacTC 1was licensed in the Netherlands in 2001, while Novartis' Optaflu1was approved in the EU in 2007. Novartis also produces Celtura1based on the H1N1 strain for use in pandemics. Influvac TC1is produced in adherent culture, while Optaflu1and Celtura1are produced in suspension culture. Recombinant technologies will likely become the way of the future for influenza vaccines since the upstreamprocesses are fast compared to in ovo and cell culture production and due to the fact that they avoid the handling of live virus and the associated costly biosafety containment.A recombinant process would also allow for quick cloning ofa new strain and the use of non-specialized productionfacilities for surge capacity during a pandemic. The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is an excellent option for production of recombinant influenzavaccines, since it involves the infection of insect cells with baculovirus, which are inherently safe because they do not replicate in mammalian cells (Wang et al., 2006). Inaddition, virtually no known adventitious agents canreplicate in both insect cells and mammalian cells.Protein Sciences Flublok 1is the rst recombinant HA influenza vaccine (trivalent) produced in BEVS and iscurrently under review for approval in the USA. If approved,it would be the rst licensed recombinant influenza vaccine. Figure 2B shows the production process for Flublok 1, which involves standard cloning, cell culture, and purica-tion procedures (Cox, 2010; Cox and Hollister, 2009). TheHA gene from a new influenza virus is cloned directly into abaculovirus expression vector. The recombinant baculovirusis then used to infect insect cells in large-scale stirredbioreactors. Following protein expression, infected cells areharvested by centrifugation and the antigen is collected using detergent extraction. The HA is puried by two column chromatography steps and two ltration steps. Thetime from DNA sequence acquisition for a new influenzastrain to production of a rosette-shaped protein is rapidusing this technology. There are many similarities, bothupstream and downstream, between the Protein Science'sexpres SF (derived from Sf9 cells) insect cell process and a CHO-based antibody manufacturing process. This creates a plausible scenario in which an existing CHO-based facility could be used to make influenza vaccine, since the process isreadily scalable to large stirred tank bioreactors. Several other companies are developing recombinant influenza vaccines in standard expression systems as well.Novavax exploits several influenza surface antigens in itsVLP vaccine that is also produced in BEVS; it consists of aprotein shell decorated with HA, NA, and M1 antigens (Extance, 2011; Singhvi, 2010). The company VaxInnate Vaccine Process Technology 1447 Biotechnology and Bioengineeringuses recombinant E. coli to express HA in the form of a TLR agonist-antigen fusion protein, which has demonstratedstrong potency at a tenth of a standard human dose. TLRagonist-antigen fusion proteins mimic natural infection bysimultaneously presenting a TLR agonist and an antigen atthe same antigen-presenting cell (APC). The bacterial fermentation process requires approximately 3 weeks and can use existing prokaryotic manufacturing facilitiesglobally, allowing for fast surge capacity in response to apandemic (Shaw, 2006). Both Novavax and VaxInnate havereceived US government contracts from BARDA inFebruary 2011 totaling $215 million, which they will useto push their respective vaccines toward Phase III trials(Young, 2011). Other recombinant influenza vaccine approaches include HA delivered by a modied recombinant viral vector(Vaxin, Birmingham, AL) and a plasmid DNA vector (Pzer, New York, NY). Several universal vaccines based onthe M2e peptide (constant across all influenza strains) arealso under development, including two by Acambis/SanoPasteur and VaxInnate (Price, 2011). Conjugate Vaccines Conjugate vaccines combine a pathogen antigen with acarrier protein that lends additional immunogenicity to thevaccine. For example, the efcacy enhanced by covalently attaching (conjugating) the polysaccharides (PS) in the original Figure 2.

Typhoid vaccines based on the Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi were also improved by conjugation to several carrierproteins (Knuf et al., 2011; Thiem et Though these particular conjugate vaccines are non-recombinant and require fermentation of the original pathogens in a higher biosafety level facility, they represent an advance in vaccine technology. The PS vaccines stimulatebactericidal anticapsular antibodies, which give good short-term immunogenicity, but lack the ability to mount anadequate immune response in children under 2 years of age.Conjugated PS vaccines trigger a T-cell-dependent antigenresponse (T-helper cells promote B-cell activation) thatinduces long-term immunity. There are ve main carrier proteins used in vaccines today: tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197), N. meningitides outer membrane protein (OMP), and non-typeable H. influenza derived protein D (PD). Hib, meningococcal, and pneu-mococcal conjugate vaccines have shown good safety andimmunogenicity regardless of the carrier protein used,although data is conflicting as to which protein is most immunogenic and the implications of protein size are unclear. In the future, genetically detoxied vaccine production will likely become more widely used as the mechanism of action becomes better understood (Bae et al.,2009). In the conjugation process as shown in Figure 3, puried PS must rst be chemically modied to generate reactivegroups that can link to the protein, for example with either periodate or 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium (CDAP). Multiple factors, including low molecular weightimpurities in the protein and suboptimal PS to protein ratio,may result in inefcient conjugation with less than 20% ofthe activated PS becoming conjugated (Lee et al., 2009).Newer conjugation methods have recently been developed(addition of hydrozones to carboxyl groups or oximes toamino groups) that involve generating highly reactive groups on both the PS and carrier protein and have yields approaching 50% (Lees et al., 2006). Prevnar 13 1is a pneumococcal vaccine by Pzer, licensed in 2010, that contains cell membrane PS of 13 bacterialserotypes conjugated to diphtheria CRM197 carrier protein,a non-toxic variant of diphtheria toxin (Cooper et al., 2011).Each PS is manufactured independently with subsequentcombination during the formulation process, requiring almost a year from manufacture to release. The number of serotypes makes the analytical aspects and manufacturing ofthis vaccine particularly complex. Ancora is currently exploring a synthetic approach to carbohydrate production, which offers the advantages ofeasier purication (vs. natural carbohydrate antigens),improved manufacturing options, and the addition of ananchor for convenient conjugation to a carrier protein. An example was recently described for making a syntheticoligosaccharide for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) that was subsequently conjugated to CRM197 and showed promisingimmunogenicity in mice (Kabanova et al., 2010). DNA Vaccines DNA vaccines can lead to a strong and long-lasting immuneresponse through the inoculation of a plasmid containing agene for a particular protein antigen, which is subsequentlyexpressed by the cellular machinery of the person receivingthe vaccine. DNA vaccines offer the potential forimmunotherapy of diseases like tumors because they caninduce a cytotoxic T-effector lymphocyte response for antigen-specic apoptosis of infected cells (Polakova et al., 2009). Although only veterinary DNA vaccines have beenapproved to-date (e.g., equine vaccine for protection againstwest nile virus), there are numerous DNA vaccines invarious stages of development for targets such as HIV,cancer, and multiple sclerosis (Stuve et al., 2007). Production of DNA plasmids by bacterial fermentation at large scale is relatively straightforward. The main process challenge lies with developing effective and economical Figure 3. A typical process for production of a multivalent conjugate vaccine in which the polysaccharides are individually produced by fermentation, individuallyconjugated to a carrier protein, individually puried, and then combined into the nal formulation. [Color gure can be seen in the online version of this article, available at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com/bit] Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology1449 Biotechnology protocols, made difcult because the supercoiled plasmid DNA is quite similar in size andstructure to the contaminating RNA, genomic DNA, andopen circular plasmid DNA that are released upon cellularlysis along with the supercoiled DNA product. To satisfy regulatory guidelines for DNA vaccines, the plasmid DNA (pDNA) must be a highly puried,homogenous preparation of supercoiled circular covalently closed (ccc) plasmids. Purication to this level of quality is expensive and could account for a majority of totaloperational costs. Figure 4 depicts several of the most frequently used pDNA purication strategies, all of which start with centrifugationor, more commonly, ltration of the fermentation cell mass to reduce the overall volume (Freitas et al., 2009; Hoareet al., 2005; Lis Murphy et al., 2005; Stadleret al., 2004; Williams et al., 2009). If centrifugation is used, asolid-bowl centrifuge was found to be preferable to a disc-stack centrifuge, which has an additional high-stress stage ofnozzle discharge into the lower bowl (Kong et al., 2008). Theadditional degraded DNA resulting from nozzle discharge was not effectively removed during flocculation and led to increased fouling of the chromatographic columns. It wasalso found that a freeze/thaw step or a lengthy hold of freshcells in resuspension buffer following harvest resulted inhigher levels of contaminating DNA. The use of a geneticallyengineered E. coli with an endA deletion mutation may overcome some of this DNA degradation. This is followed by a heat-based, alkaline, or mechanical lysis of the bacterial cell walls to release the plasmids into solution (Cheetham et al., 1982). Heat lysis is a relativelysimple method that can make use of standard industrial heatexchangers, thereby reducing capital costs. It has thedisadvantage of requiring a signicant amount of costlylysozyme for many protocols, although a heat lysis methodwithout lysozyme has been reported that gives a comparableyield to an alkaline method (Wang et al., 2002). There are also reports of the use of autolytic E. coli strains that express lysozyme (endolysin) in the which isreleased to the periplasm upon induction (Carnes andWilliams, 2007). Precipitation is a method of solid-liquid separation that can deal with very large volumes. Fractional precipitationwith the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) isolates ccc pDNA from not only proteins, RNA, and endotoxin, but also host genomic DNA and relaxed and denatured forms of the plasmid (Lander et al.,2002). The ccc pDNA can then be selectively dissolved into acontrolled salt concentration as an initial recovery step.Using the minimum required salt concentration to dissolvethe pDNA allows any remaining impurities not removed bythe prior precipitations to be separated in an insoluble,lterable form. Since precipitation and dissolution are conventional unit operations, manufacturing scale-up is relatively straightforward. Figure 5 is a graph from Landeret al. (2002) that shows the standardized concentration (%w/v) of CTAB required for precipitation of various forms ofplasmid and genomic DNA. This graph illustrates that thereis a specic concentration of CTAB in which thecontaminating forms of plasmid DNA precipitate but thesupercoiled plasmid product remains soluble. Hydrated calcium silicate (gyrolite) selectively adsorbs DNA impurities, including genomic and open-circularDNA, leaving the ccc pDNA in solution (Winters et al.,2003). This selective adsorption step often follows precipi-tation methods as the gyrolite also adsorbs surfactants fromupstream processing steps, such as CTAB and Triton X-100,as well as endotoxin. Since gyrolite is far less expensive thanconventional wide-pore chromatographic resins, its use in plasmid purication is both scalable and economical. Figure 4.

However, VLPsare subunit vaccines that do not contain a genome and are incapable of a spreading infection. VLPs have a repetitive antigenic structure that is capable of efciently stimulatingboth cellular and humoral immune responses (Bolhassaniet al., 2011; Roy and Noad, 2008). Potentially, VLPs couldalso serve as excellent carrier molecules for the delivery ofepitopes in vaccines. Notable work in this area includeshepatitis B particles, HPV VLPs, and parvovirus epitopes from (Cook et al., 1999). Recombivax HB 1for prevention of hepatitis B infection was the rst recombinant protein vaccine for human use,licensed in the US in 1986 by Merck. Engerix-B byGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is a similar vaccine that waslicensed soon after. These were considered revolutionaryvaccines at the time, both because they were the rst to usevirus-like particles (VLPs) and because they were arguably the rst anti-cancer vaccines (hepatitis B infection increases the incidence of liver cancer). They replaced a previoushepatitis B vaccine that was produced by the labor-intensiveprocess of purifying antigen from the blood of infecteddonors. There was an intense urgency to develop these newrecombinant vaccines due to the advent of HIV infection inthe general population, which raised additional questionsabout the safety of blood-derived products. Both vaccines were made by inserting the gene for a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) into geneticallyengineered strains of S. cerevisiae . Figure 6 shows a process for producing HBsAg starting with fermentation ofrecombinant S. cerevisiae in a complex fermentation medium (Dekleva, 1999; Geels and Ye, 2010; Kee et al.,2008). The HBsAg protein is released into solution after celldisruption and detergent extraction, and is then puried bya series of physical and chemical methods, including fumedsilica adsorption, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and several ultraltration steps (not shown). The puried protein is treated in a potassium thiocynate solution withformaldehyde and then co-precipitated with potassiumaluminum sulfate (alum). Figure 5. Graph from Lander et al. (2002) displaying the solubility of supercoiled, open-circular, and multimeric forms of plasmid DNA and genomic DNA as a function ofCTAB concentration in claried lysate. The concentration of total DNA (plasmid forms plus genomic DNA) was measured by HPLC assay. Genomic DNA concentration was measured using qPCR percentage of supercoiled plasmid genomic DNA precipitate before supercoiled plasmid DNA. The error bars are based on duplicate measurements from qPCR and agarose gel assays. Figure 6. Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine manufacturing process that involves fermentation of genetically engineered strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing the genetic sequence encoding for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).Recombivax HB 1was the rst recombinant vaccine approved by the FDA in 1986. [Color gure can be seen in the online version of this article, available at http:// wileyonlinelibrary.com/bit] Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology 1451 Biotechnology and BioengineeringTwo VLP-based vaccines for HPV have since been FDA approved, Gardasil1(Merck) and Cervarix1(GSK), both for the prevention of HPV and cervical cancer. Numerousother particle vaccines are in various stages of clinical trials,including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)vaccines produced using BEVS with insect cells (Novavax,Gaithersburg, MD) and an influenza vaccine produced inplant cells (Medicago, Quebec City, Canada). Vaccines for melanoma, malaria, and hepatitis B and C vaccines that use chimeric hepatitis B core VLPs are also being explored(Kazaks et al., 2008; Plummer and Manchester, 2010). The Gardasil 1quadrivalent vaccine (HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) is produced by expressing the type-specicpapillomavirus major capsid protein, L1, in S. cerevisiae (Shi et al., 2007). Previous work has shown that recombi-nant HPV16 L1 pentamers assemble in vitro into capsid-like structures, and truncation of 10 N-terminal residues leads to a homogeneous preparation of 12-pentamer, icosahedralparticles (Chen et al., 2000). The fermentation process uses arecombinant yeast expression system with a galactose-inducible promoter (GAL1) expressing HPV capsid pro-teins, which permits high cell densities to be achieved beforethe L1 protein is expressed (premature expression of highlevels of foreign proteins may be detrimental to the host cells). Harvest is initiated when galactose reaches a designated level. The L1 protein makes up approximately15% of the total soluble protein. The main technicalchallenges occur downstream and include releasing theintracellular VLPs, typically by homogenization, andpreserving the intact VLP particles during cell lysis andpurication. A major VLP vaccine development challenge is that fermentation monitoring requires frequent removal of samples, followed by centrifugation, cell disruption, andchromatography to partially purify the VLPs. A miniatur-ized version of this was recently described, in which the keysteps of cell disruption and chromatography are run at verysmall scale (Wenger et al., 2007). The multi-step chroma-tography process was reduced 1,000-fold using microlitervolumes of resin in a pipette tip and automated on a liquid- handling robotic workstation. This high-throughput plat- form was found to be predictive of laboratory-scalepurication in terms of yield and purity, allowingoptimization of a fermentation process while reducingoverall time and materials. The purication of VLPs is similar to the purication of virus vaccine, with the advantage of less stringent biosafetyrequirements due to the VLP's inability to replicate and cause disease. Figure 7 shows the purication process for the Gardasil 1vaccine against HPV (Cook et al., 1999). The yeast cells are harvested from the fermenter and frozen. Afterthawing, benzonase is added to the cells to weaken the cellmembrane and the cell slurry is passed twice through ahomogenizer, which achieves a cellular disruption of greaterthan 95%. The mixture is incubated at 4 8C for 12-20 h to complete the lysis. The lysate is then claried by cross-flow mode and followed by twoCEX fractionation steps; the rst pass captures the VLPs and the second pass serves as a polishing step. Using this process,the puried VLPs are 98% homogeneous (purity) andoverall purication yield is 10% (Ding et al., 2010). Recently, a novel approach to create VLPs based on the VP1 structural protein from murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) in E. coli was described (Middleberg et al., 2011). Two insertion sites on the surface of MuPyV VP1 areexploited for the presentation of the M2e antigen frominfluenza and the J8 peptide from Group A Streptococcus(GAS). The most widely used yeast expression system is S. cerevisiae , but another yeast strain is becoming increasingly popular. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris , with its efcient and tightly regulated promoter from alcohol oxidase I gene (AOX1), utilizes economicalcarbon sources to reach the high cell densities needed forlarge-scale production of vaccines (Geels and Ye, 2010). Thishas been successfully applied to the manufacture of lowcost Hepatitis B vaccine by various Indian manufacturers.The recombinant proteins are often secreted into the media, which facilitates downstream purication and analysis. Proteins expressed in P. pastoris have high levels of Figure 7. Initial purication process for the Gardasil1(Merck) virus-like parti- cle vaccine, which is produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and requires cell disruption to release the virus-like particles.

One team developed a large-scale chro-matographic purication protocol for production ofHBsAg from P. pastoris (Hardy et al., 2000), although chromatography-based purication can become prohibi- tively expensive at large scale (Curling and Gottschalk,2007). Another team increased production threefold of arecombinant disulde-rich malaria protein in P. pastoris by genetically engineering the strain to overproduce the protein disulde isomerase (Tsai et al., 2006). Cancer Vaccines It was recently estimated that the total of infection-attributable cancer in the year 2002 was 1.9 million cases, or 17.8% of the global cancer burden (Parkin, 2006). The principal agents were the bacterium Helicobacter pylori , hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, herpesvirus, and HPV. Preventing cancer by protecting the hostagainst infectious pathogens shows a paradigm shift inprophylactic vaccines. A new report predicts that the cancervaccine market will swell to a $7 billion industry by 2015,which is contingent on success in clinical trials and in the ability to scale-up the technology (Martino, 2011). There are six types of vaccines in development: antigen/adjuvantvaccines, DNA vaccines, vector-based vaccines, tumor cellvaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, and anti-idiotype vaccines(Bolhassani et al., 2011; Schuster et al., 2009). The goal of therapeutic cancer vaccines is to induce immunity against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Animportant advance is the development of techniques to identify antigens that are recognized by tumor-specic T lymphocytes (Bolhassani et al., 2011). These tumor antigensfall into two broad categories: (1) tumor-specic sharedantigens or TAAs, and (2) tumor-specic unique antigens.TAAs are expressed by more than one type of tumor cells,such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but can also beexpressed on normal tissues in differing amounts. Unique tumor antigens result through mutations induced through physical or chemical carcinogens. Both shared and uniquetumor antigens can be used in developing cancer vaccines,although an effective vaccine should provide long-termmemory to prevent tumor recurrence. Some scientistsbelieve that for total tumor elimination, both the innate and adaptive immune systems should be activated (Pejawar- Gaddy and Finn, 2008). T-cell-based immunotherapy has demonstrated the proof-of-principle that immune control of cancer is possible even with metastatic disease. Thechallenges, however, are formidable and will likely need toinclude strategies not only to stimulate tumor-specicimmunity but also ways to overcome the immunesuppression associated with malignancy (Douek andNabel, 2011). Dendreon's patient-specic prostate cancer vaccine Provenge (Sipuleucel-T) was the rst therapeutic cancervaccine to be approved by the FDA. It was approved in April 2010 for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer andis considered a breakthrough in cancer treatment. The activecomponent is antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that presentprostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) to T-cells. Figure 8 process where the APCs are patient leukocytes obtainedvia apheresis and combined with PA2024, which is PAPlinked to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a protein that induces a powerful immune response (Division of Cell and Gene Therapies, 2010). ThePA2024 activates the leukocytes, which are infused backinto the patient where they present PAP to T-cells, which inturn target and kill cancer cells. In vitro generation of dendritic cells (DC) loaded with TAAs has also been investigated against human glioblastomamultiforme, an aggressive primary brain tumor (Bolhassani et al., 2011). It has been reported that the injection of exosomes derived from DCs loaded with tumor peptides Figure 8. Patient-specic process for production of Dendreon's prostate can- cer vaccine Provenge1(Sipuleucel-T) which involves obtaining a patient's leukocytes through apheresis, activating the leukocytes with PA2024, and returning them to thepatient. [Color gure can be seen in the online version of this article, available at http:// wileyonlinelibrary.com/bit] Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology1453 Biotechnology a potent anti-tumor immune response. Peptide vaccine efcacy is determined by how the peptides arerecognized and processed by the immune system.Specically, peptide concentration, multi-valency, second-ary structure, length, and the presence of helper T-cellepitopes can signicantly affect the immune response. Geron's autologous cancer vaccine candidate, GRNVAC1, is also a dendritic cell product (Dimond, 2010). It has been studied in PhI trials and currently is in a PhII study of acute myelogenous leukemia patients inremission. It is distinct from Provenge as transfectsimmature dendritic cells through telomerasecatalytic linked to a lysosomal targetingsequence (LAMP). The transfected cells express hTERT-LAMP as protein, which can be presented in the context of each patient's specic human leukocyte antigen. The transfected cells are then matured in medium containinga cytokine mix. Cryopreserved aliquots of the nal matureDC preparations are ultimately supplied to the clinic forintradermal injections. In January 2011, Amgen bought Biovex and acquired their lead product candidate OncoVEXGM-CSF, a thera-peutic oncolytic vaccine for melanoma and head and neck cancer that is in PhIII clinical trials. OncoVEX GM-CSF is a version of herpes simplex virus which has been engineered to replicate selectively in tumors, leaving surrounding healthy tissues unharmed, and also engineered to express GM-CSF.This enhances the anti-tumor immune response to tumorantigens released following lytic virus replication. Analytical Process development for a vaccine occurs in parallel to thedevelopment of analytical methods. Techniques need to bedeveloped for measuring the product and any impurities, in addition to assessing the potency of the nal product. This topic is beyond the scope of this review but a few key pointsare included here. Stringent regulatory requirements are often the basis for establishing a purication paradigm and accurate analyticaltechniques are essential for validating each step. Except forvaccines prepared in diploid human cells, residual host-cell DNA concentrations must be <10 ng per human dose and the size of residual DNA should be no more than the size of agene (Board on Life Sciences, 2011). Host-cell proteinconcentrations also need to be controlled and new vaccines generally contain <1mg per dose. There exist numerous assays that can protein cannot effectively determine the range of heterogeneity in key surface properties such as size, charge, and aggregation (Rathore et al., 2008, 2010). Changesin fermentation conditions during process development can impact intracellular aggregation, proteolysis, post-translational modications, and differences in relative impurity levels, all of which can have a signicant impacton downstream processing and the quality of the nalproduct (Metz et al., 2009). Tests for adventitious agents have gradually become more extensive and complex. Where possible, viral clearanceltration is included as a process step and part of riskmitigation for removal of adventitious agents. New approaches based on massively parallel sequencing of the transcriptome have been described as a technique for use inan integrated testing program for release of a cell line thatutilizes both specic and broad-based detection methods(Onions et al., 2011). A key vaccine release assay is the potency assay, which is, ideally, a predictor of clinical performance. Development ofa potency assay needs to start as soon as representative vaccine material is available. Historically, many potency assays were developed using animals, but new vaccinestypically rely on in vitro testing methods. There are essentially four different approaches to developing a potencyassay: (1) immunization-challenge test, (2) serologicalanalyses, (3) immunization-challenge test requires labor-intensiveand intrinsically variable animal models that are seldom used for newer vaccines. Serological analyses typically involve measuring antibody concentration, antibody avidity(surrogate marker for memory), or cellular immune responses (T-cell proliferation and cytokine quantication),but can also involve functional antibody assays (e.g.,pathogen or toxin neutralizing). Antibody responses canbe measured with ELISA or in multiplex assays that analyzefor several antigens simultaneously in very small volumes (Metz et al., 2009). Cell-based assays detect cellular immune on flow cytometry, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of intracellularcytokines and effector molecules. recent advance thedevelopment of microsphere-based multiplex assays thatquantify multiple small volumes. Titration assays measure potency indirectly, for example, by measuring number of viable particles, determined by colonycounting or by virus titration, in the case of live-attenuatedvirus vaccines. In some cases, it may be feasible to usequantitative PCR, which is faster, less labor-intensive, andlikely more accurate. The development of appropriate potency assays is difcult because the exact epitopes that determine product quality are often not dened. In addition, adjuvants with only partially understood mechanisms of action have to be addedto achieve the desired immune response. It is often best todevelop ''marker'' assays for product quality that can belinked to animal responses, and after clinical trials, humanresponses. This information can be used to develop a betterscientic understanding of the production process and itsimpact on product quality, as promoted by the FDA Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative, which is discussed 1454 Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 109, No. 6, June, 2012in the Globalization and Regulatory Influences section of this article. Formulation and Delivery Two of the main goals of formulation development are: (1)to improve the immunogenicity of a vaccine and (2) to improve the stability of the vaccine components. These goals are typically accomplished by implementing one or more ofthe following: adjuvant vehicles, excipients, binders, pre-servatives, carrier emulsifyingagents, wetting agents, non-viral vectors, and transfectionfacilitating compounds (Jones, 2008). One of the main challenges for recombinant protein- based vaccines is that the protein itself may be poorly immunogenic and many require the addition of an adjuvant to boost immune responses. Tested adjuvants includesynthetic emulsions (oil-in-water), alum cytokine-based adjuvants like type-one interferon, withalum being the most widely used (Li et al., 2007). Adjuvants typically increase inflammation and activate the complimentcascade, possibly creating particulate multivalency, as well as allowing increased exposure of the antigen by lengthening its release into the injection site. In practice, the regulatoryapproach to novel adjuvants is conservative with apreference for those with a history of safe use (e.g.,alum). Exceptions include MF59 (squalene emulsion),which has been used in more than 20 countries withinthe last decade as an adjuvant for influenza antigens HA andNA to enhance uptake by APCs, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), which is a bacterial component lipopolysaccharide that acts on the highly expressed TLR-4 on APCs inducingcell-mediated immunity (Tritto et GSK's HPV vaccine Cervarix 1as a component of their proprietary Adjuvant System 04 (AS04). A major formulation challenge for Gardasil1(Merck) was the preparation of an aqueous solution that was stableunder a variety of purication, processing, and storage conditions (Shank-Retzlaff et al., 2006). To achieve this, non-ionic surfactants were introduced and the salt concentration was adjusted, which stabilized the VLPsagainst surface adsorption, conformational change, induc-ible for Gardasil Aluminum Adjuvant N NaCl, 0.01% polysor-bate 80, 10 mM pH 6.2, with disassembled and reassembled HPV VLPs (Shi et al., 2007). The MAA signicantly enhanced accelerated stability of the vaccine against heat stress-induced degradation, believed to be dueto the physical properties of the adjuvant, which serves as a physical barrier, preventing intermolecular collisions andthus minimizing aggregation of HPV VLPs. improving both thestability (3mo \u00feat 37 8C) and the in vitro potency of the vaccine. In addition, the in vivo immunogenicity of thevaccine was improved by 10-fold as shown by mouse potency studies. The limitations of live viruses or bacteria as vectors include their limited DNA carrying capacity, toxicity,immunogenicity, the possibility of random integration ofthe vector DNA into the host genome, and their high cost(Khatri et al., 2008; Mills, 2009). Due to this, non-viralvectors have been further focused as an alternative in delivery systems and include cationic polymers (Martin and goal is to optimize the transfection efciency of theabove options. The routes of administration and formula-tion of DNA vaccines affect the therapeutic response byaltering the immune pathway; the highest efcacy wasachieved after in vivo electroporation and gene gun delivery. One team applied electroporation to delivery of a DNA- based HIV vaccine and encouraging mice data are presented(Yan et al., 2011). Another main goal of formulation and delivery design for vaccines intended for both the developed and the developingworld is to improve convenience and patient accessibilitythrough unrefrigerated transportation and storage, needle-free administration, and dose minimization (Aunins et al., 2011). Due to the concern over the health effects, many vaccine manufacturers have moved away from the use of thimerosalas a preservative and, in general, no preservative is used forsingle dose vials or syringes. Some manufacturers are using2-phenoxyethanol to prevent the growth of gram-negativebacteria in single-dose vaccines such as DTaP, Hepatitis A,and inactivated polio vaccine (Bae et al., 2009). The development of a multi-dose formulation for Prevnar 13 TM using 2-Phenoxyethanol (2-PE) at a concentration of 5 mg per dose was stable and met recommended criteria forantimicrobial effectiveness over a 30-month period(Khandke et al., 2011). Despite signicant efforts during development to opti- mize excipients for product stabilization, many vaccines donot exhibit long-term stability in aqueous solutions, especially if they cannot be stored uninterrupted in cold temperatures (difcult in developing countries). For thisreason, many vaccines are lyophilized to a powderformulation. Lyophilization, however, can alter a varietyof product characteristics, including pH and soluteconcentration, which may adversely affect the vaccineantigens (Chen et al., 2010; Jennings, 2002). In addition,development time to establish the optimal lyophilization cycle can be lengthy and costly. The traditional additives (lyoprotectants) for lyophiliza- tion of biological agents include sugars and sugar alcohols,which encase the proteins in glassy state structures providinga more rigid, thermodynamically stable state (Amorij et al.,2007; Mouradian et al., 1984). In some cases, polymers oramino acids have been combined with the carbohydrateformulations for improved stability in a continuous crystalline network, although this reportedly led to loss of Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology 1455 Biotechnology and Bioengineeringproduct in some situations (Zeng et al., 2009). Aridis pharmaceuticals has improved on this by developing astabilization technology that uses small molecular weightplasticizers in combination with traditional sugar stabilizersto ll in any remaining molecular gaps, further reducingmolecular vibrations that lead to degradation. They reportthat this technology increased the temperature required forstorage and distribution from below freezing to 25 8C with a shelf life of several years (Cicerone et al., 2003; Cicerone and Soles, 2004). Stabilitech has developed another stabilizationtechnology involving the use of chemical excipients thatmimic proteins found in various types of seeds during thedesiccation stage (e.g., passion flower, chrysanthemum).From a panel of proprietary excipients, Stabilitech performsmultivariate analyses to determine the optimal combinationto provide the best stabilization. The use of these novel excipients during lyophilization resulted in minimal product loss for an adenovirus vaccine stored at 37 8C for 3 months (Drew, 2011a,b). Vaccine delivery by needle and syringe has several disadvantages to lower densityof APCs relative to skin. There are several alternatives to intramuscular injection currently being explored. One is the Nanopatch TM, a dry-coated microprojection array skin patch that delivers vaccines intracutaneously in approxi-mately 5 min (Corbett et al., 2010). The needle density wasoptimized to target immune cells in the epidermis anddermis. Both Fluvax 2008 1(unadjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine) and Gardasil1(HPV vaccine with alum adjuvant) have been administered in mice using this technology, resulting in higher neutralizing antibody titers than intramuscular injection. Another team has madeimportant incremental steps in the evolution of microneedletechnology (Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008). Their rstapproach was based on stainless steel microneedles dippedinto the vaccine, which has since evolved into a design thatencapsulates molecules within microneedles. The micro-needles subsequently dissolve within the skin for bolus or sustained delivery and do not leave behind biohazardous or sharp medical waste. Challenges include device manufactur-ing and designing a package that is compact yet robustenough for shipment. The mucosal immune system is an attractive target site for vaccines since many pathogens infect the host at M-cells inthe mucosal surface. Mucosal delivery, which does notrequire a needle, is already being used for several vaccines (Chadwick et al., 2009; Dennehy, 2007). For example, the live attenuated influenza vaccine FluMist 1(MedImmune) is given as a nasal spray (Belshe et al., 1998). The mucosalroute of delivery may contribute to the heterovariant cross-protection seen with both of these vaccines by inducingbroader immunity, including mucosal immunoglobulin A.Mucosal delivery is also being studied for several otherpotential vaccines directed against diseases such as HIV infection and tuberculosis. Vaccination at mucosal surfacescan induce local protection at the infection sites, as well as inducing systemic immunity; however, direct antigendelivery through an oral or nasal route generally leads toweak induction of immunity. Efcacy can be improved byco-administering or fusing the antigen with a strongmucosal adjuvant, such as cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholera or heat labile toxin B of E. coli . One team recombinantly produced LTB in soybean plants that stimulated the antibody response against a co-administered antigen by 500-fold (Moravec et al., 2007). This technologycould serve as a cost-effective efcient platform forgenerating oral vaccines in the future. Particle-mediated delivery systems can enhance mucosal vaccination by protecting immunogenic material during delivery, providing targeted delivery systems, and allowing incorporation of adjuvant material (Chadwick et al., 2009). Encapsulation into microspheres or a multi-phase systems such as water-oil-water multiple emulsions, or biologically-active polymers can shield the antigens from the gastroin-testinal tract. The intestinal residence time can be extendedusing specic muco- or bio-adhesins that bind to the intestinal mucus or to the epithelial cells in the intestine. The FluGEM TMvaccine from Mucosis (Groningen, The Netherlands) is an intranasal influenza vaccine, based on their MimopathTMtechnology, which recently entered PhI trials. This technology improves vaccine potency via theformulation of Lactococcus lactis bacteria into non-living bacterial-like particles that can showcase pathogen or tumorantigens on their surface. Mucosis is also developing twoadditional vaccine products: PneuGEM TM, a pneumococcal vaccine, and SynGEMTM, a vaccine to prevent RSV viral infection. Globalization and Regulatory Influences An estimated 2.5 million people die globally each year fromvaccine-preventable diseases, many of these attributable toavailable vaccines not being fully utilized. This underusemainly occurs in developing countries due to low income, lack of medical infrastructure, and lack of cold chain facilities. Innovations that could improve this situation include: high-yield production technologies to reduce vaccine costs, improved adjuvants and combinationvaccines that reduce the number of shots required,packaging that reduces the required space for a vaccine inthe cold chain, and heat-stable formulations that allow forexcursions from cold chain systems. These innovations would also benet developed nations by reducing the healthcare cost burden and improving patient compliance. The 2010 National Vaccine Plan (NVP) stresses the need for rapid, flexible, and cost-effective manufacturing meth-ods (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2010).Since the last NVP was issued in 1994, new vaccine supplyconcerns have arisen, including pandemic influenza andbioterrorism threats, which require surge capacity. Creating regional capacity will allow for fast and relatively 1456 Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 109, No. 6, June, 2012inexpensive vaccine production in times of need and eliminates many supply-chain issues. New approaches tovaccine manufacturing are needed, along with improveddelivery methods, stability proles, and quality testingprocedures. That same year, Health and Human Servicesalso allocated $2 billion to overhaul the pandemic responseprocess. This overhaul will involve investment in regulatoryscience and review, a reassessment of policy, and a more effective use of public-private partnerships. The need for a regulatory overhaul is not only recognized bythe United States, there is a critical worldwide need forimproved access to vaccines (Milstien et al., 2006). Thisglobalization of vaccines will also involve the slow andarduous processes of regulatory harmonization, widespreadagreement on intellectual property rights, and the involve-ment of developing-country manufacturers in vaccine supply. Many regulations are more stringent for vaccines than biotech products, largely because vaccine processes areperceived as not well characterized. This is due in part to thefact that vaccines involve many technology platforms,making it difcult to standardize production processes. Thismay lead to a unique facility for each vaccine family,resulting in a long lead-time for construction of a commercial-scale facility. Phase III clinical trials require doses made in large-scale manufacturing facilities to be representative of the nal process. If process changes are made, clinical bridging studies are required to demonstrateequivalence. The impact of this is that sound processdecisions must be made early in development. This leads to ahigher level of risk, since an early large capital investment infacilities is required. This risk can be mitigated by the use of disposable or single-use technology. The benets of disposable or single-use bioreactors (SUBs) include lower facility capital and operation costs,shorter changeover times, increased productivity, lower riskof bacterial or mold contamination, and less scrap. Theyincrease flexibility in the manufacturing suite, enablingmultiple processes using the same equipment without cross-contamination risks or scale issues. GE manufactures Wave Bioreactors TM, available in working volumes up to 500 L, which are typically used in process development and in seedtrain expansion during manufacturing. Several companieshave developed stirred-tank SUBs in volumes up overcome the mass transfer limitations ofwave-style disposable bioreactors and offer improved agitation, sparging, and feeding options that rival stainless steel bioreactors. This has enabled their use for growth ofanimal cells where mixing demands for oxygen transfer aremodest, making them suitable for many vaccine applica-tions. The stirred-tank SUBs can also be used for bacterialfermentation in some cases, although the higher energyinput required for bacterial fermentation often necessitatescooling, making scale-up less straightforward than for animal cells. Despite their suitability for animal cellprocesses, the current volume limitations may hinder the wide-spread acceptance of SUBs in cases where largevolumes are required, limiting their use to seed trainexpansion (Nienow, 2006). Many companies are incorpo-rating single-use technologies into their production pro-cesses. For example, Bavarian Nordic (Kvistgaard,Denmark) manufactures a new investigational modiedvaccinia Ankara smallpox vaccine in GE Wave bioreactor bags (Board on Life Sciences, 2011). Several companies offer single-use mixers and down- stream purication systems as well. Sartorius andNatrix both sell single-use, disposableanion-exchange membrane adsorption cartridges, whichcan be used for DNA and host cell protein removal or viralclearance. Likewise, Pall Corporation (Port Washington,NY) offers a similar disposable membrane product specically designed for DNA removal. Other companies including GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK), Millipore(Billerica, MA), BioFlash Partners (Worcester, pre-sanitized disposable-format chroma- tography columns. Most of these columns were designed for polishing applications. The last decade has seen a regulatory push towards enhanced process understanding and process control. New regulatory initiatives such as Process Analytical Technology(PAT), Quality by Design (QbD), and Real-time Release(RTR) will impact the future of vaccine process develop-ment, trending towards platform technologies. PAT is aregulatory framework of guidelines that encourages inno-vation, as it will be necessary to respond to the challenges ofnew technologies and ways of doing business (e.g., personalized medicine and pandemic response). Gains in quality, safety, and efciency are expected to include: cycletime reduction with the use of on-, in-, or at-linemeasurements and controls, prevention of rejects, imple-mentation of RTR, improved safety with increased use ofautomation, improved efciency from continuous proces-sing. These gains are expected to be realized by regulatoryinspectors, manufacturers, and patients. QbD involves creation of a design space that is a multidimensional combination of material attributes andprocess parameters that have been demonstrated to provideassurance of quality. Process changes within an approveddesign space do not require additional regulatory submis-sions and approval, allowing flexible processes. Creating adesign space involves identifying process parameters, whichcan influence product quality and then performing a multivariate analysis to locate the ranges in which process parameters can be varied without affecting the productquality. RTR involves basing the release of a product on process understanding rather than end-product testing or batchanalysis. This requires identifying the critical processparameters (CPPs) and understanding their influence on the critical quality attributes (CQAs). During processing, a risk-based control strategy must be in place to ensure that Josefsberg and Buckland: Vaccine Process Technology 1457 Biotechnology and Bioengineeringthe process is maintained within the boundaries of the design space. Streefland et al. have published several papers on applying the concepts of PAT and QbD to the Bordetella pertussis vaccine for whooping cough (Streefland et al., 2007, 2009; van de Waterbeemd et al., 2009). This bacterial whole-cellvaccine relies on conventional vaccine technology that issubject to inherent variability, yet the critical process parameters were still easily dened within a design space once the CQAs were understood. In this example, the mainCQA was the outer-membrane protein composition and theCPPs were the dissolved oxygen level and the concentrationof key nutrients lactate and glutamate. Near Infraredspectroscopy (NIR) was simultaneously used to monitorother process parameters, such as optical density andparticle size, as a PAT application to allow RTR. Integrating and recording this data will build a more accurate design space over time. Conclusion The evolution of vaccines (e.g., live attenuated, recombi-nant) and vaccine production methods (e.g., in ovo, cellculture) are intimately tied to each other. As vaccinetechnology has advanced, the methods to produce andanalyze vaccines have advanced in parallel. Drivers fortechnology innovation include the goal of making vaccinessafer and more immunogenic in a cost effective way that allows for worldwide distribution. Advances in biology also result in the identication of new targets for vaccine researchand these opportunities are often developed given theuniversal need and desire to improve human health and togain protection from avoidable disease. These advances,along with improvements in disposable equipment design,are paving the way towards vaccines that are more accessibleto developing countries and in pandemic outbreaks, as well as being more convenient and safe to use. As initiatives such as PAT and QbD gain widespread acceptance for highlypuried vaccines, we can anticipate more streamlinedregulatory approvals ultimately improving the global diseaseburden.
