Many people find that talking with a chaplain can help during this period. Chaplains with Spiritual Care Services provide support to patients, families, friends and staff members at UCSF Health's Parnassus Heights, Mount Zion and Mission Bay campuses. Spiritual Care at UCSF Parnassus and Mount Zion: (415) 353-1941 Mission Bay: (415) 514-4200 Chaplains representing many faiths are available around the clock to be a caring presence, offer spiritual and emotional support, and listen with openness and understanding. Patients, families and staff are encouraged to call a chaplain when experiencing fear, anger, loneliness, helplessness, anxiety, grief or loss or when they just need someone to talk to. Chaplains also are available for times of celebration, prayer and rituals. We are available to support all our patients, whatever their spiritual path may be. Patients do not need to be affiliated with a congregation or faith community to call a chaplain. However, if you do belong to a community, we can notify a faith community of your choice to arrange for a visit. Your minister, rabbi, imam, priest or other spiritual adviser may visit you or your family member at any time.
