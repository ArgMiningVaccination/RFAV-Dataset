You can leave comments there or here. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\" These are not inconsiderable powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. Charles, Prince of Wales, has been unusually public in expressing his views. [He told a conference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7147870/Prince-of-Wales-I-was-accused-of-being-enemy-of-the-Enlightenment.html) at St James's Palace \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment\" \"I felt proud of that.\" That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society. I have no doubt that Prince Charles means well. He can't be blamed for his lack of education. But his views on medicine date from a few centuries ago, and he has lost no opportunity to exploit his privileged position to proclaim them. Euphemisms for quackery He set up the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (PFIH) to promote his views. ( \"Integrated\", in this context, is, of course, just the latest euphemism for \"alternative\" or \"quack\".) When the Foundation collapsed because of a financial scandal in 2010, it was replaced by the \"College of Medicine\". The name changed, but [not the people](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) behind it. Initially this phoenix was to be named the \" [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263)\", but by this time the prince's views on medicine had become sufficiently discredited that the word \"integrated\" was quickly dropped. This might be thought less than frank, but it is just employment of the classic [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) technique, beloved by used car salesmen. His views were well publicised in a PFIH publication, \"Complementary Healthcare: a Guide for Patients\". That volume either omitted or misrepresented the evidence about the one question that matters most to patients - does the treatment work or not? It caused me to write a much shorter, but more accurate, version, the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). The PFIH guide was arguably a danger to public health. When, very properly, it was criticised by Edzard Ernst, [a letter was sent](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/11/health.monarchy) from from the prince's private secretary to Ernst's vice-chancellor, Steve Smith. Instead of defending Ernst's public spirited action, Smith [instituted disciplinary proceedings](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89) against Ernst that lasted for a year. The prince had intervened directly in the affairs of the university. Steve Smith was rewarded with a knighthood in 2011. None of this criticism has dimmed the prince's enthusiasm for barmy medical ideas. He is well known to write many letters to government ministers to try to persuade them to adopt his ideas in a whole range of areas. In July 2013, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, visited the prince at Clarence House. The visit was reported to be to persuade the minister to defend homeopathy, though it was more likely to have been to press the case to confer a government stamp of [approval on herbalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners by giving them statutory regulation. This is a matter that was recently raised again [in parliament](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0) by Charles' greatest ally, [David Tredinnick MP](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6007) (Con, Bosworth) who got into trouble for charging astrology software to expenses. We shall never know what pressure was applied. A ruling of the Information Commissioner judged, reasonably enough, that there was public interest in knowing what influences were being brought to bear on public policy. But the Attorney General [overruled the judgement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters) on the grounds that \"Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is exactly what we are worried about. Influence on politics The prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his guide, and an astonishing \u00a3900,000 to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). When NHS Choices (itself set up by DH to assess evidence) tried to rewrite its web page about that most discredited of all forms of quackery, homeopathy, officials in DH [referred the new advice to Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), the medical director of the Prince's Foundation and, were it not for the Freedom of Information act, the DH would have caused inaccurate information to be provided. The DH has a chief medical officer and two scientific advisors, but prefers to take the advice of the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods. And when his business branched into selling quack \"detox\" and herbal nonsense he found himself censured by both [the MHRA](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/duchy-originals-pork-pies.html) and the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/5/Duchy-Originals-Ltd/TF_ADJ_46199.aspx) (ASA) for making unjustifiable medical claims for these products. Ainsworth's homeopathic pharmacy is endorsed by both Prince Charles and the Queen: it has two Royal Warrants. They sell \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, measles, rubella and whooping cough. These \"vaccines\" contain nothing whatsoever so they are obviously a real danger to public health. Despite the fact that Ainsworth's had already been [censured by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/7/Ainsworths-(London)-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_148070.aspx) in 2011 for selling similar products, Ainsworth's continued to recommend them with a \" [casual disregard for the law](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/ainsworths-pharmacy.html)\". The regulator (the MHRA) failed to step in to stop them until it was eventually stirred into action by a young BBC reporter, Sam Smith, made a [programme for BBC South West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI&feature=c4-overview&list=UUei35H3nu7bduw-6DBJFGrQ). Then, at last, the somnolent regulator was stirred into action. The MHRA \"told Ainsworths to stop advertising a number of products\" (but apparently not to stop making them or selling them). They still sell Polonium metal 30C and Swine Meningitis 36C, and a booklet that recommends homeopathic \"vaccination\". Ainsworth's sales are no doubt helped by the Royal Warrants. The consequence is that people may die of meningitis. In 2011, the MHRA Chief Executive Professor Kent Woods, was knighted. It runs in the family The Prince of Wales is not the only member of the royal family to be obsessed with bizarre forms of medicine. The first homeopath to the British royal family, Frederick Quin, was a son of the Duchess of Devonshire (1765-1824). Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. | | The RLHIM is a The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. | | The Queen and Peter Fisher Observer 8 April 2007 The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value tradition and how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any question concerning science or medicine I'd ask someone with more education.
