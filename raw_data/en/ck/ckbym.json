This practice is based on Chinese medical theory which has been employed for thousands of years. There are specific energetic associations of botanicals and their ability to stimulate, direct, and activate Qi. Chinese materia medica's classify herbs and their influence on specific areas of the body. Our Aroma Acu-Sticks are all-natural solid roll-ups containing essential oils that are applied to corresponding acu-points to activate their healing potential. Essential oils are classified in the same way and are applied to corresponding [aroma acu-points](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-point-profiles/) where they are absorbed by the skin into the bloodstream, acupuncture points, and acupuncture channels. Diluted pure essential oils can be applied to acu-points prior to acupuncture needle insertion or acupressure application by licensed acupuncturists for a synergistic treatment affect, or can be applied to acu-points as a stand-alone self-care treatment by patients. Dr. Browne realized that applying essential oils to acupressure points was messy and time-consuming for both practitioner and patient self-care application. Therefore, she developed solid [Aroma Acu-sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-with-essential-oils/) decades ago that are not only convenient, but incredibly affordable when compared to purchasing individual pure essential oils to activate acupuncture points. In clinic she was able to instruct patients on how to apply the [Aroma Acu-sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-with-essential-oils/) to acu-points between treatments leading to fewer required acupuncture sessions for patients. This transformed an unsustainable modality for a busy acupuncture practice into a viable healing method. Additionally, this practice involves patients in their own recovery which in itself has been shown to result in better therapeutic outcomes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964421/). Because Aroma Acu-Therapy easily lends itself to patient self-care, Dr. Browne put together [ailments protocols for hundreds of conditions linked here](https://agelessherbs.com/sitemap.php). She also wrote [individual pages for acupuncture point uses](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-point-profiles/) where one can find her videos showing the location of each point. These efforts have taken years, but allow lay-people to effectively apply essential oils to acupuncture points. [Essential oils](https://agelessherbs.com/essential-oils-for-acupressure/) work on the same energetic plane as acupuncture-acupressure stimulation and carry a resonation of healing intent in the same way as a needle or pressure would. The essential oils activate the potential of the development or amalgamation of peptides much as a needle insertion would to communicate healing potential of the intended acu-point in the physical body or mind. This stimulates the central nervous system releasing harmonizing neurological and/or endocrine chemicals into the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These biochemical changes stimulate the body's natural healing abilities and promote physical and emotional well-being. The healing potential is magnified by the combination of the refined influence of the essential oils and the acu-points affect. By pairing the correct aroma blend with the correlating acupoint one will initiate energetic, emotional, and physiological shifts in the body that are gentle, yet profound. This therapy targets the \"root\" causes of ailments often based on organ-level imbalances. [Aroma Acu-Therapy](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-therapy/) is intended to be implemented as part of a larger wellness plan and healthy lifestyle habits to address chronic conditions. One can expect gentle shifts with a gradual lessening of intensity and frequency of ailment symptoms over time with regular use similar to what one would experience by receiving regular acupuncture treatments. Our [ Aroma Acu-sticks\u00ae activate acupuncture points on the related channels](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-with-essential-oils/) and also work to clear blockages of the corresponding channels, or meridians, that cause pain and immobility. [Applying essential oils to acupuncture points](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acupressure-directions/) is not a novel therapy; Dr. Browne started making her Five Element Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae back in 1998. However, multiple studies have been published on the National Institute of Health (NIH) website and books have become available on the subject recently boosting the popularity of Aroma Acu-Therapy . Some have asked what the difference is between Aroma Acu-Therapy and simple aromatherapy. In other words, why wouldn't you just take a bath with lavender essential oils and let it activate all of the points rather than applying it to specific acupuncture point? For one who has no understanding of traditional Chinese medicine this is a reasonable question; however, any doctor of acupuncture knows that the most skilled master acupuncturist will use the fewest possible acu-points creating a focused treatment protocol leading to the most profound healing outcomes. Utilizing too many acupuncture points scatters the Qi and does not send clear communication to the body as to the intent of the treatment when activating individual acupuncture points. Each specific acu-point serves different needs and addresses different symptoms and indications. That's not to say that a lavender bath is not useful, it's just not tapping in to the powerful healing potential of the acupuncture points, channels, and connected energetic organ systems. Q & A Question: Is Aroma Acu-Therapy a stand-alone treatment modality? Answer: Like [Aroma can be used as a stand-alone treatment modality. Unlike acupuncture, the Aroma Acu-sticks\u00ae would be applied daily rather than attending acupuncture once per week. Question: Can I combine Aroma Acu-Therapy with other topical and/or internal botanical remedies? Answer: Like acupuncture, your outcomes would be much improved and speedier when utilizing the Aroma Acu-sticks\u00ae along with herbal therapies and positive lifestyle habits. For chronic, or long-standing conditions, [Aroma Acu-Therapy ](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-therapy/) is intended to be implemented as part of a larger wellness plan. Question: What is the shelf-life for the [Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-sticks/)? Answer: They are made with all-natural ingredients so they will not stay fresh forever. If they are stored in a cool place they should stay potent and stable for about a year. Question: I have multiple health conditions; should I purchase multiple kits for each condition? Answer: No, you can use the same sticks on different points for different conditions and do not need to purchase multiple kits. We offer protocols using [Aroma Acu-Therapy ](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-therapy/) for over 100 ailments on AgelessHerbs.com which you can source through the \"sitemap\" linked at the bottom of every page of the website. Question: Can I use these [Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-sticks-1/) on acu-points other than the ones specified in the brochure? Answer: Yes, they can be used on any points on the related acupuncture channel. Question: How long will each stick last? Answer: That depends on how often you use the sticks and how many points that you are applying the stick to. If you use the sticks only on the 5 points listed on the ailments pages a couple of times a day they should last close to a month. Question: How long before the [Aroma-Acu-Sticks\u00ae ](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-sticks-1/)start to work? How long before I notice improvements. Answer: In our description, we try to be crystal clear that this type of natural therapy is not a \"quick fix\". Rather, it is a therapy, and one would not expect something like physical therapy to correct health issues with one session. One can expect gentle shifts with a gradual lessening of intensity and frequency of ailment symptoms over time with daily use similar to weekly acupuncture treatments. This is a gentle, but profound, self-care healing modality. Question: Can I apply these [Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-sticks-1/) to my pets? Answer: No, the Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae are not intended for use on animals. Question: How do the [Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae ](https://agelessherbs.com/aroma-acu-sticks-1/)work? Answer: Concentrated botanical extracts are absorbed through the skin activating acupuncture points and channels that connect directly to organ systems according to [Chinese medical theory.](https://agelessherbs.com/traditional-chinese-medical-theory/) Aroma Acu Point Therapy is not a novel therapy; Dr. Browne started making her Five Element Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae back in 1998, recent studies have been published on the peer-reviewed National Institute of Health (NIH) website, and multiple books have been published on the subject. Question: Do the Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae smell good? Answer: Many people do love their scent, but this is very subjective as each individuals' brain interprets smell differently. The [Fire Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/fire-element-acupressure-stick/) and the [Water Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/water-element-acupressure-stick/) have floral overtones; one will notice citrus notes in the [Wood Element Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/wood-element-acupressure-stick/) and the [Earth Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/earth-element-acupressure-stick/); the [Metal Element Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/metal-element-acupressure-stick/) is arguably the brashest of the Five Element sticks with strong spicy undertones; the [Head-ease Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/head-ease-acupressure-stick/) will have menthol and lavender influences. It was imperative to use therapeutic amounts of active ingredients, so an aroma-free Aroma Acu-Stick\u00ae is not possible. Yang MH, Lin LC, Wu SC, Chiu JH, Wang PN, Lin JG.
