It is part of a series of books and a website full of information to help you to care for yourself in pregnancy and all through your child's first 5 years. We asked parents what information would help them most during their child's early years. Parents told us that they wanted: common sense information and tips on the general care of their child information about their child's development advice about what to do if their child has a problem details of the people and services to get in touch with for more help and support They also told us they wanted this information to be available online and in a printed version to keep at home. My Child is based on the most up-to-date information available within the health service, and on the experience and knowledge of child health and support services, voluntary organisations and parent groups. Each child is special and unique. Whether you are a new parent or you have done this before, we want to help you every step of the way. As your baby grows and becomes a toddler, their personality will be starting to develop. You can support them to grow to be a healthy, strong, resilient and confident child. All of the information in these books, and more, is online at mychild.ie. We are so grateful to everyone who helped to create these books, especially the parents. This book is the second in a set of three books for parents: My Pregnancy My Child: 0 to 2 years My Child: 2 to 5 years5 5 Health checks for your childHealth checks for your child From birth until the age of 2, you and your baby will usually have 11 planned appointments for healthcare checks and support. Health checks are usually with your GP or your public health nurse. These visits are a great opportunity for you to talk about how you are getting on and ask any questions you have about yourself or your child. Your child will also get vaccines to protect them from different infections. These vaccines and health checks are provided free of charge through the HSE. Did you know? Every child under the age of 6 can get a GP visit card. This means you can take your child to visit your GP for free. The GP visit card also covers them for free assessments at age 2 and 5. It also covers care for children with asthma. You will get reminders about your child's next check. If you have changed your address, please tell your local health centre.

This will be done close to you. Newborn clinical examination Within the first 72 hours after birth, a doctor or midwife with specialist training will also examine your baby. Hearing test (newborn hearing screening) Your baby will also have their hearing checked. During the first weekHeel prick (newborn bloodspot screening) In the first week after your baby is born, you will be offered newborn bloodspot screening. This is also called a heel prick. This may be done by the midwife in the hospital, or by your public health nurse at home. They will gently prick your baby's heel to collect some drops of blood onto a special card. Your baby will be screened to see if they are at risk of a number of rare conditions. Within 72 hours of discharge from hospital or following a home birthMeet your public health nurse Your public health nurse (PHN) will visit you at home to meet and support you and your family. They will usually weigh and examine your baby. The PHN will give advice on feeding, parenting and any questions you may have. They will talk to you about how to keep your baby safe when sleeping. They will also give you general tips about child safety. Check with your public health nurse about any baby clinics at the local HSE health centre. You may be able to call in and have your baby weighed at these clinics. At 2 weeks 2 week baby check Make an appointment with your GP for a 2 week baby check. During this check your GP or the GP practice nurse will examine your baby. This is another opportunity to talk about your baby's wellbeing.7 7 Health checks for your childWhen What happens at the health check At 6 weeks - for you6 week check for you Make an appointment with your GP for the 6 week check.

Cervical screening test Talk to your GP if: you have never had a cervical screening test (smear test) it is more than 3 years since you had one You may be eligible for a free cervical screening test. If you are eligible, this is normally done at least 3 months after the birth. Contraception Ask your GP about contraception if you are not planning to become pregnant at this time. See page 19. Your mood Your GP will ask you about your mood and how you are feeling. This is to see if you have any symptoms of postnatal depression, which is very common. See page 23. Your GP is there to support you. Do not be afraid to be open and honest with them about how you are feeling as they will be able to help.

Parents know their baby best so feel free to discuss any aspect of your baby and their care. They will examine your baby from head to toe. They will also check on their hips, heart, eyes and, for boys, testicles. If you were told at birth that your baby needed a hip ultrasound, then you should have an appointment by now. If you haven't, tell your GP . If your GP can't feel one of your baby boy's testicles, then they will need to be checked again at 6 months of age. This is normally done by a paediatrician. If your GP cannot feel both testicles, they will arrange for an appointment with a paediatrician. At 2 months Vaccines Make an appointment with your GP or GP practice nurse for your baby's first vaccines. This is also called immunisation. See page 102 for more details.

They will check your baby's growth and development. See page 125. They will talk to you about feeding your baby and give you advice about weaning (see page 59).

It is important to take care of yourself during this time of change. Your new life and your new role You will need time to recover from the birth, to rest and to get to know your baby. You will also need time and support to adjust to your new role as a parent. Developing your own parenting style As your baby grows, you will be building patterns and routines that work well for their sleeping, eating and bedtime routines. You will be developing your own parenting style that supports your family. During the first 2 years of your baby's life, you will get a lot of advice from family and friends. You will get to know your baby better than anyone else, so trust your instincts. Love and attention The most important thing you can give your growing baby is your love and attention. This includes: spending time getting to know them developing routines building positive relationships Many parents work outside the home so the time you spend with your baby is important - every moment matters. 11 11 Taking care of yourself as a parentDealing with tiredness While caring for a small child is rewarding, it can be very tiring. Try to get support from your partner or a family member to help with the housework so you have time to focus on your relationship with your baby. Sleep deprivation Sleep deprivation can be difficult. Your days and nights will become easier over time from about 6 weeks on. This is when your baby starts to settle into a routine for feeding and sleeping. But when your baby begins teething at around 6 to 9 months old, sleepless nights may be back again. Support If you feel all of this is getting to be too much, then talk with your partner about ways you can both manage through this time. You may not have a partner to turn to or you may need extra support. Talk to your GP , public health nurse or Tusla (the Child and Family Agency). They may suggest ways to get extra help. See page 28 for details of extra support. Ready to bond From the moment they are born, your baby is ready to form a relationship with you. They love looking at your face and getting to know you. This early relationship is very important for their development. Through you, they are learning about the world. Give yourself time to build and nurture that positive relationship with your baby. Don't worry - a pattern will form in your daily routine that you are able to manage.

In the first few days at home, try to: limit the number of visitors to your home have a rest or a sleep when your baby sleeps ask for and accept help with routine shopping or housework allow some of the housework to go undone for now and focus on your baby and yourself prepare and freeze meals ahead of time to cut down on daily housework Your time You may also feel that you have very little time for yourself since your baby was born. It is important to look after your own needs. This means you will be better able to look after the needs of your family. Take time out for yourself: Ask your partner or a family member to look after your child while you have a short rest. Go for a walk or a swim. Treat yourself to little things such as meeting friends for coffee, a new magazine, a bath. You are learning on the job. Don't expect too much of yourself and those around you. Trust your instincts and know that you are doing your best. Did you know? Parent and toddler groups are when parents and carers come together with their children. This gives an opportunity for children to play and for adults to meet and talk. Families come in all shapes and sizes No matter what your family structure is, children do well when they are loved and cared for in a safe and supportive environment. What matters to children is how they are parented and supported as they grow and develop. All parents face challenges. But some parents may face additional challenges due to their family structure. 13 13 Taking care of yourself as a parentParenting as a couple As you adjust to family life, your relationship can change. Your relationship may strengthen as you get to know your child together. Occasionally tension can arise, especially when one or both of you feel tired and stressed. You may find you have different opinions about certain aspects of parenting. Work out how you will share things including: getting up at night to feed your child sharing the housework or shopping bathing and feeding your child taking time off work to care for your child when they are sick It is common for new mothers not to feel like having sex for a while after the birth.The important thing is that you and your partner talk to each other about your needs. Same-sex couples Parents in same-sex couples face the same challenges as all other parents. There may be some additional challenges such as discrimination or lack of understanding. Chat to your child and explain that families come in different shapes and sizes. Taking care of your relationship Make time for each other - try and do things as a couple. Talk openly together and share your feelings in a calm and listening way. Share the household jobs. Allow your partner to develop their own style of parenting. Avoid arguing in front of your child. Have individual time with your child - this will strengthen your bond with your child while giving the other parent a break.

Shared parenting lets your child build a positive and loving relationship with both parents. Tips include: Keep in touch Support your child to contact their other parent when at home. Encourage this contact when they are with their other parent. They can keep in contact through phone calls or online, for example Skype calls. Make both homes feel special Your child needs to feel at home in both parents' homes. They need both families to love and accept them. Simple things can help. Let your child have a place for their own toothbrush, special blanket and toys. This is a sign that they belong and are not just passing through. Parent together Sometimes you may have a difficult relationship with the other parent. Try not to let this affect your child's relationship with the other parent. As far as possible, both parents should try to stick to the same rules and approach to parenting. Parenting alone There are over 200,000 one parent families in Ireland today. Children thrive when they are loved and cared for. Take time to adjust and adapt to this role - remember that we all learn on the job when it comes to parenting. Focus on your strengths and skills. It is not easy to be a parent so have realistic expectations of yourself. Be kind to yourself - you have a lot to organise and a lot of responsibility. Make sure you make some time for yourself and the things you like to do. We all need help and support - don't be afraid to ask for help and support from family and friends. Parenting after your partner dies The death of a partner is a very difficult and emotional time for you and your family. If you are in this situation, you may feel unable to cope. You may feel uncertain about the future that you had planned together. 15 15 Taking care of yourself as a parentHelp your child to understand what has happened by explaining it to them in a way that is appropriate for their age. Talk to your GP . They can provide you with information on local bereavement support services. They can also help you to work through some of the difficult emotions you may be experiencing at this time. See citizensinformation.ie for advice if you have been bereaved. Older parents Many parents are having children later in life for many reasons. There are both benefits and challenges to having children at any age. At an older age you may have more financial stability and support than you would have had in your 20s and 30s. Despite this you face the same challenges as any parent. You may have extra challenges. Your own parents might be elderly or unwell or you may have teenage children. All parents struggle with energy levels, especially when children are younger and sleep is an issue. All parents need help and support at different times. It is good to talk to parents with children of similar ages as your child. You will be able to share common experiences and challenges. You can get support, advice and friendship. Younger parents As a younger parent, you face similar challenges to any other parent. There may be additional challenges. You might worry about balancing family life with education and finding work. On the other hand, younger parents probably have more energy to deal with the demands of a young child. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie16 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieTaking care of yourself as a parent16 Consider staying with your parents if they are supporting you. If you are living on your own, find out what benefits or entitlements you can get. See citizensinformation.ie There may also be local community supports for parents. Your public health nurse will have information on these. Speak to other parents and parents the same age as you if possible. Like any parent, you will need to take a break - ask your family and friends for help. If you are in school or college, talk to a teacher you trust. This will help them to understand that you have other priorities as well as your education. Talking to your partner, family member or trusted friend can help you deal with the ups and downs of being a parent. Becoming parents after fertility treatments Many parents need fertility treatments to help them to become pregnant. Your journey towards becoming a parent may have been a difficult, expensive and stressful time. Looking after a baby or small child can be exciting and bring great joy. But there is no doubt that it can be challenging at times. Sometimes if you have had IVF or other treatments you may feel guilty when you are stressed and tense. Sometimes you may feel that you should not complain. All new parents need support, no matter how they became parents. For couples who are separating or divorcing Separation or divorce can be stressful for a family. It is normal for you and your child to be upset. You will need to balance dealing with your own emotions and looking after the needs of your child. Caring for yourself during a separation or divorce Get support and help from others, such as family and friends. Look after yourself. Eat, sleep, rest, take exercise and reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. Keep telling yourself that this upsetting time will pass. Be positive about your future. Make realistic plans for yourself and your children. Contact organisations like Tusla (the Child and Family Agency), which offer family mediation and counselling services. These services can help to ease your stress and fears and have a positive impact on your child.17 17 Taking care of yourself as a parentHelping your child through a separation or divorce Love, support and reassure your child. Explain why you are separating or divorcing. Reassure your child that it is because of difficulties in your relationship as a couple and it is not their fault. Both parents need to give the same explanation in a way that is suitable for your child's age. Talk to other adults who are involved in caring for your child. It is important that they are made aware of any big changes in your child's home life. Listen to your child's feelings and the reasons they are angry or sad. Sit down with them so it is easy to make eye contact. Eye contact lets them know that you are listening to them. Try and spend individual time with each child. Simply spending time with your child can encourage them to talk. Encourage them to spend time with their friends doing normal things like playing. What to say: Tell your child that they can still love both parents. They don't have to take sides. Tell your child that it's ok to talk about their feelings, worries or anger. Respect your child - tell them about the process and involve them in decisions as much as you can. Do not speak badly about your partner and why you are separating, despite how you may feel. Your child may feel guilty about loving their other parent while they try to be loyal to you. You may need extra support If you or your child are finding it hard to cope, there are professionals who can help. There is a range of support services available: Citizens Information Centre: 0761 07 4000 and citizensinformation.ie COSC (The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence): whatwouldyoudo.ie Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS): 0761 2000 and mabs.ie Barnardos: 01 453 0355 and barnardos.ie Your GP Your public health nurse Social work services from tusla.ie.

To help you recover, eat healthily and exercise regularly. Going on a weight loss diet is not recommended just after you have given birth, especially if you are breastfeeding. Healthy eating is always important, especially after giving birth. Use the food pyramid to help you choose a daily balanced diet - choose 3 servings of dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt every day. Eat foods high in fibre to avoid constipation, especially if you had stitches or bruising. Examples include vegetables, fruit and wholemeal or wholegrain varieties of bread, cereals, pasta or rice. Aim to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day. If you are breastfeeding you will need 11 to 14 glasses of water a day.19 19 Taking care of yourself as a parentSmoking and drinking alcohol If you gave up smoking during your pregnancy, you gave your baby a great start. Try to stay off cigarettes as smoking around your baby increases their risk of cot death. Quitting smoking is one of the best ways to protect your own health and wellbeing. Free help and support that can double your chances of quitting is available from the HSE on quit.ie. See askaboutalcohol.ie for information on alcohol and your health. For advice about drinking alcohol while breastfeeding, see page 36. Physical activity Just as it took time to grow your pregnancy, it will take time for your body to recover. Try and be patient and be kind to yourself. Taking regular physical exercise is good for your general health and will improve your sense of wellbeing. Some gentle exercises can help increase your energy levels and help you manage the added work in your life following the birth of your baby. Build physical activity into your daily routine by going for a walk with your baby. Inviting someone along gives you a chance to spend time together. Go swimming once you feel ready. You may need to wait for any stitches to heal and bleeding to stop. Pelvic floor exercises Pelvic floor exercises are when you squeeze the muscles around your vagina and anus to strengthen them. It is important to begin pelvic floor muscle exercises as soon as possible after the birth of your baby. These are important to prevent future health problems such as leakage of urine (incontinence). Your midwife or physiotherapist will give you information about how to do pelvic floor muscle exercises. Do these exercises regularly. If you had a caesarean birth, a physiotherapist will give you information on suitable exercises. Contraception It is possible to become pregnant again soon after the birth of your baby, even if your periods have not returned. If you do not want to get pregnant now, you and your partner can decide on a method of family planning that suits you both. You can get information on family planning and contraception from your midwife, GP , public health nurse or GP practice nurse. See sexualwellbeing.ie The baby blues Soon after the birth of your baby it is normal to feel very tearful and emotional. You may find it is hard to explain why you are crying, or why you feel upset. This is called the baby blues. See page 22. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie20 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieTaking care of yourself as a parent20A new brother or sister in the family This is a time of change for older children in your family. While they may be excited by a new brother or sister, they may feel jealous at times. An older child may go back to baby behaviour for a time, such as wanting a bottle or breastfeed, or asking to be lifted up. It will take time and patience to cope with the extra demands. There are ways to help them to adjust to their new brother or sister: If possible, spend some individual time with your older child. This may help to make them feel secure and adjust to their new position in their family. Encourage your older child or children to become involved in caring for your baby. If this does not happen, don't try to force it. This will happen in time. Talk to your older child about how great it is becoming a big brother or sister. Don't make any major changes to your older child's life. For example, do not start potty training or stop the use of soothers shortly after your new baby's arrival. Breastfeeding may be a time when your older child may feel excluded. It's a good idea to have a special box of toys or books that you bring out during breastfeeding for them to play with. It may be possible to tandem feed (breastfeeding your baby and an older child) for a while. You can get more information about this from your local breastfeeding group. See page 42.21 21 Taking care of yourself as a parentCaring for twins or more Bringing your babies home from hospital is both an exciting and daunting experience. In the early days you may miss the support of the hospital. Your GP and public health nurse are there to support you. You can also phone the hospital where you gave birth for more help. Feeding You will get support in the hospital on how to breastfeed twins. It is possible to breastfeed when you have more than one baby. It has lots of health benefits for you and your babies. Breastfeeding can also be a great help in soothing your babies. It also helps you to build a strong bond with them. Dividing your attention between 2 or more babies can feel overwhelming at times. You may want to express and store your milk so your partner can help you with the feeds. If you have decided to formula feed, you will be given information on making feeds. Some mothers find feeding both babies at the same time easier. This is called tandem feeding. Tips for twins and multiple babies Develop a routine that suits you around the basic needs of your babies - feeding, sleeping and playing. Make feeding a special time where you start to build a relationship with your babies. Take time to talk to your babies and learn from their signals when they want to be fed and when they have had enough. Include your other children - for example, making time for storytelling. There is no need to bathe your babies every day - 2 or 3 times a week is fine. Bathe your babies on alternative nights to make it a special time. This helps you to spend good quality time with each baby and get to know their personalities. Accept offers of help from family and friends so you can rest and have some time for yourself. Make your home a no smoking zone - do not let anyone smoke around your babies, no matter where they are. Support Your midwives, public health nurse, GP or maternity hospital are there to help. The Irish Multiple Births Association has information and support on a range of topics for parents of twins, triplets or more. See imba.ie or phone 01 874 9056.

Having a newborn baby is exhilarating, exhausting and physically challenging. The sense of responsibility can be daunting. You may have feelings of inadequacy and guilt. This can feel overwhelming. Many mothers feel changes in their emotions and mood at some point in their pregnancy and in the first few weeks after birth. This is a normal part of adjusting to the changes of becoming a mother. Baby blues The baby blues are very common and considered normal. It happens to about 80% of women. Most new mothers feel baby blues a few days after the birth. They usually begin 2 to 3 days after the birth. They are sometimes called the '2 day tears' or the 'day 3 blues'. The baby blues are linked to the sudden drop of hormones that you experience after giving birth. On top of all these hormonal changes, you are trying to get used to a new baby. It can take a few days for your hormones to realign after giving birth. Signs of baby blues You might be more tearful and emotional than normal. You may be irritable. You might feel isolated, vulnerable and lonely. You can also feel \"high\" and elated or very happy during this time.

It is important that your loved one with postnatal depression gets treatment as soon as possible.

Be there Simply being there, offering your time, support and encouragement can really help a person who is depressed. Listen to her. Reassure her that she will get better. Help her to get help Many mothers with postnatal depression are reluctant to get help. This is for lots of reasons. Reassure her Tell her how common postnatal depression is. Tell her that she needs help, and that she will feel better soon. Listen to her. What are her concerns? Offer to go with her to the GP if she would like. Know when to get help urgently Always make sure that anyone with postnatal depression gets help quickly if they talk about harming themselves or the baby. She will need to be seen urgently by her GP . Do not delay. Encourage her to see the GP and go with her. If she does not agree to go, contact your GP for advice on what to do. Help her to look after herself Make sure she gets enough rest. Prepare food and snacks to encourage her to eat. Encourage her to go for a walk or take some form of exercise, as this is proven to help with depression. Practical help Help with housework, shopping, cooking and caring for the baby.

There may be challenges but there is support and help available. Talk to your public health nurse if you have any concerns about feeding. See page 42 for information on breastfeeding support. Responsive feeding Responsive parenting is an important part of forming a healthy relationship with your baby. It means that you are responding sensitively to your baby while accepting their needs and signals. This type of parenting helps your baby to form healthy brain connections and encourages feelings of safety and comfort. Your baby loves when you hold them close. It comforts your baby and helps them feel secure. You can do responsive feeding by responding to your baby when they are showing signs of: hunger (early feeding cues) - see page 32 distress Tips for responsive breastfeeding Feed your baby whenever they show signs of wanting to breastfeed. Respond to your baby's early feeding cues. Do not try to time the feeds or feed to a schedule. Remember that you are not 'spoiling' your baby by responding to their needs in this way. Tips for responsive bottle-feeding Your baby will love it if you or your partner do most of the feeds - they know you best. Gently encourage the baby to root and invite them to take the teat. Pace the feed or go at your baby's pace - try not to rush. Never force your baby to take a full feed. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie32 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby32Did you know? It's normal for babies to lose weight in the first few days after birth. After this they begin gaining weight and by 2 weeks of age they are usually back at their birth weight. Breastfeeding Your breast milk is all your baby needs for the first 6 months and it is then part of their wider diet as they grow. Breastfeeding is soothing and comforting for your baby and creates a special closeness. It gives you a chance to rest with your baby and to get to know them. Breastfeeding: protects your health and your baby's health is important for your baby's healthy growth and development provides antibodies to protect your baby from illness and build their immune system helps you to be a healthy weight reduces your risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and diabetes Breastfeeding helps protect your baby from: ear, chest, nose and tummy infections obesity (being very overweight) diabetes cot death Early feeding cues It is best to feed your baby when they show signs of being hungry. These are called early feeding cues. Cues include: eyes fluttering or moving over and back, even if their eyelids are closed moving their hands to their mouth or towards their face opening and closing their mouth 'rooting' \u2014 turning their head when you touch their cheek, or trying to move towards your breast making cooing noises33 33 Feeding your babyCrying is a late sign of hunger or late feeding cue. Try feeding when you notice the earlier signs. It will be easier as you will both be calmer and more relaxed. Breastfeeding positions Before you start breastfeeding, find a comfortable position. There are very few rules but it is important that you and your baby are positioned comfortably. Have a glass of water close to hand, and perhaps a snack. Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes practice. See mychild.ie for step-by-step guides on different breastfeeding positions. Attaching your baby to your breast Positioning and attachment is about how you hold your baby at your breast so they can feed. This is also called latching on. Proper positioning and attachment is the most important thing for successful breastfeeding. When your baby is well positioned and attached, they will find it easier to feed well and you will find it more comfortable. In the early days, you may feel sensitive at the beginning of a feed as you get used to the new feeling. Feeding should not be painful. Get help with positioning and attaching from your public health nurse, midwife, lactation consultant or voluntary breastfeeding organisation if you continue to feel discomfort. Follow these steps to position and attach your baby well. 1. Hold your baby close with their nose level with your nipple. 2. Let your baby's head tip back so their top lip brushes against your nipple \u2014 this should help them open their mouth wide.Attachment: The key to successful breastfeeding You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie34 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby343. When your baby's mouth is wide open, bring them to your breast. 4. Aim your nipple to the roof of their mouth. 5. When they attach, your nipple and most of the areola (the area around your nipple) should be deep in your baby's mouth. 6. When your baby is attached properly, their chin will be pressed into your breast. 7. Your baby's nose should be clear for easy breathing. Ideally, the nose should be at a tilt when attached correctly. 8. If your baby's nose appears to be blocked, move their bottom closer to you. This will create a head tilt and free up their nose. 9. The deeper the attachment, the more comfortable you will feel and the better your baby will feed. How to know your baby is attached correctly Signs that your baby is attached correctly: Head position Your baby should have a wide mouthful of breast in their mouth. More of your areola will be visible above their top lip than below their bottom lip. Their chin should be touching your breast. You may notice their top and bottom lips curled out. Their cheeks should be full and rounded, you should not see the cheeks dimpling when baby sucks. Their jaw should be moving, you may also see their ears twitch as they feed. Sucks and sounds They will start with short quick sucks, then change to long deep sucks with pauses to breathe. You should hear them swallowing as your breast milk volume increases. You should not hear smacking or clicking sounds. Calm and comfortable They should feed calmly and not move on and off the breast. You will feel comfortable during a feed and your nipples should not be sore. When they finish feeding, they should seem satisfied. Breastfeeding during the first 4 weeks Newborn babies have tiny tummies. They can feed 10 to 12 times in 24 hours. Your milk is very easy for your baby to digest. In the first few weeks, you and your baby are getting used to breastfeeding. This is called establishing breastfeeding. Your supply of breast milk is established in the early weeks. This works by supply and demand. The more you breastfeed, the more milk your body produces.35 35 Feeding your babyTo make sure you have a good supply of milk: Feed your baby often when they show early feeding cues. Let your baby feed as long as they wish. When your baby is finished feeding, they will come off your breast. You can then offer your second breast. If your baby does not take this breast, offer it first at the next feed. Feeding patterns Some babies feed more at certain times of the day, often in the evening. This is normal. Breastfeeding is a skill that you and your baby will develop over the first few weeks. As the weeks pass, your baby may develop a more regular pattern of feeding. From around 4 weeks of age you and your baby will have breastfeeding well established. Getting into a routine You may start to notice that your day is falling into a fairly predictable routine. Every baby's pattern will differ, and it may change from time to time with occasional growth spurts. The longer they breastfeed, the easier it becomes. It is normal for babies to wake at night for feeds. As your baby grows, they may settle and sleep for longer periods at night. Soothers Try not to give your baby a soother, dummy or dodie until breastfeeding is established, usually when your baby is 1 month old. Using soothers has been shown to reduce the amount of breast milk your body makes. It may interfere with your baby attaching correctly onto your breast.Breastfeeding at night gives your baby a large part of their calorie intake before they begin eating solid foods. It helps maintain your milk supply. Babies and toddlers also breastfeed for: comfort security warmth closeness familiarity It is common for babies and toddlers to wake at night (see pages 79 to 81).

Breastfeeding is thirsty work so make sure you are drinking plenty of water. Being a new mother is busy and can be hard work. Try to have a healthy and balanced diet to make sure you are getting all of the nutrients you need. A healthy and balanced diet means: at least 5 to 7 servings of vegetables, salad and fruit each day wholegrain bread, pasta, rice or potatoes plenty of fibre to prevent constipation \u2014 wholegrains, beans, lentils, fruit and vegetables protein such as lean meat, poultry, fish and eggs dairy foods such as milk, cheese and yoghurts Try to have healthy snacks ready to grab for when you get hungry. Examples include: fresh fruit yoghurts hummus and vegetables to dip like carrots and celery sandwiches dried fruit like raisins, apricots and prunes breakfast cereals or muesli that are fortified with vitamins baked beans on toast baked potato with cheese boiled eggs What to avoid Alcohol It's best to avoid drinking alcohol until your baby is more than 1 month old. In the first few weeks, you and your baby are getting used to breastfeeding. This is called establishing breastfeeding. If you choose to drink alcohol once breastfeeding is established, there are steps you can take to avoid passing alcohol to your baby through your milk: feed your baby before drinking alcohol express your breast milk if you plan to drink more than 2 standard drinks - 1 standard drink is a half a pint of beer, a single measure of spirits or a small glass of wine wait 2 hours after each standard drink before breastfeeding your baby37 37 Feeding your baby do not drink more than 11 standard drinks a week spread your drinks over the week have at least 2 alcohol-free days per week You may not be able to take care of your baby properly if you are affected by alcohol. Only time makes alcohol leave your body and your milk. Drinking water or expressing your breast milk will not clear the alcohol from your body any faster. Breastfeeding while there is alcohol in your breast milk can affect your baby's sleep. Caffeine Drinks containing caffeine like tea, coffee and energy drinks may keep your baby awake. Keep your caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day, the same as when you were pregnant. Examples of foods and drinks containing caffeine include: 1 mug of filter coffee - 140 mg caffeine 1 mug of instant coffee - 100 mg caffeine 1 mug of tea - 75 mg caffeine 1 can of energy drink can have up to 160 mg caffeine, depending on the size 1 cola drink tends to have 40 mg caffeine Fish Oily fish contains special types of fat. These are called long chain omega fatty acids. These fats are really good for your baby's developing nervous system. But some oily fish can contain low levels of pollutants. These can build up in your body. If you are breastfeeding, don't have more than two portions of oily fish each week. You should not eat more than one portion of marlin, swordfish or shark per week. This is because these fish can contain high levels of mercury. There is no limit to how much tuna you can eat when breastfeeding.

Check with your GP , any doctor who is treating you or pharmacist. Keep all medication out of your child's sight and reach. Breastfeeding challenges Breastfeeding is a skill that mothers and babies learn together. Like any skill, it takes practice and patience. Things that help to prevent breastfeeding challenges: Feed your baby frequently when they show early feeding cues (see page 32). Make sure your baby is positioned and attached deeply onto your breast for comfort. If you do have any breastfeeding challenges, you are not alone. Ask for help (see page 42). There is almost always a solution. Sore or bleeding nipples If your nipples are sore or bleeding, get help. Ask your lactation consultant, public health nurse or GP practice nurse to check that your baby is correctly positioned and attached to the breast. They will help you to: become more comfortable feeding treat sore nipples If the position you use when feeding your baby or the way your baby is attached to your breast isn't the cause of the problem, they will advise you about treatment. Other causes may include tongue-tie (see page 41) or thrush (see page 40). Tips If the position you use when feeding your baby or the way your baby is attached to your breast is causing your problems, some of the following tips may help: After each feed, hand express (see page 44) some milk. Gently rub the milk into the nipple area. Let this dry before covering again. Gently massage your nipples with warm fingers and 100% lanolin nipple ointment - follow the instructions and make sure you are in a warm room. Spread a small amount of 100% lanolin nipple cream on a clean dry breastpad and place over the nipple. Change the breastpad frequently (read the instructions) to prevent moisture staying on your skin. Use a hydrogel compress - ask your pharmacist for advice on which types are suitable for breastfeeding women and follow the instructions. If it feels too painful to feed, you could pump milk (see page 45) for a day or two. This gives your nipples time to heal. Hand expressing (page 44) may be more comfortable than using a pump. !39 39 Feeding your babyUnsettled feeding Unsettled feeding means your baby is fussing or crying at the breast. Ask for help from your lactation consultant, public health nurse, midwife or neonatal nurse about the best ways to correctly position and attach your baby to your breast. When your baby has finished the first breast, try offering your second breast at each feed. Engorgement Breast engorgement is when your breasts get too full of milk. This can leave them feeling hard and painful. Engorgement can happen in the early days of feeding. It can take a few days for your supply of breast milk to match what your baby needs. It can also happen later on, for example when you introduce solid foods to your baby and your baby starts to drink less breast milk. Ask your public health nurse, GP practice nurse or lactation consultant for help if you think your breasts are engorged. They can show you how to express a little milk by hand before a feed to soften your breast and help your baby to attach (see page 33). Other tips include: Wear a well-fitting bra designed for breastfeeding mothers (nursing bra). Apply warm flannels to your breasts before a feed or before you hand express. Keep cabbage leaves in the fridge and put them on your breasts after a feed. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with the pain - ask your pharmacist for advice. Blocked ducts If you have a blocked duct, you will usually notice an area of your breast that is sore. You might feel a hard and tender lump when you press your breast. You will generally feel well. A blocked duct can happen when the milk is not flowing freely from that milk duct in your breast. Causes can include wearing a bra that is too tight, incorrect positioning and attachment or missing a feed. Mastitis Mastitis means you have an inflammation in one of your breasts. This can happen when a blocked duct is not relieved. If you have mastitis, your breast can feel painful and inflamed. If mastitis is not treated, it can become infected and you will need to take antibiotics. If you have mastitis, you may have: a red patch of skin on your breast that is painful to touch a high fever flu-like symptoms - feeling generally unwell, achy and tired You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie40 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby40You may also feel tearful. Ask your public health nurse, GP practice nurse, midwife, neonatal nurse, or lactation consultant to check that your baby is correctly positioned and attached to your breast. Tips for blocked ducts and mastitis Some tips to help a blocked duct or mastitis include: Feed more often and feed from the affected breast first. If your baby cannot feed, express from that side. Warm up your breast with a hot wet flannel before feeding. If you have mastitis only, cool your breast with a cold flannel after the feed. Massage your breast while your baby is feeding. Rest and take a painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen - ask your pharmacist for advice. See your GP if there is no improvement after 12 to 24 hours or if things are getting worse. Thrush Usually the baby will get thrush first and pass it to their mother. Thrush is caused by candida, which is a type of yeast. Symptoms Symptoms include your nipples suddenly becoming sore and bright pink. Your nipple may be: shiny or flaky sore after a breastfeed or at night Symptoms of thrush in your baby include: creamy white patches or white spots which cannot be removed in the mouth, on the tongue or in the cheeks their tongue or lips may have a white or pearly gloss a nappy rash - this happens to some babies What to do See your GP if you think you or your baby has thrush. Bring your baby with you. You will both need to be treated at the same time. Your GP may prescribe an ointment, cream or gel. Other tips: You may take a probiotic to help the treatment - ask your pharmacist for advice. If using breast pads, make sure you change them after every feed. Make sure you and your family wash your hands properly \u2014 thrush can be passed on to the baby and other family members. Use separate towels. Wash clothes in a 60 degree wash.41 41 Feeding your baby If you are expressing breast milk, do not freeze it. Wait until you have finished treatment and are symptom-free before you express milk for freezing. Go to your public health nurse, lactation consultant or local breastfeeding support group for help with positioning and attachment. Tongue-tie Some babies with tongue-tie are not able to move and stretch their tongues freely. This may interfere with positioning and attachment onto the breast. What it is Tongue-tie happens when the frenulum (the strip of skin that attaches the tongue to the base of the mouth) is too short, tight or thick. Signs and difficulties Tongue-tie can reduce the amount of breast milk your baby gets. It can also reduce your supply of breast milk. Signs of tongue-tie include: difficulties in getting your baby properly attached to the breast and keeping them there your baby losing weight or having difficulty gaining weight restless, tiring and unsettled feeds noisy or clicking sounds during the feed dribbling of milk during feeds Difficulties for mothers include: distorted nipple shape after a breastfeed nipple pain and bleeding, damaged or ulcerated nipples engorgement (where your breasts feel very full, and sometimes quite hard) mastitis What to do See your lactation consultant, public health nurse, midwife or GP if you think your baby has tongue-tie. Better positioning and attachment can help with feeding challenges. Some babies may need a frenotomy. This is where the frenulum causing the tongue-tie is released in a minor operation. Leaks Sometimes breast milk may leak from your nipples. If you use breast pads, change them at every feed.

Where you can breastfeed You can breastfeed anywhere you and your baby wants and needs to. This is your right. You don't have to ask permission to breastfeed in any premises. Some places may offer a private area if you would like this, but you don't have to use it. The Equal Status Act (2000) protects mothers from being discriminated against or harassed because they are breastfeeding in a public area. What to wear Wear trousers or a skirt with a jumper, sweatshirt or t-shirt that you can pull up from the waist. If possible wear a nursing bra that you can open from the front with one hand. Look for cues Don't wait until your baby gets too hungry or distressed. Feed your baby early and you will both be more relaxed and feeding will go smoothly. Breastfeeding offers comfort as well as food. That's why breastfed babies are often more easily settled. Expressing breast milk Expressing means removing milk from your breast so you can store it and feed it to your baby later. You remove the milk by hand or with a breast pump. In the first few days after the birth it is best to hand express. Expressing your breast milk is a very useful skill to learn. In the early days, you may want to express milk if: Your baby needs to be cared for in a special care baby unit or paediatric hospital. You or your baby are too ill to breastfeed after birth. Your breasts feel very full or uncomfortable. Your baby is having difficulty attaching onto your breast. As your baby grows, you may want to express milk when you are going to be away from your baby. Expressing means that during the time you're away from your baby you will: be able to relieve the fullness in your breasts. have milk for your baby's carer.

When you express, it can be helpful to close your eyes and imagine your baby is feeding at your breast. Thinking of your baby or looking at a photo or video of them can help you relax and connect with your baby before you begin expressing. Having their clothing or blanket with you can also help. If possible, spend some time together in skin-to-skin contact before you begin to express. Hand-expressing breast milk Getting ready Find a comfortable place to express. Minimise distractions. Wash your hands. Have everything you need to hand - for example, a drink of water, snack and a small towel. Think about your baby. Warm your breasts - take a warm shower or put a warm facecloth (warm compress or flannel) on your breasts. Massage your breasts before expressing - you can do this while in the shower. Massage Massage your breasts. This encourages the release of hormones and helps get your milk flowing. 1. Start by washing your hands in warm water. 2. Gently massage your breast. 3. This can be done with your fingertips (as shown in image A) or by rolling your closed fist over your breast towards the nipple (as shown in image B). 4. Work around the whole breast, including underneath. Don't slide your fingers along your breast as it can damage the skin. A B C45 45 Feeding your baby5. After massaging your breast, gently roll your nipple between your first finger and thumb (as shown in image C). 6. You can then press and release your breast. Use rhythmic movements. When you press down and release, a small drop of breast milk appears. Do not rub or slide along your nipple as this may hurt. 7. Continue to press and release. After a while, a few drops of breastmilk appears. Collect this in a clean container or syringe. 8. Continue then to press, release and collect. Using a breast pump If you're regularly separated from your baby or if there is a delay in breastfeeding after birth, your midwife may recommend using a breast pump to express your milk. You may also need to use a breast pump if your baby is unable to attach onto your breast. For example, if they were born sick or premature or having challenges attaching to your breast. How to express using a breast pump Breast pumps are generally hand-operated or electric (powered by batteries or mains electricity). Hand-operated pumps work by creating suction when you squeeze the handle or collection container. This may become tiring after a while, so take your time. Breast pumps may consist of just a collection unit or a two-part collection and storage unit. Cleaning and sterilising The collection set and storage container of the breast pump needs to be cleaned after every use. They should be completely dismantled, washed in hot soapy water and rinsed. Air-dry thoroughly or dry with paper towels. Some manufacturers recommend to sterilise collection and storage containers once a day. Always follow manufacturer's instructions. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie46 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby46What you need Prepare everything before you start expressing. You will need: a clean collection set a clean container for milk storage a breast pump labels and a pen for labelling containers a comfortable chair to sit in while expressing a sink with hot running water to wash your hands before putting the pump together a facecloth or warm compress to help massage your breasts before expressing a small towel to catch any drips a drink of water close to hand - you may also want a snack within arm's reach Give yourself plenty of time and try not to feel rushed. How to use an electric breast pump 1. Wash and dry your hands. 2. Assemble the pump and connect the tubing (if applicable) to the collection set and container. 3. Make sure that the breast pump pressure is set to the minimum setting. 4. Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported. 5. Place a warm compress (such as a facecloth or flannel) over the breast and massage for 3 to 5 minutes. 6. Position the funnel of the collection set so that your nipple is in the centre. 7. Hold the funnel so that the pump can create a vacuum but try not to press too firmly into the breast tissue as this can prevent milk flow. 8. Turn on the breast pump. 9. Keep the breast pump pressure at the minimum setting for 2 minutes to help stimulate your milk flow. 10. Gradually increase the pressure on the breast pump to the highest pressure that is comfortable for you (this should never be painful). 11. Continue to express until the flow of milk slows down. 12. Turn off the breast pump and, once the suction is released, remove the funnel of the collection set from your breast. 13. Repeat with the second breast. Sometimes a pump may have double collection sets and containers so you can pump both breasts. 14. When finished, put the lid on the storage container or pour the milk into the storage containers. 15. Label with date and time. 16. Wash and dry the collection set to get it ready for next use. See page 45.47 47 Feeding your babyHow to use a hand pump 1. Wash and dry your hands. 2. Assemble the pump. 3. Make sure you are in a comfortable position with your back supported. 4. Begin pumping slowly with even pressure. 5. Increase the pressure gradually (this should never be painful). 6. When finished, put the lid on the storage container or pour the milk into a storage container. 7. Label with the date and time. 8. Wash and dry the pump to get it ready for the next use. See page 45. Storing expressed breast milk Use a washed container. Any container will do as long as it has an airtight seal and can be washed or sterilised and labelled easily. You may also choose to use disposable one-use breast milk storage bags. Label each container with date and time. You can keep stored milk: Heating expressed breast milk When you are expressing, the breast milk should be chilled or frozen as quickly as possible. Follow these guidelines for defrosting and warming up expressed breast milk. Defrosting frozen milk Breast milk can be defrosted in the fridge, normally in around 12 hours. Alternatively, hold the bottle or bag of frozen milk under warm running water (a maximum of 37\u00b0C or 99\u00b0F). Don't leave frozen breast milk to defrost at room temperature.Once fully thawed, previously frozen breast milk may be kept at room temperature for a maximum of 2 hours or in the fridge for up to 24 hours. sealed outside of the fridge for up to 4 hours in temperatures less than 20 degrees in a fridge for up to 5 days (place it at the back of the shelf above the vegetable compartment and not inside the door) in the icebox in your fridge for up to 2 weeks in a fridge freezer for 3 months in a deep freezer for up to 6 months You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie48 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby48Don't thaw or heat frozen breast milk in a microwave or in boiling water. These can damage its nutritional and protective qualities and create hot spots that could scald your baby. Thawed breast milk left at room temperature should be fed to your baby within 2 hours or thrown away. Never re-freeze breast milk once thawed. Warming up milk Healthy full-term babies can drink breast milk at room temperature or warmed to body temperature. Some have a preference, others don't seem to mind. To warm your milk, place the breast milk bottle or bag into a cup, jug or bowl of lukewarm water for a few minutes to bring it to body temperature (37\u00b0C or 99\u00b0F). Alternatively, use a bottle warmer. Do not allow the temperature to go above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Do not use a microwave, as this can overheat your milk.Gently swirl the bottle or bag, without shaking or stirring, to mix any separated fat. Stopping breastfeeding You can continue to breastfeed when your baby starts eating solid foods, until your baby is up 2 years of age and beyond. You can stop when it suits you and your child. If you choose to stop breastfeeding before they start eating solid foods, do it slowly. Speak with your public health nurse, GP , GP practice nurse or go to your local breastfeeding support group for information and support. How to stop breastfeeding 1. Drop a breastfeed every 2 to 3 days for the first few weeks. Begin with the feeds during the day. 2. Give your child a feed from a cup or bottle during the times you do not offer breast milk. 3. After your child gets used to this new routine, stop another of the daily breastfeeds. 4. Keep doing this feed by feed, until your supply of breast milk has stopped completely. If your breasts feel hard and uncomfortable at any stage, try hand expressing a little milk (see page 44) - just enough so you feel comfortable. If you are concerned about your breasts or about stopping breastfeeding, or about your own supply of breast milk, contact your local supports (see above).49 49 Feeding your babyFormula-feeding Talk to your midwife or public health nurse if breastfeeding did not go as planned or you have chosen to formula feed. There are a number of options available. You can express breast milk, use a combination of formula and breast milk or use formula alone. Your nurse or midwife will give you information on all these options, including how to safely prepare formula for your baby (see page 50). Formula milk is also known as formula feed, baby formula or infant formula. Most formula milk is made from cow's milk. It comes in powdered form or in 'ready to feed' cartons. Like any food, powdered infant formula is not sterile and may contain bacteria. This is why equipment like bottles and teats need to be sterilised (page 50). Types of formula milk First infant formula First infant formula is the type of formula recommended for newborns. This should always be the formula you use and is recommended until your baby is 12 months old. Hungry baby milk Hungry baby formula contains more casein than whey. Casein is a protein that is harder for babies to digest. It's often described as suitable for 'hungrier babies'. There is no evidence that hungry baby milk helps babies settle better. Follow-on formula Follow-on formula is sometimes called 'number 2 milk'. Switching to follow-on formula at 6 months has no benefits for your baby. From 6 months you should begin weaning to solids (see page 59) and aim for a healthy balanced diet. Your baby can carry on having first infant formula as their main drink until they are 12 months old. Other types of milk Do not give a baby under the age of 1: regular cow's milk as a drink - it can be used when preparing food (see page 60) sheep's milk goat's milk condensed milk plant-based milks such as oat, soya, almond or rice milk You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie50 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby50Soy formula Do not use soy formula unless it has been prescribed by your paediatrician or GP . Bonding during bottle feeds Feeding is a great chance for you and your baby to get to know each other. Make the most of this bonding time by: staying in close contact - consider opening your shirt and doing skin to skin looking into your baby's eyes and they will often look back at you - this helps them feel safe and loved taking it slowly and enjoying the cuddles resisting the urge to multi-task - this is your time with your baby Always use your arm and hand to bottle feed. Never prop the bottle, for example on a cushion, as it increases the risk of your baby choking. It could also reduce bonding time. What you need To prepare formula milk correctly, you will need: a clean work surface facilities to wash your hands and equipment at least 6 bottles, lids and teats formula powder suitable water (see page 52) and a way to boil it a bottle brush and a small teat brush sterilising equipment like a steam, chemical or microwave kit tongs to help you grip the equipment If you have a visual impairment, use wide-necked bottles. They are easier to fill. Sterilising equipment You must sterilise all feeding equipment until your baby is at least 12 months old. Incorrect preparation or bad hygiene could make your baby seriously ill. !51 51 Feeding your babyCleaning Clean and sterilise all feeding equipment before you use it. Follow these steps to clean the equipment: 1. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Dry your hands with a clean towel. 2. Wash all the feeding equipment in hot soapy water, such as the bottles, teats, lids and tongs. 3. Use a clean bottle brush and teat brush to scrub the inside and outside of the bottles and teats to make sure you remove any leftover milk from the hard-to-reach places. 4. Rinse the bottles and teats well in clean running water. Types of sterilisers You can use boiling water, a chemical steriliser or a steam kit to sterilise equipment. A steam steriliser is the best. You can get plug-in or microwaveable sterilisers too. If using boiling water Fill a large saucepan with tap water and make sure all equipment is completely covered by the liquid. Make sure there are no trapped air bubbles. Cover the saucepan and bring it to the boil. Boil for at least three minutes. Make sure the feeding equipment is fully covered with boiling water at all times. Keep the saucepan covered until you need to use the equipment. Putting bottles together after sterilising 1. Make sure your hands and the work surface are clean. 2. Touching only the outside of the collar, place it over the teat and use sterile tongs to pull the teat through the collar. 3. Screw the collar onto the bottle and tighten fully. 4. Place the cap over the bottle, being sure not to touch the inside of the cap when doing this. 5. Store the bottles in a clean place. If put together correctly the empty bottles and bottles with sterile water will be safe for 24 hours. If not used within 24 hours, sterilise again. Once you open a bottle to add water or powder it is not sterile. Keep all sterilising equipment and hot water out of reach of children. Dishwashers do not sterilise bottles or feeding equipment.!

Know the safety of your local water supply. Your local water supply Public water supplies and large private group water schemes are regulated by European law and are safe to drink unless you are told otherwise. If you use water from a private well, you should check that it is safe to drink. See epa.ie for householder information on private wells and information on drinking water on hse.ie. Using tap or bottled water Tap water is usually safe to use. But there may be times that you need to use bottled water. For example if: you are travelling abroad you have a private well and are not sure that the water is safe to drink there is a 'boil notice' on your local water supply, or you have a water softener system Water softener system If you have a water softener which uses salt (ion-exchange softener), only use water that has not been through the softener for making up your baby's bottles. There should be a single extra tap to your kitchen sink supplying 'unsoftened water' that you can use for drinking, cooking and making up your baby's bottles. If you are not sure which tap to use, it might be safest to use bottled water until you find out. When using bottled water to make up a bottle feed Use still water only. Never use fizzy or sparkling water. It is best not to use bottled water labeled as 'natural mineral water' to make up your baby's feeds as it can have high levels or sodium (salt) and other minerals. If this is the only water available, use it for the shortest time possible. It is important that your baby gets enough to drink. Bottled water is not sterile. Always boil bottled water to make up formula. Use a kettle or saucepan to get a rolling boil for 1 minute. Cool in the normal way. Do not boil the same water again.53 53 Feeding your babyHow to make up a formula feed 1. Empty your kettle and fill it with one litre (1l) of freshly drawn cold tap water and boil. Alternatively, boil one litre (1l) of water in a clean saucepan. 2. Leave the boiled water to cool in the kettle or saucepan. Cool it for 30 minutes, but no longer. This will make sure that the water is not too hot, but also that it is no less than 70\u00b0C. 3. Clean the work surface well. Wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them on a clean towel. 4. Read the instructions on the formula's label carefully to find out how much water and powder you need. 5. Pour the correct amount of water into a sterilised bottle. Water that is 70\u00b0C is still hot enough to scald, so be careful. 6. Add the exact amount of formula to the boiled water using the clean scoop provided. Reseal the packaging to protect it from germs and moisture. 7. Screw the bottle lid tightly and shake well to mix the contents. 8. To cool the feed quickly, hold the bottle under cold running water or place it in a large bowl of cold water. Make sure that the cold water does not reach above the neck of the bottle. 9. To check the feed is not too hot, shake the bottle and place a drop of liquid on the inside of the wrist - it should feel lukewarm, not hot. Feed your baby. 10. Throw away any feed that your baby has not taken within 2 hours. If your baby is a slow feeder use a fresh feed after 2 hours. Measuring exact amounts It is important to measure the formula and water carefully. Too much or too little formula can cause health problems. For each 30mls (each ounce) of water, you need 1 level scoop of formula powder. This means the powder should not pile up higher than the side of the scoop. Use the scoop in the formula box. Many formula containers have a leveller stick to help. If not, use a clean knife to level the scoop. For example, if you are making up a 90mls (3 ounce) feed, you will need to add 3 level scoops of formula to 90mls of water that has been boiled and then cooled for 30 minutes. Automatic formula makers The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) does not recommend the use of formula preparation machines or automatic machines to prepare bottles of powdered infant formula. There is not enough research to support the safety of these machines. Preparing feeds in advance To safely store made-up bottles: make up bottles following steps 1 to 8 above place cooled bottles in the back of the fridge You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie54 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby54 make sure the temperature of the fridge is 5\u00b0C or less throw away any feed not used within 24 hours - this helps to protect your baby from illness such as gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhoea) Never use a microwave to warm feeds. Microwaves heat unevenly and may cause 'hot spots' that could scald your baby's mouth How to warm up refrigerated bottle feeds 1. Remove the bottle from the fridge just before you need it. 2. To warm it, place it in a bowl of warm water, making sure the level of the water is below the neck of the bottle. You can also use a bottle-warmer. 3. Do not warm it for more than 15 minutes. 4. Check the temperature of the milk by dripping a little onto the inside of your wrist. It should feel lukewarm, not hot. 5. Throw away any feed that your baby has not taken within two hours. Never re-warm feeds. How much formula milk to give your baby If you are bottle-feeding, let your baby decide how much they want. Do not try to make your baby finish a bottle if they do not want to. Never re-use leftover milk once your baby finishes feeding. Throw it away. Get advice from your GP or public health nurse if your baby is sick and not feeding well. How much a baby usually drinks The following table is a guide only. Some babies might drink a little more, other babies might drink a little less. If you have concerns about the amount of formula your baby is taking, contact your public health nurse or GP . Your baby's age Average number of feeds in 24 hoursAverage daily fluid intake according to baby's weight Birth to 3 months 6 to 8 (feeding every 3 to 4 hours)150ml per kg (2\u00bd fluid ozs per lb) 4 to 6 months 4 to 6 (feeding every 4 to 6 hours)150ml per kg (2\u00bd fluid ozs per lb) See safefood.eu for more information. See pages 66 and 67 for advice on milk feeds and other drinks when your baby starts solid foods.!55 55 Feeding your babyFor breastfed and formula-fed babies Other drinks Breastfed babies get all the nourishment they need from your milk. They do not need any other drinks. If you are breastfeeding your baby, do not give them any other drinks unless advised to do so by your GP or public health nurse. Giving them other drinks could reduce the amount of breast milk that they get. Give your baby breast milk or formula milk as their main drink until they are at least 12 months old. Your baby generally does not need extra drinks. Cooled boiled water is the most suitable drink if your baby does need extra drinks between feeds. Advice on drinks for your baby Don't give your baby: juice - this includes diluted pure unsweetened fruit juices cow's milk - it is not suitable for babies under 12 months tea - it reduces their iron uptake Don't add any of the following to your baby's bottle: sugar, rusks or baby rice any medicines unless advised by your GP or paediatrician. Do: Introduce a cup or free flow beaker for drinks of cooled boiled water from about 6 months. Aim to replace all bottles (if you're using them) with a cup or beaker by the time your baby is about 1 year old.

But babies cannot safely get the vitamin D they need from the sun. You should give your baby 5 micrograms of vitamin D3 as a supplement every day from birth to 12 months if they are: breastfed taking less than 300mls or 10 fluid oz (ounces) of infant formula a day Due to a change in EU law (February 2020), there is an increase in the amount of vitamin D3 added to infant formula. All babies who are being breastfed should continue to get a vitamin D3 supplement after birth, even if you took vitamin D3 during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. You do not need to give your baby a vitamin D3 supplement if they are fed more than 300mls or 10 fluid oz (ounces) of infant formula a day. There are many suitable infant vitamin D3 supplements available to buy in Ireland. Use a supplement that contains vitamin D only and always check with your pharmacist. All children aged 1 to 4 years need to take a vitamin D supplement during winter. See page 69. Buying vitamin D3 supplements You can buy vitamin D3 supplements for babies in pharmacies and some supermarkets. Talk to your pharmacist and read the information on the label carefully. All supplements and medicines should be keep out of children's sight and reach at all times. !Vitamin D Vitamin D helps us to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. It also helps the immune system. Low-levels of vitamin D in children can cause rickets. This is a condition that leads to soft bones. 57 57 Feeding your babyBaby wind Wind is air that your baby has swallowed while feeding, crying or yawning. Babies need help to relieve trapped wind. Signs of trapped wind Common signs of trapped wind include squirming or crying during a feed, or looking uncomfortable and in pain if laid down after feeds How to wind your baby To wind your baby, hold them upright and gently pat or rub their back. You can hold them up against your shoulder. Skin-to-skin contact may relax your baby and they may wind more easily. Walk with your baby in your arms or in a baby sling. The upright position gently helps to relax them. Put a gentle little bump or bounce in your walk. Breastfeeding and wind Make sure your baby is positioned and attached well to the breast. Ask your public health nurse or lactation consultant to observe a breastfeed if you need help. Hand expressing a small amount of milk before feeding can help to slow down the flow of milk. Formula-feeding and wind Tilt the bottle so the teat and bottle neck are always full of milk. If your baby has a lot of trapped wind, try changing the teat on the bottle.

Reflux is different from vomiting, where your baby's muscles forcefully contract. Reflux is common and can affect up to 40% of babies.It usually occurs because a baby's food pipe (oesophagus) is still developing. It generally begins around 8 weeks old and improves as your baby gets older. As your baby gets older, the ring of muscle at the bottom of their oesophagus fully develops. This stops stomach contents leaking out. Signs and symptoms of reflux Your baby may not show any signs of reflux or they may show the following: spitting up milk during or after feeds refusing feeds, gagging or choking persistent hiccups or coughing excessive crying or crying while feeding You do not need to be worried about reflux if your baby is feeding well, happy and gaining weight as normal. When to get medical advice Contact your public health nurse or GP if reflux starts after 6 months of age or continues beyond 1 year. You should also get their advice if your baby: spits up feeds frequently or refuses feeds coughs or gags while feeding frequently projectile vomits cries a lot or is very irritable has green or yellow vomit, or vomits blood has blood in their poo or persistent diarrhoea has a swollen or tender tummy has a high temperature (fever) of 38\u00b0C or above is not gaining much weight, or is losing weight arches their back during or after a feed, or draws their legs up to their tummy after feeding59 59 Feeding your babyHow to help your baby with reflux Wind your baby during feeds (see page 57). Hold them upright for a period of time after the feed. Breastfeeding and reflux Have your feeding technique, positioning and attachment checked by your public health nurse. Your lactation consultant and the HSE's online Ask our Breastfeeding Expert services can also give you support and advice. See mychild.ie Formula feeding and reflux Talk to your public health nurse to make sure that your baby is taking the correct amount of formula for their age. To help their symptoms, try: offering smaller but more frequent feeds instead of a large volume in one go feeding in a more upright position Weaning your baby to solids Weaning your baby to solids means starting to feed your baby solid food, instead of just milk. Introducing your baby to weaning and spoon feeds is an exciting milestone. It's an opportunity for you and your family to share and enjoy food together. Your baby will be exploring new tastes and textures and they will learn from you. Progress may seem slow. With time and persistence, your baby will develop this important life skill. When to start Babies develop at different stages. Begin introducing solids when your baby is ready. This should be around 6 months. This is the same for both breastfed and formula-fed babies. You should not give your baby solid foods before 17 weeks (4 months) because: their kidneys are not mature enough to handle food and drinks other than milk their digestive systems are not yet developed enough to cope with solid foods breast milk or formula milk is all your baby needs until they are 6 months old introducing other foods or fluids can displace the essential nutrients supplied by breast or formula milk introducing solids too early can increase the risk of your child having obesity later in life it can increase their risk of allergy You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie60 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby60Don't wait later than 26 weeks (6 months). This is because: your baby's energy needs can no longer be met by either breast milk or formula milk alone iron stores from birth are used up by 6 months and their iron needs can no longer be met by milk alone it delays their opportunity to learn important skills, including self-feeding introducing different textures stimulates the development of muscles involved in speech Signs your baby is ready Signs that your baby is ready for solid food include: Able to sit up with support and can control their head movements. Not fully satisfied after a milk feed. Demands feeds more frequently for over a week. Shows an interest in food or reaches out for food. Watches others with interest when they are eating. Chews and dribbles more frequently (this could also be a sign of teething). Stages of weaningThe weaning process takes place in three stages. It starts with the first spoon feeds at 4 to 6 months. By 12 months, your baby should be enjoying family meals. Did you know? Homemade food is often cheaper, more nutritious and tastier than jars of baby food bought in shops. You can cook a batch and freeze in small batches. Liquids used to prepare solid food You can use: breast milk or formula milk water or stock from cooked vegetables cooled boiled water pasteurised full fat cow's milk (small amounts)Because they contain a lot of salt, do not use: gravy stock cubes jars or packets of sauce61 61 Feeding your babyHoney should not be given to babies under 12 months even if it has been cooked. It can contain spores of bacteria that could make your child very ill. Stage of weaning What texture the food should beWhat your baby will learn Stage 1 From about 6 months of ageStart with thin pur\u00e9es. They should have a soft and runny consistency. You should increase the thickness as your baby gets used to solid food. See stage 1 weaning foods on page 62. Taking foods from a spoon Moving food from the front to the back of the mouth for swallowing Managing increasingly thicker pur\u00e9es Stage 2 Between 6 to 9 months of ageMove to thicker pur\u00e9e and add less liquid to pur\u00e9e. Mash foods with a little liquid.Move to mashed foods with soft lumps. Your baby should also start drinking from a cup or beaker. See stage 2 weaning foods on page 63. Moving from thick pur\u00e9es to mashed foods, to foods with soft lumps Chewing lumps Beginning to feed themselves with bite-sized soft finger foods using hands and fingers Drinking from a beaker or cup Stage 3 Between 9 to 12 months of ageMove to lumpy and chopped family foods. By 12 months, your baby should be eating chopped foods. Offer harder finger foods (more textured). By 12 months, use a non- lidded beaker for all drinks other than breastfeeds. See stage 3 weaning foods on page 64. Lumpier textures will help with speech, chewing and increase the variety of your baby's diet in later childhood Self-feeding bite-sized pieces of food using hands and fingers Drinking from a cup Learning to eat with a spoon!

Start with 1 teaspoon of food made into a smooth, thin pur\u00e9e 2. Build up to 6 teaspoons at one time 3. Next, introduce solid food at another mealtime 4. Progress to 2 to 3 meals per day, with 5 to 10 teaspoons at each meal 5. Introduce one new food at a time, every 2 to 3 days Giving your baby food Always wash your hands and your baby's hands before you prepare food and feed them. Organise meal times so that your baby eats with the rest of the family when possible.Choose a time when you are not rushed and under pressure. Turn off distractions such as the television, computer, tablet and your phone - enjoy this special time with your baby Safety at meal times Sitting in a highchair is the safest place for a child to sit. It also helps build good eating habits. Make sure they are strapped in safely. Children can choke on food if they are walking or running around while eating. Never leave your child alone while they are eating in case they choke. Always remove bibs after feeding your child. This is to prevent suffocation and strangulation. Choosing a high chair Choose a high chair with foot support so that your baby feels stable and can concentrate on learning to eat. They A five-point safety harness63 63 Feeding your babyshould be well-supported and comfortable, and not slide around the chair. Look for a five- point safety harness to prevent falls. Baby-led weaning Some parents prefer to use a baby-led approach to weaning. See mychild.ie How long stage 1 lasts Babies who start spoon feeds at 6 months will usually move through stage 1 quicker than those who start solids earlier. Start with thin pur\u00e9es initially which should increase in thickness as your baby gets used to solid foods. Stage 2 Ideas for Stage 2 foods Include the same food as in stage 1, but now include: well-cooked eggs porridge and wholegrain breakfast cereals which are low in sugar and salt bread, rice and pasta cheese (pasteurised) yoghurt meat, poultry, fish, peas, beans and lentils Pasteurised cow's milk can be used in small amounts to moisten foods. Finger foods Finger foods are an important step in learning to chew. You should offer and encourage your baby with suitable finger foods from 7 months old. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie64 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby64Here are some finger food ideas that can be easily handled and enjoyed by your baby: Cooked vegetables such as carrot, parsnip, sweet potato, broccoli. Peeled fruit such as pear, banana, peaches, melon, avocado. Fingers of buttered toast. Bread sticks. Plain rice or corn cakes. Cheese cut into strips. Cooked pasta shapes such as fusilli or penne. Sliced or shredded meats. Fingers of french toast. Slices of omelette. Homemade pancakes. Potato bread or soda bread. Dry cereals. Corn snack and vegetable puff-type finger foods for babies melt in your baby's mouth so they do not have to chew. You should offer more of the foods above rather than relying on these. Result to aim for Be led by your baby, and feed to their appetite. Use these portion sizes as a guide. 3 meals a day, each about 2 to 4 tablespoons of food. 2 to 3 snacks in between main meals. Finger foods. Foods should be offered before milk feed. Some drinks taken from a cup or beaker. Stage 3 Ideas for Stage 3 foodsContinue using the same food as stages 1 and 2 and continue to increase the variety in your baby's diet. Most family foods are now suitable without added gravies, sauces, salt or sugar. Snack foods during stage 3 of weaning A boiled egg and wholemeal toast soldiers. Chopped fruits such as apple or banana. A rice cake. Vegetable sticks such as soft cooked carrot. Yoghurt. Small wholemeal scone with butter. Beans on toast. Home-made soup. Choose wholegrain bread, brown pasta and rice. These provide more fibre for your baby. For fussy babies or children mix brown and white pasta or rice to begin with.65 65 Feeding your babyResult to aim for Be led by your baby, and feed to their appetite. Use these portion sizes as a guide. 3 meals of about 4 to 6 tablespoons. 2 to 3 snacks. Able to manage more than 2 textures in one meal. All drinks (other than breastfeeds) taken from a cup or beaker by 12 months. Do not give your baby raw shellfish as this can cause food poisoning swordfish, shark, marlin or tuna if your child is under 12 months - these fish contain high levels of mercury honey unpasteurised cheese, milk or yoghurt undercooked eggs sugar salt, gravies, packets or jars of sauces, packets of soup or meal makers or stock-cubes tea or coffee liver processed or cured meats such as sausages, ham or bacon Common concerns Gagging Gagging is a normal reflex babies have. It happens when your baby is learning how to move lumps of food around their mouth. It is a normal part of learning to eat and swallow. Gagging is not choking, but it can be scary for parents when it happens. You might feel like you should stop offering lumpier textures to your baby. But your baby will gag less over time if you challenge them with new and different textures. Gagging is a sign that your baby can protect their airway and is learning to clear food from the back of their mouth. It will happen less when your baby is offered different textures and learns what they need to do to deal with them. The phase when your baby is gagging regularly will last longer if you keep giving them smooth and lump-free pur\u00e9e. Make sure you move them onto the next stage and through the rest of the stages as recommended. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie66 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby66Foods your child could choke on Always cut food to a size that your child can chew and eat safely. Grapes, cherry tomatoes and similar-shaped food should be cut into quarters (or smaller) lengthways. Do not give popcorn, whole nuts, marshmallows or hard sweets to your toddler. These foods should never be given to children under 5 years of age. Milk feeds and introducing solid foods Introducing solid foods to your baby will gradually reduce the amount of milk feeds they need. If your baby is breastfed There is no need to move from breast milk to formula milk when introducing solid food. You can continue to breastfeed your baby while they are starting solid foods, until they are up to 2 years of age and beyond. If you have made the decision to stop breastfeeding, see page 48. If your baby is formula-fed If you are not breastfeeding, you need to give to your baby a first infant formula (number 1) until they are 12 months old. Once your baby starts on solid foods, the amount of formula that they drink will reduce gradually. Stage 2 of solid food (6 to 9 months): 3 to 4 feeds about 600mls (21oz) per dayStage 3 of solid food 9 to 12 months: about 400mls (14oz) per dayFollow-on milks or 'number 2' milks are not necessary or recommended. Drinks for your baby Drinks for babies under 6 months From birth, breast milk or formula milk meets your baby's needs for food and drink to help them grow and develop. They do not need other drinks.67 67 Feeding your babyDrinks for babies over 6 months From 6 months on, offer your baby cooled boiled water in a free-flow beaker at meal or snack times. Boil and cool water before giving it to your baby. You need to keep doing this until they are 12 months old. Both tap and bottled water need to be boiled and then cooled. You can use small amounts of pasteurised full fat cow's milk to mix in with weaning foods from 6 months onwards. It is not suitable as a drink until your baby is 12 months old. Drinks for babies over 12 months You can offer full-fat cow's milk instead of formula as the main milk drink after 12 months. Drinks that are not suitable for babies Tea or coffee Tea and coffee make it difficult for your baby to absorb iron. They also contain caffeine which could affect their sleep. Fizzy drinks They have a lot of sugar or acid, which is harmful to teeth. Fizzy drinks also fill up your baby's tummy and they might not want to eat their meals. Fruit juices Fruit juices are not recommended. They contain sugar, so can damage your child's teeth. If you choose to offer juices, give only small amounts of well-diluted, unsweetened fruit juice. To do this, dilute 1 measure of pure fruit juice to 8 to 10 measures of cooled boiled water. Use a cup or beaker. Only give this at mealtimes or with snacks. When to start using a beaker or a cup Your baby can start drinking from a beaker from 6 months on. You can use it for cooled boiled water, expressed breast milk or formula milk. Use a lidded beaker that is non-valved with a free-flowing spout. Drinking from a cup or beaker helps your baby to develop their swallow further. By 12 months of age, your baby should be using a non-lidded beaker for all drinks other than breastfeeds.

This helps their growth and development. Children's food pyramid Children aged 1 to 4 years old have small tummies but they have high nutritional needs. They can only eat small amounts. Offer them three meals and two to three snacks every day. All their food needs to be nourishing. The children's food pyramid sets out how many daily servings your child should have from each food shelf. Children aged 1 to 2 years need: cereals and breads, potatoes, pasta and rice for energy - 3 to 4 servings a day vegetables, salad and fruit for vitamins and minerals - 2 to 3 servings a day milk, yogurt and cheese for calcium and healthy bones and teeth - 3 servings a day meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts for protein - 2 servings a day You can find the children's food pyramid on www.mychild.ie/nutritionChildren aged 1 to 4 should have limited fats, spreads and oils. Too much can be bad for their health. Examples of a small amount: 1 teaspoon of spread on bread half teaspoon oil in cooking Try grilling, baking and steaming instead of frying or roasting with oil or fat.Your child's daily diet shouldn't have food and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt. They are linked to being overweight in childhood. These include: sweets chocolate biscuits cakes fizzy drinks crisps iron vitamin D vitamin C omega 3 fatsNutrients It's important for the growth and development of babies and children that their diet includes key nutrients like: Vitamin D is important for healthy bones. Your child can get it from: oily fish - herring, mackerel, salmon, trout, sardines eggs 'fortified' cereals and milks that have added vitamin D 69 69 Feeding your babyVitamin D supplements Some babies under 12 months need a vitamin D supplement each day. See page 56. All children aged 1 to 4 years need to take a vitamin D supplement during winter. Give them 5 micrograms of a vitamin D3-only supplement from Halloween (October 31st) to St Patrick's Day (March 17th). Liquid drops are usually best for this age group. Iron Iron is important in your child's diet. It helps them grow. Iron also helps make new red blood cells that carry oxygen from your child's lungs to their body. Babies are born with stores of iron that last about six months. From 6 months, your growing child needs to get iron from the foods that they eat. The best sources of iron Meats such as beef, lamb, pork and poultry contain iron. Red meat is the best source of iron. You should give it to your child three or four times a week. Liver is not recommended as it contains too much vitamin A for babies. Other good sources of iron include eggs (well-cooked), lentils, green leafy vegetables such as spinach or broccoli and fortified breakfast cereals (make sure they are low in salt and sugar). Check the cereal box label for ones that contain at least 12mg of iron per 100g. Vitamin C can help your child's body to absorb non-meat sources of iron. They can get it from some: fresh fruits - oranges, mandarins, berries or kiwi fruit fresh vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower and peppers For example, add some chopped berries to a breakfast porridge or cereal that contains iron. Anaemia Your child may develop a condition called anaemia if they do not get enough iron in their diet. Anaemia happens when you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen around the body. If your child has anaemia, they might seem: tired and pale with a poor appetite less able to fight infection Contact your public health nurse or GP if you are concerned that your child may have anaemia.!

You can get omega 3 from oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, trout and sardines. It is recommended to include two 1oz portions of oily fish a week from 7 months of age. Offer your child (aged 1 to 4 years) oily fish once a week. Milk and nut milks From 12 months, your child should not drink more than 600mls of full fat cow's milk per day. This includes the milk used on their breakfast cereal. Your child should drink milk from a cup or beaker, unless you are breastfeeding. From 12 months, infant formula, follow-on milk or toddler milks are not necessary or recommended. Do not give your child under 2 years: low-fat milk dairy alternatives such as almond milk, coconut milk, oat milk. Rice milk is not suitable for children under 4 and a half years old. tea or coffee fruit juice drinks fizzy drinks dilutable squashes Gluten There is no need to avoid gluten when introducing foods into your baby's diet. You can introduce foods containing gluten any time between 4 months (17 weeks) and 12 months of age. Give small amounts at first and make sure it is the right consistency (thickness and texture) for their age. See page 59 for information on weaning to solid foods. Foods containing gluten include bread, pasta, crackers and breakfast cereals. Food allergies Recent research shows that you can prevent your child from becoming allergic to certain foods like eggs, milk and peanut if you introduce these foods into your child's diet early (around 6 months). Foods that can commonly cause allergies include nuts, milk, eggs and fish. You should introduce these foods one at a time. This is because if your baby does have a reaction to a food, you will know what food caused the reaction. Peanuts If your baby is 6 months old, do not delay the introduction of peanut into their diet. Use smooth peanut butter or spread that is sugar-free and salt-free. Talk to your GP or public health nurse first if your baby has bad eczema. 71 71 Feeding your babyDon't give whole nuts like peanuts to your child until they over the age of 5, as they could cause them to choke. Other nuts It is safe to give other nuts like cashews and hazelnuts to your baby in smooth butters or spreads. These must be sugar-free and salt-free. Dairy Introduce pasteurised dairy products like cheese (for example cheddar) and yoghurt (natural yoghurt with some fruit puree or chopped fruit) from 6 months. Cow's milk can be used to prepare solids foods but should not be given to your child as a drink until they are 12 months old. See page 70. Eggs You should give well-cooked eggs from 6 months in the right texture and consistency for their stage. Fish Fish can be given to your baby when you are introducing solid foods (see page 59). Oily fish (for example salmon, mackerel, sardines and trout) contains omega 3 fats which are essential for brain and eye development. See page 70 for recommended amounts. Meal planning Take time to plan your meals in advance. This will help you to introduce variety, eat more nutritious foods, save money and rely less on convenience and processed foods. Cook just one main meal for the whole family. Try to make this meal healthy and balanced including foods from the food pyramid shelves (see page 68). Fussy or picky eating Fussy, faddy and picky eating is a phase when your child doesn't eat well or refuses to eat certain foods. It is a normal part of their development and can happen around 18 months old. Children's appetites differ greatly. What to do Don't be upset if they refuse to eat well the odd day. This is a part of growing up but it can be worrying for parents. If fussy eating continues, ask your public health nurse, GP or GP practice nurse for advice. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie72 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieFeeding your baby72Causes of fussy eating Your child may be: unwell now or recovering from a recent illness eating too many snacks between meals drinking too much milk or other drinks showing their independence Tips to help fussy eating habits Your child's relationship with food will develop by watching and learning from what is going on around them. Sit down as a family to enjoy mealtimes. To help your child to eat well: have a daily routine with regular mealtimes where you sit down at a table with your child to eat eat lots of different foods in front of your child - they will be more likely to do the same involve them in the meals - for example, when you are planning, shopping, preparing, cooking and tidying-up offer a wide variety of foods and include their favourite healthy foods regularly give small portions on a plate let them eat their food first before you give them their drink give them enough time to eat allow them to stop eating when they say that they are full - wait until the next snack or meal time before offering more food be firm but do not force them to eat limit distractions - turn off the television, computer, tablet and put your phone away try not to rely on food to reward your child for good behaviour or as a comfort if your child is upset. Think of alternatives like stickers or a trip to the playground make positive comments about food - avoid placing too much focus on certain foods, like vegetables Finish the meal after about 30 minutes and accept that is all your child is going to eat. Take away uneaten food without comment. Ignore the fussy behaviour, lots of attention may make them keep it up. Calm and consistent Remain calm and continue to approach your child's refusal to eat in a positive way. If your child is active and gaining weight, they are getting enough to eat. Did you know? It can take up to 10 to 15 tries before your child will accept a new food.73 73 Sleeping Sleep for newborns Newborn babies are too young to follow strict routines. Some babies sleep for long periods, others for a short period. See page 75 for information on how much sleep newborn babies need. You can begin a bedtime routine when your baby is between 3 and 6 months (see page 76). The first few weeks Your baby's sleep pattern is probably not going to fit in with your sleep pattern. Try to sleep when your baby sleeps. The first few weeks can be a difficult. It can be frustrating. It will take time to adjust. Sleeping position To reduce the risk of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome): Always put your baby down to sleep (day and night) on their back. Their feet should be at the foot of the cot, crib or Moses basket. Keep their head and face uncovered. Make sure everyone who looks after your baby puts them to sleep on their back.Sleeping Sleep is one of the most challenging parts of caring for your child. Your child is going to learn how to settle themselves to sleep and will develop a routine in time. This will take time, but you will get there. ! You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie74 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieSleeping74Moving their head If your baby always lies with their head in the same position, they might develop a 'flat head'. This is known as plagiocephaly. You can prevent this when putting your baby down to sleep. Turn their head so that sometimes they face left and sometimes they face right. This will also help your baby's head and neck muscles to develop strength equally on both sides. Their own room From 6 months you can move your baby into their own room to sleep, if you have the space. Most young children stay in a cot until they are between 2 and 3 years old. Change to a low bed to prevent injuries if your child: learns to climb out of the cot, or grows too big for the cot Finding their position At around 6 months your baby will move about during sleep and change their position in the cot. They will find their own sleep position. Continue to put them down to sleep on their back to reduce the risk of cot death. Check on them while they are asleep to see if they have kicked the blankets over their head or off their body. Where to put the cot, crib or Moses basket Your baby should sleep in their own cot, Moses basket or crib in the same room as you for at least the first six months. Do not place the cot, Moses basket or crib near a radiator or heater as it may be too hot. Place the cot, Moses basket or crib away from open windows to avoid draughts. Make it a safe place to sleep Do not use cot bumpers (padding around the sides of the cot) as these can increase the risk of suffocation. Keep the cot, Moses basket or crib clear of items including pillows, cushions and toys. Do not hang ribbons or toys with strings from your baby's cot, Moses basket or crib - your baby could choke on them or be strangled. See page 202 for more information on how to reduce the risk of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome).75 75 SleepingLight and noise The bedroom should be dark. You can keep a night light switched on for older babies and toddlers. See page 78. Use blackout blinds if needed. See page 194 for advice on blind cords. The room should be as quiet as possible, though you should not worry about a normal level of background noise. Avoid music, mobiles or light-up and electronic toys in or near the cot. These are props. A prop is a physical item your child relies on to go to sleep. They might also disrupt sleep during the night. If you have a mobile above the cot, phase it out when your baby is five months old. How much sleep your child needs Your child's age Their sleep From birth to 3 monthsYour baby needs about 9 to 18 hours of sleep over a day (an average of 14 and a half hours) - some babies sleep more than others. They may go straight to sleep after a feed. When possible, put your baby to bed drowsy but awake, so that they wake up where they fall asleep. This might help them to go back to sleep if they wake up during the night. Background noises such as music or children playing may not wake them but a sudden loud noise might. Limit your caffeine intake if you are breastfeeding (see page 37). This is because caffeine is a stimulant and may keep your baby awake. 3 to 6 months Your baby needs about 12 to 14 hours sleep over a day. They will usually nap for around 3 to 4 hours. They may still go straight to sleep after a feed and then wake for a while before the next feed is due. By about 6 months, your baby will stay awake and be more alert between feeds. At this stage, they are starting to identify the difference between day and night. A bedtime routine (see page 76) at this age helps to show your baby that sleep time is approaching. It is normal for your baby to wake briefly during the night (see page 79). You should avoid stimulating your baby if this happens, for example by talking loudly or playing with them. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie76 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieSleeping76Your child's age Their sleep By about 6 monthsYour baby needs about 10 to 11 hours of sleep a night. Two to three naps during the day, each for about an hour and a half or 2 hours, is enough. They will be less likely to sleep during a feed. By about 1 year Your toddler needs about 10 to 12 hours of sleep a night. They won't have a nutritional need for night feeds if they are fully established on solid foods (see page 61). Your child might want to feed for comfort or to help them fall back asleep. Some parents may choose to continue feeding at night. For others, it can disturb their sleep. See page 80 for advice on phasing out night feeds. They may have 2 naps during the daytime of about one and a half to two hours each. Your toddler should be awake by 3.30pm after their nap. If they sleep later than this, it can interrupt their night-time sleep. By about 18 monthsYour toddler needs about 11 to 12 hours of sleep a night. They may have one nap during the daytime of about one and a half to two hours. By about 2 yearsYour toddler needs about 11 to 12 hours of sleep a night. They may have one nap during the day of about one a half hours or two and a quarter hours. Try not to let your child nap beyond the mid-afternoon. This will help them to be tired and ready for sleep again by night time. Bedtime routine Getting your baby to sleep A bedtime routine is important. You can start this between 3 to 6 months. Build a routine around the last feed before you settle your baby down to sleep. Have about half an hour between the last feed and your baby settling to sleep. This is to avoid your baby linking feeding to going to sleep. 77 77 SleepingYou can build a routine by: making a clear difference between day and night - for example, use dim lights and a low voice in the evening along with relaxing activities like a bath encouraging your child to be out in the daylight early in the day and to be active in the evenings. This helps your child to make the hormone melatonin that helps them to go sleep having 'wind down' time in the hour before bed putting your baby to sleep in the same place when at home feeding your baby after a bath or after you change them into sleeping clothes avoiding rocking to sleep - they may need to be rocked to get back to sleep if they wake during the night During the night Use a dim light when you feed your baby at night as a bright one may over-stimulate them - yellow or red light is best and avoid blue light. Speak to your baby in a quiet calm voice when you are feeding them at night - talking loudly may encourage them to stay awake. Put your baby back into the cot drowsy but awake so that they wake up where they fall asleep. Don't change your baby's nappy during sleep time unless it is dirty. Getting your toddler to sleep Your toddler will thrive when there is a regular bedtime routine. Your toddler should go to sleep and get up around the same time each day. Make going to bed as predictable as possible. Whenever you can, share bedtimes and storytelling between parents. Create an atmosphere that will help your toddler to sleep: You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie78 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieSleeping78Before they go to bed Avoid exciting activities such as playing outside and running around just before bedtime. Do not give them a very large meal or sugary snacks or drinks just before bedtime. Give them a supper of carbohydrates like bread, rice or cereals and some milk, which helps to produce the sleepy hormone melatonin. Turn off all screens and the television an hour before bed. Bed time Brush their teeth and make sure they have a clean nappy when they go to bed. You can switch on a night light in the room so that they do not feel upset if they wake up in the dark. The light should be out of their sight. Yellow and red night lights are best. This will give you some light to check on your child during the night. Keep the night light on throughout the night. Your child might get upset if they wake up in the night and it's switched off. Put them to bed drowsy but awake, so they wake up where they went to sleep.Read a short bedtime story to help them relax before sleep. When you leave the room Leave the bedroom door open so that they can hear some soothing and familiar noises outside. Comfort toys Some children like to bring a favourite toy or blanket with them as they settle down to sleep. Make sure it is clean and not a danger to them while they are sleeping. Comfort toys like blankets or teddies allow your child to self-soothe. They are unlikely to disturb their sleep. Avoid toys with music or lights. This includes mobiles above their cot or bed. If you have a mobile above the cot, phase it out when your baby is five months. It can become something they rely on to fall asleep. It can also stimulate your baby to be more awake. If you are worried Every baby and toddler has different sleep patterns. Contact your public health nurse, GP or GP practice nurse for information and advice if you are worried that: your baby is not sleeping, or their sleep pattern is disturbed you are finding it difficult to cope79 79 SleepingWaking during the night Waking up during the night is sometimes called 'night wakening'. It mostly happens to babies and toddlers. Research shows disturbed sleep at night is one of the most common problems parents have. In Ireland, 30% of mothers with 9-month-old babies said sleep patterns were a problem. 22% of mothers of children aged 3 years continued to identify sleep as a problem. How children fall asleep at night Small children usually fall into a deep sleep within 5 minutes of going to sleep. The first two sleep cycles last about three to four hours and are mostly deep sleep. As your child moves to lighter sleep, they stir and move around. They may open their eyes.If everything is the same as when they first went to sleep, they will fall asleep again quickly.But if something is missing, then your child may cry for you. They will want to recreate the same situation they had when they fell asleep. For example, you might have rocked them to sleep at bedtime. They will want you to do this again each time they wake up during the night. For some parents, it isn't a problem to repeat this. For others, the disruption to their sleep can be very difficult. There are ways you can help your child to learn how to fall asleep again without you being there. Learning to fall asleep Your child falling asleep by themselves is a learned behaviour. There are ways you can support this from 6 months of age. Try to: place your child to sleep in their own cot avoid 'props' in or near the cot - these include musical or light-up toys and ceiling- hung mobiles avoid sleep associations - this may be physical contact with a parent as a child is falling to sleep. For example, rubbing their back, rocking or feeding to sleep. Sleep associations usually develop between 6 and 12 months When possible, put your baby to bed drowsy but awake, so that they wake up where they fall asleep. Follow the bedtime routine tips on page 77 to 78. There is advice on how to help your child to sleep through the night on page 80. Helping your toddler to be comfortable falling asleep by themselves is a great skill. Good sleep patterns in childhood can be good for your health as an adult. Feeding during the night Young babies will need to feed during the night. They may fall asleep during the feed. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie80 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieSleeping80Introducing solid foods begins around 6 months (see page 59). Once your baby is fully established on to solid foods, they will get all the food they need during the day. You can then phase out night feeds. Some parents may choose to continue to breastfeed during the night for other reasons, such as comfort. How to gradually reduce and stop night feeds: decrease the frequency and volume of feeds for bottle-fed babies space out the timing of breastfeeding for breastfed babies If possible, try to avoid your baby falling asleep while feeding. This can lead to them associating or linking sleep with feeding. They may need a feed to go back to sleep if they wake during the night. Talk to a public health nurse if you have questions about sleep and feeding. If you are breastfeeding, you can also get advice from the 'Ask our breastfeeding expert' service on mychild.ie. Helping your child sleep through the night Babies start to sleep for longer periods at night from about 3 months on. You may want to establish a bedtime routine which is done in the same way at roughly the same time each night. This is to help them sleep through the night and begin to know the difference between day and night. A change in routine will take a little time. Gradual retreat Some parents feel that not being present when a young child falls asleep is too difficult for them and their child. You can try the 'gradual retreat' technique. It gently teaches your child to fall asleep on their own while you are in the room. 1. Put your child into the cot or bed while they are awake and sit on a chair next to them. 2. Stay there until your child falls asleep. 3. Once your child can consistently fall asleep this way, sit farther and farther away every 3 to 4 nights - eventually you will be out of sight in the hallway. Some parents find it easier to pretend that they are asleep rather than sitting in a chair. Be consistent It is important to be consistent in applying your new routine and not to give up. The first few nights are likely to be very challenging. Often the second or third night is worse than the first night. But within a few nights to a week, you will begin to see improvement. Make sure to use the bedtime routine tips outlined on page 76 too. If your toddler wakes up crying every night Crying is a form of communication and your toddler is telling you something. They may simply be tired. Make sure they are not hungry by giving them supper as part of their bedtime routine. Change their nappy before they go to bed. Brief awakenings are normal during the night. 81 81 SleepingWait a minute or two before checking on your toddler if they wake or cry, as they may fall back to sleep. If they do not go back to sleep: 1. Settle and soothe them - comfort them and talk softly. 2. Put your child back to sleep in their own cot or bed. 3. When you have resettled your child, don't stay in the room. 4. If they wake and cry again, repeat the steps above. Teething, illness and a dirty nappy can also cause your child to wake up. Follow the steps above after dealing with the situation. For example, after giving your child liquid paracetamol or changing their nappy. Toddlers do not normally need to be fed during the night if they are eating a normal family diet (see page 80). Some parents may choose to breastfeed at night for comfort. Try not to play with them or let them get into your bed. In this way, you are helping them learn that night time is for sleeping. The aim is to let your toddler know that you are there but support them to self-soothe to sleep. Reward your child with praise for their efforts the next day. Be specific, for example, \"you are such a good boy for staying in your bed.\" This way of changing your toddler's sleep pattern is gradual. It may take a week or two to work. Contact your public health nurse or GP for advice if: these techniques do not work for you lack of sleep is getting you down Daytime naps Naps are essential during the day to prevent your child from becoming overtired. If a child is overtired, it can affect their night time sleep. Some parents say that their children 'never nap'. Usually their child is having short naps in the car or in the buggy. Generally, a child does not need to nap for more than two hours. Napping habits can differ between children. Common difficulties with napping Hidden naps may happen in the car or when you are out walking with your child in a buggy. The timing of these naps can impact on their overall quality of sleep. Another difficulty can be too little napping during the day and too much sleep at night. If your child is content during the day, then this is not a problem. If they are cranky and out of sorts, then you may wish to wake them earlier in the morning.

The way you respond to your baby's crying is very important. If you respond calmly, this helps them to manage their distress and feel secure. It also helps to build your relationship. Give yourself time Accept offers of help and support from family and friends as this can be a difficult time for you. In the early stages it's not always obvious why your baby is crying or distressed. It takes time to learn to read your baby's signals. Why your baby might be crying Babies normally have at least one period of being unsettled each day. They cry for many reasons. Some reasons for crying include: hunger or thirst being overfull a wet or dirty nappy pain from wind (page 57), colic (page 84) or reflux (page 58) being too hot or too cold being overtired or overstimulated loneliness or boredom, or being unwell It can take time to learn what your baby is trying to communicate. Try to be patient with yourself as you get to know your baby.Before they learn to speak, crying is your baby's way of telling you that they need something. 83 83 CryingDealing with crying It might be very difficult to remain calm while your baby is crying. Staying calm and using a soothing voice will help your baby to become calm. Your baby will learn early on that you are able to manage their feelings. This in turn will help them to manage theirs. You can also soothe your baby by: holding them close and moving gently feeding nappy changing rocking your baby gently singing to your baby gently or listening to music together gently talking to your baby \u2014 babies enjoy the soothing sound of their parents' voices, especially when the voice is close and softly spoken massaging your baby gently with unscented oil placing them safely in a sling (see page 88) going for a short walk or drive in the car with your baby leaving their nappy off and letting them kick their legs giving them a bath (see page 88) Contact your GP if: the crying continues the crying sounds unusual, or you are worried that your baby is ill Self-soothing As your baby gets older, they may be able to calm and soothe themselves. They do this by: bringing their hand to their mouth to suck it touching and stroking their hands and feet making eye contact and touching you You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie84 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieCrying84If you are finding it difficult If you are finding it hard to stay calm or to cope with your baby's crying, then: Put your baby down in their cot and go into another room for a moment to calm down. Ask someone to come and help you care for your baby while you take a break. Contact a relative, friend, your GP or your public health nurse for advice and help. Call Parentline for support and advice on 1890 927 277. Many parents find caring for a baby exhausting, especially if the baby is hard to console. Try and remember this stage will pass. Get support from family, friends and professionals to help you through this time. Never shake your baby, as this can damage your baby's brain and put them in serious danger. Colic Colic is the name for excessive and frequent crying in a baby who is otherwise healthy. Colic is very common and affects 1 in 5 babies. Colic can be very upsetting for parents. It is hard to see your baby crying so intensely, and it can seem like your baby is in pain. When colic starts Colic usually starts when babies are about 2 weeks old. It usually ends by the time they are 4 months old but sometimes it lasts until they are 6 months old. It is more common in the evening time. Sometimes a baby with colic can cry for many hours during the day or night.!85 85 CryingSigns of colic A baby has colic if they cry: for more than 3 hours a day for more than 3 days a week, and for more than 3 weeks Babies with colic often have the following symptoms: periods of crying where they are harder to console than usual restlessness drawing their legs up, or arching their backs, or clenching their fists going red in the face seeming to settle and then having another spell of crying Babies with colic are fine between periods of crying. Your baby should be feeding well and gaining weight even if they have colic. Causes of colic It is not known why some babies get colic. Colic is more common in premature babies. It can be more common if the baby is in a home where somebody smokes. For a minority of babies, the cause of their colic is intolerance to cow's milk. How to help your baby with colic There is no treatment for colic. Different things will help different babies. As you get to know your baby, you will learn what works for you. Continue breastfeeding on demand or offering your baby formula feeds.Things that might help: Hold your baby close during a crying episode - you are not 'spoiling' your baby by responding to their needs in this way. Sit your baby upright during feeds. Wind or burp your baby after feeds. Gently rock your baby. A warm bath. Gently massaging your baby's tummy. There are some other things you may like to try. There is no scientific research to support their use, but some parents find them helpful. Movement and motion, for example a walk in the buggy or pram, or a car journey. Music. 'White noise' like the low frequency noise of a vacuum cleaner, a radio not tuned in properly or 'white noise' music or apps.

Some parents find drops that can be added to the baby's breast milk or bottle milk are helpful. But there is no scientific evidence that they work. Formula Always talk to your public health nurse before changing your baby's formula milk. Complementary therapies Be careful about using complementary therapies like herbal remedies. These have not been proven to work and some have been shown to cause serious side effects. There is no evidence that cranial osteopathy or spinal manipulation work. This manipulates or moves your baby's muscles in a particular way. These could be harmful to your baby. When you should see your GP Bring your baby to the GP if: you are not sure if your baby has colic or why they are crying they are vomiting green stuff (bile) they have projectile vomiting they have bloody poo they are not feeding well their symptoms started after you introduced formula they are losing weight or not gaining weight they have a temperature greater than 38\u00b0C You can also go to the GP if you are concerned or you are finding it hard to cope. Looking after yourself Many babies get colic. This is not your fault. You are not spoiling your baby by responding and your baby is not rejecting you. It can be upsetting when it is difficult to comfort your baby. It can be also upsetting when someone else manages to soothe a baby that has been crying with you for hours. Remember: This will stop eventually - all babies with colic have improved by 4 to 6 months. You need to get rest and look after your own wellbeing - if possible ask family and friends for support.87 87 Caring for your child Caring for your child Getting confident about everyday care and tasks is an important step in your new role as a parent. With time and practice, this gets easier and quicker to do. Equipment A correctly-fitted rear-facing car seat is essential when going for drives with your baby. See page 205. Other useful equipment for moving about with your baby includes: a pram or a buggy that can lie back (recline) a baby sling Prams or pushchairs Pushchairs and strollers are only suitable for newborns if they recline fully. This means your baby can lie down. Check to see if: it is sturdy has brakes that work the folding mechanisms are securely locked into place complies with European safety standards has a five-point harness \u2014 that's a harness with five straps that are all properly secured to provide really effective restraint When you're out and about Do not use pillows or cushions as they could cause suffocation. Hold onto the buggy or pram securely to prevent it slipping from your grasp. Always put wheel brakes on when you stop, even on a flat surface. Do not hang bags on the handle of the pram or buggy as this may cause it to tip over. Place them in the basket underneath. Do not attach your dog's lead to your buggy - they could pull the buggy away. If your baby falls asleep in a seated position, always place them on their back as soon as possible.

Baby carriers and slings can be a suffocation risk unless you use them correctly. Make sure that your baby or toddler is upright, their head is supported and they do not get too hot. Always follow the TICKS guidance (see picture). If your baby falls asleep, remove them from the sling or carrier as soon as possible. Place them on their back on a flat surface. Do not drink or make hot drinks or cook while holding your baby in your arms or in a sling. Your baby could be scalded. Take care not to trip or fall when going up or down stairs or walking on uneven ground. Contact your GP or paediatrician before using a sling or babywearing coat if your baby: is younger than four months of age had a low birth weight was premature has a medical condition, including respiratory conditions and colds ! Bathing your baby Bath time is a chance for you and your baby to have fun, play and interact. A bath two or three times a week is enough to keep your baby clean. Preparing for the bath Have everything you need ready before you start: a baby bath or basin a clean nappy clean clothes two towels some cotton wool89 89 Caring for your childUse plain water and no liquid soaps for babies under 1 month. Other tips: Plan the bath for a quiet time of the day. Choose a time when your baby is not too hungry or tired. Do not bathe them just after a feed. Have everything you need within easy reach so you don't need to turn away from your baby while they are in the bath. Close windows to prevent a draught. Make sure the room is warm as babies can get cold quickly. Water temperature Your baby's skin needs cooler water than your own. Water that may feel barely warm to you could be painfully hot for your baby. Follow these steps to get the correct temperature: 1. Put the cold water in the bath or basin first. 2. Then put the warm water in. 3. If your bath has a single tap with a hot and cold feed, make sure you run the cold water again to cool the taps so they won't burn your baby. 4. The water level should be just high enough to cover your baby's tummy when they are lying down. 5. Mix the water well to ensure there are no 'hot spots'. 6. Always check the temperature of the bathwater with your elbow - your hands are not heat-sensitive enough. 7. If using a bath thermometer, make sure the temperature is around 36\u00b0C. How to bathe your baby 1. Hold your baby on your knee and clean their face. 2. Hold their head over the basin, bath, baby bath or sink and wash their hair. 3. Make sure you dry their head. 4. Slip off their nappy and wipe their bottom.

Get ready to lower your baby into the basin, bath, baby bath or sink. Have one of your arms behind their shoulders and neck, holding their outside arm with your hand. 6. Place your other hand under their bottom. 7. Lower your baby slowly into the water so they don't feel as though they are falling. 8. When their bottom is resting on the floor of the basin, bath, baby bath or sink, you can remove that hand to wash them. 9. Use your other hand to keep your baby's head out of the water. 10. When finished, put the hand you used to wash them back under their bottom. 11. Hold their legs with that arm as they will be slippery. Then lift them out onto the towel. 12. Pat them dry. Don't forget to dry their skin folds and creases. 13. Empty the basin, bath, baby bath or sink. Now is a good time to try baby massage, this can help soothe them. Don't use any oils on their skin for the first month. Bath safety Never leave your baby alone in the bath, not even for a second as they are at risk of scalds and drowning. Do not use bath seats - your baby could slip out or tip forwards or sideways into the water. Do not rely on a toddler or older child to mind your baby in the bath. Do not leave babies, toddlers or young children in the bathroom without adult supervision. 91 91 Caring for your childKeeping your baby clean between baths A 'top and tail' wash is a quick way to keep your baby clean between baths. Use pieces of cotton wool and a bowl of warm water. Wet each piece of cotton wool in the bowl and then squeeze it out so it is just damp when you use it. Use different pieces of cotton wool to clean: your baby's face and hands the folds or creases under the neck the folds and creases under arms the nappy area Your baby's fingernails Your baby's nails are very soft in the first few weeks after birth. You could easily cut their skin when you cut the nails. You may find it better to gently peel the nails off or use an emery board to file them.After a week or two, buy special baby nail clippers or small round-ended safety nail scissors from a pharmacy. Wait until your baby is relaxed or asleep before trying to cut nails. Ask someone else to help you if you need to. Taking care of your baby's umbilical cord The umbilical cord stump should fall off between 5 to 15 days after birth. Before the umbilical cord stump falls off: Wash your hands before and after you touch the cord. Clean around the base of the cord if needed with cotton wool and cooled boiled water. Keep the belly button area dry after you clean it. Check the umbilical cord at every nappy change to make sure there is no redness there. Fold your baby's nappy down, away from the cord. After the stump falls off The umbilical stump will dry out, turn black and drop off. After the stump comes off, it usually takes about seven to 10 days for the belly button to heal completely. Ask your midwife or public health nurse for advice if you see any bleeding or discharge from your baby's belly button. Go to your GP if you see redness on the skin of your baby's stomach around the stump, or there is a foul smell.

This is called meconium. This will change later to a yellow colour. Day Wet nappies Dirty nappies Day 1 to 3 At least 1 to 2At least 1 to 2 black or dark green poos Day 3 to 5 At least 3, heavier At least 3 yellow poos Day 5 At least 5, heavyAt least 3 large soft and seedy yellow nappies How many nappies Most babies have: at least 6 wet nappies each day at least 1 dirty nappy each day - some breastfed babies may have more or less than this Some babies have a dirty nappy at every feed and others have a dirty nappy once a day. Your baby might not have a dirty nappy for one to two days. If the poo is soft when they have a dirty nappy, your baby is not constipated. You will soon see a pattern for your baby. Contact your public health nurse, GP or lactation consultant if you have any concerns. Smell and texture Breastfed babies usually have runny poos that do not smell. Formula-fed babies have poos that are usually more formed and smellier. If you have recently introduced formula, changed formula or introduced solids, then expect a change in texture, colour and smell. Pain relief and other medication will also cause changes. Nappy changing Bonding time Chat with your baby or toddler while changing their nappy. It makes the experience more pleasant for both of you.93 93 Caring for your childWhat you need You will need: a bowl filled with warm water a clean nappy clean clothes towels some cotton wool nappy disposal bag Plain waterPlain water (with no soap or detergent) is best for the first month. Always check water temperature with your elbow. Wipes If using wipes, make sure they are fragrance-free and alcohol-free. How to change a nappy 1. Get everything ready before you begin. 2. If you are using a changing table, make sure everything you need is within reach. 3. Wash your hands before removing the nappy. 4. Clean your baby's genitals and bottom with cotton wool and water or an unscented wipe. 5. Gently lift your baby's legs by holding their ankles. This allows you to clean underneath. 6. For girls and boys, always wipe from front to back. 7. For a baby boy, there is no need to retract the foreskin. Point his penis downwards before replacing the nappy. 8. Let the area dry. There is no need to use powders. 9. Slide a new and open nappy under your baby by gently lifting their legs at the ankles. The new nappy should be snug but not tight. 10. Wash your hands after changing the nappy.

Babies can roll off changing tables, beds and other raised surfaces. These falls can result in serious head injuries. Suffocation Nappy disposal bags and sacks and other plastic bags are a suffocation risk. The flimsy material of a nappy sack can cling to your baby's face causing suffocation. Do not store nappy sacks or any other plastic material within your baby's reach. For example, on the baby changer, cot, crib or anywhere your baby could crawl. Keep creams out of reach Keep creams and similar items out of your baby's sight and reach. They could cause your child to be sick if eaten. Constipation Your baby's poo should be bulky and soft. Constipation is when babies have difficulty passing stools (firm poos). The stools may be firm dry pellets which do not soak into the nappy. The poo passes more slowly. This may make your baby uncomfortable and disrupt their sleep. Straining Your baby may strain (grunt and become red in the face) when passing stools. This does not mean they are constipated if their poos are normal. It is important to know what is normal for your baby. Some babies have several poos each day, while others poo only once a day or once every second day. What is important is that the poos are soft and that they are easy to pass. Formula-fed babies tend to have bulkier poos and will need to poo more often than breastfed babies. Breastfed babies Breastfed babies rarely get constipated. Breastfed babies tend to have yellow-coloured seedy poos that are often quite soft. Newborn babies may poo after every breastfeed. Older breastfed babies may go up to a week without a bowel movement. This is not constipation once the stool is soft.95 95 Caring for your childCauses of constipation Your child could become constipated if they are: not drinking enough fluids (see below) not eating enough foods that contain fibre (see below) not active enough for their age ill or have a medical condition holding their poos in because it has hurt before How to prevent constipationAlways follow instructions on the formula milk packaging. Solids such as baby rice should never be added to a baby's bottle. These can choke your baby. They can also make your baby more likely to become constipated. Fluids Make sure your baby is having their daily fluid requirements (see below for babies under 6 months). Give them plenty to drink, such as breast milk or water. See pages 66 and 67 for information on suitable drinks. Until your baby is aged 12 months, make sure to boil and cool the water first before giving it to them. Foods that contain fibreGive your child high fibre food as part of a well-balanced diet, such as: whole grain breakfast cereals, bread, pasta and rice fruit and vegetables beans Dealing with constipation If you think your baby or child is becoming constipated simple things may help. Babies under 6 monthsMake sure your baby is getting their daily fluid requirements. They should be taking in 700 ml of fluids each day, from breast milk or formula milk. You can massage your baby's tummy in a clockwise direction. Make firm but gentle circular motions from the belly button outwards. You can try laying your baby on their back and gently moving their legs backwards and forwards in a 'bicycle' motion. Giving your baby a bath may help to relax their bowel.

Offer them fruits like pears, kiwis, apples and strawberries. Make sure the consistency is right for your child's age. See page 61. If you think your child is constipated, bring them to your GP . Contact your GP urgently if your child is constipated and has any of the following symptoms: severe pain and distress on pooing (passing a stool) bleeding from the back passage (rectum) fever vomiting bloated tummy losing weight or not gaining weight Nappy rash Nappy rash is a red, moist or broken area on your baby's nappy area. Most babies get nappy rash at some time in the first 18 months. Your baby can get nappy rash if: they are left too long in a dirty or wet nappy a rough nappy rubs against their skin they have a thrush infection their skin is sensitive to a soap, bath product or detergent like washing powder baby wipes that contain alcohol are used your baby is teething your baby or toddler has recently been on antibiotics Dealing with nappy rash Each time you change your child's nappy, gently clean their bottom with water and a soft cloth and pat it dry. Leave their nappy off for half an hour and allow the skin of their bottom to air dry.97 97 Caring for your childAdd a thin layer of a protective barrier cream - your pharmacist or public health nurse will be able to recommend one. Don't use bubble baths, talcum powder or any scented products on your baby. Sometimes it can be helpful to give the evening fluids early so that the nappy is not as wet overnight. Bring your baby or toddler to your GP if they are in discomfort. Your GP can prescribe an ointment to help to heal the nappy rash. Never apply raw egg or any other food directly onto your child's skin. Dressing your child 0 to 1 year Getting dressed is an opportunity for your baby to learn from your touch and voice. You can enjoy this time of smiling and talking to your baby. Your child will start to move around more from 6 months on. They will need several sets of clothes. This is because they will spend more time on the go. They can get dirty very quickly from crawling and walking about. 1 to 2 years Make dressing your toddler a game. Name their body parts and the clothes that cover them, like \"your hat is for your head\" or \"your sock is for your foot\". Your toddler learns different words and recognises the link between their clothes and where they fit. When your toddler is walking steadily, bring them to a shoe shop to have their feet measured correctly. Every 3 to 4 months, go back to get their feet re-measured. Child safety and clothes Your child is at risk from anything placed on or caught around their neck. Risks include being choked, strangled or suffocated. Never place any of the following on your baby or toddler: hair bands jewellery (including amber teething jewellery) strings cords belts ribbons soother clips ties clothes and hats with strings or cords attached Remove bibs after feeding and before putting them down for a sleep.

Clean their gums twice a day with a clean soft wash cloth or gauze. Tooth brushing Tooth brushing should be part of your child's daily routine. Good habits started early will last a lifetime. When the first tooth appears: Use a small soft toothbrush and water only. Do not use toothpaste if your child is under the age of 2 - unless you have been advised to do so by a dentist. Brush your child's teeth twice a day - the brush before bedtime is the most important routine to establish, as food left on the teeth overnight can lead to decay. If your child doesn't want their teeth brushed Your child might resist having their teeth brushed, or want to do it themselves. You can: sing a song as you brush their teeth, or reward them for letting you brush their teeth by allowing them to brush once you've finished.99 99 Caring for your childProtecting your child's teeth Fluids Only give your child fluids such as milk and water. Give cooled boiled water until your child is 1 year old. Fruit juice and fizzy drinks Juices for babies contain sugar, which can damage teeth. Never put sugary drinks, including fruit juice, into a bottle. Never give fizzy drinks to your child. They contain a lot of sugar and acid. Bottles Start using a cup or free flow beaker from 6 months old and wean your child off bottle- feeding by 12 months. Only give your child a bottle or feeding cup at feed times. Do not allow your child to move around with a bottle or feeding cup in their mouth. Do not allow your child to sleep or nap with a bottle or feeding cup in their mouth. Soothers Avoid giving a soother (dodie, dummy or pacifier) after 12 months. If you give your child a soother, make sure it is clean. Do not dip it in sugar, syrup, honey or anything sweet. Tips to help your child give up their soother Only use soothers at set times such as bedtime and remove the soother when your child is asleep. Take your child's soother out when they are trying to talk or busy playing. Give rewards but don't use food. For older children, try using a star chart to praise them. Don't replace lost soothers. Once your child has given up the soother, don't be tempted to give it back and stick with your decision - they will forget about it in time. Tooth decay Tooth decay is also called dental decay or dental caries. It is the destruction of the hard surfaces of the teeth. It happens when sugary foods and sugary drinks are broken down by bacteria in the mouth. This forms acids which destroy the tooth surfaces. Teeth are at risk of decay from the time they appear in the mouth. Children with tooth decay are at risk of pain, infection and the early loss of their baby teeth. Food and drinks that contain sugar can cause tooth decay. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie100 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieCaring for your child100Did you know? Tooth decay is the most common ongoing disease of childhood. It can be difficult to treat in very young children. Preventing tooth decay Avoid any foods and drinks that contain sugar as these can cause decay. Delay the introduction of sugary foods and drinks for as long as possible. This will help to prevent tooth decay. Bring your child for a visit to their dentist on a regular basis - normal dental check-ups can help prevent dental problems or spot them early on. Where there is a choice, have your home connected to a public water supply that has fluoride - children and adults who live in areas where fluoride is in their water supply have better teeth than those who don't. Healthy food for healthy teeth Encourage your child to eat foods that have a lot of calcium such as milk and cheese - calcium helps build strong teeth. Avoid sugary treats and read food labels carefully as sugar may also be called sucrose, glucose, fructose or maltose on labels. Remember: 'no added sugar' does not mean sugar-free. Encourage your child to eat fresh fruit as a healthy snack option. Baby teeth Healthy teeth allow your child to chew their food comfortably. They are also important for speech and for your child's appearance and self-confidence. Baby teeth hold the space for the new permanent teeth to come into the mouth when your child is older. Your child may be 12 years old or more before their last baby tooth falls out, so these teeth need to be kept healthy for a long time. Injuries to baby teeth Falls, bangs and bumps are part of daily life for your toddler, and injuries to the baby teeth can easily happen. A fall on the mouth can loosen, break, knock out or push a baby tooth up into the gum. This can cause damage to the developing adult (permanent) teeth. If your toddler injures or knocks out a tooth in a fall or accident, take them to their dentist to have their mouth and teeth checked. Do not try to put a knocked out tooth back in place as this could damage the adult tooth developing in the gum. 101 101 Caring for your childToilet training Toilet training is teaching your child to use the toilet instead of nappies. Many children are ready for this around the age of 2 although every child is different. By around age 2, your child may be able to let you know that they need to go to the toilet or they have a dirty nappy. Wait until your child is ready before you begin toilet training. Don't start at a time when other big changes are happening at home or in the family, for example if a new baby brother or sister has arrived. Tips to help prepare As you will have noticed by now, you have very little privacy with a small child and they even come in with you when you go to the toilet! Watching you helps to prepare them for when they start to toilet train. It is a good idea to: Leave a clean potty in the bathroom so your child gets used to seeing it. Start dressing your child in clothes that will be easy to pull up and down during potty training. It can be frustrating when accidents happen, but they are part of the process. Praise your child when they try, even if they do not go. Encourage them, and increase the praise when your child successfully uses the potty or toilet.

These diseases can cause serious illness or even death. When your child is given a vaccine, their body responds by making antibodies to fight the disease. Your child's vaccines are free of charge from your GP through the HSE. They are quick, safe and effective. No parent likes the idea of their baby being given an injection. Be ready with a hug for your baby and the vaccination will be forgotten in seconds. Your baby needs 5 visits to your GP to be fully vaccinated and protected against serious diseases by 13 months. Three of these visits take place in their first 6 months. It is important that your baby gets their vaccines at the right age. This means they are protected at the time when they are most at risk of becoming seriously unwell from the diseases. 103 103 Caring for your childDiseases your baby will be protected against You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie104 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieCaring for your child104Common side effects after vaccinations Children may get: redness, soreness or swelling in the area where the injection was given irritable If your child is very unwell after getting a vaccine, they may be sick for some other reason. Contact your GP , GP practice nurse or public health nurse if you are worried about your child. After the Meningitis B (MenB) vaccine Your baby may develop a fever after MenB vaccine at 2 months and 4 months. Give them 3 doses of liquid infant paracetamol as follows: 1. Give 2.5 mls (60mg) of liquid infant paracetamol at the time of the vaccination or shortly after. 2. Give a second dose of 2.5 mls (60mg) 4 to 6 hours after the first dose. 3. Give a third dose of 2.5 mls (60mg) 4 to 6 hours after the second dose. 4. If your baby still has a fever, give a fourth dose of 2.5 mls (60mg) 4 to 6 hours after the third dose. 5. Contact your GP if your baby still has a temperature after the fourth dose or if you are worried about them. You don't need to give your child paracetamol when they get the MenB vaccine at 12 months as the risk of fever is less. Your public health nurse will give you information about vaccines and your child's immunisation passpost on their first visit to your home. Your GP and GP practice nurse will also give you information at the 2 week and 6 week check (see page 6). See immunisation.ie for more information about your child's vaccines.105 105 When your child is sick When your child is sick Most children get ill at some stage. At first, you may be nervous when your new baby is ill, but you will quickly become confident as you get to know their routine and learn how to help when they are sick. Usually, you can care for your baby at home, as most illnesses pass quickly. Some common childhood illnesses are listed below with advice on what you can do to care for your child. Contact your GP if you are unsure what to do or worried about your child. Breastfeeding protects Breastfeeding your child will help to protect them against fevers, coughs and colds and tummy upsets. If your child does get sick, it is important to continue to breastfeed them. Breastfeeding provides antibodies to protect your child against future illness. If you are formula feeding, continue to feed your child when they are sick. Giving your child their usual milk feeds when they are ill is very important. Feeding will comfort your child and helps to ensure they get enough fluids. When to get urgent medical help When should I contact my GP or hospital emergency department? You should contact your GP or nearest hospital emergency department if your child: has a purple or red rash that looks unusual has a raised or sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head has a temperature of 38\u00b0C or over appears much paler and sleepier then usual and is hard to wake up has an unusual, non-stop or high pitched cry or scream has a fit (convulsion) has difficulty breathing or is blue around the lips or face is not feeding normally or refuses to feed has unusually dry nappies or less than three wet nappies in one day has diarrhoea at each nappy change for more than 24 hours, or has bloody diarrhoea You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie106 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick106Poison If you think that your child has been exposed to or taken poison, stay calm but act quickly. Call the Public Poisons Information Helpline on 01-809 2166. The helpline is open from 8am to 10pm every day. Outside of these hours, contact your GP or hospital. In an emergency call 999 or 112. See poisons.ie When should I call an ambulance? Always call 112 or 999 if your child is seriously ill or injured, or their life is at risk.Examples of medical emergencies include: difficulty breathing or is unconscious severe loss of blood, severe burns or scalds choking, fitting or convulsion severe head injury severe allergic reactions Know your Eircode It is a good idea to make a list of easy-to-follow directions to your home and put them in a visible place. An ambulance can find your home quickly if they have the Eircode. Find yours at eircode.ie In an emergency it can be difficult to think clearly. Take the thinking out of it by preparing your directions and having your Eircode somewhere prominent in your home in case you need it. Checking your child's temperature You should check your child's temperature if they: have flushed cheeks feel hotter than usual when you touch them, especially their chest, forehead, back or stomach feel clammy or sweaty are crankier than usual Using a digital thermometer Digital thermometers are the most accurate way to measure your child's temperature. You can buy these in your local pharmacy, supermarket or online. 107 107 When your child is sickIf your child is just out of a warm bath, or if they have been wrapped in warm clothing, wait for them to cool down before taking their temperature. Most digital thermometers are designed to be used in your child's armpit. 1. Lie your baby flat or sit an older child comfortably on your knee, and put the thermometer in their armpit. 2. Gently hold their arm against their side to keep the thermometer in place. The instructions that come with the thermometer will let you know how long you need to hold it for but many digital thermometers beep when they are ready. 3. The display on the thermometer will tell you your child's temperature. 4. Other thermometers like ear (tympanic) thermometers or strip thermometers may not be as accurate but are very popular. Mercury thermometers Never use an old-fashioned glass thermometer containing mercury. These can break, releasing small splinters of glass and highly poisonous mercury. They're no longer used in hospitals and you can't buy them in shops. If your child is exposed to mercury, call the Public Poisons Information Helpline immediately. Do: Always use the spoon or dosage syringe that comes with the medicine. Follow the dosage instructions very carefully. Give liquid medicines slowly to avoid choking. Keep medicines in their original containers. Keep all medicines, vitamins and food supplements out of children's reach and sight, and make sure lids are tightly closed.Giving medicine to young children You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie108 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick108Don't: Never give a medicine to a child without talking to a pharmacist, GP or public health nurse first. Don't use household spoons to give medicine - they come in different sizes and will not give your child the correct amount. Don't refer to medicine or vitamin tablets as 'sweets' as children may be tempted to find them to take more. Don't give aspirin to children under 16 unless a GP prescribes it - there is a risk of serious illness. Paracetamol Make sure you use the right type of paracetamol for your child's age. Check the correct dose for your child. It is dangerous to take too much paracetamol. Ask your pharmacist for advice and read all labels carefully. Ibuprofen You can give ibuprofen for pain and fever to children of 3 months and over who weigh more than 5kg (11lbs). Check the correct dose for your child's age. Poison risk Call the Public Poisons Information Helpline on (01) 809 2166 if you: are worried your child has taken too much medicine, or think that they may have taken medicine without your supervision The helpline is open from 8am to 10pm every day. Outside of these hours, contact your GP , GP out of hours service or hospital. In an emergency call 999 or 112. ! Common illnesses Fever A fever is a high temperature of 38\u00b0C or above. Most high temperatures are caused by viral infections like colds and flus. Occasionally a high temperature can be a sign that your child has more serious infection, like meningitis (see page 122).109 109 When your child is sickReducing a fever To help reduce your child's temperature, encourage them to drink lots of fluids such as their regular milk feeds. You may also need to give your child extra cooled boiled water to prevent dehydration. Remove their outer clothes to allow extra heat to escape from their body. Medications Medications such as liquid paracetamol or ibuprofen can be given to lower their temperature. But if your child is comfortable and appears well, medication may not be needed. If you do give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen, always read the instructions. Ibuprofen is usually not advised for children under the age of 3 months. Keep all medicines out of sight and reach of children. When to get help Contact your GP immediately if your child is: under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38\u00b0C or over between 3 and 6 months old and has a temperature of 39\u00b0C showing other signs of being unwell such as drowsiness, refusal to feed or persistent vomiting Febrile convulsion A febrile convulsion is a seizure. It's sometimes called a fit. It can happen if your child has a very high temperature. The febrile convulsion may last for several minutes. Afterwards your child may be sleepy and limp. During a febrile convulsion, your child may: become stiff and their arms and legs may begin to jerk lose consciousness and may wet or soil themselves foam at the mouth or vomit turn blue roll back their eyes How to help your child Make a note of the time that the convulsion started. Lie your child on one side with their head tilted back slightly - this makes sure that their airway stays clear. Do not put anything in your child's mouth. Do not try to restrain them or shake them. When the seizure stops, try to lower your child's temperature to help them feel comfortable - make sure the room is warm but remove outer layers of clothing. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie110 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick110Most convulsions will stop after a few minutes. If this is the case, no further treatment of the seizure is needed but you should bring your child to a hospital emergency department that treats children as soon as possible. Sometimes they will need to be treated for whatever has caused their high temperature. When to get help Contact an ambulance by ringing 999 or 112 if: a seizure lasts for more than 5 minutes another seizure begins soon after the first one ends Seeing your child have a febrile convulsion can be very frightening but they are usually harmless and most children make a full recovery. Although there is unlikely to be anything serious wrong, it is still important to bring your child to a hospital emergency department that treats children for a check-up afterwards. Croup Croup is a type of cough that is common in young children up to the age of 3. It is caused by a viral infection of the voice box (larynx) and wind pipe (trachea). Your child may have a barking cough, be hoarse or make a harsh sound when breathing. How to help your child Croup usually gets better on its own after 48 hours. Until then, stay calm. If your child senses that you are stressed they may panic, which may make it harder for them to breathe. Reassure them and comfort them. Keep them upright and don't let them lie down. Give them fluids to drink such as water or their usual milk feeds. Don't give them any cough medicine, any herbal remedies or any medications that haven't been prescribed. Don't put your child in a steamy room or get them to inhale steam. When to get help The symptoms of croup are often mild, but they can become severe and things can change quickly. Occasionally children need to be admitted to hospital for treatment of their croup. Always bring your child to the GP if you think they have croup. If their symptoms are severe or if they are finding it hard to breathe, bring them to your local emergency department that treats children.111 111 When your child is sickCoughs and colds Most coughs are caused by viruses like colds and flus. There is no quick way of getting rid of a cough, and they often last for up to 3 weeks. If your child is drinking fluids and is in fairly good form, they can usually be cared for at home. Give them plenty of fluids to drink, such as their usual milk feeds, and offer food as usual. Blocked nose If your child's nose is blocked, you can wipe it gently. Saline drops can also be helpful, ask your pharmacist for advice. If your child has a fever or if they are in discomfort, children's paracetamol or ibuprofen can help. Always read the instructions before giving these medications. Ibuprofen is not recommended for children under 3 months. A warm and moist atmosphere can also help. Try taking your child into the bathroom which is still steamy from a hot bath or shower. Make sure to keep your child away from the hot water so they are not at risk of being scalded. You could also use a humidifier, which makes the atmosphere moist. If you do this, position the humidifier safely and out of reach of your children. When to get help Contact your GP if your child: has a cough or other cold symptoms lasting for more than 3 weeks is getting worse rather than better is rubbing or pulling at their ears and seems irritable seems wheezy (making noise when they are breathing) is refusing their milk feeds or not drinking fluids shows any other worrying symptoms like a rash or a headache You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie112 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick112Go immediately to your GP or nearest hospital emergency department that treats children if your child is finding it hard to breathe. Ear infections An ear infection is an illness in the outer, middle or inner ear. It is usually caused by a virus. Most ear infections will clear up after 3 to 4 days. They can be painful so you may need to give your child liquid paracetamol or ibuprofen. Ask your pharmacist for advice. Signs that your child has an ear infection may include: a temperature irritability and restlessness touching or pulling at the ear no interest in feeding Older children may complain of earache and reduced hearing.! To help your child Do not use a cotton bud or anything else to poke inside their ear, as it may cause damage and pain. Do give children's paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce the pain - but always read the instructions first.113 113 When your child is sickWhen to get help Take your child to the GP if: you are worried there is a discharge from the ear they seem very unwell or drowsy, or are not taking fluids Antibiotics do not work against viral infections. They will not reduce the pain of an ear infection. Your GP will only prescribe an antibiotic if your child's ear infection has been caused by bacteria. Vomiting Small vomits (possets) after a feed can be normal and common in young babies. Your baby will grow out of this. If your child is alert, behaving normally and feeding well, keep feeding them as normal and offer regular drinks of their usual milk or cooled boiled water. When to get help Contact your GP if: your child is repeatedly vomiting or unable to hold down fluids they have been vomiting for more than 2 days the vomiting is forceful or projectile the vomit is green or contains blood your child is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38\u00b0C or higher your child is 3 to 6 months old and has a temperature of 39\u00b0C or higher, or your child has any signs of being dehydrated (dried out) such as drowsiness, not wetting many nappies or crying without tears Babies or toddlers with vomiting should not go to cr\u00e8che or a child minder until 48 hours after the last vomit. Sticky eyes It is very common for newborns and small babies to have 'sticky eyes'. Sticky eyes means that there is a yellow discharge from your child's eye. The white of the eye is not usually red, and your child is not usually distressed by this. Sometimes your child's eye can be crusted over and it can be hard for your child to open their eye. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie114 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick114How to help your child Often no treatment is needed. Sometimes you may need to wipe or clean your child's eye. Always wash your hands before and after doing this. Use a sterile cotton ball dampened in saline solution to gently wipe your child's eye. Wipe from the inside corner to the outside corner. Use a new cotton ball for each time you wipe. Once you have bathed the eye, dry it using a different cotton wool ball and going from the inside corner to the outside. When to get help Contact your GP if: your baby's sticky eye is getting worse the white of your baby's eye is red your baby seems distressed and is doing things like rubbing their eyes a lot or seems to be in pain your baby does not like to open their eyes you are worried your baby might have conjunctivitis (the white of their eye is red) or if they have been in contact with someone who has conjunctivitis, such as an older sibling If your child has sticky eyes but doesn't have these symptoms, mention it to your GP or public health nurse the next time you see them. They may show you ways to massage your baby's tear duct. If your child's eye is still sticky after 12 months, visit your GP . They may refer your baby to see an ophthalmologist (a specialist eye doctor). Thrush (candida) Oral thrush or candida is an overgrowth of yeast fungus in your baby's mouth. It usually causes a white coating on your baby's tongue. It can also cause white patches in other parts of the mouth. This coating usually does not brush away when you touch it. Oral thrush might affect your baby's feeding. It can also be on your baby's bottom. It looks like a red rash with white spots or it can make the skin look like it is peeling. 115 115 When your child is sickWhen to get help Contact your public health nurse, GP or pharmacist to find out how to treat thrush. If you are breastfeeding and your baby has oral thrush, you could develop thrush on your nipples. You will normally be advised to continue breastfeeding but to apply an antifungal cream to your nipples. It is very important to sterilise all bottles and soothers up to the age of 12 months. If an older child (over 12 months) gets thrush in their mouth, you should sterilise all bottles and soothers. Tummy upsets or gastroenteritis If your child has a tummy upset with vomiting, diarrhoea or both, then they can get dehydrated (dried out). It is particularly important to make sure they get enough fluid to drink. How to help your child Fluids Continue offering your child their normal milk feeds, either breastfeeding or formula. Give them enough to drink in small sips of fluid. See pages 66 and 67 for more information on suitable drinks for your child. Don't worry too much about food - fluids are the most important thing while your child is ill. If your child hasn't lost their appetite, it's fine for them to eat solid foods as normal. Signs of dehydration Look out for signs of dehydration such as not wetting many nappies, having a dry mouth, being drowsy or having no tears. If your child is starting to show mild signs of dehydration, ask your GP or pharmacist if you should give them oral rehydration solution. Oral rehydration solution is a special powder that you make into a drink. It contains sugar and salts to help replace the water and salts lost through vomiting and diarrhoea. High temperature or tummy pains If your child is uncomfortable with a high temperature or tummy pains, you can give them liquid paracetamol. Always read the label to make sure you give the correct dose to your child. Keep all medicines out of your child's sight and reach. When to get help Contact your GP if your child: is not drinking fluids or has any signs of dehydration has blood in their poo, or has had 6 or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or 3 or more episodes of vomiting You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie116 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick116The 48 hour rule Children with vomiting or diarrhoea should not attend their cr\u00e8che or childminder for 48 hours after their last vomit or runny poo. Regularly wash your hands to avoid spreading any illness. VTEC (Verotoxigenic E. coli) VTEC (Verotoxigenic E. coli) is a serious type of gastroenteritis that can result in complications such as kidney failure. A child infected with VTEC often has: diarrhoea (this might be bloody) stomach pains high temperature About 1 in 10 children with VTEC can develop serious complications from it, where the kidneys stop working properly. This is called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Bring your child to your GP if they have: diarrhoea that is not setting, or bloody diarrhoea VTEC is very infectious, and can spread very easily in families, cr\u00e8ches and at childminders. This is why children with VTEC are not allowed to attend cr\u00e8ches or other childminding facilities until they are free of infection. Go to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre website at hpsc.ie for more information on VTEC. Chickenpox Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Your child can catch it by coming into contact with someone who has chickenpox. If your child has not had chickenpox before, they can also catch chickenpox from someone with shingles. The most obvious chickenpox symptom is a red rash that can cover the entire body. Your child may have a fever and some mild flu-like symptoms before the rash appears. Flu-like symptoms can include feeling unwell, a runny nose and aches and pains.117 117 When your child is sickChickenpox spots Soon after the flu-like symptoms, an itchy rash appears. Some children may only have a few spots, but others are covered from head to toe. Most healthy children recover from chickenpox with no lasting ill-effects. But some are unlucky and have a more severe illness than usual. Unusual symptoms Contact your GP straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms, for example, if: the skin surrounding the blisters becomes red and painful they start to get pain in the chest or have difficulty breathing your child is very unwell and you are concerned Your child may need prescription medicine and possibly hospital treatment. How chickenpox is spread Chickenpox is highly contagious. This means it is very easy for your child to catch chickenpox if they never had it before. If someone in your home has chickenpox, there is about a 90% chance that others will catch it if they are not immune. Chickenpox is spread by being in the same room as someone who has it. It can also be caught by touching clothes or bedding that has fluid from the blisters on it. Chickenpox is most infectious from one to two days before the rash appears until the blisters have all crusted over. This means that a child could be spreading chickenpox before anyone knows that they have it. It can take between 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with chickenpox for symptoms to appear. How to help your child The virus usually clears up by itself without any treatment. There are ways of easing the itch and discomfort and steps you can take to stop chickenpox spreading. Fever and pain Give your child liquid paracetamol. It will help ease any pain they may be feeling and may help to control their temperature. Do not give your child ibuprofen if they have chickenpox. Research has found that serious skin reactions are more common in children with chickenpox who have been given ibuprofen. !

Sugar-free ice-lollies are a good way of getting fluids into children. They also help to soothe a sore mouth that has chickenpox spots in it. See pages 66 and 67 for information on suitable drinks for your child. Avoid any food that may make your child's mouth sore, such as salty foods. Stop the scratching Chickenpox can be incredibly itchy, but it's important that children do not scratch the spots. Not scratching will help them to avoid having scars after they recover. Get a soothing cream or gel in the pharmacy - this may help the itch and cool your child's skin. Ask your pharmacist if medication for the itch known as antihistamines might help - a sedating antihistamine can be used on children over the age of 1 and may help them to sleep at night. Dress your child in comfy clothes that won't make them overheat - getting too hot might make their itch worse. Bathe them in lukewarm water - a hot bath can make the itch worse. Pat their skin dry after a bath, don't rub. Keep their fingernails clean and short - you can also put socks over your child's hands at night to stop them scratching the rash as they sleep. Your child will need to stay away from childcare and baby or toddler groups until all the spots have crusted over. This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared. It is a good idea to let your cr\u00e8che or childminder know that your child has chickenpox, so they can alert other parents. Complications Some children are at risk of complications from chickenpox. These include: babies under the age of 1 month children with serious health problems such as heart and lung disease children on medications such as chemotherapy Contact your GP if your child has any of these issues and you think they have been exposed to chickenpox.!119 119 When your child is sickWhen to get help Call your GP urgently if your child has chickenpox and they have: redness, pain and heat in the skin around a blister or spot breathing problems symptoms of dehydration certain skin conditions like eczema headaches that don't go away after giving paracetamol, or are getting worse Call your nearest hospital emergency department that treats children if your child has chickenpox and they: have trouble walking or are very weak are drowsy or hard to wake Call 999 or 112 if your child has chickenpox and they have a fit or seizure. Ring ahead if you are bringing your child with chickenpox to the GP or hospital. Your GP may arrange to see your child at a time when the surgery is quiet. This will reduce the risk of chickenpox spreading to vulnerable patients, for example, newborn babies. Call your GP if you are pregnant and you know you are not immune to chickenpox or if you are not sure. Hand, foot and mouth disease Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a group of viruses which usually affects young children. It causes blisters on hands, feet and in the mouth. Children may also have a sore throat and high temperature. These symptoms last for seven to 10 days. The vast majority of children who get hand, foot and mouth disease make a full recovery. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie120 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieWhen your child is sick120Did you know? Not the same as foot and mouth disease Hand, foot and mouth disease is not the same as foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs. The two infections are unrelated. You cannot catch hand, foot and mouth disease from animals. How it spreads The virus is spread by coughs and sneezes, and is also found in the poo of infected children. Some children infected with the virus do not have symptoms but can still pass it to others. How long before symptoms appear Symptoms start 3 to 5 days after exposure to the virus. How long children remain infectious Children who are ill are infectious. They may also carry the virus in their poo for many weeks after they have recovered and this means they can continue to pass on infection. How to prevent the spread of disease The virus is found in poo. Make sure you wash your hands very carefully, especially: before preparing food after changing your child's nappy, or helping your child use the potty or toilet How to help your childThere is no specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease - it is usually a mild illness that goes away of its own accord. If a child feels unwell, liquid paracetamol may help. Always read the label. Keep it out of sight and reach of your children. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids. When to get help Contact your GP if you are concerned or if your child has any of the symptoms listed on page 105.121 121 When your child is sickSkin conditions Eczema Eczema is a very common skin condition that affects one in five children. It is caused by inflammation in the skin. It causes the skin to become itchy, dry, red and cracked. The most common type of eczema is 'atopic eczema'. This is also sometimes called 'atopic dermatitis'. Most children with atopic eczema develop it before the age of one. Bring your child to your GP if you think they have eczema. Cradle cap Cradle cap looks like dry, flaky or yellowish-crusted skin on your baby's scalp. Cradle cap will usually go away on its own. Tips to help reduce the build-up of scales on the scalp Wash the scalp regularly with a baby shampoo, followed by gentle brushing with a soft brush to loosen scales. Soften the scales with baby oil first, followed by gentle brushing, and then wash off with baby shampoo. Soak the crusts overnight with white petroleum jelly, or vegetable or olive oil, and shampoo in the morning. If these methods don't work, talk to your pharmacist about using a greasy emollient or soap substitute, such as emulsifying ointment.

Many babies get slightly jaundiced in the first few days after birth. This is because your baby's liver is not yet ready to fully break down blood cells. Contact your midwife, GP or public health nurse if you think your baby is jaundiced. Milk spots Milk spots or milia are tiny white spots on your baby's face and neck. They are harmless tiny white cysts filled with a protein known as keratin. They will go away after a few weeks without any treatment. Other rashes Babies can get rashes which are difficult to identify. These include heat rash - this fades once the baby is cooled down. Bring them your child to your GP if they have a rash and you are unsure what is causing it. Meningitis and septicaemia Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. There are two main types of meningitis: bacterial and viral. Septicaemia is a blood poisoning caused by bacteria. Symptoms of meningitis or septicaemia Children with meningitis or septicaemia won't usually have every symptom. They might not have a rash. Symptoms can appear in any order.

After this, steady weight gain is a sign that your baby is healthy and feeding well. Your public health nurse and GP will help you if your baby has not regained their birth weight by 2 weeks or is losing weight. They may look for signs of medical problems. If you are breastfeeding, your public health nurse will talk to you about how feeding is going and may ask to watch when you are giving a feed. Checking your baby's weight After the first 2 weeks, your child will be weighed by: your GP at the 6 week check your public health nurse at each developmental check Many public health nurses also run 'well baby' clinics where you can bring your baby to be weighed. Healthy weight gain Most children are about three times their birth weight by one year of age - but this is just an average measurement. Your child may gain weight slower or faster than usual. Sometimes weight gain can be slow if your child was premature or if they have been sick and off their feeds. To help your toddler's healthy growth and development, they should have at least 3 hours of physical activity spread throughout the day. This can be anything that gets a toddler moving. Examples include crawling, walking, moving around the house, dancing, playing outside or exploring.

Your child's head circumference may be measured: around the time of birth at the 6 week check with your GP at the 3 month developmental assessment with your public health nurse The head circumference gives an indication about how well your baby's brain is growing. Growth charts Your GP or public health nurse will record their measurements of your child's weight, length or head circumference. These results may be plotted on a growth chart. Growth charts show the pattern of growth healthy children usually follow. There are different charts for boys and girls because they usually have slightly different growth patterns. Centiles When you look at a growth chart, you may notice that it has curved lines. These lines are called centiles. These show the average weight and height gain for children of different ages. The growth of your child will usually roughly follow a centile line. Posture and movement Every child is different and will develop at their own rate. This section is a guide to the milestones that your child will achieve as they develop. The ages given are averages, and it is normal for children to gain one skill earlier than another. For example, some children are slow to walk but their speech may develop earlier than expected. If your baby was premature, this can affect the way they develop. Your baby may need more appointments to check their development if they were premature. 127 127 Your child's growth and developmentEach child is different What is important is how your child is developing overall. Try not to worry too much about the exact age at which certain milestones occur. For each milestone, there is a wide range of ages when children may reach it. You can support your child's growth and development with many simple activities. If you are worried about your child's development or hearing, talk with your GP or public health nurse. Your child's milestones Here is a guide to your child's development, including their social and emotional development.

This means playing on the floor with you and toys appropriate to their age. Floor-based play includes tummy time. Tummy time should start from birth. Try to do tummy time three to four times a day for short periods of time. Tummy time helps to strengthen their head, neck and back muscles. It also lets your baby experience feeling to the front of their body. Place your baby on a firm and flat surface for tummy time. During the day you can place your baby on their tummy with their hands out at either side to support themselves. You must stay close to your baby while they are in this position. If your baby falls asleep when on their tummy, always place them onto their back to reduce the risk of cot death. Your baby shouldn't be inactive or in a restricted position for any longer than 1 hour, except when sleeping. See page 167 for a guide on how to play with your baby and toddler and how this helps their development.

You can lie flat or prop yourself up on pillows. Place your baby on your chest or tummy so that you're face-to-face. Always hold your baby firmly for safety. Eye-level smile Get down level with your baby to encourage eye contact. Roll up a blanket and place it under their chest and upper arms for added support. Lap soothe Place your baby face-down across your lap to burp or soothe them. A hand on your baby's bottom will help them feel steady and calm. Tummy-down carry Carry your baby 'tummy down'. To do this, slide one hand under the tummy and between the legs. Nestle your baby close to your body. Tummy minute Place your baby on their tummy for one or two minutes every time you change them. Information and images reproduced from pathways.org.131 131 Your child's growth and developmentHow your child communicates with you From birth to 12 months 0 to 3 months Your newborn baby has a wide range of ways to communicate with you. How they comunicate Crying is one way your baby communicates with you that they need something. Your baby also communicates through facial expressions and body movements. Through these behaviours, your baby is communicating important messages about their feelings to you. Most interested in you Your baby is learning to pay attention to new sights, sensations and sounds. Above anything else, your baby is most interested in looking at your face and hearing your voice. You are your baby's best toy! You are the most important person in your baby's life. Your baby can express their interest in you by looking at you and beginning to smile. Cooing Your baby is learning how to take turns in conversations. They can make sounds like \"eee\" and \"ahhh\". This is called cooing. 4 to 6 months Your baby can now make even more noises to get your attention. They can use different noises to communicate their feelings. Babbling You may notice your baby beginning to babble, for example \"ba ba ba\" or \"da da da\". This is your baby's way of using their sounds. They are letting you know they are interested in having a conversation with you. Reacting to voices You may notice your baby gets excited when they hear voices, especially yours! They might express this excitement by kicking their legs, waving their arms or making noises. You might notice your baby starting to laugh and squeal with enjoyment. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie132 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour child's growth and development132Touch Your baby can reach out and grasp objects that are close by. They often enjoy reaching out to touch your face, building their connection with you. 6 to 12 months Your baby's communication skills are growing dramatically. You might notice your baby puts lots of sounds together by using either: babbling, for example \"ma ma ma\" or \"da da da\", or longer babbling that includes longer sequences of sounds, for example \"ada abu mada kala...\" You might also notice your baby: pointing at an object that interests them and then getting your attention by looking at you and back at the object looking at you when you talk or when they hear their name being called copying some sounds you make, such as coughing or making 'raspberries' enjoying games like 'peek a boo' or 'row the boat' on your lap starting to understand some words like \"bye bye\", \"no\" or \"all gone\", especially when you use a gesture at the same time understanding the names of familiar objects or people, like \"mammy\", \"daddy\", \"teddy\" or \"cup\".133 133 Your child's growth and developmentWays to support your baby's communication Your baby loves following your cues. The relationship you have is the most important way to help their language and communication develop. Watch and tune into your baby's facial expressions, eye gaze and body movements. Wonder about what your baby is thinking, feeling or showing interest in. Respond to your baby by: Talking Talk to them about what they are doing, for example \"You're looking at the light.\" Going slowly It's important to match your baby's pace when you are playing together. Your baby's brain needs time to process new experiences and words. Getting face to face Your baby will love looking at your eyes and smiling. This helps their speech and language to develop. Find a comfortable distance (approximately arm's length) that allows your baby to focus on your face. Listening Listen to your baby. Leave little pauses for your baby to take their turn. This shows them that you are interested in their thoughts and feelings. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie134 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour child's growth and development134Copying your baby and waiting Copy their sounds or actions and wait. For example, if your baby says \"bababa\", repeat back \"bababa\" with enthusiasm. Wait to see if your baby is interested in taking another turn. Speaking your native language Talk to your baby in your native language. This is best for their speech and language development. This will also nurture your important relationship with your baby. In two-parent families, this could mean your baby is exposed to two or more languages from birth. For example, if one parent speaks in their native Polish and the other parent talks to them in their native English. Comforting your baby when they cry Providing lots of love and comfort helps your baby feel safe and secure with you. Responding to your baby's cries helps build healthy self-esteem. It also sets a strong foundation for their growing communication development.135 135 Your child's growth and developmentOther fun activities to try Songs and nursery rhymes Sing songs and nursery rhymes with your baby. Picture books Snuggle up and share a picture book together. Allow your baby to hold the book. Notice what your baby is interested in and talk about that for example, \"You see the monkey!\" At this stage, this is more important than reading the words in the book. Play on the floor Your baby can learn so much language through playing with you. At this stage, your baby might enjoy touching or holding little toys with different feels, like soft blocks or a rattle. Pace your play to suit your baby. You can repeat lots of new words, for example \"shake shake\" or \"the ball feels squishy!\" Peek-a-boo Social games like \"Peek-a-boo\" are a lot of fun and a great way to encourage your baby's communication and concentration. Sensory books Your baby will really enjoy 'touch and feel' sensory books. Allow your baby to hold the book and notice how they look at the pictures and touch the pages. Notice what your baby is interested in and talk about that, for example \"the cat feels furry!\" Blocks Your baby might enjoy banging blocks together or putting blocks into a cup. They might like to play with a ball, a pop-up toy or bubbles with you. These games allow you to repeat lots of new words such as \"the block is in the cup\" or \"pop the bubble\". From 12 to 24 months This is an amazing time in your toddler's language development. During this period, one of the most exciting milestones arrives - their first words. There is often a huge spurt of language growth between 12 to 24 months. During this time, your toddler's understanding of language is growing fast. They are beginning to: understand some simple words and short phrases such as \"it's bath time\" or \"where's the ball?\" understand some simple action words, for example \"who's eating?\" or \"who's sleeping?\" You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie136 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour child's growth and development136 identify some body parts, for example eyes, nose, mouth, hands recognise and point to familiar objects, people or pictures when asked, for example \"where's teddy?\" or \"where's daddy?\" Your toddler will begin to use more and more words. You will notice your toddler: using single words to express their thoughts, feelings or ideas - they might point and say \"mama\" to communicate \"there's mammy\" combining babble and real words to try to form sentences pointing at things that interest them and asking \"what's that?\" - it helps your child to build their growing vocabulary when you answer these questions saying the same words over and over to practise their new vocabulary As they approach 2 years of age, your toddler may start joining two words together, for example \"daddy ball\" or \"teddy jump\". How to support your toddler's communication Just like when they were a baby, your toddler's communication will thrive through your spending time with them. It is important that you continue to tune into their facial expressions and sounds. Show interest in what they are doing and respond to them by: describing your daily activities together, for example \"that's the car\" and \"we're changing your nappy\" adding words to your toddler's sentences, for example if they say \"kick ball\" you could say \"yes, mammy is kicking the ball\" - this helps them to use longer sentences when they are ready Use actions with your words For example, wave when you say \"bye bye\" or shake your head when you say \"no\". This makes it easier for your toddler to understand your words and gives them more ways to communicate with you too. Give \"it\" a name Instead of saying \"there it is\", you could say \"there's the ball\" or \"there's the bubble\". This will help them to become familiar with a range of specific words. Speak slowly and clearly When talking with your toddler, speak slowly and clearly, so that they have the best opportunity to hear the sounds at the beginning, middle and end of the words. This will help to develop their speech sounds. Stay calm when they're being challenging Staying calm will help your toddler to learn how to deal and emotions. It also encourages good self-esteem and sets a strong foundation for their growing communication and later speech and language development.137 137 Your child's growth and developmentUse words to describe your toddler's feelings Name the emotions your toddler is experiencing, for example, happy, excited, sad or upset. This gives your child the words to understand and talk about their own and others' feelings. This is very important for your child's emotional awareness and development. Limit screen time Screens can be smartphones, gaming devices, tablets, computers and televisions. Try to limit screen time to under one hour per day for 18 to 24 month olds. It is not recommended for children under 18 months to have any screen time. Watching too much on screens can take time away from special interactions with your toddler that are important for speech and language development. Limit soothers Try to limit your toddler's use of soothers, especially when they are awake. Soothers can lead to difficulties with their teeth and speech. Fun activities to try with your toddler Ideas include: Action songs and nursery rhymes Sing action songs and nursery rhymes with your toddler. Repeat the same songs and go slowly, so that your toddler can become familiar with the rhythm. \"This little piggy went to the market...\" is a fun rhyme to sing during nappy change or after bath time. When your toddler starts using their first words, try leaving out the last word of the rhyme for your toddler to say, for example: \"They all fall...\" Books Most toddlers enjoy books with simple stories or about their favourite characters. Encourage them to join in for repetitive lines of the story. It is best to follow your toddler's interest in the book - this may involve describing the pictures instead of reading the story.Floor play Play on the floor with your toddler, they can learn so much language through play. Other games Your toddler might enjoy imaginary games, jigsaws, painting and much more. These games allow you to interact and talk with them and to support their growing speech and language development.

The information in this book is a guide only. If you are worried about your toddler's communication development, contact your: public health nurse GP Possible signs your child is not developing as expected All children develop at their own pace. Try not to compare your child with other children. If you are worried about your child's development at any stage, always speak to your public health nurse or GP . Sometimes children learn a new skill like waving, and then seem to become bored of it. This can be normal. But if your child seems to be losing skills that they had it is a good idea to speak with your public health nurse or GP . For example, if your child stops talking. Trust your instincts. You know your child better than anyone else. If your child was premature Remember that if your baby was premature, they may follow a different pattern of development. Sometimes your paediatrician, public health nurse or GP will assess their milestones based on their due date, and not the date they were actually born. By the age of 2 or 3, the development of premature babies tends to be similar to that of other children their age, and you can start using their actual age when looking at their milestones. Your paediatrician, paediatric nurse, public health nurse and GP will give you more information. Things you should look out for 0 to 6 months Talk to your GP or public health nurse if your child: does not move, or appears not to be using both arms and both legs does not hold their head up by 3 months does not seem to see or hear things has an unusual cry, for example, high-pitched is not smiling by 6 to 8 weeks keeps one or both hands clenched into a fist after 4 months139 139 Your child's growth and development6 to 12 months Talk to your GP or public health nurse if your child: is very reluctant to start solid foods from about 6 to 7 months on does not hold toys when offered to them is not able to sit unsupported by 10 months does not use both hands equally is not crawling or moving forward in some way does not smile or laugh out loud does not make different sounds when they speak does not turn towards you when you call their name does not make eye contact with you does not show pleasure when seeing you and other familiar people is constantly irritable and unable to soothe themselves or gain comfort from you has difficulty establishing a sleeping, waking and feeding pattern fails to gain weight even though they seem healthy 1 to 2 yearsTalk to your GP or public health nurse if your child: is mainly silent when playing or does not babble a lot is not able to point to objects and toys that you name is not walking by 18 months or walks on their toes only does not imitate actions or words is not using some words or phrases by 18 months does not follow simple instructions by 2 years old does not listen when others are talking does not show any anxiety or upset when they are separated from you has difficulty interacting with you and other caregivers, including not making eye contact with you clings to you a lot and does not like changes in their routine does not show affection to familiar people is not responding to the limits you set and can be very stubborn or defiant in their contacts with you and others Ask your public health nurse to perform an 'ages and stages questionnaire' on your child if you are concerned about any aspect of their development.

As a parent you may have difficult feelings to cope with. You may also have to make additional decisions for your child and your family. Your GP and public health nurse are there to help. They can offer information and support to guide you. They can also refer you to other services that you may need. Useful websites When your child is diagnosed with a particular condition, you may look for information online. You should always remember that while the internet is a great source of information, there is also a lot of information that is out of date, unreliable or incorrect. The information you find online may not be relevant to your child's own needs, even if it is about the same condition. Each child is different. If you have recently found out about your child's disability or developmental delay, you may find informingfamilies.ie helpful. Talking to other parents Although everyone's experience is different, it can be helpful to speak to other parents who have children with needs similar to your child's. They are likely to have been through the same emotions and pathways. They may be able to offer you some practical advice. The Special Needs Parents Association is run by parents to provide families of children with disability or special needs with support and information. See specialneedsparents.ie 141 141 Your child's growth and developmentServices for children with special needs When a child is diagnosed with a disability or there are concerns that their development may be delayed, it is important that parents are supported to provide the extra care their child needs to reach his or her potential. Your child may need services such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy. Parents can find out about how to encourage their child's development and get advice on practical issues. What services you and your child are offered depends on the needs of your child. Health services for children with a disability or developmental delay are provided by the HSE itself or by certain voluntary organisations which receive funding from the HSE. Many children with delays in their development can have their needs met by their local HSE primary care services such as a community speech and language therapist or physiotherapist. Children's disability teams provide services for children with more complex needs, who require the support of a team of professionals working closely together. Children's disability services vary across the country. You can see a list of the services in your area at hse.ie/childdisability or talk to your public health nurse about what's available near you and how to get your child referred to a service that may help them.

They may show signs of teething from about 13 weeks. Your child should have most of their 20 baby teeth by the time they are 2-and-a-half years old. Every child is born with a complete set of 20 baby teeth growing under their gums. Signs your baby is teething Your baby may: have red and flushed cheeks dribble - wipe this away from the skin folds on their neck because this can cause soreness chew on their fists or on their toys more than usual have sore and tender gums and cry more have a nappy rash Contact your public health nurse or GP if your child has a raised temperature, diarrhoea or generally seems unwell. This is not caused by teething. Helping your teething baby It's upsetting to see your baby in discomfort from teething. Comforting and playing with them will help distract them.149 149 Your child's growth and developmentHere are some other ways you can help: try giving your baby something to chew on such as a cool teething ring massage your child's sore gums with a sugar-free teething gel use mild sugar-free pain relief if your child wakes at night and is irritable give cold water to drink - this helps to keep babies hydrated and may also soothe their gums (remember to boil and cool water before giving it to a baby under 12 months) give healthy foods to chew on - but only do this if they're 6 months or older and stay close to your baby when they are eating in case they choke Teething rings Chewing on a cool and clean teething ring can help soothe your baby's gums as well as distracting them from the pain. You can cool some teething rings in the fridge. Always check the product instructions for how long to cool the ring. Never put the ring in the freezer as this could damage your baby's gums. Keep a spare clean teething ring in the fridge. Let your baby hold the teething ring. Never place it on a string around their neck as this might strangle them. You can also give your baby a cold wet facecloth to chew on. Teething gels and pain relief Sugar-free teething gels are available over the counter from the pharmacy. They contain a mild local anaesthetic which helps numb any pain. These are for babies older than 4 months. Always make sure the product you use is suitable for your baby's age and ask your pharmacist for advice. If your baby is still in discomfort after using teething gels, consider giving them sugar-free paracetamol or ibuprofen medication for babies. Don't use ibuprofen medication if your baby is under the age of 3 months. Contact your GP or pharmacist for information on the safe use of gels and pain relief. Homeopathic teething products There are some unlicensed homeopathic products sold online. These are not safe to use for babies. Research into these products shows that they may cause serious side effects. These include difficulty breathing, seizures, agitation, excessive sleepiness, constipation and difficulty urinating. This warning does not apply to Nelson's homeopathic teething products sold in Ireland with the brand name of 'Teetha'.

These products are unsafe. They are a potential choking hazard to any child less than 3 years of age. How teeth grow Your child's first two teeth usually come through on the bottom gum. Thumb-sucking Sucking their thumb soothes some small children. Some young children develop this habit around 18 months old and will stop it by four years old. Thumb-sucking is only a problem if it continues beyond this age. This is because the sucking may affect the shape of the permanent front teeth. It is also important that you regularly wash your child's hands. Regular hand washing can help stop infections transferring from their hands to their mouths. Ask your dentist, GP , GP practice nurse or public health nurse for more advice about caring for your child's teeth.151 151 Your baby's social and emotional world Your baby's social and emotional world The relationship between you and your child in the early years of their life provides the foundation for good health and well-being throughout the rest of their life. How your baby develops as a person You are building a bond with your baby from the moment they are born. The way you hold your baby closely, make eye contact, speak with them, touch and comfort them are all part of building this loving and trusting relationship. Responsive parenting Your child's social, emotional and behavioural development is influenced by the way you listen and respond to them and by the way they respond to you. From an early age, you are starting to learn and identify your baby's cues around tiredness, hunger and possible pains. It is important to tune into these cues as they will help you to get to know your baby.

Every baby is special and unique and has their own personality. You will get to know from your baby's cues what touches, sounds and environments they enjoy. Feeling safe helps them to be confident As your child grows, it is important that you provide a safe, secure and nurturing environment for them to develop. They will at first be dependent on you, and become gradually more independent. As a parent, it is important to know what to expect as your child grows so that you can support and help them to grow to be confident, happy and secure. Milestones for your baby's social and emotional development Baby's age Your baby may 1 to 2 months respond to your voice cry, smile and coo look at faces quieten when picked up (most of the time) 3 to 4 months give warm smiles and laughs cry when upset and seek comfort show excitement by waving arms and legs 5 to 6 months be friendly with strangers, but may show slight anxiety when you or another trusted adult is out of sight know and respond to familiar faces 6 to 9 months begin to show fear of things that did not bother them before this, such as heights or going for a bath get very attached to you and upset if you go away, for example when you leave them at your child-minder or with your baby sitter 9 to 12 months seek your attention and cry to get it become shy around other less familiar faces and be attached to you feel secure in their close relationship with you and trust that their needs will be met by you show feelings of happiness by laughing, show feelings of anger by screaming and show feelings of hurt by crying be able to recognise these ranges of feelings in others, for example, they may get upset easily if they see and hear another small child crying153 153 Your baby's social and emotional world Milestones for your toddler Toddler's age: Y our toddler may: 12 to 15 months be easily frightened and cry if they are startled by a sound such as a door banging look for your attention and approval but not always do what you say have developed a safe and secure relationship with you react to changes in their daily routine be able to soothe and comfort themselves, for example, by sucking their thumb, as well as sometimes needing comfort from you 15 to 18 months enjoy and thrive on getting your personal attention and praise get upset when they do not get something they want be unwilling to share toys with other children 18 to 24 months like to have their own way by testing the limits have tantrums when they do not get their own way become less frightened than they were of things such as heights or people who they do not really know learn to deal with short separations from you not want to go to bed at bedtime not like it if you are cross with them and they may cry show resentment of any attention you give to other small children develop a sense of themselves such as recognising their own face in a mirror Tips to help your baby to feel safe and secure Respond to your baby when they are unsettled or crying - this isn't 'spoiling' them and helps them to become calm. Cuddle, touch, sing and talk to your baby. Smile at your baby as you hold them close to you. Take time to make eye contact with your baby - for example, when you are feeding them.

Tell your child that you love them. Give them time Make time to play, chat and listen to your child - this lets them know that they are important. Toddlers need to play on their own and with others - they will learn many life skills such as winning and losing, having fun and chatting to others. Build their confidence and self-esteem Talk about your child in a positive way. Allow them, where possible, to make choices and decisions. For example: \"Do you want to wear your blue coat or your yellow coat?\" This can help avoid arguments and helps develop their independence. Encourage them to be as independent as possible, for example by learning to dress or feeding themselves. Respect your child All children deserve to be treated with courtesy and dignity, just like adults - your child learns respect from what you do. For example, suppose you correct your toddler for misbehaviour. Later, you find out that you were wrong. You can show them the appropriate way to behave by saying that you were wrong and you are sorry. Try to understand your child's feelings We show our emotions in the tone of our voices and the looks on our faces. You can help your child understand their feelings and show yours by smiling back at your child when they smile at you. Or put on a sad face and speak to them in a sad tone of voice while you wash and bandage their sore finger. This shows them you feel for them and want to help and comfort them.155 155 Your baby's social and emotional world Guiding your child's behaviour As a parent, you want to able to teach your child about the types of behaviour that are acceptable for their age. Encourage positive behaviour by setting clear rules and boundaries. Give your child lots of positive attention when they behave well. Be consistent Children thrive in a loving, low-conflict, safe and predictable environment. Give your child the opportunity to be more independent and to make decisions for themselves. Although they may make mistakes, this is part of learning. By encouraging positive behaviours you are supporting your child to: be confident get on well with their family and other children learn new skills and behaviours become more independent over time, solve problems and be able to do more things for themselves as they grow The following tips can help: Notice and praise good behaviour Praise good behaviour as soon as you see it. Children will appreciate this attention and repeat the behaviour so that they can get more attention. Highlight the specific behaviour you want to see more of. For example: \"Thanks for putting your dirty clothes in the basket, I really like the way you put them in the basket.\" That way they will know what you are praising them for and will be more likely to repeat it. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie156 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour baby's social and emotional world 156Have clear rules and boundaries They need to be short, easy to understand, fair and apply to all in the home. Use positive instead of negative words - for example say \"do speak quietly\" instead of \"don't shout\". Be consistent so children get to know these rules. Model good behaviour You are your child's role model and they are likely to copy what you do - if you act calmly and respectfully it can encourage your child to do the same. If your toddler misbehaves It is normal for toddlers to test boundaries and limits. It is important to think ahead to how you will manage this behaviour when it happens. Stay as calm as you can and try not to get upset or angry. Remember that this is all part of your child's normal growth and development. They are learning from your reaction to their misbehaviour. There are different ways of dealing with this. Here are some options that might work for you and your child. Anticipate problems If you know you are going to be waiting somewhere for a period of time, think of activities you and your child can do together to keep them occupied. Tantrums are more likely to occur when your child is hungry or tired and having healthy snacks to hand is often a good idea. Try not to plan activities during nap-time or close to bedtime. Keep to a routine Children feel secure if things happen at roughly the same time each day. If you need to change anything, explain why.157 157 Your baby's social and emotional world Consider doing nothing You could ignore the misbehaviour if it is minor, once your toddler or others are not being put at risk. Toddlers love attention. Generally if they don't get attention when they do something, they will stop. Taking action However, you may need to act if the misbehaviour is more serious. This is particularly important if you feel it could cause harm to themselves or others. It is important to let your toddler know that certain behaviours are unacceptable and that you will take action. Remove the child You could remove your toddler from where they are misbehaving, explain that this behaviour is not acceptable and why it is not acceptable. Only allow your toddler to return to the activity when they have calmed down. Change the game If children are fighting over a toy or activity, you can remove that toy or activity for a short period of time. Explain that you expect them to play nicely and you will return the toy or allow them back to the activity when they calm down. When you return the toy or to the activity explain the rules again. If the fighting happens again, take away the toy or activity for a longer period. Follow through You will need to act quickly, have a plan in place and be consistent. If you don't follow through with what you said your child quickly learns this. They will be less likely to stop the misbehaviour. Make it clear that the misbehaviour is wrong and not your child, as this may affect their self-esteem. For example, instead of saying \"you are a naughty boy, why can't you be good?\" you could say \"James, pushing Andrea is not nice. It can hurt.\" Encourage your toddler to wait for their turn. Have a plan Plan ahead. It is always best to deal with issues, like tiredness or hunger that might cause your child to be upset or misbehave. For example, if shopping time is clashing with naptime, wait until after naptime to go shopping. If you go shopping with a child who is tired, they are more likely to have a tantrum. Tantrums Tantrums are very common and tend to begin around the age of 15 months. A tantrum is sometimes your growing child's only way of expressing their big feelings. During a tantrum During a tantrum, your child may do things like shout, scream, kick, bite, throw themselves to the floor or throw things about. Tantrums tend to become less frequent by the time your child reaches the age of 3. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie158 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour baby's social and emotional world 158Tantrums can help Believe it or not tantrums can be a positive thing. They are an opportunity to teach your child how to manage frustration and anger. Being able to deal with challenges and with big feelings like anger and to express them in appropriate ways are really important life skills. Try to stay calm Not all children have tantrums, and for some they may only occur occasionally. For other children tantrums are more frequent. It can be stressful for parents to see their child having a tantrum. Being in public adds an extra element of stress. You may feel embarrassed when your child has a tantrum in public. When you feel embarrassed, it is harder to remain calm. There are some things you can do to help you to deal with tantrums when they happen. Managing tantrums It can be very difficult to stay calm when your child is having a tantrum. You may not realise it, but even when they are having a tantrum your child is watching you to see how you react. When you stay calm, you are modelling the behaviour you would like them to copy. Your calmness will help your child to feel safe. Think about why the tantrum is happening By having a tantrum your toddler is expressing what they are feeling. Perhaps they are hungry or tired. Perhaps they do not want to share a toy with another child. Perhaps they are feeling jealous. Understanding why the tantrum is happening can help you to deal with it. After all, we all feel angry and frustrated at times, we just express it differently. Prevention You can sometimes help prevent tantrums by avoiding your child becoming too hungry or tired. Keep shopping trips short. 159 159 Your baby's social and emotional world Saying \"no\" When you say \"no\", say it firmly and calmly and offer your child another option. For example, encourage other good aspects of their behaviour, such as getting them to join in play with you and others. Remember, it is the tone of your voice and their understanding of the word \"no\" that is important to learn at an early age. Be consistent Don't change your mind just because your child is having a tantrum. If the tantrum has happened because you have said \"no\" to something, do not say \"yes\" no matter how tempted you may be. This might resolve this tantrum, but soon your toddler will realise that tantrums result in them getting what they want. Wait it out Sometimes there is nothing you can do other than wait for the tantrum to pass. This can feel like a very long time, especially in public. Try not to feel embarrassed. Ignore other people who may be around, and focus on remaining calm. People with small children themselves are likely to be very sympathetic, it could be their child next! Keep your child close If possible hug and reassure your child, talk out what you think may be going on in their head. For example: \"I know you're angry that you can't have sweets...\" Some children will not want to be hugged or touched during a tantrum. Stay with your child to make sure they do not come to physical harm. Don't try to reason with your child until they calm down Your young child is too upset to listen to or understand what you are saying. They won't be open to logic. Look after yourself If you find yourself becoming angry or upset with your child's behaviour, see if you can get another adult to take over minding them while you take some time out. Biting, hitting, kicking and other unacceptable behaviours Most young children occasionally bite, hit and kick others. This might include other children or even a parent. It is normal for young children to test limits. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie160 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour baby's social and emotional world 160Strong feelings These behaviours can happen because your child needs to express a strong feeling such as anger. It may also be their way of telling you they need more personal space. Sometimes they are simply experimenting to see what will happen or what kind of a reaction they will get. Sometimes biting can happen if your child is teething and in pain. Teach them it's not okay As your child grows older, they should learn that these behaviours will hurt others. It is important that you teach your child that these behaviours are not acceptable. With time, you will notice when these behaviours are more likely to occur and you may be able to prevent them from happening. Ways to prevent unacceptable behaviours Keep an eye on your child, especially when they are around other children. Think about when these behaviours normally happen. Distract your child with an interesting book or toy if you see them about to bite, hit or kick. Provide your child with something they can chew on if you think they are in pain from teething. If you think your child bites, hits or kicks when they need personal space, keep an eye on the space around your child. For example: \"Jake would you mind sitting over here so Anna has a bit of space?\" Suggest ways to share and take turns - one idea is to use an egg timer so children can see how long they have to play with the toy before sharing. How to deal with unacceptable behaviours Be aware of your own feelings. Count to 10 or take a few deep breaths before you respond. If an older child is hitting their newborn baby brother or sister, it is normal for your protective instincts to make you want to react with anger. Try and react calmly and gently. Firmly but calmly state that the behaviour is wrong, for example: \"No biting. Biting hurts. Look Jake is crying now.\" Keep it short and simple. It is important to not give too much attention to the behaviour. Focus your attention on the child who has been hurt by showing concern and sympathy. By doing this, you are not giving attention to the child who has bitten, hit or kicked. Children love attention so by not giving them that attention you make the unacceptable behaviour seem unrewarding. It also shows empathy for the child who has been hurt.161 161 Your baby's social and emotional world If the other child tries to join in as you soothe the child who has been hurt, remind them to wait because their behaviour was unacceptable. Learning new skills takes time. You may have to respond consistently like this a number of times. Eventually your child will learn different ways of expressing themselves. Don't make children play again together unless they want to. It can help to think about activities that don't require sharing, like sand and water play. These may give the children a chance to relax. Separation anxiety From about seven months to the age of three, children can be clingy and can cry when separated from you. This is called separation anxiety. Nearly all children experience separation anxiety at some stage. For some it may last longer than others. Separation anxiety does not happen because you have \"spoiled\" your baby. It is a normal part of your child's development. A sign of attachment Separation anxiety is a sign that your child knows how important you are to them. It shows that they have a strong attachment to you. Your baby is also beginning to realise that they can communicate their needs and get a reaction. But they do not yet fully understand that when you leave them you will come back. Helping your child to cope Separation anxiety can be very upsetting for parents. But you can help your child to understand and cope with their feelings. With your help, your child will learn that they will be okay and that you will return. Leaving your child with another caregiver is not going to damage them. It actually teaches them how to cope without you. This helps them to become more independent. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie162 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieYour baby's social and emotional world 162How to manage separation anxiety Remember this will pass. Separation anxiety is completely normal. As your child gets older, they learn that you exist even when you are out of sight. Until that happens, don't let their separation anxiety stop them from having new experiences or spending time with friends. Don't let it stop you doing the things you need to do, like going to work or going shopping. Start with short separations in your own home. Leave your child with familiar people. If you are arranging new childcare, arrange a few visits to give your child the chance to get to know them while with you. Gradually build up the time your child spends with the new childcare providers. Let your child know what you will do together later as this gives them something to look forward to. For example: \"When I come back we are going to visit nanny's house.\" Leave something comforting with your child like a favourite toy. Make saying goodbye a positive time - smile and say goodbye in a confident and happy way. Don't let your child see that you are sad or worried. Never sneak away without saying goodbye. Saying goodbye teaches your child that when you leave, you will return. Know when to get help. Talk to your GP or public health nurse if your child: remains upset for a long time after you leave is very distressed has separation anxiety going on for a few weeks163 163 Your baby's social and emotional world Development of your child's sexuality When you hear the word \"sexuality\", you may think about sexual activity and contact. However, it is about much more than this. It is about how we develop physically and emotionally, how we express ourselves and how we form relationships with others. Positive messages The messages that children get from birth about the human body and intimacy will influence their future development, so it's important that you consider what you'd like those messages to be. In early childhood, the way you love and nurture your child physically and emotionally is so important. This nurturing care will help your child to love and accept themselves. Connection Children learn how to form healthy and connected relationships with those around them. These positive experiences will help them develop the values and skills necessary for forming supportive relationships throughout their lives. As soon as your child develops speech and understanding, it is important to start speaking to them in an age-appropriate way about their sexual development. Build on these early discussions as they get older. Babies and toddlers (from birth to 2 years) Babies and toddlers learn about relationships, sexuality and growing up through the love and care they get from you and their other care-givers. Fulfilling your baby's need for food, love and shelter increases their sense of safety. It also provides them with opportunities to safely explore through their senses - touch, sound, taste, sight and smell. All of this contributes to their healthy social and emotional development.

Provide lots of opportunities for your child to explore safely. Play and talk with your child. Your child experiences attachment. They know their parents and siblings and make strange with new people.Teach your child about relationships and love through: making eye contact with them smiling at them cuddling, kissing and hugging them telling them that you love them and that they are important Try to ensure that your child's carers share your approach and values. Your child engages in unselfconscious play with their genitals if nappies are off or in the bath. Baby boys may have erections.Babies often play with their genitals. It is a part of their normal exploration. There is no health reason to discourage them.If you feel you need to, it is best to gently distract rather than pull your child's hands away from their genitals. Name all the body parts including the bum, penis, scrotum and vulva when you bathe your child or change their nappy. This makes it normal to refer to these body parts and will help your child to communicate when older.165 165 Your baby's social and emotional world Screen time Screen time is the time your child spends in front of a screen. This includes watching programmes and videos and interacting with apps on tablets, phones or other devices. Devices like tablets and smartphones can be more interactive than traditional TV watching. There may be more advantages to children using interactive technology, for example, in how they learn to move their fingers and hands when touching a screen. However, we do not know enough yet about any benefits to your young child's learning and development. Avoid screen time under 18 months Children learn best from talking or playing with their parents. Screen time is not recommended for children under 18 months. Screen time could mean that your child is spending less time doing other important activities. These include playing, moving around, being active, resting, sleeping, watching and interacting with those around them. What's the harm? Too much screen time could increase your child's risk of: sleeping less and having sleep issues being overweight or obese having poorer language skills having poorer cognitive skills, for example, issues with their attention Evidence also suggests that having a TV on in the background can have negative impacts on your child's development. 6 to 18 months Try to avoid letting your child under the age of 18 months watch or interact with screens other than for video calls with family and friends. 18 to 24 months Set limits on their screen time - make sure they spend less than one hour every day in front of a screen. Choose high-quality programmes or apps - visit commonsensemedia.org which helps parents make smart media choices for children from 24 months and older.

Avoid programmes or apps that are very noisy or fast-paced, they are not ideal for younger children and could be too distracting or stimulating. Make mealtimes screen-free zones. Keep the hour before bedtime a screen-free zone. Avoid having screens in children's bedrooms, including TVs. Although many apps are advertised as educational, there is very little evidence to back up these claims for young children. How to avoid problems with screen time Turn off screens in the background when they are not in use as they can still distract babies when they are resting or playing. Turn off devices during family times such as meal times. Avoid screens for at least 1 hour before bed time as they can impact on sleep. Try not to regularly use screens to calm or distract your child. Using screens like this may mean that your child will find it harder to calm themselves as they get older. Try a toy or an activity Screen time can be tempting when you are busy and unable to play with your child. Instead, set them up safely in the same room you are in and give them an appropriate toy or activity to occupy them. Include the rest of the family It is important to be aware of your family's screen time in the presence of your baby. This is because screen time might get in the way of time spent in activities which are key to building a relationship with your baby. These activities include: making eye contact with them touching and holding them interacting with them responding to their needs Children also like to copy what they see others do. If they see you spending a lot of time using a smartphone, they will want to do it too. Use your judgment. Be mindful of your child's exposure to screen time, and make sure screen time does not get in the way of fun childhood activities. 167 167 Playing and learning Playing and learning Play is a very important part of your child's life. From the moment they are born, they are learning about themselves and the world around them. Play is how your child's thinking, feeling, doing and learning can develop within a safe and secure relationship with you. Their favourite playmate As a parent, you are your child's first and favourite playmate. From the earliest weeks and months, spending time playing with them sends an important message to your baby: you are loved, important and fun to be around.

Fantasy play Children develop flexible thinking. They learn to create beyond the here and now and stretch their imaginations in a risk-free environment. Provide lots of 'props', for example a whisk and bowl for a 'baker' or a big 'cardboard box' for 'guarding the treasure.' Dress up costumes - bought or homemade - also spark a child's imagination. Games with rulesTeaches children about fairness. This will help them to learn how to interact with other children. Start with games with few and simple 'rules' for example, Simple Simon Says or Duck Duck Goose. Very young children won't have the same level of self-regulation as older children. Accept that 'rules will be broken' but that's not a reason to not play. How your child learns and develops through play Children's play changes as they grow. Learning and development happens in many ways as your child grows and expresses how they feel and what they want. Whether it's rough-and-tumble physical, or quiet-and-reflective, all types of play help develop particular skills. Your child loves playing with you. This helps them feel accepted and understood. Important brain connections develop as your child plays with you. This sets a strong foundation for learning, developing language and life-long positive mental health. What your child learns from play Development area What your child learns to do Physical During their first year, they use their whole body and their five senses to play and learn. As they become more mobile, they stretch and grasp things by using their eye and hand movements together, and balance as they move. This movement includes going up and down, pushing and pulling, moving in and out and playing hide and seek.171 171 Playing and learningDevelopment area What your child learns to do Intellectual They begin to test out their developing skills of thinking, reasoning and memory. For example, they explore a soft toy as they play with it to discover what will happen if they squeeze it, taste it or drop it. Emotional and behaviouralThey express their feelings by laughing, smiling and crying. They use play to express themselves. For example, during 'peek-a-boo' they are interacting with you and learning that you are there even when they cannot see your face. They respond to the warmth of your praise and your cuddles. Social They play with you and others, as well as play happily on their own while you are near. Encourage your child to mix with other children by visiting a parent and baby or toddler group. Learning through the senses You can help your child to develop, learn and grow by stimulating their senses. Everyday play provides the perfect opportunity to explore themselves, you and the world around them. If your child has difficulty using one of their senses, such as hearing or sight, their other senses help them continue to learn and develop through play.

But they have no concept of safety or danger. So while your child is busy exploring, they rely on you make sure that their home is a safe place. A safe place to play Children don't see danger Never underestimate your child's ability and speed. Young children move very quickly. In the blink of an eye they can move from where you last saw them. The key to child safety is constant adult supervision. In other words, watch your baby and toddler at all times as children do not understand danger. ! The basics of child safety Have a well-stocked first aid kit and learn basic first aid skills. Childproof your home inside and out. Put safety measures in place before your child reaches their next developmental stage and age. Install child safety equipment to help keep your child safe. Share essential safety information with everyone who takes care of your child. This includes grandparents, relatives and babysitters. Lead by example - from the earliest age children learn from what we do, so act safely at all times when with them. Talk to your child about safety. Remember that young children do not understand danger and are not capable of being responsible for their own safety.

Store it out of sight and reach of your children. Do not store medicines in the first aid kit. Store them separately in a locked high cupboard. Your public health nurse will give you a HSE child safety wall chart. It includes some basic first aid steps for common injuries. Learn these steps but get medical attention if in any doubt. Be prepared The Irish Red Cross has an app with easy-to-follow tips for more than 20 common first aid scenarios. It also has advice about how to prepare for emergencies, including floods, fires and water safety. See redcross.ie If you get a chance, complete a first aid course. For information you can contact the Order of Malta, The Irish Red Cross or St John's Ambulance. Your public health nurse may also know of first aid courses being run in your area.

See eircode.ie185 185 Keeping your child safeChildproofing your home Childproofing your home is one of the most valuable actions you can take to help keep your children safe. It helps you spot potential dangers so that you can take action to fix them. The best way to childproof your home is to: Get down on your knees to your child's height. Look at every area of your home inside and outside through their eyes. Ask yourself: \"Is there anything here that could be a danger to my child?\" Remove the dangers once you have identified them. Small objects Remember that babies have a natural tendency to put things into their mouth. Be alert to this when you are childproofing and remove any small objects that could get into your baby's reach. Checklist Your public health nurse will give you a child safety checklist. Use this to guide you. Aim to have every box ticked and a plan to fix anything you have not ticked. Keep updating Childproofing is not a once-off activity. You need to repeat it regularly as your child becomes more mobile and learns new skills. As your child gets older, you will also need to check for dangers that they can climb to.

Most of these are minor, but some can be more serious. Here are some things you can do to try to prevent injuries and accidents. Did you know? Most unintentional injuries (accidents) to children under 5 years of age happen in their own home. The good news is that with a little planning you can prevent most of these injuries. Falls Raised surfaces Falls from raised surfaces can cause serious injuries. Never leave your child alone on a baby changer or raised surface. Don't leave a baby bouncer or any other sitting device on raised surfaces, as your child could topple over. Stairs Keep steps and staircases clear. Install stair gates correctly and keep them closed. Use stair gates at top and bottom of stairs. Also use them in areas that pose a trip hazard, like steps at doorways or changes in floor level. Remove the stair gates once your child is able to climb over them. Show your child how to slowly and safely climb and go down the stairs.

Free-standing furniture Bookcases, TV stands, chests of drawers, coat stands and other free-standing equipment and furniture can cause serious or fatal injury. This can happen if the item or its contents falls onto your child. Always secure these items to the wall or floor using brackets or straps. Make sure items such as kitchen units, dressers, mirrors, fireplaces and mantelpieces are correctly secured to the wall. TV stands and cabinets Do not put TVs on cabinets or chests of drawers as children often climb into drawers to reach them. Always secure TVs, stands and cabinets to the wall or floor with brackets or straps to prevent tip-over incidents. Windows Secure all windows with restrictors that do not need tools for opening (so you can escape in case of fire). Where possible, do not place beds, cots, or other furniture near a window. Do not place toy boxes near a window. Balconies Make sure your child can't get out onto a balcony without your supervision. Secure balcony doors and fill in any gaps in balcony railings that a child could fit through or use to climb. Do not place anything children could climb on (like outdoor furniture, plant pots or boxes) near balcony railings. Floors Running in socks on a shiny or wooden floor can lead to a nasty fall. Encourage your child to wear well-fitting slippers or go barefoot inside the home. 189 189 Keeping your child safeOther hazards Make sure: walls are finished correctly gates are in good working order there are no ladders, equipment or items lying around that your child could climb onto Don't use baby walkersBaby walkers increase the risk of head injuries, burns, scalds and poisoning. Stationary activity centres and play pens can provide a safer alternative. These should only be used for short periods and always under supervision. Children who are not yet walking should spend time on the floor while you supervise. Crawling, shuffling and pulling themselves up supports their motor development. Motor development is how your child learns to use their muscles to make movements. Fire Smoke alarms Have working smoke alarms in the hall and landing and aim to have one in every room. Test regularly (once a week is advised) and replace wasted batteries immediately. Make a fire escape plan and practice it often. Fireguards and sparkguards Use a fireguard and a sparkguard on open fires. Stoves and heaters should be protected by a fireguard. Fireguards should be secured to a wall. Never place anything on a fireguard.

Make your home a smoke- free zone. Candles Never leave a lit candle unattended or move it while lit. Position candles away from curtains, draughts and breezes and always out of reach of your child. Chip pans Traditional stove-top chip pans are a fire risk. Consider a different method of cooking, for example, using an electrical deep fat fryer. Sockets Never overload sockets. Switch off and unplug electrical equipment when not in use. Burns and scalds It only takes a tiny amount of hot liquid to cause devastating injuries to babies and young children. Hot water Run cold water first, then warm water. Always test bath water with elbow or bath thermometer before putting your child in the bath. If your bath has a single tap with a hot and cold feed, make sure you run the cold water again to cool the taps so they won't burn your baby. The temperature should be about 36\u00b0C for newborns. It should be 37\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C for babies and children. Never ever leave your child alone in the bath. See page 88 for more information on bathing your baby. Hot drinks and foods Keep hot drinks out of your child's reach or grasp. Hot drinks, even with milk added, are still hot enough to seriously scald your child up to 15 minutes after being poured. Never drink or make hot drinks while holding your child and never cook while holding your child. Avoid using tablecloths as your child may pull at them. Use kettles with a short flex and keep them out of your child's reach. Always cook on back rings first, with handle turned in. Use a cooker guard for protection. 191 191 Keeping your child safeHot bottles and solids If bottle-feeding, make sure bottle contents are lukewarm and not hot. Check the temperature by shaking the bottle and placing a drop of liquid on the inside of your wrist. When your child starts eating solids, test food temperature before serving. See page 59 for more information on weaning. Did you know? Hair straighteners can reach 200\u00b0C and higher - hot enough to fry an egg. They take up to 40 minutes to cool down. Most injuries happen after you have used the straighteners. It is important to switch them off and unplug them straight away after use. Store them immediately in a heat-resistant bag and out of reach of children. Choking Children under 3 are at the highest risk of choking because of the small size of their respiratory tract (airways). Keep small and unsuitable items out of reach. Be aware that older children may try to share unsuitable objects or food with younger children. Food preparation Make sure that food consistency is suitable for your baby's age and developmental stage. Always cut up food to a size that your child can chew and eat safely. For example: Cut grapes, cherry tomatoes and similar food into quarters lengthways or smaller. Carrot, apple and celery can be cooked until soft or else finely grated. Remove or peel skins from sausages or hotdogs and cut lengthways into small pieces (at least as small as your child's small fingernail). Use thick pastes like nut butter or chocolate spread very sparingly and spread evenly and thinly onto bread. Do not give any child under 5 years of age popcorn, marshmallows, boiled (hard) sweets, chewing gum or nuts.

Make sure your child sits in a high chair or at the table and is always closely supervised by an adult. This also gives lots of opportunities for time to talk with your child. Food choking risks Bottles If bottle-feeding, always hold your baby in your arms and hold the bottle in your hand. Never prop or lean the bottle against a pillow or another support - this can cause your baby to choke. Toys Use the right toy for your child's age and developmental stage to reduce the risk of choking on toys or bits of toys. Be mindful of older children sharing unsuitable toys with your child. Always look for the CE mark on toys or their packaging. This shows that they meet the required safety standards. Throw away broken toys. Watch out for older children sharing unsuitable toys with younger ones. See page 181 for more information on toys. Balloons Balloons are not toys. Only adults should inflate them and children should be supervised around them. Batteries Keep all remote controls and spare or used batteries in a secure place. Make sure all battery compartments on toys and other items are secure and can't be opened by little hands. Be extra careful with things that don't have locked battery compartments. These include some musical greeting cards, flameless candles and remote controls. 193 193 Keeping your child safeBeware of button batteries Button batteries are small circular- shaped batteries. They are found in some toys, musical greeting cards, calculators and small electronic devices. Your child may not choke after swallowing a button battery. But if undetected it can seriously burn their insides. If you think your child has swallowed one, go to hospital immediately. Foreign bodies Your child could get an item stuck in their eyes, ears and nose. Signs may include: redness irritation pain bleeding discharge foul odour Never try to remove objects that are stuck in your child's ears, eyes or nose as this could cause them serious injury. Always seek medical advice from your GP or the nearest hospital emergency department that treats children. An object stuck in the nose could cause breathing difficulties or choking if it is breathed in. If your child begins to experience breathing difficulties, go to your nearest emergency department.

Blinds and curtains Do not fit blinds or curtains with cords attached. Replace existing cords with curtain or blind wands. Prevent eye injury by keeping wands out of reach of your baby. Cord tie-down or tension devices (see picture) pull the cord tight and secure it to the wall or floor. They help prevent strangulation risk from continuous loop cords on vertical blinds. Clothing and jewellery Your child is at risk from anything placed on or caught around their neck. Never place any of the following on your baby or toddler: hair bands jewellery (including amber teething jewellery) strings cords belts ribbons clips ties clothes and hats with strings or cords Always remove your child's bib after feeding. Don't allow your children to play with string, cords, ropes or jewellery. Wires and flexes Keep electrical flexes, including phone chargers, out of reach. Fixtures, fittings and furniture Beware of the risk of getting trapped or strangled posed by banisters, railings, old cots and other furniture with gaps.195 195 Keeping your child safeSuffocation Plastic bags and packaging, including nappy sacks Plastic material can cling to your child's face and cause suffocation. Store plastic bags, plastic nappy sacks and bags, dry-cleaning and other plastic packaging out of reach of children. Safe sleep Always keep your baby's cot clear. Never place pillows, duvets, bumpers, sleep positioners, wedges, bedding rolls, toys or comfort blankets into it. Use cellular aerated blankets which allow air to circulate. See page 202 for more advice about safe sleep for your baby. Make sure the mattress in your baby's cot and pram is firm and flat. It must fit correctly with no gaps or spaces between it and the edges of the cot or pram. Sitting devices Sleeping in a sitting position can cause your child's head to fall forward. This can make it difficult for them to breathe. Never use a sitting device (like bouncers, highchairs, buggies, swings and car seats) for your child's routine sleep. If they fall asleep in one, remove them and place on their back to sleep as soon as possible. Long car journeys If going on a long car journey with your baby, plan for breaks where you can safely park your car. Then take your baby out of the car seat and place them on their back, either on your lap or in the back seat, while you supervise closely. Return your baby safely to their car seat before you start driving again. Slings When using a sling, baby carrier or baby-wearing coat, make sure your child is upright, their head is supported and they don't get too hot. If your child falls asleep, remove them as soon as possible and place on their back on a flat surface. See page 88 for more sling safety information.

Even a tiny amount of water is dangerous. Drowning can happen in silence, in an instant and in a very small amount of water like a puddle or a basin of water. Children who survive near-drowning frequently have long-term health effects from brain injury. Watch your child at all times as children can stray very quickly and crawl, walk or fall into water. Always make sure your child is within your sight and arm's reach. Bath-time Never leave your child alone at bath-time. If you need to leave, bring them with you. Don't ask an older child to supervise instead. Avoid using bath seats. They are not safety equipment. Drowning is a potential danger as your child could slip out of the seat or tip forward or sideways into the water and become completely covered in the bath water. Always empty bathwater immediately after use. See page 88 for information on bathing your baby safely. Ponds and water containers Empty mop bucket, basins, paddling pools and other water containers after use. Store them safely. Use toilet latches. Look out for and remove containers that could fill with rain water. Use protective covers for garden ponds and fence off open water areas. Toddlers are most at risk near garden ponds. Keep front and back doors closed and locked at all times. The keys should be out of sight and reach of children, but near the door for fire safety purposes.! 197 197 Keeping your child safePools Be very vigilant if your child is near a swimming pool, for example on holiday. Make sure there is a locked gate or door separating your child from the pool. You need to make sure your child is properly supervised. Lifeguards do not replace the need for parental supervision. Swimming aids Only use arm bands and other buoyancy aids that have an approved safety standard mark (I.S. EN 13138 and the CE mark). They must fit properly. These aids do not replace the need for constant adult supervision. Poison Detergents and cleaning products Always keep household products in their original child-resistant containers. Be aware that child-resistant containers are not child-proof. Store chemicals, household cleaning and laundry products, including laundry and dishwater tablets, capsules and pods in high cupboards. Use cupboard safety locks. Never use water or soft drink bottles to store detergents, cleaning products, garden and DIY products or any other chemicals. ! Garden and DIY products Keep garden and DIY products in original containers and out of reach, preferably in a locked shed. Dispose of old and unused chemicals and products safely. Plants Remove any poisonous plants indoors and outdoors. Get advice from your garden centre when buying plants to make sure they are not a danger to your child. E-cigarettes Do not leave electronic cigarettes or their refills in reach or sight of children. These products contain nicotine. It is highly toxic when swallowed or inhaled by children. You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie198 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieKeeping your child safe198Alcohol and cigarettes Lock alcohol and cigarettes away out of sight and reach. Even small amounts of alcohol can be harmful to children. Cigarette butts have enough nicotine in them to be toxic to babies. Syringes and needles Keep needles and syringes locked away. Dispose of them safely immediately after use. Carbon monoxide Use carbon monoxide alarms (EN 50291 standard) in every room with fuel-burning appliances. Medicine and supplements Keep all medicines, iron and vitamin tablets or supplements in their original containers. Lock them in an overhead medicine cabinet or high cupboard. This includes 'gummy bear'-type supplements given to older children. Iron is very dangerous for young children if taken in a high dose. Don't use the word 'sweets' when talking about medicines or vitamins. Try to not to take your own medication in front of your children because children love to copy what grown-ups do. Follow instructions on medicine labels carefully. Return old and unused medicines to your pharmacist. Handbag items Handbags can contain items like tablets, chewing gum, hand gel, cosmetics and perfume. Place all handbags out of your baby's reach. Public Poisons Line If you think that your child has taken poison, stay calm but act quickly. Contact the Public Poisons Information Helpline by ringing (01) 809 2166. Save this number to your phone. Your call will be answered by a specialist who will tell you if medical attention is needed. The helpline is open every day from 8am to 10pm. See poisons.ie Outside of these hours, contact your GP or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 or 112. 199 199 Keeping your child safeOther dangers in the home Sharp objects Always keep sharp objects - such as scissors, knives and pen knives - out of your child's reach and sight. Electrical equipment At all times keep the doors closed on your dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, fridge and other similar electrical equipment. Use safety locks. Sun If your child's skin is exposed to too much sun, it may increase their risk of skin cancer later in life. It can also cause their delicate skin to become sunburnt. This is painful, itchy and very uncomfortable. Did you know? Up to 90% of UV rays can pass through light clouds - so you need to take care on cloudy days too. Windows Windows in your car, home and office block most UVB rays but UVA rays can penetrate glass. UVA rays can cause sun damage to the skin, leading to ageing and potentially skin cancer. For car journeys, use clothing and sunscreen that has a high SPF as well as UVA protection to protect your child's skin. Consider using window shades in your car to shade your child from the sun. Make sure they have no small or detachable parts that a young child could get hold of. Seek shade Keep your child out of direct sunlight, especially between 11am to 3pm. Keep babies under 6 months in the shade as much as possible. Use a sunshade on your buggy or pram. Cover up Dress your child in loose-fitting, long- sleeved and light protective clothing. These should be made from close-woven fabric that doesn't let sunlight through. Use a wide brim sunhat that protects the face, neck and ears.

Make sure they give as close to 100% UV-protection as possible. Wraparound style offers the best protection. Use sunscreen Choose a UVA and UVB sunscreen made for children and babies with at least SPF 30. Patch test it on their skin first - try sunscreen for sensitive skin if their skin is irritated. For best protection, apply sunscreen at least 20 minutes before going out in the sun. Cover all exposed areas especially the face, ears, nose, lips and tops of the feet. 0 to 6 months Keep your baby as covered up as possible. Apply small amounts of sunscreen to your baby's exposed skin. 6 to 24 months Apply generous amounts of sunscreen and reapply at least every 2 hours. Keep hydratedMake sure your child drinks enough fluids and does not overheat. They cannot adjust to changes in temperature as well as adults. They sweat less, reducing their body's ability to cool down. Vitamin D See pages 56 and 69. Facts about tanning A tan does not protect skin from burning. A tan is the skin's way of trying to protect itself from further UV damage. Even when a tan fades, skin damage caused by tanning never goes away. Getting sunburnt in childhood or adolescence can increase the risk of melanoma in later life. This is the most serious form of skin cancer. Pets Never leave your baby or young child alone with a dog, cat or any pet. This is very important whether your baby is awake or sleeping and no matter how well you know the animal. Introduce your baby slowly to your pet. Existing pets, especially dogs, can be very jealous of a new baby. 201 201 Keeping your child safeKeep all food and water bowls, litter trays and pet toys out of your child's reach. Model safe behaviour and teach your child how to: play safely with pets avoid dangerous situations respond to danger signs wash their hands carefully after all contact with pets and other animals Bites, scratches and wounds If your child is bitten or scratched, wash the wound immediately and use disinfectant cream or solution. Always contact your GP if you are worried about a wound or if a wound is not healing properly. Choosing a pet Choose a pet that suits your family's lifestyle, home and outdoor space. Snakes, turtles, tortoises and lizards are not suitable for homes with children under age 5. They carry a range of germs that could make your baby very ill or even cause death. Certain breeds of dogs and any dog with behavioural problems require an additional level of care, control and supervision. Consider carefully if such animals are suitable for your family.

It is the sudden and unexpected death of a seemingly healthy baby during sleep. Cot death does not happen only in a cot - it can happen anywhere a baby is sleeping.Research has shown that you can take steps to reduce the risk of cot death. Share these key points with everyone who looks after your baby: Put your baby on their back to sleep Always place your baby on their back to sleep. This is the same during the day and during the night. Babies who sleep on their tummies have a higher risk of cot death. Putting your baby to sleep on their back does not increase the risk of choking or vomiting. But placing your baby to sleep on their tummy or on their side does. This is because any vomit will pool at the opening of the trachea (windpipe), making it easier for them to choke.! Make sure everyone who looks after your baby puts them to sleep on their back. Let your baby have some time on their tummy, when they are awake and while you supervise. It is important to begin tummy time from birth. See page 129. A smoke-free zone Create a smoke-free zone for your baby. Do not smoke during pregnancy. Don't let anyone smoke in your home, car or around your baby. A safe sleep environment For the first 6 months, the safest place for your baby to sleep is on their back in a cot, crib or Moses basket in the same room as you. Bed sharing or co-sleeping in the same bed can be dangerous. It can increase your baby's risk of suffocation and overheating. Do not share a bed with your baby if you or your partner: are smokers have taken alcohol, drugs (legal or illegal) or medication that may make you drowsy are over tired203 203 Keeping your child safeBed-sharing is not recommended if your baby: is less than 3 months old was premature (born before 37 weeks) had a low birth weight - less than 2.5kg (kilograms) or 5.5lbs (pounds) Face up and face-free Keep your baby's face and head uncovered while asleep. This means no hats, hair bands, clothes or covers near their face. Hair bands can slip over your baby's face and cause suffocation. Keep covers tucked under your baby's shoulders. Feet to the foot of the cot Place your baby with their feet to the foot of the cot. Keep the cot clear Keep the cot free of soft objects and anything loose or fluffy that could smother your child. These include: Do not use sleep positioners and similar products They are not necessary and are a suffocation risk. Sleep positioners and similar products do not prevent plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) or cot death. A cot in good condition Make sure the cot is in good condition and properly assembled. The mattress should be clean, firm, flat with no tears and fit the cot correctly. Make sure your baby does not get too hot when asleep The room should be between 16\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. Don't use too many covers or clothes. It is normal for your baby's hands and feet to feel cool. Your baby should not wear a hat when being put down to sleep. Babies lose heat through their head. If you cover your baby's head, they may become overheated. Hats Your baby should not go to sleep wearing a hat unless you are advised to do so by your doctor or midwife. Hats are used to keep a baby's temperature stable immediately after birth. They are not needed for sleep after that. pillows and cushions duvets toys bumpers wedges bedding rolls You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie204 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieKeeping your child safe204Soothers and dummies Giving your baby a soother when they are being put down to sleep may reduce the risk of cot death. Wait until breastfeeding is well-established before introducing a soother (see page 35). Never force a soother if your baby does not like it. Offer your baby their soother every time they are going to sleep. Do not attach clips, strings, ribbons or chains to soothers. These are a choking and strangulation risk. Breastfeeding Breastfeed your baby, if possible. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of cot death, so aim to breastfeed for as long as you can. If feeding in bed, always remember to return your baby to their own cot for sleep. Get medical advice early and quickly if: your baby seems unwell you find it hard to tell if the illness is something minor or more serious See page 105 for advice on when to contact your GP or get an ambulance. If it's an emergency, dial 999 or 112. Cot death is still quite rare. While it is important to take all the necessary precautions, do not let fear spoil precious times with your baby. The safe sleep advice above is intended for babies under 12 months who are well. For babies with specific health needs, extra advice may be given by your healthcare professional.Sitting devices Car seats, swings, infant seats, slings, carriers and similar sitting devices are not recommended for routine sleep in the home. Sleeping in a sitting position can cause your baby's head to fall forward and make it difficult for them to breathe. If your baby falls asleep in a sitting device, they should be placed on their back to sleep as soon as is possible. Never leave your baby unsupervised while in a sitting device, whether in the car, home or elsewhere. 205 205 Keeping your child safeCar seats By law, all children under 150cms and 36kgs must use a car seat appropriate to their height and weight. Child car seats must conform to EU standards. Never use a second-hand car seat unless you are sure of its safety history. In Ireland, 4 out of 5 car seats are not properly fitted, which can lead to serious injury or even death in a crash. Get expert help when fitting your car seat. The Road Safety Authority offers a free 'check it fits' service - see rsa.ie Make sure your child is secured in a properly-fitted car seat for every journey, no matter how short. Rearward facing Keep your child rearward facing for as long as possible. This offers greater protection to their head, neck and spine. Rearward-facing baby seats are suitable for babies weighing less than 13kg. Extended rearward seats are suitable for children weighing 9 to 25kg. See rsa.ie for more information. Do not use the front seat if possible It is safer for children to travel in the back seat in their appropriate child car seat. Never place your child in a rearward facing car seat in the front passenger seat where there is an active frontal air bag. It is very dangerous and also illegal. The RSA advises: \"Think carefully about driving with a child in the front seat - even in the forward position. You must make sure that the passenger seat is rolled back as far away from the dashboard as possible\". Clothing and the harness Your child's clothing can affect how the child seat harness fits. Use blankets instead of bulky jackets in cooler weather. This makes sure the harness is making contact with your child's body. The harness should be tight enough so only two of your fingers can fit between the top of your child's shoulders and the harness straps. Your fingers should be unable to rotate (turn) in that position. Check this before every journey. Never leave your child in a parked car Never leave your child alone in a parked car, not even for a short time. Always remove your car keys from your car and keep your car locked. Keep your keys out of sight and reach of children.

Keep outside gates closed and locked. Make sure there are no gaps in the fences or wall surrounding your home. Remove objects near gates and walls that children could climb onto. Driveways Due to their small size, children are at risk from reversing vehicles as drivers may not see them. When vehicles are coming into or leaving your driveway, make sure your children are safely inside your home, or an adult is holding them securely in their arms or by the hand. External doors Keep all external doors locked. The keys should be out of sight and reach of children but near the door in case of a fire. Lawnmowers and strimmers Keep children away from lawnmowers, strimmers and other garden machinery. Don't try to mow the grass and supervise your child at the same time. Ask another adult to supervise your child away from where you are working. Ladders and equipment Make sure: there are no ladders, equipment or items lying around that your child could climb onto walls are finished correctly gates are in good working order 207 207 Keeping your child safePlay equipment Play time is very important and play equipment can help make it fun and exciting. To help keep your child safe: Safe clothing Make sure they don't wear jewellery or clothing with ties, strings or cords that could get caught in play equipment. Equipment safety Check the equipment: is suitable for your child's age and developmental stage has a recognised safety symbol such as the CE mark is in good condition and secured to the ground has no sharp edges or bits sticking out - both at home and in playground Installing equipmentMake sure you: properly assemble play equipment place it away from walls, trees, tree houses or hard surfaces, or near places where children might try to jump on or off assemble all play equipment according to manufacturer's instructions install all safety features Trampolines Make sure: trampolines have safety padding and safety nets children under 6 are not allowed on a trampoline only one person is on a trampoline at a time You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie208 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieKeeping your child safe208Child safety on the farm Working farms have many hidden dangers and children can stray very quickly. Never allow your child to play on the farm. Children are at high risk on the farm from vehicles, machinery, drowning, falls and animals. Teach your child that the farm is a workplace and dangerous. Be very vigilant also when children visit the farm. Fenced-off play area It is not possible to supervise your child safely and work on the farm at the same time. Provide your child with a safe and fenced-off play area, away from the working farm. Fencing and gates should have mesh right down to the ground. This is so that children cannot climb over or slip through gates or fences. Make sure the play area is in view of the home and your child is supervised. Poisons Keep all pesticides, cleaning fluids, chemicals, veterinary medicines and equipment in their original containers and in a securely locked store. Dispose of old and unused chemicals and farm products safely. Never use soft drinks bottles to store chemicals or medicines. Poisonous plants Remove any poisonous plants indoors and outdoors. Get advice when buying plants to make sure they are not a danger to your child. Public Poisons Line If you think that your child has been exposed to or taken poison, stay calm but act quickly. Phone the Public Poisons Information Helpline on 01 809 2166. It is open from 8am to 10pm every day. Outside of these hours, contact your GP or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 or 112. Animals Keep children at a safe distance from livestock and other animals. Drowning Use secure protective covers on barrels, troughs and tanks as appropriate. Store basins and buckets out of reach of children. Empty containers can fill quickly after rainfall. Fence off ponds and other water areas they might fall into. Slurry pits Securely cover or fence all slurry facilities.209 209 Keeping your child safeFalls Secure gates and doors. Heavy swinging gates or doors are very dangerous, especially in high winds. Never leave ladders, replacement gates, fencing or similar objects lying around. Children may be tempted to climb them. Discourage your child from playing with bales of any description. It is very easy for children to fall from stacked bales, resulting in serious injury. There is also a suffocation risk if they fall between bales or bales roll onto them. Prevent access to areas where there is potential to climb. For example, hay sheds, lofts, high loads, ladders, walls and gates. Vehicles Due to their size, children are at risk from reversing vehicles. When vehicles are in use or nearby, make sure your child is safely inside the home or an adult is holding them securely in their arms or by the hand. Never allow your child near tractors, farm vehicles or machinery. Never leave running vehicles or equipment unattended. Switch off and remove keys from all vehicles and equipment after use. Never allow your child to travel in tractors, farm vehicles or on quad bikes. Visitors Always make contractors aware of the presence of children.

Teach your child how to stay safe on the farm. But remember that young children do not understand danger and are not capable of being responsible for their own safety. Legal requirements The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires all farmers to prepare and implement a Safety Statement (farmers with three or fewer employees may instead follow the Code of Practice). Store guns safely and in keeping with the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009.211 211 Going back to work Going back to work If you work outside the home, you will need to make childcare and possibly breastfeeding arrangements. Returning to work after maternity leave can be difficult. Being organised in advance of your return will help make it easier. How to choose Deciding on childcare is a big decision for any parent. It is important to discuss your child's needs with the childcare service provider and to know what service they can provide. When choosing childcare for your child: Consider your child's individual needs. List your needs such as your working times. Talk to other parents - they may know of good cr\u00e8ches, childminders or nannies in your area. Arrange visits when there are children present, so you get a feel for the atmosphere. Prepare questions before your visit. Trust your instincts - you are the expert on your child. What to check When you visit, look at the way staff care for, talk to and listen to children in their care. Check: the staff are qualified and Garda-vetted there is enough staff to supervise the children at all times the premises is safe and secure there are appropriate childcare policies and procedures in place - examples include child protection, behaviour management and accidents the fees, hours and holiday periods You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ie212 You can find more tips and advice about pregnancy, babies and young children at mychild.ieGoing back to work212References Always check references before deciding on childcare.

Several weeks before your return to work date, introduce your child to your childcare provider, and begin the process of \"settling in\". They will have established routines for getting babies used to their service. Allow yourself plenty of time to prepare for putting your child in childcare and take time to learn about what you should expect from a childcare service. Babysitting arrangements Tips on choosing a babysitter Consider a babysitter's level of experience, sense of responsibility and ability to care for your child. Meet with other parents in your area to get recommendations and tips on suitable babysitters. Find out the local rate for babysitting before you hire someone and discuss pay with your sitter so that you are both comfortable with the payment beforehand. You know you have chosen a good babysitter when your child looks forward to seeing them and appears comfortable and relaxed with them. What to discuss with your babysitter Chat about your child's night time routine so your babysitter is familiar with it. This includes telling them how often you would like them to check on your sleeping child. Encourage the babysitter to visit your home and get to know your child. Show your babysitter the layout of your home including: where the fire exits and door keys are where you keep first aid equipment how equipment such as cookers and the heating system works safe sleep guidelines - see page 202 Discuss security issues with your babysitter so that they know what to do if someone calls to the door.

Let your babysitter know to the nearest half hour when you are due to come home. Write down the following numbers and give them to your babysitter: Your mobile number. Emergency telephone numbers such as 999 and Garda\u00ed. Your home's Eircode - you can find it on eircode.ie The address and telephone number of where you are going. Another contact number such as a local family member or friend in case your babysitter cannot contact you in an emergency. Do not leave a babysitter to cope with an already sick or upset child who will not settle. Going back to work and breastfeeding You can continue to breastfeed your baby when you go back to work. Before you go back to work, you need to discuss arrangements with your employer. You will need: breaks so that you can express breast milk a private place to express breast milk a fridge to store the milk until you take it home Talk to your public health nurse, a support group or a friend who has returned to work and continued to breastfeed her baby for advice. If you return to work within 6 months of the birth In Ireland, by law, breastfeeding employees are entitled to 60 minutes time off or a reduction in work hours in an eight-hour working day without loss of pay for up to 26 weeks (6 months) after birth. This may be taken in the form of one break of 60 minutes, two breaks of 30 minutes or three breaks of 20 minutes. If you plan to do this, you must let your employer know in writing of your intention to return to work and the date. Write to them at least 4 weeks before your return to work date. If you return to work after 6 monthsMothers returning to work after the six-month time period do not have a legal entitlement to breastfeeding breaks. However, talk to your employer about breastfeeding, as some workplaces have policies that will support you for as long as you continue to breastfeed. During the work day, you can express breast milk and save it for your baby.215 215 Your benefits and leave entitlements Your benefits and leave entitlements There are various state benefits, schemes and leave entitlements for pregnant women and parents.
