The profound impact herbs have on bringing balance, and healing to the body continue to amaze me. We will discuss your health concerns in great detail. I will then create an individualized treatment plan using my large in-house apothecary of single granular herbs and herbal formulas. Traditional Chinese Medicine includes Chinese herbs and herbal formulas as a paramount modality in treating illness and imbalance. I studied Traditional Chinese Herbology in the early 1990's with renowned teachers from China, at the The Institute of Chinese Medicine. I heard old stories, passed down to my teachers, of how herbs were grown, where they were found, how they were harvested and how they were used to heal people. Just learning the names of each herb took many years, learning the formulas and how they work in unison with one another is a lifetime of study. Confucius stated, \"A man without persistence will never make a good shaman or a good physician.\" For almost 30 years now, I have studied herbal medicine with awe and perseverance. "}
