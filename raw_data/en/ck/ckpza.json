CMS has determined that the evaluation design, which was submitted on February 21, 2020 and revised on July 6, 2021, meets the requirements set forth in the STCs, and therefore, approves the state's P4HB Evaluation Design. CMS has added the approved P4HB evaluation design to the demonstration's STCs as Attachment C. A copy of the STCs, which includes the new attachment, in enclosed with this letter. In accordance with 42 CFR 431.424, the approved evaluation design may now be posted to the state's Medicaid website within thirty days. CMS will also post the approved evaluation design as a standalone document, separate from the STCs, on Medicaid.gov. CMS appreciates the state's commitment to a robust evaluation of the P4HB section 1115 demonstration. Please note that three interim evaluation reports, consistent with the approved Evaluation Design, are due to CMS per the timeline also outlined in this approved Evaluation Design. Additionally, if the state is seeking to extend the demonstration, the third draft interim evaluation report (for demonstration years 1 through 8) is due at the time of the extension application. Likewise, a summative evaluation report, consistent with this approved design, is due to CMS within 18 months of the end of the demonstration period. In accordance with 42 CFR 431.428 and the STCs, we look forward to receiving updates on evaluation activities in the demonstration monitoring reports.

Allowable Expenditures. This demonstration project is approved for expenditure applicable to services rende red during the demonstration approval period designated by CMS. CMS will provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures so long as they do not exceed the pre-defined limits as specified in these STCs.1 51. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process will be used for this demonstration. The state will provide quarterly expenditure reports through the Medicaid and CH IP Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) to report total expenditures for services pr ovided under this de monstration following routine CMS-37 and CMS-64 reporting instruc tions as outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual. The state will estim ate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and federal share) subj ect to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by qua rter for each federal fiscal year on the Form CMS-37 for both the medical assistance payments (MAP) and state and local administration costs (ADM). CMS shall make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, the state shall submit Form CMS- 64 Quarterly Medicaid Expenditure Report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the qu arter just ended. If applicable, subject to the payment deferral process, CMS sha ll reconcile expenditure s reported on Form CMS-64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalizati on of the grant awar d to the State. 1 For a description of CMS's current policies related to budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration projects authorized under section 1115(a) of the Act, see State Medicaid Director Letter #18-009. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 22 of 70 52. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non-fede ral share of funding, CMS will provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rate for the demonstration as a whole for the following, subject to the budget neutrality e xpenditure limits described in section X: a. Administrative costs, incl uding those associated with the administration of the demonstration; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustment s of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the appr oved Medicaid state plan; and c. Medical assistance expenditures and prior pe riod adjustments made under section 1115 demonstration authority with dates of se rvice during the demonstration extension period; including those made in conjunction with the demonstrati on, net of enrollment fees, cost sharing, pharmacy rebates, and all other type s of third party liability. 53. Sources of Non-Federal Share. The state certifies that its match for the non-federal share of funds for this demonstration are st ate/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds must not be used to match fo r any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non-fede ral funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non-Federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a. The state acknowledges that CMS has author ity to review the sources of the non- federal share of funding for the demonstration at anytime. The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS must be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b. The state acknowledges that any amendments that impact the financial status of the demonstration must require the state to provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non-federal share offunding. 54. State Certification of Funding Conditions. The state must certify that the following conditions for non-federal share of demonstration expenditures are met: a. Units of government, including governmental ly operated health care providers, may certify that states or local tax dollars have been expende d as the non-federal share of funds under the demonstration. b. To the extent the state utilizes certifie d public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for the state shar e of title XIX payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. This met hodology must include a detailed Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 23 of 70 explanation of the process by which the state would identif y those costs eligible under title XIX (or under section 1115 author ity) for purposes of certifying public expenditures. c. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim federal match for expenditures under the demonstration, governmental entities to which general revenue funds are appropriated must certify to the state the amount of such state or local monies that are allowable under 42 CFR 433.51 to satisfy demonstration expenditures. If the CPE is claimed under a Medicaid authority, the federal matching funds received cannot then be used as the st ate share needed to receive other federal matching funds under 42 CFR 433.51(c). The entit ies that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for federal match. d. The state may use intergovernmental transfers (IGT) to the extent that such funds are derived from state or local monies and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally-operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non-fede ral share of title XIX payments. e. Under all circumstances, health care provi ders must retain 100 percent of the reimbursement for claimed expenditures. Moreover, consistent with 42 CFR 447.10, no pre-arranged agreements (cont ractual, voluntary, or otherwis e) may exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/ or redirect to the state any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business, such as payments relate d to taxes, including health care provider- related taxes,, fees, business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments, are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 55. Program Integrity. The State must have processes in place to ensure there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. The state must also ensure that there is no duplication of Fe deral funding between the state's Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Pr ogram and the demonstration. In addition, the state must ensure that there is no duplic ation of Federal funding between the State's VFC Program and the Demonstration. The state must also ensure that the state and any of its contractors follow standard program integrity principles and practices including retention of data. All data, financial re porting, and sources of non-federal share are subject to audit. 56. Medicaid Expenditure Groups (MEG). MEGs are defined for the purpose of identifying categories of Me dicaid or demonstration expenditures subject to budget neutrality, components of budget neutrality expenditure limit calculations, and other purposes related to monitoring and tracking expenditures under the demonstration. The Master MEG Chart table provides a master list of MEGs defined for this demonstration. Hypothetical budget neutrality Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 24 of 70 tests and aggregate budget neutrality tests are further describe d and subject to the language in STCs 66-68 below.

Reporting Expenditures and Member Months. The state must report all demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act and subject to budget neutrality each quarter on separate forms CMS-64.9 WAIVER and/or 64.9P WAIVER, identified by the demonstra tion project number assigned by CMS (11-W- 00249/4). Separate reports must be submitted by MEG (identified by Waiver Name) and Demonstration Year (identified by the two digit project number extension). Unless specified otherwise, expenditures must be reported by DY according to the dates of service associated with the expenditure. All MEGs identified in the Master MEG Chart as WW must be reported for expe nditures, as further detailed in the MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Mont h Reporting table below. To enable calculation of the budget neutra lity expenditure limits, the state must also report member months of eligib ility for specified MEGs. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 25 of 70 a. Cost Settlements. The state will report any cost settlements attributable to the demonstration on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (Form CMS- 64.9P WAIVER) for the Summary Sheet Line 10B, in lieu of Lines 9 or 10C. For any other cost settlements not attributable to this dem onstration, the adjustment should be reported as otherwise instructed in the State Medicaid Manual. Cost settlements must be re ported by DY consistent with how the original expenditures were reported. b. Premiums and Cost Sharing Collected by the State. The state will report any premium contributions collected by the state from de monstration enrollees quarterly on the form CMS-64 Summary Sheet line 9D, columns A an d B. In order to assure that these collections are properly credited to the de monstration, quarterly premium collections (both total computable and federal share) s hould also be reported separately by DY on form CMS-64 Narrative, and on the Total Adjustments tab in the Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. In the annual calculati on of expenditures su bject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, premiums coll ected in the demonstration year will be offset against expenditures incurred in the demonstration year for determination of the state's compliance with th e budget neutrality limits. c. Pharmacy Rebates. Because pharmacy rebates ar e included in the base expenditures used to determine the budget neutrality expenditure lim it, the state must report the portion of pharmacy rebates applicable to the dem onstration on the appropriate forms CMS-64.9 WAIVER and 64.9P waiver for the demonstrat ion, and not on any other CMS-64.9 form (to avoid double counting). The state must have a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration in a way that reasonably reflects the actual rebate- eligible pharmacy utilization of the demonstration population, and which identifies pharmacy rebate amounts with DYs. Use of the methodology is subject to the approval in advance by the CMS Regional Office, and changes to the methodology must also be approved in advance by the Regiona l Office. Each rebate amount must be distributed as state and federal revenue consistent with the federal matching rates under which the claim was paid. d. Administrative Costs. The stat e will separately track and re port additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration. Al l administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS-64.10 WA IVER and/or 64.10P WAIVER. Unless indicated otherwise on the Master MEG Chart table, administrative costs are not counted in the budget neutrality tests; however, these costs are s ubject to monitoring by CMS. e. Member Months. As part of the Semi-Annual and Annual Monitoring Reports described in section VII, the state must re port the actual numbe r of \"eligible memb er months\" for all demonstration enrollees for all MEGs identifi ed as WOW Per Capita in the Master MEG Chart table above, and as also indicated in the MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting Table below. The term \"elig ible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons enrolled in the de monstration are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for thr ee months contributes th ree eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for two months, each contribute two eligible member months, for a total of four eligible member months. The state must submit Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 26 of 70 a statement accompanying the annual report certifying the accuracy of this information. f. Budget Neutrality Specificati ons Manual. The state will create and maintain a Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual that describes in detail how the state will compile data on actual expenditures related to budget neutrali ty, including methods used to extract and compile data from the state's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), eligibility system, and accounting systems for reporting on the CMS-64, consistent with the terms of the demonstration. The Budget Ne utrality Specifications Manual will also describe how the state compiles counts of Medicaid member months. The Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual must be made available to CMS on request.

Extent of FFP for Family Planning a nd Family Planning Related Services. CMS shall provide FFP for services (including prescrip tions) provided to women at the following rates: a. For procedures or services clearly provide d or performed for the primary purpose of family planning (i.e., contraceptive initiati on, periodic or inter-pe riodic contraceptive management, and sterilizations), and which are provided in a family planning setting, FFP will be available at the 90 percent federal matching rate. Reimbursable procedure codes for office visi ts, laboratory tests, and certain other procedures must carry a primary diagnosis or a modifier that specifically identifies them as a family planning service. Note: The la boratory tests performed during an initial family planning visit for contraception incl ude a Pap smear, screening tests for STIs, blood counts, and pregnancy test. Additio nal screening tests may be performed depending on the method of contraception de sired and the protocol established by the clinic, program, or provider. Additional laboratory tests may be needed to address a family planning problem or needed during an inter-periodic family planning visit for contraception. Allowable family planning expenditures eligible for reimbursement at the enhanced family planning match rate should be entered in Column (D) on the CMS 64 form on the appropriate waiver sheets. b. In order for family planning-related services to be reimbursed at the FMAP rate they must be defined as those services generally performed as part of, or as follow-up to, a family planning service for contraception. Such services are provided because a \"family planning-related\" problem was iden tified/diagnosed during a routine/periodic family planning visit. These expenditures should be entered in Column (B) on the appropriate waiver sheets. Four kinds of family planning related services are recognized: i. A colposcopy (and procedures done w ith/during a colposcopy) or repeat Pap smear performed as a follow-up to an abnormal Pap smear which is done as part of a routine/peri odic family planning visit. ii. Treatment/drugs for STIs, except for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, where the STIs are identified/diagnosed during a routine/periodic family planning visit. A follow-up visit/encounter for the treatment/drugs may be covered at the applicable Federa l matching rate for the State. Subsequent follow- up visits to resc reen for STIs based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gu idelines may be covered at the applicable Federal matching rate for the State. iii. Treatment/drugs for vaginal infections /disorders, other lower genital tract and genital skin infections/disorders , and urinary tract infections, where Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 28 of 70 these conditions are identified/d iagnosed during a routine/periodic family planning visit. A follo w-up visit/encounter for the treatment/drugs may be covered at th e applicable Federal matching rate for the State. iv. Treatment of major complications such as: 1. Treatment of a perforated uterus due to an intrauterine device insertion; 2. Treatment of severe menstrual bleeding caused by aDepo- Provera injection requiring a dilation and curettage; or 3. Treatment of surgical or anes thesia-related complications during a sterilization procedure. c. FFP will not be available for the costs of any services, items, or procedures that donot meet the requirements specified above, even if family planning clinics or providers provide them. For example, in the instance of testing for STIs as part of a family planning visit, FFP will be available at the 90 percent Federal matching rate. The match rate for the subsequent treatment would be pa id at the applicable Federal matching rate for the State. For testing or treatment not asso ciated with a family planning visit, no FFP will be available. d. CMS will provide FFP at the appropriate 50 percent administrative match rate for general administration costs, such as, but not limited to, claims processing, eligibility assistance and determinations, outreac h, program development, evaluation, and program monitoring and reporting. 59. Extent of FFP for IPC Services. CMS shall provide FFP for services described in STC 27 for women enrolled in the IPC component of the Demonstration at the state's regular federal matching rate. 60. Demonstration Years. Demonstration Years (DY) for this demonstration are defined in the Demonstration Years table below. Table 3: Demonstration Years Financial Reporting Crosswalk Demonstration Year for the Current Approval Period Demonstration Calendar Year Time Frame DY 9 DY 9 January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 12 months DY 10 DY 1 January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 12 months DY 11 DY 2 January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 12 months DY 12 DY 3 January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 12 months Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 29 of 70 DY 13 DY 4 January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 12 months DY 14 DY 5 January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 12 months DY 15 DY 6 January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 12 months DY 16 DY 7 January 1, 2026 to December 31, 2026 12 months DY 17 DY 8 January 1, 2027 to December 31, 2027 12 months DY 18 DY 9 January 1, 2028 to December 31, 2028 12 months DY 19 DY 10 January 1, 2029 to December 31, 2029 12 months 61. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. The state must provide CMS with quarterly budget neutrality status updates, including established baseline and member months data, using the Budget Neutrality Monito ring Tool provided through the Performance Metrics Database and Analytics (PMDA) syst em. The tool incorporates the \"Schedule C Report\" for comparing the demonstration's actual expenditures to the budget neutrality expenditure limits described in section X. CMS will provide technical assistance, upon request. 2 62. Claiming Period. The state will report all claims fo r expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) within two (2) years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the e xpenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two (2) years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two- year period, the state will conti nue to identify separately ne t expenditures re lated to dates of service during the operat ion of the demonstration on the CMS-64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these e xpenditures in determining budget neutrality. 63. Future Adjustments to Budget Neutrality. CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit: a. To be consistent with enforcement of laws and policy statements, including regulations and letters, regarding impermi ssible provider payments, health care related taxes, or other payments, CMS reserves the right to make ad justments to the budget neutrality limit if any health care related tax that was in eff ect during the base year , or provider-related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related tax provisions of section 1903(w) of the Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets wi ll reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 2 42 CFR \u00a7431.420(a)(2) provides that states must comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement be tween the Secretary (or designee) and the state to implement a demonstration projec t, and \u00a7431.420(b)(1) states that the terms and conditions will provide that the state will perform periodi c reviews of the implementation of the dem onstration. CMS's current approach is to include language in STCs requiring, as a condition of demonstrat ion approval, that st ates provide, as part of their periodic reviews, regular reports of the actual costs which are subj ect to the budget neutrality limit . CMS has obtained Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of the monitoring tool under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB Control No. 0938 - 1148) and in states agree to use the tool as a condition of demonstration approval. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 30 of 70 b. To the extent that a change in federal law, regulation, or policy re quires either a reduction or an increase in FFP for expenditures ma de under this demonstration. In this circumstance, the state must adopt, subj ect to CMS approval, a modified budget neutrality agreement as necessary to comply with such change. The modified agreement will be effective upon the implementation of the change. The trend rates for the budget neutrality agreement are not subject to change under this STC. The state agrees that if mandated changes in the federal law require state legislation, the changes shall take effect on the day such state legislation becomes effec tive, or on the last day such legislation was required to be in effect under the federal law. c. The state certifies that the data it provided to establish the budget neutrality expenditure limit are accurate based on the state's accountin g of recorded histor ical expenditures or the next best available data, that the data are allowable in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and policies, and that the data are correct to the best of the state's knowledge and belief. The data supplied by the state to set the budget neutrality expenditure lim it are subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. X. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALI TY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION 64. Limit on Title XIX Funding. The state will be subject to limits on the amount of federal Medicaid funding the state may receive over th e course of the demonstration approval. The budget neutrality ex penditure targets are based on pr ojections of the amount of FFP that the state would likely have received in the absence of the demonstration. The limit consists of a Main Budget Neutrality Test, and a Hypothetical Budge t Neutrality Test, as described below. CMS's assessment of the st ate's compliance with these tests will be based on the Schedule C CMS-64 Waiver Expe nditure Report, which summarizes the expenditures reported by the state on the CMS- 64 that pertain to the demonstration. 65. Risk. The budget neutrality limits are determined on either a per capita or aggregate basis. If a per capita method is used, the state is at risk for the per capita costs of state plan and hypothetical populat ions, but not for the number of participants in the demonstration population. By providing FFP w ithout regard to enrollment in the demonstration for all demonstr ation populations, CMS will not place the state at risk for changing economic conditions; however, by placi ng the state at risk for the per capita costs of the demonstration populations, CMS assures that the demonstration expenditures do not exceed the levels that would have been realized had there been no demonstration. If an aggregate method is used, the state ac cepts risk for both enrollment and per capita costs. a. Georgia shall be at risk for the per capita cost (as determined by the method described below in this section) for Medicaid eligible in the \"Family Planning\" eligibility group, but not for the number of demonstration eligibles in this group. b. Georgia shall be at risk for both per ca pita costs and enrollment for the IPC Services group. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 31 of 70 66. Calculation of the Budget Neutrality Limits and How They Are Applied. For each DY, two annual limits are calculated: one fo r the FP component of the Demonstration and one for the IPC and Resource Mother component of the Demonstration, as described in STCs 67 and 69 below. To calculate the budget neutrality limits for the demonstration, separate annual budget limits are determined for each DY on a total computable basis. Each annual budget limit is the sum of one or more components: pe r capita components, which are calculated as a projected without-waiver PMPM cost times the corresponding actual number of member months, and aggreg ate components, which project fixed total computable dollar expenditure amounts. The annual limits for all DYs are then added together to obtain a budget neutrality lim it for the entire demonstration period. The federal share of this limit will represent the maximum amoun t of FFP that the state may receive during the demonstration period for the types of demons tration expenditures described below. The federal share will be calculated by multiplying the total computable budget neutrality expenditure limit by the appropriate Composite Federal Share. 67. Main Budget Neutrality Test. The Main Budget Neutrality Test allows the state to show that demonstration waivers and e xpenditure authorities granted have not resulted in increased costs to Medicaid, and that expenditures for the IPC components of the demonstration are below the annual budget limit for the IPC components set as described below. a. The aggregate financial cap for the IPC co mponent is determined by applying state historical enrollment and cost trend ra tes to obtain annual budget limits for demonstration years ten (10) through twenty (20). The budget neutrality limit is determined using a births averted model, under which demonstration expenditures for the IPC MEG are not to exceed the total cost of pregnant women and infants under one (1) year of age absent the births averted by the demonstration, summed. b. The budget neutrality limit for the IPC component will be fo r the total computable cost of $28,087,172,280, for the life of the demonstrati on, which is the sum of the ten (10) annual components shown in Tables 4 and 5 below. If the state chooses to operate the demonstration for fewer than ten (10) year s, then the budget neut rality limit will be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect the shortened approval period, and budget neutrality will be assessed ba sed on the shortened period.

Neutrality. CMS will determine budget neut rality pursuant to the methodology set out at STC 66. If the stat e's WW hypothetical spending exceeds the supplemental test's expenditure limit, the stat e agrees to offset that excess spending by savings elsewhere in the demonstrat ion or to return the FFP to CMS. 69. Hypothetical Budget Neutrality: Family Planning and Resource Mothers Components. The table below identifies the MEGs that are used for Hypothetic Budget Neutrality Tests 1 and 2. MEGs that are designated \"WOW Only\" or \"Both\" are the components used to calculate the budget neutrality expendi ture limit. The Composite Federal Share for the Hypothetical Budget Neutra lity Test is calcula ted based on all MEGs indicated as \"WW Only\" or \"Both.\" MEGs that are indicated as \"WW Only\" or \"Both\" are counted as expenditures agains t this budget neutrality expend iture limit. Any expenditures in excess of the limit from Hypothetical B udget Neutrality Test 1 are counted as WW expenditures under the Main Budget Neutrality Test.

Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio that will be used to convert the total computable budge t neutrality limit to federal share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the su m total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the appr oval period, as reporte d through MBES/CBES and summarized on the Schedule C. Since the actual final Composite Federal Share will not be known until the end of the demonstration's approval peri od, for the purpose of interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Com posite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or a mutually agreed to method. Each Main or Hypothetical Budget Neutrality Test has its own Composite Federal Share, as defined in the paragraph pertaining to each particular test. 71. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. CMS will enforce the budget neutrality agreement over the life of the demonstration approval period, which extends from September 1, 2019 to December 31, 2029. The Main Budget Neutrality Test may incorporate net savings, 26, 988,680, from the immediately prior demonstr ation period of 2014 through 2017 (but not from any earlier approval period). If at the e nd of the demonstration approval period the budget neutrality limit has been exceeded, the ex cess federal funds will be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is termin ated prior to the end of the demonstration period, the budget neutrality test will be based on the time period through the termination date. 72. Mid-Course Correction. If at any time during the demonstration approval period CMS determines that the demonstration is on cour se to exceed its budget neutrality expenditure limit, CMS will require the state to submit a corrective action plan for CMS review and Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 35 of 70 approval. CMS will use the threshold levels in the tables below as a guide for determining when corrective action is required.

The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform both Congress and CMS about Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provides important information, the principal focus of the evalua tion of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstra tion is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target populatio n), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted populatio n differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governmen ts could benefit from impr oved quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Designs All states with Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are requi red to conduct an evaluation, and the Evaluation Design is the roadmap for conducting the evaluati on. The roadmap begins with the stated goals for the demonstration followed by the measurable evaluation questions and quantifiable hypoth eses, all to support a determination of the extent to which the demonstration has achieved its goals . The format for the Evaluation Design is as follows: General Background Information; Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; Methodology; Methodological Limitations; Attachments. Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Design and Reports. (The graphic below depicts an example of this timeline). In addition, the state s hould be aware that section 1115 ev aluation documents are public records. The state is required to publish the Evaluation Desi gn to the state's website within thirty (30) days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(e). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of All Evaluation Designs The Evaluation Design sets the stage for the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. It is important that the Evaluation Design explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology (and limitations) for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagra m (described in more detail in paragraph B2 below) should be included with an explanation of the depicted information. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 37 of 70 A. General Background Information - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issue/s that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, the potential magnitude of the issue/s, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issue/s (e.g., a narrative on why the stat e submitted an 1115 demonstration proposal). 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstrati on, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and histor y of the implementation, and whether the draft Evaluation Design applies to an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansi on of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; the primary reason or reasons for the change; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or a ugmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals are tran slated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. 2) Include a Driver Diagram to visually aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration features and in tended outcomes. A driver diagram is a particularly effective modeling tool when working to improve health and health care through specific interventions. The diagram includes information about the goal of the dem onstration, and the features of the demonstration. A driver diagram depicts the relationship between the ai m, the primary drivers that contribute directly to achieving the aim, and the secondary drivers that are necessary to achieve the primary drivers for the demonstration. For an example and more information on driver diagrams: https://innovation.cms.gov/files/x/hciatwoaimsdrvrs.pdf 3) Identify the state's hypotheses about th e outcomes of the demonstration: 4) Discuss how the evaluation questions align with the hypotheses and the goals of the demonstration; 5) Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and/or XXI. C. Methodology - In this section, the state is to describ e in detail the proposed research methodology. The focus is on showing that the evaluation meets the prevaili ng standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable, and that where appropr iate it builds upon other publishe d research (use references). This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation will use the best available data; reports on, controls for, and makes appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to ex plain what will be measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes: 1) Evaluation Design - Provide information on how the evaluation will be designed. For example, will the evaluation utilize a pre/post comparison? A post-on ly assessment? Will a comparison group be included? Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 38 of 70 2) Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the characteristics of the target and comparison populations, to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Include information about the level of analysis (beneficiary, provider, or program level), and if populations will be stratified into subgroups. Additionally discuss the sampling methodology for the populations, as well as suppor t that a statistically reliable sample size is available. 3) Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be included. 4) Evaluation Measures - List all measures that will be calculated to evaluate the demonstration. Include the measure stewards (i.e., the organization(s) responsible for the evaluation data elements/sets by \"owning\", defining, validating; securing; and submitting for endo rsement, etc.) Include numerator and denominator information. Additional items to ensure: a.The measures contain assessments of both process a nd outcomes to evaluate the effects of the demonstration during the period of approval. b.Qualitative analysis methods may be used , and must be described in detail. c.Benchmarking and comparisons to national a nd state standards, should be used, where appropriate. d.Proposed health measures could include CMS's Co re Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessm ent of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid-Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). e. Proposed performance metrics can be selected from nationally recognized metrics, for example from sets developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation or for meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT). f. Among considerations in selecting the metrics sh all be opportunities identified by the state for improving quality of care and health outcomes, and controlling cost of care. 5) Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. Discuss the quality and limitations of the data sources. If primary data (data collected specifically for the ev aluation) - The methods by which the data will be collected, the source of the proposed question/responses, the frequency and timing of data collection, and the method of data collection. (Copies of any proposed surveys Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 39 of 70 must be reviewed with CMS for approval before implementation). 6) Analytic Methods - This section includes the details of the selected quantitative and/or qualitative measures to adequately assess the effec tiveness of the demonstration. This section should: a. Identify the specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (e.g., t- tests, chi-square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression). Table A is an example of how the state might want to articulate the analytic methods for each research question and measure. b. Explain how the state will isolate the effects of the demonstration (from other initiatives occurring in the state at the same time) through the use of comparison groups. c. A discussion of how propensity score matching and difference in differences design may be used to adjust for differences in comp arison populations over time (if applicable). d. The application of sensitivity analyses, as appropriate, should be considered. 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other info rmation pertinent to the Evaluation Design of the demonstration. Table A. Example Design Table for the Evaluation of the Demonstration Research Question Outcome measures used to address the research question Sample or population subgroups to be compared Data Sources Analytic Methods Hypothesis 1 Research -Measure 1 -Sample e.g. All -Medicaid fee-fo r- -Interrupted question 1a -Measure 2 attributed Medicaid service and time series -Measure 3 beneficiaries encounter claims -Beneficiaries with records diabetes diagnosis Research -Measure 1 -sample, e.g., PPS -Patient survey Descriptive question 1b -Measure 2 patients who meet statistics -Measure 3 survey selection -Measure 4 requirements (used services within the last 6 months) Hypothesis 2 Research -Measure 1 -Sample, e.g., PPS -Key informants Qualitative question 2a -Measure 2 administrators analysis of interview material D Methodological Limitations - This section provides detailed in formation on the limitations of the evaluation. This could include the design, th e data sources or collection process, or analytic methods. The state should also identify any efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section should include any information about feat ures of the demonstration that effectively present methodological constraints that the state w ould like CMS to take into consideration in its review. For example: Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 40 of 70 1) When the state demonstration is: a. Long-standing, non-complex, unchanged, or b. Has previously been rigorously evaluated and found to be successful, or c. Could now be considered standard Me dicaid policy (CMS published regulations or guidance) 2) When the demonstration is also considered su ccessful without issues or concerns that would require more regular reporting, such as: a. Operating smoothly without administrative changes; and b. No or minimal appeals and grievances; and c. No state issues with CMS-64 reporting or budget neutrality; and d.

Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 41 of 70 ATTACHMENT B Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initia tives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provide important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemen ted as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state a nd federal governments coul d benefit from improved quantitative and qualitative eviden ce to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Reports Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation that is valid (the extent to which the evaluation measures what it is intended to measure), and reliable (the extent to which the evaluation could produce the same results when used repeatedly). To this end, the already approved Evaluation Design is a map th at begins with the demonstrati on goals, then transitions to the evaluation questions, and to the specific hypotheses, which will be used to investigate whether the demonstration has achieved its goals. States should ha ve a well-structured analysis plan for their evaluation. As these valid analyses multiply (by a single state or by multiple states with similar demonstrations) and the data sources improve, the re liability of evaluation find ings will be able to shape Medicaid policy in order to improve the h ealth and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries for decades to come. When submitting an application fo r renewal, the interim evaluation report should be posted on the state's website with the application for public comment. Additionally, the interim evaluation report must be included in its entir ety with the application submitted to CMS. Intent of this Guidance The Social Security Act (the Act) requires an evaluation of every section 1115 demonstration. In order to fulfill this requirement, the state's submission must provide a comprehensive written presentation of all key components of the demonstra tion, and include all required elements specified in the approved Evaluation Design. This Guidance is intended to assist states with organizing the required information in a standardized format a nd understanding the criteria that CMS will use in reviewing the submitted Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 42 of 70 ATTACHMENT B Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports The format for the Interim and Summat ive Evaluation reports is as follows: A. Executive Summary; B. General Background Information; C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; D. Methodology; E. Methodological Limitations; F. Results; G. Conclusions; H. Interpretations, and Policy Imp lications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives; I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations; and J. Attachment(s). Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's subm ission of Evaluation Designs and Evaluation Reports. These dates are specified in the demonstration Special Terms and Conditions (STC s). (The graphic below depicts an example of this timeline). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. In order to assure the dissemination of the evaluation findings, lessons learned, and recommendations, the state is required to publish to the state's website the evaluation design within thirty (30) days of CMS approval, and publis h reports within thirty (30) days of submission to CMS , pursuant to 42 CFR 431.424. CMS will also publish a copy to Medicaid.gov. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 43 of 70 ATTACHMENT B Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports Required Core Components of Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports The section 1115 Evaluation Report presents the research about the section 1115 Demonstration. It is important that the report incorporate a discussion about the structure of the Evaluation Design to explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagram (described in the Evaluation Design guidance) must be included with an explanation of the depicted information. The Evaluation Report should present the relevant data and an in terpretation of the findings; assess the outcomes (what worked and what did not work); explain the limita tions of the design, data, and analyses; offer recommendations regarding what (in hindsight) the st ate would further advance, or do differently, and why; and discuss the implications on future Medicaid policy. Therefore, the state's submission must include: A. Executive Summary - A summary of the demonstration, th e principal results, interpretations, and recommendations of the evaluation. B. General Background Information about the Demonstration - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issues that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, how the state became aware of the issue, the potential magnitude of the issue, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issues. 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstra tion, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and if the evaluation is for an amendment, extens ion, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operationa l changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; wh ether the motivation for change was due to political, economic, and fiscal factors at the state and/or federal level; whether the programmatic changes were implemented to improve beneficiary health, provider/health plan performance, or administrative efficiency; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals we re translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. The inclusion of a Driver Diagram in the Evaluation Report is highly encouraged, as the visual can aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. 2) Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration; a. Discuss how the goals of the demonstration align with the evaluation questions and hypotheses; b. Explain how this Evaluation Report builds upon and expands earlier demonstration evaluation findings (if applicable); and c. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and XXI. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 44 of 70 ATTACHMENT B Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports D. Methodology - In this section, the state is to provide an overview of the research that was conducted to evaluate the section 1115 demonstra tion consistent with the approved Evaluation Design. The evaluation design should also be included as an attachment to the report. The focus is on showing that the evaluation builds upon other pub lished research (use references), and meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable. An interim report should provide any available data to date, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The Evaluation Design should assu re there is appropria te data development and collection in a timely manner to s upport developing an interim evaluation. This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation used the best available data and describes why potential alternative data sources were not used; reported on, c ontrolled for, and made appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should pr ovide enough transparency to explain what was measured and how. Specifically, this section estab lishes that the approved Evaluation Design was followed by describing: 1. Evaluation Design - Will the evaluation be an assessment of: pre/post, post-only, with or without comparison groups, etc.? 2. Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the target and comparison populations; include inclusion and exclusion criteria. 3. Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be collected 4. Evaluation Measures - What measures are used to evaluate the demonstration, and who are the measure stewards? 5. Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. 6. Analytic methods - Identify specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (t-tests, chi-square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression, etc.). 7. Other Additions - The state may provide any other inform ation pertinent to the evaluation of the demonstration. A. Methodological Limitations - This section provides sufficient information for discerning the strengths and weaknesses of the study design, data sources/collection, and analyses. B. Results - In this section, the state presents and uses the quantitative and qualitative data to show to whether and to what degree the evaluation questions and hypotheses of the demonstration were achieved. The findings should visually depict the demonstration results (tables, char ts, graphs). This section should include information on the statistical tests conducted. C. Conclusions - In this section, the state will present the conclusions about the evaluation results. 1) In general, did the results show that the dem onstration was/was not effective in achieving the goals and objectives established at th e beginning of the demonstration? Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 45 of 70ATTACHMENT B Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports 2)Based on the findings, discuss the outcomes and impacts of the demonstration and identify the opportunities for improvements. Specifically: a.If the state did not fully achieve its intended goals, why not? What could be done in the future that would better enable such an effo rt to more fully achieve those purposes, aims, objectives, and goals? D.Interpretations, Policy Implications and In teractions with Othe r State Initiatives -In this section, the state will discuss th e section 1115 demonstration within an overall Medicaid context and long range pla nning. This should include interrelations of the demonstration with other aspects of the state's Medicaid program, interactions with other Medicaid demonstrations, and other federal awards affecting service delivery, health outcomes and the cost of care under Medicaid. This section providesthe state with an opportunity to provide in terpretation of the data using evaluative reasoning to make judgments about the de monstration. This section should also include a discussion of the implications of the findings at both the state and nationallevels. E.Lessons L e arned and Recommendations - This section of the Evaluation Report involves the t ransfer of knowledge. Specifically, the \"opportunities\" for future or revised dem onstrations to inform Medicaid policymak ers, advocates, and stakeholders is just as significant as identify ing current successful strategies. Base d on the evalua tion results: 1.What lessons were learned as a result of the demonstration? 2.What would you recommend to other states which may be interested in implementing a similar approach? F.Attachment - Evaluation Design: Provide the CMS-approved Evaluation Design Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 46 of 70Family Planning Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluation Design for Georgia's Planning for Healthy Babies (P4HB) Program Introduction: Women who use contraceptives consistently and correctly throughout the course of any given year account for only 5% of all unintended pregnancies [1]. Births resulting from unintended pregnancies are twice as likely to be publicly financed as those that are intended, costing taxpayers approximately $11 bil lion annually through the Medicaid program for maternal prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum care and infant first year of life care [2, 3] . Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (2006 -2010) demonstrate that more than half of the unintended pregnancies experienced by US parous women occur within two years post -delivery, with 70% occurring within the first year post -delivery. Not surprisingly, the use of less effective methods of contraception increases the risk for unintended pregnancy post -delivery, as does younger maternal age, lower maternal education, and Medicaid vs. private health insurance [4]. Increasing women's access to health insurance has the potential to reduce unintended pregnancy by reducing financial barriers to contraceptive use [1, 5-7]. Publicly funding family planning services are cost -effective, saving nearly $4 in Medicaid expenditures for pregnancy - related care for every $1 spent . [8] Despite many policies aimed at decreasing the number of unintended births almost half of all pregnancies in the United States were characterized as unintended in 2011. [9] From 1972 until the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), states did not have the option to provide family planning services and supplies under their Medicaid state plans to individuals otherwise ineligible for Medicaid, including parents with incomes abo ve state eligibility levels and non -disabled adults who were not caring for children. Because the provision of family planning services has been found to be cost effective for the Medicaid program [10], the Secretary of Health and Human Services has and c ontinues to grant Section 1115 program authority to permit states to cover family planning services and supplies for individuals not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. Currently 26 states have either Section 1115 waivers or State Plan Amendments (SPA) that cover family planning and related services for women (and sometimes, men) not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. [11] Beginning on January 1, 2011, Georgia's Planning for Healthy Babies Program (P4HB), Georgia's section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration , expanded the provision of family planning services to low income and uninsured women. The P4HB program was designed to meet primary and reproductive health care needs of women deemed eligible by meeting the following criteria: 1) U.S. citizens or person wit h qualified proof of citizenship ; 2) residents of Georgia ; 3) otherwise uninsured and not eligible for Medicaid; 2) 18 through 44 years of age; 3) not pregnant but able to become pregnant; and 4) with incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level ( FPL) [now 211% FPL] . The P4HB program has a unique component which provides Interpregnancy Care (IPC) services, inclusive of nurse case management/Resource Mother outreach, to women who meet the above eligibility criteria and recently delivered a very low birth weight (VLBW) infant (<1500 grams or < 3 pounds 5 ounces). This interpregnancy care (IPC) component provides coverage for primary health care services, limited dental services, management of chronic health conditions, mental health or substance abuse treatment and detoxification, and case management services in addition to family planning services. P4HB also offers nurse case management/Resource Mother outreach services to women enrolled in the Georgia LIM (Low Income Medicaid) or ABD (Aged, Blind and Disabled) Medicaid programs who delivered a very low birth weight infant on or after January 1, 2011. In the last P4HB Annual Report , Georgia summarized the findings regarding the goals of P4HB as provided from their outside evaluator: ATTACHMENT C Evaluation Design Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 47 of 70 The P4HB program was granted multiple tempor ary extensions through August 29 , 2019 and th e Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) extended the P4HB waiver program effective September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029. The approval of P4HB is based on the determi nation that the continued demonstration is likely to promote the objectives of Title XIX by \"improving access to high -quality, person -centered family planning services that produce positive health outcomes for individuals. \" It is also likely to lead to po sitive health outcomes through its unique program component of Interpregnancy Care (IPC) which provides targeted benefits for physical and behavioral health services postpartum to otherwise uninsured women that have delivered very low birth weight (VLBW) i nfants in Georgia. The postpartum period is a critical window for initiating contraception, preventive, and disease management services for women with a VLBW baby . Women are motivated to prevent pregnancy and short interpregnancy intervals [12, 13 ], both of which increase the risk for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy [14]and are much more likely to occur among women who do not i nitiate contraception [15,16]. For women w ith chronic medical conditions and/or who experienced complications of pregnancy such as gestational hypertension or gestational diabetes, the period after pregnancy is an important period for secondary prevention and/or disease management to improve the woman's future health; for these women who will have another pregnancy, interpregnancy care also optimizes health before a subsequent pregnancy [17]. The postpartum period is also a particularly important period fo r women to seek treatment for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders that may be not be addressed during pregnancy and which can cause adverse maternal [18] and infant health outcomes. As part of a section 1115 demonstration authority, the state must conduct an evaluation of the demonstration, and provide regular monitoring reports to CMS to inform policy decisions. States must submit an evaluation design, interim and summative evaluati on reports, and annual monitoring reports as per 42 CFR 431.424. Since its implementation in 2011 and under the original STCs from CMS the outside evaluator has completed quarterly and annual reports on key outcomes, available a: https://medicaid.georgia.gov/planning -healthy - babies -quarterly -reporting -0. The original evaluation design was based on a quasi -experimental, pre/post analysis of key outcomes. Below is a short summary of these findings: P4HB was associated with the following positive outcomes for Georgia's Medicaid population: o decreased unintended pregnancies; o decreased teen births ; o decreased very short (< 6 months) interpregnancy intervals; and o incre ased age at first birth . Implementation of P4HB was not associated with changes in the rates of VLBW and LBW and the percent LBW and VLBW Medicaid paid births has increased 2009 (pre-P4HB) to 2018 (post -P4HB) period . P4HB enrollees who utilize covered services are less likely to conceive quickly and have improved outcomes in subsequent pregnancies relative to Right from the Start (RSM) women who do not enroll and to P4HB enrollees who do not utilize services . Women enrolled in IPC and particip ating were less likely to have clinically inappropriate interpregnancy intervals (< 12 or 18 months) than eligible women who do not enroll. Women enrolled in IPC and participating were significantly less likely to have an adverse outcome (fetal death, sti llbirth, VLBW or LBW infant) in subsequent deliveries than RSM women not enrolling. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 48 of 70 Low-income Medicaid mothers who participate in RM only benefits are far less likely to have a repeat pregnancy within 12 to 18 months postpartum. Currently, Georgia has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a n estimated 405,000 Georgia women of reproductive age remained uninsured in 2017. [1 9] Roughly 20% of these uninsured women are in the age range targeted by P4HB. The highest rates of uninsur ed are among Hispanics, single mothers, those with income < 138% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and unemployed. [18]. The P4HB program remains a critically important source of partial coverage for women of reproductive age not otherwise insured. A. Demonstration Objectives/Goals In general, the p urpose of a family planning d emonstration is to provide Medicaid coverage for family planning and/or family planning -related services in states that have not elected to include these benefits in their state plan through the new eligibility group authorized in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XXI) of the Social Security Act (the Act). As noted, Georgia has not expanded to this new eligibility group. The minimum goals generally held by CMS for family planning demonstrations include : 1. Ensure access to family planning and/or family planning -related services for low-income individuals not otherwise eligible for Medicaid; and 2. Improve or maintain health outcomes for the target population because of acces s to family planning services and/or f amily planning -related services. Under its initial and extended demonstration period , the P4HB program in Georgia goes beyond the minimum goals generally held for family planning demonstrations by specifying the follo wing objectives: 3. Reduce Georgia's Medicaid low birth weight LBW ) and VLBW rates; 4. Reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in Georgia Medicaid ; 5. Reduce Georgia's Medicaid costs by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies by women who otherwise would be eligible for Medicaid pregnancy -related services; 6. Provide access to IPC services for eligible women who have previously delivered a VLBW infant ; and 7. Increase child spacing intervals through effective contraceptive use. The evaluation design outlined below includes quantitative data coll ection, including survey data with open ended qualitative questions to examine the effects of the P4HB program on key process and outcomes measures. B. Drivers of Outcomes and Evaluation Questions /Hypotheses B.1Primary and Secondary Drivers of Outcomes Our approach to the conceptual framework follows that proposed and refined by Andersen [21]. This model asserts that the use of health care services is driven by the predisposing ( e.g., age, race/e thnicity, and education level), enabling (e.g. income, insurance) and need (health risks) characteristics of individuals within the context of the health care system and external environment in which their behavior is determined. Their use of health Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 49 of 70care s ervices and personal health practices are hypothesized to result in the final outcomes of health status and consumer satisfaction. Our overriding hypothesis is that insurance and hence , reduced out -of-pocket costs through the P4HB program components , lead to increased use of primary and family planning services by women 18 -44 and otherwise uninsured in Georgia. In turn, this leads to decreased rates of unintended or mistimed pregnancies. In addition, the receipt of expanded case management/social support services through the IPC and RM components lea ds to increased use of post -partum health care services and improved health outcomes and any subsequent pregnancy/delivery. In the Driver Diagrams below , we state the overall aim s and related outcomes as well as the primary and secondary drivers to meet these aims and achieve the anticipated outcomes of the P4HB program. Given the differences in the eligible women and the services covered by the FP only and IPC/RM only components , we present separate driver diagrams for each. This allows us to highlight the different aims and 'drivers' specific to these program components. For brevity , we d enote the women of reproductive age [18 to 44] who are eligible for P4HB as women of reprod uctive age (W RA) in the following diagrams . Family Planning Only Diagram The overall goal of Medicaid family planning waivers is to ensure access and use o f family planning services among persons not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. This is a similar ov erarching goal of the FP component of P4HB for low -income women ages 18 -44. Related to this overall goal , specific goals of P4HB a re to reduce unintended pregnancies among Georgia Medicaid live births and their related costs as well as increase child spaci ng through effective contraceptive use. The following driver diagram shows the primary and secondary drivers to achieving these goals within the FP only component. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 50 of 70A primary driver with the FP only component is the increased use of preventive services ( e.g., STD testing/treatment, family planning visits). Secondary drivers that affect this use is enrollment of a significant portion of eligible women of WRA into P4HB and once enrolled, assignment to one of the four Medicaid CMOs. The CMOs provide access to a network of primary and specialty providers that accept Medicaid and can provide family planning and family planning -related services. A primary driver to reducing unintended pregnancies is the use of contraceptives that are known to be effective if used appropriately; in our evaluation we use the WHO tiers of effectiveness which emphasize the use of long -acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Secondary drivers in increasing the use of effective contraceptives include providers ' development of reproductive health plans with WRA in P4HB, discussion of the relative effectiveness of contraceptives and follow -up with enrollees on their satisfaction and appropriate use. A primary driver to achieving the aim of increased use of fami ly planning services among P4HB enrollees is their retention in the program as long as they are eligible. Recertification of eligibility can create barriers to retention and in turn, disrupt their use of effective family planning services. Secondary drive rs therefor e include reducing these barriers, increasing knowledge of covered services and monitoring reasons for disenrollment to assure that uninsured eligible women do not lose access to effective contraceptives. Since a large portion of the VLBW infan ts born to Medicaid insured women are first births a primary driver of reductions in LBW/VLBW is the reduction of risky behaviors including teen births/first births. Secondary drivers include reductions in other risks such as smoking and substance abuse. Among teens or other WRA with a recent birth, reductions in short (<18 months) interpregnancy intervals is an important secondary driver. IPC/RM Only Diagram Another overall goal of family planning waivers is to improve or maintain health outcomes for t he target population because of access to family planning or family planning -related services. Specific to P4HB, the goals of the IPC/RM only components of P4HB are to increase the use of primary care (inclusive of family planning services) as well as the additional RM and related social support services needed by these women. Their eligibility is predicated on a recent VLBW infant and they are deemed to be at high -risk for a repeat poor birth outcome. If this goal is achieved for these women , the expect ed outcomes are better managed chronic conditions, optimal interpregnancy intervals and fewer maternal morbidities for those with a subsequent pregnancy. The ultimate outcome s would be a higher rate of full -term infants and lower rates of LBW/VLBW infants among births to these Medicaid insured women. The following driver diagram shows the primary and secondary drivers to achieving these goals within the IPC/RM only component. A primary driver to reducing risks among these women is the enhanced case manag ement included in their benefit package. This entails the assessment of chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes and provision of health care services postpartum that can better manage them. This applies to physical as well as mental health con ditions; referrals to providers able to treat mental health and substance abuse disorders (SUD) is a secondary driver. Secondary drivers that affect the ability of the program to meet its goals are the enrollment of new mothers of VLBW infants soon after d elivery. Once enrolled, increased rates of any postpartum visit as well as rates of use of primary care are secondary drivers. The RM component of P4HB is designed to help these mothers get to their health care provider, make connections to social servic es in their community and remain connected to the provider system. The RMs are deployed by the CMOs but less is known about the process of employment and/or deployment of this important resource or their use by P4HB enrollees. An important secondary driv er is a contact by the RM soon after delivery and enrollment in IPC/RM only components . Other secondary drivers include increasing the rate of contact between the RM and P4HB enrollee as well as a clear assessment of the types of social services needed. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 51 of 70 The RM component should help reduce the barriers these women face due to social determinants of health in their personal and community lives. A primary driver is the use of referred social services that can address such needs. Secondary drivers includ e clear connections between the CMO providers and community service entities, increased knowledge about these supporting entities among the IPC/RM only women and data on the rate at which the RMs increase use of needed social support services. A primary d river is an increase in interpregna ncy intervals for the IPC/RM only women. Included in the services these women should receive is a reproductive health plan that makes them aware of the risks of a short or non -optimal interpregnancy interval (<18 months); this is a secondary driver. Increasing the use of contraceptives that are known to be effective if used appropriately ( e.g., LARCs) is a key secondary driver. As the use of LARCs is increased the goals of lower maternal morbidities in subsequent pregnancies and lower rates of preterm and LBW/VLBW births can potentially be achieved. B.2 Evaluation Questions and Analysis In Table 1 below we state the research questions, hypothesi zed effect s, and the data sources we propose to use to address the research questions in the evaluation of P4HB . Each of six core research question s are aligned within the seven goals of either family planning waivers generally or the specific goals of P4HB as noted earlier. Under each goal , we include the: 1) associated research question, 2) hypothesis, 3) data source s, 4) brief analytic approach and 5) description of treatment and control groups where applicable . We include both process measures ( e.g., enrollment, receipt of medically appropriate care) and outcome measures (e.g. birth weight, interpregnancy intervals) in th is table. A detailed description of the analytic approach es is included in section C: Methodology. We note that our proposed evalua tion goes beyond the basic measures noted by CMS for evaluation of f amily planning demonstrations and includes data, measures, and analyses specific to the unique IPC and RM only component s of P4HB. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 52 of 70 We confirm that state -specific files ( e.g., Medicaid a dministrative and financial data, vital records and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System or PRAMS) will be made available to the outside evaluator. We also include data and analyses from publicly available sources where helpful in completing this ev aluation . Table 1.

Methodology 1. Evaluation design : The evaluation design will utilize a post -only assessment with a comparison group for most of the outcomes that will be analyzed . The timeframe for the post -only period will begin when the current demonstration period began (September 1, 2019) and will end when the current demonstration period ends (December 31, 202 9). For selected outcomes that have not bee n examined in a previous pre/post analysis , we will test for significant effects from the initial P4HB implementation pre (200 8-2010) and post periods (2012 -2019). In this analysis we wil l focus on pre/post analysis of: 1) guideline concordant screening s ervices, and 2) severe maternal morbidities among first and repeat Medi caid pregnancies/deliveries. 2. Data Collection and S ources : The data used in the proposed evaluation will include data collected both retrospectively and prospectively. Administrative Data . Most of the data outlined in the above table for use in the evaluation will be retrospective in nature and come from DCH and its vendor IBM Watson. The latter entity uses the raw claims/enroll ment data to create uniform research files for the outside evaluator. Medicaid eligibility and claims data are received annually in August covering claims through June 30 of that year. These files include all eligibility and delivery claims paid by Medicaid and CHIP and nine months of claims pre-delivery and 12 months post -delivery; all eligibility and claims for infants born to all women whose deliveries were paid by Medicaid and CHIP; crosswalk linking Medicaid ID of mother with Medicaid ID of infant (85% linkage rate); all eligibility and claims for women receiving at least one family planning service; all Medicaid and CHIP eligible females ages 10 through 50; and all eligibility and claims data for all women enrolled in the Medicaid 1115 Demonstration (aid categories 180 -183). Additionally, every November, IBM Watson delivers a crosswalk file that links the mother's Medicaid claims/enrollment data to the prior year's vital records ( birth, fetal death) from the Department of Public Health (DPH). The prior year's vital records are also received every November from DPH. Approximately 92% of mothers have a valid Medicaid -vital records link. We treat the vital records as the 'gold s tandard' in measuring birthweight and hence, reporting on this outcome as well as multivariate analysis of this outcome, will be completed in annual and interim reports . A new file from DCH will be used to assess the receipt of RM services by IPC and RM only enrollees. This file was updated beginning in 2016 and provides a measure of number of RM contacts/services and referrals to needed social support services. DCH will send a linking ID to the evaluator so that the se files can be analyzed in conjunction with the receipt of medically appropriate preventive and disease management services postpartum among IPC/RM women . Initial review of these files indicates a high linkage percentage (~75%) even before aligning the w omen's enrollment periods between files . Survey Data. In the proposed evaluation, survey data will continue to be collected through a vendor chosen by the CMOs who serve P4HB enrollees. The outside evaluator will work with DCH to revise the P4HB surve y tool such that it maximizes the responses rate (i.e. annual text based surveys) and obtains select qualitative information about P4HB beneficiaries through open -ended questions about recommendations for improvement . The evaluator will analyze weighted su rvey data on questions which can be summarized quantitatively and will summarize 'themes' from the open -ended questions for reporting in semi -annual reports to CMS. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 57 of 70 Publicly Available D ata. Publicly available data to be used in the proposed evaluation in clude: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monit oring System (PRAMS) data; Behavioral Risk Assessment Monitoring System (BRFSS), American Community Survey (ACS) . Data Analysis Strategy: In the text that follows the analytic methods propose d to address the core research questions enumerated in Table 1 are described . We note that v irtually all of the proposed analysis is quantitative in nature. Quantitative Methods: For each of the evaluation question s, we describe the statistical and analytica l methods that will be employed to test for effects of P4HB and changes in those effects over time. The research questions are designed to address key process and outcome measures for the three groups of women affected by access to and use of P4HB covered services. These groups are women enrolled in the: 1) family planning only (FP only); 2) Interpregnancy Care Component (IPC); and 3) Resource Mother only (RM only) components of P4HB. RQ1 : How did beneficiaries utilize covered health services? Data and Analysis : The primary data source of data will be the administrative data on enrollment/claims. Total numbers of users and rates of use of family planning and contraceptive service s, receipt of covered primary and preventive care among all enrollees and medically appropriate preventive and disease management among IPC/RM enrollees will be estimated for each demonstration year. Service receipt will include an assessment of enrollees' receipt of guideline -concordant screening services (e.g. STI screening and treatment , vaccinations). To assess a broader view of access to primary and preventive service s we will use data from the BRFSS for uninsured women ages 18 to 44 in Georgia and oth er states in the Southeast or nation t o assess the levels and changes in the level of receipt of preventive care (age -appropriate STI screening and treatment , cervical cancer screening, vaccinations) for uninsured women of reproductive age under 211% FPL in Georgia compared to other states. This analysis will be multivariate and include state and year fixed effects; age; and urban/rural county . This analysis will use women in states that have not expanded Medicaid or changed their family planning programs significantly over the years studied as a comparison group of women to those eligible for P4HB in Georgia. We will test for effect of P4HB pre ( 2008 -2010) and post (2011 -2013) its initial implementation . Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed many lower income women otherwise served by Medicaid and P4H B to obtain subsidized insurance through the Marketplace and expanded fund ing for safety net providers that serve the uninsured, we will also test for changes in the receipt of these preventive services among this group of women post 2014. RQ2: Do P4HB enrollees maintain coverage for 12 months or longer? How do sociodemographi c, county, and economic factors a ffect the probability of disenrollment ? Data and Analysis : The primary data source will be the administrative data on enrollment for all P4HB enrollees but analysis will be subset to the three enrollee groups in the: 1) family planning only (FP only); 2) Interpregnancy Care Component (IPC); and 3) Resource Mother only (RM only) components of P4HB. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 58 of 70We will provide d escriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) of the total and total consecutive months enrolled, percentage enrolled < 12 months and 12 -24 months and the distribution of disenrollment by movement to: 1) RSM; 2) LIM or 3) no Medicaid enrollment. We will use Chi -square or T -test of differences across 1) the four CMOs, 2) racial/ethnic and 3) age groups of women within each P4HB component. We will construct a file of month to month enrollment for w omen in the family planning only group and estimate proportional Hazard rate models on time to disenrollment or the odds of disenrollment by 12 months and by 24 months . This will be a multivariate model that will incorporate covariates to control for : 1) age; 2) race/ethnicity ; 3) user/non -users of P4H B services; 4) CMO; and 5) county characteristics (employment, percent uninsured, poverty, urban/rural ). We will present odds ratios in reports a nd Issue Briefs for DCH as these are more easily interpreted by policymakers . This type of model will also be estimated fo r the IPC and separately, the RM only enrollees. Since these women have recently given birth the control variables will include those listed above as well as measures such as : 1) parity; 2) evidence of chronic conditions and 3) use of any (and categories such as primary care, disease management, family planning) services postpartum. RQ3 a, b & c: Do health outcomes (a: severe maternal mor bidities ; b: birth outcomes; c: optimum interpregnancy intervals) improve among beneficiaries using services? Data and Analysis : The primary data source for Research Questions 3 a, b & c will be the administrative data on Medicaid enrollment and claims linked to vital records as well as county level data where a vailable . These analyses are highly interrelated but have been organized under P4H B Goals 2, 4 and 7 in Table 1 and are discussed as separate research questions here . Analysis of RQ 3a . Lower income women entering Medicaid due to pregnancy are at higher risk of poor maternal and infant outcomes. The Right from the Start (RSM) Medicaid eligible women for example, are not eligible pre -pregnancy, often delay prenatal care and due to being lower income may have generally higher health risks. Women in th e IPC/RM only component are at increased risk of repeat pregnancies at short intervals and even higher risks of subsequent poor outcomes. In RQ 3a the dependent variable will be the probabili ty of severe maternal morbidities (SMM) in a pregnanc y. SMM are defined based on any one of 21 indicators and c orresponding ICD codes which will be found in the claims data for both the FP only and IPC/RM P4HB enrollees. See https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/smm/severe -morbidity -ICD.htm for further detail on the codes to be used . Using this outcome measure we will estimate th e following type of logistic regression model : 3a) =+1 +2 +3+ 4+ Where represents the outcome of severe maternal morbidity ( SMM ) for the ith woman at time of outcome (e.g. SMM at delivery) . The variable is a 0/1 indicator for participation by the ith woman in the F P only or IPC/RM only component s of P4HB. Among the women in the RSM eligibility category who delivered an infant on Georgia Medicaid in the post P4HB year s we will identify those who have enroll ed/participat ed in P4HB as a 'treatment' group ( = 1) and those not enrolling as a 'control' group ( = 0). Similarly, we will use t hose eligible for and participating in the IPC/RM only components of P4HB as the treatment group and those eligible but not participating, as the control group. T he SES vector will include age, race/ethnicity, month/year of index birth, parity, and pregna ncy complications. We will Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 59 of 70also include a CE vector of county environment measures (e.g. employment, percent uninsured, and poverty ). Since the data are linked to vital records we will test models with a fuller set of demographic and clinical determinants (education, parity, pre -pregnancy chronic conditions) but the samples will be smaller given a linkage rate of ~90 -95%. The variable measures the number of months enrolled in the FP only or IPC/RM only component s of P4HB . Analysis of RQ 3 b. When analyzing the effect of P4HB on birth outcomes we will again use multivariate logistic regression but here the dependent variable is t he probability o f full term, normal weight live birth s. We will use multivariate logistic regression to assess the di fference in this probability . The generic logistic equation for this analysis is again shown below: 3b) =+1 +2 +3+ 4+ Where represents a live birth for the ith woman at time of outcome (Medicaid paid live birth in month t). The variable is a 0/1 indicator for participation by the ith woman in the FP only or IPC /RM only componen ts of P4HB. For the FP only women we will use the comparison group of RSM women w ho could have participated in P4HB but did not. For the IPC women we will use those w ith a VLBW infant delivered on Medicaid but not enrolling in IPC and for the RM only group we will use LIM women with a VLBW infant not enrolling in the RM only component of P4HB. Control variables will again include those noted in RQ 3a. Separate analys is will be completed on those participating and using P4HB services ('treatment') versus those not using P4HB services ('control'). Categories of use (e.g. primary care, family planning, effective contraceptives) and intensity of use (e.g. number of visits or amounts paid) will also be tested. Analysis of RQ 3 c. When analyzing the effect of P4HB on optimum interpregnancy intervals we will again use multivariate logistic regression . The dependent variable here is the probability of conceiving within 6, 12 or 18 months after enrollment in, for example, the IPC/RM only component. We will use the generic logistic equation for this analysis as shown below: 3c) =+1 +2 +3+ 4+ Where represents a subsequent pregnancy for the ith woman at time of outcome (e.g. repeat pregnancy at month t). The variable is a 0/1 indicator for participation by the ith woman in the IPC/RM only component of P4HB. For the IPC women we will use a comparison group of RSM women with a VLBW infant delivered on Medicaid but not enrolling in IPC and for the RM only group we will use LIM women with a VLBW infant not enrolling in RM only component of P4H B. Control variables will be as presented in RQ 3 a. Both t he IPC/RM women are at increased risk of short interpregnancy interva ls. The dependent variable will be the probability of a very short (< 6 month s) or suboptimum (< 18 months) interpregnancy interval . Since these women have recently delivered a VLBW infant the 'start time' for the subsequent outcomes will be the month of their index birth or enrollment in IPC/RM after that index birth. Separate analys is will be completed on those IPC/RM enrolling and using P4HB services ('treatment') versus those enrolling and not using P4HB services ('control'). Here, we will focus on the use of any family planning services and in turn, the use of more effective (Tie r 1) contraceptives with a focus on the use of long -acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 60 of 70If we find a sufficient sample of women in LIM with a VLBW infant prior to P4HB (e.g. 2008 -2010) we will test a Pre/Post P4HB indicator Post = 1 and interact t his with . This particular model would use an individual fixed -effects and omit demographics. An additional set of analyses will use the maternal long ID in the linked Medicaid and vital records to analyze whether the probability of any subsequ ent birth to a P4HB enrollee being Medicaid or private insured. The hypothesis here is that participation in P4HB and receipt of family planning and related services has served to increase the woman's health and ability to plan the timing of their pregnan cies such that they are able to remain in the labor force and access to private insurance. RQ4: Was P4HB associated with a reduction in the share of unintended pregnancies among Medicaid live births ? Data and Analysis : The primary data source will be the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data available to the outside evaluator through and existing DUA with the CDC. Survey data with appropriate weights are made available for states with adequate respon se rates (generally greater than 60%). Unintended Birth : Unintended birth is a key outcome of interest that we can only measure with survey data. In prior work we tested the effect of P4HB on several measures of unintended pregnancy/birth. For years 2008-2010, the PRAMS data ask ed the question: \"Thinking back to just before you got pregnant with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?\" and included as possible responses the following options: 1) I wanted to be pregnant sooner , 2) I wante d to be pregnant later , 3) I wanted to be pregnant then , and 4) I didn't want to be pregnant then or at any time in the future . In 2012, however, a fifth response choice was added: 5) I was not sure what I wanted . We t herefore will continue to teste sever al measures of unintended pregnancy/birth. The first will classify mothers as having an unintended pregnancy/birth if they responded that they were: 1) unsure what they wanted; or 2) were not trying to get pregnant . With this measure, we will test models excluding mothers wh o were unsure what they wanted. We with then test models based on whether a mother was trying to get pregnant based on the following questio n: When you got pregnant with your new baby, were you trying to get pregnant? We previ ously used data from 2008 through 2013 and used a difference -in-difference method to estimate the effects of P4HB on these outcomes. With this method, changes in the outcomes from the control group are subtracted from those of the treatment group, controll ing for any group -specific and time -specific effects that may have altered the outcomes during the study years . We used logistic analysis and controlled for mother 's age, race/ethnicity, number of stressors, if the mother drank alcohol three months before her pregnancy, if the mother smoked three months before her pregnancy, number of previous live births, and number of terminations. All regression models included state and year fixed effects and adjusted standard errors for clustering at the state/year lev el. In prior analysis of the 2008 -2013 data we used a treatment group of mothers in Georgia that were uninsured pre -pregnancy but insured with Medicaid at delivery and the control group includes these women in the control states (Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Maryland). The Georgia PRAMS data were not available to the outside evalu ator for years 2014 -2017; weighted data are now available for 2018 and more current yea rs from the CDC. We will obtain these data by appending an existing DUA for Georgia and comparison states to assess whether the decrease in unintended pregnancies after the implementation of P4HB continued through the more current period. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 61 of 70RQ5: Is the P4HB program providing the IPC services to IPC and RM only women as originally envisioned? Data and Analysis : The primary data source s will be the administrative data on Medicaid enrollment and claims as well as a file newly available to the outside evaluator that includes the encrypted Medicaid ID for individual P4HB members who receiv ed RM services. After 2016 this file contained individual data on the number and nature of RM contacts, referrals and use of social support services by each woman. Once it is linked to the Medicaid claims/enrollment data we will complete analysis of the 1) use of any services, 2) medically appropriate serv ices and 3) receipt of RM services and referrals. Total numbers of users and rates of use of non -family planning related covered services (including primary care, dental, and substance use treatment), receipt of covered primary and preventive care among a ll enrollees and medically appropriate preventive and disease management among IPC/RM enrollees will be estimated for each demonstration year. Service receipt will include an assessment of enrollees ' receipt of clinically -indicated screening and follow -up services based on evidence of diagnoses of chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, substance use disorder) and/or diagnoses of complications of pregnancy (e.g., gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension) in the index pregnancy. We will provide d escriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) of the total number and type of clinical services utilized for women in the IPC and RM only components overall and according to their chronic health condition/pregnancy complication status. We will use Chi -square or T -test of differences across 1) the four CMOs, 2) racial/ethnic and 3) age groups of women within IPC and RM only components . Total numbers and rates of use of RM services, including referrals to social support services . Survey Data and Methods The key research question that needs to be addressed with survey data is shown below. RQ6: Are beneficiaries sufficiently aware of services covered and available providers? Does this result in high levels of satisfaction with the P 4HB program? Data : The evaluation design assumes the CMOs will continue to contract with the previous survey firm to implement a survey aimed at P4HB beneficiaries. The member survey has now been revised and is included in Appendix A. As written, it consists of five composite areas with yes/no responses to approximately 30 statements . There is also one open -ended free -text question for survey respondents to enter their recommendations for how to improve P4HB. The messaging to P4HB members about the first survey will occur July -September 2021. DCH and the CMOs will work collaboratively to determine effective and timely communication to members prior to the actual launch. The survey will be launched October 20 21 and every October thereaf ter. Survey results will be submitted to DCH by the CMOs in December of each year to be summarized in the annual reports due to CMS in March of the following year. As the outside evaluator we support a sampling design based on 80% power to detect changes over time in the answers to questions related to enrollee access to contraceptives, availab ility of providers and indicators of satisfaction . We estimate that a sample of approximately 1,500 FP only members will allow detection of a 5 percentage point increase in 'start ed using birth control' and 'able to get preventive care (such as Pap smears) and family planning counseling ' with 80% power. This same sample size will allow detection of a 2.5 percentage point decrease in 'cannot find a doctor or nurse willing to take P4HB clients' and a 1.5 percentage point decrease in 'my P4HB doctor or nurse will not prescribe the birth control method I want '. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 62 of 70To implement this design DCH will ask the CMOs to send a full roster of current enrollees with their 1) contact information 2) eligibility (FP only, IPC/RM only) category and 3) member months to the survey firm. The survey firm will randomly sample 4,000 FP only enrollees from each of the three (as of May 1) CMOs for the survey . All IPC/RM only enrollees in the roster need to be contacted with the survey . A response rate of 12% or higher among the FP only enrollees, or approximately 500 of these enrol lees per CMO, will meet the 1,500 estimated sample size noted above. The response rate among the IPC/RM only enrollees needs to be as high as possible. The vendor will use a mail plus phone /text follow -up (of non -respondents) survey method in order to increase the response rates from where they have been historically. The CMOs have been and will continue to be, fully engaged in th is survey design process to ensure operational feasibility and standard deployment of the survey. Analysis of RQ6 : The evaluator will be able to analyze weighted survey data on questions which can be summarized quantitatively and will report on themes from a content analysis of the open -ended questions for reporting in semi -annual reports to CMS. Qualitative Met hods: The evaluation design does not include the collection or analysis of qualitative data beyond the addition of an open -ended question to the survey the CMOs will implement through their vendor . Covid -19 Impacts. We will focus on any needed changes to the methods including the definition of comparison groups that will be helpful in completing the analyses as described in the forgoing table and text. Also, a s denoted in the guidance from CMS --Implications of COVID -19 for Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluations: Considerations for States and Evaluators , states must document changes to the implementation of the demonstration caused by the pandemic and note the challenges they create for planned evaluation activities as that information b ecomes available. We anticipate that both enrollment (timing and duration) as well as service utilization by enrollees could be impacted by the pandemic. Specifically, while enrollees have been able to remain in P4HB and other categories longer than usua l under previous eligibility criteria, utilization of many services usually provided in -person have been curtailed because of delays in accessing services from health care providers and clinics that closed or had limited appointment availability during COV ID. As such, w e will carefully document the impact of COVID -19 on length of enrollment in the components of P4HB , as well as the potential decline in movement from the RSM eligibility category into P4HB eligibility postpartum related to the COVID -19 extensions , and the utilization of services among enrollees by comparing enrollment and utilization measures during th e pandemic to the same measures for the pre -pandemic period . Comparison of the characteristics of newly enrolled P4HB members to the new enrollees in prior periods will be helpful in understanding any changes in the demographic composition of women enrolli ng in P4HB during CO VID-19. Similarly, comparisons of the characteristics of enrolled women who u tilize and do not utiliz e services will be helpful in understanding any disproportionate impact of the pandemic on utilization among enrollees. From an evalu ation perspective, we anticipate that the biggest challenge will be in accounting for differences in the measurement of service utilization and in particular , contraceptive utilization , during the COVID -19 period in relation to pre - and post -pandemic peri ods. This is important to several of the proposed analyses that use non -participants (non -users of P4HB services among those enrolled) as a comparison group. To begin to address this, we w ill document the use of additional procedure codes (e.g. for telehe alth services) telemedicine service codes (e.g ., POS 02 code to indicate a telemedicine service) to measure total (in person and telemedicine) and telemedicine service utilization by P4HB enrollees during Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 63 of 70the March 2020 through December 31 2021 time period as best as possible. D. Methodological Limitations There are several limitations in both the quantitative and qualitative sections of this proposed evaluation design. We address these separately in the following text. Quantitative . The proposed design uses quantitative analysis of several databases with the emphasis on the linked Medicaid claims/vital records data. Any analysis of claims data has the limitation that we only observe those services for which providers bill Medicaid through their CMO and are paid for while the woman is enrolled in Medicaid /CHIP and inclusive of the P4HB program. Yet, being able to observe women moving in and out of p regnancy/delivery or in and out of Medicaid coverage provides significant power to the types of analyses proposed here. In the original evaluation design the outside evaluator used a quasi -experimental pre/post design in the analysis of the Medicaid/claim s and PRAMS data. Given the maturity of the P4HB program this evaluation design only uses this type of more rigorous analysis for selected outcomes (e.g. severe maternal morbidities) using Medicaid administrative files and for analysis of unintended pregn ancies , using the PRAMS data. Most of the analysis proposed here will use a control/comparison group of women to increase the rigor of the analysis. For example, we propose to use women eligible for P4HB but not enrolling as a control/comparison group in several parts of the analysis. Use of a control/comparison group adds power to the analysis of outcomes in the post -period data and we control for characteristics of the treatment (here, those eligible and participating by enrolling) and control/compari son groups . Yet, there are very likely unobserved characteristics of the se two groups that relate to the decision to enroll and/or participate by using services that results in bias. For example, those choosing to participate and, those choosing to partic ipate and use services are either more risk -adverse or more oriented toward healthy behaviors independent of P4HB . If the latter holds, our findings regarding the effects of P4HB will be biased upward. Finally, we propose to use publicly available data sources (e.g. BRFSS, PRAMS) in parts of the analysis to proxy those women affected by P4HB . While these data provide valuable information on outcomes in other states that can be used to help evaluate the effects of the P4HB program , there are limitations to our ability to identify study populations that are similar to the P4HB eligible and/or enrolled population s. For example, the BRFSS provides data on the rate of screening among uninsured women under 21 1% FPL in Georgia and comparison states but does not allow us to restrict the sample to citizens. This means we are not truly identifying the group of women eligible for P4HB. If the comparison states have a significantly different (smaller) percentage of non -citizens, th e effect of P4HB will likely be biased downward . Similar survey data were successfully used in an analysis of a family planning waiver on preventive care servic es. [22] There are also limitations to identifying the group of Medicaid births affected by P4HB in the PRAMS data . In these data we use births to those uninsured pre -pregnancy but insured with Medicaid at delivery ; this serves as a proxy for the group of women only eligible for Medicaid when pregnant . However, if some women who would have been eligible as low -income parents ( LIM in Georgia) do not enroll until they are pregnant, they will be included along with those who are only eligible when pregnant. These women are likely a small percentage of those enrolling during pregnancy, but they are lower income and more likely citizens than those only eligible /enrolling when pregnant or at delivery . Yet, the PRAMS data are the only source of data on births re sulting from unintended pregnancy by state and over time . They have been successfully used to evaluate family planning waivers23 using a target population as defined here which should largely reflect t he targeted P4HB eligible population. Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 64 of 70 Qualitative. The survey has historically been limited to quantifiable measures of P4HB enrollees' knowledge of and experiences with the program. Hence, the outside evaluator has not had rich, contextual information to explain the respondents' answers as wo uld be possible if we were to include a full range of qualitative data collection methods in the evaluation. For example, with the prior survey results, we were not able to solicit ideas and recommendations for improving the P4HB program. Qualitative meth ods, such as focus groups or interviews, would allow for such detailed information that may better inform the continual monitoring and quality improvement efforts needed to evaluate P4HB . This evaluation design includes a revis ion to the survey instrument to include an open -ended question that could illicit some contextual information. T he outside evaluator , as noted earlier, will work with DCH to influence the sample design and the desired response rates . E. Milestones for Evaluation Activity Milestones . The proposed research questions and analysis include a series of descriptive and multivariate analyses on previously used as well as new, outcome measures. Since developing and evaluating new measures (e.g. severe maternal morbidities) will take more tim e than other analysis such as enrollment and birth outcomes they will be presented in later interim reports as detailed in Table 2 below.

Th e summative report reflect ed the original evaluation design which was quasi -experimental in na ture and i ncluded data from 2008, prior to the implementation of P4HB through D ecember 31, 2019. The annual monitoring report include d analysis of enrollment patterns, use of services and outcomes during the January - December 2019 period. Major milestones during the renewal period include three interim reports in 2022, 2 025 and 2028 as noted. The first in 2022, will report on the analysis of research questions 1, 2, 4 and 5. These analyses will use administrative data for years 2020 and 2021 as well as secondary data from the BRFSS and PRAMS for the years noted earlier. Results from the enrollee survey in 2021 will also be included. The 20 25 interim report will include updates where possible (e.g. PRAMS data) , to results from research questions in the 2022 interim report . The BRFSS analysis will not be updated. The analysis in this report will focus on results of the three components of research question 3. These analyses are multivariate in nature and will use data on outcomes through December 2024. Results from the annual enrollee survey s will also be included. This will inc lude tests on significant changes in enrollees' awareness of covered services, available providers, and satisfaction with the program from the annual 2021 through 2023 surveys. The 2028 interim report will include updates where possible , to prior results from research questions in the 2022 and 2025 interim reports. It will include analysis of research question 5 using the newly available files on RM visits, referral and use of social support services in the community. Once linked to the administrative data on use of health care services and maternal health/outcomes this analysis will shed important information on how well this unique component of P4HB is being implemented and in turn, how it affects women's health. These analyses involve new linking and a nalytic processes and will use data on outcomes through December 202 7. Results from the enrollee survey s through 2025 will be included in this interim report. This will add to our understanding of significant changes 2021 -2025 in enrollees' awareness of covered services, available providers, and satisfaction with P4HB . The summative report for the full renewal period , due 18 months after the end of the renewal period, will use data through December 2029 . This report will provide a summary of findings from all six research questions, the annual enrollee surveys and CMO report s previously summarized in the semi -annual and annual reports. F. Independent Contractor: The state plans to continue to use Emory University, Ro llins School of Public Health (RSPH) as the outside evaluator in this renewal period. This entity has been the evaluator since the initiation of P4HB and hence, can seamlessly continue the evaluation work under an existing data use agreement with the Depar tment of Community Health (DCH) and the Department of Public Health (DPH) in Georgia. Their simplified budget for each annual period from 2021 through 2031 i s shown below in Table 3. The summative report for the full ten-year renewal period is due 18 mon ths after the end of this period in December 2029 and hence, falls in 2031. Budget is included for the last six months of 2031 for the evaluator to help with report documentation, repor ts to the legislator, final Issue Briefs, etc. The major budget catego ries shown in the budget are: 1) Data Cleaning and Programming; 2) Survey 3) Analysis & Report Preparation; 4) Project Management . Approval Period: September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2029 Page 66 of 70 Table 3. Annual Direct Costs for Evaluator Staff by Budget Categories and Calendar Year Budget Categories Programming : External evaluator activities for this task include receipt of multiple files of administrative data on enrollment, claims/encounters, drug files, provider files and multiple state - generated reports on enrollment. In addition, quarterly reports from the CMOs are received as well as financial reports on capitated payments to P4HB CMOs. Along with the administrative data, a crosswalk is received that allows the evaluator to link Medicaid mother/baby records to vital records. Vital records include all live birth and stillborn records. These various files are used f or the reports required in the renewal period, preparation of the series of reports required under the new STCs and for the variables used in the analysis addressing research questions 1 -5. An ave rage of 866 hours annually for this task are estimated across all ten years and an average 833 hours in 2022, 2025 and 2028 are estimated when interim reports are due. Survey : The state will direct the CMOs to implement enrollee surveys on an annual basis as noted earlier . The evaluation budget includes staff time to assist DCH in evaluating the sampling design and implementation of the survey through the firm hired by the CM Os. Staff time is also included for the analysis of weighted survey data and 'themes' obtained from open -ended questions . An average of 289 hours annually for this task are estimated across all ten years but an average 276 hours in 2022, 2025 and 2028 are estimated when interim reports are due. Analysis and Report Preparation : A large amount of staff time is devoted to the development of analytic files to be used in statistical and regression -based analyses. Developing and cross -checking definitions of variables used for process and outcome measures included in the reporting process requires significant staff time especially for the proposed multivariate analyses. More staff time has been budgeted for those years in which Interim reports are due [2022, 2025 and 2028] . An average of 1496 hours annually for this task are estimated across all ten years but an average 1793 hours in 2022, 2025 and 2028 are estimated when interim reports are due. Project Management : The budget also includes 104 hours annual ly for the overall management of the evaluation and reporting process. Management tasks will largely include meetings, phone calls and other tasks to assure coordination of efforts to complete analysis and produce the scheduled reports in a timely manner .
