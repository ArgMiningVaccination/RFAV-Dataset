Diagnosing Your Lymphoma Lymphoma is a cancer that occurs when your body's white blood cells, called lymphocytes, begin behaving abnormally. Lymphocytes help you fight infection and are part of your lymphatic, or immune system. Lymphoma can affect any part of your lymphatic system, which is made up of lymphocytes, lymph nodes and vessels, the spleen and bone marrow. The two main types of lymphoma are: - Hodgkin lymphoma: one of the most curable blood cancers, but less common than non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: affects mostly adults and is one of the most common cancers in the United States. There are many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it may be slow growing (indolent) or fast growing (aggressive). Diagnosing your particular type of lymphoma is a crucial part of providing you with the right treatment. Diagnosis of lymphoma is done with a biopsy, which involves examination by a pathologist of tissue or cells obtained by removing all or part of a lymph node. Staging determines the extent of spread of the disease. A complete staging workup may include a physical exam, blood work, CT and/or PET scans, bone marrow biopsy, and sometimes a lumbar puncture. For patients with biopsies performed at outside facilities, the tissue samples are re-evaluated by Winship hematopathologists to confirm the diagnosis. Winship radiologists also may review CT and/or PET scans from outside facilities. Learn About Cancer For reliable, in-depth information about cancer symptoms, staging and diagnosis, visit [CancerQuest](http://www.cancerquest.org/patients), an educational and outreach program at Emory University. Your Treatment Options Depending on your diagnosis, the stage of your lymphoma and how your particular lymphoma developed, your treatment options may vary and may include: Chemotherapy: Each type of lymphoma is sensitive to different combinations of chemotherapy, which may involve one or a combination of anticancer drugs that destroy cancer cells. Stem Cell Transplantation: This treatment consists of destroying cancerous bone marrow cells using higher doses of chemotherapy and in some cases, radiotherapy, and then replacing them with healthy stem cells to help patients regain a new and healthy immune system. CAR T-cell Therapy: During treatment, a patient's white blood cells are removed from the body and genetically changed to recognize and kill cancerous cells. The re-engineered cells are then infused back into the patient. CAR T-cell therapy is currently being used at Winship for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas, including and follicular lymphoma. Winship's Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center has pioneered many advances in stem cell transplant and cellular therapy procedures and drugs. Targeted therapy: The use of monoclonal antibodies provided the first targeted therapy for lymphoma. Several are now routinely used to treat lymphoma. Some forms of lymphoma may also be treated with one therapy or a combination of radiation therapy, biologic therapy, and even surgery, primarily to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis. Supportive Oncology Care In addition to delivering the highest quality medical care, we recognize the importance of the psychological and emotional aspects of living with a cancer diagnosis and of dealing with treatment. Our [supportive oncology](../living-with-cancer/supportive-and-palliative-care.html) team addresses these issues in a timely manner with additional support from [counselors](../living-with-cancer/psychiatric-oncology.html), [nurse navigators](../living-with-cancer/nurse-navigators.html), [dietitians](../living-with-cancer/nutrition-services.html) and [social service](../living-with-cancer/social-services.html) professionals. Lymphoma Research One of your best options may be participation in a clinical trial. Our lymphoma patients have access to some of the most advanced cancer treatments and clinical trials offered anywhere. Consider talking with your doctor about participating in a clinical trial at Winship.
