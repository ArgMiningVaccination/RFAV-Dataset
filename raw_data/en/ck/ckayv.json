Administrative Office (No services offered at this location) 100 W. Houston St., 14th Floor San Antonio, Texas 78205 Phone 210-207-8780 Since its inception in 1994, Texas has participated in the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. Our version is called the Texas Vaccines for Children Program (TVFC). The Program was initiated by the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This legislation guaranteed vaccines would be available at no cost to providers, in order to immunize children (birth - 18 years of age) who meet the eligibility requirements. Today there are more than 3,000 Texas providers enrolled in TVFC, including more than 150 TVFC providers located in San Antonio and Bexar County. Texas leads the nation in the number of uninsured and underinsured children. We also have over 3 million Texas children on Medicaid (Federal Fiscal Year 2016 data). Many of these children are not receiving the complete series of immunizations required to protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases. By enrolling in TVFC, you can provide innumerable benefits to the families in your practice and to the people of Texas. One of the most important benefits is removing barriers to immunizations. For instance, you will no longer have to refer an uninsured child to a public health center for immunizations. TVFC removes the burden of the financial cost of vaccines, thereby eliminating the need to refer clients. Children are then kept in their \"medical home,\" which is beneficial to the provider and client. Families who are currently paying for vaccinations may be TVFC eligible. A fully immunized society is necessary to reach optimum eradication of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. With your help, we can reach these goals leading to a healthier Texas. We need your help in order to ensure the health and future of Texas children. If you are not enrolled in TVFC, please consider enrolling. The process is simple: Under TVFC, the following groups of children (birth - 18 years of age) should receive free vaccines: Phone: 210.207.3965 Email The Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program supplies publicly-purchased vaccine at no cost to enrolled providers. The program was created by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Immunization Unit to increase access to vaccination services in Texas for uninsured adults, thereby raising the immunization coverage levels and improving the health of Texans. We need your help in order to ensure a healthy Texas. If you are not enrolled in ASN, please consider enrolling. The process is simple: Under ASN, the following adults are eligible to receive vaccines (19 years of age or older): The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Immunization Unit has prepared the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) and Adult Safety Net (ASN) Provider Manual . Consultation on the policies in this manual are conducted routinely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), DSHS, and other organizations. The purpose of the TVFC and ASN Provider Manual is to consolidate TVFC policies and information into one source. You may consult the manual as needed, in particular for the handling and management of TVFC vaccines. Throughout the year, the DSHS Immunization Unit will announce new policies via official policy letters and memorandums. The Provider Manual will undergo a comprehensive review annually.
