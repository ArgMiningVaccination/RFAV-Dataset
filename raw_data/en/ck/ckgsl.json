Most COVID-19 mRNA vaccine studies have concentrated on post-immunization-humoral-response characterization.6-10 Alpha, Delta variant strains, and original Wuhan strain contributes an association between protection against COVID-19 and antibody (humoral) level, detected by previous Figure 1 a) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific CD4 + T cells at day 0 (blue), 21 (red), and 90 (brown) ( n = 286, 460, and 462, respectively). b) SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific CD8 + T cells at day 0 (blue), 21 (red), and 90 (brown) ( n = 272, 444, and 449, respectively).

DOI: 10.15406/jhvrv.2023.10.00263Conclusion In conclusion, overall cross-reactive T cell responses against different SARS-CoV-2-variants of concern (VOC) in both previously infected and infection-na\u00efve HCWs. For different VOC, COVID-19 booster vaccinations induce neutralizing antibody and strong T cell responses and the presence of T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 VOC indicate that vaccine-induced T cell immunity contributes cross- reactive protection.
