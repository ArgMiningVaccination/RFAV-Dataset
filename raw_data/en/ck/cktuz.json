One of the possible treatments for this pathology is a change in the type of diet, of which enteral nutrition (EN) is one. This study is to understand how the use of EN can affect the adult population diagnosed with IBD. We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and a meta-regression. On the different databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, LILACS, CINAHL, WOS), we found 363 registers with an accuracy of 12% (44 registers). After a full-text review, only 30 research studies were selected for qualitative synthesis and 11 for meta-analysis and meta-regression. The variables used were Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). EN has been shown to have efficacy for the treatment of Crohn's disease and is compatible with other medicines. As for the CDAI or rates of remission, there were no differences between enteral and parenteral nutrition. Polymeric formulas have shown better results with respect to the CRP. The long-term treatment could dilute the good CDAI results that are obtained at the start of the EN treatment.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-11-04", "cleaned_text": "[1](#B1-nutrients-11-02657)]. UC affects the large intestine and is generally observed as a superficial ulcer due to an inflammatory reaction localized to the mucosa and the submucosa. However, CD occurs all along the intestinal tract (from mouth to anus) and involves the entire intestinal layer [ [2](#B2-nutrients-11-02657)]. [3](#B3-nutrients-11-02657)]. As it is a chronic, incurable, and low-mortality disease, it is expected that the decrease of the global burden of the disease in the next decade will require a two-pronged solution that implies research on prevention interventions as well as innovations in the care of these patients [ [3](#B3-nutrients-11-02657), [4](#B4-nutrients-11-02657)]. [5](#B5-nutrients-11-02657)]. IBD can provoke various symptoms that include abdominal pain, low fever, fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea, bloody feces, etc. [ [6](#B6-nutrients-11-02657)]. [7](#B7-nutrients-11-02657), [8](#B8-nutrients-11-02657)]. Therefore, it can induce the expression of disease genes and determine the cell's phenotype and function in IBD [ [7](#B7-nutrients-11-02657), [8](#B8-nutrients-11-02657)]. One of the possible treatments for this pathology is a change in the type of diet [ [9](#B9-nutrients-11-02657)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-11-02657)]. Within the elemental formulas, different classes can be distinguished as a function of the nitrogen source: elemental formulas are based on amino acids, semi-elemental formulas are based on oligo-peptides, and polymeric formulas are based on whole proteins [ [11](#B11-nutrients-11-02657)]. [9](#B9-nutrients-11-02657), [12](#B12-nutrients-11-02657)]. Authors such as Guagnozzi et al. suggest that the interaction between the composition of specific dietary formulas or nutrients and IBD should be investigated to add new knowledge to the etiopathogenesis of the disease in nutritional intervention [ [13](#B13-nutrients-11-02657)]. 2. Materials and Methods [14](#B14-nutrients-11-02657)]. Afterward, a meta-analysis on the more common results and a meta-regression with the co-variables, type of enteral nutrition, and period of treatment, were conducted. 2.1. Systematic Review 2.1.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 2.1.2. Search Equation 2.1.3. Selection Process 2.1.4. Evaluation of the Quality of the Studies [15](#B15-nutrients-11-02657)]. This tool is structured into five domains through which bias might be introduced into the result: the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. For each study, the response options for an overall risk-of-bias judgement were \"low risk of bias\", \"some Meta-Regression [16](#B16-nutrients-11-02657)] On the x-axis, the contribution of each study to the overall heterogeneity statistic was plotted. On the y-axis, the standardized difference of the overall treatment effect with and without each study was plotted; this quantity describes the influence of each study on the overall treatment effect. Therefore, studies that fell in the top right quadrant of the Baujat plot had the most influence. [17](#B17-nutrients-11-02657)], based on the funnel-plot, estimating and adjusting for the number and outcomes of missing studies in the meta-analysis. Another less-conservative proposal to estimate the number and outcomes of missing studies was proposed by Copas et al. [ [18](#B18-nutrients-11-02657)]. [19](#B19-nutrients-11-02657)] and metasens version 0.4-0 1](#nutrients-11-02657-f001). [Figure 2](#nutrients-11-02657-f002)shows this information in a chronological manner. 3.2. Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression [Figure 5](#nutrients-11-02657-f005)shows the effect size of the use of EN. For the three indicators of disease, the effects were positive when comparing the situation at the start and finish of the treatment with EN independently, if the situation with fixed effects (less probable) or random effects (more acceptable) is considered. [Table 2](#nutrients-11-02657-t002), considering a model of random effects. [Figure 6](#nutrients-11-02657-f006)shows this influence through the Baujat plot. The numbers shown in the figure correspond to the articles shown in the table in the ID column. [Figure 7](#nutrients-11-02657-f007), where a lack of symmetry can be observed. Therefore, the non-parametric analysis proposed by Duval and Tweedie to analyze this asymmetry should show a lack of articles, and therefore a publication bias. The results of this non-parametric analysis for the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model are shown in [Table 3](#nutrients-11-02657-t003). These results show a possible publication bias in the three variables studied, if a fixed-effects model is assumed; however, the random-effects models did not show this bias. [Table 4](#nutrients-11-02657-t004). There was a dependence of the CDAI score with the period, losing efficacy in prolonged interventions (p < 0.05). The CRP showed better results in the EN when using polymeric formulas that were elemental (p < 0.001). 4. Discussion [50](#B50-nutrients-11-02657)], as shown by many of our results. Despite the lack of correlation between IBDQ and the CDAI, correlations were observed between both indexes starting at week 4 of the treatment. A study that focused on the gall bladder was even found, which showed its improvement after day 36 of treatment administration; therefore, aside from reducing the activity or inducing the remission of the disease, this diet could have beneficial effects on organs related with the digestive system [ [23](#B23-nutrients-11-02657), [25](#B25-nutrients-11-02657)]. [51](#B51-nutrients-11-02657)]. Different formulations exist, but the ones that do seem to have a positive effect on the maintenance and remission of the disease are elemental and polymeric diets [ [10](#B10-nutrients-11-02657), [22](#B22-nutrients-11-02657)]. The efficacy of an EN diet does not depend much on it being elemental or polymeric, as shown by some of our results [ [42](#B42-nutrients-11-02657), [44](#B44-nutrients-11-02657)], since, a priori, both have the same potential for inducing a remission [ [32](#B32-nutrients-11-02657), [39](#B39-nutrients-11-02657), [46](#B46-nutrients-11-02657)]. However, the meta-regression conducted indicated that a polymeric diet could decrease the CRP better than an elemental one. Additionally, a distinction could be made between them when looking at the economic burden entailed by the use of one or the other and the acceptability by the patients, meaning that, in the adherence to the dietary treatment, the polymeric ones tend to be more accepted by the patients, as they are better tasting [ [52](#B52-nutrients-11-02657), [53](#B53-nutrients-11-02657)]. The elemental foods are less tolerated with mouth feeding, and generally require a nasogastric tube, which entails complications and patient discomfort. In contrast, the polymeric EN is more tolerable through the mouth by patients, making it the first option for the ill [ [33](#B33-nutrients-11-02657), [54](#B54-nutrients-11-02657)]. [55](#B55-nutrients-11-02657)], while others did not show any effect [ [56](#B56-nutrients-11-02657)] or less beneficial effects [ [29](#B29-nutrients-11-02657)]. Despite what has been said, some studies have suggested that an EN high in fats could improve gastrointestinal motility and improve the ilium after an operation [ [57](#B57-nutrients-11-02657)], reducing damage to the intestinal mucosa barrier and the underlying mechanism that could be associated with its antioxidant action after surgical intervention [ [58](#B58-nutrients-11-02657)]. [59](#B59-nutrients-11-02657)], seem to improve the disease's symptoms. Just as shown by our results, EN combined with other types of pharmaceuticals such as prednisone, corticosteroids, and sulfasalazines show a significantly continuous high rate of remission [ [41](#B41-nutrients-11-02657), [60](#B60-nutrients-11-02657)]. On the other hand, the combination of EN with steroids does not seem to have significant differences in the probability of a relapse [ [40](#B40-nutrients-11-02657)], perhaps because the steroids do not address the damage produced in the intestinal mucosa, which is the greatest predictor of complications over time [ [61](#B61-nutrients-11-02657), [62](#B62-nutrients-11-02657)]. [63](#B63-nutrients-11-02657)]. This is perhaps the reason why significant differences were not found in a study conducted by Gasull et al. in 2001 that utilized two polymeric EN formulas, with the response being similar in both [ [30](#B30-nutrients-11-02657)]. Additionally, in another study conducted with two polymeric formulas for five weeks, a significant relationship was not found between the treatment with different EN and the changes produced at the level of the disease's activity [ [37](#B37-nutrients-11-02657)]. [36](#B36-nutrients-11-02657)]. The mechanism of action of the semi-elemental diet could be multifunctional, just like as the elemental one, decreasing the intestinal permeability and thus decreasing the loss of fluid. The semi-elemental diet could also reduce the commensal intestinal bacteria that play a role in intestinal inflammation [ [64](#B64-nutrients-11-02657), [65](#B65-nutrients-11-02657)]. Thus, the use of these types of diets is advisable, either with the use of an elemental or semi-elemental formula for the management of different gastro-intestinal disorders [ [66](#B66-nutrients-11-02657)]. [24](#B24-nutrients-11-02657)] found significant differences between groups subjected to EEN and EN plus an oral diet, although it is interesting to note how the patients refer to a greater subjective well-being when they take EN together with the oral diet when compared to those who are not treated with supplemented EN, despite the biochemical parameters being very similar [ [21](#B21-nutrients-11-02657), [49](#B49-nutrients-11-02657)]. Some studies suggest that a partial enteral nutrition supplemented with different diets such as Mono-saccharides and Polyols) could be beneficial for UC and CD [ [25](#B25-nutrients-11-02657), [32](#B32-nutrients-11-02657)], although larger controlled assays are needed to back their use [ [67](#B67-nutrients-11-02657)]. Even patients who were subjected to EN before their operation experienced benefits, not only in their nutritional state, but also with a reduction of inflammation in their disease [ [68](#B68-nutrients-11-02657)], with patients also experiencing improvements after said intervention [ [27](#B27-nutrients-11-02657)]. [53](#B53-nutrients-11-02657)]. However, the meta-regression from our study showed an inverse relationship between the period of treatment with EN and the improvement shown through the CDAI, that foreseeably, the patients who are subjected to prolonged EN could stop noticing its benefits. [53](#B53-nutrients-11-02657)], but it is important to know which EN formulas can be used to boost their anti-inflammatory effects, as there is evidence that supplementary EN is not sufficient for inducing remission, so that it would have to be used exclusively to be able to obtain its anti-inflammatory effect [ [69](#B69-nutrients-11-02657), [70](#B70-nutrients-11-02657)]. At present, it is well-established that EEN has a strong anti-inflammatory effect with a reduction in the systemic and mucosa inflammatory parameters in a few days, however, the EEN as a long-term therapy is still a challenge, given its lack of palatability and the lack of data to analyze the efficiency of EEN as a maintenance diet [ [71](#B71-nutrients-11-02657)]. [72](#B72-nutrients-11-02657)]. As for the debate about which is healthier, EN or PN, our results showed that there are studies in which the effectiveness of both seems to be significantly the same for the improvement of the CDAI [ [45](#B45-nutrients-11-02657), [48](#B48-nutrients-11-02657)]. Bearing in mind that the dietary antigens could be important stimulants for the immune system of the mucosa, intestinal rest with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is considered as the main option for achieving this rest and for correcting possible nutritional deficits [ [73](#B73-nutrients-11-02657)]; however when compared to the EN, it does not seem to provide greater benefits. In fact, in one of the studies included in our review [ [47](#B47-nutrients-11-02657)], EN was the one that seemed to provide the greatest benefits to the patients and to reduce the costs, personal as well as economic, of the different dietary treatments [ [74](#B74-nutrients-11-02657)]. [75](#B75-nutrients-11-02657), [76](#B76-nutrients-11-02657)]. 5.
