However, given the gravity of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, there has been much debate as to the value of traditional healing in this respect. Accordingly, this paper explores the extent to which meaningful accommodation between the biomedical and traditional sectors is possible (and/or even desirable). It does this through a consideration of Native American and South African experiences, looking at how the respective groups, in which medical pluralism is common, have addressed the issue of HIV/AIDS. The paper points to the importance of developing \"culturally appropriate\" forms of treatment that emphasise complementary rather than adversarial engagement between the traditional and biomedical systems and how policymakers can best facilitate this.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2015-04-20", "cleaned_text": "Traditional Healing, Biomedicine and the Treatment of HIV/AIDS: Contrasting South African and Native American Health in Native American and South African Societies [2](#B2-ijerph-12-04321)]. Likewise, in the U.S., Native American life expectancy is lower than that of the national average, and Native American communities also demonstrate \"lower health status\" in a number of areas. The IHS notes: \"American Indians and Alaska Natives die at higher rates than other Americans from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (368% higher), diabetes mellitus (177% (82% higher), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (59% higher).\" [3](#B3-ijerph-12-04321)]. In both regions, poverty, inadequate nutrition, high levels of violent crime, alcohol and substance abuse, and poor access to healthcare are all contributing factors, many of which can be seen to stem from colonial legacies. [4](#B4-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. xxiii). This is despite a marked improvement in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts and treatment in recent years. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has also had a significant impact on Native American communities, although relatively small numbers make this impact less visible. Official statistics suggest that Native Americans are the third worst affected ethnic group in America, after African Americans and Hispanics. However, given the manner in which all people entered into the U.S. health system are (mis)classified ethnically, it is arguable that there may be significant under-reporting of the problem [ [5](#B5-ijerph-12-04321)]. Furthermore, while prevalence rates are declining amongst other U.S. ethnic groups, they are continuing to rise amongst Native Americans. Evidence also shows that Native Americans infected with HIV have shorter life expectancies than those in other ethnic groups [ [6](#B6-ijerph-12-04321)]. 3. Method: Establishing a Framework for South contrast South African experiences. The IHS, too, is a repository for documentation detailing debates over policymaking and accommodation with respect to traditional forms of healing employed within formal healthcare structures ( [http://www.ihs.gov/](http://www.ihs.gov/)). [15](#B15-ijerph-12-04321), [16](#B16-ijerph-12-04321), Healing [21](#B21-ijerph-12-04321)]) and South African [ [22](#B22-ijerph-12-04321)] traditional healthcare perspectives, aspects of both systems have proved remarkably durable. While both of the regions concerned incorporate a number of cultural/ethnic groups that are hardly homogenous, there are sufficient commonalities across each to make at least a degree of generalisation useful. For example, while there are an estimated 4.1 million Native Americans living in the U.S., comprising 566 government-recognised tribes [ [3](#B3-ijerph-12-04321)], healers from the different groups borrow extensively from each other (although some traditional healers, like the high profile 'medicine man' and civil rights activist John Lame Deer, have expressed concern about the amalgamation of Native American beliefs; Lame Deer has argued that, for himself at least, it was important to concentrate on his specifically Sioux traditions [ [9](#B9-ijerph-12-04321)]). Similarly, in South Africa, despite there being 11 official languages and a host of often-overlapping identities, traditional healers from across the country\u2014and as far afield as Nigeria and Uganda\u2014are accepted as \"legitimate\" by local communities [ [1](#B1-ijerph-12-04321)]. [23](#B23-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. xx). Claims that Native American healing has been practiced for 12,000 years (or longer, depending on when the Americas were first inhabited), intentionally or not cement this perspective [ [24](#B24-ijerph-12-04321)]. It is accepted that the cataclysm wrought by infectious diseases introduced to the Americas after 1492 impacted dramatically upon the social and cultural fabric of Native American societies. Depopulation estimates range between 78 and 97 percent of the pre-Columbian population of North America [ [24](#B24-ijerph-12-04321)] (pp. 324-325). By the late nineteenth century only approximately 500,000 Native Americans remained out of a pre-1492 population that may have been as high as 18 million [ [24](#B24-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 325). By extension, this undermines severely any argument that twenty-first century Native American traditions represent 12,000 years of continuity. The origins of pre-colonial South African forms of healing are similarly clouded. However, while generally conservative and rooted in the past, the traditional healing practiced today in both regions has not gone unchanged over the centuries. All systems evolve and traditional healing is no different in this respect. Colonialism engendered additional complications; knowledge and traditions have eroded in the face of centuries of instability and conflict to the point that it is difficult to say with any certainty that what is practised currently would have been recognisable to pre-colonial societies. [25](#B25-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 387). In a number of respects, Last's observations can be seen to hold when applied to other systems of traditional healing. Contemporary Native American practitioners like Lewis Mehl-Madrona\u2014a qualified biomedical doctor as well as a traditional healer\u2014acknowledge the fact that much of what is practiced by current healers is drawn from different sources and often based largely on \"intuition\" [ [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321)]. For Mehl-Madrona, \"modern shamans...pick and choose bits of different traditions, using a combination of things that work for them and their clients\" [ [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 135). [26](#B26-ijerph-12-04321)]. In terms of basic observances for example, peyote ceremonies usually take place in tipis even though such structures were not traditionally employed by groups of significant size like the Navajo [ [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321)]. The sweat lodge too, long viewed as a universal symbol of Native American healing (and one embraced by New Age healers), and now also incorporated as a ceremony within the Native American church, was not historically utilised by all groups. Traditional South African forms of healing have similarly seen changes, particularly in urban areas. The list of industrial ingredients found in many traditional remedies would, of course, have been wholly unknown in pre-colonial societies [ [27](#B27-ijerph-12-04321), [28](#B28-ijerph-12-04321)]. Engagement with healers from other parts of Africa also represents an evolution of traditional perspectives [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. [30](#B30-ijerph-12-04321), [31](#B31-ijerph-12-04321)]). This figure was also employed with specific respect to South Africa in the South African Medical Journal in 2012 [ [32](#B32-ijerph-12-04321)]. In 2011, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa put the figure at 70 percent [ [33](#B33-ijerph-12-04321)]. While this particular statistic is something of a \"factoid\", the controversy surrounding it should not be allowed to undermine the importance placed on traditional healing in Sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, the more considered evidence suggests a far lower but nonetheless significant proportion of adherents [ [34](#B34-ijerph-12-04321)]. Similarly, with respect to Native Americans, figures for those making use of traditional healing range between 38 and 70 percent [ [35](#B35-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 670). 5. Science and the Supernatural: Distinguishing between Healthcare Systems [36](#B36-ijerph-12-04321), [37](#B37-ijerph-12-04321)]. The reality is that practitioners and patients on both sides \"dip into\" the alternatives available to them; meaningful engagement can take place when the need arises. As Stoner has also demonstrated, what people want, with respect to healthcare, are options, irrespective of how these may be defined. [10](#B10-ijerph-12-04321)], Mohatt [ [13](#B13-ijerph-12-04321)] and Langley [ [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321)] all record conversations with healers freshly discharged from their local hospitals. [38](#B38-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 22). As Ackerknecht saw it, healers were \"ancestor[s] of the priest\" rather than of the modern biomedical practitioner. In colonial Africa, \"witchdoctors\" were dismissed as being representative of the \"dark continent\" that colonialism sought to displace [ [39](#B39-ijerph-12-04321)]. [40](#B40-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 577). Moreover, although attempting to quantify the impact of prayer on those who are sick is methodologically controversial, evidence from a small number of randomised tests suggests that it may be possible to identify a positive effect. A study focusing on coronary patients in the U.S. \"found that supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients...further studies using validated and standardized outcome measures and variations in prayer strategy are warranted to explore the potential role of prayer as an adjunct to standard medical care\" [ [41](#B41-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 2278). [42](#B42-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 357). The authors argued that \"science does not require a known mechanism to prove the existence of a phenomenon...for years no one knew how colchicine, morphine, aspirin, or quinine worked, yet they were known to be effective\" [ [42](#B42-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 362). [43](#B43-ijerph-12-04321)]. Critically, as an extension, the majority of patients also see no conflict in requesting supernatural intercession whilst being treated within a healthcare framework that offers no ontological space for the supernatural. 6. Biomedical and Traditional Perspectives: Establishing Common Ground? [23](#B23-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. xx). Rather, these examples of traditional healing form alternative systems of healthcare. In both instances, unlike in the pathology-focussed biomedical model, traditional forms of healing rely heavily on aspects of the supernatural with respect to both diagnosis and treatment [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321), [44](#B44-ijerph-12-04321)]. Here, the terms \"healer\" and \"medicine\" extend more broadly than they do within the general biomedical paradigm. A group of male Lakota healers, when questioned as to how they should be formally identified, after rejecting the terms \"medicine man\", \"holy man\" and \"interpreter (for the spirits)\", finally settled on a term that translates as \"the this study told of a similar \"calling\": from childhood, vivid and disquieting dreams in which their ancestors tried to establish lines of communication with them [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. Many, although not all [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)], who come to the profession are either illiterate or have had little formal schooling [ [9](#B9-ijerph-12-04321), [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321)], and much of their \"power\" is derived from the strength of their relationships with the \"spirit world\" and/or their ancestors. Consequently, while forms of what might equate to biomedicine are practiced by traditional herbalists [ [38](#B38-ijerph-12-04321)] who utilise plants to treat ailments, most medicines and treatments are \"revealed\" through supernatural engagement [ [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321), [13](#B13-ijerph-12-04321), [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. [15](#B15-ijerph-12-04321), [38](#B38-ijerph-12-04321)]. In both traditions it is witchcraft that is understood to play an often central role in the causation of illness. As a result, illness is rarely viewed as transmittable; witchcraft is nearly always person- (or, occasionally, family-) specific [ [10](#B10-ijerph-12-04321), [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321), [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. The invoking of witchcraft, as perceived across both cultures, generally originates out of jealousy and a desire to see a successful person brought low. Witchcraft is understood to bring about general misfortune, financial problems, alcohol and/or substance abuse, relationship and personal issues, and, critically, ill health. As a number of informants contributing to this study detailed, bad luck is, essentially, no matter of chance; both good and bad fortune are shaped by the supernatural [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. Resolution of bad fortune, therefore, is also understood to require supernatural intervention, usually invoked through ceremonies and rituals. Medication, if required, is determined on the basis of supernatural direction rather than pharmaceutical benefit\u2014for example, the smoking of blessed cigarettes is a common prescription within Native American healing [ [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321), [47](#B47-ijerph-12-04321)]. [48](#B48-ijerph-12-04321)]). However, attempts by both policymakers and the biomedical community to codify what is and what is not traditional healing reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is and how it is practiced. For example, the idea of charlatan healers sits uncomfortably within both cultures\u2014in general, failure to find a cure is often viewed as an indication not of fraudulence or misdiagnosis on the part of the traditional healer, but rather of the strength of the supernatural forces aligned against the patient. In such cases, it thus becomes a matter of seeking out a more powerful healer. In South Africa, it tends to be understood that \"genuine\" healers will only request payment once the patient is healed. A healer demanding payment upfront may sometimes be deemed suspect [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. [49](#B49-ijerph-12-04321)]). While the utility of this dichotomy is much debated, it tends to be the case that biomedicine is focused on the curing of disease while traditional healing is inclined to be more concerned with illness. In basic terms, the two systems are not necessarily attempting to achieve the same goals or outcomes, which can be confusing to outsiders, particularly given that the language used to describe both processes is often seemingly interchangeable. In part this is due to the fact that the lexicons of traditional cosmologies often translate poorly into English (and other European languages), resulting in the obscuring of major epistemological divides. When traditional approaches are described in English terms, with the biomedical associations of the latter, it can create illusions\u2014if not aspirations\u2014of equivalence: in English, many traditional healers themselves reach for what is largely biomedical terminology in order to describe their work to outsiders. Traditional healers marketing themselves in urban South Africa often adopt the titles \"doctor\" or \"professor\". They routinely receive their patients in offices, with waiting rooms staffed by receptionists, in much the same way as biomedical general practitioners would. However, as Waldram points out, traditional healers' interpretations of biomedical terminology are rarely considered [ [49](#B49-ijerph-12-04321)]. 7. The Advantages of Traditional Healing for Patients [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321)]. This is by no means unusual within biomedicine; doctor-patient interaction is generally kept to a minimum. The UK National Health Service (NHS) suggests that a GP will see, on average, between thirty and forty patients per day [ [50](#B50-ijerph-12-04321)]. In Native American and South African communities, where biomedical healthcare personnel and infrastructure can both be limited, practitioner-patient \"face time\" can be somewhat perfunctory. The resultant feelings of alienation and frustration experienced by patients under these circumstances can be exacerbated when practitioners are unable to engage patients in their own languages. Traditional healers, on the other hand, tend to spend a great deal of time with their patients, with some Native American ceremonies extending across a number of days [ [10](#B10-ijerph-12-04321), [12](#B12-ijerph-12-04321), [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321)]. Some intensive therapies have been known to involve daily contact between healer and patient for over a month [ [13](#B13-ijerph-12-04321)]. Amongst the Navajo, complex ceremonies can involve up to a hundred hours of ritual chanting on the part of the healer, and can also require the participation of the patient's entire extended family [ [51](#B51-ijerph-12-04321)]. In fact, what stands out when comparing the two systems, is that traditional healing, unlike that of biomedicine, is often communal rather than private. In all cases, patients are asked to be part of the process in the interests of contributing to their own healing. Furthermore, due to the ways in which the supernatural is perceived to impact on people's health, treatments and ceremonies are tailored to the requirements of individuals, as is any prescribed medication [ [11](#B11-ijerph-12-04321)]. Likewise, traditional forms of healing in South Africa are unhurried and deeply personalised, with treatment being specifically tailored to each individual [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. South African traditional healers see far fewer patients than their biomedical counterparts, offering in-depth treatment that includes counselling for both individual patients and their families [ [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321)]. South African traditional healers, like their Native American counterparts, also frequently travel significant distances to treat patients in their own homes [ [52](#B52-ijerph-12-04321)]. Traditional healing is therefore a highly individualised and interactive experience for patients, in which healers are facilitators. This differs substantially from the expert-driven approach central to biomedicine. [53](#B53-ijerph-12-04321)]. As with biomedical practitioners, traditional healers identify what is wrong with their patients\u2014the naming of the illness presented is viewed as a significant aspect of the treatment process. In this respect, the divergence between the systems occurs on the basis of the significance surrounding a patient's experience of ill health that is offered by traditional healing. In contrast, biomedicine has little to offer patients in terms of explanations for their misfortune\u2014diseases are contracted randomly (at least in part) against the background of a largely disinterested universe. In this respect, a \"witchcraft paradigm\" [ [16](#B16-ijerph-12-04321), [17](#B17-ijerph-12-04321)] offers a degree of solace to patients; their suffering can be seen to have been caused by malevolent forces deployed against them, usually out of jealousy, rather than having come about through random infections and mutations. Jealousy-as-causation was a recurring theme within the majority of the discussions on witchcraft that arose during this study, with both patients and healers in broad agreement on this aspect [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. At the same time, within such a worldview, it must be emphasised that for every victim of witchcraft there must be a perpetrator [ [10](#B10-ijerph-12-04321), [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321), [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]. Instances of retaliation\u2014often violent\u2014against \"witches\" by communities in South Africa are well documented [ [54](#B54-ijerph-12-04321)]. In 1995, as a result of nearly 150 deaths the preceding year in Northern Province, South Africa, a commission of inquiry was established to investigate witchcraft-related murders [ [55](#B55-ijerph-12-04321)]. In 2007, in response to similar levels of violence, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, passed the Witchcraft Suppression Bill that made the identifying or \"sniffing out\" of witches a criminal offence. While there is less documented detail regarding the negative social effects of a witchcraft paradigm on Native American communities, retribution\u2014usually supernatural\u2014is often implied [ [10](#B10-ijerph-12-04321), [14](#B14-ijerph-12-04321)]. 8. Bringing the Traditional and Biomedical Sectors Closer Together [56](#B56-ijerph-12-04321)]. In this regard, the first director of the IHS, appointed in 1953, James \"Ray\" Shaw, saw improving ties with traditional healers as an important aspect of the agency's mission [ [57](#B57-ijerph-12-04321)]. Once established, the relationship between the IHS and traditional healers became (to a degree) reflexive. For example, the head of mental health services for the IHS in the 1970s, Robert Bergman, describes the establishment, by Navajo healers, of a \"school for medicine men\" in which he taught classes on biomedical practice and psychiatry and was, in turn, moved to refer his own patients to local traditional healers [ [51](#B51-ijerph-12-04321)]. Fostering cooperation has remained an important part of the IHS mission, especially in the wake of the 1976 Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which offered a far greater degree of self-determination to Native American communities with respect to the running of the IHS, and the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which afforded protection for Native American religious beliefs. Reflecting on the impact of the Act in 1994, an IHS policy paper stated that: \"The Indian Health Service (IHS) recognizes the value of traditional beliefs, ceremonies, and practices in the healing of body, mind, and spirit. The IHS encourages a climate of respect and acceptance in which traditional beliefs are honored as a healing and harmonizing force within individual lives, a vital support for purposeful living, and an integral component of the healing process. It is the policy of the IHS to facilitate access to traditional medicine practices, thereby protecting the right of American Indian and Alaska Native people to their beliefs and health practices as defined by the tribe's or village's traditional culture\".[ [58]] [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321), [59](#B59-ijerph-12-04321)]. Studies, from as far back as the 1952 Many Farms project targeting tuberculosis amongst Navajo communities, suggest that patients could be persuaded to undergo simultaneous biomedical and traditional treatments, on the basis of what was accepted as the complementary potential of a combined approach [ [56](#B56-ijerph-12-04321), [60](#B60-ijerph-12-04321)]. Contemporary Native American healers themselves relate how they use their powers to assist biomedical practitioners in their work, of which an example might be invoking their spirit guides to work with surgeons in operating theatres [ [13](#B13-ijerph-12-04321)]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that, with respect to biomedical regimes, self-compliance remains unaffected by consultation with traditional healers [ [59](#B59-ijerph-12-04321)]. [59](#B59-ijerph-12-04321)]. The South African situation is similar. South African biomedical care, although often limited in rural areas, is free; intensive traditional treatments, often requiring animal sacrifices, can currently cost as much as R5000 ($470) [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)], when the average unskilled wage is just R10 ($1) per hour. [61](#B61-ijerph-12-04321)]\u2014the IHS' remit means that it can offer a more tailored response to its patients than that which is available in South Africa. Like the IHS, the South African healthcare system is underfunded and understaffed. Critically, the South African system is also less flexible in its approach. As a national healthcare provider serving a population of 54 million [ [62](#B62-ijerph-12-04321)], it is in many respects unsurprising that IHS-style engagement between the biomedical and traditional healthcare sectors has had little space in which to evolve. In South Africa's case, while gradual change is now beginning to take place, the relationship between biomedical and traditional practitioners remains one governed largely by misunderstanding. That this climate exists is due at least in part to the fact that no institution along the lines of the IHS is present in South Africa. In the IHS, as an institution geared specifically to the treatment of a far smaller group of people drawn from a relatively common cultural background, the potential for accommodation between the sectors has been far greater. [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321)]. Traditional healers outnumber biomedical practitioners by almost 10:1 [ [1](#B1-ijerph-12-04321)]). Affording equivalence to the traditional sector was seized on by policymakers as a way of killing two birds with one stone. [23](#B23-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 26). Furthermore, during the early days of the pandemic, when mass South African access to the new biomedical response that was ART was a remote possibility, those who were HIV-positive sought out alternative treatment regimes, many of which included forms of traditional healing. Corinne Squire's \"narrative approach\" to understanding the pandemic in South Africa highlights how, during the Mbeki period, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) set about supporting themselves through the construction of their own AIDS narratives [ [63](#B63-ijerph-12-04321)]. [64](#B64-ijerph-12-04321)]. The subsequent 2008 Traditional Health Practitioners Act ignited significant discussion on, amongst other issues, the rights of traditional healers to write legally-valid \"sick notes\" for workers, and whether patients could claim for traditional healing expanses on their medical insurance [ [32](#B32-ijerph-12-04321)]. Albeit for different reasons, Mbeki's successor, Jacob Zuma, whose popularity rests at least in part on his staunch support of traditional values, has maintained emphasis on the continued mainstreaming of traditional healing: \"(o)ur commitment as government is to bring traditional medicine into the mainstream of health care, appropriately, effectively and above all safely\" [ [33](#B33-ijerph-12-04321)]. [1](#B1-ijerph-12-04321)]. For example, while traditional healers have been strongly encouraged to press patients they suspect of being HIV-positive to be tested, and many have expressed themselves content to do so [ [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321), [65](#B65-ijerph-12-04321)], surveys suggest that biomedical practitioners are, on the other hand, reluctant to recommend traditional healers to patients [ [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321)]. South African interaction is, in effect, the \"education\" of traditional healers into the biomedical perspective, rather than a \"meeting of minds\". 9. Traditional Healing and the Treatment of HIV/AIDS [29](#B29-ijerph-12-04321)]; for this reason, levels of HIV/AIDS education remain unacceptably low [ [23](#B23-ijerph-12-04321), [66](#B66-ijerph-12-04321)]. [49](#B49-ijerph-12-04321)]. The indisputable success of ART has made the case for biomedical treatment irrefutable. With PLWHA increasingly able to live into old age so long as they have adequate treatment, the importance of engaging with ART cannot be overemphasised. This, however, reduces dramatically the scope for patients to engage in medical pluralism. Traditional approaches cannot treat HIV/AIDS. This not to say that that traditional healing cannot have a positive effect on the conditions and symptoms affecting PLWHA\u2014especially with respect to efforts to assign meaning to suffering\u2014but attempts to suggest that comparable efficacy is a matter of interpretation is problematic. The human cost in not engaging with biomedical HIV/AIDS treatment is both high and undeniable; researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health suggest that, as a result of the South African government's failure to roll out ART between 2000 and 2005, \"more than 330,000 lives or approximately 2.2 million person years were lost\" [ [67](#B67-ijerph-12-04321)]. The same study estimated that during this period 35,000 babies acquired HIV via mother-to-child transmission, something that might have been averted through the administration of the ARV nevirapine [ [67](#B67-ijerph-12-04321)]. Of equal concern is evidence published in the journal AIDS in 2006 that pointed to low levels of awareness of appropriate HIV/AIDS treatments amongst South Africans [ [66](#B66-ijerph-12-04321)]. It was clear from this study that many South Africans viewed ART as simply one of a number of HIV/AIDS treatment options. The authors of the study argued strongly that \"if antiretroviral agents are to compete more successfully in the therapeutic continuum, there needs to be explicit recognition of, and further strategies to counter, the attraction of alternative therapies for patients and the systematic promotion these treatments receive\" [ [66](#B66-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. 1977). While the Zuma government has been far more forthcoming with respect to addressing the pandemic than its predecessor, it is clear that serious confusion remains with respect to HIV/AIDS. The fact that a 2014 report shows that, two decades after the democratic transition, South African prevalence rates continue to rise as a result of, in part, an estimated 469,000 new infections in 2012 (the year of the study) alone, suggests that the pandemic shows little sign of easing [ [4](#B4-ijerph-12-04321)] (p. xxix). [68](#B68-ijerph-12-04321)]. Groups like the Navajo AIDS Network (NAN), a non-profit organisation that works with the IHS, have established structures that allow for culturally-appropriate systems of treatment for PLWHA, including traditional healing. One of the services offered by the NAN helps PLWHA identify and fund treatment with traditional healers. At the same time, a notable outcome of the programme has been increased adherence to biomedical regimes [ [69](#B69-ijerph-12-04321)]. What is clear, in this instance, is that traditional healing is not being proffered as an alternative to ART. Rather, it is seen as a vehicle for both the provision of culturally-sensitive forms of HIV/AIDS education and the encouragement of prevention behaviours. Where South Africa is concerned, traditional remedies are frequently prescribed by healers as ART alternatives. One of the more publicised of such cases was that of Zeblon Gwala and his uBhejane (rhino) herbal \"cure\", which developed a devoted following in KwaZulu-Natal in 2006, the South African province with the highest levels of HIV/AIDS in the country. Gwala, a truck driver turned traditional healer, claimed that the treatment was revealed to him in a dream by his late grandfather who had, in turn, also been a traditional healer [ [70](#B70-ijerph-12-04321)]. In promoting his remedy, he claimed that it \"increases your CD4 count and reduces the viral load until it disappears\" [ [71](#B71-ijerph-12-04321)]. Critically, Gwala also advised all patients taking his treatment to discontinue ART. An additional concern to AIDS campaign groups was that Gwala received active support from, amongst others, Mbeki's Minister of Health, Mantombazana Tshabalala-Msimang and other political elites. When subjected to clinical trials in 2005, the Medical University of South Africa found uBhejane to have no positive effect on the treatment of HIV/AIDS [ [72](#B72-ijerph-12-04321)]. AIDS activists argued strongly that official support for uBhejane (along with other traditional treatments), created confusion in the minds of South Africans as to the value of ART [ [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321), [73](#B73-ijerph-12-04321)]. [74](#B74-ijerph-12-04321)]. Much of the training that has occurred has been left to NGOs. This is problematic; evidence suggests that many traditional healers remain poorly informed about HIV/AIDS. A study published in the South African Medical Journal in 2004 estimated that only 6.25 percent of traditional healers had undergone government-funded HIV/AIDS awareness training [ [74](#B74-ijerph-12-04321)]. Furthermore, where government training has been provided, the results have, at times, been disappointing, with significant numbers of healers still professing a belief that HIV/AIDS can be cured [ [46](#B46-ijerph-12-04321)]. Additional studies have also pointed to the continuation of HIV/AIDS risk-associated practices, such as the use of unsterilized equipment for the administering of enemas and the use of single blades for the scarification of multiple patients [ [75](#B75-ijerph-12-04321)]. That said, the South African Medical Journal study showed that traditional healers were increasingly demonstrating a willingness to promote condom usage and to stress the dangers of unprotected sex with multiple partners [ [74](#B74-ijerph-12-04321)]. 10. Conclusions [23](#B23-ijerph-12-04321)]; it is only the abandoning of the contemporary emphasis on syncretism that will enable further progression towards a viable form of accommodation. The identification of biomedical equivalence, double-blind clinical trials, and attempts at the codification of traditional healing (and traditional medicine) and its best practice, misses the point. For its proponents, the value of traditional healing lies elsewhere. In essence, the evaluation of traditional healing within an assessment framework that is itself a product of the evolution of the biomedical sector condemns the traditional sector from the outset; its practice will always be viewed by stakeholders within the formal healthcare sector as, at best, misinformed. Open acknowledgement of the integral aspects of much traditional healing that are, at present, downplayed in the interests of shoring up its position within a biomedical framework\u2014that it is not \"rational\", that it is not based on scientific principles, and that it is not falsifiable\u2014represent, somewhat counter-intuitively, the best means of bringing the sectors closer together.
