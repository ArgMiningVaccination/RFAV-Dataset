The essential difference between naturopathic doctors (NDs) and medical doctors (MDs), can best be summed up with this analogy: The \"check engine\" light in your car comes on, so you take it to a mechanic to find out what's wrong. Your mechanic claims to have solved the problem by cutting the wire that leads to the light. \"But cutting the wire didn't solve the real problem of what's wrong with my car. I need to know WHY the check engine light came on.\" We demand the best care for our cars; yet, as patients, we often calmly accept treatment that attempts to address symptoms, but not the root causes. Like the \"check engine\" light, symptoms are our bodies' warning lights alerting us to a deeper problem. As a naturopathic doctor and graduate of an accredited four-year naturopathic medical school, Dr. Crystal Abernathy is trained to uncover the underlying problems and treat them safely with natural non-toxic therapies and nutrition. This holistic approach removes toxins, corrects imbalances and unleashes your body's natural healing force. SERVICES OFFERED NATUROPATHIC CONSULTATION One of the most dramatic differences between an appointment with most medical doctors and naturopathic doctors is the amount of time spent listening and talking to you, the patient. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Testing is an important part of our comprehensive naturopathic treatment services. After your three-hour initial consultation, Dr. Abernathy may recommend one or more specific tests to determine the presence of imbalances, toxins and deficiencies in your body that could be causing your symptoms.
