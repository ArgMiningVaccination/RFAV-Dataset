Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy The Civil Service Reform Plan made a number of commitments to improve policy making including ensuring Civil Servants working on policy have the necessary skills and expertise, can use up to date tools and techniques and have a clear understanding of what works in practice. Looking at policy through a wellbeing lens offers a fresh perspective . Improving subjective wellbeing (SWB) is a worthy goal in its own right and can be instrumental to other outcomes - physical health, getting into work and productivity. SWB can be improved through marginal changes to policies and services e.g. increasing compassion and kindness in hospitals. This means we can build wellbeing into a wide range of policies and services. A wellbeing perspective facilitates: Innovation Earlier intervention/prevention Joined up policies and services For (social) policy makers in Whitehall subjective wellbeing will be most relevant to decision-making and provide the greatest source of policy innovation - along with other relevant objective wellbeing measures The Wellbeing Toolkit includes a range of exercises developed by the Cabinet Office: Stakeholder Wellbeing Analysis Time and Adaptation Analysis Wellbeing Drivers Analysis Policy Stretch Analysis Quick Wins Checklist We have applied the toolkit in a small number of areas so far, including: Which may ultimately reduce the healthcare burden Improved wellbeing and improved health outcomes A policy focus on wellbeing can lead to....

Definition Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Wellbeing is about feeling good and functioning well and comprises an individual's experience of their life; and a comparison of life circumstances with social norms and values. Wellbeing exists in two dimensions: Subjective wellbeing (or personal wellbeing) asks people directly how they think and feel about their own wellbeing, and includes aspects such as life satisfaction (evaluation), positive emotions (hedonic), and whether their life is meaningful (eudemonic). Objective wellbeing is based on assumptions about basic human needs and rights, including aspects such as adequate food, physical health, education, safety etc. Objective wellbeing can be measured through self -report (e.g., asking people whether they have a specific health condition), or through more objective measures (e.g., mortality rates and life expectancy). Measurement The Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) A validated measure of mental wellbeing that has been used, among other things, to assess the impact of health interventions on individual wellbeing and to track the mental wellbeing of the nation through the ONS 'Wheel of Wellbeing' Healthy life expectancy at birth Subjective reports of health Percentage who report a long term illness or disability Percentage who were somewhat, mostly or completely satisfied with their health Percentage with some evidence indicating probable psychological disturbance or mental ill health (GHQ 12) 'The ONS 4' 1.

However, it subsequently declines in the oldest old 2 The UK's position in most rankings is stable, but the UK improved considerably in child life satisfaction rankings between 2007 and 2011 4 The relationship between self -reported health and subjective wellbeing is smaller in the UK than it is across Europe: people with poor health are not as likely to have poor wellbeing, compared with other European countries 5 Spain and Greece perform well on both children's objective and subjective wellbeing 1OECD Your Better Life Index (2013).

What is the UK story? Economic \"The recession in 2008 led to a sharp fall in GDP and impacted on income and debt levels at both the national and household level. Real income has fallen as inflation has grown faster than incomes, and the public sector debt ratio has increased\"1 Social \"In terms of our health, which is one of the most important influences on our wellbeing, our 'healthy' life expectancy has increased as has our overall satisfaction with health\"1 Environmental \"Nationally, the proportion of protected areas, including land and sea has increased. Globally, emissions and energy consumption have fallen and use of renewable energy has increased during the last decade\"1 Trends According to the latest findings from the ONS Annual Population Survey, there were small improvements in personal wellbeing i n the UK between 2011/12 and 2012/13. The percentage of people reporting higher levels of life satisfaction, feeling that the things they do i n life are worthwhile and happiness levels all increased while the percentage reporting higher levels of anxiety declined2 Between 2011/12 and 2012/13 there was a small but significant improvement in anxiety levels among those who rated their healt h as 'very good', 'good', or 'fair'. There were no significant changes for any wellbeing measures among those who rated their health negativel y2 \"Traditional measures of progress such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have long been recognised as an incomplete picture of the state of the nation. Other economic, social and environmental measures are needed alongside GDP to provide a complete picture of how society is doing\"1 Self-reported health had the strongest association with all the measures of subjective wellbeing. 'Life satisfaction' scores for those who said they were in bad health were lower on average than for people who reported good or very-good health3 The second strongest was employment status - people who are unemployed have significantly lower levels of 'life satisfaction', 'happy yesterday' than the employed3 The third was relationship status - people who are married or in a civil-partnership gave higher ratings for 'life satisfaction', 'feeling worthwhile' and 'happiness yesterday' than those in other relationship categories 3 Analysis from the Annual Population Survey shows that: 9 Adds years to life Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Increases life expectancy Life expectancy in the UK is currently 78.7 years for men and 82.6 years for women Life expectancy is a measure of objective wellbeing . Healthy life expectancy is one of the four indicators in the health domain of the ONS wellbeing framework Life expectancy at birth in England and Wales has increased consistently and steadily over time, from 71.0 years for males and 77.0 years for females in 1980-1982 to 78.7 years for males and 82.6 years for females in 2009-20111. 1ONS Interim Life Tables for England and Wales 2009- 2011 2Diener & Chan (2011).

The psychological wellbeing and health functioning of older people in England. Subjective wellbeing is predictive of mortality after controlling for initial health. This has been found across a number of health conditions including depression, anxiety, coronary heart disease and cancer. It is estimated that high levels of subjective wellbeing can increase life by 4 to 10 years compared to low levels of subjective wellbeing 2. Subjective wellbeing can add 4 -10 years to life Influences health and longevity in healthy populations Associated with survival in older populations Survival over an average of more than nine years was associated with greater enjoyment of life. Effects were large, with the risk of dying being around three times greater among individuals in the lowest (compared with the highest) third of enjoyment of life. These effects were independent of age, sex, ethnicity, wealth, education, baseline health and other factors 6. Similarly, a one unit increase in positive affect was associated with an 18% decrease in mortality risk in those aged 65 and over4.

Survival of more than 9 years was associated with enjoyment of life in older adults. May be more protective than negative wellbeing is detrimental Negative emotions predict mortality and positive emotions predict longevity. Wellbeing is associated with reduced mortality in both healthy and diseased populations. This may be mediated by social networks 3, or self reported health and physical activity4. Specifically, high levels of wellbeing are associated with a 19% reduction in all cause mortality and a 29% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in healthy populations, and a 23% reduction in mortality in patients with renal failure5. Wellbeing is associated with a 19% reduction in all cause mortality in healthy populations 10 Improves recovery from illness Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Subjective wellbeing can protect against developing illnesses. For example, a tendency to experience positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to developing the common cold. Additionally, people who had a tendency to experience negative emotions reported more unverified health complaints 1. Wellbeing can protect against developing illness Greater resistance to developing illness Subjective wellbeing can protect people when they have a physical illness. For example, those with a more negative emotional style tend to have a poorer immune system and may be at more risk of illness than those with a positive emotional style 5. Additionally, p atients with high baseline levels of wellbeing were 1.14 times more likely to recover and survive from an illness than those with low baseline levels of wellbeing 6. Although this effect is small, it can have large impact on the population as diseases are very prevalent in the population. Those with high wellbeing are more likely to recover and survive from illness An additional protective role in the course of physical illness 1Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper & Skoner (2003).

The impact of emotional wellbeing on long -term recovery and survival in p hysical illness: a meta analysis. Stress (a proxy for wellbeing) can lead to slower wound healing. For example, wound healing can take 24% longer in those who are exposed to stress3. Being married or in a relationship is good for people's wellbeing, however couples who experience marital conflict also experience slower wound healing 4. Low wellbeing is associated with slower wound healing Aids wound healing Positive emotions can undo the negative effects of negative emotions on health. Negative emotions generate increased cardiovascular activity, and positive emotions can undo harmful physiological effects by speeding physiological recovery to desirable levels 2. Can undo the negative effects of negative emotions High wellbeing can undo harmful physiological effects by speeding up recovery 11 Is associated with positive health behaviours in adults Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy People with high wellbeing are more likely to have a healthy diet, engage in physical activity and less likely to smoke Smoking is associated with people's levels of wellbeing. Men who do not smoke have been found to have higher levels of wellbeing than men who smoke. Women who have ever smoked in the past have been found to have lower levels of wellbeing than women who have never smoked 1. There is evidence of a causal link between smoking and wellbeing; quitting smoking tends to reduce anxiety2. Smoking is associated with lower levels of wellbeing, with evidence of a causal link. Smoking Physical activity can reduce anxiety and depression and reduces reactivity to psychosocial stressors3. Adults who met the guidelines for physical activity reported the highest levels of wellbeing 4. Physical Activity People of normal weight have been found to have highest wellbeing scores compared with those who were overweight or obese. Similarly, those who perceived themselves to be the right weight had highest wellbeing scores 4. There is a dose relationship between the number of portions of fruit and vegetables consumed per day and levels of wellbeing in adults: an increase in the number of portions consumed corresponded with an increase in wellbeing 1. Obesity and Diet Being a normal weight and perceiving yourself to be the right weight are both associated with higher levels of wellbeing. Moderate levels of alcohol consumption has been associated with higher levels of wellbeing. People's drinking habits are affected by the habits of their friends and family, for example drinking similar amounts to their social contacts 5. Alcohol can be causal factor for depression6, however moderate levels of consumption have been better cognition, higher levels of wellbeing and fewer depressive symptoms 7. Additionally, moderate consumption interacts with sociability and can be associated with higher levels of wellbeing. 45% of the drug dependant population were found to have a psychiatric disorder compared to 12% of the non -drug dependant population 6.

Children and young people's diet appears to have no association with wellbeing after controlling or other factors4. Young people's self -reported physical activity level was not associated with wellbeing after controlling for other factors 4, although this may be due to the errors inherent in self -report measures: studies using objective measures of activity (accelerometers) have found positive associations5. Drinking alcohol among 11 -17 year olds does not appear to be associated with wellbeing, after taking into account other factors2,4. High wellbeing is associated with fewer health risk behaviours among 15 to 17 year olds Source: Lifecourse Tracker, Baseline 2012. 15 -17 year olds. Higher levels of wellbeing was associated with a lower likelihood of having engaged in health risk behaviours, such as smoking, intercourse or drug use, among 15 to 17 year olds1. Girls between 11 and 15 who engage in multiple risk behaviours are more likely to have low levels of wellbeing. 11 (but not 13 and 15) year old boys also show this association. 2 Sports club participation is associated with higher emotional wellbeing for five year olds3, and lower ratings of child unhappiness from parents of 7 year olds 4. In a study of children aged 10 -11 years, objectively measured physical activity (from accelerometers) was associated with higher levels of wellbeing 5.

This effect is strongest for friendships which are mutually reciprocated.1 Even people we are not emotionally close to can affect our happiness: people whose next door neighbours become happy are more likely to become happy themselves. 15.3% 9.8% 5.6% 0%5%10%15%20% 1 degree 2 degrees 3 degrees Social distance from a happy individual Increases the wellbeing of our partners The wellbeing of an individual's partner has implications for their own wellbeing. Having a partner with higher levels of wellbeing is associated with higher levels of personal wellbeing, but having a partner with low levels of wellbeing is worse than having no partner at all.3 Influences the wellbeing of our children Parents' mental health and wellbeing are strongly associated with their children's. Mothers' risk of mental illness predicts the onset and persistence of emotional disorders in children aged 5-16 4, and maternal mental health difficulties are associated with low levels of wellbeing among children at even younger ages (age 3 -5). 5 Mothers' wellbeing is also associated with children's wellbeing scores between the ages of 11 and 15: increases in mothers' scores were associated with increases in children's.3 A nearby friend who becomes happy increases your probability of becoming happy by 63% Parents' and children's wellbeing and mental health are strongly linked, even after children have left home Researchers theorise that the spread of happiness in social networks may be due to 'emotional contagion', where people 'catch' emotional states from those near to them (both emotionally close and physically close). However, cognitive measures of wellbeing, such as life satisfaction, are linked within families and across distances: parents' life satisfaction is predicted by that of their adult children, even if they live a considerable distance apart. 2 Source: Framingham Heart Study.

Conversely, social isolation reduces wellbeing Relationships Unemployment is strongly associated with a reduction in life satisfaction The average life satisfaction rating of unemployed people is 6.6 out of 10 compared to 7.6 for employed people (see graph below)1.

Social isolation reduces wellbeing. People with no friends have 13% lower probability of being very satisfied compared to those who have at least one friend 4. Commuting Commuting has been linked with a variety of negative effects to well-being and has negative effects on overall life satisfaction 6. If the method of commuting is more active however (walking or cycling etc.) this could also affect well-being via positive health effects (physical and mental)7. Education Those who have spent less time in education have been found to have higher levels of depression and anxiety 8. Higher levels of qualifications and continued formal and informal learning have been found to be associated with greater individual subjective well- being 9. Education has been found to be a virtually universal correlate of wellbeing Crime There is a strong negative relationship between rates of violent crime in an area and the wellbeing of residents 5. Individuals living in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods lacked access to parks they considered safe and as a result were less likely to participate in physical activities than those in more affluent neighbourhoods 11. 1ONS (2013).

NHS organisations which have more favourable indicators of staff wellbeing have better attendance, lower staff turnover, less agency spend, higher patient satisfaction and better outcome measures 7. Wellbeing affects patient services Where patients rate their care as 'bad', staff also feel their wellbeing is low, with high job demand and burnout risks. Where patients rate their care as 'good', staff feel much more supported, in a good team and with high job satisfaction6. Boorman concluded \"...protecting and improving staff health is not a fluffy, cuddly thing to do, but rather a key enabler to support improvements in high quality care, patient satisfaction and improved efficieny\" 4. Public Health Responsibility Deal The Public Health Responsibility Deal's Health at Work Network is committed to actively supporting the workforce to lead healthier lives. There is a specific pledge on mental health and wellbeing, which includes providing all staff with the environment, knowledge and tools to develop and maintain emotional resilience and mental wellbeing 5. 1Black (2008).

Social happiness - Theory into policy and practice Patients' experience of care is an important factor or their health and wellbeing People are concerned with their health but they also care about their experience of illness and the services they receive. How patients experience care can be an important factor alongside the actual medical treatment they receive. Consideration of patient choices and their care environment (e.g., flowers, pictures in hospitals or care homes) can have a positive impact on how quickly someone recovers and can impact on their longevity 4 . Compassion is important in healthcare A number of government reviews have reaffirmed the importance of compassion in healthcare: Winterbourne View Review (2001) Francis Inquiry (2005-9) Keogh Review (2013) There is a (causal) link between staff who have autonomy in their jobs and who work in a supportive environment, and patient satisfaction with the care they receive and patient outcomes 3. \"We all have an innate capacity to be compassionate.....it is something that can be cultivated\"2 17 Affects decisions about the range of local services The Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) 1, the NHS Outcomes Framework ( NHSOF)2 and the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework ( ASCOF) 3 all include wellbeing indicators Many factors influence public health over the course of a lifetime. Public health has been integrated into local government and services will be planned and delivered in the context of the broader social determinants of health. The NHS, social care, the voluntary sector and communities will all work together to make this happen. 1 Public Health England (PHE) is the new national delivery organisation of the public health system. It works with partners across the public health system and in wider society to: > deliver support and enable improvements in health and wellbeing in the areas set out in this outcomes framework > design and maintain systems to protect the population against existing and future threats to health. 1 Health and wellbeing boards have strategic influence over commissioning decisions across health, public health and social care. Boards bring together clinical commissioning groups and councils to develop a shared understanding of the health and wellbeing needs of the community. They undertake a Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and develop a joint strategy for how these needs can be best addressed - including recommendations for joint services across health and care. Other services that impact on health and wellbeing such as housing and education provision will also be addressed. 4 Local authorities have set up statutory health and wellbeing boards to drive local commissioning and integration of all health services, based upon local needs, giving new opportunities to improve the health and wellbeing of local communities right across the life course. Local authorities commission public health services on their populations' behalf, resourced by a ring-fenced grant, and put health and wellbeing at the heart of all their activity. 1 Some local areas already have established wellbeing programmes and services The Big Lottery Fund is funding and evaluating local wellbeing projects.5 Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy 1Department of Health (2012).

National Wellbeing Evaluation 18 Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy A quality adjusted life year (QALY) is a measure of health which includes the quality of life and the quantity of life lived . Quality of life is measured on a scale where zero is dead and 1 is perfect health. Under some methods for calculating quality of life, quality of life can be negative, i.e. worse than being dead. For example, if a policy intervention improves quality of life from 0.25 to 0.75 (i.e., by 0.5) and this effect lasts 5 years, then this policy has a benefit of 2.5 QALYs . (0.5 x 5 years) The QALY has been criticised for not taking better account of wellbeing. Currently QALYs are underpinned by description of health (e.g. mobility, self care, pain, usual activities and depression/anxiety). How might policies change if wellbeing was used as the outcome rather than just health? Weighting of health related quality of life measures would be better if they were based on people's experiences rather than their hypothetical preferences . The Department has commissioned University of Sheffield to carry out research looking at how subjective wellbeing can be measured, valued and combined with EQ-5D. It will: 1) provide a wellbeing index - anchored and unanchored on the zero being equivalent to dead 2) use the wellbeing index to weight the EQ - 5D measure of health related quality of life which currently underpins QALYs. The project is also examining basing measures of quality of life based on experience rather than hypothetical preferences. This project has an informal working group and should provide an interim report early next year. This project is a step towards developing a broader measure of quality of life that can be used in economic evaluation. This means when QALYs are calculated , e.g., in cost benefit analysis for an impact assessment, the costs and benefits of a policy would take into account wellbeing, and therefore would become more integrated in the policy making process. Has implications for treatment decisions and costs While people with good health tend to have high wellbeing this is not always the case - 38% of people with poor health have high wellbeing and 18% of people with good health have low wellbeing.1 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0 Very good or goodFair Bad or very badPercentage Self-reported health status Wellbeing by self -reported health Low satisfaction with life (0 -6) Medium/high satisfaction with life (7 -10) 1ONS (2012). Measuring National Wellbeing: Health 19 May ultimately reduce the healthcare burden Wellbeing is important to health and health is important to wellbeing. Healthier lifestyles and good health status are both associated with higher levels of wellbeing. Therefore focusing policies on wellbeing could lead to improved wellbeing and also improved health outcomes. This could: Reduce the healthcare burden associated with an ageing population Improve the UK's position internationally on health outcomes Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Delivery route to reduce the healthcare burden DH embeds wellbeing into policy making PHE supports local authorities to deliver the policies Local authorities deliver the policies in their area PHE offer support to local authorities to deliver policies to improve wellbeing Local authorities request more support for improving wellbeing in their area PHE Centres NHS -E Regions Local Authorities NHS -E Area Teams CCGs Local area wellbeing measurement stimulates interest among local authorities Local authorities can measure improvements to wellbeing locally 20 Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Policy interventions which can improve wellbeing include health, learning, work, environment, social inclusion, activity and relationships, and parenting and early years interventions Wellbeing demonstrates two way causality with a number of other variables across domains such as health, work and social relationships.1 The Big Lottery Fund National Well -being Evaluation found a number of factors were key in projects aimed at improving wellbeing5: Identifying local need Taking a holistic approach Engaging the target group, understanding the barriers to participants involvement. Using safe, welcoming and easy to access venues Project staff who are empathetic and enthusiastic The use of volunteers in projects Imparting skills and knowledge to participants Social interventions Effective interventions to improve relationships and reduce social isolation include: Timebanking Social prescriptions4 For older people effective policies include: Befriending Community navigators Self help groups2 Parenting and early years interventions2 Pre-school interventions have been found to be the most cost effective, followed by school age interventions. Effective policies include: Skin to skin contact; kangaroo care Parental programmes Intensive family support and family recovery programmes Work interventions2 Improving employment chances Support for those recovering from mental health problems. Reducing mental health problems in the workplace. Promoting employee mental health in the workplace Reducing stigma and discrimination Reducing stigma in relation to mental health Learning interventions3 Early education programmes are associated with: increased cognitive skills school preparedness better academic achievement positive effect on family outcomes Health interventions Increasing physical activity has been found to improve the wellbeing of older people. This can be delivered through community based exercise programmes. 2 Employee mental health in the workplace has been promoted through 2: Early diagnosis and treatment at work Psychological interventions linked to causal factors Sustained contact between employers and staff when staff are absent, as well as contact between health care providers and employers 1De Neve, Diener, Tay and Xuereb (2013)The objective benefits of subjective wellbeing 2 Public Health England.

Subjective wellbeing as an affective\u2014cognitive construct. About 40% of wellbeing is explained by genetics and the remainder is explained by environmental factors (e.g., work, relationships, housing, health, income). However , while our DNA sequence does not change, the effect our DNA has on our lives can change. This challenges the concept of a 'wellbeing set- point; and means that wellbeing levels are modifiable .2 Homeostasis Theory - in normal populations wellbeing is actively controlled and maintained within a narrow 'set point' range of values . 70 to 80 percentage points is the optimum set -point range . This means that people revert back to their original level of wellbeing after positive and negative circumstances. Therefore, if someone reports similar levels of wellbeing as previously, this does not mean that their situation has not changed for the better.3 Wellbeing should be an outcome alongside other, more objective, outcomes. Evaluation should be conducted quickly after an intervention to avoid the effects of adaptation. If wellbeing is used in interventions and a significant change in reported levels of wellbeing is not reported, this does not necessarily mean the policy or intervention has failed or that it did not really change people's circumstances. Wellbeing needs a genuine, long lifecourse perspective: just because something does not have an immediate association with wellbeing, it does not mean that it does not have a longer term association. 22 What can you do? Wellbeing: Why it matters to health policy Research, Data and Analysis Add subjective well being questions to surveys and policy evaluations. Analyse and interpret available research and data. Communications Develop and disseminate a wellbeing narrative to specific policy areas e.g. carers, care and compassion Provide data to the public to inform their choices e.g. smoking and wellbeing Policy Run short well -being workshops to see how to stretch policy. Build on what drives our wellbeing to other policies. Offer an area for an open policy making 'innovation project' Examples Health survey for England Local Wellbeing survey of 15 year olds Reassessing how QALYs weight wellbeing Examples Publish 'Predicting Wellbeing' report PHE's 'Smart Restart' Campaign Examples Policy workshop on 'Keogh' review of cosmetic surgery recommendations, the Vulnerable Older People Plan, and alcohol strategy Supported 'loneliness' as an innovation project Managers can take account of wellbeing in their strategic and day -to-day decision making by... 23 A Compendium of Factsheets 1.
