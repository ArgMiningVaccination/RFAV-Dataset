NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Atripla 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efav irenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). Excipient(s): Each film-coated tablet contains 1 mmol (23.6 mg) of sodium. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet. Pink, capsule shaped, film-coated tablet, debossed with \"123\" on one side, plain on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Atripla is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, em tricitabine and tenofovir diso proxil fumarate. It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficien cy virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Atripla prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). The demonstration of the benefit of Atripla is primar ily based on 48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a combination antiretroviral therapy changed to Atripla (see section 5.1). No data are currently available from clinical studies with Atripla in treatment-na\u00efve or in heavily pretreated patients. No data are available to support the combinati on of Atripla and other antiretroviral agents. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Posology Adults: the recommended dose of Atripla is one tablet taken orally once daily. Method of administration It is recommended that Atripla be swallowed whole with water. It is recommended that Atripla be taken on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 3 In order to improve the tolerability to efavirenz with respect to undesirable effects on the nervous system, bedtime dosing is recommended (see section 4.8). It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure will be approximately 35% lower following administration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenof ovir disoproxil fumarate when taken with food (see section 5.2). In virologi cally suppressed patients, the clinical relevance of this reduction can be expected to be limited (see sec tion 5.1). Further data on the clinical translation of the decrease in pharmacokinetic exposure is awaited. Children and adolescents: Atripla is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy. Elderly: insufficient numbers of elderly patients have been evaluated in clinical studies of the components of Atripla to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Caution should be exercised when prescribing Atripla to the elderly, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function in these patients. Dose adjustment: if Atripla is co-administered with rifa mpicin, an additional 200 mg/day (800 mg total) of efavirenz is recommended (see section 4.5). Renal insufficiency: Atripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 50 ml/min). Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenof ovir disoproxil fumarate that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Hepatic impairment: the pharmacokinetics of Atripla have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT), Grade A or B) may be treated with the normal recommended dose of Atripla (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Patients should be monitored carefully for adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms related to efavirenz (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). If Atripla is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). It is important to take Atripla on a regular dosi ng schedule to avoid missing doses. Patients should be told that if they forget to take Atripla, they should take the missed dose right away, unless it is less than 12 hours until the next day's dose. In this case, patients should be told not to take the missed dose and to take their next dose at the usual time. Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Atripla is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate preparations of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are available. Please refer to the Su mmary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. If therapy with Atripla is discontinued, consideration should be given to the long half-life of efavirenz (see section 5.2) and long intracellular half-liv es of tenofovir and emtricitabine. Because of interpatient variability in these parameters and c oncerns regarding development of resistance, HIV treatment guidelines should be consulted, also taking into consideration the reason for discontinuation. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substan ces or to any of the excipients. Atripla must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT Grade C) (see section 5.2). Atripla must not be administered concurrently w result in inhibition of metabo lism and create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening undesirable effects (for exampl e, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression) (see section 4.5). Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) must not be used while taking Atripla due to the risk of decreased plasma concen trations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plas ma concentrations while voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrati ons. Since Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Atripla must not be co-administered (see section 4.5). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use General: as a fixed combination, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing any of the same ac tive components, efavirenz, emtricitabine or ities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5). Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil. Currently available data indicate a trend that in patients on a PI-based antiretroviral regimen the switch to Atripla may lead to a reduction of the respon se to the therapy (see section 5.1). These patients should be carefully monitored for rises in viral load and, since the safety profile of efavirenz differs from that of protease inhibitors, for adverse reactions. Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with he patic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/or d eep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness). Lactic acidosis has a high morta lity and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure or renal failure. Lactic aci dosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment. Treatment with nucleoside analogues must be discontinued in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, pr ogressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating levels. Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or othe r known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol). Co-infection with hepatitis C and treatment with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk. Patients at increased risk must be followed closely. Opportunistic infections: patients receiving Atripla or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other compli cations of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. Transmission of HIV: patients must be advised that antiretroviral therapies, including Atripla, have not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood. Appropriate precautions must continue to be used. Liver disease: the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders (s ee section 5.2). Atripla is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Since efavirenz is principally metabolised 5 by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system, caution should be exercised in administering Atripla to patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease. These patients should be carefully monitored for efavirenz adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms. Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see section 4.2). Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction includ ing chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during comb ination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with Atripla needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8). In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver enzymes is also recommended. Patients with HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) co-infection: patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiret roviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepa tic adverse reactions. Physicians should refer to current HIV treatme nt guidelines for the optimal management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with HBV. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. The safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been stud ied for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Emtricitabine and tenofovir indi vidually and in combination have shown activity against HBV in pharmacodynamic studies (see section 5.1). Limited clinical experience suggests that emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have an anti-HBV activity when used in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection. Discontinuation of Atripla therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacer bations of hepatitis. Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Atripla must be clos ely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least four months after stopping treat ment with Atripla. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In pa tients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended sin ce post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. Psychiatric symptoms: psychiatric adverse reactions have b een reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a prior history of psychiat ric disorders appear to be at greater risk of these serious psychiatric adverse reactions. In particul ar, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. There have also been pos t-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions and psychosis-like behaviour. Pa tients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suic idal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility th at the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risk of continued therapy outweighs the benefits (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms: symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming are fre quently reported undesirable effects in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily in clinical studies. Dizziness was also seen in clinical studies with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Headache has been reported in clinical studies with emtricitabine (see section 4.8). Nervous system symptoms associated with efavirenz usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and gene rally resolve after the first two to four weeks. Patients should be informed that if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not predictive of subseque nt onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. 6 Seizures: convulsions have been observed in patients r eceiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of a known medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a drug interaction study, carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbama zepine was co-administered with efavirenz (see section 4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Renal impairment: Atripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate that cannot be achieve d with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Use of Atripla should be avoided with c oncurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. If concomitant use of Atripla and nephrotox ic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir, interleukin-2) is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated crea tinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in clinical practice (see section 4.8). It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculate d in all patients prior to initiating therapy with Atripla and renal function (creatinine clearan ce and serum phosphate) is also monitored every four weeks during the first year and then every three months. In patients with a history of renal dysfunction or in patients who are at risk for renal dysfunction, consideration must be given to more frequent monitoring of renal function. If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or cr eatinine clearance is decre ased to < 50 ml/min in any patient receiving Atripla, renal function must be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium a nd urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Since Atripla is a combination product and the dosing interval of the individual components cannot be altered, treatment wi th Atripla must be interrupted in patients with confirmed creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl (0.32 mmol/l). Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Atripla is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate prepar ations of efavirenz, Skin reactions: mild-to-moderate rash has been reported w ith the individual components of Atripla. The rash associated with the efavirenz component usually resolves with continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration has been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz (see section 4.8). The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approxima tely 0.1%. Atripla must be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with b listering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever. Patients who discontinued treatment with ot her non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors due to rash may be at higher risk of developing rash during treatment with Atripla. Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy ) in HIV patients. The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. Knowledge a bout the mechanism is incomplete. A connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhib has been hypoth esised. A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug-related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat re distribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood gl ucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8). 7 Effect of food: the administration of Atripla with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may lead to an increase in freque ncy of adverse reactions (see section 4.8). It is recommended that Atripla be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial dama ge. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues. The main adverse disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia). These events are often transitory. Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypert onia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanen t is currently unknown. Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV negati ve children, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for po ssible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms. These findings do not aff ect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. Immune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral th erapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and pneumonia Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be mu ltifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, high er body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. Bone: in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with in combination with lamivudine and ef avirenz in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, small decreases in bone mineral density of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in bone mineral density of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in bone mineral density of the hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evid ence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8). If bone abnormaliti es are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Other antiretroviral agents: no data are available on the safety and efficacy of Atripla in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Didanosine : co-administration of Atripla and didano sine is not recommended since exposure to didanosine is increased following co-a dministration with tenof ovir with HIV-1 harbouring mutations: Atripla should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R, M184V/I or K103N mutation (see sections 4.1 and 5.1). Excipients: this medicinal product contains 1 mmol ( 23.6 mg) of sodium per dose which should be taken into consideration by patie nts on a controlled sodium diet. 8 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal pr oducts and other forms of interaction No drug interaction studies have been conducted usi ng Atripla. As Atripla contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoprox il fumarate, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with Atripla. In teraction studies with these agents have only been performed in adults. As a fixed combination, Atripla should not be ad ministered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing any of the components, efav irenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil as fumarate. Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine. Atripla should not be administered with adefovir dipivoxil. is an inducer of some CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Other compounds that are subs trates of CYP3A4 may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administere d with efavirenz. Efavirenz e xposure may also be altered when given with medicinal products or food (for example, grapefruit juice) which affect CYP3A4 activity. In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction st udies have shown the potential for CYP450- mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and te nofovir disoproxil fumarate with other medicinal products is low. Contraindications of concomitant use Atripla must not be administered methylergonovine), since inhibitio n of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3). Voriconazole: co-administration of standard doses of efav irenz and voriconazole is contraindicated. Since Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, th e dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Atripla must not be co-a dministered (see section 4.3 and Table 1). St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum): co-administration of Atripla and St. John's wort or herbal preparations containing St. John's wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use not recommended Atazanavir/ritonavir: insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with Atripla. Therefore co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and Atripla is not recommended (see Table 1). Didanosine: co-administration of Atripla and didanos ine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 1). Renally eliminated medicinal products: since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of Atripla with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co -administered medicinal products. Use of Atripla should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, ci dofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). Other interactions Interactions between the components of Atripla and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral me dicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \" \", decrease as \" \", no change as \" \", twice daily as \"b.i.d.\", once daily as \"q.d.\" and once every 8 hours as \"q8h\"). If ava ilable, 90% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses. 9 Table 1: Interactions between the individual components of Atripla and other medicinal products Medicinal product by therapeutic areas (dose in mg) Effects on drug levels Mean percent change in AUC, C max, C min with 90% confidence intervals if available (mechanism) Recommendation concerning co-administration with Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg, effect of efavirenz is compensated by the pharmacokinetic booster effect of ritonavir) For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir in combination a protease inhibitor, see section ritonavir below. Amprenavir/Emtricitabine Interaction not Amprenavir/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. 10) Co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir with tenofovir resulted in increased exposure to tenofovir. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir- associated adverse events, renal ritonavir resulted in atazanavir exposure due to CYP3A4 induction, necessitating dosage adjustment of atazanavir (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the medicinal product containing atazanavir). Co-administration of efavirenz and atazanavir in combination with ritonavir may lead to increases in efavirenz exposure which may worsen the tolerability profile of efavirenz. Atazanavir/Ritonavir/Emtricitab ine Interaction not studied. Co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and is not to 46) Evening AUC: 46%* ( 37 to 54) Morning C max: * Afternoon C max: * Evening C max: 29%* ( 11 to 43) Morning C min: 24 to 51) Afternoon C min: 47 to 57) Evening C min: 57%* ( 50 to 63) * when compared to 800 q8h alone (CYP3A4 induction) For co-administration a to make a dosing recommendation for indinavir when dosed with Atripla. While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen containing both efavirenz, a component of to 66) Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for lopinavir/ritonavir when dosed with Atripla. Co-administration 11 Lopinavir/Ritonavir/Efavirenz Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure, necessitating dosage adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir. When used in combination with efavirenz and two NRTIs, 533/133 mg lopinavir/ritonavir (soft capsules) twice daily yielded similar lopinavir plasma concentrations as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (soft capsules) 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz (historical data). Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for lopinavir/ritonavir tablets for pharmacokinetic data when this formulation was administered with efavirenz. For co-administration of efavirenz with low- dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir below. Lopinavir/Ritonavir/Emtricitabine Morning C max: 24% ( 12 to 38) Evening C max: Morning C min: 42% ( 9 to 86) to 50) (inhibition of CYP-mediated oxidative metabolism) When efavirenz was given with ritonavir 500 mg or 600 mg twice daily, the combination was not well tolerated (for example, dizziness, nausea, paraesthesia and elevated liver en zymes occurred). Sufficient data on the tolerability of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg, once or twice daily) are not available. Ritonavir/Emtricitabine (600 b.i.d./600 q.d.) Interaction not studied. Interaction not studied. Co-administration of ritonavir at doses of 600 mg and Atripla is not recommended. When using Atripla in a regimen including low-dose ritonavir, the possibility of an increase in the incidence of efavirenz-associated adverse events should be considered, due to possible pharmacodynamic interaction. Saquinavir/Efavirenz (1,200 soft capsule formulation q8h/600 45 28 to 66) Cmin: 56% to 20) Cmin: 14% ( 2 to 24) Use of Atripla in combination with saquinavir as the sole protease inhibitor in no pharmacokinetic interaction. Saquinavir/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Saquinavir/Ritonavir/Efavirenz No da ta are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with the combination of saquinavir and ritonavir. For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir above. Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for saquinavir/ritonavir when dosed with Atripla. Co-administration not recommended. NRTIs and NNRTIs NRTIs/Efavirenz Specific interaction studies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine (see section 4.4), zidovudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Clinically significant interactions would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways. NNRTIs/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. The potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions is unknown. Since use of two NNRTIs proved not beneficial in terms of efficacy and safety, co-administration of Atripla and another NNRTI a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphoryl ated (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virologic failure within several tested combinations. Didanosine/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. Didanosine/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Co-administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended (see section Clarithromycin/Efavirenz (500 b.i.d./400 q.d.) to 19) (CYP3A4 Rash developed 46% of uninfected volunteers receiving and clarithromycin. Clarithromycin/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Clarithromycin/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. The clinical significance of these changes in clarithromycin plasma levels is not known. Alternatives to clarithromycin (e.g. azithromycin) may be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in studied. Rifabutin/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. The daily dose of rifabutin should be increased by 50% when given with Atripla. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week in combination with Atripla. Rifampicin/Efavirenz (600 q.d./600 additional 200 mg/day (800 mg total) of efavirenz is recommended when rifampicin is co-administered with Atripla. No dose adjustment of rifampicin is recommended to 51) Cmin: not studied. Itraconazole/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. No dose recommendations can be made for the use of Atripla in combination with itraconazole. An alternative antifungal treatment should considered. standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Voriconazole/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Voriconazole/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. Since Atripla is a fixed- dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and efavirenz or carbam azepine has not been studied. Carbamazepine/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Carbamazepine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. No dose recommendation can be made for the use of Atripla with carbamazepine. An alternative anticonvulsant should be considered. Carbamazepine plasma levels should be monitored periodically. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and other anticonvulsants that are substrates of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There is a potential for reduction or increase in the plasma concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital and other anticonvulsants that are substrates of CYP450 isoenzymes with efavirenz. When Atripla is co- administered with an anticonvulsant that is a substrate of CYP450 isoenzymes, periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant levels should be conducted. Vigabatrin/Efavirenz Gabapentin/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. Clinically significant interactions are not expected since vigabatrin and gabapentin are exclusively eliminated unchanged in the urine and are unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways as gabapentin can be co-administered without studied. When co-administered with Atripla, sertraline dose increases should be guided by studied. Atripla and paroxetine can be co-administered without dose adjustment. Fluoxetine/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. Since fluoxetine shares a similar metabolic profile with paroxetine, i.e. a strong CYP2D6 inhibitory effect, a similar lack of interaction would be expected for fluoxetine. Fluoxetine/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Fluoxetine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. Atripla and fluoxetine can be co-administered without dose adjustment. CARDIOVASCULAR q.d./600 13% (CYP3A4 induction) The increase in efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters is not considered clinically significant. Diltiazem/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Diltiazem/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. Dose adjustments of diltiazem when co- administered with Atripla should be guided by clinical response (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for diltiazem). 16 Verapamil, Felodipine, Nifedipine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. When efavirenz is co- administered with a calcium channel blocker that is a substrate of the CYP3A4 enzyme, there is a potential for reduction in the plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with Atripla should be guided by clinical response (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the calcium channel blocker). LIPID LOWERING MEDICINAL PRODUCTS HMG 31) 26) Atorvastatin/Emtricitabine Interaction not 12) Pravastatin/Emtricitabine Interaction not affect efavirenz AUC or max values. Simvastatin/Emtricitabine Interaction not studied. Simvastatin/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Interaction not studied. Cholesterol levels should be periodically monitored when atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin is co-administered with Atripla. Dosage adjustments of statins may be required (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the statin). HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES AUC: Cmax: (mechanism unknown) The clinical significance of the effect on ethinyloestradiol AU C is not known. Because the potential interaction of efavirenz, a component of Atripla, with oral contraceptives has not been fully characterised, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to oral (see section 4.6). IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS Tacrolimus/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. exposure of tacrolimus may be expected (CYP3A4 induction). Tacrolimus is not anticipated may be required. Close monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations for at least two weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment 25 to 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. The methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to receiving methadone and Atripla concomitantly should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. HERBAL PRODUCTS St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )/Efavirenz Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John's wort due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John's wort. St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum Atripla and St. John's wort is contraindicated. If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, stop St. John's wort, check viral levels and if possible 18 St. John's wort ( Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John's wort. The inducing effect of St. John's wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment. Studies conducted with other medicinal products: there were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when efavirenz and other imidazole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, has not been studied. There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when emtricitabine was administered with stavudine, zidovudine or famciclovir. Ther e no Pregnancy and lactation Atripla should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (there are no other appropriate treatment options). Women of child bearing potential: pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving Atripla. Barrier contraception should always be used in combin ation with other methods of contraception (for example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives) whil e on therapy with Atripla. Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contr aceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of Atripla is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pr egnancy testing before initiation of Atripla. Pregnancy: there are no adequate or well-controlled studi es of Atripla or its components in pregnant women. In post-marketing experience through an antiretroviral pregnancy registry, more than 200 pregnancies with first-trimester exposure to ef avirenz as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen have been reported with no specific malforma tion pattern. Retrospectively in this registry, a small number of cases of neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele, have been reported but causality has not been established. Studies of efav irenz in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including marked teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). Lactation: studies in rats have demonstrated that ef avirenz and tenofovir are excreted in milk; concentrations of efavirenz were much higher than t hose in maternal plasma. It is not known whether efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for both HIV transmission and the potential for serious und esirable effects in breast-feeding infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving Atripla. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, dizziness has been reported during treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil concen tration and/or somnolence. Patients should be instructed that if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving and operating machinery. 19 4.8 Undesirable effects Assessment of adverse reactions for the fixed combination Atripla is based on experience from: a 48-week clinical study of Atripla (see Table 2) a clinical study in which efavirenz, emtricitabi ne and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were co- administered (see Table 3) clinical study and post-marketing experience w ith the individual components of Atripla (see Table 4). In Tables 2, 3 and 4 undesirable effects are presen ted in order of decreasing seriousness within each frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined as very common ( 1/10), common ( 1/100, < 1/10) or uncommon ( 1/1,000, < 1/100). Adverse reactions from clinical study experience with Atripla In a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients with successful virological suppression on their current antiretroviral regimen, patients either changed to Atripla (n=203) or continued on their original antiretroviral treatme nt regimen (n=97). Treatment-emergent adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs reported in patients who received Atripla in study AI266073 are listed by body system organ class and frequency in Table 2. Table 2: All treatment-emergent adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to Atripla reported in study AI266073 (over 48 weeks) Atripla (n=203) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common anorexia Uncommon fat redistribution, hypertriglyceridaemia, weight decreased, increased appetite Psychiatric disorders: Common nightmare, depression, depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, mood altered, abnormal dreams, sleep disorder Uncommon confusional state, disorientation, personality change, mood swings, libido decreased Nervous system disorders: Very common dizziness Common somnolence, headache Uncommon incoherent speech Eye disorders: Uncommon vision blurred, altered visual depth perception Ear and labyrinth disorders: Uncommon vertigo Vascular disorders: Common hot flush pancreatitis acute, hypoaesthesia oral, flatulence, dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon hepatitis acute Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Common rash, night sweats Uncommon and urinary disorders: Common blood creatinine increased Reproductive system and breast disorders: Uncommon breast enlargement General disorders and administration site conditions: Common fatigue, energy increased Uncommon feeling abnormal, feeling jittery, chills Adverse reactions from clinical study experience with efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate The following data are derived from a clinical st udy (GS-01-934) in which efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were co-administered without regard to food as individual formulations or as a dual fixed combination of em tricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with efavirenz. Selected treatment-emergent adve rse reactions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs from this study reported in patients after 144 weeks of treatment are listed by body system organ class and frequency in Table 3. Table 3: Selected treatment-emergent adverse react ions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs (efavirenz, emtricitabine and te nofovir disoproxil fumarate) (n=257) system disorders: system disorders: Very common dizziness Common somnolence, stupor, lethargy, headache, disturbance of attention Uncommon amnesia, ataxia, ba lance disorder, dysgeusia Eye disorders: Uncommon vision blurred Ear and labyrinth disorders: thoracic and mediastinal Common diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, dry mouth Uncommon dyspepsia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Very common rash Common pruritus, skin hyperpigmentation, dermatitis Uncommon urticaria, dry skin, eczema Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common decreased appetite, increased appetite Uncommon hypertriglyceridaemia, anorexia Vascular disorders: Common hot flush 21 Efavirenz+emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=257) General disorders and administration site conditions: Common fatigue, fever Uncommon asthenia, feeling drunk Psychiatric disorders: Very common abnormal dreams Common nightmares, depression, insomnia, sleep disorder, euphoric mood Uncommon paranoia, psychomotor agitation, delusion, confusional state, anxiety, aggression, nervousness, disorientation Laboratory test abnormalities: Liver enzymes: in a 144- week clinical study (GS-01-934), elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST > 5 times ULN (upper limit of normal)) and of alanine aminotransferase (ALT > 5 times ULN) were reporte d in 3% and 2% efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine (n=254), respectively. Adverse reactions associated with the individual components of Atripla The adverse reactions from clinical study and po st-marketing experience with the individual components of Atripla in antiretroviral combina tion therapy are listed in Table 4 below by body system organ class and frequency. The most notable adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical studies with efavirenz are rash and nervous system symptoms. The administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequenc y of adverse reactions (see section 4.4). There have been post-marketing reports in association with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate of renal and urinary disorders including renal failure, proxima l tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome), acute tubular necrosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Table 4: Adverse reactions associated with th e individual components of Atripla based on clinical study and post-marketing safety experience Uncommon anaemia Nervous system disorders: Very common headache dizziness Common somnolence, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness dizziness Uncommon convulsions, amnesia, thinking abnormal, ataxia, coordination abnormal, agitation Not known* cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances Eye disorders: Uncommon vision blurred Ear and labyrinth disorders: diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea Common diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea elevated amylase including elevated pancreatic amylase, elevated serum lipase, vomiting, dyspepsia known* pancreatitis Renal and urinary disorders: Not known* renal failure (acute and chronic), acute tubular necrosis, proximal renal tubulopathy including Fanconi disorders: Very common rash (all grades, 18%) Common pruritus allergic reaction, vesiculobullous rash, pustular kinase known* rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Very fatigue pain, asthenia Not known* asthenia failure hepatitis, increased transaminases, hepatic steatosis Reproductive system and breast disorders: Uncommon gynaecomastia Psychiatric disorders: Common depression (severe in 1.6%), anxiety, abnormal dreams, insomnia abnormal dreams, insomnia Uncommon suicide attempt, suicide ideation, mania, paranoia, hallucination, euphoric mood, affect lability, confusional state, aggression Not known* completed suicide, psychosis, delusion, neurosis * These adverse reactions have been identified through post-marketing safety surveillance and the frequency is not known. The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdom yolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain infrequently to fractures), hy pokalaemia, muscular weakness, myopathy and hypophosphataemia. These events are ered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy in the absence of proximal with efavirenz: rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolves with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month. In clinical studies, 1.7% of patients treated with efavirenz discontinued therapy becau se of rash. Efavirenz can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Use of appropriate antih istamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when efavirenz is restarted. Experience with efavirenz in patients who disc ontinued other antiretroviral agents of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNR TI) class is limited. Nineteen patients who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these patients 24 developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two discontinued because of rash. Psychiatric symptoms with efavirenz: patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of serious psychiatric adverse reactions listed in the efavirenz colu mn of Table 4 with the frequency of events ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe depression and suicidal ideation. Nervous system symptoms with efavirenz: in clinical controlled studies, nervous system symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19.4% of patients compared to 9.0% of patients receiving control regimens. These symptoms were severe in 2.0% of patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily and in 1.3% of patients receiving contro l regimens. In clinical studies 2.1% of patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz discontinued therapy because of nervous system symptoms. Nervous system symptoms usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks. Nervous system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals po ssibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms (see section 4.2). Analysis of long-term data from a clinical study (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm. Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with he patic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). HIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: limited HBV (n=13) or HCV (n=26) in HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection. However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population. Amylase: in clinical studies, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels > 1.5 times the ULN were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz and 6% of patients treated with control regimens. The clinical significance of asymptomati c increases in serum amylase is unknown. Lipids, lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been with metabolic such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin-resistance, hyperglycaemia and hy perlactataemia (see section 4.4). Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4). Immune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4). Cannabinoid test interaction: efavirenz does not bind to cannabi noid receptors. False positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported in uninfected volunteers who received efavirenz. False positive test results have only been observed with the CEDIA DAU Multi-Level THC assay, which is 25 used for screening, and have not been observed w ith other cannabinoid assays tested including tests used for confirmation of positive results. Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). 4.9 Overdose Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg efaviren z twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no specific antidote for overdose with efavirenz. Sin ce efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to remove significant quantities of it from blood. Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approxima tely 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by haemodialysis. It is not known whether emtricitabi ne or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for tr eatment of combinations, code: J05AR06 Mechanism of action: efavirenz is an NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz non-competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and does not significantl y inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) RT form emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. Emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HI V-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination. Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir di phosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo . Antiviral activity in vitro: efavirenz demonstrated antiviral ac tivity against most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, D, F, G, J, and N) but ha d reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses. Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O. Both emtricitabine and tenofovir showed strain specific activity agains t HIV-2 and antiviral activity against HBV. In combination studies evaluating the in vitro antiviral activity of efavirenz and emtricitabine together, efavirenz and tenofovir together, and emtricitabine and tenofovir together, a dditive to synergistic antiviral effects were observed. 26 Resistance: resistance to efavirenz can be selected in vitro and resulted in single or multiple amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 RT, including L100I, V108I, V179D, and Y181C. K103N was the most frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolat es from patients who experienced rebound in viral load during clinical studies of efavirenz. Substitu tions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequenc ies, and often only in combination with K103N. Cross-resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in vitro demonstrated that the K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the different binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme targets involved. Resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development of an M184V or M184I subs titution in RT with emtricitabine or a K65R substitution in RT with tenofovir. No other pathwa ys of resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir have been identified. Emtricitabine-resistant viruses w ith the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also be selected by abacavir or dida nosine and results in re duced susceptibility to these lamivudine, emtricitabi ne and tenofovir. Tenofovir disopr oxil fumarate in patients HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutati on. Both the K65R and M184V/I mutation remain fully susceptible to efavirenz. Patients with HIV-1 expressing three or more thym idine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that included either an M41L or an L210W substitution in RT showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In vivo resistance (antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients): extremely limited resistance data from patients treated with Atripla are currently available. Howe ver, in a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study as individual formulat ions (or as efavirenz and the fixed combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir dis oproxil fumarate (Truvada) from week 96 to 144), genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patie nts with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml at week 144 or early study drug discontinuation (see section on Clinical experience ). As of week 144: The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10. 5%) isolates analysed from in the efavirenz fumarate efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group (p-value < 0.05, Exact test comparing the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all subjects). No virus analysed contained the K65R mutation. Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 13/19 (68%) patients efavirenz + emtric itabine fumarate group 21/29 (72%) patients in the efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group. A summary of resistance mutation development is shown in Table 5. 27 Table 5: Development of resistance in study GS-01-934 through 0.05, Fisher's fumarate group to efavirenz + la mivudine/zidovudine group among all patients. 1 Other efavirenz resistance mutations D67N (n=1) and K70R (n=1). Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteris tics for the individual components for additional information regarding in vivo resistance with these medicinal products. Clinical experience In a 144-week open-label randomised clinical st udy (GS-01-934) antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected patients received either a once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fixed combination lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir) administered twice daily and efavirenz once daily (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Truvada). Patients who completed 144 weeks of treatment with either treatment arm in study GS-01-934 were given the option to continue in an open-label extended phase of the study with Atripla on an empty stomach. Preliminary 24-week data are available from a total of 286 patients who changed to Atripla: 160 had had previously received Combivir and efavirenz. The majority of patients from both initial treatment groups maintained virologic supp ression after changing to Atripla. In 91% of the patients the HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations re mained < 50 copies/ml and in 97% < 400 copies/ml, after 24 weeks of Atripla treatment (intention to treat analysis (ITT), missing=failure). Study AI266073 was a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients comparing the efficacy of Atripla to antiretrovira l therapy consisting of at least two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; not and tenofovir disopr oxil fumarate). Atripla was administered on an empty stomach (see section 4.2). Patients had never experienced virologi cal failure on a previous antiretroviral therapy, had no known HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to any of the three components within Atripla, and had been virologically suppressed for at least thre e months at baseline. Patients either changed to Atripla (N=203) or continued on their original antir etroviral treatment regimen (N=97). Forty-eight 28 week data showed that high levels of virologic suppression, comparable to the original treatment regimen, were maintained in patients who were randomised to change to Atripla (see Table 6). Table 6: 48-week efficacy data from study AI266073 in which Atripla was administered to virologically suppressed patients on combination antiretroviral therapy Treatment group Endpoint Atripla (N=203) n/N (%) Stayed on original treatment regimen (N=97) n/N (%) Difference between Atripla and original treatment regimen (95%CI) patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 Kaplan Meier (KM) method M: Missing Modified LOCF: Post-hoc analysis where patients who failed virologically or discontinued for adverse events were treated as failures; for other drop-outs, the LOCF (last observation carried forward) method was applied When the two strata were analysed separately, res ponse rates in the stratum with prior PI-treatment were numerically lower for patients switched to Atri pla [92.4% versus 94.0% for the PVR (sensitivity analysis) for Atripla respectively; (95%CI) of -1.6% 6.7%)]. the stratum, vs 97.4% for Atripla (95%CI) of 1.4% (-4.0%, 6.9%). No data are currently available from clinical studi es with Atripla in treatment-na\u00efve patients or in heavily pretreated patients. There is no clini cal experience with Atripla in patients who are experiencing virological failure in a first-line antiret roviral treatment regimen or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV : limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection al so results in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log 10 reduction or 4 to 5 log 10 reduction, respectively) (see section 4.4). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The separate pharmaceutical forms of efavirenz, emtr icitabine and tenofovir disoproxil and tenofov ir disoproxil fumarate, administered separately in HIV infected patients. The bioequivalence of one Atripla film-coated tablet with one efavirenz 600 mg film-coated tablet plus one emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule plus one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet (equi valent to 300 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) administered together, was established following singl e dose administration to fasting healthy subjects in study GS-US-177-0105 (see Table 7). 29 Table 7: Summary of 18.9 (20.8) 17.8 (22.6) Test: single fixed-dose combination tablet taken under fasted conditions. Reference: single dose of a 600 mg efavirenz tablet, 200 mg emtricitabine capsule and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet taken under fasted conditions. Values for Test and Reference are m ean (% coefficient of variation). GMR=geometric least-squares mean ratio, CI=confidence interval Absorption: in HIV infected patients, peak efavirenz pl asma concentrations were attained by 5 hours and steady-state concentrations reached in 6 to 7 days. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady-state peak concentration (C max) was 12.9 \u00b1 3.7 \u00b5M was was 184 \u00b1 73 \u00b5Mh (40%). Emtricitabine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. Following multiple dose oral administration of emtricita bine to 20 HIV infected patients, steady-state C max 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5g/ml \u00b5gh/ml (31%) over a 24 hour dosing interval. Following oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to HIV-1 infected patients in the fasted state, maximum tenofovir concentrations were achieved within one hour and the C max and AUC (mean \u00b1 S.D.) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in fasted patients was approximately 25%. Effect of food: Atripla has not been evaluated in the presence of food. Administration of efavirenz capsules with a hi gh fat meal increased the mean AUC and C max of efavirenz by 28% and 79%, respectively, compared to administration in a fasted state. Compared to fasted administration, dosing of tenofovir disoprox il fumarate and emtricitabi ne in combination with either a high fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC and C max of tenofovir by 35% and 15%, respectively without affecting emtricitabine exposures. Atripla is recommended for administration on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure will be approximately 35% lower following administration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenof ovir disoproxil fumarate when taken with food. Forty-eight week data fro m a clinical study (AI266073) showed maintenance of virologic suppression for patients who had stable virologic suppression on combination 30 antiretroviral therapy and subsequently changed to Atripla with a recommendation for administration of Atripla on an empty stomach. Distribution: efavirenz is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma protei ns is < 4% and independent of concentrations over the range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/ml. Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine was approximately 1.4 l/kg. Afte r oral administration, emtricitabine is widely distributed throughout the body. The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was approximately 1.0 and the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum protein is < 0.7% and 7.2%, respectively over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 \u00b5g/ml. Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution of tenofovir was approximately 800 m l/kg. After oral administration, tenofovir is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally me tabolised by the cytochrome P450 system hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isoenzymes responsible fo r efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibits P450 isoenzymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. In in vitro studies did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentr ations well above those achieved clinically. Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in pa tients with homozygous G 516T genetic variant of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. The clinical implicati ons of such an association are unknown; however, the potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be excluded. Efavirenz has been shown to induce P450 enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism. In uninfected volunteers, multiple doses of 200 to 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation (22 to 42% lower) a nd a shorter terminal half-life of 40 to 55 hours (single dose half-life 52 to 76 hours). There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the to form the 3'-sulphoxi de diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O -glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro studies have determined that neither tenofovir disopr oxil fumarate nor tenofovir enzymes. Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation. Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transfer ase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. Elimination: efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses (see also data from bioequivalence study described above) and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 14 to 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. Following oral administration, the elimination half-lif e of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14% ). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 307 ml/min. Following oral administration, the elimination half- life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system with approximately 70 to 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous administration. The apparent clearance of tenof ovir averaged approximately 307 ml/min. Renal 31 clearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 ml/min, which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir. Age, gender and ethnicity: the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir are similar in male and female patients. Although limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir in the elderly (over 65 years). Pharmacokinetic studies with Atripla have not been performed in infants and children (see section 4.2). Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of the separate pharmaceutical forms or as Atripla have not been studied in HIV infected patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of single doses of the individual preparations of emtric itabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected patients with varying degrees of renal impairment . The degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (normal renal function when creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min; mild impairment with creatinine clearance=50 to 79 ml/min; moderate impairment with creatinine clearance=30 to 49 ml/min and severe impairment with creatinine clearance=10 to 29 ml/min). The mean (%CV) emtricitabine exposure increased from 12 \u00b5gh/ml (25%) in subjects with normal renal function to 20 (6%), 25 \u00b5gh/ml ( 23%) and 34 \u00b5gh/ml (6%) in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The mean (%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 ngh/ml (12%) in in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 \u00b5gh/ml (19%) of emtricitabine, and over 48 hours (29%) of tenofovir. The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studi ed in patients with renal impairment. However, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unc hanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on exposure to efaviren z is likely to be minimal. Atripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min). Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir di soproxil fumarate that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Hepatic impairment: the pharmacokinetics of Atripla have not been studied in HIV infected patients with hepatic impairment. Atripla should be administered with caution to patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Atripla must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). In the single patient studied with severe hepatic impa irment (CPT, Grade C), half-life of efavirenz was doubled indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation. 32 The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabi ne have not been studied in non-HBV infected patients with varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency. In genera l, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected patients were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients. A single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered to non-HIV infected patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defi ned according to CPT classification. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantia lly altered in subjects with hepa tic impairment suggesting that no dose adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil fu marate is required in these subjects. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foet uses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz con centrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalm ia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, micro-ophthalmia was observed in another foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus. Efavirenz induced foetal resorptions in rats. No malformations were observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. Conventional reproductive/developmental toxicity st udies with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate revealed no special hazard for humans. Carcinogenicity studies using efavirenz showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in male mice. Th e mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for humans are not known. Carcinogenic ity studies using efavirenz in male mice and in male and female rats were nega tive. While the carcinogenic potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efaviren z outweighs the potential carcinogenic risk to humans. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not show a ny carcinogenic potential in a long-term oral carcinogenicity study in rats. A long-term oral car cinogenicity study in mice showed a low incidence of duodenal tumours, considered likely related to high local concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract at a dose of 600 mg/kg/day. While the mechanism of tumour formation is uncertain, the findings are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. Emtricitabine did not show any carcinogenic pot ential in long-term studies in rats and mice. Efavirenz and emtricitabine were negative in c onventional genotoxic assays. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was positive in two out of three in vitro genotoxicity studies but negative in the in vivo micronucleus assay. The combination of emtricitabi ne and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, with comparable results to those obtained for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone. The combination of em tricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay). Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fo ld greater than those in humans given the recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regresse d upon cessation of dosing. Biliary fibrosis has been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsi ons were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz for 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Preclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys revealed effects on bone and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (rats and do gs). Findings in the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substan ce-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with potential secondary re duction in bone mineral density. The mechanisms of these toxicities are not completely understood. 33 A one month dog study using the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovi r disoproxil fumarate found no exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to the separate components. 6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET 43 LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER Atripla tablets disoproxil Read all of this leaflet carefully be fore you start taking this medicine. - Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. - If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. - This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. - If any of the side effects get serious, or if you no tice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist. In this leaflet: 1. What Atripla is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Atripla 3. How to take Atripla 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Atripla 6. Further information 1. WHAT ATRIPLA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Atripla contains three active substances that are used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: - Efavirenz is a transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) Each of these active substances, also known as antiret roviral medicines, work by interfering with an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to multiply. Atripla is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 and over who have previously been treated with othe r antiretroviral medicines and have their HIV-1 infection under control for at least three months. Patients must not have experienced failure of a previous HIV therapy. 2. BEFORE YOU TAKE ATRIPLA Do not take Atripla - if you are to efavirenz, emtric itabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or any of the other ingredients of Atripla listed at the end of this leaflet. - if you have severe liver disease. - if you are currently taking any of the following medicines: - astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat hay fever or other allergies) - bepridil (used to treat heart disease) - cisapride (used to treat heartburn) - ergot alkaloids (for dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and (used treat migraines and cluster headaches) - midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) - pimozide (used to treat certain mental conditions) 44 - St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum ) (a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) - voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections) If you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately. Taking these medicines with Atripla could cause serious or life-threateni ng side effects or stop these medicines from working properly. Take special care with Atripla - Women should not get pregnant during t reatment with Atripla and for 12 weeks thereafter (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding ). - Do not give Atripla to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Atripla in children and adolescents has not yet been studied. - You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, so it is important to take precautions to avoid infecting other people through sexual contact or blood transfer. This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Atripla you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. - You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Atripla. - Tell your doctor: - if you are taking other medicines that emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Atripla should not be taken with any of these medicines. - if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys. Atripla is not recommended if you have moderate to severe kidney disease. Atripla may affect your kidneys. Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function. Your doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. Atripla is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Taking other medicines ). If this is unavoidable, yo ur doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. - if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have strange thoughts (see Section 4, Possible side effects ). - if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor ma y need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking Atripla. Your doctor may give you a different anticonvulsant. - if you have a history of liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis. Patients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with combination antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working. If you have severe liver disease, do not take Atripla (see earlier in Section 2, Do not take Atripla). 45 If you have hepatitis B infection, symptoms may become worse after discontinuation of Atripla. Your doctor may then conduct blood tests at regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see Section 3, If you stop taking Atripla). - if you are diabetic, overweight or have high cholesterol. Combination antiretroviral therapies (including Atripla) may raise blood sugar levels, increase blood fats (hyperlipaemia), cause changes to body fat, and resistance to insulin (see Section 4, Possible side effects ). - if you are over 65. Insufficient numbers of patients over 65 years of age have been studied. If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed Atripla, your doctor will monitor you carefully. - Once you start taking Atripla, look out for: - possible signs of lactic acidosis. Some HIV medicines, including Atripla, that contain nucleoside analogues can cause lactic acidosis (excess of lactic acid in your blood), together with an enlarged liver. Deep, rapid breathing, drowsiness, and symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), vomiting and stomach pain , might indicate the development of lactic acidosis. This rare but serious side effect has occasionally been fatal. Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particul arly if they are very overweight, and people with liver disease. While you are being treat ed with Atripla, your doctor will monitor you closely for any signs that you may be developing lactic acidosis. If you notice any symptoms of lactic acidosis, please tell your doctor immediately. - signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. - any signs of skin rash. Rashes may be caused by Atripla. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop ta king Atripla and tell your doctor at once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at higher risk of getting a rash with Atripla. - any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic inf ection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to impr ovement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor at once. - bone problems . Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. Bone problems (sometimes resulting in fractur es) may also occur in patients who develop damage to kidney tubule cells (see Section 4, Possible side effects ). Taking other medicines You must not take Atripla with certain medicines. These are listed under Do not take Atripla, at the start of Section 2. They include some common medicines and some herbal remedies (including St. John's wort) which can cause serious interactions. 46 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes non-prescription medicines and herbal remedies. Also, Atripla should not be taken with any other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines which may damage your kidneys. Some examples include: - aminoglycosides, vancomycin (medic ines for bacterial infections) - foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (medicines for viral infections) - amphotericin B, pentamidine (medicines for fungal infections) - interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) Atripla may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Atripla or other medicines in your blood may be affected. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: - Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): taking Atripla with other antiviral medicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Inflammation of the panc reas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, ha ve been reported rarely when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and dida nosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with medicines containing tenofovir and didanosine. - Other medicines used for saquinavir. Your doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease inhibitors. - Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin. Atripla can reduce the amount of statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider changing th e dose of your statin, if needed. - Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital. Atripla can reduce the amount of the anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine can reduce the amount of efavirenz, one of the components of Atripla, in your blood. Your doctor may need to consid er giving you a different anticonvulsant. - Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including AIDS-related mycobacterium avium complex: clarithromycin, ri fabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may need to consider changing your dose or giving you an a lternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor may consider giving you an additional dose of efavirenz to treat your HIV infection. - Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): itraconazole. Atripla can reduce the amount of itraconazole in your blood. Your docto r may need to consider giving you a different antifungal. - Hormonal contraceptives (e.g. th e pill or contraceptive implant). Because the potential for efavirenz, a component of Atripla, to interact with hormonal contraceptives has not been fully studied, a reliable method of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) should always be used in addition to the hormonal contraceptive (see Section Pregnancy and breast-feeding ). - Methadone, a medicine used to treat opiate addiction, as your doctor may need to change your methadone dose. - Sertraline, a medicine used to treat depression, as your doctor may need to change your dose of sertraline. - Diltiazem or similar medicines (c alled calcium channel blockers): when you start taking Atripla, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. - Medicines containing tacrolimus (a medicine used to prevent organ transplant rejection, also called immunosuppressant). When you start or stop taking Atripla your doctor will closely monitor your plasma levels of tacrolim us and may need to adjust its dose. 47 Pregnancy and breast-feeding Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Atripla and for 12 weeks thereafter . Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with Atripla. If you could get pregnant while receiving Atripla , you need to use a reliable form of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other met hods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants , injection). Efavirenz, one of the active components of Atripla, may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue to use contraceptive measures, as a bove, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Atripla. Tell your doctor immediately if you are p regnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are pregnant, you should take Atripla only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn an imals and in the babies of women treated with efavirenz during pregnancy. If you have taken Atripla during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic t ests to monitor the development of your child. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Do not breast-feed during treatment with Atripla. Both HIV and the ingredients of Atripla may pass through breast milk and cause serious harm to your baby. Driving and using machines No studies on the effects on the ability to dr ive and use machines have been performed. Atripla may cause dizziness, impaired concentration and drowsiness. If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. Important information about some of the ingredients of Atripla This medicine contains 1 mmol (23.6 mg) of s odium per tablet which should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. 3. HOW TO TAKE ATRIPLA Always take Atripla exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual dose for adults is one tablet taken each day by mout h. Atripla should be taken on an empty stomach (commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Swallow Atripla whole with water. Atripla must be taken every day. It can help to take Atripla at bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) less troublesome. If your doctor decides to stop one of the components of Atripla, you may be given efavirenz, emtricitabine and/or tenofovir dis oproxil separately or with other medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. 48 If you take more Atripla than you should If you accidentally take too many Atripla tablets, c ontact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. If you forget to take Atripla It is important not to miss a dose of Atripla. If you do miss a dose of Atripla, take it as soon as you can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. If it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. If you throw up the tablet (just after taking Atripla) , you should take another tablet. Do not wait until your next dose is due. If you stop taking Atripla Don't stop taking Atripla without talking to your doctor. Stopping Atripla can seriously affect your response to future treatment. If Atripla is stoppe d, speak to your doctor before you restart taking Atripla tablets. Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Atripla separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. When your supply of Atripla starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Atripla treatment without talking to your doctor first. Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (two of the three components of Atripla). If Atripla is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may re quire blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as th is may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 4.

The cause and the long-ter m effects of these changes are not yet known. Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause in creased fat levels in the blood (hyperlipaemia) and resistance to insulin. Your doctor will test for these changes.
