With every pregnancy there is a 3 to 5% risk of having a baby with a birth defect. What are herbal medicines? Herbal medicines are products made from pl ants that are used for health reasons1. It is common for women to use herbal medications for specific pregnancy or breastfeeding issues , health promotion and to treat general conditions such as colds and gynaecological problems2. Issues for pregnancy and breastfeeding Herbal medicine in Australia is generally not regulated as strictly as conventional medicines (prescription and over the counter medications) 3. This means that ingredients listed on the label of herbal medicines, may not always accurately reflect the actual contents of the product4. Therefore, if you use any herbal medicine, make sure that your product is from a reputable source . Herbal medicin es like conventional medicines, may cross the placenta in pregnancy and transfer into your milk wh ile breastfeeding. In this way herbal medicines may reach your baby's bloodstream an d transfer ingredients that may be potentially harmful . Furthermore, even though herbal medicines are derived from plants they may interact with other medicines and have ha rmful side effects similar to conventional medication. Unlike many conventional medicines, there is often limited specific safety information for most herbs, particularly regarding use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Many herbal medicines have been us ed traditionally and knowledge regarding safety is often based on practitioner experience rather than scientific research1.There is also no requirement for herbal treatments to be evaluated for their effectiveness. It is important to discuss any herbal med ication you are taking with your midwife, GP or obstetrician. Common herbal medications used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding Ginger Ginger has been used traditionally to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Several studies have found ginger to be both effective and safe in doses of approximately 1g daily1. Significantly higher doses should be avoided due to lack of safety information. Echinacea Echinacea is often used in the management of colds. Although it is widely used, there is limited infor mation r egarding its safety during pregnancy. One study has been published which found no increased risk of miscarriage or birth defects in children of women who took Echinacea throughout their pregnancy1. Although this is reassuring, more research is requ ired to confirm its safety. There is little information regarding the safety of Echinacea while breastfeeding. Raspberry leaf Raspberry leaf is frequently used in pregnancy as it has traditionally been thought to aid labour. There has been only a small am ount of research regarding its use in pregnancy. In general these studies have found raspberry leaf t o be safe but also to be ineffective. Thus it cannot be specifically recommended5. St. John's Wort (Hypericum) St. John's Wort has been used traditionally to treat depression. Several small studies have indicated that it may be safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. However further research is For more information call MotherSafe: NSW Medica tions in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Service on 9382 6539 (Sydney Metropolitan Area) or 1800 647 848 (Non -Metropolitan Area) Monday -Friday 9am -5pm (excluding public holidays) required to confirm this. If you are breastfeeding, be aware that St. John's Wort is a lo ng acting medication and any medication your baby would receive through your milk would remain in your baby's circulation for a long time. St John's Wort also has the potential to interact with many other medications (including some antidepressants) so cau tion is recommended6. It is important to see a health professional if you are feeling depressed or anxious. Cranberry Cranberry juice has been used traditionally to prevent urinary tract infections. Although there is limited information regarding safety an d effectiveness in pregnancy and breastfeeding, it is expected to be safe in recommended amounts6. However, inadequately treated urinary tract infections can have serious consequences so it is important to see your doctor if you have urinary symptoms. Lysine Lysine is an amino acid normally present in food. It is commonly used as a supplement to treat and prevent herpes simplex infections although its effectiveness has not been proven . There is no information regarding safety in pregnancy or breastfeeding, but it is not anticipated to be harmful7. However, transmission of herpes simplex to a baby can have serious consequences so it is important to treat herpes effective ly. Fenugreek Fenugreek has traditionally been used by women to increase their breastmilk supply. Research supports its use in some, but not all studies. In general, babies appear to have few side effects if Fenugreek is taken by their mothers while breastfeeding8. However, breastmilk supply is most likely to be improved by general supportive breastfeeding measures rather than medication, so it is advisable to seek help first from a healthcare professional with expertise in breastfeeding or an organisation such as the Australian Breastfeeding Association (see below). Herbal ingredients not lis ted above should be treated with caution due to lack of definitive evidence . Nonethe less, it is considered safe to consume herbal teas in moderation .
