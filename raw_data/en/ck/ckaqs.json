Today we are focusing on supplements for overall wellness.", "sitename": "Doterra", "date": "2017-07-20", "cleaned_text": "While there is no complete replacement for a healthy diet and exercise program, [today's modern diet does not provide the nutrients we need](https://doterra.com/US/en/brochures-magazines-doterra-living-spring-2015-the-multivitamin-revolution) to not only stay healthy, but also have energy and prevent premature aging. Enter the [doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-lifelong-vitality-pack), [doTERRA a2z Chewable](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-a2z-chewable), and [IQ Mega\u00ae](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/iq-mega). These are all supplements meant to be used on a daily basis in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This is not to say that other supplements cannot be used on a regular basis, but these specific supplements are meant for anyone to use on a daily basis. The doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack Including Alpha CRS+\u00ae, Microplex VMz\u00ae, and xEO Mega\u00ae the doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack is one of doTERRA's most popular products. You've heard that this combination of supplements is a complete dietary foundation for a lifetime of wellness. But how does that work? Find out below: - [Alpha CRS+](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/alpha-crs-plus) Every day, our DNA and other cells are under attack from free radicals that damage them. Alpha CRS+ combats this, and stimulates overall cellular health.* For this reason, Alpha CRS+ is also known as the cellular energy and longevity blend.* Some of the nutrients included in the formula are coenzyme Q10 and acetyl-l-carnitine, which help the metabolic processes of the cell to give you more energy.* There are also antioxidants like quercetin and alpha-lipoic acid that help combat oxidative stress and premature aging.* Finally, a botanical extract of Ginko biloba helps support mental clarity and energy.* Other information: \"Alpha\" is a word meaning first, while CRS is an acronym standing for \"Cellular Renewal System.\" The plus sign was added to emphasize improvements made to the original product. The formula is GMO and gluten free and does not contain milk, wheat, or animal products. For a full list of the specific benefits of this supplement, [see this blog post](https://doterra.com/US/en/blog/spotlight-alpha-crs-plus). - [Microplex VMz](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/supplements-daily-vitality-microplex-vmz-food-nutrient-complex) This complex contains natural highly bioavailable vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in proportions that work hand-in-hand with your diet. (For example, vitamins A, C, and E, B, and D, and the minerals calcium, magnesium, and zinc.) Often, vitamins and minerals included in supplements can be difficult for our bodies to absorb. However, Microplex VMz solves the absorption issue by using a glycoprotein matrix to help the body absorb vitamins, and chelated minerals (meaning the mineral is bound to an amino acid). In essence, this process makes the supplement recognizable as food nutrients to our digestive systems.* Overall Microplex VMz supports healthy metabolism, digestion, immune function and cellular energy.* Other information: The name is a combination of the words \"micronutrient\" and \"complex.\" VM stands for vitamins and minerals, and \"z\" is for the improvements made to the original product. - [xEO Mega](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/xeo-mega) xEO Mega takes care of your remaining nutritional needs with omega-3s (known as essential fatty acids), essential oils, and vitamins D and E. Fatty acids help support your joints, skin, and cardiovascular and brain health.* The best sources of omega-3s are fatty fish and marine algae, which are not common in most diets and can be expensive. The molecularly filtered fish oil in xEO Mega supplies 300 mg of EPA and 300 mg of DHA per daily serving, and 65 mg of other omega-3s. It is also formulated with a blend of Clove, Frankincense, Thyme, Cumin, Wild Orange, Peppermint, Ginger, Caraway, & German Chamomile oils, that add antioxidant protection to the mix.* Other Information: The complex includes a microalgae carotenoid extract of pure astaxanthin which is clinically shown to provide powerful antioxidant and circulatory benefits, support eye health, improve muscle strength and endurance, support skin health, and modulate healthy immune function.* For more details about xEO Mega, [see this product spotlight](https://doterra.com/US/en/blog/spotlight-xeo-mega). Dose: It is recommended to take four capsules of each supplement with a meal, but you can alternately take two of each supplement with breakfast, and two of each with dinner. Although you can take any of these supplements separately, we recommend using them together. Taken together, all three supplements provide the antioxidant capacity of 12 or more servings of fruit and vegetables.* The doTERRA Vegan Lifelong Vitality Pack Alpha CRS+ is automatically vegan, and is included along with [vEO Mega\u00ae](https://doterra.com/US/en/blog/spotlight-veo-mega), (the vegan xEO Mega) and the new [Vegan Microplex VMz\u00ae](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/vegan-microplex-vmz). The ingredients in the vegan supplements were chosen for their similar benefits to the regular doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack options. doTERRA a2z Chewable & IQ Mega\u00ae For children four or older, doTERRA recommends a2z Chewable and IQ Mega. While an adult may take these supplements, these products are intended to help children start on the foundation for lifelong wellness. - [doTERRA a2z Chewable](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/doterra-a2z-chewable) These chewable vitamins are perfect for kids that do not easily swallow pills. The concept here is similar to what the doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack provides. The supplement includes a blend of bioavailable minerals including calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese. It is also formulated with the Alpha CRS+ blend, and antioxidant vitamins A, C, E, along with a cellular energy complex of B vitamins.* With the final addition of a superfood blend, a2z is the ideal supplement for kid's growing bodies, or for adults that find swallowing pills difficult. Dose: Take 2 tablets daily with meals. Adults may take up to 3 tablets daily. - [IQ Mega](https://doterra.com/US/en/p/iq-mega) IQ Mega is designed to take along with the doTERRA a2z Chewable. This unique fish oil supplement has the added benefit of being flavored with Wild Orange. It helps sustain healthy cardiovascular and nervous system function, while supporting healthy joint function as well.* IQ Mega also provides important nutrients for healthy immune function, and supports healthy function of the brain and eyes.* Dose: Take 1 teaspoon daily "}
