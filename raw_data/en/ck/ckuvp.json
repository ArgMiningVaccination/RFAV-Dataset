Your throat may feel dry and look red, and your voice may sound hoarse. Sore throat is common because it is associated with the [common cold.](https://mydr.com.au/respiratory-health/common-cold) A sore throat can be caused by bacteria or viruses and will usually clear up on its own after a few days. Antibiotics are not usually needed. However, sore throats may be due to streptococcal bacteria (one cause of [tonsillitis](https://mydr.com.au/respiratory-health/tonsillitis)). If this type of infection in children and adolescents is not treated it can sometimes lead to rheumatic fever (an inflammatory disease that can affect many organs of the body). Sore throats can also be caused by stomach acid reflux, by something lodged in your throat or by smoke irritation. See Your Pharmacist or Medical Professional - if the person with the sore throat is under 12 years old - if you have difficulty breathing or talking - if you have a high fever, i.e. a temperature above 39\u00b0C (or 38\u00b0C for children) - if you have an earache, swollen glands, a rash or have been vomiting - if you have fatigue or malaise - if your sore throat has lasted for more than a week, or keeps coming back - if you have swallowing problems that have lasted for more than two weeks - if it is difficult to swallow because your throat feels blocked - if there are white spots of pus on your tonsils or the back of your mouth - if there are white patches inside your mouth, especially if you have diabetes or asthma and use a steroid (preventer) inhaler, as this may be a sign of oral thrush - if you are taking prescription medications; in rare cases, a sore throat can be a sign of serious side effects - if you have an artificial heart valve or have had endocarditis or rheumatic fever Treatment Tips - taking a pain relief medicine regularly will ease the pain - sucking on an ice cube or gargling a glass of warm water with a teaspoon of salt dissolved in it may help - throat lozenges, syrups, sprays and gargles can reduce discomfort.
