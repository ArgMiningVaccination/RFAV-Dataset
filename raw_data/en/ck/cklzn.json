What Causes Ear Infections In Dogs? These are some of the most common types of ear issues for dogs.

You may notice a bad-smelling yellow or greenish discharge. Foreign Bodies Your dog can pick up grass seeds or foxtails, a bug, water from swimming, dirt in her ears or even Iicks, maggots, and bee or wasp stings. You may see her shaking her head ... but debris in the ears can cause irritation, bacteria or yeast overgrowth. Aural Hematoma If your dog shakes her head or scratches it too hard, she can cause an aural hematoma. It's when a pool of blood forms between the skin and the ear flap cartilage. Most vets will recommend surgery ... but don't rush into it! There are gentler treatment options. Ear Mites [Ear mites](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/ear-mites-in-dogs-natural-remedies/) are a parasite infection that's a type of mange Dogs with ear mites will often shake their heads and scratch their ears. They're common in young dogs and very contagious, so you'll want to treat them fast. You can usually identify mites by the \"coffee-ground\" discharge they leave in the ear. The outer ear may also have reddish crustiness. But an ear infection is rarely just an ear infection. Like other skin conditions, ear infections are often a symptom of an deeper problem. Preventing Ear Infections These are some things you can change to help prevent your dog's ear infections. These are very important changes to make if your dog gets recurring or chronic ear infections. Diet Diet is a huge factor, especially if your dog eats kibble, which is high in carbohydrates and synthetic ingredients. Starchy foods feed the natural yeast in your dog's body so it grows out of balance. It's always important to feed your dog a fresh, raw and organic diet if you can. Supplements If you give your dog supplements, choose natural food-based products without fillers or additives. The most important supplement you can give to help support your dog's overall health is pre and probiotics. Minimize Pharmaceuticals And Other Chemicals Dogs who live a more natural lifestyle are less likely to develop ear infections. Try to minimize exposure to chemicals in your dog's environment, indoors and outside. Vaccines, antibiotics and other medications, and chemical pest preventives all harm your dog's gut health and disrupt her immune system. Make sure you only give the vaccines your dog really needs to protect her. Use natural alternatives to antibiotics and other medications when you can, and use natural pest prevention to keep the bugs off your dog. You can also reduce toxins by minimizing chemicals at home and in your yard. Choose natural shampoos to bathe your dog, avoid toxic cleaning products in your home, including your own body cosmetics and other products with artificial fragrances. Immune Support If your dog has chronic ear infections, a food allergy or intolerance, or environmental allergies, her immune system needs support. You'll need to get to the bottom of your dog's allergies to resolve her ear issues. There are many ways to help manage your dog's allergies but, like ear infections, you need to find the root cause. Gut health is the foundation of immune health. Manage Gut Health Ears are a window to your dog's digestive health. When something is wrong with your dog's ears, it means her immune system needs help. About 90% of your dog's immune system lives in her gut ... so gut health leads to overall health. One problem you'll want to rule out is leaky gut. Many dogs with frequent ear infections have leaky gut. Toxins and bad bacteria in the body harm the cells that line your dog's gut. This lets unwanted food particles, bacteria and toxins into the bloodstream, which can lead to many chronic health problems. Excessive Ear Cleaning Healthy ears shouldn't need cleaning. A little wax in the ears is normal so it's better to leave them alone unless your dog is uncomfortable. Over-cleaning disrupts the delicate balance of bacteria in the ear and can lead to skin irritation and inflammation. It's especially important to avoid using a medicated or veterinary cleaning solution. If you do need to clean your dog's ears, wipe them out with a little organic witch hazel on a cotton ball. Never use anything smaller than your finger inside your dog's ear (don't use a cotton swab or you'll risk damaging the ear canal). Other Chronic Disease A chronic medical condition like [hypothyroidism](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/natural-treatments-for-hypothyroidism-in-dogs/) or autoimmune disease can also contribute to ear infections. You'll want to work with your holistic vet to manage these problems. Are Some Dog Breeds More Susceptible To Ear Infections? Any dog can get ear infections, but they're more common in floppy eared dogs. These dogs' ears create a cozy environment for bacteria. Some dogs like Poodles get them because dense hair traps moisture in the ear canal. Cocker Spaniels have more secretory glands than other dogs. And ear conformation in breeds like Shar-peis is also a factor. Long-Term Approach To Ear Infections In Dogs If your dog has frequent ear infections, follow the prevention steps above and make food and lifestyle changes that'll help you get rid of the problem. You may want to work with your holistic vet to find the best approach for your dog. How can I treat my dogs ear infection at home? You can easily manage ear infections like otitis externa with natural ear infection remedies including mullein drops, green tea, apple cider vinegar and calendula. For deeper ear issues (otitis media and interna), you may need to ask your holistic vet if you're not sure which type of infection your dog has. Will dog ear infection go away on its own? Otitis externa can progress to otitis media, and in some cases, that could develop into otitis interna. So it's important to deal with ear infections promptly before they become more serious. In severe cases, your dog could develop facial paralysis, deafness, or symptoms of vestibular disease. You'll need to be patient with the healing process when you're dealing with chronic ear issues in your dog. As your dog releases toxins through her ears, remember that this is an important part of healing. The ears are one way your dog's own healing power [gets rid of toxins](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/5-tips-for-detoxing-your-dog-from-lifes-daily-toxins/). You don't want to suppress that process. Any drug or herb that can stop symptoms fast is likely to suppress them. This drives them deeper into the body where they can cause more serious issues later. The recommendations above will give you some natural tools to manage both acute and chronic ear infections in your dog. "}
