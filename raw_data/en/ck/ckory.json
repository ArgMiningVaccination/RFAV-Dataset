As a disease slowly take out the population, science and the people look for the root cause of the disease in order to control and stop it in its tracks. The world commonly sees Asia or specifically East Asia as to where most diseases and pandemics can be linked to.

There Influenza Influenza is a contagious respiratory infection that is caused by influenza virus. Influenza is commonly called flu. Many people underestimate influenza, and think it is a mild disease. In fact, influenza is a deadly disease if it has not taken care of. For example, from 1918 to 1919 about 20million people died from influenza(1). To better understand influenza, it is important to know how it spreads, how is it prevented, and the strains it has. Influenza is an infectious illness that can be spread from one individual to the next. It can be transmitted by means of saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. It can also be spread by coming in contact with the virus on contaminated surfaces. Influenza is responsible for an average of 36,000 deaths and for more than 226,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. (Davidson, 2007-2009, Davis, 2007). "}
