It is characterized by unusual movements, cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Objective: This review was undertaken to apprehend biological pathways of Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis and its management by nature-derived products. Natural products can be lucrative for the management of HD as it shows protection against HD in pre-clinical trials. Advanced research is still required to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the known organic products and their isolated compounds in HD experimental models. Summary: Degeneration of neurons in Huntington's disease is distinguished by progressive loss of motor coordination and muscle function. This is due to the expansion of CAG trinucleotide in the first exon of the htt gene responsible for neuronal death and neuronal network degeneration in the brain. It is believed that the factors such as molecular genetics, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroglia dysfunction, protein aggregation, and altered UPS leads to HD. The defensive effect of the natural product provides therapeutic efficacy against HD. Recent reports on natural drugs have enlightened the protective role against HD via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neurofunctional regulation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-14", "cleaned_text": "Pathways and Prevention by Natural Remedies [https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101389](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101389) [Huntington's Disease and Pain: Clinical Outcome, [2](#B2-brainsci-12-01389), [3](#B3-brainsci-12-01389)]. It claims its name from a physician, George Huntington, who first described the illness in 1872 [ [4](#B4-brainsci-12-01389)]. In 1974, the first publication on HD was published [ [5](#B5-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD is the earliest genetic condition to be linked to a specific chromosome site, and it has a special place in medical genetics research [ [6](#B6-brainsci-12-01389), [7](#B7-brainsci-12-01389), [8](#B8-brainsci-12-01389), [9](#B9-brainsci-12-01389)]. [10](#B10-brainsci-12-01389), [11](#B11-brainsci-12-01389)]. Thus, early diagnosis of clinical manifestation along with meticulous management becomes crucial. [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [13](#B13-brainsci-12-01389)]. An extension within the CAG repeat tract causes a mutation in htt, resulting in longer lengths of polyglutamine (polyQ) in the encoded protein. In unaffected populations, wild-type alleles contain up to 35 CAG repetitions, whereas 36 [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [14](#B14-brainsci-12-01389), [15](#B15-brainsci-12-01389), [16](#B16-brainsci-12-01389)]. The total amount of CAG repeats, as well as the phase of appearance of symptoms, is inversely connected, i.e., larger CAG repeat extensions are related to an initial phase of onset [ [17](#B17-brainsci-12-01389), [18](#B18-brainsci-12-01389), [19](#B19-brainsci-12-01389)]. The protein encoded by the htt gene is a 348-kDa multidomain protein with a polymorphic glutamine/proline-rich domain at its amino terminus [ [20](#B20-brainsci-12-01389), [21](#B21-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD is currently the most extensively reported hereditary neurodegenerative disease that has diagnostic and prognostic genetic testing, with the probability of gene-targeted therapy in the nearby future [ [6](#B6-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD was among the first diseases to be genetically tested before birth. Certainly, neuroimaging techniques have provided predictive and diagnostic genetic screening for ailment identification and its implications on sick persons and families through specialized facilities and genetic testing procedures [ [6](#B6-brainsci-12-01389), [22](#B22-brainsci-12-01389), [23](#B23-brainsci-12-01389)]. [24](#B24-brainsci-12-01389)]. Neuroinflammation and microglial activation are hallmarks of the preliminary phase of HD [ [25](#B25-brainsci-12-01389)]. In HD plasma, the levels of IL-6, matrix metallopeptidase 9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and TGF-1 were significantly elevated, whilst the levels of IL-18 were markedly decreased. The prevalence of HD was reversely linked with plasma IL-6 [ [26](#B26-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD is a severe autosomal-dominant late-onset neurological disorder that leads to chronic and incurable motor defects, leading to difficulties with coordination and mobility in addition to psychological-behavioral abnormalities. One of HD's complications is visual deficit [ [27](#B27-brainsci-12-01389)]. [28](#B28-brainsci-12-01389), [29](#B29-brainsci-12-01389), [30](#B30-brainsci-12-01389), [31](#B31-brainsci-12-01389)]. When the retina of transgenic HD R6/1 mice was examined under an electron microscope, it was discovered that the diseased retina of HD mice is loaded with peculiar organelles called myelinosomes. Myelinosomes, which contain mutant mHTT-exon 1, can be released from glial M\u00fcller cells and then integrated into neuronal cells via a membrane fusion mechanism, aiding in the spread of HD [ [32](#B32-brainsci-12-01389)]. [33](#B33-brainsci-12-01389), [34](#B34-brainsci-12-01389)]. The intensity of symptoms and the quantity of CAG repeats were inversely connected with the levels of TRP. At the same time, the inflammatory condition was positively correlated with the levels of Anthranilic acid, which may be a useful biomarker [ [35](#B35-brainsci-12-01389)]. [36](#B36-brainsci-12-01389)]. For symptomatic care, there are numerous effective choices; however, both drug-based and non-drug-based therapy is used [ [37](#B37-brainsci-12-01389)]. Nature, as the best combinatorial chemist and home to hundreds of plant species, could have a direct medicinal influence on the body [ [5](#B5-brainsci-12-01389), [38](#B38-brainsci-12-01389)]. Natural ingredients with antioxidants, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, calcium antagonization, and neurofunctional regulatory properties have been proven to cure or treat neurodegenerative diseases [ [39](#B39-brainsci-12-01389)]. [10](#B10-brainsci-12-01389), [40](#B40-brainsci-12-01389)]. Drug-based therapy involves symptomatic treatment through various therapeutic drugs [ [41](#B41-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD therapeutic development and advancement that modulates the mHTT level through genetic transfer is one of the most important strategies to ameliorate the disease [ [42](#B42-brainsci-12-01389)]. 2. Methodology 3. Epidemiology [43](#B43-brainsci-12-01389), [44](#B44-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD is a neuropsychiatric disorder with pervasiveness of 5-10 people per one lakh in the white-skinned European-origin community. In Japan, the incidence is around one-tenth of the white-skinned of European origin population [ [45](#B45-brainsci-12-01389), [46](#B46-brainsci-12-01389)]. There is no gender predominance, and its prevalence is 5-8 per 100,000 individuals worldwide. The highest frequency of HD is found in European countries. The universality of HD ranges from 4.1 to 8.4 per lakh people estimated in the USA [ [47](#B47-brainsci-12-01389)]. In India, the universality of HD is greater and similar to that seen in Western Europe [ [48](#B48-brainsci-12-01389)]. 4. Clinical Assessment [Table 1](#brainsci-12-01389-t001). People are suffering from HD show specific and characteristic cognitive difficulties [ [49](#B49-brainsci-12-01389)]. Traditionally, this cognitive change has been stated to as dementia. Changes in behavior are a distinctive characteristic of HD, which is the most stressful facet of the circumstance for families and individuals coping with it [ [44](#B44-brainsci-12-01389), [50](#B50-brainsci-12-01389)]. Other less eminent but weakening characteristics of HD comprise unexpected weight loss, sleep, circadian rhythm problems, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. The average life span of the start of the disorder is 30 to 50 years old, with a range of 2 to 85 years, and the disease lasts 17 to 20 years on average [ [1](#B1-brainsci-12-01389), [51](#B51-brainsci-12-01389)]. 5. Developmental Stages of HD [Table 2](#brainsci-12-01389-t002)). Individuals with early-stage HD are functional. They continue to work, manage expenses, drive, and live independently. Individuals in the middle stage of HD begin to lose their power to work or drive [ [63](#B63-brainsci-12-01389)]. They cannot handle their finances or conduct household tasks, but they can eat, dress, and keep themselves clean with assistance. It becomes difficult to handle patients suffering from HD as they are unable to sequence, consolidate, or prioritize information. As the stage moves into the early advanced and advanced stage of HD, individuals need complete assistance for daily living. Although they are bedridden and non-verbal, still people with HD seem to recollect some comprehension [ [64](#B64-brainsci-12-01389)]. The total functional capacity is the most widely used rating scale based on functional abilities. A rating scale that rates the person's level of independence based on occupation, the capability to handle finance, and the capability to perform household chores [ [59](#B59-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6. Huntington's Pathogenesis: Mechanistic and Genetic Approach [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [14](#B14-brainsci-12-01389)]. Despite the information that the genetic origin of HD is well documented, the various molecular modifications investigated in HD are broad and not utterly understood [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389)]. The expression of an enlarged PolyQ contributes to the impairment of wild-type protein [ [68](#B68-brainsci-12-01389)]. Consequently, wild-type huntingtin loss or inactivation causes neurodegeneration. Different pathways involved in HD are illustrated below. 6.1. Transcriptional Dysregulation [69](#B69-brainsci-12-01389)]. Mutant htt impairs transcription, according studies [ [70](#B70-brainsci-12-01389), [71](#B71-brainsci-12-01389)]. This mutant htt interferes with transcription regulators such as p53, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein, all of which are significant for cellular functions and survival [ [72](#B72-brainsci-12-01389), [73](#B73-brainsci-12-01389), [74](#B74-brainsci-12-01389), [75](#B75-brainsci-12-01389), silencer elements (NRSE) mediated transcription in HD and in normal person are described below. 6.1.1. cAMP Response Element-Binding (CREB) Protein Pathway Normal Individual [Figure 1](#brainsci-12-01389-f001)A), the stimulation of certain transcription factors, such as CREB, which binds to DNA regions containing CRE in cellular promoters, is significant for neuronal survival [ [77](#B77-brainsci-12-01389)]. Transcriptional activation due to CREB [ [78](#B78-brainsci-12-01389)]. chromatin further, allowing the component of TFIID [ [79](#B79-brainsci-12-01389)]. Thus, the overall transcriptional machinery, including transcriptional factors TFIIA, B, D, E, F, and H, and TATA-binding protein (TBP), are activated. TFIIH phosphorylates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) to commence transcription once it is suitable [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [80](#B80-brainsci-12-01389), [81](#B81-brainsci-12-01389)]. HD Diseased Patient [Figure 1](#brainsci-12-01389-f001)B) with direct interaction or sequestration of CBP and TAFII130 in the nucleus. CBP and TAFII 130 eventually lose their capability to attach to CRE sites in cellular promoters. Because the general transcription machinery, as well as Pol II, is not adequately positioned to the promoter, transcriptional activation is hampered [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [82](#B82-brainsci-12-01389), [83](#B83-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.1.2. NRSE Pathway Normal Individual [Figure 2](#brainsci-12-01389-f002)A), the wild type htt regulates the action of the genes that contain (NRSE) by modifying cytoplasmic hiring to the nucleus of NRSE binding transcription factors, which are critical survival factors for striatal neurons [ [84](#B84-brainsci-12-01389)]. The transcription factor REST-NRSF (repressor-element-1 transcription factor-neuron restrictive silencer factor) attaches to NRSEs in neuronal gene promoters such as the BDNF gene [ [85](#B85-brainsci-12-01389)]. Wild type htt survives BDNF synthesis by networking with REST-NRSF in the cytoplasm, alleviating its capacity to attach to NRSE sites in the nucleus. Activators that attach to the BDNF promoter regions and afterward engage the transcription process and pol II boost BDNF transcription in these settings [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389), [86](#B86-brainsci-12-01389), [87](#B87-brainsci-12-01389)]. Diseased HD Patient [Figure 2](#brainsci-12-01389-f002)B). REST-NRSF attaches to the NRSE with vigor in these conditions, promoting the incorporation of Sin3A-histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) with histone Consequently, the expression of NRSE, NRSF, BDNF, are suppressed [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389)]. System 6.2.1. Chaperones and the Proteasome Dysfunction [91](#B91-brainsci-12-01389)]. Heat shock proteins play an important role in protein folding and quality control. In the context of polyglutamine diseases, such as HD, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70; Hspa1a/b), Hsp40 (Dnajb1), and Hsp90 (Hsp90aa1 and Hsp90ab1) have been the subject of several studies. Elevation of Hsp70 levels has been found to be neuroprotective in several animal models [ [92](#B92-brainsci-12-01389)]. For instance, Hsp70 overexpression suppressed neuropathology and improved motor function in a spinocerebellar ataxia mouse model. Pharmacological and genetic Furthermore, Hsp70 of polyglutamine proteins into amyloid-like fibrils [ [93](#B93-brainsci-12-01389)]. As a result, proteins must either be refolded into their proper configuration, or the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades them [ [94](#B94-brainsci-12-01389)]. Hsp70 (Heat-shock protein 70) and Hsp40 (Heat-shock protein 40) are two prominent types of molecular chaperones that help in the folding of polypeptides and hence prevent misfolded proteins development. Furthermore, in other polyQ proteins, the mutant htt has been shown to be linked with the Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperone families and also colocalize with aggregates [ [95](#B95-brainsci-12-01389)]. Chaperone sequestration into aggregates reduces the quantity of soluble chaperones in the cell, which helps to alleviate aberrant protein folding [ [96](#B96-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.2.2. Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Impairment [Figure 3](#brainsci-12-01389-f003)) are listed below [ [12](#B12-brainsci-12-01389)]. - (1) - Hsp70 and Hsp40, two molecular chaperones, cause newly produced htt to pleat into a native structure [ [97](#B97-brainsci-12-01389)]. The neuronal transport. On the other hand, this htt might be carried into the nucleus and aid in transcriptional control. - (2) - Chaperones aid in the identification of aberrant proteins, promoting refolding or Ub (ubiquitination) and 26S proteasome [ [98](#B98-brainsci-12-01389)]. Mutations produce conformational anomalies and improper folding of htt in HD patients, resulting in a buildup of misfolded htt in the cytoplasm if chaperones are not precise. - (3) - However, mutant htt is cleaved by proteases, resulting in the formation of amino-terminal components that form -sheet structures [ [99](#B99-brainsci-12-01389)]. - (4) - As a result, cleaved N-terminal fragments or mutant full-length htt cause toxicity, forming soluble monomers, oligomers, or massive insoluble aggregates. Mutant forms of htt in cytoplasm disrupt the UPS, allowing misfolded proteins to accumulate [ [100](#B100-brainsci-12-01389)]. - (5) - Vesicle transport and clathrin-mediated endocytosis are disrupted by these noxious proteins. Furthermore, mutant htt promotes pro-apoptotic proteins through mitochondrial malfunction, causing cellular noxiousness and other negative implications [ [101](#B101-brainsci-12-01389)]. - (6) - For defence, the cell gathers hazardous pieces into ubiquitinated cytoplasmic perinuclear aggregates [ [102](#B102-brainsci-12-01389)]. - (7) 6.2.3. Altered Synaptic Plasticity [104](#B104-brainsci-12-01389)]. Reduced transcription significant signaling neurotransmission disrupts neuronal homeostasis [ [105](#B105-brainsci-12-01389)]. This causes imperfection accompanied by their axons in the transmission of organelles and proteins. Pathogenic htt also prevents organelle transportation across the axon [ [106](#B106-brainsci-12-01389), [107](#B107-brainsci-12-01389)]. Htt accelerates trafficking by acting as a scaffold connecting microtubules, cargoes, and motor Huntingtin-associated protein1 (HAP1) mediates this interface, which tends be impaired in HD disease [ [110](#B110-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.2.4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction [111](#B111-brainsci-12-01389), [112](#B112-brainsci-12-01389), [113](#B113-brainsci-12-01389)]. Oxidative stress is responsible for the neurodegenerative procedure of HD. Since mitochondria are the primary communicator of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in neurons, oxidative stress is related to mitochondrial dysfunction in HD. With an enhancement in ROS or RNS (reactive nitrogen species) production, susceptible neurons in the patient's brain suffering from HD may be unable to handle it well. Increase in levels of ROS or RNS in membranes may boost an intracellular cascade of oxidative stress by triggering lipid peroxidation and oxidizing DNA and proteins [ [114](#B114-brainsci-12-01389), [115](#B115-brainsci-12-01389)]. A substantial rise of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, an oxidized DNA marker, and a higher surge of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation marker is perceived in the brain of HD. Oxidative stress also promotes mutant htt-dependent cell death by mimicking proteasomal malfunction and htt aggregation. Elevation of free radical outcomes in the impairment of mitochondrial function, metabolic dysfunction, impairment of energy kind of glia, protect neurons from excitotoxicity by providing support and allowing extracellular glutamate absorption. In the occurrence of HD disease, however, an N-terminal htt with 160Q is expressed exclusively in astrocytes [ [124](#B124-brainsci-12-01389)]. Consequently, HD astrocytes contribute to neurological symptoms as well as other problems, such as reduced chemokine CCL5 or BDNF discharge [ [125](#B125-brainsci-12-01389)]. [126](#B126-brainsci-12-01389)]. These cells have a phagocytic function and will release cytotoxic factors such as nitric oxide (NO), ROS, and quinolinic acid to confer toxicity to invading pathogens [ [126](#B126-brainsci-12-01389), [127](#B127-brainsci-12-01389)]. M2 microglia also carry out phagocytosis but contrary to the role of M1 microglia, M2 microglia exhibit an anti-inflammatory role [ [126](#B126-brainsci-12-01389)]. This is through the release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 13 (IL-13), IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) to suppress inflammatory responses [ [128](#B128-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.3.2. Release pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by htt expression in immune cells [ [129](#B129-brainsci-12-01389)]. Mutant htt affects inflammatory responses in the peripheral immune system by inhibiting NF-B signalling, implying that neuro-inflammation is both a reactive and proactive mechanism in disease development [ [130](#B130-brainsci-12-01389)]. IL-6 is upregulated in the plasma of HD patients [ [131](#B131-brainsci-12-01389)]. IL-6 stimulates the expression of another acute phase protein: -macroglobulin (M). M is upregulated in plasma of HD patients, mainly in reactive astrocytes, and therefore influences immune proteins and cytokines. Moreover, several mouse models of HD display significantly higher levels of IL-1. IL-1 itself is able to directly induce neurotoxicity via activation of tyrosine kinases and phosphorylation of NMDA receptors involving the NF-kappa() B pathway. Inflammatory responses are initiated by different receptors, among others, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR activation evokes NF-B activation resulting in increased transcription of proinflammatory cytokines [ [132](#B132-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.4. Axonal Transport Defect 6.4.1. Defective Transmission [41](#B41-brainsci-12-01389)]. HAP1 connects these receptors to the kinesin motor factor KIF5, and mutant htt disrupts this interface [ [133](#B133-brainsci-12-01389), [134](#B134-brainsci-12-01389)]. Mutant htt also prevents the release of BDNF and cortical transport and the regressive transport of its receptor TrkB in the striatum, which is essential to trigger survival signals in the cell body [ [86](#B86-brainsci-12-01389), [135](#B135-brainsci-12-01389)]. 6.4.2. Excitotoxicity and Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs) Degeneration [136](#B136-brainsci-12-01389)]. MSNs were also found to be selectively influenced by glutamatergic signals, which facilitate abnormal firing and neurotransmission, NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate activation, and can cause striatal neuronal via a process known as excitotoxicity [ [135](#B135-brainsci-12-01389), [137](#B137-brainsci-12-01389)]. Moreover, mutations in HD modify not only NMDAR trafficking in striatal neurons but also the balance of synaptic (pro-survival) 7. Diagnosis [142](#B142-brainsci-12-01389)]. The three main indications, also family history, are required for diagnosis. For all diagnostic tests, the patient must give informed consent [ [1](#B1-brainsci-12-01389)] ( [Figure 6](#brainsci-12-01389-f006)). In a patient with chorea, a diagnosis of HD is strongly suspected. The following is an alternative way of diagnosing HD: - (1) - (2) 8. Herbal Management of HD [39](#B39-brainsci-12-01389), [146](#B146-brainsci-12-01389), [147](#B147-brainsci-12-01389), [148](#B148-brainsci-12-01389)]. Several plants and phytochemicals that have been shown to have anti-HD properties are briefly described. 8.1. Panax Ginseng [149](#B149-brainsci-12-01389)]. Panax ginseng is derived from the Greek words \"pan\" meaning all and \"axos\" meaning cure [ [150](#B150-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is native to Korea and China but is now globally popular and cultivated in countries such as Japan, US, Russia, Canada, Vietnam, Nepal, and Eastern Himalayas [ [151](#B151-brainsci-12-01389), [152](#B152-brainsci-12-01389)]. [153](#B153-brainsci-12-01389), [154](#B154-brainsci-12-01389), [155](#B155-brainsci-12-01389)]. Ginseng has a beneficial effect on psychological feature performance owing to its action on the hippocampal brain [ [156](#B156-brainsci-12-01389)]. Inhibition of Ca2+ [157](#B157-brainsci-12-01389), The inhibition of both NMDA and glutamate-induced by saponins from ginseng increases Ca2+ entry through glutamate receptors [ [159](#B159-brainsci-12-01389)]. An in vitro HD assay with MSN cultures for the investigation of the neuroprotective potential of compounds of ginseng total saponins exhibits neuroprotection by Rb1, Rg5, and Rc are interlinked with the capacity to prevent glutamate induced Ca2+ responses. These results can be credited to the active therapeutic choice to treat HD [ [160](#B160-brainsci-12-01389)]. Ginsenosides Rd, Rb1, and Rb3 have also been shown to protect striatal neuronal damage caused by 3-NP [ [161](#B161-brainsci-12-01389)]. Active components of ginseng demonstrate to possess beneficial potential such as antioxidant [ [160](#B160-brainsci-12-01389)], anti-apoptotic [ [160](#B160-brainsci-12-01389)], anti-inflammatory [ [161](#B161-brainsci-12-01389)], [162](#B162-brainsci-12-01389)]. Moreover, lipid peroxidation and Ca2+ influx and suppresses neuronal excitotoxicity, stabilizes ATP levels in cells, protects neuronal structural integrity, and improves cognitive function [ [163](#B163-brainsci-12-01389), [164](#B164-brainsci-12-01389)]. 8.2. Bacopa monnieri [163](#B163-brainsci-12-01389), [165](#B165-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is also known as Brahmi and is found in warm wetlands [ [165](#B165-brainsci-12-01389)]. They are indigenous to India and Australia [ [166](#B166-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is also grown in Sri Lanka, Nepal, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, Florida, and other southern states of the USA [ [167](#B167-brainsci-12-01389)]. [165](#B165-brainsci-12-01389), [167](#B167-brainsci-12-01389), [168](#B168-brainsci-12-01389), [169](#B169-brainsci-12-01389)]. It also [170](#B170-brainsci-12-01389), [174](#B174-brainsci-12-01389), [175](#B175-brainsci-12-01389), [176](#B176-brainsci-12-01389)]. The existence of active constituents such as saponin, alkaloids, sterols, and flavonoids, are attributed to of B. monnieri [ [165](#B165-brainsci-12-01389), [177](#B177-brainsci-12-01389), [178](#B178-brainsci-12-01389)]. This plant has potential activity as a memory booster, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hepatoprotective, and antipyretic, free radical scavenging neuropharmacological disorders as insomnia and antidepressant agent [ [179](#B179-brainsci-12-01389), [180](#B180-brainsci-12-01389)]. Bacoside A is the chief constituent for improving memory [ [181](#B181-brainsci-12-01389), [182](#B182-brainsci-12-01389)]. Due to mechanisms including metal ions complex chelation and enhanced antioxidant defense enzymes enhance the neuroprotective and memory-boosting effects of B. monneiri extracts [ dehydrogenase electron transport chain complex II-III [ [186](#B186-brainsci-12-01389)]. It also reduces ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), and free fatty acid levels [ [187](#B187-brainsci-12-01389)]. The oral intake of BM's leaf powder is reported to reduce basal concentrations of several oxidative markers and improve thiol-related antioxidant molecules, and antioxidant enzyme activity [ [188](#B188-brainsci-12-01389)]. The dietary B. monneiri supplements lead to consequential defense against oxidative impairment in the brain along with a defensive effect against neuronal dysfunction due to stress. Thus, B. monneiri can be very beneficial in HD treatment [ [189](#B189-brainsci-12-01389)]. 8.3. Curcuma longa [190](#B190-brainsci-12-01389)] with yellow [190](#B190-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is also cultivated expansively in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines [ [192](#B192-brainsci-12-01389), [193](#B193-brainsci-12-01389)]. [194](#B194-brainsci-12-01389)], is a natural agent with several functions and is pharmacologically safe [ [195](#B195-brainsci-12-01389)]. Curcumin is a phytochemical and a crucial bioactive ingredient is stated antioxidant, antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antibacterial, and antiplatelet chemical structure [ [196](#B196-brainsci-12-01389)]. [197](#B197-brainsci-12-01389)]. Especially under a neurodegenerative condition such as HD, the accumulation of abnormal forms of particular proteins, such as htt, may have a role in disease development [ [198](#B198-brainsci-12-01389)]. A study showed improvement in HD-like neurodegeneration when treated with solid lipid nanoparticles of curcumin (C-SLNs) [ [199](#B199-brainsci-12-01389)]. There is also a considerable increase in mitochondrial complex activity and cytochrome levels. C-SLNs significantly reduced protein carbonyl production, lipid peroxidation, ROS levels, and mitochondrial swelling by restoring levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [ [200](#B200-brainsci-12-01389)]. Moreover, treatment with curcumin is reported to enhance cognitive and motor performances, restore succinate dehydrogenase action, and reduce oxidative stress, which inhibits the 3-NP in HD [ [201](#B201-brainsci-12-01389)]. Curcumin also rescues down-regulated molecular in HD, including Hsp70 [ [202](#B202-brainsci-12-01389)]. Curcumin therapy also restored [38](#B38-brainsci-12-01389), [205](#B205-brainsci-12-01389)]. Ginkgo is indigenous to Japan, China, Korea, North America, and Europe [ [150](#B150-brainsci-12-01389)]. G. biloba, alike most plant medicines, [205](#B205-brainsci-12-01389), found that Ginkgo biloba might repair some of the neurological problems caused by a toxin, 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) [ [208](#B208-brainsci-12-01389)]. When injected into the brains of mice, 3-NP mimics the effects of HD: it causes many of the biological and behavioral changes that are seen in people with HD. However, mice that were treated with both 3-NP and ginkgo biloba showed milder neurodegenerative problems than those treated with 3-NP alone. Several biochemical changes that occur upon exposure to 3-NP were mitigated in animals that were treated with Ginkgo biloba. Authors suggest that Ginkgo biloba's antioxidant properties, antiapoptotic effects, and improvement of energy metabolism were responsible for the neuroprotective effects. The G. biloba extract improves the 3-NP induced neurobehavioral impairments and xl the striatum are also down-regulated and up-regulated by standardized G. biloba extract (EGb 761). These biochemical findings, together with histological findings, suggested that EGb 761 can be utilized in HD [ [211](#B211-brainsci-12-01389)]. 8.5. Centella asiatica [212](#B212-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is classified as a Rasayana in Ayurveda because of its quality to heal memory and age-related brain problems [ [213](#B213-brainsci-12-01389), [214](#B214-brainsci-12-01389)]. It is a controlling brain tonic that has long been utilized in Ayurvedic medicine to revitalize the body, boost intelligence, and treat cognitive problems such as Alzheimer's disease [ [215](#B215-brainsci-12-01389), [216](#B216-brainsci-12-01389)]. [217](#B217-brainsci-12-01389), [218](#B218-brainsci-12-01389)]. Research revealed the activity of AA on the neurodegenerative potential of C. asiatica in CNS directing on brain cells enhances the elongation of neuritis in an in vitro experimental model [ [219](#B219-brainsci-12-01389), [220](#B220-brainsci-12-01389)]. An in vivo study on C. asiatica leaf extract also demonstrated healing in the dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA3 neurons [ [221](#B221-brainsci-12-01389), [222](#B222-brainsci-12-01389)]. a are MEK/ERK PI3/Atk signalling pathways [ [223](#B223-brainsci-12-01389), [224](#B224-brainsci-12-01389)]. Moreover, the neurodegenerative effect of C. asiatica takes place via the MAP kinase pathway [ [219](#B219-brainsci-12-01389), [223](#B223-brainsci-12-01389)]. The most significant use of C. asiatica is regarded as a brain tonic to enhance memory function [ [225](#B225-brainsci-12-01389)]. The ability to preserve mental function is attributed to its antioxidant characteristics. Various ROS scavenging experiments in vitro and in vivo have been established to discover this effect. C. asiatica improves faster functional recovery and enhanced axonal regeneration, according to a study [ [226](#B226-brainsci-12-01389)]. An alternative study found a considerable elevation in dendritic length and branching sites in amygdaloid and hippocampal CA3 neurons [ [227](#B227-brainsci-12-01389)]. As a result, the study's findings suggest that C. asiatica has a possible protective action against any assault (caused by oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage), and memory-enhancing properties can help control HD and its consequences. 8.6. Xylaria Species [228](#B228-brainsci-12-01389)]. Thus, figuring out how to prevent neuron mortality and increase the excitability of specific nerve cell connections could lead to new treatments. The identification of many unique, natural, and active chemicals often takes place in the marine environment [ [229](#B229-brainsci-12-01389)]. Xyloketal B has established robust neuroprotection in contrasting models related to neuronal impairments [ [230](#B230-brainsci-12-01389), [231](#B231-brainsci-12-01389)]. Six xyloketal B derivatives were evaluated in a Caenorhabditis elegans HD model to find potent neuroprotective for HD; all six compounds demonstrated a preventive role [ [232](#B232-brainsci-12-01389)]. The aromatic core structure of Xyloketal B features unique bicyclic acetal moieties that can be easily changed to ameliorate and broaden its activity [ [233](#B233-brainsci-12-01389), [234](#B234-brainsci-12-01389)]. Moreover, some xyloketal derivatives can form a hydrogen bond. Xyloketal adheres to mutant htt proteins and inhibits the htt aggregation process, hence slowing the progression of HD [ [235](#B235-brainsci-12-01389)]. Molecular docking experiments demonstrate that it can bind to the mutant htt protein's GLN369 and GLN393 residues, generating a stable trimeric complex that prevents mutant htt aggregation formation. Thus, xyloketal derivatives serve as novel drug candidates for treating HD [ [232](#B232-brainsci-12-01389)]. 9. Pain and HD [236](#B236-brainsci-12-01389), [237](#B237-brainsci-12-01389)]. Compared to other patients' symptoms, the pain might not seem like a major issue. Even still, it is misunderstood and poorly understood in HD, despite the fact that it might significantly improve the quality of life for those who are impacted. Numerous research has examined the root causes of chronic pain in HD patients. Muscle and endocrine dysfunction, which are putative sources of nociceptive and neuropathic pain in HD, may be exacerbated by mutant Huntingtin [ [238](#B238-brainsci-12-01389)], perhaps through inflammatory and immune mechanisms [ [239](#B239-brainsci-12-01389)]. A meta-analysis indicated that while the pain burden in HD was lower than that of the general population, the total mean prevalence of pain in HD was around 41% [ [240](#B240-brainsci-12-01389)]. A cross-sectional analysis of the Enroll-HD study in carriers of the pre-manifest and manifest HD gene mutations and in carriers of the non-HD gene mutation was performed, which verified that the prevalence of pain interference was considerably higher in the middle stage of HD compared to not HD gene carriers and that the late and middle stages of HD had lower prevalence's of painful situations [ [241](#B241-brainsci-12-01389)]. According to reports, persistent pain is less common in HD patients who are evident, and it tends to get less common as the disease progresses. Patients with HD also experienced less severe pain and associated dysfunction. Additionally, with the complete phenotypical presentation of the disease in the middle and late stages, this characteristic, which was lacking in the pre-manifest phase, became relevant. Patients with more CAG expansion and decreased functional capacity appeared to have diminished pain perception [ [242](#B242-brainsci-12-01389)]. 10. Discussion [243](#B243-brainsci-12-01389)]. Although HD is rare, it does receive a great deal of research attention. One reason is that HD has some features that make it more likely to be a tractable problem than other neurodegenerative conditions. First, the autosomal dominant nature of the condition means that the diagnosis is it is possible to accurately model and study the disease in vitro and in vivo. It is estimated that the mean HD prevalence is 5 in 100,000 people. Moreover, in another study, it is estimated that one in every 10,000 persons-nearly, 30,000 in the United States, have Huntington's disease. Juvenile Huntington's occurs in approximately 16% of all cases [ [244](#B244-brainsci-12-01389), [245](#B245-brainsci-12-01389)]. Somatic instability of the CAG repeat occurs in the tissues that are most vulnerable to HD pathology, particularly the striatum, and the degree of instability negatively correlates with age at disease onset. Genetic association studies have shown that DNA repair components, particularly those involved in mismatch repair, modify somatic instability and disease course [ [117](#B117-brainsci-12-01389)]. Mutation of Htt characterized with repeat expansion of CAG trinucleotides is the key factor in HD. Abnormal aggregation of mutant Htt protein may cause toxic effects in neurons, leading to a series of pathogenic mechanisms associated the alteration in proteostasis and protein degradation following mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, transcription and synaptic dysfunction, axonal transport impairment, and a series of metabolic impairments subsequent to neurodegeneration. Despite the fact that the pathogenesis of HD has still not been resolved and a cure is not available, many therapeutic options are available for treating symptoms and signs with a view to improving quality of life. Although many signs and symptoms can be treated, it is not always necessary to do so. To date, there are no promising treatments for the long-term unwanted effects of HD, which are being combated by symptomatic prevention and treatments for mitigating the psychiatric, cognitive, and motor deformities of HD. The patient's limitations in daily life determine whether or not drugs are required. Very little evidence is available about the drug or the dosage to prescribe for any signs and symptoms. To overcome the above-mentioned concerns, investigation has been devoted to the isolation of novel compounds from a variety of natural products in modulating relevant neuro-degenerative disorders. Up until then, a plethora of traditional treatments based on natural products have been shown to possess a wide range of therapeutic benefits for HD under in vitro and in vivo models [ [246](#B246-brainsci-12-01389), [247](#B247-brainsci-12-01389)]. The neuroprotective effect of natural products in HD experimental models has been extensively studied. Indeed, based on relevant studies, natural products offer neuroprotection in experimental models predominantly through the antioxidant defense system, scavenging free radicals, neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduction of oxidative stress, preservation of mitochondrial function, anti-inflammatory protection, inhibition of apoptosis, and induction of autophagy. 11.
