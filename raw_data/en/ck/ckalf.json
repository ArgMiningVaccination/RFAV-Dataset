SUMMARY Antibodies play major roles in immunity to malaria; however, a limited understanding of mechanismsmediating protection is a major barrier to vaccinedevelopment. We have demonstrated that acquired human anti-malarial antibodies promote comple- ment deposition on the merozoite to mediate inhibi-tion of erythrocyte invasion through C1q xationand of the classical complement pathway.Antibody-mediated complement-dependent (Ab-C 0) inhibition was the predominant invasion-inhibitoryactivity antibodies; most antibodies werenon-inhibitory without complement. Inhibitory activ- ity was mediated predominately via C1q xation, and merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were identi-ed as major targets. Complement xation by anti-bodies was very strongly associated with protectionfrom both clinical malaria and high-density parasite-mia in a prospective longitudinal study of children.Ab-C 0inhibitory activity could be induced by human immunization with a candidate merozoite surface- protein vaccine. Our ndings demonstrate that human anti-malarial antibodies have evolved to func-tion by xing complement for potent invasion-inhibi-tory activity and protective immunity. INTRODUCTION Humoral responses to Plasmodium falciparum are an important component of acquired immunity against malaria, as demon-strated in pivotal studies in which immunoglobulin G (IgG) from immune adults was transferred to malaria-infected children and resulted in parasite clearance and recovery ( Cohen et al.,1961 ). Antibodies are thought to protect by inhibiting blood- stage replication and preventing high-density parasitemia. How- ever, specic mechanisms of protection are not well understood. The merozoite stage, which infects red blood cells (RBCs), is animportant target, and antibodies to some merozoite antigens can inhibit P. falciparum replication in vitro et al., 2001; Miura et al., 2009; Reiling et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2011 ). However, antibodies targeting numerous merozoite antigens, including vaccine candidates such as MSP2 and MSP3, lack activity in these standard assays ( McCarthy et al., 2011; Oeuvray et al., 1994 ), despite some evidence of efcacy in clinical and pre- clinical trials ( Genton et al., 2002; Sirima et al., 2011 ). Indeed, growth-inhibitory activity of human antibodies is not consistentlypredictive of clinical immunity ( Crompton et al., 2010; Dent et al., 2008; Marsh et al., 1989; McCallum et al., 2008 ), and antibodies from immune adults often fail to inhibit parasite replication in standard assays ( Dent et al., 2008; McCallum et al., 2008; Shi et al., 1999 ). A lack of established immune correlates of protection severely hampers the evaluation and prioritization of vaccines ( Beeson et al., 2014 ). Overall reactivity of antibodies to merozoite antigens as measured by ELISA correlates with protection in some, but not all, human studies ( Fowkes et al., 2010 ). Human antibodies are predominantly cytophilic subclasses IgG1 and IgG3; these have been associated with protection from malaria ( Polley et al., 2006; Richards et al., 2010; Roussil- hon et al., 2007; Stanisic et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 1998 ). This rai- ses the question of whether complement might be an important effector of antibody function. Although complement activation has been reported in malaria infection and innate activationhas been implicated in pathogenesis (reviewed in Biryukov and Stoute, 2014 ), the role of complement in antibody-mediated pro- tection has not been dened. Here, we developed approaches and assays to determine the ability of acquired human antibodies to x complement and inhibit merozoite invasion of RBCs and to identify major mero-zoite targets of these antibodies. We evaluated antibody activity 580 Immunity 42, 580-590, March 17, 2015 \u00aa2015 The Authorsin naturally exposed individuals from diverse geographic regions and vaccinated humans, and we obtained epidemiologic evidence supporting a role for antibody-mediated complement xation in protective immunity to malaria in children. Our ndingsrepresent a major advance in understanding immunity to malaria and provide a much-needed strategy for the development and evaluation of vaccines. RESULTS Human IgG from Malaria-Exposed Donors Has Complement-Dependent Inhibitory Activity To assess the role of complement in antibody inhibition of inva-sion, we performed merozoite-invasion assays in the presence or absence of active complement Boyle et al., 2010b ;Figures S1A membrane ltration and incubated with uninfected RBCstogether IgG (1/200 to 1/10 dilution) from malaria-exposed pooled donors (from Kenya and Papua New Guinea [PNG]) in the presence of eithernormal serum heat-inactivated IgG from Kenyan donors was non-inhibitory in HIS but effectively inhibited invasionwhen incubated with NS ( Figure 1 A). IgG from PNG donors had some activity in HIS, but inhibition was much greater in NS (Figure 1 A). IgG from malaria-naive donors (Australian residents) was not inhibitory in NS or HIS, and the fact that NS did not inhibit in the absence of IgG indicates that complement alone is non-inhibitory ( Figures S1 C and S1D). The greater inhibition merozoite invasion by malaria-exposed IgG in NS than inHIS suggests that IgG interacts with complement to inhibit invasion. This identies an invasion-inhibitory mechanism that we refer to as antibody-mediated complement-dependent(Ab-C 0) inhibition. We will refer to inhibitory activity of antibodies in the absence of complement (HIS) as direct antibody inhibition. Complement xation on merozoites incubated with malaria- exposed IgG (PNG residents) malaria-naive (Australian residents) was investigated via immunoblot. C1q and C3b were detected at higher levels on incubated withNS and PNG IgG than on merozoites incubated with AustralianIgG, reflecting activation of the classical complement cascade by anti-merozoite antibodies ( Figure 1 B;Figures S1 E and S1F). Some C3b deposition was detected on merozoitesincubated with Australian IgG and NS, suggesting activation of the antibody-independent alternate pathway. C3b deposition was conrmed by immuno-electron C3b was detected after incubation with PNG IgG and NS, but not with HIS ( Figure 1 C;Figure S1 G). The for- mation of the membrane attack complex (MAC; componentsC5-C9) was detected by immuno-fluorescence (IF) microscopy. MAC formation was detected on merozoites incubated with PNG IgG and NS. Lower MAC formation was seen with Austra-lian IgG and NS ( Figure 1 D). Using an ELISA-based assay, we quantied MAC deposition and demonstrated that it was sig- nicantly higher (p < 0.01) with PNG IgG than with Australian (Melbourne) IgG ( Figure 1 E). These data show that human anti-malarial antibodies enhance complement deposition on merozoites via C1q xation and thus result in increased C3b deposition and MAC formation.C1q Fixation Mediates Ab-C 0Inhibition To test the importance of the activation of the classical comple- ment cascade in relation to that of the alternative complement cascade, we compared the invasion-inhibitory activity of anti-malarial antibodies between NS and HIS heated at 50 /C14C for 20 min; this treatment inhibits the alternative complement cascade by inactivating Factor B but leaves the classical com-plement cascade intact. The 50 /C14C treatment of serum had no signicant effect on the invasion-enhancing activity; invasion inhibition by PNG IgG was greater in the presence of NS and 50/C14C-treated serum than in the presence of standard HIS ( Fig- ure S2 A). This indicates that amplication of the alternative pathway does not account for Ab-C0inhibition. To address the relative importance of different complement components, wetested invasion inhibition in C1q- and C5-depleted serum and sion inhibition by IgG to assays with C1q-depleted serum, whichwas comparable to the greater inhibition in NS than in HIS ( Fig- ure 2 A). In contrast, there was signicantly less of a difference in the extent of PNG IgG inhibition in C5-reconstituted serumthan in C5-depleted serum. This suggests that activation of the classical complement cascade, specically xation of C1-C4, might be sufcient to mediate the majority of Ab-C 0and that deposition of C5-C9 is of less importance. To investigate this further, we incubated merozoites with PNG or Australian IgG in increasing concentrations of puried human C1q in the absenceof other complement factors. C1q substantially enhanced the inhibitory activity of PNG IgG ( Figure 2 B), indicating that C1q x- ation alone was sufcient to mediate substantial Ab-C 0inhibition. No inhibition was seen in the presence of control IgG or C1q. To investigate whether MAC deposition and lysis could also contribute to inhibiting invasion, we assessed the ability of IgG and complement to lyse merozoites. Merozoite invasion occursrapidly, such that 80% of invasion occurs within 10 min of mixing with RBCs ( Boyle et al., 2010b ); therefore, we assessed the lysis of merozoites within this time period. Merozoites were incubatedwith PNG or Australian IgG and 20% NS or HIS and counted by flow cytometry ( Figure 2 C;Figure S2 B). PNG IgG mediated a signicantly greater reduction in merozoites in NS than in HIS,whereas there was little lysis of merozoites with Melbourne IgG.Over an extended time period (30-60 min), lysis of merozoites was observed in NS alone ( Figure S2 C), consistent with the low rate of MAC formation in the absence of malaria-specic IgG(Figure 1 E). Rapid merozoite lysis was dependent on activation of the classical complement cascade and was not an artifact of agglutination, as conrmed by the lack of lysis in C1q-depletedserum ( Figure S2 D). Using PNG IgG and 20% NS, analysis of the timing of merozoite lysis revealed that lysis occurred rapidly, such that the majority occurred within 2-3 min of incubation andreached a maximum by 4 min ( Figure 2 D). Ab-C 0Inhibition Is the Predominant Mechanism Targeting Merozoite Invasion The importance of Ab-C0inhibition in naturally acquired immunity was assessed with puried IgG from Kenyan (n = 33) and PNG(n = 10) individuals. Overall, there was much greater Ab-C 0 inhibition than direct inhibitory activity ( Figure 3 A). Compared to direct inhibition, Ab-C0inhibitory activity was seen in a Immunity 42, 580-590, March 17, 2015 \u00aa2015 The Authors 581much greater proportion of individuals (proportion p < 0.01). These strikingresults reveal that the majority of human antibodies requirecomplement factors to effectively inhibit merozoite invasion. The extent of inhibitory activity varied widely. In Kenyan indi- viduals, four activity proles were observed: (1) no inhibitoryactivity in NS or HIS (11/33 [33%]); (2) invasion enhancement in HIS, but not NS (7/33 [21%]); (3) Ab-C 0inhibition only, demonstrated by invasion inhibition in NS, but not HIS (10/33[30%]); and (4) a combination of Ab-C0inhibition and direct inhibitory activity, demonstrated by inhibition in HIS and increased inhibition in NS (5/33 [15%]) ( Figure 3 B;Figure S3 A). Among PNG individuals, 50% had Ab-C0inhibitory activity only, and the remaining samples had substantial direct inhibitory activity ( Figure 3 C). Overall, 37% of samples had only com- plement-dependent inhibitory antibodies. In those with bothcomplement-dependent and directly active antibodies, com- plement-dependent inhibition ranged from 12% to 81% of the response. Aust IgG + N S Aust IgG + PNG min 1.

The prevalence of antibodies to merozoites was high, and merozoite-specic IgG was strongly and signicantly correlated with Ab-C 0inhibition, but not with direct inhibitory activity and less strongly with activity in GIAs (Table 1 ). Of note, the strongest correlation was between Ab-C0inhibition and IgG3 ( Figure 3 D). This relationship was stronger than that seen for IgG1 and is consistent with the knownproperty of IgG3 as the most potent activator of complement. Ab-C 0inhibition was also strongly correlated with age (Spear- man's r = 0.63, p = 0.0003), matching the acquisition of immu-nity. In contrast, direct inhibitory activity only weakly correlated with age (Spearman's r = 0.17, p = 0.38). With a median invasion in NS of 32.3% (95% CI = 54.7-82.2), Ab-C 0activity was alsogreater in GIAs, whose median growth was 89.3% (95% CI = 81-91, p = 0.007). Further, the proportion of individ- uals with positive Ab-C0inhibition increased with age, and 100% of adults had Ab-C0inhibitory activity; only 44% had direct activity ( Figure 3 E). These results strongly suggest that Ab-C0is the predominant mechanism of antibodies targeting merozoite invasion and is acquired in naturally exposed individuals as im-munity to malaria develops.C1q Fixation by Antibodies Correlates with Ab-C 0 InhibitionHaving shown that Ab-C 0inhibition functions via xation of C1q and the activation of the classical complement cascade, we evaluated the relationship between C1q deposition and Ab-C0 inhibition. We measured antibody-mediated C1q deposition using IgG from nine Kenyan individ- uals with high, medium, or low Ab-C0inhibition (n = 3 for each group). C1q deposition was notably higher with IgG from individ-uals who had high Ab-C 0inhibitory activity than with IgG from those with medium or low activity ( Figure 3 F). Next, to quantify C1q xation on merozoites, we developed a high-throughput plate-based assay that uses small sample volumes to allowtesting of large numbers of serum samples and that can be used with small-volume pediatric samples ( Figure S3 B). Anti- stronglycorrelated with 3 G). Samples that C1q xation also had high C3b xation ( Figure S3 C). This supports the important role of C1q xation and activation ofthe classical cascade in Ab-C 0inhibition and establishes an efcient complement-deposition assay that is suitable for appli- cation to clinical studies.Antibodies that Fix Complement Are Associatedwith Protection from Malaria To obtain epidemiologic evidence of the importance of anti- body-mediated complement xation in acquired immunity tomalaria, we tested antibodies for C1q xation from a longitudi- nal cohort of 206 5- to 14-year-old children who were resident in a malaria-endemic region of PNG ( Michon et al., 2007 ); all children were treated for malaria parasitemia at enrollment and then monitored by active surveillance for parasitemia and clinical malaria over 6 months of follow-up. The preva-lence of antibody-mediated C1q xation very high ( Table S1 ), reflective of substantial exposure to malaria in this population. Antibody-mediated C1q deposition was associated with age, such that olderchildren had signicantly higher C1q deposition than younger children ( Figure 4 A;Figure S4 ). C1q deposition was also higher in children who were parasitemic at the time of samplecollection than in aparasitemic children ( Figure 4 B). The in- crease in antibody-dependent C1q deposition with age and parasitemia is consistent with the expected acquisition ofimmunity. To assess the role of antibody-mediated C1q xation in pro- tection from symptomatic malaria and high-density parasitemia,we grouped children into low, medium, and high categories ofC1q-xation activity; we then compared the relative risk of malaria between response groups. High C1q deposition was very strongly associated with protection from clinical malaria(Table 2 ). The association between antibodies and protection from malaria appeared to have a dose-response relationship0255075100125Merozoite concentration (% of Australian IgG with HIS)NSHIS PNG Aust IgG source0 5 10 15 25 30 350255075100125150Invasion (% of PBS) C1q (g/ml)PNGAust 012340255075100125 Time (minutes) L ysis(% ofm a Figure 2.

Numerous variables wereexplored as possible confounding factors; only subject age and location of residence were signicantly associated with risk of malaria ( Michon et al., 2007 ). The strong protective asso- ciation for antibody-mediated C1q deposition remained after adjustment for age and location of residence (p < 0.0001), and protective associations were observed for children who wereparasitemic or aparasitemic at enrollment ( Figure S4 B). High C1q deposition was also strongly associated with protectionfrom episodes of high-density parasitemia (>5,000 parasites/ ml), which remained signicant after adjustment for confounders (Table 2 ;Figure 4 D). These data are consistent with a role for antibody-mediated complement xation and Ab-C 0inhibition in limiting blood-stage replication of P. falciparum and preventing disease.

Activity was specic, and no inhibition was seen with antibodiesfrom non-immunized rabbits (data not shown). Antibodies to the MAD20-like MSP1 block 2 alleles used in the parasite line tested (MAD20 and Wellcome alleles) inhibited invasion, whereas anti-bodies to heterologous K1-like (3D7 or Palo Alto) alleles did not, reflecting the strain specicity of the antibodies. It is notable that some antibodies to MSP2 and MSP1 block 2 enhancedinvasion in HIS, as was seen with some antibodies from naturally exposed subjects ( Figure 3 ), whereas they were inhibitory in the presence of NS. With rabbit antibodies to MSP3, MSP4,and AMA1, we observed minimal differences in invasion-inhibi-tory activity between NS and HIS. MSP2 and MSP3 are vaccine candidates that have pro- gressed to clinical trials, but development has been hamperedby the lack of immunologic correlates of protection, given that these antibodies are relatively non-inhibitory in standard GIAs (McCarthy et al., 2011; Oeuvray et al., 1994 ). The function of human antibodies to MSP2 and MSP3 was dened tion assays ( Figure 5 B). In agreement with results from rabbit antibodies, puried human anti-MSP2 antibodies signicantly inhibited invasion in NS, but not in HIS. In contrast, MSP3 anti- bodies showed a limited amount of direct inhibitory activityand no enhancement by complement. To further conrm the role of complement xation in mediating invasion inhibition and the signicance of MSP2 as a target, we tested a human MSP2-specic monoclonal antibody (mAb)with and without a specic change (L234A or L235A [LALA]) in the amino acid sequence of the Fc region ( Stubbs et al., 2011 ); this change ablates binding to C1q and complement activationbut leaves binding to the antigen unaffected ( Hessell et al., 2007 ). Signicantly greater invasion inhibition in NS than in HIS was only seen with wild-type MSP2 mAb and not with the modi- ed mAb. Further, invasion inhibition was greater in NS with thewild-type than in NS with the altered mAb. These results further conrm the importance of C1q xation in Ab-C 0inhibition and MSP2 as a target. Ab-C0Inhibitory Antibodies Can Be Induced by Human Immunization We examined whether Ab-C0inhibitory activity could be induced by immunization of malaria-naive individuals with recombinantmerozoite surface proteins. We studied samples from the recent phase 1 clinical trial of the MSP2-C1 vaccine ( McCarthy et al., 2011 ). IgG from ten individuals with high C1q-xation activity (as dened by ELISA) were tested for invasion-inhibitory activity in NS and HIS ( Figures 5 D and 5E). IgG from these individuals lacked inhibitory activity in standard GIAs despite high antibodyreactivity by ELISA ( McCarthy et al., 2011 ). Notably, eight of ten individual IgG samples showed substantial inhibition in NS, but not in HIS, indicating the induction of Ab-C 0inhibition by vaccination. No inhibition was seen pre-vaccinatedindividuals or placebo-vaccinated samples ( Figure S5 ). These data indicates that MSP2 antibodies induced by vaccination are able to inhibit invasion via Ab-C 0inhibition and identify a po- tential mechanism mediating the protective efcacy of MSP2- based vaccines ( Genton et al., 2002 ). DISCUSSION Although the importance of antibody in immunity to malaria has been established ( Cohen et al., 1961 ), mechanisms mediating protection are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidencethat complement plays a key role in antibody-mediated immunity to malaria in humans. Antibodies from malaria-exposed individ- uals enhanced complement xation on merozoites and had sub-stantially greater invasion-inhibitory activity in the presence of complement. Ab-C 0inhibition was the predominant mechanism inhibiting invasion, and many antibodies were only inhibitoryin the presence of complement factors. Our ndings indicatethat the mechanism underlying this activity is predominately mediated by C1q xation. Antibody-complement interactions also led to merozoite lysis. the most abundant antigens, MSP1 and MSP2. Furthermore, we provide epidemiologic evidence of the role of antibody-complement interactions in human immunity bydemonstrating that C1q xation was very strongly associated with protection from clinical malaria and high-density parasite- mia in a prospective longitudinal study of children. Finally, wedemonstrated that Ab-C 0inhibition can be induced by human immunization, providing an important proof of concept for trans- lation into malaria vaccine development. Comparisons of Ab-C0inhibitory activity in serum depleted and reconstituted with C1q or C5 highlight the importance of C1q in mediating inhibition of invasion. Further, C1q alone was able to signicantly enhance the inhibitory activity of anti-malarial antibodies in the absence of other complement factors. This was further demonstrated by comparison of wild-type and altered human MSP2 mAbs; Ab-C 0inhibition 1.

C1q-mediated anti- body neutralization has been previously reported with influenza (Feng et al., 2002 ) and West Nile virus ( Mehlhop et al., 2009 ). Enhanced inhibition by C1q might be due to increased steric hin-drance by the large (460-kDa) C1q-IgG complex blocking bind-ing of parasite proteins to cellular receptors or through the stabi- lization of IgG of low avidity. In complement-free to MSP1 ( Blackman MSP2 ( Boyle et al., 2014 ) can be internalized into the RBC while bound to the merozoite surface without inhibiting invasion. However, in the presence of complement,antibodies to MSP2 and MSP1 effectively inhibit invasion. The C1q-IgG complex might be too large to be internalized during invasion, thereby mediating the inhibitory activity of antibodiesthat are otherwise not directly inhibitory. Although C1q-mediated enhancement appears central to in- vasion-inhibitory activity, complement deposition and lysis ofmerozoites are likely to have other implications in vivo, includingenhancement of phagocytosis and induction of pro-inflamma- tory cytokines that might further mediate control of parasitemia. Complement activation, particularly as part of the innate immuneresponse, has been implicated in pathogenesis as a result of induction of inflammatory responses (reviewed in Biryukov andStoute, 2014; Silver et al., 2010 ). In the absence of anti-malarial antibodies, complement did not inhibit merozoite invasion, despite some deposition of C3b and MAC on the parasite surface and the eventual lysis of merozoites in the absence ofmalaria-exposed IgG with extended incubations. This is mostlikely due to the reduced rate and extent of complement deposi- tion in the absence of specic antibody and might also indicate that merozoites could be able to inhibit complement activation,as described for other pathogens ( Lambris et al., 2008 ). Testing antibodies from various individuals demonstrated that Ab-C 0inhibition was the predominant mechanism for inhibition of invasion; the extent of inhibition and the prevalence of Ab-C0 inhibition were greater than direct antibody inhibition, andAb-C 0inhibition increased with age, reflective of the known acquisition of immunity. Strong epidemiologic evidence of the importance of complement xation in antibody-mediated immunity to malaria was established in a longitudinal cohort ofchildren acquiring immunity. High-C1q-xing antibodies werevery strongly associated with protection from clinical malaria. Furthermore, complement xation was strongly associated with protection from high-density parasitemia, consistent withthe proposed role of Ab-C 0inhibition in limiting parasite replica- tion and thereby preventing disease. These ndings provide Table 2.

Unadjusted hazard ratios (uHRs) and HRs adjusted for age and location of residence (aHRs) were calculated to compare low-versus-medium (LvM) or low-versus-high (LvH) groups for the risk of symptomatic malaria or high-density parasitemia (>5,000 parasites/ ml) over the time period of 6 months.

The GIA is performed in comple- ment-free conditions and is currently the only widely used func-tional assay of antibodies to merozoites ( Crompton et al., 2010; Dent et al., 2008; John et al., 2004; Marsh et al., 1989; McCallum et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2011 ). We propose that the weak and inconsistent correlation between standard GIAs and malaria im- munity reflects the central importance of complement factors in mediating antibody activity. Further, Ab-C 0inhibition strongly correlated with cytophilic antibodies to particularly IgG3. This ts with the properties of IgG3 as the most potent activator of complement and is consistent with nd-ings that ELISA titers of IgG3 to merozoite antigens are associ-ated with protection human cohort studies Courtin et al., 2009; Ndungu et al., al., 2010; 2007; proteins MSP1 were identied as important targets of Ab-C 0inhibition. Antibodies to MSP1 block 2 and MSP2 show inhibition in standard GIAs ( Boyle et 2009; al., 2009; Mc- Carthy et al., 2011 ). The block 2 region of MSP1 is polymorphic and under balancing selection, suggesting immune pressure.Consistent with this, the Ab-C 0inhibitory activity of MSP1 block 2 antibodies was strain specic, supporting the view that poly- morphisms have evolved to mediate immune evasion. Our studies have established a proof of principle that Ab-C0 inhibitory antibodies can be induced by human vaccination with recombinant merozoite surface antigens with the use of samples from a phase 1 trial of the MSP2-C1 vaccine.A vaccine based on MSP2 was previously found to have sig- nicant protective efcacy against P. falciparum parasitemia in a naturally exposed population in PNG ( Genton et al., 2002 ).However, the mechanism of protective function of MSP2 anti- bodies has been unclear ( McCarthy et al., 2011 ). Here, we have shown that antibodies to MSP2 interact with complement to inhibit invasion. The identication of Ab-C 0activity as a central protective mechanism of antibodies targeting merozoite antigensmight suggest a role for this assay in evaluating candidate vac- cines. Unlike the phase 2 vaccine trial of MSP2, a phase 2 trial of a MSP1 42-kDa C-terminal construct (MSP1-42) had no ef-cacy in a naturally exposed population in Kenya ( Ogutu et al., 2009 ). Vaccine failure might be explained by antigenic diversity, given that only a single allele of the polymorphic MSP1-42 antigenwas included, or by epitope specicity, or concentra- tion of antibodies induced; the vaccine might have failed to induce strong complement-xing antibodies to effectively inhibit inva-sion, which could be investigated in future studies. In conclusion, we have identied Ab-C 0inhibition as a promi- nent mechanism targeting the merozoite in naturally acquired immunity, and we found that complement-dependent inhibitioncan be mediated by antibodies induced by human immunization with a recombinant merozoite surface-protein vaccine. Our nd- ings demonstrate that human anti-malarial antibodies haveevolved to function in the presence of complement by recruiting complement for functional activity and protective immunity. These insights mark a major change in our understanding ofmechanisms of functional immunity and provide tools for evalu- ating naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. Our ndings might have translational implications, indicating thatfocusing on targets and strategies that induce strong comple-ment-xing antibodies might be an important step in the devel- opment of highly efcacious vaccines.

Recombinant MSP2 mAb was expressed with the wild-type sequence or with a LALA Fc mutation, which is known toablate C1q xation. Two IgG frommalaria-naive adults immunized with recombinantMSP2 antigen was tested in the presence of 50% NS or HIS at a 1/2 dilution of the original concentration. Data represent the mean \u00b1 range from two independent assays performed in duplicate.(E) Overall, inhibitory activity by IgG from individuals receiving the MSP2 vaccine was greater when it was tested in the presence of 50% NS than when it was tested in the presence of HIS.See also Figure S5 . Immunity 42, 580-590, March 17, 2015 \u00aa2015 The Authors 587Parasite Culture, Synchronization, and Invasion-Inhibition Assays The P. falciparum D10-GFP expression line was cultured as previously described and synchronized with heparin ( Boyle et al., 2010a; Wilson et al., 2010 ). Invasion-inhibition assays were performed as described in Boyle et al. (2010a) ; merozoites were incubated with uninfected RBCs, normal or heat-inactivated serum (NS or HIS, respectively), and test IgG for 30 min ( Fig- ure S1 A). Cells were washed and cultured for 40 hr and then analyzed via flow cytometry. NS and HIS was from malaria-naive donors. For heat inactivation,sera were heated at 56 /C14C for 30 min. For assays testing the importance of the alternative pathway, sera were heat inactivated at 50/C14C for 20 min. For assays testing the importance of C1q and C5 for Ab-C0activity, human serum depleted 25% concentration. GIAs were performed as described inPersson et al. (2006) . Human Subjects and Samples Ethical approval for the use of human serum and plasma samples in thesestudies was obtained from the Alfred Human Research and Ethics Committeefor the Burnet Institute, from the Kenya Medical Research Institute, from theMedical Research Advisory Committee of Papua New Guinea, and from theHuman Research and Ethics Committee of the Queensland Institute of MedicalResearch. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or,in the case of children, from their parents or guardians. Serum pools from ma-laria-exposed donors were made from serum samples from Kenya (Ngerenya,Kili District) and PNG (Madang District). Unexposed serum pools were fromAustralian donors residing in Melbourne (Australia Red Cross Blood Bank).IgG from serum pools was puried with Melon Gel according to the manufac-turer's (Thermo Scientic) instructions. Puried IgG was concentrated (molecular weight cutoff) spin-purication tubes (Amicon) andbuffer exchanged with PBS. For the longitudinal study of PNG children, plasmasamples were obtained at enrollment from a prospective treatment-reinfectioncohort of 206 children aged 5-14 years (median = 9.3) in Madang, PNG ( Mi- chon et al., 2007 ). Children were actively reviewed every 2 weeks for symptom- atic illness and parasitemia, and by passive case detection, over a period of6 months. A clinical episode of P. falciparum malaria was dened as fever and P. falciparum parasitemia >5,000 parasites/ ml. Serum samples were used from a phase 1 MSP2-C1 vaccine trial in which participants were immu-nized with both and FC27 MSP2 isoforms ISA720 ( McCarthy et al., 2011 ) (sponsored by PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative; Trial Registration, AWZCTR 12607000552482). Rabbit and Human Antibodies to Specic Merozoite Antigens Rabbit sera were raised against recombinant as described in Boyle et al. (2014) and Drew et al. (2012) . Human antibodies to MSP2 (FC27) and MSP3 (K1) were puried from PNG and donors via column chromatography according toestablished methods ( Reiling et al., 2012 ). A human mAb to MSP2 was previously isolated from a malaria-exposed donor and expressed as recombi-nant IgG1 with the wild-type sequence or with a Fc-LALA mutation ( Stubbs et al., 2011 ). Complement Deposition via Immunoblot, ELISA, and MicroscopyMerozoites were incubated with 25% NS and test IgG or serum samples for 1,5, 10, 15, or 30 min at 37 /C14C. Merozoites were washed and solubilized for immunoblot analysis. were anti-C3 (HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal, MP respectively. For ELISA, plates were coated with puried merozoites at 5 3106merozo- ites/well. Plates were blocked and then incubated with sera samples (1/250),and then recombinant C1q (10 mg/ml) and C1q detected goat anti- C1q antibodies and C3 deposition was also detectedwith C5-depleted serum as a complement source. For ELISA analysis of MACdeposition, isolated merozoites were incubated with 25% NS serum and IgGfrom PNG or Australian (Melbourne) serum pools for 10 min at 37 /C14C and then washed and coated into Nunc 96-well plates. Plates were blocked, andthe presence of MAC was detected with anti-C5-C9 antibodies (rabbit) lowed by anti-rabbit-HRP. For immuno-electron microscopy, were incubated with NS or HIS with PNG IgG for 10 min. Merozoites were washed and xed in 1% glutar-aldehyde and then processed and imaged as described in Boyle et al. (2010a) . with 25% NS serum and IgGfrom PNG or Melbourne donors for 10 min (37 /C14C). Merozoites were washed and dried on slides, xed with methanol, and blocked, and then MAC wasdetected with anti-C5-C9 antibodies (rabbit) and anti-rabbit-Alexa 488 anti-bodies. Images were obtained as described in Reiling et al. (2012) . Assays of Merozoite NS, C1q-depleted serum for 10 min (37 /C14C); for assays to assess the rate of merozoite lysis, an aliquot of sample was taken every minute for analysisby flow cytometry. Samples were diluted 1/100 in 200 ml cold PBS and 1% newborn calf serum, and the density of merozoites was counted with Count- Bright counting beads via flow cytometry. ELISA to Intact Merozoites ELISAs were performed according to standard methods ( Stanisic et al., 2009 ). Puried merozoites were coated in PBS and placed on microtiter plates.Merozoites were blocked and subsequently incubated with Kenya serum diluted at 1/250 and then sheep anti-human IgG diluted at 1/2,500. Data Analysis Differences in invasion-inhibitory IgG activity between NS and HIS and be-tween C1q-depleted and -reconstituted serum were calculated with pairedt tests in Stata/SE 11.2. Associations between antibody reactivity to intactmerozoites by ELISA and functional activity in assays of Ab-C 0inhibition, direct inhibition, and growth inhibition were assessed with Spearman's correlations calculated in Prism. Analysis of the cohort study was performed with Stata/SE 12.0. Differences in C1q deposition between groups were assessed by chi-square tests (for cat-egorical variables) or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (for continuous variables). Forassessment of associations between C1q deposition and protection, subjectswere stratied into tertiles according to low (including those classied as''negative''), medium, or high deposition of C1q, as determined by optical-den-sity values for each sample. Groups were compared for risk of clinical malaria(fever and >5,000 parasites/ ml) or high-density proportional-hazards model Reiling et al., 2010; Richards et al., 2010 ). Survival analysis included rst episodes only. Age and location of residence were previously identied as potential confounders from a rangeof factors ( Stanisic et al., 2009 ).
