My interest in preventive medicine makes the headache field even more rewarding. I have been having migraine headaches with and without aura since medical school, but I was able to keep my headaches very infrequent and well-responsive to acute treatment. My secret is a healthy lifestyle and a Mediterranean diet. I can help thousands of patients, not only using the knowledge of headache medicine but also by helping them with a preventive approach. As a child neurologist, I always prefer minimal interventions with minimal side effects if possible. I have a chance to diagnose lifetime conditions at very early age, not only for migraine, but also for several other neurologic conditions including epilepsy, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Preventive medicine has a lot to offer to recognize and predict conditions earlier and manage better.
