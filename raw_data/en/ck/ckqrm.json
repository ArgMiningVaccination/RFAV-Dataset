From: Pierron E. Tackes To: State Meat Inspection Date: Friday, October 7, 2022 7:24:40 AM Autumn, I have copied Teresa and Cody here for some input from EHS. I did a little digging and found that NRS Chapter 583 was updated in 2015 and removed all references to the Board of Health in statute. However, the corresponding regulations, whichpredate the change in 2015, reference regulations developed by the Board of Health. Interestingly, NAC 583.520 also references a cooperative agreement between DHHS and Deptof Ag. Teresa, do you have any knowledge of that agreement? NAC583.520 Adoption of federal regulations. (NRS 583.535) The cooperative agreement between the Health Division of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Consumer and Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture contemplates that thestatus of slaughter and processing plants in Nevada will be equal to those required at plantsunder federal inspection. To accomplish this, the Board of Health hereby adopts as regulationsthe applicable sections of Part 302 to Part 320, inclusive, of the Regulations Governing MeatInspection of the Department of Agriculture. [Bd. of Health, Meat Inspection Reg. Art. VI, eff. 11-4-70] Ultimately, I think it will be important to relay to Shayda that AB 77 (2015) removed any statutory authority of the BOH to pass regulations under NRS Chapter 583 and gave thatauthority to the Department of Agriculture. BOH does retain general authority to passregulations relating to public health per NRS 439.200, as well as regulations over foodestablishments per NRS Chapter 446, and then lastly the Division has authority over the Food,Drugs and Comestics Act per NRS Chapter 585.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Board of Health: I'm wondering if you can help me...I had a nerve test done by Dr. Morton Hysom in Las Vegas. He was instructed to send it to my referring doctor, Dr. William Katschke, at LincolnCounty Medical Associates. When I went to my follow up appointment with Dr. Katschke,he indicated that he hadn't received the results of the test. By this time, I had receivednotice that Dr. Hysom had retired. I hadn't acted on this information because I wasunaware that the test results hadn't been sent. That leads to my question to you. Is there a records repository in your department towhich a retired physician submits their patient records for storage? Or, maybe they have tosubmit information to you in regards to the record storage elsewhere? I'm hoping that youcan give me a lead on where to go to get the test results. Any assistance you can providewould be greatly appreciated.

According to Walensky, \"There's NO bad ti me to get a COVID vaccine\" Meanwhile, Pfizer's data show the risk of miscarriage could be as high as 87.5% Safety for nursing mothers was not evaluated in the initial clinical trials, and subsequent investigations have been scar ce. In mid-July 2021, a small study found no trace of mRNA vaccine in breastmilk, but a September 2022 study did find mRNA in breastmilk for up to 48 hours post-jab These studies did not analyze the breastmilk fo r the presence of spike protein. Even if the mRNA is only transferable during the fi rst 48 hours post-jab, that does not mean it's safe to breastfeed thereaf ter. The breastmilk could potentially also transfer spike protein produced by the mother's body, a nd that production, we know, can continue for at least four months, and likely longer Walensky also continues to claim the COVID shots have no adverse effects on fertility, even though birth rates have plummete d since the rollout of the shots, raising alarm across the world.

No outcome was provided for 238 of those wo men, which leaves 32 pregnancies for which the outcome was reported. Howeve r, even for those 32, outcomes were only specified for 29: 26 ended in some form of miscarriage, two were premature births with neonatal death (meaning the babies died shortly after bei ng born early), and one birth was normal. Kory points out that the report is nebulous and unclear about the other three pregnancy outcomes, but were we to count those as live births, we're looking at 28 deaths out of 32 pregnancies, which means 87.5% of pregnant women (for whom they had data) lost their babies. For the record, the failure to record and repor t the outcomes of 238 out of 274 pregnancies during a drug trial is simply unheard of. It's shockingly unethical and criminally fraudulent. And the fact that both the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC accepted this, and claim there's \"no evidence\" of harm to pregnant women and their babies is proof positive of reprehensible malfeasance. 2021 \u2014 'No mRNA Found in Breastmilk' I also sincerely doubt the FDA and CDC have corroborating data to support the COVID jab for nursing mothers, seeing how th at was not part of the initial clinical trials, and follow-up has been scarce. 4In mid-July 2021, Reuters reported To help protect your privacy, Micro so ft Office prevented auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. 5 that \"no trace of mRNA vaccine\" could be found in breastmilk, according to one small study.

But the new results 'strengthen curre nt recommendations that the mRNA vaccines are safe in lactation, and that lactating individuals who receive the COVID vaccine should not stop breastfeeding,' coauthor Dr. Stephanie Gaw of the University of California, San Francisco, said in a statement.\" 2022 \u2014 mRNA Found in Breastmilk Fast-forward to September 22, 2022, and mRNA has been \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 detected in breastmilk or 48 hours post-jab.

This study investigated whether the CO VID-19 vaccine mRNA can be detected in the expressed breast milk (EBM) of lactating individuals receiving the vaccination within 6 months after delivery.\" Here, 11 lactating mothers were enrolled. The first breastmilk samples were collected before getting the shot, to establish a baseline control. Samples were then collected after receiving either the Moderna or Pfizer shot s, for up to six months post- delivery. As explained by the authors: \"A total of 131 EBM [expressed breastm ilk] samples were collected 1 hour to 5 days after vaccine administration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated in EBM using sequential the EV concentrations were determined by ZetaView (Analytik). The presence of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA in different milk fractions (whole EBM, fat, cells, and supernatant EVs) was assayed using 2-step quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The vaccine detection limit was 1 pg/mL of EBM. Of 11 lactating individuals enrolled, trace amounts of BNT162b2 and mRNA- 1273 COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were detect ed in 7 samples from 5 different participants at various times up to 45 hours postvaccination. The mean (SD) yield of EVs isolated fr om EBM was 9.110 (5 .010) particles/mL, and the mean (SD) particle size was 110. 0 (3.0) nm. The vaccine mRNA appears in higher concentrations in the EVs than in whole milk. No vaccine mRNA was detected in prevaccination or postva ccination EBM samples beyond 48 hours of collection ... The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size and the lack of functional studies demonstrating whether detected vaccine mRNA is translationally active. Also, we did not test the possible cumulative vaccine mRNA exposure after frequent breastfeeding in infants. 5We believe it is safe to breastfeed after maternal COVID-19 vaccination. However, caution is warranted about br eastfeeding children younger than 6 months in the first 48 hours after matern al vaccination until more safety studies are conducted. In addition, the potential interference of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA with the immune response to multiple routine vaccines given to infants during the first 6 months of age needs to be considered. It is critical that lactating individuals be included in future vaccination trials to better evaluate the effect of mRNA vaccines on lactation outcomes.\" Does Spike Protein Transfer Through Breastmilk? Now, it's important to keep in mind that mR NA and spike protein are two different things. The mRNA is what instructs your cells to produce the spike protein. When a mother breastfeeds in the days after her injection, she may be transferring the actual mRNA into her newborn infant, whose cells might then begin to produce spike protein. However, this study did not analyze the breastmilk for the presence of spike protein. Even if the mRNA is only transferable dur ing the first 48 hours post-jab , that does not mean it's safe to breastfeed thereafter. The breastmilk could potentially also transfer spike protein produced by the mother's body, and that production, we know, can continue fo r at least four months, and likely longer.

Why? Because it may trigger immune imp rinting. As discussed in \" To help protect your privacy, Micros of t Office prevented auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. Original Antigenic Sin \u2014 The Hidden Danger of COVID Shots ,\" immune imprinting, also kno wn as original antigenic sin, describes a process in which the first antibodies produced against a given virus starts to predominate, making antibodies against newer st rains less and less effective at neutralizing 7the virus.

If a baby is exposed to anti- spike antibodies every day for months on end, wi ll that render them more prone to infection as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates? We don't know, but it's a concern that can't simply be dismissed with a shoulder shrug. Fertility Is Clearly Being Impacted Walensky also continues to cling to the claim that the COVID shots have no adverse effects on fertility, even though real-world data fr om around the world are screaming that something has gone terribly wr ong.

Wolf named Tony Fauci, Rochelle Walensky of the CDC, and Francis Co llins of the NIH as co-conspirators in the genocide. The fact that people like Rochelle Wa lensky, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins, all the 'influencers' who were paid, as we now know, said 'safe and effective', this requires criminal charges. This could be a conspiracy to murder. And members of the media could also be complicit in the murder.\" Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci, Vivek Murthy, Rochelle Walensky change topics so much that even those who still listen to them begin to see them for what they really are. Dictator Biden and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky pushed for seditious vaccine mandates, mont hs after assuring the Amer ican people there would be no mandates. Never before in history has a US president resorted to such measures, which many see as treason and seditious conspiracy. Dr. Jane Ruby said that Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who heads the CDC, is among the Wuhan coronavirus co- conspirators, people and agencies that planned the mandatory injection program in 2015. She added that everything the CDC has done and published on its we bsite and other official communications amounts to fraud and lies in the conspiracy to commit acts of mu rder and terrorism against the people of the United States of America.

SEPTEMBER 1, 2022 Everything that you will read below is the absolute truth. This is what happened during the pandemic and how Drs were silenced and treatment banned. And how the public was lied toabout the virus, to keep the mass vaccination campaign going. In early 2020 when the public first learned that a novel virulent virus was making peoplesick in China and around the world, it made sense to institute public health measures toprotect against it. But, instead of encouraging doctors and scientists to look for ways to treat the virus and ways to keep sick people from healthy people, as has been done with other pandemics in modern human history, government authorities actually actively prevented doctors from treating patients. Tech companies quickly censored and de-platformed doctors who discussed potentially- effective treatment options . Scientific debate was silenced . Instead of any open, honest discussion about the effectiveness of preventative measures and the different treatment options, the world was told that the only way out of the coronaviruscrisis was via mass vaccination. If the public understood that there were options for treatingCOVID-19 and that the infection was likely to be mild in over 99 percent of the people whogot it, they wouldn't be as motivated to get a vaccine. As someone born and raised in China, I (Joe Wang) saw firsthand how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) runs a well-oiled machine, controlling every aspect of people'slives, not for the good of the country, but for the personal gain of CCP party members. In theWest, too, drawing from CCP's playbook , some quickly realized that they could capitalize on human fear and turn the pandemic into opportunity for profit . The CCP used COVID-19 as yet another way to expand authoritarian control, which was not surprising. But Western countries, too, weaponized people's fear in order to roll out unprecedented controlover people's freedom in an unprecedented way. Fear, it seems, is more contagious than any given infection. An imminent\u2014or ongoing\u2014 apocalypse sells newspapers, blows up social media platforms, and can be parlayed into abreathtaking amount of financial gain.

The United States, in second place, had 98. Sixty-one of the world's newest billionaires werein healthcare fields. Among those: an Italian billionaire whose family makes the glass vials for COVID-19 vaccines; an Indian medical doctor whose hospital chain doubled its stock when it shifted itsfocus to COVID-19; the co-founder of BioNTech, the German company that worked withPfizer to make the vaccine; as well as the CEO of the American-based pharmaceutical giantModerna. So, when Jerry Daniels, founder of the Brothers Media Group, opened a panel during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas, with the insight that,\"COVID has everything to do with marketing,\" for a session entitled, \"The Doctor Will Lieto You Now,\" it is not surprising that practically the entire audience was nodding inagreement. \"What is marketing supposed to do?\" Daniels continued. \"It's supposed toinfluence people to take action and do something.\" And much of public health's job is\"messaging,\" that is, marketing the behaviors they want the public to adopt. In the case of coronavirus, the action people have been most influenced to take was to get vaccinated. The marketing campaign surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines has been soProfits Over People The Doctor Will Lie to You Noweffective that, as of August 29, 2022, more than 12.5 billion shots have been put in people's arms. Given the growing body of scientific evidence that shows quite clearly that the vaccines do not work to stop the spread of coronavirus, as well as the hundreds of studies and clinical testimonials showing that they have severe and even devastating health consequences, especially for young people , the fact that so many people continue to accept them is baffling. It is, according to Daniels, a triumph of marketing. For nearly 15 years, from November 2007 to August 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s working definition of a vaccine was, \"A product that stimulates aperson's immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the personfrom the disease. Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.\" But in September of 2021, according to Daniels, American public health authorities changed the definition of vaccines. The new definition, which the curious reader can find under the title, \"Vaccine Basics,\" at the CDC BAM! website , a classroom resource for teachers, became: \"A preparation that is used to stimulate the body's immune response against diseases. Vaccines are usuallyadministered through needle injections, but some can be administered by mouth or sprayedinto the nose.\" The CDC has deleted a key part of the definition of vaccines. You will no longer find the assertion that a vaccine \"stimulates a person's immune system to produce immunity to aspecific disease, protecting the person from the disease,\" anywhere on the CDC website.However, a 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) document ( pdfThe Vaccine Doesn't Work, So the Definition Was Changed ) cites the old CDC vaccine definition.Reposted by, B.

In my experience, one of the most remarkable Medical Doctors that I have encountered during the last three years has been Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, who currently serves as Surgeon General of the State of Florida. To those who are lately finding it fashionable to criticize physicians who did not immediately recognize and call out the risks associated with these ha stily Emergency Use Authorized products, it will be hard to find fault with Dr. Lada po, who was an early member of Americas 2Frontline Doctors. Even though To help protect your privacy, Micros of t Office prevented auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. Wikipedia has to put their spin on his bio, his integrity and bravery through the last three years shines through in remarkable contrast to the vast majority of academic physicians. Ladapo was born in Nigeria, the son of a microbiologist. He immigrated to the United States at age five along with his family. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry from Wake Forest University in 2000. Ladapo received a MD from Harvard Medical School and a PhD in Health Policy from Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2008. Ladapo completed clinical training in internal medicine at Beth Israel De aconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. He is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ladapo had promoted unproven treatments \u2014 hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin \u2014, questioned the safety of vaccines, opposed lockdown mandates, and associated with America's Frontline Doctors, a far-right group known for promoting falsehoods about the pandemic. In a March 24, 2020, opinion column in USA Today , Ladapo argued against lockdowns deriving from his experience in treating COVID-19 patients at UCLA, an assertion he repeated in a later column published by the Wall Street Journal . With passage of time, he became a vocal supporter of Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis' COVID-19 policies that ran agai nst mainstream medical consensus. On September 21, 2021, he was appointed to be the Surgeo n General of the state.... On appointment, Ladapo critiqued the \"senseless\" fear-driven cult of vaccination \u2014 characterizing vaccines as one of the many equally preventative arms of pandemic management \u2014 and would repeal quarantine rules for schoolchildren exposed to COVID-19 as his first execut ive action. The next month, Ladapo courted controversy after refusing to wear a mask while in a meeting with State Senator Tina Polsky, who had been diagno sed with breast cancer and was set to undergo radiation therapy; he defended his actions on the ground that masking hindered effective communication. Ladapo was confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 2022; during background ch ecks, his former UCLA supervisor refused a positive recomme ndation, noting that Ladapo's \"hands-off\" approach towards tackling COVID-19 had violated the Hippocratic oath and had distressed colleagues. In March, Ladapo recommended that healthy children in Florida not be vaccinated against COVID-19; thus, Florida became the first state to contradict relevant guidelines by CDC and the Amer ican Academy of Pedi atrics. All of the \"experts\" who were cited by Ladapo we re not consulted in the process; they disagree with the recommendation and a ccuse him of de-contextualizing their arguments. Since then, Ladapo has shif ted focus to transgender healthcare \u2014 holding professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society as politically motivated, he has restricted gender- affirming counseling, hormonal ther apies, and related medications for transgender and nonbinary children. To my mind, every one of these \"controver sial\" positions demonstrate that Joe is precisely the type of medical leader that we so desperately need in these times. But based on my personal experience, what is most remarkable about Dr. Ladapo is his calm, unflappable demeanor and impeccable moral compass in the face of the hurricane of criticism which he has withst ood. The contrast to the Federal HHS and global \"leaders\" is profound. This is the ty pe of leader that I can follow. What you hear in the Megyn Kelly interview at the to p of this essay is the Joe Ladapo that I know, as usual without any affectation or artifice. As we see other physicians who seek to be identified as central leaders suffering from the effects of egotism and a desire to commercialize ne wfound fame, Joe has maintained an even keel and steady eye on the horizon, and has continue d to maintain a calm and steady hand at 3the tiller. Keep that in mind as you read the To help protect your privacy, M icr os of t Of f i ce pre ve nt e d auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. press announcement and associated epidemiological analysis which he has recently anno unced to the world. This man is the polar opposite of Drs. Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, and Rochelle Walensky. No grandstanding, no self-aggra ndizement. Refreshingly not narcissistic. Today I was asked by One America News to comment on the new study which Joe and his colleagues released three days ag o on October 07, 2022. Here are the key findings, according to the press release: Tallahassee, Fla. \u2014 Today, State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo has announced new guidance regarding mRNA vaccines. The Florida Department of 4Health (Department) conducted an To help protect your privacy, M icr os of t Of f i ce pre ve nt e d auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. analysis through a To help protect your privacy, M icr os of t Of f i ce pre ve nt e d auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. self-controlled case series, which is a technique origina lly developed to eval uate vaccine safety. This analysis found that there is an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination. With a high level of gl obal immunity to COVID-19, the benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men in this age group. Non- mRNA vaccines were not found to have these increased risks. As such, the State Surgeon General recommends against males aged 18 to 39 from receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccine s. Those with preexisting cardiac conditions, such as myocarditis and perica rditis, should take particular caution when making this decision. \"Studying the safety and efficacy of any medications, including vaccines, is an important component of public health,\" said Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo. \"Far less attention has been paid to safety and the concerns of many individuals have been dismissed - these are important findings that should be communicated to Floridians.\" When the press release and associated study results were released, there were the usual attacks. Charlie Christ, running for Go vernor in opposition to sitting Governor Ron DeSantis, stated \"our quack Surgeo n General Ladapo is back with more misinformation. When I'm governor, I'll appoint a surgeon general who isn't a partisan ideologue and who will provid e sound medical advice.\" To which the current Governor's spokesperson Christina Pushaw replied \"Billboard lawyer who failed the bar twice thinks he knows more about science than a Harvard MD/PhD who was previously a professor at UCLA Medi cal School\".

This analysis showed an increased risk of cardiac-related death among men 18-39. FL will not be silent on the truth,\" Ladapo tweeted, citing an analysis conducted by Florida's health de partment that stated that the vaccine poses a \"high risk\" of death.

So, in preparing for recording the One America News broadcast, I wanted to avoid the risk of just gushing about the analysis because it confirmed my own bias. I took the time to carefully review the paper, re ad the references, a nd consider the long list of limitations which the authors carefu lly noted and disclose d. After assembling my own opinion, I called up Dr. Ladapo, who kindly took my call and for fourty five minutes we discussed the various nits and concerns which I had based on both the listed limitations as well as my own observations. As usual, no hyperbole from Dr. Ladipo. Ju st his usual calm, collected demeanor. The (non-peer reviewed) manuscript \" To help protect your privacy, Micro so ft Office prevented auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. Risk of death following SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination in young people in England: a self-controlled case series study.\" which was cited in the Florida su mmary, and which contradicted the findings of the current study (claiming no adverse cardiac effects), was for a different age cohort (12-29) and blended the two (yes, only two) genders - which will quench the observed cardiotoxicity most strikingly observed in males aged 18-39. That study also selected a different (shifted later) timeframe. Of the two, the Florida study appears more rigorous and much better desi gned to get at the underlying truth of the question. As our discussion proceeded, what I found most compelling is that the current Florida study is consistent with the \"pre ponderance of evidence\". In study after study, including even from the CDC and FDA, it has been clear that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products which use non- viral gene therapy methods to express spike protein in the cells of the recipient, are associated with cardiac damage, including disease and death from that damage. The aspect of the study which I find most tr oubling is that it essentially focused on inoculation #2 for the analysis. The data employed were from fairly early in the course of \"vaccine\" deployment, and did no t cover what happens after inoculations 3, 4, 5 or 6. When asked about this, Dr. Ladipo agreed that this was a limitation, and indicated that he hopes to a ddress these effects in future studies of the Florida data. I hypothesize that when data concerning these additional doses are analyzed, one is likely to observe an even more striking incidence of adverse effects and death. The other observation which Florida and Dr. Ladapo has chosen to not highlight is this: \"Non-mRNA vaccines were not found to have these increased risks.\" Badda boom. Now, I have not reviewed the primary data, but it could well be that the relatively low numbers of patients in the study meeting the criteria of \"not mRNA\\unknown\" resulted in significantly lower statistical power for analysis of these groups, and that this observation could be an artifact of the statistical analysis due to this. However, this issue cert ainly merits a deeper dive and more comprehensive analysis (perhaps of the co urt ordered, newly di sclosed CDC V-Safe data?), as if this observation withstands mo re rigorous testing, then one would have to hypothesize that the Spike protein is no t the main cause of the cardiac toxicity, and then we are left with the possibility that the mRNA delivery platform is the problem. This may seem an \"inside baseball\" nuance (notice I am staying with Casey 6at Bat?), but as we To help protect your privacy, Micros of t Office prevented auto matic downlo ad o f this picture from the Internet. previously discussed in this essay, the FDA is using the COVID-19 Vaccines as a \"Platform Technology\" for mRNA Vaccine Trials . Which would mean that every male patient aged 18- 39 enrolled or about to be enrolled in those trials could be at risk for an 84% in crease in the relative incidence of cardiac- related death. 7I just hope that these subjects are being provided with a balanced and accurate disclosure of risk as they are presented with their \"informed consent\" paperwork.

Reposted by, B. FosterSparks Open in browser Well Being: The #1 Killer in the USA, Ages 18- 45 Lives ruined, Families and communities decimated by fentanyl Robert W Malone MD, MS LISTEN LISTEN TO POST \u00b7 23:45 Oct 6Fentanyl is number one killer in the USA for most age cohorts. Unfortunately, the CDC doesn't track deaths in a timely manner to confirm that easily... Buthere is their position: They will say that they don't really \"know\", because\"overdose deaths are spread out across four different death categories: accidents, suicide, homicide and undetermined.\" The implication of this CDC spokesperson statement is that we live in somereality where the 1950s never ended. Where it is either too painful, shamefulor irrelevant for our society to track drug overdoses in a meaningful way. Forme, I think the answer is obvious. I think we can probably all know culturalshame when we \"see\" it. The definition of shame is well known. Shame: [noun] a painful emotion caused by consciousness of guilt, shortcoming, or impropriety. the susceptibility to such emotion. OK - but here is where it gets weird. Searching and shifting though the CDC webpages - it turns out that the CDC writes that it does track overdose deathsthrough a system called SUDORS and another program called DOSE . These are programs that extract data from state death reports. It is a complexprogram and fairly new, but they basically extract IC-10 death codes andother relevant data from state death reports. But many (most) states don'ttrack overdose deaths by drug. So, there is a \"which comes first, chicken oregg?\" problem in fentanyl death data tracking. Could it be that the CDC is hiding the data? Now that has never happened before <sarcasm>. We all know that during the COVIDcrisis, the CDC wascaught numerous times hiding analyzed data as well as not not analyzingdata or reporting data. My fear that that maybe this behavior is not new. Thatthe CDC doesn't want the American public to know that real numbers. So, I am reading pages and pages on the CDC website about how overdose deaths can be tracked (which is quite complex) and this whole systemsappears to be a \"work around\" because tracking deaths from overdosing fromfentanyl does not appear to be a primary CDC objective. I have a goal. I am searching for numbers - fresh numbers. Numbers that support the claims that we are now are 300 deaths per day from fentanyloverdoses (a number I never could verify). Because that is the number that is\"out there\" in the press. But on the CDC site - the actual numbers are STILLburied. For instance, at the bottom on one report - there is a link: \" Drug Overdose Deaths and where does it take me?Then I find what appears to be it. The page with my answers. A June 2022 report - and... the data on the June 2022 report is that from 2020... another dead end. OK- so the CDC most up to date report on drug overdoses is from deaths in 2020 . OK - enough of this.At this point, I have to give up on the CDC for answers as to how fast this epidemic is growing. I have to trust that the non-profit groups working on thisissue have numbers that are trustworthy because our government, near as Ican tell, is either completely incompetent or playing \"hide the data.\" Youdecide. I know which answer I am betting on. Then finally, when digging around - I find some more recent dat a from a CDC website (it turns out there are data on combined drug overdoses). Basically, about 120,000 people will die from drug overdoses in 2022 (the downturn of the curve in 2022 is a reporting bias - as it is an incomplete dataset). That is 334 deaths per day. Now we know where the 300 deaths per daycame from! To put this in perspective, right now -the 7 day rolling average for COVID-19 deaths in the USA is 304 deaths per day. \"Houston we have a problem.\" In the meantime, by extrapolating IC-10 death codes from the CDC databases, various groups have come up with some numbers. Which don't always match the official numbers or each other's numbers. Fentanyl overdoses have surged to the leading cause of death for adults between the ages of 18 and 45, according to an analysis of U.S. government data. Between 2020 and 2021, nearly 79,000 people between 18 and 45 years old \u2014 37,208 in 2020 and 41,587 in 2021 \u2014 died of fentanyl overdoses, the data analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl shows. FOX NEWS Fentanyl overdoses have become No. 1 cause of death among USadults, ages 18-45. NOT COVID-19. Not car accidents. Not suicides. FENTANYL.This is a national crisis.Even CDC will (sort of) admit it. \"If one assumes that the other synthetic narcotics category for those 18 to 45 is 90% fentanyl, then one can argue that unintentional fentanyloverdose is likely the leading cause in that age group. However, because we don't have exact numbers of fentanyl deaths for that age category, wecannot say for certain that this is accurate.\" - CDC spokespersonThis is something everyone agrees on. Despite all of the CDC tracking programs, the truth is that most state crime laboratories and coroner's offices do not track fentanyl-related deaths, andofficial fentanyl death statistics can be difficult to come by. This may or maynot be why the CDC hedges. But what everyone can agree on is that is why the numbers produced by the CDC can only be an underestimate of the true death rate. One thing that shocked me in looking at this data, was that this is not teenagers \"overdosing.\"These deaths are adults, mostly between the ages 25-64! These are our parents and grandparents. These are our adult family members dying of drugoverdoses. What is going on? In reading about fentanyl, it is clear that the problem is multi-factorial. Fentanyl is extremely cheap and extremely potent. It is easily cut into otherdrugs, so that the newly formulated product potency is much greater than theactual product. Because the potency of fentanyl is so high, it is hard to meter out correctly. The tiniest amount can be lethal. Combine this with the fact that there aresome drugs, like marijuana, where people view the product as not havingsignificant toxicity. Basically they smoke a lot. So, on the weekend maybe - they smoke \"a bunch of weed\" and don't realize they have ingested a lethal dose of fentanyl. Yes, this actually happens. This is important. For me, I don't smoke. Heck, I rarely have a drink. I prefer to keep my mind clean. However, I am from California and I have a lot offriends and family that \"used\" to, or maybe still do smoke. What comes to mymind is that one thing people can do to protect themselves, other thanquitting - is to ensure a safe source of Marijuana or other drug product. ButMarijuana in particular is problematic. Maybe it is time for some people toinvest in an aero garden? Better yet, quit. Marijuana is a drug that people userecreationally. It is not in my place to lecture, but knowing this risk is outthere, is it worth it? The other issue is that fentanyl is being cut into cocaine, and this is now a fairly routine practice. Near where I live, there was recently a news story ofmultiple overdoses, which resulted in a conviction. BAILEY'S CROSSROADS, VA \u2014 On Wednesday, a Dumfries man wasconvicted by a federal jury for six overdoses, including one death inBailey's Crossroads. According to prosecutors, Michael Vaughn, 28, distributed cocaine laced with fentanyl at a party in the Skyline area of Bailey's Crossroads . He was convicted on charges of distribution of fentanyl resulting in death and serious bodily injury, and possession with the intentto distribute fentanyl. Then there is this fact: Powdered fentanyl looks just like many other drugs. It is commonly mixedwith drugs like heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine and made into pillsthat are made to resemble other prescription opioids. Fentanyl-laceddrugs are extremely dangerous, and many people may be unaware thattheir drugs are laced with fentanyl. Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are now the most common drugs involved in overdose deaths in the US. The percentage of opioid-relateddeaths involving fentanyl increased from 14.3% in 2010 to 59% in 2017. Then there is the fact that fentanyl has \"cut into, or even replaced entirely, the supply of heroin and other opiates (wiki).\" Fentanyl is mainly coming from Chinese factories and is then trafficked to other countries for illicitproduction and sale. In the United States, a lot of the fentanyl is comingin through Mexican cartels - having been imported from China. Although it is unclear how much is coming directly from China into the USA and thenadded directly to other products for distribution. This is a border securityissue. And the current executive branch (and UN Agenda 2030) position ispro- \"open borders\". To a significant extent, the flood of fentanyl that is killing as many or more Americans than COVID currently on a dailybasis is a consequence of USG Executive Branch policies. Which mayaccount for the reluctance of the CDC to provide timely data. But let's face it. A lot of people were abruptly weaned off of oxycodone when the prescription crack down occurred in 2014 and they have found fentanyl to be a good substitute . There are many who are chose this drug because they are already addicted to prescription opioids or heroin. Most addicts holdjobs, have families, or go to school. They are people that we interact withdaily. They maintain their addiction through time - and are careful to keeptheir addiction under wraps. A dear friend of mine who lives in rural Georgia lost her daughter in 2016 to oxycodone. The backstory was that her daughter had been addicted, gotclean through the help of an inpatient rehab. Soon after release, she went toa wedding where a cousin brought over her stash. They got high together.So, she took the same amount of oxycodone that she had been taking priorto getting clean. Because her body was no longer acclimated to the drug, itwas a lethal dose. This death changed my friend and her family forever. It iscliche to say that that there is nothing worse than losing a child, but in thiscase it was true. I have another friend who we have known since 2003, who has been suffering from addiction for the past decade. Like many now addicted to opioids, she \"used\" to be an alcoholic. After almost losing her marriage, andmonths in and out of rehab to the tune of $100,000+ dollars, she kicked alcohol. Only to find opioids the year after. This addiction has cost hermarriage. Her husband of 20 years finally gave up after a decade of watchingher decline and doing everything possible to save her. Finally, he had to savehimself. I have watched her go from a promising young scientist, with apassion for horses and gardening to a shell of herself. And she is a shell. Hermind is blown. Her body is wasted. Jill and I have had her stay with us - havetried to help her over the years, but she just can't escape her addiction. Theend stage of this addiction is not pretty, not for the faint of heart to witness. Itis devastating. The impact of losing a functioning adult with years of potential left is enormous. An adult who has a family, maybe with children - who is unable tofunction normally in society or dead. Children who have to watch their parentsunconscious on the couch, unable to cook dinner day after day. These drugscause real damage not only to those addicted but to those who love them,live with them and are with them. We all know this. But what to do? That isthe question. Unfortunately, at the individual level - the \"help\" all seems to center around expensive rehab centers.Outpatient centers are generally thought to be good transitions from in-patient to outpatient. But not so good for actual detox. I tried it hard to find \"the official\" number of people who regularly use or are addicted to opioids. That number is curiously elusive. For instance, HHS citesthe following numbers but fails to include fentanyl in their survey instrument . In 2019, an estimated 10.1 million people aged 12 or older misusedopioids in the past year. Specifically, 9.7 million people misused prescription pain relievers and 745,000 people used heroin. They also write that, 1.27 million Americans are receiving medication- assisted treatment (this data appears to be from 2019).The average cost of treatment per episode are enormous. Hypothetical numbers: If each episode cost $32,000 and five million people were treated - that would be 160 billion dollars per year. There are 14,000+ in substance abuse facilities in the USA. In the end, on a national level - what can be done.The non-profit group, Families Against Fentanyl argues that Congress must call fentanyl a \"weapon of mass destruction.\" That the war on drugs must be taken to the next level. That would mean of course, World Health Organization and United Nations involvement. To me, that seems extreme for what is a homegrown societal problem, aided by countries like China and Mexico.Even if we shut down all of these drugs from entering through Mexico, how does the US government stop entry through the Chinese shipping channels?I don't see an answer to stopping the flow of fentanyl in the USA by involvingthe United Nations. I do believe that negotiations with China to stop drugproduction must be a priority for the administrative state. But that is only partof the answer. The bigger issue, the elephant in the room is \"how does America stop its drug addiction problem?\" This is \"our\" problem - we must own it, before we can fix it.In researching this article, I discovered that the CDC puts little effort into understanding this crisis. Outdated webpages and outdated statistics.Government pages that have different statistics from differing years. The lackof solutions and cohesion on these pages is astounding. To say there is alack of resources coming from the US government is the under statement ofthe year. This isn't a \"war on drugs.\" Our government seems to haveopened the flood gates on drugs coming in overseas. Fentanyl addiction is the elephant in the room that the CDC and the US government have virtually ignored for years. To end, below are a few resources and some ideas about what to do and not do if you suspect an overdose.If you suspect an overdose, lay the person on their side to prevent choking.About narcan (naloxone):There is no happy note to conclude this essay with except to love your family and friends, discuss the issue of fentanyl addiction with everyone you know,and keep careful watch.

Ladies and Gentlemen: I trust that you will NOT force this experimental Clot shot on our youth as there is absolutely no sciencebehind it! This regime in Washington is between a rock and a hard place by moving inthis direction by protectingBig Pharma against any liability. As reported. In a shocking story we've been warning you about here on The Charlie Kirk Show, the CDC voted today (just shortly after the recording of this episode, though the outcomewas a foregone conclusion) to add the COVID-19 \"vaccine\" onto the official childhoodimmunization schedule. Charlie goes through the list of the 15 CDC officials whovoted unanimously to approve the experimental vaccine, and after you hear theirbackgrounds this outcome will all start to make perfect sense. ttps://podcast.app/meet-the-cdc-officials-who-added-the-mrna-shot-to-the-official- childhood-schedule-e321977012/?utm_source=ios&utm_medium=share The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Thursday voted unanimously to add aCOVID-19 booster to the official schedule of childhood vaccines though thejabs continue to remain highly controversial and not universally accepted. Previously, on Wednesday, the board voted to make the vaccine \"more affordable for families, should they choose to vaccinate their child,\"according to WFTS in Tampa, via the Vaccines for Kids program. The 15 CDC board members are:Lynn Bahta, RN, MPH, CPH Beth P. Bell, MD, MPHOliver MD, FAAPWilbur H. Chen, MD, MS, FIDSA, FAAFPGrace MDVeronica V. McNally, J.D.Katherine A. Poehling, MD, J. Sanchez, M.D.Nirav D. Shah, MD, JDHelen Keipp Talbot, MD, MPH The Post Millennial noted : Speaking earlier in the morning, Dr. Patricia Wodi said that the Covid-19 vaccine has been placed as a recommendation from 6 months of age andolder. During a question period, one member of the committee raised questions over the vaccine being included on the schedule when it's beenrecommended for use under an Emergency Use Authorizations, to whichWodi said they spoke with the Office of General Counsel, who said that itwould be okay to add. On Wednesday afternoon, the CDC fought back against claims that the move to place the Covid-19 vaccine on the schedule would mean that thevaccine is now required by children. \"Thursday, CDC's independent advisory committee (ACIP) will vote on an updated childhood immunization schedule. States establish vaccinerequirements for school children, not ACIP or CDC,\" they wrote on Twitter. But in fact, at least a dozen states have laws mandating the automatic adoption CDC guidelines to vaccine schedules for kids before they areallowed to attend public and, in many cases, private schools. Fox News host Tucker Carlson explained:\"More than a dozen states follow the CDC's immunization schedule to set vaccination requirements, not suggestions, requirements for children to beeducated,\" Carlson note on his program. \"The point is the CDC sets thestandard, and then it becomes required across the country, and of course,they already know that.\" Naturally, there are going to be many states who are opposed to the addition of a COVID jab to the children's vaccine schedule, includingFlorida. \"Regardless of what @CDCgov votes tomorrow on whether COVID-19 vax are added to routine child immunizations - nothing changes in FL. Thanks to@GovRonDeSantis, COVID mandates are NOT allowed in FL, NOT pushed into schools, & I continue to recommend against them for healthykids,\" Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo tweeted this week.

They absolutely love it there. For a couple years, I struggled with finding the right school for my 6-year-old, special needs daughter. One that would be able to adapt to her learning differences without ostracizing her.MPMS has done an outstanding job. Not only is she learning, but her confidence and social-emotional skills have soared in these past few months. My 3-year-old son is also learning so much. Listening to him sing the songs he learns at school is adorable. And he's found a love of puzzles and anima ls. The kids have so much outdoor time too, which we believe is vital to a happy spirit. At pickup they never want to leave! In our family, learning is more than letters, numbers, and grades. I sought an alternative school because I wanted more for my children than what a traditional school setting could offer. Inthis school, they are learning life skills. From things like cooking and cleaning, to writing get-well cards for friends. We are so fortunate to have found Mission Possible Montessori School and the whole Microschooling community. I love that my children are receiving a well-rounded education, ina comfortable environment, with caring educators. Best, Jessie JinWARNING - This email originated from outside the State of Nevada.

Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android Dear Department of Childcare Licensing, My name is Charnisa Bradley and I am the parent of Madison Smith who has just started her second year of microschooling at Mission Possible. I was saddened to learn that the Department of Childcare Licensing has an issue with the micro schooling program taking place at a residential location. Mission Possible has changed not only my daughter's life but my whole family lives as well. Being in the midst of a pandemic made me realize just how flawed the public school system is and thus our homeschool journey began. Before Mission Possible I felt overwhelmed and stressed because although I was fully capable of homeschooling my child I still wanted her to experience the social aspect of learning. While visiting my local homeschooling fair I discovered Mission Possible. Sending my child there has been the best decision and investment that I could ever make. My daughter has made tremendous improvement, especially in her reading. I believe the learning environment has a lot to do with that because it is a home away from home and my daughter gets to have one on-one time with her teacher. All MPM students have their own individual work plans which demonstrates that MPM understands that not all children do well learning the same material at the same pace. My main goal for my child is to continue to thrive in an environment that pushes her to master whatever task she is faced with. Mission Possible is not only a school house but a safe haven as well. Taking this unique opportunity away from our children would only further perpetuate the misconceptions of homeschooling.

I had the opportunity to visit Mission Possible Montessori, a microschooling option supporting homeschooling families, in the Las Vegas area during the previous school year. It was a warm and welcoming environment. The children, all being safely cared for, were happy and engaged in various learning activities. I spoke with these children about their microschooling experience, and it was clear how much Mission Possible Montessori means to them. I was delighted to learn that one of the children attending Mission Possible is a recipient of the TOTS grant that I passed during the 2021 legislative s ession. I couldn't be happier that this particular parent found such an appealing option for her special needs child. I support the work being done and Mission Possible Montessori and many microschools serving learners here in Nevada. They have taken it u pon themselves to create a homeschooling support program for the families they serve, and have turned this program into an environment that is treasured by the families they serve. This is a resource that is serving a need in Southern Nevada, one that has strengthened their community, served children well, and provided hours of community service.

Thank you!!pTo Whom it May Concern, My name is Fatima, and my daughter is Avery age 7. She started 1 st grade this 2022 school year at Mission Possible Montessori. We were desperately searching for an alternative to public school after her year in kindergarten 2021 -2022. I did not appreciate how the public school she attended handled important issues. My daughter also became bored in class as she was surpassing her peers. Many importan t things go unnoticed and ignored when you're a child amongst 20 plus other kids with one teacher. When I found MPM, I knew this was the ideal school for our family. We appreciated how the student to teacher ratios were very small; therefore, more attentio n and focus can be provided for each child's mental, emotional, and academic well- being. I love the structure, cleanliness, and attention to detail this school has as well. It's so fulfilling to have my daughter come home happy, content, and wanting to go back the next day to MPM. Completely different from her year in public school, where she would be exhausted, unhappy, and asking \"when is the weekend?\" She has excelled so much already in her short time at MPM, and it is all thanks to the time and effort from the teachers, and the healthy structure and program of MPM. This school is unlike any other private school or Montessori school we toured and tested, and we are eternally grateful!!!

Our girls' education, healthy and safe school environmentare the most important priorities for us as a family. We have moved cities and states to makesure that our girls have an amazing school that focuses on their wellbeing, education andsafety. One of the reasons why we chose MPM is because it is home based and the preschool is in the same facility as the micro-school. This combination was extremely important to us, as well asa home based environment vs. commercial, location and setup. We pulled our girls from aprivate school so that they can attend MPM. Having both girls at the same place wasmost important. We had them at the same private school, in the same building, same holway...however they were not able to spend any time together at a traditional commercial school. Weseeked the nontraditional education setting for many reasons some of which include: ability ofthe girls to interact with each other, home based setting that enables the kids to learn life skillslike cooking, cleaning etc., teacher to student ratio and the way teachers focus on kids'individual needs. Kids at MPM learn to be respectful and helpful, younger kids learn fromthe older kids and vice versa. MPM is an amazing school, with amazing teachers and owners. My girls are excelling in every way possible socially and educationally. It is the safest andhealthiest setting we have experienced school wise starting at public school, moving to privateand finally finding MPM. Forcing MPM to split up the micro-school and pre-school will cause a huge inconvenience and disruption to the parents and kids. We are not interested in a commercial setting as our kidsthrive beyond expectations at MPM. As parents this should be our choice. Coming from alegal, risk and compliance background I cannot stress enough how well organized and safeMPM is and how much our family and kids love this school.

I instantly noticed a difference in her compared to attending traditional schools. Previously my childattended a charter and public school in Nevada. Each experience has affected my child in some ofthe most unfortunate ways. For example, she has become very anxious and unmotivated to learn.The stress had led to panic attacks and overall affected her well-being. This became worse after thepandemic, as she fell behind. When she returned to school, the unrealistic expectation of continuingas if it had never happened was very hard to maintain. Both settings did not care to assist us with asolution, so we felt lost. Thankfully, I researched micro-schooling in Nevada to seek an alternative solution for my child'sdevelopment and learning. Mission Possible Montessori was our 1st choice. They are very attentive.They take the time to understand each child that attends truly. My daughter feels very welcomed ather new school, Mission Possible Montessori. They have created a safe learning environment. I havenever seen my daughter so enthusiastic about learning compared to her in traditional schoolsettings.She is eager to explore and observe all that has been presented to her so far. She loves hands-onlessons, like cooking with her classmates. I am confident s will continue to thrive with MissionPossible Montessori support.
