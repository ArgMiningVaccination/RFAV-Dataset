This includes the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC is the national public health institute of the United States. Its main goal is to protect the public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease. But, what happens when those people in charge of protecting our health and the health of our children do the exact opposite and actually put our children's health at risk? Recently, it has been discovered that top scientists working for the CDC manipulated data from a study which proves that African-American boys are at higher risk of autism after receiving the commonly administered MMR vaccination. The MMR vaccination inoculates children against measles, mumps and rubella. The study shows that African-American boys receiving their first MMR vaccine before 36 months of age are 3.4 times more likely to develop autism verses receiving the vaccine after 36 months. Autism is a mental condition, present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts. CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson issued a press release in which he stated, \"I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal of Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African-American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.\" Those that abuse their power and put our children at risk need to be held accountable. While most doctors act in the best interest of those they are treating, there are a select few whose negligent acts have devastating effects on children and their families. You will carry the burden and expense of your child's care for a lifetime.
