The intention of this retreat is to share the codes of fertility, feel the healing within and integrate the medicine of the wise woman. This retreat shares the natural remedies and wisdoms of the great ancestors, the elders, the grandparents of Mexico Tenochtitlan; for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. This path of the Camino Rojo (Red Road) is one of dignity, peace and self power with the remembrance of our sacred essence. We are so grateful with the presence of our Abuela Tlazoxiuhpapalotl, Grandmother of Mexico who carries the wisdom of , the ancient healing systems of Mexico such as the Mayan calendar, Obsidian Egg + Mirror Healing, Traditional Dance, Doula of Birth, herbal and energetic medicines for all dis-ease in mind, body, spirit. Abuela embodies the fierce compassion of Mother, she walks in her prayer with such integrity and pure love, and we are so honoured to have this opportunity in ceremony with her.
