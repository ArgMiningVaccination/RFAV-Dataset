Herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years, and it has been regaining in popularity recently, but it still has a long way to go behind allopathic medicine. But, what do our ancient traditions teach us? Are they all the same, and how do we know why or what works? There is limited research and evidence, yet we know many of the remedies, at the very least, help with prevention. Nowadays, pharmaceutical drugs are the go-to for every little symptom from headaches and coughs to depression and anxiety. Not only is overuse beginning to be a problem, but these pills can come with significant side effects, especially in the long run...and they hardly ever address the underlying condition of your symptoms. That's why we need to consider alternative treatments for our health. Herbal medicine works holistically. It is a way of life as much as a set of remedies. It strengthens your body, boosts your immune system, and restores your overall health. We have much to re-learn from our indigenous and ancient traditions and wisdom.

Over the years I have seen natural cures used by Native Americans and other indigenous tribes, as well as Chinese TCM. There are thousands of documented cases where natural remedies were used to treat and cure many diseases. Look at journals like PubMed and see all of the natural items that can kill cancer cells, instead of using chemotherapy or radiation, which also kill healthy cells. The reason that these natural ingredients are not used in the mainstream treatment of disease is because Big Pharma, cannot patent a natural ingredient, so it is not in their best interest to try and cure anyone with any disease. Cures do not make them as much money as keeping someone on a prescribed medicine for a lifetime. Doctors prescribe drugs because that is what they are taught and they are supported by the drug companies. This book gives a great overview of some of the natural ingredients and their usage throughout the years. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Amazon Customer](/listener/amzn1.account.AH5KLCAUBNSK4LTZGZ3O3BS2KXFQ?ref=a_pd_Unders_c15_rvlsnl_1&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=VBBWGJXPE7P9TSJ5ZVZA&pageLoadId=1HSNo9ODdStk1dCh&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-25-23 Natural remedies are blessings Do you want to find Herbal Remedies in nature for free?

Woooow, this book is comprehensive! When I started shifting my lifestyle about 15 years ago to include \"Clean Eating\" and chemical-free household and personal products, I knew it was just the beginning. My home is full of homemade whipped body butter ingredients, essential oils and my mother and looked at some local herbal/ homeopathy classes! I literally was just remarking on wanting to learn foraging because I have a deep-seeded fear of being stranded in the wilderness and not knowing what's safe to eat. What I like about this book is that it breaks down the differences between ancient medicines and today \"technological\" advances that really only treat the symptoms and keep you sick versus focusing on prevention or natural healing. This book is going to be a permanent resource for me as it also discusses specific ailments. One in particular that interests me is the chapter on dementia as I come from a long line of fabulous ladies that have been stricken by it. I'm excited to go over this book with my mom and whip up some recipes for overall wellness.

I have always been curious about remedies that have been passed down through the generations of Indigenous and Chinese as I have heard amazing stories.

Love this book There is so much to this book, yet it is simple to follow. I have gained great insights from it. I feel empowered to try the remedies.

I feel this book really educates you not only on the history of the herbs and plants origins but of their powerful healing abilities. I love where the author says \"We have much to re-learn from our indigenous and ancient traditions and their wisdom\" The timing of this book is great, in an age where we seem to have lost connection to what's naturally available to us.

I found this book very interesting. Traditional medicine is largely really just a band-aid for the problem, Cure is replaced with masking the symptoms, not actually dealing with the root cause. In the days of old, before traditional medicine, people sought the Earth for their medicine and often cured themselves. Although we have come a long way since those days and modern medicine has an important place in the world, we can learn a lot from alternative medicine, and this audiobook in my view is an invaluable resource if you wish to seek alternative remedies.
