Staying indoors doesn't mean that you are free from falling ill - a change in weather or season; and even allergies, can bring on infections. So it's important to focus on a balanced, healthy immune boosting diet plan. There are several foods that boost immunity, fruits and vegetables being one of the best foods to include on your plate. Here's a look at the best micro and macronutrients to include in your diet to make sure your immunity is humming along at peak levels. 1. Greens Green leafy vegetables must be a part of your plate if you want to increase your immunity levels. And think beyond spinach and methi - include greens like radish leaves (copper, Vitamin A, selenium), drumstick leaves or moringa (copper, Vitamin A, selenium, Omega-3s), and curry leaves (copper, Vitamin A, Omega-3s). Omega-3 are an essential fatty acid that helps slow down and resolve inflammation. They also boost the functioning of neutrophils, which are our body's responders to infection. Copper is essential for survival - it plays a key role in making red blood cells, maintaining cells as well as the immune system. Selenium - a potent nutritional antioxidant that strongly influences inflammation and immune response. Vitamin A promotes cell growth and development, in addition to regulating cellular immune response. 2. Zinc Zinc is known as the protective & preventive mineral. This important mineral has an anti-inflammatory effect and directly impacts anti-viral activity. Low zinc levels reduce the body's immune responses. It has the ability to function as an anti-oxidant and stabilise membranes, suggesting it plays a key role in the prevention of free radical-induced injury during inflammatory processes. Zinc-rich foods include amaranth (rajgira), bajra, Bengal gram and sesame seeds. 3. Omega-3s Omega-3 Fatty Acids support immune cell function and also help prevent respiratory infections, in addition to addressing and slowing down inflammation. Good sources included nuts like walnuts, seeds like flax and chia, and some kinds of fatty fish, like mackerel, sardines, salmon and anchovies. 4. Garlic Garlic is potent when it comes to taste and smell - but equally potent when it comes to immune-boosting benefits! Whole garlic contains a compound called alliin. When garlic is crushed or chewed, this compound turns into allicin (with a c), the main active ingredient, which helps combat cold and flu. Garlic can be added to a variety of cooked dishes, soups and tonics. You can also chew on a clove first thing in the morning for extra benefits. 5. Ginger Ginger is used widely in Indian cooking, from chai to sabzis and curries. It is known to be a natural remedy for sore throat, cough and inflammatory illnesses, which is why it works well in chai. It has powerful antiviral and antibacterial properties and also helps flush out toxins. Ginger juice shots are a great way to start your day. 6. Spices Spices contain some potent compounds that help fight inflammation and keep infections at bay. Turmeric, black pepper, cinnamon and coriander are all good to boost immunity. Turmeric has an active compound called curcumin which works as a wonder ingredient to build immunity - but for its full effect, it must be combined with some kind of fat (like milk) and black pepper. Dhania also comes with antibacterial properties, which is why drinking coriander seeds water in the morning can boost immune function. Cinnamon has a bunch of Vitamins, including A, B6, C, E and K which helps protect the body from free radicals. 7. Hydration Our body is made up of almost 70% water! And when we lose it through urination, stool and sweat (and excessive sweating when we are ill with fever), we MUST replenish what's lost. Fever leads to excess loss slid loss and increased metabolism, which in turn causes dehydration and increased nutritional requirements. So, even if you aren't feeling very thirsty, you must be sure to drink plenty of healthy fluids and eat hydrating foods (like watermelon, cucumber) to support the immune system and the body's ability to fight infection. 8. Coconut water Coconut water is nature's nectar, full of electrolytes, and the perfect pick-me-up after a workout or any form of exercise. Containing essential nutrients like riboflavin, niacin, thiamin and folates, coconut water has anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties that can strengthen the immune system and fight viral infections like flu. It is also a natural diuretic, helping flush toxins out of the body. 9. Wheatgrass shot Hailed as a superfood, wheatgrass is packed with nutrients that help you build a robust immune system, and helps cleanse and detox the body naturally. It is packed with 17 amino acids, iron and calcium along with vitamins A, C, D, E, K and vitamin B complex. It also aids in weight loss, alleviates inflammation and regulates blood sugar levels. You can take 20 ml of wheatgrass juice (on an empty stomach) in the morning. 8. Vitamin D Studies have found a strong relationship between [vitamin D](https://www.nutritionbylovneet.com/blog/11-lesser-known-facts-about-vitamin-d) & the immune system as well as how it influences susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. You should aim to get 10-20 minutes of sun exposure before midday several times a week. Vitamin D is stored in the body for approximately 2 months. You can also take vitamin D supplements after consulting your doctor or nutritionist.
