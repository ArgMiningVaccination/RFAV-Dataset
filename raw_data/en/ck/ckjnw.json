Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition \u00a9EDQM, Council of Europe. All rights reserved. 4/134 Foreword 1 Supplementing Council of Europe Resolution CM/Res(2020)9, this technical guide is intended 2 to ensure the safety and suitable quality of food contact materials and articles made from metals and 3 alloys. Chemical elements are described that constitute metallic food contact articles or may be 4 present as impurities and specific release limits (SRLs) have been set for those e lements, where 5 appropriate. 6 Information presented in this guide 7 - Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 on food contact materials and articles, defining Guiding P rinciples 8 applicable to food contact materials not yet harmonised by European material -specific 9 measures, such as coatings, paper and board and metals 10 - Chapter 1: Definitions, scope and Specific Release Limits (SRL) for metals 11 - Chapter 2: Safety review and recommendations 12 - Chapter 3: Analytical methods for release testing of food contact materials and art icles made 13 from metals and alloys 14 The guiding principles and technical recommendations are intended to assist national policy 15 makers and to enhance the harmonisation of technical standards across Europe . 16 The European Committee for F ood Contact Materials and Articles (CD -P-MCA) entirely 17 reviewed the 1st edition of this Technical Guide and prepared the present document. 18 This revision was triggered by the adoption of Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 and takes into ac count 19 scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued since 2013 as well as relevant 20 publications by national risk assessment bodies (such as BfR, ANSE S). The review of safety data has 21 resulted in the following changes: 22 - Chromium: the Specific Release Limit (SRL) is set at 1 mg/k g (former limit: 0.250 mg/kg) 23 - (former limit: 1.8 mg/kg) - Thallium: 0.001 mg/k g (former limit: 0.0001 mg/kg) 25 A new section on zirconium h as been added and the SRL is set at 2 mg/kg. 26 Guidance on release testing has been updated to ensure coherence with the 2020 Guidelines for 27 testing conditions for kitchenware made from metals and alloys. 28 The chapter on the declaration of compliance of the 1st edition was omitted in the 2nd edition in view 29 of the corresponding guiding principles stated in the annex of Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 , section 8.2 . 30 5/134 Acknowledgements [text to follow on publication ] 31 Council of Europe Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 on food contact 32 materials and articles [texts closed for consultation ] 33 Abbreviations used in the T echnical guide 34 ADI Acceptable Daily Intake 35 AFNOR Association Fran\u00e7aise de Normalisation 36 AFSSAPS French Agency for the Safety of Health Products 37 ANSES /AFSSA French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health& Safety 38 (AFSSA former acronym) 39 ALARA As Low As Reasonably Achievable 40 BfR Federal I nstitute for Risk Assessment (Germany) 41 BMD Benchmark dose 42 CD-P -MCA European Committee for Food Contact Mate rials and Articles 43 CoE Council of Europe 44 COT Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment 45 DGCCRF Directorate for Competition policy, Consumers affairs and Fraud control (Ministry of 46 Economy and Finances, France) 47 EFSA European Food Safety Authority 48 EMA /EMEA European Medicines Agency (EMEA previous acronym) 49 EPA Environmental Protection Agency (USA) 50 EVM UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals 51 FAO United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation 52 FCM Food Contact Material(s) 53 FSA Food Standards Agency (UK) 54 GMP Good Manufacturing Practice 55 ICH, international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of 56 pharmaceuticals for human use 57 IPCS INCHEM International Programme on Chemical Safety - Chemical Safety Information from 58 Intergovernmental Organisations 59 JECFA Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives 60 LOAEL Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level 61 NOAEL No Observed Adverse Effect Level 62 6/134 PDE Permitted Daily Exposure (as used in the ICH Guideline on elemental impurities, ICH Q3D) 63 PMTDI Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake 64 P-SC-EMB Committee of Experts on Packaging Materials for Food and Pharmaceutical Products 65 PTMI Provisional Tolerable Monthly Intake 66 PTWI Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake 67 QM Maximum permitted Quantity of a substance in a food contact material 68 RASFF Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed 69 RDI Recommended Daily Intake 70 RfD Reference Dose (established by EPA - maximum acceptable oral dose of a toxic substance 71 derived from the NOAEL) 72 RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Netherlands) 73 SCF EU Scientific Committee on Food 74 SR Specific Release 75 SRL Specific Release Limit 76 SML Specific Migration Limit 77 SML (T) Specific Migration Limit (expressed as total of moiety or substances indicated) 78 TDI Tolerable Daily Intake 79 TWI Tolerable Weekly Intake 80 WHO World Health Organisation 81 7/134 CHAPTER 1 8/134 Chapter 1 - General provisions and specific release limits 82 (SRLs) for metals 83 Introduction 84 Metals and alloys are used in food contact materials and articles in food-processing 85 equipment, containers and household utensils as well as in foil used to wrap food. These materials are 86 frequently used as a safety barrier between the food and the environment. They are often covered by 87 a coating to reduce ion release into foods. 88 Metal ions can be released from materials into food and may endager the health of the 89 consumer if the intake exceeds the toxicological ref erence value, or may unacceptably alter the 90 composition of the food or its organoleptic characteristics . Consequently , it was decided to establish 91 technical guidance in this area. 92 Objectives 93 The Technical guide on metals and alloys used in food contact materials and articles 94 supplements the guiding principles stated in Resolution CM/Res(2020)9. It is not legally binding and is 95 intended to assist national regulators when preparing or updating legal provisions on food contact 96 materials made from metals and alloys , with a view to harmonising regulations and enforcement 97 activities at the European level. 98 Safety review s of single metals and the restrictions defined for metals and alloys used in food 99 contact materials and articles are updated regularly to keep up with s cientific and technical progress. 100 Practical recommendations for release testing and checking compliance with the applicable 101 restrictions provide support to manufacturers, importers and control laboratories. 102 Involvement of national experts and stakeholders 103 Governments of Council of Europe member states1 participated actively in the elaboration of 104 the updated document ation. Their representatives in the European Committee for Food Contact 105 Materials and Articles (CD-P-MCA) are experts in the area of food contact materials or responsible for 106 the implementation of government policies in their national ministries. 107 Whereas Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 was approved by the Council of Europe 's Committee of 108 Ministers, the t echnical guide has not been submitted for approval in view of it s technical nature and 109 the need for timely updates . 110 1 Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Pola nd, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, North Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine and United Kingdom. 9/134 The European Commission (EC), the EC 's Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Food 111 Safety Authority (EFSA) participate in the work of the CD-P -MCA . 112 Experts from national authorities, the JRC, industry, private testing laboratories and other 113 stakeholders share their knowledge and expertise and contribute in the updating of this technical 114 guide as members of the ad hoc groups in the field of metals and alloys . 115 The draft revised Technical guide was subject to further consultations with relevant 116 professional associations and industry representatives. 117 Legal status of the technical guide and link with the European 118 Union 119 The Council of E urope technical guides are not legally bindi ng for member states, but serve as 120 a reference for the implementation of Article 3 paragraph 1 of Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004, where 121 applicable. The member states may include reference to these guides in national provisions or 122 transpose the text into national law. 123 Definitions, scope and Specific Release Limits (SRL) 124 1. Definitions 125 The definitions of the resolution appl y in the context of this Technical Guide. 126 In addition, the following definitions apply: 127 1.1. Metals 128 Metals are characterised by their chemical and physical properties in the solid state: 129 - reflectivity, which is responsible for the characteristic metallic lustre; 130 - electrical conductivity, which decreases with increasing temperature; 131 - thermal conductivity; 132 - mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility. 133 Metals are the class of materials linked, on an atomic scale, by metallic bonds. They can be considered 134 an array of positive metallic ions forming long -range crystal lattices in which valency electrons are 135 commonly shared throughout the structure. 136 1.2. Alloys 137 An alloy is a metallic material composed of two or more elements. Alloys are homogeneous at a 138 macroscopic scale and their components cannot be separated by mechanical mea ns. 139 1.3. Release 140 10/134 Release is defined herein as the unintentional transfer to food of metal ions from food contact 141 materials and articles made of metal or alloy. 142 2. Scope 143 2.1. Included in the scope 144 The provisions laid down in this chapter apply to the unintentional release of certain metal ions from 145 materials and articles at the end-use level, coated or uncoated, made completely or partially of metals 146 and alloys, manufactured or imported into Europe, which in their finished state: 147 a. are intended to be brough t into contact with food; or 148 b. are already in contact with food and were intended for that purpose; or 149 c. can reasonably be expected to be brought into contact with food or to transfer their constituents to 150 food under normal or foreseeable conditions of use. 151 Examples : household utensils , kitchen appliances and industrial processing equipment such as food 152 processors, wrapping, containers, pots, blenders, knives, forks, spoons, etc. 153 2.2. Excluded from the scope 154 These provisions do not apply to: 155 a. metals an d alloys used in food contact materials and articles that are covered by an organic surface 156 coating that has been demonstrated to restrict release of metal ions to less than the applicable specific 157 release limit (SRL); 158 b. ceramics, enamels, crystal glass, printing inks, polymerisation aids and other types of food contact 159 materials, which are either covered by specific legislation in the EU or at national level or by Council of 160 Europe resolutions; 161 c. food contact materials that were designed to release certa in substances into the food (so -called 162 \"active food contact materials\"); such materials have been addressed in EU legislation on active food 163 contact materials [Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 and Regulation (EC) No. 45 0/2009] . 164 Contribution to the total intak e of metal ions due to other sources of exposure than metals and alloys 165 used in food contact materials and articles are taken into consideration by applying allocation factors, 166 where appropriate, when deriving specific release limits (SRLs). 167 3. Labelling 168 In addition to the requirements in Article 5 of Resolution CM/Res(2020)9 , manufacturers of metallic 169 food contact materials and articles should provide information on the composition as applicable (e.g. 170 when the content of impurities has been restricted) and their use to reduce the risk for unintentional 171 release. 172 Temperature and storage time are known to influence the release of metal ions from metals and alloys 173 used in food contact materials and articles into certain types of foodstuff. Thus, labelling coul d be used 174 to highlight restrictions for the storage and processing of strongly acidic, alkaline or salted foodstuffs 175 11/134 to minimise the phenomenon of corrosion. The labelling could also include guidance on the storage 176 temperature of foods in order to minimise release. However, producers shall take the foreseeable use 177 by consumers into account and therefore they should consult the guidelines on Testing conditions for 178 kitchenware articles in contact with food stuffs: Plastics, Metals, Silicone & Rubber2 or its r evisions. 179 The labelling could, for example, states : 180 - \"User information: do not use this equipment with acidic or alkaline or salted foodstuffs\"; or 181 - \"Exclusively for use with non-acidic foodstuffs stored in refrigerators\"; or 182 - \"Keep below 5 \u00b0C if the food is to be stored for longer than 24 hours\". 183 If users must initially wash the material, then the labelling should provide appropriate cleaning and 184 care instructions. 185 Remark s: It should be recognised that industrial use and household use of food c ontact materials may 186 vary extensively . 187 An industrial environment usually implies: 188 - in-process controls; 189 - repeated use of the same equipment according to standard conditions; 190 - selection and qualification of the food contact material (equipment or packaging) for a given range 191 of foodstuffs and its use; 192 - possible liability of the manufacturer in case of harm to consumers. 193 Household use usually implies: 194 - a wide range of foodstuffs and contact conditions; 195 - uncontrolled use of utensils limited only by concepts such as \" current practice\" or reasonably 196 foreseeable use conditions. 197 4. Specific release limits (SRLs) 198 Food contact materials and articles within the scope of this Technical Guide comply with the specific 199 release limits (SRLs) set out below in Table 1 and Table 2. SRLs are expressed in mg/kg food . 200 Table 1 - SRLs for metals and alloy components 201 Symbol Name SRL [mg/kg food] Al Aluminium 5 Sb Antimony 0.04 (III) 1* 2 Beldi G., Senaldi C., Robouch P. and Hoekstra E.

However, the ALARA3 principle should be applied. 216 Establishing an SRL: 217 Toxicological information, the ALAR A principle where appropriate or relevant legislation is considered. 218 Each metal ion requires a specific approach for setting an SRL, avoiding either over -conservative specific 219 release limits or limits where compliance would not be possible. 220 The following criteria are also considered when defining a specific release limit: 221 - appropriate toxicological reference values, (e.g. JECFA, EFSA or national risk assessment bodies); 222 - appropriate exposure assessments, based on oral intake data from food, drinking wat er and other 223 sources from several European countries; 224 - allowances for food contact materials as one possible source for the human exposure (next to food 225 and dietary supplements): expressed as percentage of the toxicological reference value; 226 - actual r elease data: rather than setting an SRL on the basis of toxicological reference values, actual 227 release data may serve to define technically lowest feasible levels (ALARA) and levels usually achieved 228 with GMP ; 229 - any regulations governing the presence of m etal ions in foodstuffs must be taken into consideration 230 to avoid conflicts between standards. 231 Based on the above criteria, the following model approach was used to set SRL for metals used in food 232 contact materials: 233 Criterion 1: appropriate toxicological r eference values exist and oral intake data of sufficient quality 234 are available. 235 Calculation of the SRL: 236 (i) For oral intake data of sufficient quality not exceeding the toxicological limit: based on the 237 toxicological reference value and a variable, justified allowance in the case of a gap between worst - 238 case oral intake (95th percentile) and the toxicological reference value; 239 Examples in this guide : Cu, Mo, Zn. 240 (ii) For oral intake data of sufficient quality exceeding the toxicological limit: based on the ALARA 241 principle; 242 Example in this guide : Al. 243 Criterion 2: appropriate toxicological reference values exist, but insufficient or no oral intake data are 244 available. 245 3 ALARA is an acronym for \"As Low As Reasonabl y Achievable\". The term \"ALARA principle\" is used in reference to chemi cal or rad iation exposure levels where social, technical, economic, practical, or public policy consider ations seek to achieve a s mall but acce ptable level of risk. 14/134 Calculation of the SRL: based on the toxicological reference value and a fixed allowance of 20 %, which 246 is in agreement with the WHO \" Drinking Water Guidelines\" (WHO, 2017)4. 247 Examples in this guide: Co and Ni . 248 Criterion 3: appropriate toxicological reference values do not exist, but oral intake data are available. 249 Calculation of the SRL: 250 (i) based s olely on appropriate oral intake data; as no toxicologically derived limit exists, no allowance 251 can be applied. 252 Examples in this guide: Ag and V . 253 (ii) for varying oral intake data; as no toxicologically derived limit exists, based on the ALARA principle; 254 Example in this guide : Fe. 255 Criterion 4: Metals without an SRL. 256 Setting SRLs for Mg and Ti was not considered necessary . 257 Criterion 5: metals and metalloids considered as impurities. 258 Calculation of the SRL: based on a fixed allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference values is 259 applied independently of oral intake data with the exception of Cd (25% allowance) and Pb (26% 260 allowance). 261 Examples in this guide: As, Ba, Be, Cd, Hg, Li, Pb and Tl. 262 Criterion 6: appropriate toxicological reference values exist, actual release data show much lower 263 release when using good manufacturing practice. 264 In order to ensure the use of GMP a lower release limit was chosen. 265 Example in this guide: Cr. 266 Updat ing of th e Technical Guide and further provisions or guidanc e 267 When updating t his Technica l Guide the technical specifications for metals and alloys defined in 268 International (ISO) and European standards ( CEN) should also be taken into account, as well as national 269 legislation on the composition of metals and alloys. 270 4 Guidelines for drinking -water quality: fourth edition incorporating the first addendum.

DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 15/134 CHAPTER 2 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 16/134 Chapter 2 - Safety review and recommendations 271 Metals and alloy components 272 The following metals are relevant metals and alloy components used in food contact materials and 273 articles. 274 Aluminium (Al) 275 Antimony (Sb) 276 Chromium (Cr) 277 Cobalt (Co) 278 Copper (Cu) 279 Iron (Fe) 280 Magnesiu m (Mg) 281 Manganese (Mn) 282 Molybdenum (Mo) 283 Nickel (Ni) 284 Silver (Ag) 285 Tin (Sn) 286 Titanium (Ti) 287 Vanadium (V) 288 Zinc (Zn) 289 Zirconium (Zr) 290 Aluminium (Al) 291 Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is widespread in minerals. 292 Aluminium does not occur in nature in a free element state because of its reactive nature (Beliles, 293 1994). Many of its naturally occurring compounds are insoluble at neutral pH and thus concentrations 294 of the element in both fresh and sea water are usually low, less than 0.1 mg/L. Inorganic compounds 295 of aluminium normally contain Al(III). Pure aluminium has good working and forming properties and 296 high ductility, its mechanical strength being low. Therefore, aluminium is often used in alloys (Beliles, 297 1994). 298 Sources and level s of intake 299 The main source of aluminium is the naturally occurring content in foodstuffs. Mean aluminium 300 content in unprocessed foodstuffs ranges from around or less than 1 mg/kg in eggs, fats and oils, fruits, 301 vegetables or juices to around 5 mg/kg in tea (Kolbaum et al., 2019; Tietz et al., 2019; AGES, 2017; 302 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 17/134 EFSA, 2008). Exceptionally high aluminium content was found in spices, mussels, nuts, legumes and 303 oilseeds (around 30 - 244 mg/kg with highest content in spices). Due to procession or usage of 304 aluminium- containing food additives, aluminium content of processed foodstuffs can be higher than 305 for the respective raw products (e.g for bitter chocolate, sugar, confectionary coffee, cocoa and tea 306 infusions (Kolbaum et al., 2019; Tietz et al., 2019). It should be noted, that in the EU the use of 307 aluminium and its salts as a food additive is regulated in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and strictly 308 related to a limited number of applications such as scones and aluminium decoration in confectionery. 309 Mean dietary exposure from water and food in non -occupational exposed adults showed large 310 variations between the different countries and, within a country, between different surveys. In studies 311 from the late 1990s and early 2000s as summarised in EFSA (2008), it ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 mg/kg 312 body weight/week. In children, estimated exposure at the 97.5th percentile ranged from 0.7 and 1.7 313 mg/kg body weight/week. In recent studies the estimated weekly intake was lower: ANSES (2011) 314 estimated a weekly alumini um intake for adults from food of 0.28 - 0.49 mg/kg body weight/week 315 (mean - 95th percentile), and for children (3 - 14 years) of 0.44 - 0.83 mg/kg body weight/week. ANSES 316 (2016) estimated a weekly intake for infants (0 - 3 years) from food of 0.21 - 0.62 mg/kg body 317 weight/week (mean - 90th percentile). Estimated exposure of Austrian infants (0 - 6 months) fed with 318 infant formula was in the same range (AGES, 2017). Kolbaum et al. (2019) and Tietz et al. (2019) 319 estimated the weekly aluminium intake of German adults from food to 0.18 - 0.44 mg/kg body 320 weight/week (mean - 95th percentile). Food groups with the highest impact on overall aluminium 321 uptake were instant tea and tea beverages, vegetables and salads, bitter chocolate, cereals and cereal 322 products like bread and rolls (Kolbaum et al., 2019; Tietz et al., 2019; ANSES, 2011). However, the main 323 food groups accounted for only ca. one third of the overall aluminium intake. Contributors to the 324 remaining two thirds of the overall intake are diversely distribute d among food groups and cannot be 325 assigned to a specific consumption pattern (Kolbaum et al., 2019; Tietz et al., 2019). 326 Significant non-dietary sources of exposure to aluminium can be medicines (e.g. antacids or buffered 327 aspirins) (Krewski et al., 2007) and cosmetics via oral and dermal route (e.g. antiperspirants) (AFSSAPS, 328 2011; Tietz et al. 2019). However, recent studies showed, that the dermal uptake of aluminium and 329 its salts may be significantly lower than estimated from earlier studies (SCCS, 2020) 330 Metallic food contact materials 331 Aluminium is widely used in food contact materials such as saucepans, aluminium-lined cooking 332 utensils, coffee pots, and in packaging products such as food trays, cans and can closures (Elinder and 333 Sj\u00f6gren, 1986). Alumin ium food contact materials are often coated with a resin -based coating. 334 Aluminium alloys for food contact materials may contain alloying elements such as magnesium, 335 silicon, iron, manganese, copper and zinc (European Standard EN 601; European Standard EN 6 02). 336 Other food contact materials 337 Certain aluminium compounds are used in pigments (Elinder and Sj\u00f6gren, 1986). 338 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 18/134 Release 339 Aluminium and its various alloys are highly resistant to corrosion (Beliles, 1994). When exposed to 340 air, the metal almost immed iately develops a thin film of Al 2O3. The reaction then slows because this 341 film seals off oxygen, preventing further oxidation or chemical reaction. The film is colourless, tough 342 and non -flaking. Few chemicals can dissolve it (Beliles, 1994). 343 Aluminium r eacts with acids. Pure aluminium is attacked by most dilute mineral acids. At neutral pH, 344 aluminium hydroxide has limited solubility. However, solubility increases markedly at pH below 4.5 345 and above 8.5 (Elinder and Sj\u00f6gren, 1986). Alkalis rapidly attack b oth pure and impure aluminium and 346 dissolve the metal (Hughes, 1992). Therefore, aluminium can be released from uncoated surfaces in 347 contact with foodstuffs. Furthermore, aluminium can be released from coated food contact materials 348 if the coating does not a ct as a functional barrier. Release of aluminium from food contact materials 349 depends to a large extent on the pH of the foodstuffs. High salt concentrations (over 3.5% NaCl) can 350 also increase ion release. Use of aluminium saucepans and aluminium -lined cook ing utensils and 351 containers may increase the content of aluminium in certain types of foodstuffs, especially during 352 long-term storage of strongly acidic, alkaline or salty foodstuffs. In general, cooking in aluminium 353 vessels increased the content in the fo odstuffs by less than 1 mg/kg for about half of foodstuffs, and 354 less than 10 mg/kg for 85% of the foodstuffs examined by Pennington and Jones (1989). Boiling tap 355 water in an aluminium pan for 10 or 15 minutes can result in aluminium release of up to 1.5 mg/L, 356 depending on the acidity of the water and the chemical composition of the aluminium utensils 357 (Gramiccioni et al., 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1993; Mei et al., 1993; Nagy et al., 1994) but values up to 5 mg/L 358 have been reported in one study (Liukkonen -Lilja a nd Piepponen, 1992). Acidic foodstuffs such as 359 tomatoes, cabbage, rhubarb and many soft fruits most frequently take up more aluminium from 360 containers (Hughes, 1992). While acids give the highest figures, alkaline foodstuffs (less common) and 361 foodstuffs wit h much added salt also increase aluminium uptake (Hughes, 1992; Gramiccioni et al., 362 1996). 363 Temperature and storage time are known to influence the release of aluminium into foodstuffs. In a 364 release study using 3% acetic acid, the release was approximately 10-fold higher at 40 \u00b0C compared to 365 5 \u00b0C after 24 hours (Gramiccioni et al., 1989). Typical values for release of aluminium from foil was 366 <0.05 mg/dm2 at 5 \u00b0C and, correspondingly, 6 mg/dm2 at 40 \u00b0C. However, after 10 days, the release 367 was considerably hi gher: 0.5 mg/dm2 at 5 \u00b0C compared to 96 mg/dm2 at 40 \u00b0C (Gramiccioni et al., 368 1989). Baking different types of meat wrapped in aluminium foil showed an increased aluminium 369 release compared to raw meat up to 5 -fold depending on the temperature (up to 17.2 mg Al/kg wet 370 weight) (Turhan, 2006). 371 Combined effects of high temperatures during baking or grilling and salt/low pH (addition of vinegar) 372 on aluminium release were demonstrated by baking fish in aluminium foil. Baking the fish without any 373 addition of salt and vinegar led to increased aluminium content up to 4 -fold (up to 0.4 mg Al/kg wet 374 weight) compared to the raw fish. When salt and vinegar were added, the aluminium content was 375 increased up to 68 -fold (up to 5 mg Al/kg wet weight) (Ranau et al., 2001). 376 Sander et al. (2018) showed aluminium release of up to 20 mg/kg from uncoated aluminium menu 377 trays into sauerkraut juice, tomato puree and applesauce, during cook & chill process. 378 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 19/134 Safety aspects 379 - In 1988, the JECFA established a PTWI at 7 mg/kg body weight/week for total aluminium 380 intake, including food additive uses of aluminium salts, which was subsequently lowered to 1 mg/kg 381 body weight/week in 2006 (JECFA, 1989, 2006). In the light of new data, JECFA reassessed aluminium 382 in 2011 and introduced a n ew PTWI of 2 mg/kg body weight/week based on a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg 383 body weight/day and an uncertainty factor of 100 (JECFA, 2012). 384 The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) agreed on the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg 385 bw/day used by JECFA for risk assessment ( SCCS, 2020) 386 In 2017, the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER, 387 2017) published an opinion on tolerable intake of aluminium with regard to adapting the migration 388 limits for aluminium in toys. SCHEER established a TDI of 0.3 mg/kg body weight based on the same 389 NOAEL of 30 mg/kg body weight per day. 390 - WHO states that \"a health -based value of 0.9 mg/L could be derived from the JECFA PTWI 391 (2006), but this value exceeds practicable levels based on optimisation of the coagul ation process in 392 drinking-water plants using aluminium- based coagulants\" (WHO , 2017). 393 - Directive 2020/2184/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption gives a 394 standard value of 0.2 mg/L for water for human consumption as a compromise between the practical 395 use of aluminium salts in drinking water treatment and discolouration of distributed water. 396 - Only a small amount of ingested aluminium is absorbed (mean 0.1% according to EFSA 2008). 397 After absorption, aluminium is mainly (80 - 90%) ( Priest, 1995) excreeted via urine. Unexcreeted 398 aluminium is distributed into all tissues, accumulation takes place especially in the bones, muscels, 399 kidney and brain (COT, 2013; EFSA, 2008; JECFA , 2012). However, soluble aluminium salts are more 400 easily absor bed. Patients with impaired renal function treated by dialysis could show a higher 401 aluminium blood level. In the past, some of these dialysis patients have shown neurological symptoms 402 of aluminium intoxication due to an inappropriate treatment that is no l onger used; these symptoms 403 were sometimes mistaken for those of Alzheimer's disease. The WHO (IPCS, 1997) concluded that a 404 causal relationship between aluminium intake and Alzheimer's disease could not be inferred by these 405 studies. 406 - In 2008, EFSA (2008) confirmed the PTWI of 1 mg/kg body weight/week previously 407 established by JECFA in 2006. In 2018, EFSA reviewed new toxicological evidence but not with the aim 408 of revising the healthbased guidance value for aluminium set by EFSA in 2008 (EFSA, 2018). 409 Conclusions and recommendations 410 \"the SRL for aluminium of 5 mg/kg is reasonably achievable\" 411 In the case of aluminium, exposure of certain groups of the population is close to or exceeds the PTWI 412 derived by JECFA (2012) of 2 mg/kg body weight/week (Tietz et al. , 2019) and the TDI of 0.3 mg/kg 413 body weight per day accepted by SCHEER (SCHEER, 2017). Certain food contact materials and articles 414 contribute to the dietary intake of aluminium. Therefore, it is recommended that the specific release 415 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 20/134 limit for aluminium be set at a level that is as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Such an approach 416 ensures that the manufacturer apply measures to prevent and reduce the release of aluminium from 417 food contact materials and articles as far as possible in order to protect public health. 418 Data provided by industry and member states show that the SRL of 5 mg/kg is reasonably achievable 419 at present. 420 This specific release limit should be subject to regular review to take account of the advance of 421 scientific and techn ical knowledge and improvements in good manufacturing practice. 422 Based on the current state of the art and available release data from uncoated aluminium FCM (Milana 423 et al. , 2019), it is considered necessary to limit the categories of food that may be in co ntact with 424 uncoated aluminium articles and to introduce adequate labelling for users (Regulation (EC) No 425 1935/2004, Art.15) 426 It should be noted that food contact materials and articles made from aluminium coming into contact 427 with food must comply with the following additional recommendations: 428 - Contact with acidic (e.g. fruit juices), alkaline (e.g. lye dough products) or salty, liquid 429 foodstuffs in uncoated aluminium utensils should be limited in order to minimise release. 430 - The producer should provide specific labelling for users of aluminium materials or articles 431 not coated with a protective coating. With regard to retail packs, the suppliers must ensure that these 432 are labelled with appropriate information for the end consumer. The labelling should in clude the 433 following (or equivalent) icon 434 435 and the following statement : DO NOT USE WITH : ACIDIC FOOD (e.g. pealed fruit, tomatoes, pickles, 436 salad dressing) - SALTY FOOD (e.g. pretzel, white herring, cured meat) 437 References 438 AFSSAPS (2011).

Of the Sb discharged into the air, 41% comes from natural sources, i.e. 543 soil particles transported by the wind, volcanoes, marine aerosols, forest fires and biogenic sources 544 (ATSDR, 1992). Human -induced sources of atmospheric discharge include the non -ferrous metals 545 industry (mines, foundries and refineries) and coal and waste combu stion. Sb is discharged into water 546 from industries producing and exploiting antimony and its compounds (ATSDR, 1992). 547 Sources and levels of intake 548 Antimony is detected in most foods, except oils, fats, milk and eggs. Highest concentrations were 549 measured in sugar (8.8 g/kg), chocolate (4.2 g/kg), cakes (3.8 g/kg), meat products (9.9 \u00b5g/kg) and 550 fish (2.6 \u00b5g/kg) (ANSES, 2011; FSA, 2009). 551 In the 20 14 British total diet study the highest total mean and 97.5th percentile exposures were in the 552 age class 1.5 to 3 years and were 0.031 - 0.073 g/kg bw/day and 0.065 - 0.12 g/kg bw/day, 553 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 24/134 respectively. The highest contributing food group to total mean expos ure was the 'Milk' group with a 554 total mean exposure of 0.0098 g/kg bw/day (FSA, 2014). ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake 555 at 0.03 g/kg bw/day in adults and 0.04 g/kg bw/day in children. 556 Metallic food contact materials 557 Antimony is used in the manufacture of tin alloys (it hardens the alloy) to produce Pewter alloy and 558 Britannia metal (regarded as specific type of Pewter alloy ). 559 European Standard EN 610:1995 applies to tin and tin alloys items coated exclusively with tin or tin 560 alloy, or partly tin -plated materials that, as finished products, recurrently come into direct contact 561 with food. It also defines a specific migration limit for antimony (0.01 mg/kg). 562 Antimony can be found as an impurity in aluminium alloys and tin. 563 In France, a maximum permissible antimony content of 2.5% is specified in Information MCDA n\u00b01 564 (V02 - 01/04/2017) on food contact suitability of metals and alloys. 565 Other food contact materials 566 Antimony is used as a fire -proofing agent in textiles and p lastic materials, as an opacifying agent in 567 glass, ceramics and enamels, as a pigment in paintings and as a chemical catalyst. 568 Release 569 During storage of mineral water in PET bottles, the catalyst antimony trioxide (Sb203, which exists in 570 dimerised form) migrates and concentrates in proportion to the time spent in the mineral water 571 (Shotyk, 2006). Concentrations (<1 ppb) are always below the recommended maximum rates, and 572 there would appear to be no immediate health hazard. 573 Safety aspects 574 - WHO (2017) set a guideline value of 0.02 mg/L derived from a TDI of 0.006 mg/kg body 575 weight/day (0.36 mg/day). This value was based on a NOAEL of 6 mg/kg body weight/day from a sub - 576 chronic, drinking-water study in rats, presenting decreased body weight gain and redu ced food and 577 water intake. An uncertainty factor of 1,000 (100 for intra -species and inter -species variation and 10 578 for the use of a sub -chronic study was applied to the NOAEL, resulting in the TDI of 0.006 mg/kg body 579 weight/day (WHO, 2003). 580 - EFSA (200 4) set a SML of 0.04 mg/kg for antimony based on the TDI derived by the WHO. 581 This value is also adopted by Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. 582 Conclusions and recommendations 583 \"the SRL for antimony is set at 0.04 mg/kg\" 584 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 25/134 The SRL was derived from mg/kg body weight/day (0.36 mg/day ) assessed by WHO 585 (2003, 2017). Depending on the metallic material, antimony can be considered either as alloying 586 constituent or as impurity. To not weaken consumer protection, it was concluded that an allowance 587 of 10% of the toxicological reference value was reasonable. Therefore, assuming that a person of 60 588 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared with food 589 contact materials made from metals and alloys, the SRL for antim ony is set at 0.04 mg/kg. 590 References 591 ANSES (2011).

Hexavalent chromium, or 621 chromate, may also be found in very small amounts, usually arising from anthropogenic sources 622 (Beliles, 1994), or present in minerals and rocks in some countries as Greece a nd Italy (Kazakis et al., 623 2015). Cr(III) has the ability to form strong, inert complexes with a wide range of naturally -occurring 624 organic and inorganic ligands (Florence and Batley, 1980). In most soils and bedrocks, chromium is 625 immobilised in the trivalen t state (Florence and Batley, 1980). Chromium (III) is an essential element 626 to human. Chromium is found at low levels in most biological materials. 627 Sources and levels of intake 628 The main sources of chromium are cereals, meat, vegetables, white fish and vegetable oil, while fruits 629 contain smaller amounts (EVM, 2003). Most foodstuffs contain less than 0.1 mg/kg of chromium (EVM, 630 2002; Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). Chromium is present in the diet mainly as Cr(III) (EVM, 2003). 631 According to EVM, most o f the chromium in food originates from food processing using stainless steel 632 food processors and containers (EVM, 2003). The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain 633 (CONTAM Panel) decided to consider all the reported analytical results of chromium in food as Cr(III). 634 This assumption was based on the outcome of recent speciation work, the fact that food is by -and 635 large a reducing medium, and that oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) would not be favoured in such a 636 medium. (EFSA 2014). 637 Dietary intake of chromium from food sources in multiple European countries ranges between 61 -160 638 g/day for adults, with an upper intake of 580 g/person/day (EFSA, 2010). 639 Chronic dietary exposure to Cr(III) was estimated combining the food mean occurrence data with the 640 food consumption data at the individual level. Overall mean human chronic dietary exposure ranged 641 from a minimum lower bound (LB) of 0.6 to a maximum upper bound (UB) of 5.9 g/kg b.w. per day. 642 The 95th percentile dietary exposure values ranged from 1.1 (minimum LB) to 9.0 (maximum UB) g/kg 643 b.w. per day. The adult populations showed lower exposure to Cr(III) than the younger populations 644 (EFSA, 2014). 645 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake of total chromium at 277 \u00b5g/person/day in adults and 223 646 \u00b5g/person/day in children. 647 Metallic food contact materials 648 Chromium is found in some types of cans and utensils. In cans, it serves to passivate tinplate surfaces. 649 Chromium is used in the production of stainless steel of various kinds and in alloys with iron, nickel 650 and cobalt. Ferro -chromium and chromium metal are the most important classes of chromium used 651 in the alloy industry (Langaard and Norseth, 1986). All stainless steels contain chromium (minimum 652 10.5% - see section on stainless steel and alloy) and they are important food contact materials used 653 for transportation (e.g. in milk trucks, for processing equipment e.g. in the dairy and chocolate 654 industry, in processing of fruit such as apples, grapes, oranges and tomatoes, for containers such as 655 wine tanks, for brew kettles and beer kegs, for processing of dry food such as cereals, flour and sugar, 656 for utensils such as blenders and bread -dough mixers, in slaughter -houses, in the processing of fish, 657 for nearly all of the equipment in professional kitchens such as resta urants and hospitals, in electric 658 kettles, cookware and kitchen appliances of all kinds such as sinks and drains, for bowls, knives, spoons 659 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 27/134 and forks ). Chromium is also used to coat other metals, which are then protected from corrosion 660 because of the passi ve film that forms on the surface of chromium. 661 Other food contact materials 662 Chromium compounds are found in pottery, glazes, paper and dyes (Langaard and Norseth, 1986). 663 Release 664 There is only limited information on the release of chromium from metals and alloys used in food 665 contact materials and articles. In one study a comparison was performed between meals prepared in 666 different stainless steel and glass pans. The amount of chromium measured in stainless steel cooked 667 meals was higher for some, but not for others when compared to glass cooked meals (Accominotti, 668 1998). 669 Another study investigated the release of chromium from different stainless steel pots using cold and 670 boiling 5% acetic acid. While, with one exception, no chromium was measured when cold acetic acid 671 was used, release into boiling acetic acid after 5 min. ranged between 0.010 -0.315 mg/kg (Kuligowski, 672 1992). 673 Further, in a market survey of stainless steel cutlery, cond ucted by the German surveillance 674 authorities, elevated levels of chromium up to 43 mg/L were detected. The release was tested with 675 3% acetic acid for 2 hours at 70 \u00b0C. It was noted by the authorities that in particular cheap, low quality 676 cutlery showed the highest release (CVUA-OWL, 2009). 677 Nickel -chromium electroplated articles should also be tested for nickel release. (Whittington et al., 678 2015). 679 Safety aspects 680 - JECFA has not evaluated chromium. 681 - WHO established a provisional guideline of 0.05 mg/L fo r total chromium (WHO, 2017). 682 - The speciation of chromium is of great importance for toxicity. Cr(III), the most stable 683 oxidation state in biological materials, is an essential element for normal glucose metabolism, whereas 684 Cr(VI) is highly toxic (Belile s, 1994; Costa, 1997; Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). Cr(III) has low 685 toxicity due to low absorption (about 0.5%) (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). Toxic aspects of 686 chromium are related to Cr(VI), due to its high absorption, easy penetration of the cell membranes 687 and its genotoxicity and oxidising properties (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995) . 688 - SCF (2003) concluded in its opinion on the tolerable upper level of trivalent chromium for 689 foods for particular nutritional uses and for food supplements , that there was no evidence of adverse 690 effects associated with supplementary intake of chromium up to a dose of 1 mg chromium/day. 691 - WHO (1996) considers that chromium supplementation should not exceed 250 \u00b5g/day. 692 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 28/134 - The EVM (2003) assessed chromium but were unable to establish a safe upper level for 693 intake. However, 0.15 mg Cr(III)/kg body weight/day was not expected to result in adverse effects. 694 This is based on a dose of 15 mg Cr/kg body weight/day, administered to rats as chromium chloride 695 that did no t show adverse effects. An uncertainty factor of 100 was used (10 for inter-species and 10 696 for intra -species variation). This guidance applies to Cr(III) compounds only and excludes chromium 697 picolinate (a synthetic chromium compound with higher solubility and lipophilicity than other Cr(III) 698 compounds, which has been shown to cause DNA damage in mammalian cells in vitro). 699 - In 2010, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) stated 700 that \"a Tolerable Upper limit for chromium i s not available. The Panel also noted that both the limit 701 of 1 mg chromium/day proposed by the SCF, and of 250 g chromium/day for supplementation 702 proposed by the WHO are based on studies that were not designed to test the safety of chromium 703 The Panel also noted that an intake of 250 g chromium/day from supplementation would be in the 704 range of intake of chromium from the regular diet.Therefore, the Panel concluded that until more is 705 known about chromium, the value set by the WHO seems most adequate to limi t the intake of 706 chromium from foods for particular nutritional uses and foods intended for the general population 707 (including food supplements).\" 708 - According to ICH Q3D, the oral Chromium PDE is 10700 \u00b5g/day. Sources of chromium in 709 pharmaceuticals may inclu de colorants, leaching from equipment or container closure systems, and 710 catalysts. Except when it is used as a catalyst, intake of chromium from pharmaceuticals will be in the 711 form of metallic chromium (Cr(0)) or Cr(3+) rather than the more toxic Cr(6+); t herefore, for drug 712 products, this safety assessment is based on the known toxicity of Cr(3+) and Cr(6+) is excluded from 713 this assessment. In 2014, the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) derived a TDI 714 of 0.3 mg/kg body weight per day for Cr(III) from the lowest NOAEL identified in an NTP chronic oral 715 toxicity study in rats. Under the assumption that all chromium in food is Cr(III), the mean and 95th 716 percentile of dietary exposure across all age groups were well below the TDI and therefore do not 717 raise concerns for public health. In the case of drinking water, the Panel considered all chromium in 718 water as Cr(VI) and a BMDL10 of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a carcinogenicity study in mice as adequate 719 starting point for MOE -calculation.The calculated M OEs are mainly above 10,000 and hence indicate 720 low concern regarding Cr(VI) intake via drinking water (water intended for human consumption and 721 natural mineral waters) for all age groups. 722 Conclusions and recommendations 723 \"the SRL for chromium is set at 1 mg/kg\" 724 Considerations for Cr (VI): 725 In water: Data from the literature (Mazinanian et al. , 2016) and member state official control 726 laboratories indicate that release of total chromium [sum of Cr(III) and Cr(VI)] in water is negligible. 727 Therefore, re lease of Cr(VI) from stainless steel FCMs in water, can be considered negligible. 728 In food: EFSA considered as a reasonable assumption that all chromium in food is in the form of Cr(III). 729 Therefore, any released chromium in food can be assumed to be releas ed as Cr(III) and not further 730 oxidise to Cr(VI). Summarising, based on the current state of the art, the adoption of an SRL for Cr(VI) 731 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 29/134 is not necessary. However, EFSA (2014) recommends that further data for the characterisation of 732 Cr(VI) reduction in the g astrointestinal tract at doses relevant for human exposure should be 733 generated. 734 Considerations for Cr (III) 735 Taking into account the TDI of 0.3 mg/kg b.w. per day for Cr(III) which was derived by EFSA (EFSA, 736 2014), a 20% allocation factor and the conventional assumption that a person of 60 kg body weight 737 consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared using food contact materials 738 made from metals and alloys, the SRL for Cr(III) could be set at up to 3.6 mg/kg food. However,sinc e 739 several RASFF alerts exceeding 3.6 mg/kg have been reported, to prevent and reduce the release of 740 Cr from food contact materials and articles as far as possible in order to protect public health, it was 741 decided that a specific release limit for total Cr should be set at 1 mg/kg. Based on the current state - 742 -of-art, this value is reasonably achievable. 743 Following the above-mentioned considerations, the SRL for total chromium is set at 1 mg/kg. 744 Release of Cr into water should be monitored for FCMs intended t o be used in contact with water. To 745 ensure a MOE above 10,000, the release of Cr(VI) should not exceed 0.006 mg/L (BMDL10 of 1 mg/kg 746 bw/day, a MOE of 10,000, a person of 60 kg bw consuming 1 liter water per day). Therefore, if the 747 concentration of total ch romium released in water exceeds 0.006 mg/kg, further investigation of Cr 748 (VI) release is recommended. 749 References 750 Accominotti, M., Bost, M., Haudrechy, P., Vallon, J.J., (1998) .

Cobalt often 803 occurs in association with nickel, silver, lead, copper and iron ores (Elinder and Friberg, 1986). Cobalt 804 is present in the vitamin cobalamin or vitamin B12 (Elinder and Friberg, 19 86). 805 Sources and levels of intake 806 Cobalt is normally found in very low concentrations in foodstuffs (approximately 0.01 -0.05 mg/kg) 807 (Beliles, 1986), mainly in green leafy vegetables. Common plants such as lettuce, beets, cabbage, 808 spinach, and sweet potatoes act as sources of dietary cobal t, with spinach containing between 0.1 -0.7 809 mg/kg on a moisture-free basis (Beliles, 1994). 810 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 0.18 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day in adults and 0.31 \u00b5g/kg 811 body weight/day in children. 812 Metallic food contact materials 813 Cobalt is used for the production of high -strength alloys (Elinder and Friberg, 1986). It can account for 814 between 0.05% and 0.1% of the composition of certain steels. 815 Other food contact materials 816 In the glass and ceramic industries, small quantities of co balt oxide are used to neutralise the yellow 817 tint resulting from the presence of iron in glass, pottery and enamels. Larger quantities are used to 818 impart a blue colour to these products (Beliles, 1994). Cobalt oxide is used in enamel coatings on steel 819 to improve the adherence of the enamel to the metal (Beliles, 1994). 820 Release 821 Cobalt is a relatively non -reactive metal and it does not oxidise in dry or moist air (Beliles, 1994). 822 Cobalt reacts with most acids, but becomes passive in concentrated nitric acid. Cobalt is not attacked 823 by alkalis, either in solution or when fused, but it combines with halogens when heated (Belile s, 1994). 824 Safety aspects 825 - Cobalt is an essential element. An amount of 5 mg in the body is required for vitamin B12 in 826 order to avoid pernicious anaemia, a fatal illness. Generally, cobalt has a low toxicity. Gastrointestinal 827 absorption of soluble cob alt compounds can be estimated to be about 25% (Elinder and Friberg, 1986). 828 Cobalt is used in fertilisers, since a low cobalt concentration in soil may cause cobalt deficiency in 829 sheep and cattle. Cobalt is also used in human medicine in the treatment of c ertain iron-resistant 830 anaemia (Elinder and Friberg, 1986). Even though cobalt is essential to humans and animals, a few 831 cases of poisoning have been recorded. An effect on the heart, blood pressure, abdominal pain, 832 breathing difficulties and, in the worst cases, death were seen after intakes of cobalt via large amounts 833 of contaminated beer (cobalt is used to prevent fermentation) (Elinder and Friberg, 1986). 834 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 32/134 - SCF (1993) scientific opinion on vitamin B12 recommends that daily intake should not exceed 835 0.2 mg/day. 836 - EFSA (2003) confirmed, in an opinion on oleic acid cobalt salts, the classification of cobalt in 837 SCF-List 3 with a restriction of 0.05 mg/kg. This value has been adopted Regulation 10/2011 and was 838 derived by the Dutch RIVM in 1991 based on es timates of total daily intakes. 839 - In 2003, cobalt was assessed by the UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM). While 840 there was insufficient data to establish a safe upper level, they suggested an intake of 0.023 mg/kg 841 body weight/day would not be expected to produce adverse effects. This was based on animal data 842 showing minor testicular effects at 23 mg Co/kg body weight/day with a total uncertainty factor of 843 1,000 (10 for extrapolation from a LOAEL to a NOAEL and 10 for inter-species and 10 for intra -species 844 variation) (EVM, 2003). 845 - RIVM (2001) TDI of 0.0014 mg/kg body weight/day (0.08 mg/person/day) from 846 human data, in which an additional effect from alcohol consumption in the study population was 847 possible. 848 Conclusions and recommendations 849 \"the SRL for cobalt is set at 0.02 mg/kg\" 850 The TDI established by the RIVM in 2001 was derived from human data. Since European intake data 851 are scarce, the default allowance of 20% for exposure through food contact materials and articles 852 mad e from metals and alloys was applied to the TDI of 0.0014 mg/kg body weight/day. Assuming that 853 a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared 854 with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the S RL for cobalt is set at 0.02 mg/kg. 855 References 856 ANSES (2011).

Commission of the European Communities, 877 1993. 878 Copper (Cu) 879 Copper is found at a concentration of 70 mg/kg in the Earth's crust (Beliles, 1994). Copper exists two oxidation states: Cu(I) (cuprous) and Cu(II) (cupric). Copper can also occur in a trivalent state due 881 to certain chemical reactions. Copper is amongst the most effective of metal biochemical oxidising 882 agents. Copper is an essential element to man (Aaseth and Norseth, 1986). Copper also has the ability 883 to restrict bacterial growth, e.g. Legionella in drinking water systems (Rogers et al., 1994). 884 Sources and levels of intake 885 Copper is natur ally present in most foodstuffs in the form of copper ions or copper salts. Generally, 886 the concentration of copper in foodstuffs is about 2 mg/kg or less, the main sources being meat, offal, 887 fish, pecans, milk chocolate and green vegetables (Aaseth and Nor seth, 1986). However, levels of up 888 to 39 mg/kg have been reported for liver and cocoa. 889 In the European Union Risk Assessment Report (EU -RAR, 2008), copper exposure from food and 890 beverages, estimated from a wide range of duplicate diet studies and market basket analysis 891 consistently show copper intakes <2 mg/day. An overall median copper intake of 1.25 mg Cu/day was 892 derived (EU -RAR, 2008). 893 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 1.94 mg/person/day in adults and the 95th percentile at 894 4.1 mg/person/da y. 895 Additionally, exposure to copper via dietary supplements can contribute up to 2 mg/day to the total 896 intake (EU -RAR, 2008). 897 Metallic food contact materials 898 Copper vessels are traditionally used in many specialised food processing activities, such as in 899 breweries and distilleries, for cheese -making, chocolate, dry vegetables, jam and sweets production. 900 In general, copper is used unalloyed for food utensils, for example in saucepans, which are usually 901 lined inside with tin or stainless steel. Copper is used in alloys, particularly brass, bronze, and nickel 902 silver. 903 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 34/134 Other food contact materials 904 No information is available. 905 Release 906 Copper is slowly attacked by dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric acid and is soluble in ammonia 907 water (Beliles, 1994). Acidic foodstuffs can attack copper in utensils. Therefore, copper may be present 908 in foodstuffs due to release from food contact materials, e.g. copper utensils, copper pipes, etc., or 909 from using drinking water from copper pipes for food preparation . In some cases, high copper release 910 may induce some discolouration. 911 Safety aspects 912 - JECFA (1982) established a PMTDI of 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day from all sources and set 913 a dietary requirement is 0.05 mg/kg body weight per day. 914 - WHO (2017) set a guideline value for copper at 2 mg/L in drinking water. 915 - There is greater health risk from a copper deficiency than from excess copper intake. Acute 916 toxicity due to ingestion of copper is infrequent in humans. However, when it occurs it is usually a 917 consequence of the release of copper into beverages (including drinking water) or from accidental or 918 deliberate ingestion of high quantities of copper salts. Symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, acute 919 haemolytic anaemia, renal and liver damage, neurotoxici ty, increased blood pressure and respiratory 920 rates. In some cases, coma and death ensued (Environmental Health Criteria for Copper, 1996). 921 Chronic copper poisoning has not been described in the general population (Aaseth and Norseth, 922 1986). 923 - SCF (2003) and EFSA (2006) derived an upper limit for adults of 5 mg/person/day from a 924 dietary supplementation study. This value arose from a copper dose of 10 mg/day, where no adverse 925 effects were detected, and an uncertainty factor of 2 for population variability. However, this study 926 was characterised by a limited number of participants (n=7) and did not establish a dose-response- 927 relationship. For children aged 1 -3 years, an upper limit of 1 mg/day was derived, taking into 928 consideration their lower body weight. 929 - The UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals assessed copper and derived a safe upper 930 level of 0.16 mg/kg body weight/day based on a NOAEL of 16 mg/kg body weight/day in a sub -chronic 931 rat toxicity study and using an uncertainty factor of 100 (EVM, 2003). 932 - According to ICH Q3D, the oral PDE for copper is 3400 \u00b5g/day. Copper compounds (e.g., 933 copper chromite) are being used as catalysts in hydrogenolysis and decarboxylation reactions. 934 - In 2008, the copper industry submitted a voluntary risk assessment report to the European 935 Commission, which was evaluated by the \"Technical Committee for New and Existing Substances\" 936 (TCNES) and the \"Scientific Committee for Health and Environmental Risk\" (SCHER). A NOAEL of 16.3 937 mg/kg body weight/day was derived from a 9 0 day sub -chronic rat study, which was also confirmed 938 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 35/134 by a two -generation rat reproductive toxicity study. After applying an uncertainty factor of 100, 0.16 939 mg/kg body weight/day was set, corresponding to 9.8 mg/day (EU -RAR, 2008). 940 Conclusions and recomm endations 941 \"the SRL for copper is set at 4 mg/kg\" 942 Since the upper limit derived by SCF (2003) and EFSA (2006) was based on a supplementation study 943 performed with only seven adults and showing no adverse effects, it was concluded to establish an 944 SRL bas ed on the EU -RAR assessment with a human derived value of 9.8 mg/day. 945 The intake data were used to estimate a worst -case oral exposure to copper. Assuming a worst -case 946 intake from food/drinking water at the 95th percentile of 4 mg/day and an additional i ntake from 947 copper supplements of 2 mg/day, a total intake of 6 mg/day can be calculated. Since this worst -case 948 intake is below the toxicologically derived limit of 9.8 mg/day, the difference can be allocated to 949 exposure from food contact materials made fro m metals and alloys. 950 Consequently, assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that 951 is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the SRL for 952 copper is set at 4 mg/kg. 953 Children were not considered as a vulnerable sub- population as done by SCF (2003) and EFSA (2006) 954 because of the negligible exposure of children to food contact materials and articles made out of 955 copper (Foster, 2010). 956 Release due to traditional use, as referred to in Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004, falls outside the scope 957 of this SRL. 958 References 959 Aaseth, J., Norseth, Vouk, V.B.

Iron is used for the 997 production of steel. The principal compounds of iron are ferrous Fe(II) and ferric Fe(III) (Beliles, 1994). 998 Iron is essential for the synthesis of blood pigments. Under normal conditions the body contains about 999 4 g of iron (Beliles, 1994). Haemoglobin contains the greatest amount of iron in the body (67%), and 1000 this is largely in the red blood cells (Beliles, 1994). 1001 Sources and levels of intake 1002 Iron is present in most foods and beverages. In general, liver, kidney , beef, ham, egg yolk, and 1003 soybeans have iron concentrations in the order of 30 -150 mg/kg (Elinder, 1986). In several countries 1004 the cereal most commonly eaten, e.g. wheat flour, is fortified with iron in order to provide the 1005 necessary amount of iron in the diet (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). 1006 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 37/134 Mean dietary intakes from various European countries range from 10 -22 mg/day and the 97.5th 1007 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 7.71 mg/person/d ay in adults and 6.57 mg/person/day 1009 in children. 1010 Metallic food contact materials 1011 Iron is used in a great variety of kitchen utensils. Iron is found in steel cans and in lids and closures for 1012 glass bottles and jars. Cast iron is also used for pots and pans. Iron is the major constituent of steel, 1013 which also contains small quantities of certain other metals, such as chromium, manganese, 1014 molybdenum and nickel (Elinder, 1986). 1015 Other food contact materials 1016 Several forms of iron oxide are used as paint pigments (Beliles, 1994), of which some are also 1017 permitted as food colourings. The soluble salts are variously used as pigments in food contact 1018 materials (Beliles, 1994). 1019 Release 1020 Food contamination by iron may originate from food processing equipment, containers and other 1021 utensils used for foodstuffs. Tests performed on various stainless steel saucepans using boiling 5% 1022 acetic acid as a simulant and a contact time of 5 minutes resulted in iron release betwee n 0.22 -2.85 1023 mg/kg (Kuligowski, 1992). Similarly, a survey of teapots showed iron release between 0.1 mg/L and 1024 4.7 mg/L using a citric acid solution (1 g/L) as a simulant and a contact time of 30 min. (Bolle, 2011). 1025 Rare cases of release of very high quantities of iron from food contact materials such as iron kitchen 1026 utensils have been observed. For example, the release of 2500 mg/kg iron from a wok and a cast iron 1027 skillet were observed under the conditions mentioned above (Kuligowski, 1992). 1028 Safety aspect s 1029 - JECFA (1983) established a PMTDI at 0.8 mg/kg body weight/day. The value applies to iron 1030 from all sources except for iron oxides used as colouring agents, supplemental iron taken during 1031 pregnancy and lactation and supplemental iron for specific clini cal requirements. The value is eight 1032 times lower than the acute toxic dose. 1033 - SCF (1993) evaluated iron mainly to be a deficiency problem. 1034 -WHO proposed that no health -based guideline value be set for iron in drinking water (WHO, 1035 2017). 1036 - The recom mended intake is 10 -15 mg/day (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). 1037 - Iron is an essential trace metal (JECFA, 1983). Iron is mainly a deficiency problem and not a 1038 toxicological problem. Iron deficiency is generally acknowledged to be the single most common 1039 nutritional deficiency in both developing and developed countries (Nordic Council of Ministers, 1995). 1040 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 38/134 Certain iron salts, mainly ferrous sulphate and ferrous succinate, are frequently used for the treatment 1041 and prevention of iron deficiency in humans (Beliles, 1994). Under normal conditions, about 5 -15% of 1042 the iron is absorbed (Elinder, 1986). Ingestion of soluble iron salts by children in doses exceeding 0.5 1043 g of iron can give rise to severe lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by metabolic acidosis, 1044 shock and toxic hepatitis (Elinder, 1986). 1045 - Iron supplementation of more than 30 mg/day could be associated with iron accumulation 1046 indicators in older adults (Fleming, 2002). 1047 - The Belgian Royal Decree of 03 March 1992 on marketing of nutri ments and foodstuffs with 1048 added nutriments sets the maximum authorised intake via food supplements at 28 mg/day. 1049 - In 2006, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies were unable 1050 to establish a tolerable upper intake level as the data available were insufficient. The risk of adverse 1051 effects from current dietary iron intakes, including fortified foods in some countries but excluding 1052 supplements, was considered to be low for the population as a whole, except those homozygous for 1053 hereditary haemochromatosis. Mean dietary iron intake across the EU was in the range of 10 -22 1054 mg/person/day and the 97.5th percentile ranged from 16 -72 mg/person/day (EFSA, 2006). 1055 - The EVM did not consider there to be sufficient data to derive a safe upper level of iron 1056 intake, but they suggested that a supplemental intake of 0.28 mg/kg body weight/day (17 mg/day) 1057 would not be expected to produce adverse effects in the majority of people (EVM, 2003). This is based 1058 on data showing that doses between 50 a nd 220 mg/day cause effects in humans, and using the lower 1059 end of this range and an uncertainty factor of 3 to extrapolate from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. No factor for 1060 inter -species variation was required and, as the data had been collected in large numbers of p eople, 1061 it was not deemed necessary to use an uncertainty factor for inter -individual variation. 1062 - ICH Q3D: Iron is one of some elemental impurities for which PDEs have not been established 1063 due to their low inherent toxicity and/or differences in regional regulations are not addressed in this 1064 guideline. If these elemental impurities are present or included in the drug product they are addressed 1065 by other guidelines and/or regional regulations and practices that may be applicable for particular 1066 elements. 1067 Conclusions and recommendations 1068 \"the SRL for iron of 40 mg/kg is reasonably achievable\" 1069 Since no toxicologically derived upper limit could be set, it was decided that a specific release limit 1070 for iron should be set at levels that are as low as reason ably achievable (ALARA). Such an approach 1071 ensures that the manufacturer apply measures to prevent and reduce the release of iron from food 1072 contact materials and articles as far as possible in order to protect public health. 1073 Data provided by industry and member states show that an SRL of 40 mg/kg is reasonably achievable 1074 at present. 1075 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 39/134 This specific release limit should be subject to a review at the latest three years after the adoption of 1076 this Technical guide to take account of the advance of scientific and technical knowledge and 1077 improvements in good manufacturing practice. 1078 References 1079 ANSES (2011).

It is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and 1119 the third most common metal after aluminium and iron. It is also the third most important component 1120 of salts dissolved in seawater. Magnesium is a metal that has few useful mechanical characteristics 1121 but is very light (one-third lighter than aluminium), is silvery-white in colour and tarnishes slightly on 1122 exposure to air. 1123 Sources and levels of intake 1124 Magnesium is widely used in medicine and pharmacology. It plays a very important role in the human 1125 diet. Many disorders can result from lack of magnesium: depression and a nxiety, diabetes, muscle 1126 spasms, cramps, cardiovascular disorders, high blood pressure and osteoporosis. It plays an active role 1127 in inter -neuronal data transmission (Giannini, 1997; Giannini, 2000). 1128 Excess consumption is naturally eliminated. Intake of lar ge quantities of magnesium causes diarrhoea. 1129 Magnesium is effectively filtered by the kidneys in adults, but poisoning by excessive magnesium can 1130 occur in children and in cases of renal insufficiency (Kontani et al., 2005). 1131 Magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH) 2, ch is reaction between sodium hydroxide and 1132 magnesium salt, is used in medicine as an antacid and also as a laxative (milk of magnesia) and in sugar 1133 refining. 1134 Seafood (apart from winkles) contains 410 mg/100 g, and there is no doubt that this is the food source 1135 richest in magnesium, followed by molasses (from 197 to 242 mg/100 g), cocoa (from 150 to 400 1136 mg/100 g) and whole grains (from 100 to 150 mg/100 g). However, the polysaccharides and phytic 1137 acids that the latter contain impede magnesium absorption, especially in the case of yeasted 1138 wholemeal bread. Spinach contains between 50 and 100 mg/100 g, but it also contains oxalic acid that 1139 can inhibit magnesium assimilation. Fish, offal and bolted cereals contain between 25 and 50 mg/100 1140 g of magn esium. A few other foodstuffs also contain magnesium, buckwheat, broad and bananas. ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 304 mg/person/day in adults and 227 mg/person/day in 1143 children. Highest concentrations in the French TDS were measured in tofu (1340 mg/kg), chocolate 1144 mg/kg). 1145 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 41/134 Metallic food contact materials 1146 Magnesium is mainly used in aluminium- magnesium alloys. It is also used in the iron and steel industry 1147 to eliminate sulphur. It can be used in the manufacturing of spheroidal graphite cast iron, in which the 1148 graphite takes the form of nodules (spheroids) or cast iron (iron and steel industry). 1149 Magnesium is widely used in aluminium-based alloys for permanent set yielding, facilitating the 1150 manufacturing of profiles or beverage cans, which consume large quantities of the metal (Luo and 1151 Powell, 2001). 1152 Other food contact materials 1153 No information available. 1154 Release 1155 No info rmation available. 1156 Safety aspects 1157 - SCF (2001) established a tolerable upper limit of 250 mg Mg per day for readily dissociable 1158 magnesium salts and compounds like MgO in nutritional supplements, water, or added to food and 1159 beverages. This upper limit d oes not include Mg normally present in foods and beverages. 1160 - Magnesium is used in the production of many alloys, particularly aluminium alloys. It may 1161 constitute 11% of some alloys. SCF (2001) and AFSSA (France) (2001) recommended that daily intake 1162 shou ld not exceed 700 mg/day. The Belgian Royal Decree of 30 May 2021relating to the placing on 1163 the market of nutrients and food products with added nutrients sets the maximum authorised intake 1164 via food supplements at 450 mg/day (Recommended Daily Intake). 1165 - The UK EVM assessed magnesium and considered there to be insufficient data to derive a 1166 safe upper level (EVM, 2003). On the basis of the available data from one study showing only mild 1167 reversible diarrhoea in a small percentage of people supplementing ma gnesium at around 400 1168 mg/person/day, this level of magnesium supplementation was considered to be without significant 1169 adverse effects. This corresponds to 6.7 mg/kg body weight/day for a 60 kg adult. 1170 Conclusions and recommendations 1171 \"deriving the SRL for magnesium was unnecessary\" 1172 With regard to the safety aspects mentioned above, it can be assumed that release of magnesium 1173 from food contact materials made from metals and alloys at a level where adverse effects occur is not 1174 likely. Therefore, it w as concluded that deriving an SRL was unnecessary. 1175 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 42/134 References 1176 AFSSA-CNERNA -CNRS (2001).

Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the tolerable upper intake level of 1197 magnesium (expres sed on 26 September 2001), October 2001. 1198 Manganese (Mn) 1199 Manganese is an essential element as a micronutrient involved in different enzymatic activities 1200 (carbohydrates and lipids metabolism, bones formation, healing process, a ntioxidants protection, 1201 etc.). It is widely distributed in the environment, comprising approximately 0.1% of the Earth's crust 1202 (Florence and Batley, 1980). About 90% of total manganese production is used in steel manufacture 1203 as a deoxidising and desulphuri sing additive 1986). Manganese exists common states, as manganese (II) and manganese (IV) (Florence 1205 and Batley, 1980). 1206 Sources and levels of intake 1207 Manganese is present in most foods tuffs. The main contributors of manganese to the diet are cereals 1208 (10-30 mg/kg) as well as vegetables and fruits (0.5 -5 mg/kg) (Beliles, 1994). Nuts may also have a high 1209 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 43/134 content of manganese. In some countries, manganese has replaced organic lead as an add itive in 1210 petrol. This may result in increasing concentrations of manganese in the environment and in 1211 foodstuffs in the future. 1212 The average intake is 2 -3 mg/day (SCF, 1993). The British total diet study reported that the highest 1213 total mean and 97.5th percen tile exposures were in the 1.5 to 3 years age class and were 160 g/kg 1214 bw/day and 270 g/kg bw/day, respectively. The highest contributing food group to total mean 1215 exposure was the 'non -alcoholic beverages' group with a exposure of 43 g/kg bw/day (FSA, 1216 2014). 1217 In the French total diet study (ANSES, 2011), the highest manganese concentrations were measured 1218 in dry fruits and oil seeds (11.9 mg/kg), chocolate (8.87 mg/kg) and bread and bakery products (7.19 1219 mg/kg). The main contributors to manganese expo sure were bread (29%) and bakery products (20%). 1220 It was established that the manganese mean exposures were 2.16 mg/day for adults and 1.46 mg/day 1221 for children. Considering the 95th percentile, the manganese mean exposures were 3.55 mg/day and 1222 2.56 mg /day for adults and children respectively. 1223 The EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) (EFSA, 2013) proposed a s Adequate 1224 Intake (AI) of 3 mg/day for adults including pregnant and lactating women (equal to the mean intake 1225 in EU) . For infa nts aged from 7 to 11 months, an AI of 0.02 -0.5 mg/day was proposed, which reflects 1226 the wide range of manganese intakes that appear to be adequate for this age group. 1227 In the infant diet study (ANSES, 2016) focusing on the 0 to 3 years old population, the highest 1228 manganese concentrations were measured in sweet and salty biscuits (6.26 mg/kg), bread and bakery 1229 product (5.17 mg/kg) and pastry (3.64 mg/kg). For children between 1 and 4 months, the main 1230 contributors to manganese exposures were first infant form ulae (74%) and infant cereals (14%). 1231 Between 5 and 6 months, main contributors were follow -on formulae (21%) and infant cereals (15%). 1232 Between 7 and 12 months, main contributors were meat/vegetables and fish/vegetables jars (16%), 1233 infant cereals (13%) and fruits (11%). Between 13 and 36 months, main contributors were vegetables 1234 (14%), fruits (12%) and pasta (10%). It was estimated that the manganese mean exposures varied from 1235 0.126 to 0.653 mg/day according to the age group. Considering the 90th percentile, the manganese 1236 mean exposures varied from 0.348 to 1.26 mg /day according to the age group. 1237 Metallic food contact materials 1238 Manganese is used in steel and other alloys (Saric, 1986). 1239 Other food contact materials 1240 Manganese is used in the manufacture of glass to bleach out the colour of any iron present (Saric, 1241 1986). Manganese is used in pigments, glazes, and other products. 1242 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 44/134 Release 1243 Release of manganese from six types of stainless steels containing 0.21 -2.0 wt % manganese was 1244 examined in drinking water and in waters with 500 mg/L chloride or 3 mg/L \"free\" chlorine. The 1245 release manganese was below 0.002 mg/L in all tests (Lewus et al., 1998). 1246 Safety aspects 1247 - The JECFA has not evaluated manganese. 1248 - SCF (1993) recommends 1-10 mg/day as the acceptable range of intake. 1249 - SCF (1996) recommends a maximum limit of 0.5 mg/L for manganese in natural mineral 1250 waters. 1251 - In its 2001 recommendation, the AFSSA (France) set a safety limit of 10 mg/day (AFSSA - 1252 CNERNA -CNRS, 2001). In the total infant study, a security upper limit of 2 mg/day (fixed by the institute 1253 of medicine) was retained by ANSES for the 1 -3 years old infant (ANSES, 2016). 1254 - The Belgian Royal Decree of 30 May 2021 sets the maximum authorised intake via food 1255 supplements at 1 mg/day (RDI - Recommended Daily Intake). 1256 - WHO (2003) derived a limit of 0.06 mg/kg body weight/day (3.6 mg/day) within the drinking- 1257 water guidelines. This limit was derived from the average nutritional intake of mangan ese for an adult 1258 of 11 mg/day and an uncertainty factor of 3 (for the possible higher bio -availability of manganese in 1259 water) and resulted in a guidance value of 0.4 mg/L. However, in the 2011 revision of the guidelines, 1260 the WHO stated that this \"health -based value is well above concentrations of manganese normally 1261 found in drinking-water, it is not considered necessary to derive a formal guideline value\" (WHO, 2011, 1262 2017). 1263 - Both SCF (2000) and EFSA (2006) concluded that an upper level of manganese canno t be set 1264 due to the limitations of the human data and the non -availability of NOAELs for critical endpoints from 1265 animal studies, thereby producing a considerable degree of uncertainty. To date, the lowest -adverse - 1266 effect -levels (LOAELs) following oral administration observed are 0.28 mg/kg body weight/day in 1267 growing male rats and 0.36 body in female rats (SCF, 2000; EFSA, 2006). 1268 - Manganese is an essential trace element that plays a role in bone mineralisation, protein 1269 and energy met abolism, metabolic regulation, cellular protection from damaging free radicals, and 1270 the formation of glycosaminoglycans (ATSDR, 2008). Although manganese is an essential nutrient, 1271 exposure to high levels via inhalation or ingestion may cause some adverse health effects (ATSDR, 1272 2008). Excess of manganese affects the central nervous system and neurological effects have been 1273 observed in cases of occupational exposure. No problems have been reported in connection with 1274 dietary intake of manganese, since manganese is considered one of the least toxic metals. Consistent 1275 with its role as an essential element, manganese and its inorganic compounds have a relatively low 1276 order of acute toxicity (Beliles, 1994). However, absorption is increased in individuals with iron 1277 deficiency (Beliles, 1994). In humans, the degree of manganese absorption from the gastrointestinal 1278 system is generally low, in the order of 3% (Beliles, 1994). 1279 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 45/134 - The EVM could not derive an upper intake limit (EVM, 2003). However, guidance levels 1280 where no adverse effects are expected were derived using two retrospective studies. In these studies, 1281 the cohorts were exposed to either two or three different concentrations, respectively, of manganese 1282 in drinking water. The study using three different manganese concentrations found significant 1283 neurological effects and symptoms in the highest exposure group. Based on the NOAEL for these 1284 effects, the EVM derived a guidance level for older people of 0.15 mg/kg body weight/day (9 mg/day). 1285 No significant effects we re observed at either concentration in the second study. Hence, the EVM 1286 derived a guidance level for the general population of 0.2 mg/kg body weight/day (12 mg/day) using 1287 the higher concentration. 1288 - ICH Q3D: Manganese is one of some elemental impurities for which PDEs have not been 1289 established due to their low inherent toxicity and/or differences in regional regulations are not 1290 addressed in this ICH guideline. If these elemental impurities are present or included in the drug 1291 product they are addressed by other guidelines and/or regional regulations and practices that may be 1292 applicable for particular elements. 1293 - In the ANSES opinion (2018) related to the maximal safety value of manganese in drinking 1294 water, the toxicological reference value (TRV) of 55 g/k g body weight./day established by the 1295 national public health institute of Qu\u00e9bec was selected (Valcke et al. 2018). This TRV was derived using 1296 a LOAEL of 25 mg/kg b.w./day based on neurological effects observed in rats during development after 1297 post -natal e xposure (Kern et al., 2010 and 2011, Beaudin et al., 2013 and 2015). 1298 Conclusions and recommendations 1299 \"the SRL at The SRL is based on the toxicological reference value of 55 g/kg b.w. /day established by the national 1301 public health institute of Qu\u00e9bec and since oral intake data from multiple European countries are not 1302 available, an allowance of 20% for food contact materials is applied. Since the endpoint for the 1303 calculation of this reference value was based on neurolog ical effects observed during development 1304 after post -natal exposure, the recommended SRL is calculated considering toddlers as target 1305 population. Based on the food consumption values adopted by EFSA (2016), a toddler consumes 20 g 1306 of foodstuffs (other than drinks and food specially intended for infants and toddlers) per kg body 1307 weight per day. Consequently , the SRL for manganese is set at 0.55 mg/kg. 1308 Particularly for materials and articles intended for contact with milk, milk products and other non - 1309 alcoholic drinks as well as any food especially intended for infants and toddlers the most conservative 1310 consumption of 150 mg/kg body weight per day should be used and an SRL of 0.07 mg/kg food applies. 1311 References 1312 AFSSA-CNERNA -CNRS (2001).

Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on earth; it is found only in various oxidation 1382 states in minerals. As free element, it is a hard silvery -grey metal with a density of 10.2 g/cm3 (at room 1383 temperature). Molybdenum is a trace element essential for nearly all organisms and forms the 1384 catalytic centre of a large variety of enzymes such It is found ubiquitously in animals and plants. 1386 The human body contains approximately 9 mg of Mo (Lide, 2006). 1387 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 48/134 Sources and levels of intake 1388 Some of the main natural sources of molybdenum are liver, peas, beans, spinach, wheat germ (Emsley, 1389 2001), and dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale. 1390 The EFSA estimated oral intake for adults from food up to 500 g/day, andfor children age 1 -3 years 1391 old, up to 89 g/day (EFSA, 2009). The 2006 British total diet study estimated the mean and high -level 1392 intake for adults at 96.6 -98.4 g/person/day and 181.8 -184.8 g/person/day, as calculated using a 1393 bodyweight of 60 kg and from the mean (1.61 exposures, respectively (Rose et al., 2010). ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 93.9 1395 g/person/day in adults and the 95th percentile mg/person/day. 1396 Metallic food contact materials 1397 Molybdenum is used as an alloying addition in stainless steels that increases resistance to both 1398 uniform and local (pitting and crevice) corrosion. The use of molybdenum- containing steel may be 1399 required where contact is expected with highly corrosive liquids, like fruit juice, vinegar, wine and 1400 carbonated beverages (Mason, 1948). The most commonly used molyb denum -containing material for 1401 food contact applications is stainless steel 316 (2 -2.5% Mo in an iron -alloy) and its derivatives, but 1402 steels with higher or lower molybdenum percentages are used as well (Euro Inox, 2006). Hastelloy C - 1403 276 (a highly corrosion resistant Ni -Cr-Mo-Fe alloy) has been used for coffee flash driers. While Inconel 1404 and Hastelloy B & C have been used for the following food applications: fruit juice and syrups, pectin, 1405 and carbonated beverages 1406 (Mason, 1948), stainless steel grade 316 (2 -2.5% Mo) articles are also used for these food contact 1407 applications, as they are highly resistant and do not corrode, even at high temperatures.. Molybdenum 1408 is also an alloying element in nickel -based alloys used in food contact materials. 1409 Other food contact materials 1410 Molybdenum oxides are a constituent of pigments commonly used in ceramics used for food contact. 1411 Release 1412 Stainless steel grade 316L exposed to 5g/L citric acid for 2 hour at 70 \u00b0C followed by 10 days at 40 \u00b0C 1413 g/cm2 of molybdenum (i.e. 0.012 et exposed to 1% lactic acid or 0.01% HCl for 1 week at acid and 0.01% HCl 1416 solutions is comparable to that of 5 g/L citric acid (i.e. pH of 2.4). 1417 Safety aspects 1418 -- SCF (2000) and EFSA (2006) laid down an upper limit for molybdenum of 0.6 mg/day. This 1419 limit was based on an uncertainty factor of 100 using a NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg body weight/day from a 1420 9-week study in rats (incorporating an uncertainty factor of 10 for the additive effect of Cu deficiency 1421 in metabolism and an uncertainty factor of 10 for the eff ects on human reproduction). Furthermore, 1422 for children aged 1 -3 years an upper limit of 0.1 mg/day was extrapolated from the adult upper limit 1423 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 49/134 due to adverse effects on growth seen in young rats. EFSA (2009) confirmed these derived upper limits 1424 in an opini on of the ANS Panel. 1425 -- The EVM assessed molybdenum and determined that there was insufficient data to derive a 1426 safe upper level (EVM, 2003). One study reported that intakes of 1 mg/person/day and above could 1427 be associated with gout -like symptoms. However , the intake of molybdenum in the UK diet (maximum 1428 0.23 mg/person/day) was not expected to present a risk. 1429 -- Molybdenum is used in the synthesis of pharmaceutical substances (Mo combinations such as 1430 Bi-Mo, Fe -Mo, molybdenum oxide and Mo -complexes, are be ing used as catalysts in organic synthesis) 1431 and is included in the ICH Q3D. That Guideline classifies molybdenum in Class 3, metals of relatively 1432 low toxicity. That Guideline sets an oral Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) of 3400 g Mo/day for a 50 1433 kg individ ual, based on a NOAEL of 17 mg Mo/kg/day from a 90 -day toxicity study in the rat with 1434 dietary sodium molybdate dehydrate (Murray et al., 2014); bodyweight of 50 kg and a safety factor of 1435 250. 1436 Conclusions and recommendations 1437 \"the SRL is set at 0.12 mg/kg\" 1438 The SRL is calculated from the upper limit derived by EFSA (2006, 2009) of 0.6 mg/day, which agrees 1439 with the tolerable daily intake (oral exposure) of 10 \u00b5g/kg bw/day reported by RIVM (2001). 1440 Intake data from multiple European countries was provided by the EFSA (2009). However, the data 1441 used by the EFSA in 2009 was brought forward from earlier SCF opinions and contained data 1442 originating from the 1980s. 1443 Since newer intake data was only available from two European countries, the default allowance of 1444 20% for exposure to food contact materials and articles made from metals and alloys was applied to 1445 the upper limit of 0.6 mg/day. Consequently, assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1446 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or pr epared with food contact materials made from 1447 metals and alloys, the SRL for molybdenum is set at 0.12 mg/kg. 1448 Children are not considered as a vulnerable sub- population because of the negligible exposure of 1449 children to food contact materials and articles co ntaining molybdenum (Foster et al., 2010). 1450 References 1451 ANSES (2011).

Nickel is the 24th most abundant element and, in the environment, 1496 nickel is found primarily as oxides or sulphides (ATSDR, 2005). There has been a growing interest in 1497 the possible effects of nickel in foodstuffs, i.e. a possible worsening of nickel -related dermatitis. Nickel 1498 is an essential micronutrient for higher plants and some animal species but there are no data proving 1499 that it is essential for h umans (EFSA 2015). 1500 Sources and levels of intake 1501 In a monitoring program initiated in 1990 in Denmark, nickel was found in small quantities in many 1502 foodstuffs (0.001-0.01 mg/kg) and in higher concentrations in foodstuffs such as grains, nuts, cocoa 1503 product s and seeds (up to 0.8 mg/kg) (National Food Agency of Denmark, 1995). At FoodEx level 1, 1504 high mean levels of Ni were reported for 'Legumes, nuts and oilseeds' ( c.a. 2 mg/kg), certain types of 1505 chocolate (cocoa) products (3.8 mg/kg), and 'Cocoa beans and coa products' (9.5 mg/kg) (EFSA , 1506 2015). 1507 In the diet it is found as complex bound Ni2+-ions. The British total diet study (2006) estimated mean 1508 and high nickel intake levels for adults to be 0.09 -0.1 the 2014 UK Total Diet 1510 Study (FSA, 2019) the highest total mean and 97.5th percentile nickel exposures were in the 1.5 to 3 1511 years age class and were 4.4 -5.2 g/kg bw/day and 7.1 -8.1 g/kg bw/d ay, respectively. elder 1512 children, adolescents and adults the 97.5th percentile nickel exposures were in the range of 3.2 -7.3 1513 g/kg bw/day. 1514 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily g/kg body weight/day in adults and 3.83 g/kg 1515 body weight/day i n children. In the total infant study, these mean exposures were used (ANSES, 2016) . 1516 Exposure \u00b5g/kg bw/d for adults and children, respectively. 1517 For these populations, nickel exceedance in food (naturally occurring in food) was observed (Sirot et 1518 al., 2018) . 1519 EFSA (2015) estimated chronic dietary exposure to Ni combining food mean occurrence data with food 1520 consumption data at the individual level. Mean chronic dietary exposure to nickel, across the different 1521 dietary s urveys and age classes, ranged from 2.0 (minimum lower bound (LB), 'Elderly') to 13.1 g/kg 1522 body weight (b.w.) upper bound (UB), 'Toddlers'). The 95th percentile dietary 1523 LB, b.w. p er day (maximum UB, 1524 'Toddlers'). In the update of its risk assessment EFSA (2020) confirmed these values on a slightly higher 1525 level. The exposure in the update ranged from 1.57 (minimum mean lower bound (LB), 'Elderly') to 1526 14.6 g/kg body weight (b.w.) per mean upper bound (UB), 'Toddlers'). The 95th 1527 percentile dietary exposure LB, 24.8 g/kg b.w. per day 1528 (maximum UB, 'Toddlers'). The highest exposure was found for toddlers and other children. 1529 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 52/134 Metallic fo od contact materials 1530 85% of the world -wide production of nickel is used for the manufacturing of alloys, 9% for plating and 1531 6% for other uses (e.g. batteries) (Nickel Institute, 2011). There are at least 3,000 different alloys 1532 containing nickel. The major use of nickel is in the production of high -quality, corrosion resistant alloys 1533 with iron, copper, aluminium, chromium, zinc and molybdenum. Most nickel -containing food contact 1534 materials are stainless steels. 1535 Nickel -containing stainless steels (see Chapter 2, Stainless steels) are important food contact materials 1536 used for transport , e.g. in milk trucks, for processing equipment , e.g. in the dairy and chocolate 1537 industry, in processing of fruit such as apples, grapes, oranges and tomatoes, for containers such as 1538 wine tanks, for brew kettles and beer kegs, for processing of dry foods such as cereals, flour and sugar, 1539 for utensils such as blenders and bread -dough mixers, in slaughterhouses, in fish processing, for nearly 1540 all of the equipment in professional kitch ens such as restaurants and hospitals, for electric kettles, 1541 cookware and kitchen appliances of all kinds such as sinks and drains, for bowls, knives, spoons and 1542 forks ). 1543 Other nickel -containing food contact materials include German silver (also known as ni ckel silver and 1544 Maillechort), which is used for cutlery and as a base for silverware; and nickel bronze (also known as 1545 Dairy bronze and Thai bronze), which is used for cutlery and dairy equipment (see Chapter 2, Alloys). 1546 Nickel -plated items are less durabl e, less corrosion -resistant than stainless steel and are therefore not 1547 commonly used for articles in contact with food and drink. For chromium- plated objects, the materials 1548 are consecutively given a copper, nickel and then a chromium layer. Typical food co ntact materials 1549 and articles are kitchen utensils and nickel -plated heating coils in electric kettles.The latter are now 1550 rare; concealed (stainless steel) heating coils make de -scaling of kettles much easier. 1551 Other food contact materials 1552 Nickelous oxide, N iO, is used in the production of enamel frits and ceramic glazes, and in glass 1553 manufacture (Beliles, 1994). Basic nickel carbonate is used in colouring ceramics and glazes (Beliles, 1554 1994). 1555 Release 1556 A study comparing foods prepared in different stainless steel and glass pans found a higher nickel 1557 content in the stainless -steel-cooked foods. However, the additional contribution from the stainless 1558 steel represented only a minor fraction of the nickel content in the foods (Accominotti, 1998). In a 1559 similar study, acidic foods such as rhubarb cooked in new stainless steel pans only showed significant 1560 pick- up of nickel during the first cooking operation (Flint, 1997). Using boiling 5% acetic acid as a 1561 simulant for 5 minutes in stainless steel pans, nickel release ra nged between 0.08 and 0.21 mg/kg 1562 (Kuligowski, 1992). A survey of teapots showed nickel release between 1.2 mg/L and 35 mg/L using a 1563 citric acid solution (1 g/L) as a simulant and a contact time of 30 min. (Bolle, 2011). For the years 2012 1564 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 53/134 to 2018, RASFF sh ows 145 notifications for nickel release. Release value up to 1634.9 mg/kg was 1565 reported in 2014 for a bottle stopper5. 1566 Safety aspects 1567 -- JECFA has not evaluated nickel. 1568 -- In 2008, AFSSA set a tolerable daily intake at 22 g/kg bw/d, based on a 2 -generations rat 1569 study. 1570 -- EFSA (2005) could not derive a tolerable upper intake level for nickel in the evaluation of 1571 safety of fortified foods and food supplements due to the absence of adequate dose-response data 1572 for dermal reactions in nickel -sensitised subjects. 1573 -- EFSA (2015) (updated in 2018): The CONTAM Panel identified reproductive and 1574 developmental toxicity as the critical effect for the risk characterization of chronic oral exposure to Ni. 1575 The Panel derived a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 2.8 g Ni/kg b.w. /day 0.28 mg 1576 Ni/kg b.w. /day as calculated from the dose response analysis of the incidence of post -implantation 1577 fetal loss in rats, applying the default uncertainty factor of 100 to allow for interspecies differences 1578 and human variability. 1579 -- The Bf R (Tietz et al, 2018) reported a refinement of the modelling performed by EFSA (2015) 1580 using a nested data approach, which includes litter effects and outlier treatment. The modelling 1581 procedure used was in accordance with the BMD bw/day derived was in accordance with conclusions from other studies. 1583 -- EFSA (2020) updated the previous Scientific Opinion (EFSA, 2015), taking into account new 1584 occurrence data, the updated benchmark dose (BMD) Guidance and any newly available scientific 1585 information. The critical effect for chronic exposure was confirmed to be post implantation loss and 1586 perinatal death of fetusses (as used in the previous Opinions). The Panel derived a TDI of 13 g Ni/kg 1587 b.w. of 1.3 mg Ni/kg b.w. /day, applying the default uncertainty factor of 100 to 1588 account for interspecies differences and human variability. 1589 -- The absorption and retention of nickel in the gastrointestinal tract is influenced by fasting and 1590 food intak e. Food intake and gastric emptying are of substantial significance for the bio availability of 1591 nickel from aqueous solutions. The absorption of free nickel ions released in the gastrointestinal tract 1592 may be 40 times higher than that of complex bound nickel from foodstuffs (Sunderman et al., 1989). 1593 The absorption of nickel from drinking- water is increased by fasting (Nielsen et al., 1999). Up to 10% 1594 of inorganic nickel compounds are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Norseth, 1986). Nickel 1595 intake via foodstuffs does not cause hazards for the majority of consumers. A subgroup of the 1596 population (approximately 10%, mainly women) has contact allergies to nickel. Sensitisation against 1597 nickel is caused by exposure through skin or by inhalation (EFSA, 2015). However, some patients with 1598 5 Report by the Slovenian CD- P-MCA delegation (January 2019) from RASFF Notifications for nickel 2012- 2018. DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 54/134 certain types of nickel dermatitis may get a flare -up of eczema through oral ingestion of even small 1599 amounts of nickel, e.g. from foodstuffs rich in nickel or foodstuffs or drinks contaminated by nickel - 1600 containing materials (Veien, 1989; Veien and Menn\u00e9, 1990). 1601 TDI 0.012 mg/kg body weight/day (0.7 mg/day) from human 1602 data. This value was derived from the LOAEL of 0.012 mg/kg body weight/day from an oral provocation 1603 study using fasting individuals w ith an allergy against nickel (Nielsen, 1999). Because the LOAEL was 1604 based on a highly susceptible population, the WHO stated that no additional uncertainty factor was 1605 necessary. 1606 -- The EVM also assessed nickel and while they could not derive a safe upper level, they 1607 determined that intakes of 0.0043 mg/kg body weight/ day would not be expected to affect non - 1608 sensitised individuals (EVM, 2003). This guidance is based on a LOAEL for increased perinatal mortality 1609 in a multi -generation rat study of 1.3 mg/kg b .w. /day and using uncertainty factors of 10 for inter - 1610 species variation, 10 for intra -species variation and 3 for extrapolation of a LOAEL to a NOAEL. 1611 -- In their 2008 statement, the COT considered that UK dietary exposures above the EVM 1612 guidance level but within the WHO TDI of 0.012 mg/kg b .w. /day were unlikely to be of toxicological 1613 concern, though they noted that nickel may exacerbate contact dermatitis/eczema in presensitised 1614 individuals (COT, 2008). The COT had previously concluded that pre-school ch ildren (who have the 1615 highest exposures) are less likely than adults to be sensitised and would therefore not be considered 1616 to be a sensitive sub -group. 1617 -- According to ICH Q3D, the oral nickel PDE is 220 \u00b5g/day. Nickel as Ni -Al alloys is being used as 1618 catalyst in hydrogenation reactions. 1619 Conclusions and recommendations 1620 \"the SRL for nickel is set at 0.14 mg/kg\" 1621 Two very close and conservative TDI values, the TDI of 0.013 mg/kg body weight/day (0.7 mg/day), which are based on human data from nickel - 1623 sensitised individuals, have been reported in literature. The WHO TDI was used to derive the SRL. 1624 The default allowance of 20% for exposure through food contact materials and articles made from 1625 metals and alloys w as applied to the TDI. Assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg 1626 of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals 1627 and alloys, the SRL is set at 0.14 mg/kg. 1628 Care has to be taken to ensure th at nickel -plated articles for direct contact with foodstuffs comply 1629 with the SRL for nickel. 1630 References Vallon, J.J., (1998).

Silver alloyed containing a 1711 minimum of 92.5% by we ight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper is known as 1712 sterling silver (Beliles, 1994). 1713 Sources and levels of intake 1714 Silver may be ingested via consumption of marine organisms containing low concentrations, and in 1715 small amounts released from dental fillings (Fowler and Nordberg, 1986). Silver salts are used in some 1716 countries to disinfect drinking water because of their germicidal properties (Beliles, 1994; Fowler and 1717 Nordberg, 1986). Silver is also used as a colouring agent for dec orations in confectionery and in 1718 alcoholic beverages. 1719 Based on actual levels of silver in drinking water that were generally below 0.005 mg/L (WHO, 1993), 1720 the WHO estimated an intake about 0.007 mg/day (0.12 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day). 1721 ANSES (2011) estima ted mean daily intake between 1.29 and 2.65 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day (according 1722 to lower bound or upper bound assumptions) for adults and between 1.60 and 3.47 \u00b5g/kg body 1723 weight/day for children. 1724 In a recent study on infants and toddlers (Sirot et al., 2018; ANSES, 2016), the daily intake was 1725 estimated to be negligible (0 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day) in a lower bound calculation both for mean and 1726 90th percentile. For upper bound, a daily intake of 2.10 - 4.23 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day ght/day (90th percentile) were calculated. 1728 It has to be noted that though the cited studies are total diet studies, in course of which the samples 1729 were prepared 'as consumed', usage of silver tableware and cutlery were not covered by the study 1730 design. Henc e, the actual daily intake for consumers using these articles on a daily basis could be 1731 higher. 1732 Metallic food contact materials 1733 Silver is used in the production of cutlery and tableware (Fowler and Nordberg, 1986). 1734 Attention should be paid to the European standards EN ISO 8442 -2 (AFNOR, 1997) and EN ISO 8442-3 1735 (AFNOR, 1997) that apply to silver -plated nickel silver, or silver -plated stainless steel cutlery and to 1736 silver -coated brass, copper, nickel -silver, pewter and stainless steel hollow -ware and attachments 1737 thereto, respectively. 1738 Other food contact materials 1739 No information is available. 1740 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 58/134 Release 1741 The information on release of silver is limited. Pure silver is a moderately soft metal (Beliles, 1994). 1742 Chemically, silver is the most reactive of t he noble metals, but it does not readily oxidise; instead it 1743 \"tarnishes\" by combining with sulphur or H2S. Nitric or sulphuric acids can oxidise silver to the uni - 1744 positive ion, the form in which it exists in most of its compounds (Beliles, 1994). 1745 Safety aspects 1746 - JECFA (1978) has reviewed the existing toxicological data (WHO, 1977) and concluded that \"no 1747 evaluation could be made\" due to insufficient data. . 1748 - Up to 10 -20% of silver salts may be absorbed following ingestion (Fowler and Nordberg, 1986). T he 1749 biological half -life of silver ranges from a few days for animals up to about 50 days in the human liver 1750 (Fowler and Nordberg, 1986). Water -soluble silver compounds, such as silver nitrate, have a local 1751 corrosive effect and may cause fatal poisoning if ingested accidentally. Repeated exposure to silver 1752 may produce anaemia, cardiac enlargement, growth retardation and degenerative changes in the liver 1753 (Fowler and Nordberg, 1986). 1754 - According to EFSA (2016), \"ionic silver is non-mutagenic in bacteria but genotoxic and clastogenic in 1755 mammalian cells in vitro [...]. No information is available on the genotoxic potential of ionic silver in 1756 vivo.\" 1757 - Acute human toxicity from silver seems to be related to stimulation followed by depression of 1758 structures in the bra in stem (WHO, 1977). Symptoms are rise in blood pressure, haemorrhagic 1759 gastroenteritis and shock. 10 g of silver nitrate taken orally are considered to be a lethal dose to man, 1760 (WHO , 1977). Some silver compounds such as silver oxide and silver nitrate are irritating, and exposure 1761 is associated with nose -bleeds and abdominal cramps (Beliles, 1994). High intake of silver, whether as 1762 metal or in ionic form can lead to renal and pulmonary lesions and argyria or argyrosis. 1763 - EFSA (2016) summarised the acute tox icity in animals as follows: According to WHO (1977), the LD50 1764 (mice) is 50 mg/kg body weight as silver nitrate (corresponding to 32 mg ionic silver/kg body weight). 1765 According to Tamimi et al. (1998), the LD50 in rats and rabbits is 428 and 1261 mg silver nitrate/kg 1766 body weight, respectively, corresponding to 280 and 794 mg ionic silver/kg body weight, respectively) 1767 - There are only few studies on subchronic or chronic exposure towards silver. In these, effects on the 1768 liver, body weight, immune system as we ll as developmental toxicity were observed - though data 1769 were not always consistent (especially for immune toxicity). The lowest NOAEL (0.26 mg ionic silver/kg 1770 body weight/day) was identified for reproduction toxicity observed in a one generation study, wh ere 1771 silver acetate was orally ingested via drinking water (Sprando et al., 2017). The NOAEL is based on 1772 reduced body weight gain of the pubs and reduced number of implants and post implantation loss. 1773 However, it should be noted, that the selection of the N OAEL is questionable, because the reduced 1774 body weight was only observed in one dose group (middle dose: 2.6 mg/kg body weight/day), not 1775 dose dependent, and could be explained by a slightly increased number of pups. Reduced number of 1776 implants and post impla ntation loss were only observed in the high dose group (26 mg/kg body 1777 weight/day). Hence it would be possible to identify this dose as LOAEL, resulting in a NOAEL of 2.6 mg 1778 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 59/134 ionic silver/kg body weight/day. However, in accordance with EFSA (2016) it should be concluded, that 1779 the data are not robust enough for derivation of a health based guidance value. 1780 - In 1980, the EPA analysed and described a series of experiments, concluding that silver ion 1781 concentrations > 0.2 mg/L in drinking water had no harmful effect on laboratory animals that had 1782 been continuously ingesting them for 11 months (EPA, 1980). 1783 - EPA has established a chronic oral reference dose (RfD) for silver ingestion of 5 g/kg of body weight 1784 per day on a review of 70 cases of argyria by oral route, last updated in 1991 ( EPA 1991). This value is 1785 not adapted for risk assessment in food because of the lack of studies. 1786 - The WHO did not set any value for silver in the 4th edition of the \"Guidelines for drinking-water 1787 quality\", which is coherent with previous editions (WHO, 1993, 2008, 2011 & 2017). Using argyria 1788 (silver overload) (Gaul and Staud, 1935) as an endpoint, they derived a total lifetime oral intake where 1789 no effects are expected of about 10 g of silver (equal to 0.39 mg/person/day). 1790 - The EFSA has established a group restriction for substances containing silver at 0.05 mg/kg food. In 1791 their decision the EFSA considered the WHO \"Guidelines for drinking -water quality\" limit of 0.39 1792 mg/person/day and concluded that a restriction of 0.05 mg Ag/kg foo d would contribute about 12.5% 1793 of the human NOAEL (EFSA, 2005). 1794 - Remark: food contact materials containing nanoscale silver have not been considered and need to 1795 be evaluated separately on a case -by-case basis. 1796 Conclusions and recommendations 1797 \"the SRL for silver is set at 0.08 mg/kg\" 1798 Given the lack of data and the lack of clarity associated with the WHO derived total lifetime oral intake 1799 of about 10 g, the intake data from ANSES (2011) were used to derive the SRL. Using the lower value 1800 of 1.29 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day (0.08 mg/day) and assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight 1801 consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials 1802 made from metals and alloys, the SRL is set at 0.08 mg/kg. Because the limit was derived from intake 1803 data , no allowance for metallic food contact materials was applied. 1804 Silver or silverplated cutlery, manufactured to be used for eating or serving (not for cooking) and not 1805 on a daily basis, should be labelled accordingly. When as sessing their compliance, a reduction factor 1806 of 5 may be applied to the specific release value, when justified (see Annex II of chapter 3). 1807 References 1808 AFNOR (1997) EN ISO 8442-3.

Combustion of fossil fuels releases small quantities of tin into the air (WHO, 1868 2005). Secondary tin sources are general tin-, lead- and copper -based alloys and, in particular, solder 1869 from electrical and electronic devices. Tin is recovered from tinplate manufac ture and from cans 1870 (Magos, 1986). 1871 Sources and levels of intake 1872 Inorganic tin is found in most foodstuffs; it may occur in a cationic form (stannous and 1873 compounds) or as inorganic anions (stannites or stannates). Levels are generally less than 1 mg/kg in 1874 unprocessed foodstuffs. Higher concentrations are found i n canned foodstuffs due to dissolution of 1875 the tinplate to form inorganic tin compounds or complexes (WHO, 2005). 1876 A normal diet without canned foodstuffs or beverages contains approximately 0.2 mg tin/day (WHO, 1877 2005). The total average dietary intake of ti n is 4 mg/day (Beliles, 1994). More recently, in the 2014 1878 British total diet study the highest total mean and 97.5th percentile exposures were in the 1.5 to 3 1879 years age class and were 95 - 96 g/kg b .w. /day and 300 g/kg b .w. /day, respectively. The highest 1880 contributing food group to total mean exposure was the 'canned vegetables' group with a mean 1881 exposure of 61 g/kg b .w. /day (FSA, 2014). 1882 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake as total tin at 3.9 \u00b5g/person/day in adults and 7.3 1883 \u00b5g/person/day in childr en. Highest concentrations were measured in stewed fruits (8.55 mg/kg) and 1884 cheese (1.94 mg/kg). 1885 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 62/134 Metallic food contact materials 1886 At present, the major source of tin in the diet is from food contact materials; especially the release 1887 from tin cans to acidic foodstuffs (WHO, 2005). Tin cans are actually steel cans with a thin coating of 1888 metallic tin (tinplate) (Beliles, 1994). There is often an internal resin-based coating on the tinplate. 1889 Tinplate is mainly used in cans and closures and lids for glass bottles and jars. Tin is also found in 1890 pewter. Tin is used in alloys, e.g. with copper for conversion into bronze and with zinc for galvanisation 1891 (Beliles, 1994). Tin is also used to coat kitchen utensils. 1892 While the use of tin in cans has decreased somewhat in recent years in the USA, tinplate remains the 1893 largest tin use sector in the EU, where quantities employed have been stable for several years. There 1894 is significant growth in tinplate use in other regions. 1895 Other food contact materials 1896 Inorganic tin compoun ds are used as pigments in the ceramic industry (Magos, 1986). 1897 Tin(IV) oxide is used both as an opacifier and as a constituent of coloured pigments in high-quality 1898 tableware, e.g. bone china and porcelain products. Thin tin(IV) oxide films on glass can also be used 1899 to strengthen and provide scratch -resistance to beer glasses, milk bottles, etc. 1900 Release 1901 Tin is amphoteric, reacting with both strong acids and bases, but is relatively non -reactive with nearly 1902 neutral solutions (Beliles, 1994). The presenc e of oxygen greatly accelerates reactivity in solution 1903 (Beliles, 1994). 1904 Tinplate used in food containers is only slowly oxidised. The tin content in foodstuffs depends on: 1905 - whether the tin cans are lacquered; 1906 - the presence of any oxidising agents or corrosion accelerators (e.g. nitrate); 1907 - the acidity of the product in the tin can; 1908 - how long, and at what temperature, the tin cans are stored before being opened; 1909 - the length of time the product is kept in the tin can after it has been opened. 1910 Oxidation of tinplate, followed by the release of tin ions into the foodstuff is known as a \"sacrificial 1911 anode effect\", a physiochemical mechanism that protects the underlying steel from corrosion. The 1912 dissolution of tin protects the can from possible perfo ration and protects the contents from 1913 degradation (changes in colour and flavour) during heat sterilisation and storage. 1914 The concentration of tin in foodstuffs stored in unlacquered cans may exceed 100 mg/kg, whereas 1915 foodstuffs stored in lacquered cans sh ow tin levels generally below 25 mg/kg (WHO, 2005). Storing 1916 foodstuffs in opened unlacquered cans results in substantial increases in the tin concentration in the 1917 foodstuffs (WHO, 2005). Fruits and vegetables consumed from unlacquered cans make up only a s mall 1918 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 63/134 percentage of dietary intake (by weight of total food intake), but their contribution to dietary tin intake 1919 amounts to 85%. The thickness of the lacquer coating greatly influences the performance of the 1920 lacquered food can (WHO, 2005). 1921 An oxide film fo rms on metallic tin on exposure to air, whether in the pure form or as an alloy, and 1922 not just on dipped and electroplated tin. The film is fairly stable and provides a barrier to further 1923 oxidation. At pH values between 3 and 10 and in the absence of complexing agents, the oxide barrier 1924 protects the metal from the food. Outside this pH range, however, corrosion of the tin occurs (Murphy 1925 and Amberg- Muller, 1996). 1926 Pewter may contain lead as a contaminant, which can also be released. Antique pewter may have 1927 been manufactured using lead -containing alloys, but this is not the case with modern pewter. Today, 1928 maximum levels of lead are specified for lead-containing pewter. 1929 Safety aspects 1930 - JECFA (1989) established in 1988 a PTWI at 14 mg/kg body weight/week inclu ding tin from food 1931 additives. The JECFA also states that \"tin levels should be as low as practicable because of possibility 1932 of gastric irritation\". In 2005, the JECFA maintained the PTWI of 14 mg/kg/week (JECFA 2005). 1933 - WHO (2017) has concluded that, becau se of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, a tentative guideline 1934 value could be derived three orders of magnitude higher than the normal tin concentration in drinking- 1935 water. For this reason the establishment of a numerical guideline value for inorganic tin w as deemed 1936 not necessary. 1937 - Codex Standard 193 -1995 fixed a maximum limit of 250 mg/kg for tin in canned foods and a 1938 maximum level of 150 mg/kg for tin in canned beverages. 1939 - According to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Co uncil of 16 1940 December 2008 on food additives, stannous chloride is authorised as a food additive for canned and 1941 bottled asparagus (only white asparagus) up to 25 mg/kg (as tin). 1942 - There are no indications of chronic tin toxicity in humans (WHO, 2005). Inorganic tin compounds, 1943 especially the environmentally dominant tetravalent tins, are poorly absorbed from the 1944 gastrointestinal tract (Magos, 1986). Tin compounds act as an irritant for the gastrointestinal tract 1945 mucosa, causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fa tigue and headache (WHO, 2005). There is only a 1946 limited number of cases indicating possible gastrointestinal irritation which have been reported 1947 following the consumption of canned fruit juices, tomatoes, cherries, asparagus, herrings and apricots. 1948 The exa ct concentrations of tin were unknown in these cases of assumed acute poisoning, but were 1949 probably in the range of 300 -500 mg/kg (WHO, 1980). Earlier studies suggest that tin might interfere 1950 with iron absorption and haemoglobin formation. Tin also has an i nhibitory effect on copper, zinc and 1951 calcium absorption (WHO, 2005). Chronic exposure to high levels of tin may result in growth 1952 depression and altered immune function, possibly due to interactions between tin and zinc or 1953 selenium (WHO, 2005). 1954 - EFSA (200 6) quoted a study recording a decrease in zinc assimilation following absorption of 50 1955 mg/day of SnCl 2. The EFSA assessed tin in 2005, but considered the available data insufficient to derive 1956 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 64/134 a tolerable upper intake level (EFSA, 2005). They noted that cur rent daily intakes in the EU, ranging up 1957 to 6 mg/day in the UK, appears to be well below levels associated with adverse effects. 1958 - In their assessment, the EVM could not establish a safe upper level, but considered that 0.22 mg/kg 1959 body weight/day (13.2 mg/ day) would not be expected to produce adverse effects in humans (EVM, 1960 2003). This was based on a NOAEL for liver cell changes and anaemia of 22 -33 mg/kg body weight/day 1961 from a sub -chronic study in rats with uncertainty factors of 10 for inter-species and 1 0 for intra -species 1962 variation. 1963 - The COT, in their 2008 statement, considered that the PTWI is not directly applicable to long -term 1964 dietary exposure as it appears to be based on acute toxicity (COT, 2008). They used the EVMs 1965 assessment as a guidance level. 1966 - In 2010, the \"REACH Tin Metal Consortium\" conducted a 28 -day, repeated dose, oral toxicity study 1967 in rats with tin as powder. Multiple endpoints were investigated and no adverse effects have been 1968 detected even at the highest dose (1,000 mg/kg body weight /day). However, the study was considered 1969 inadequate because tin was administered in a powder form, which is not representative of human 1970 dietary exposure. 1971 - According to Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in 1972 foodst uffs, the maximum levels of tin (inorganic) have been set to: 1973 - 50 mg/kg for certain canned foods for babies and young children 1974 - 50 mg/kg canned dietary foods for special medical purposes for infants 1975 - 100 mg/kg for canned beverages, including fr uit juices and vegetable juices 1976 - 200 mg/kg for canned foods other than beverages 1977 Conclusions and recommendations 1978 \"the SRL for tin is set at 100 mg/kg\" 1979 Food contact with tin materials exposed to air should be avoided at low pH and high temperatures as 1980 the \"sacrificial effect\" afforded by sealed tin-plated cans is lost and the underlying steel is no longer 1981 protected. 1982 Consumers should be advised against storing food in opened tin -plated cans. 1983 In view of the observed acute effects (gastric irritation) the SRL for tin is set, in approximation with 1984 Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006, at 100 mg/kg. This limit does not apply to food contact applications 1985 that are covered by Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006. 1986 The lower limit for babies and young children w as not considered because exposure of children to tin 1987 from food contact applications that are not covered by Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 is negligible 1988 (Foster, 2010). 1989 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 65/134 References 1990 ANSES (2011).

World Health Organisation 2005. 2027 WHO (2017): Guidelines for drinking -water quality: fourth edition incorporating the Titanium (Ti) 2031 Titanium is the ninth most common element in the Earth's crust and occurs in a number of minerals 2032 (Beliles, 1994). Titanium is a silvery-grey metal resembling polished steel (Beliles, 1994). There is no 2033 evidence indicating that titanium is an essential element for man (Nordman and Berlin, 1986). 2034 Sources and levels of intake 2035 In the UK, the use of titanium dioxide is permitted, with no indications that it will align with the EU on 2036 this issue. The Food Standard Agency has decided to launch their own review of the safety of titanium 2037 dioxide as a food additive (COT, 2022). 2038 In EU , the t itanium dioxide was used as food additive (E 171) and is still used in toothpastes, 2039 sunscreens and pharmaceuticals. 2040 As of 2022, the use of E 171 tita nium dioxide as a food additive is banned in Europe. Titanium dioxide 2041 is not authorised in the food categories listed in Annex II (Part D and E) of Regulation (EC) No 2042 1333/2008 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2022/63. Until 7 August 2022, foods produced i n 2043 accordance with the rules applicable before 7 February 2022 may continue to be placed on the market. 2044 After that date, they may remain on the market until their date of minimum durability or 'use by' date 2045 (Regulation (EC) No 2022/63). 2046 The European Commiss ion \"shall, following consultation on the European Medicines Agency, review 2047 the necessity to maintain titanium dioxide (E 171) or to delete it from the Union list of food additives 2048 for the exclusive use as colour in medicinal products in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2049 1333/2008 within three years after the date of entering into force \" of Regulation (EC) No 2022/63. 2050 Metallic food contact materials 2051 Titanium is often used in the form of alloys, which are stronger and more resistant to corrosion th an 2052 the metal itself (Nordman and Berlin, 1986). However, its use in food contact materials is unknown. 2053 Titanium has been suggested for use with corrosive or delicate liquids such as dairy products, fruit 2054 juices and in the wine industry (Feliciani et al., 1 998). Titanium is also used in certain so -called 2055 \"stabilised\" forms of stainless steels, which in general contain less than 1% titanium. 2056 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 67/134 Other food contact materials 2057 The extreme whiteness and brightness of titanium dioxide has led to its extensive use as a white 2058 pigment in paints, lacquers, enamels, paper -coatings and plastics (Beliles, 1994; Nordman and Berlin, 2059 1986). Titanium compounds are also used as catalysts in the manufacture of plastics. 2060 Release 2061 Titanium seems to be practically inert, due to the phenomenon of passivation of the titanium surface 2062 by the formation of a molecular layer of TiO2. This layer, which is very adherent to the metallic 2063 substrate, is hardly removed even by aggressive 3% v/v acetic acid solution saturated with 18 -20% ch loride (Feliciani et al. , 1998). 2065 Safety aspects 2066 - Titanium dioxide was assessed by the JECFA in 1969 and an unlimited ADI was determined (JECFA, 2067 1970). 2068 - The estimated intake of titanium is 0.3 -1 mg/day (Beliles, 1994; Whitehead, 1991). 2069 - Titanium compou nds are generally considered to be poorly absorbed upon ingestion (Nordman and 2070 Berlin, 1986). Studies on titanium alloys used in implants and titanium compounds used in cosmetics 2071 and pharmaceuticals do not indicate any localised tissue effects (Nordman and Berlin, 1986). A distinct 2072 dichotomy exists between TiO2, the insoluble, unreactive non- metabolised form that is 2073 of toxicity, and the soluble, inorganic salts that metabolise normally with absorption, 2074 distribution, and excretion (Belil es, 1994). However, little information exists on how titanium acts as 2075 a toxic agent, and what does exist is of little or no value in understanding the toxic actions of titanium 2076 (Beliles, 1994). 2077 - EFSA (2021) provided an updated safety assessment of the fo od additive titanium dioxide (E 171) 2078 taking into account all new relevant data available to EFSA. Along with all the uncertainties, in 2079 particular the fact that genotoxicity concern could not be ruled out, the Panel concluded that E 171 2080 can no longer be con sidered as safe when used as a food additive. 2081 The 2021 opinion by EFSA applies only to E 171 as described in Commission Regulation (EU) No 2082 231/2012 as well as to E 171 specified in the 2019 opinion; while the titanium in metals and alloys as 2083 food contact materials seems to be practically inert, due to the phenomenon of passivation. 2084 Conclusions and recommendations 2085 \"it is appropriate not to set any SRL for titanium\" 2086 At the moment, it is appropriate not to set any SRL for titanium. However, the definition of appropriate 2087 measures related to titanium dioxide used in food contact materials and articles is under study. 2088 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 68/134 References 2089 Beliles, R.P.

VCH. 2116 (V) 2117 Vanadium is a white, shiny, soft, ductile metal. It is highly resistant to corrosion by alkali compounds 2118 as well as hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is to be found in some ores a nd it is mainly used in alloys. 2119 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 69/134 Sources and levels of intake 2120 Vanadium is mainly found in seafood and mushrooms, but also in many fruits and vegetables, albeit 2121 in very low quantities. 2122 In the USA, dietary intake was estimated in the range of 6 -18 g/day for adults (Pennington and Jones, 2123 1987). Results from a duplicate diet study in Spain estimated the dietary intake of vanadium equal to 2124 156 \u00b5g/day (Domingo et al., 2011). 2125 ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 52 \u00b5g/day (0.86 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day) i n adults and 2126 1.06 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day in children. 2127 Metallic food contact materials 2128 Vanadium can be used in alloys to manufacture tools such as knife blades. Vanadium steel is extremely 2129 well suited to the manufacture of tools, axes and knives, as well as spare parts for rotating machines. 2130 Adding vanadium to steel in proportions of approx. 1% produces a highly shock -resistant alloy. 2131 In France, MCDA n\u00b01 (V02 - 01/04/2017) on food contact suitability of metals and alloys specifies 2132 limits for vanadium . 2133 Other food contact materials 2134 Vanadium oxide is used in ceramic pigments. 2135 Release 2136 No information available. 2137 Safety aspects 2138 - The EVM (2003) has assessed vanadium but could not derive an upper limit. 2139 - The American Food and Nutrition Board (FNB, 2001) der ived an upper limit (UL) of 1.8 mg/day for 2140 vanadium. This value was derived from a LOAEL of 7.7 mg/kg body weight/day (460 mg/day) from a 2141 rat study, an average body weight of 68.5 kg and an uncertainty factor of 300. This upper limit was 2142 also adopted by Health Canada. However, Health Canada has stated: \"Although vanadium in food has 2143 not been shown to cause adverse effects in humans, there is no justification for adding vanadium to 2144 food and vanadium supplements should be used with caution. The UL is based on adverse effects in 2145 laboratory animals and this data could be used to set a UL for adults but not children and adolescents\" 2146 (Health Canada, 2017) . 2147 - EFSA (2006; 2009) reviewed the findings of FNB (2001). The absence of a NOAEL and limited dose - 2148 response dat a prevented the EFSA from deriving an upper limit. Furthermore, the EFSA noted that 2149 vanadium has been observed as having adverse effects on kidneys, spleen, lungs and blood pressure 2150 in animals. In addition, developmental toxicity has also been seen in the offspring of rats. However, it 2151 was noted that an exposure of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/day is at least three orders of magnitude below the 2152 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 70/134 dose which causes gastrointestinal effects in body -builders taking vanadium as supplements (EFSA, 2153 2006; 2009). According oral Vanadium PDE 120 recommendations for vanadium is set at 0.01 mg/kg\" 2157 It was decided to follow the opinion issued by the EFSA. Given the toxicity data and potential for 2158 adverse health effects, a n SRL determined using the FNB/Health Canada upper limit cannot be 2159 supported. Therefore, it was agreed to base the SRL on the EFSA exposure data. Using the lower 2160 estimated intake of 0.01 mg/day and assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of 2161 foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals 2162 and alloys, the SRL for vanadium is set at 0.01 mg/kg. Since the SRL has been derived from exposure 2163 data, the use of an allocation factor is not deemed nece ssary. 2164 References 2165 ANSES (2011).

Zinc is the 25 th most abundant element and is widely 2201 found in nature (Beliles, 1994). Zinc appears in the form of zinc ions or zinc salts. Galvanising, a process 2202 involving the coatin g of iron and steel with zinc to prevent corrosion, is the most important use of zinc 2203 (Beliles, 1994). Zinc protects iron from rusting because it is a stronger reducing agent (Beliles, 1994). 2204 Zinc is also used in fertilisers. 2205 Sources and levels of intake 2206 Zinc occurs in most foodstuffs and beverages (ATSDR, 2005). The main contributors to zinc intake are 2207 meats, especially organs, whole grain cereals and milk products including cheese. Oysters and peanuts 2208 may contain up to 100 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg zinc, resp ectively. 2209 In the 2014 British total diet study, the highest total mean and 97.5th percentile exposures were in 2210 the 1.5 to 3 years age class and were 320 g/kg bw/day and 530 g/kg bw/day, respectively. The 2211 highest contributing food groups to total mean ex posure were the 'miscellaneous cereals' and 'dairy 2212 products' a mean exposure of 51 g/kg bw/day. (FSA, 2014). More recently results from 2213 a duplicate diet study in Spain estimated the dietary intake of zinc equal to 6.8 mg/day (Domingo et 2214 al., 2 011). In Ireland the mean and 95th percentile intake from all sources including supplements were 2215 equal to 10.4 mg/day and 19.4 mg/day, respectively (IUNA, 2011). ANSES (2011) estimated for adults 2216 the mean daily intake at 7.9 mg/day and for the 95th percent ile at 13.3 mg/day. 2217 Metallic food contact materials 2218 Major uses of zinc are in the production of non -corrosive alloys, brass and in galvanised steel and iron 2219 products (Elinder, 1986). A common use of metallic zinc is to coat iron or other metals so that they do 2220 not rust or corrode (ATSDR, 2005). Metallic zinc is also mixed with other metals to form alloys such as 2221 brass and bronze (ATSDR, 2005). Galvanised products are widely used as household appliances 2222 (Elinder, 1986). Zinc may contain small amounts of more toxic metals, e.g. cadmium (0.01 -0.04%) and 2223 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 72/134 lead, as impurities (Elinder, 1986). The use of food contact materials made of zinc, zinc alloys or 2224 galvanised zinc is limited. 2225 Zinc-coated steels are used in silos for storing foodstuffs. 2226 Other food contac t materials 2227 Zinc sulfide is grey -white or yellow -white, and zinc oxide is white. Both of these salts are used to make 2228 white paints, ceramics, and several other products (ATSDR, 2005). 2229 Release 2230 Zinc is a relatively soft metal and has a strong tendency to react with inorganic compounds, e.g. to 2231 form oxides, as well as organic compounds (Elinder, 1986). Galvanised iron containers holding acidic 2232 drinks such as orange juice or alcoholic beverages have resulted in a number of reports of poisoning. 2233 Zinc is easily dissolved in dilute acids and by bases (Beliles, 1994). Zinc galvanised utensils may release 2234 zinc and cadmium. They can also release zinc hydrocarbonate in confined spaces when exposed to air 2235 and humidity. 2236 Data on the release of zinc from food contact ma terials and articles are scarce. One study, a survey of 2237 teapots, showed zinc release between 0.9 mg/L and 40 mg/L using a citric acid solution (1 g/L) as 2238 simulant and a contact time of 30 min. (Bolle et al., 2011). 2239 Safety aspects 2240 - JECFA (1982) establish ed a PMTDI of 0.3 -1 mg/kg body weight/day. 2241 - The required daily intake for adults is about 15 mg/day. However, the requirement varies with age 2242 (JECFA, 1982). 2243 - WHO (2017) stated that derivation of a health -based guideline value for drinking water was not 2244 required. However, drinking water containing levels above 3 mg/L may not be acceptable to 2245 consumers. 2246 - Zinc is one of the most ubiquitous of the essential trace metals (Florence and Batley, 1980). The 2247 absorption of ingested zinc is highly variable (10 -90%) (Elinder, 1986). Zinc is an essential element 2248 necessary for the functioning of a large number of met allo-enzymes (ATSDR, 2005; Beliles, 1994). Zinc 2249 acts to reduce the toxicity of cadmium and copper (Florence and Batley, 1980). Zinc may be a modifier 2250 of the carcinogenic response; zinc deficiency or excessively high levels of zinc may enhance 2251 susceptibilit y to carcinogenesis (Beliles, 1994). 2252 - In their assessment, the EVM (EVM, 2003) derived a safe upper level of 0.42 mg/kg body weight/day 2253 (25 mg/day) for supplemental zinc. This is based on a LOAEL of 50 mg/person/day roxide dismutase (eSOD) by zinc, associated with a mild copper deficiency. An 2255 uncertainty factor of 2 was used for LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation as the effect is a small inconsistent 2256 change in a biochemical parameter. Assuming a maximum intake of 17 mg/pers on/day from food a 2257 total intake of 0.7 mg/kg body weight/day would not be expected to result in any adverse effect. 2258 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 73/134 -SCF (2003) and EFSA (2006) interpreted, for the same endpoint (inhibition of eSOD), the value of 2259 50 mg/day as the NOAEL. Using an uncertain ty factor of 2 to account for the small number of subjects 2260 surveyed, the upper limit was set to 25 mg/day. Furthermore, for children aged 1 -3 years, an upper 2261 limit of 7 mg/day was extrapolated from the adult upper limit. 2262 - In the 2008 European Risk Assessm ent Report, the overall oral NOAEL of 50 mg/day was confirmed, 2263 using the same studies as SCF (2003). However, no additional uncertainty factor was used. (JRC, 2008) 2264 - ICH Q 3D: Zinc is one of some elemental impurities for which PDEs have not been establish ed due to 2265 their low inherent toxicity and/or differences in regional regulations are not addressed in this 2266 guideline. If these elemental impurities are present or included in the drug product, they are 2267 addressed by other guidelines and/or regional regulati ons and practices that may be applicable for 2268 particular elements. 2269 Conclusions and recommendations 2270 \"the SRL for zinc is set at 5 mg/kg\" 2271 It was decided to follow the opinion issued by the SCF (2003) and EFSA (2006) with a derived upper 2272 limit of 25 mg/day. 2273 Furthermore, intake data from multiple European countries to estimate worst -case oral exposure 2274 from zinc were provided. The calculated worst -case intake from food and supplements at the 95th 2275 percentile resulted in a daily intake of 20 mg/day. Sin ce this value is below the toxicologically derived 2276 limit of 25 mg/day the difference of 5 mg/day can be allocated to exposure from food contact 2277 materials made from metals and alloys. 2278 Consequently, assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that 2279 is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the SRL for 2280 zinc is set at 5 mg/kg. 2281 References 2282 ANSES (2011).

Opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on the tolerable upper intake level of Zinc, 2319 European Commission, 2003. 2320 WHO (2017): Guidelines for drinking -water quality: fourth 20th most common element in the Earth's crust and is found as compounds in many 2325 mineral forms. It does not occur in nature as a free element. Zirconium most commonly occurs as 2326 zircon (ZrSiO 4) and as baddeleyite (ZrO 2 or zirconia). There is no evidence that zir conium is essential 2327 to man. Zirconium is highly resistant to heat and corrosion. It is primarily used in metallic materials 2328 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 75/134 within the aviation and aerospace industries, in chemical and surgical instruments and in nuclear 2329 reactor technology. Other products that contain zirconium compounds include cosmetics and 2330 jewellery. Zirconium is also used for the manufacture of cast iron, steel, ceramics, enamels, paints, 2331 pigments, preservatives, coatings, abrasives, refractories, water repellents (H SDB, 2332 ILO). 2333 Sources and levels of intake 2334 Zirconium is a naturally occurring and widely distributed element. It is present at concentrations 2335 ranging from 150 to 300 mg/kg within the Earth's crust (HSDB) and about 0.026 g/L in seawater 2336 (Peterson et al., 2007). Zirconium compounds can be released into the air and surface or ground water 2337 through weathering of rocks and soils and are taken up by plants, including edible fruits and vegetables 2338 (Ghosh et al., 1992). Zirconium can be found in all animal tissues, gen erally below 10 \u00b5g/g wet tissue 2339 (Health Council of The Netherlands, 2002). In food products, elevated levels of zirconium have been 2340 found in lamb, pork, eggs, dairy products, grains and vegetables, with concentrations generally varying 2341 between 3 and 10 ppm (HSDB). 2342 Exposure to zirconium can occur through the inhalation of ambient air containing low levels of 2343 zirconium, ingestion of certain foods and via dermal contact with consumer products containing 2344 zirconium compounds, such as cosmetics. Estimations of the daily oral intake of zirconium in man vary 2345 from 3.5 to 4 mg, but have been reported to be as high as 125 mg. The average body burden is 260 2346 mg (HSDB). 2347 Metallic food contact materials 2348 Zirconium is used in a wide variety of materials. Certain applications (i.e. refractories, enamels and 2349 coating for casting moulds) make the presence of zirconium in metallic food contact materials more 2350 likely. A specific example is the use of zirconium compounds as passivation agents for tin -plated steel. 2351 Other food contac t materials 2352 Zirconium (II) is a component of some Ziegler -Natta catalysts, used to produce polypropylene (Shamiri 2353 et al., 2014). Because of its mechanical strength and flexibility, zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) is used for 2354 sintering into ceramic knives. 2355 Relea se 2356 The release of zirconium into foodstuffs will potentially depend on the specific compound and its 2357 associated chemical properties, most importantly solubility. Since no data has been published on the 2358 concentrations of zirconium in food contact materials, the release of zirconium from these materials 2359 into foodstuffs cannot be assessed. 2360 Safety aspects 2361 A maximum limit for zirconium in stainless steel was imposed in France, stating that zirconium can 2362 only make up 1% of the alloy (French Decree of 13 January 1976; JRC, 2017). 2363 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 76/134 In the USA, zirconium oxide is permitted for use in conversion coatings on the interior of tin-plated 2364 steel containers (cans), with or without a polymeric topcoat. The coating may be applied to the food - 2365 contact surface at a maximum coating weight of 9 mg/m2. The finished coating may be in contact with 2366 all food types, with the exception of liquid (concentrate and ready to feed) infant formula (NCBI; FDA). 2367 The administrative exposure limit (MAC) for zirconium and zirconium compounds in the Netherlands 2368 is 5 mg/m3, 8 -hour TWA (time-weighted average) (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2002). 2369 The route of absorption and excretion has not been established for all zirconium compounds and 2370 depends on the route and duration of exposure (Ghosh et al., 1992). Most zirconium compounds are 2371 poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. Following oral absorption, 2372 absorption percentages of 0.2 and 0.001% have been reported. The predominant excretion route is 2373 via the faeces; very little is excreted in the urine. Tissue levels are generally below 10 g/g wet tissue 2374 (Health Council of The Netherlands, 2002). Milk is a second route of excretion. Significant amounts of 2375 zirconium have also been found in foetuses (HSDB). 2376 Regarding the toxicity of zirconium, few animal studies are available and these show non -uniform 2377 results among the different zirconium compounds. In humans, few case reports are available, some 2378 of which suggest toxic effects after exposure to zirconium compounds via different routes (mostly 2379 inhalation); others show no zirconium-related effects (HSDB). Overall, based on the available 2380 literature, no definitive conclusion can be drawn on the potential for zirconium to produce toxic 2381 effects. The Dutch Health Council concluded in 20 12 that the available toxicological database on 2382 zirconium and its compounds was too poor to justify recommendation of a health-based occupational 2383 limit, including the exposure limit (MAC) stated in the Netherlands (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2384 2002). 2385 A specific migration limit (SML) of 2 mg/kg has been established for zirconium used for passivation of 2386 metals and alloys in the Netherlands (Dutch WVG), in combination with the following provisions: \"For 2387 contact with acidic foods, conformity with this SM L is to be tested in the relevant food product, or 2388 alternatively with 1.5% citric acid. If the properties of acetic acid predominate in the foodstuffs with 2389 which the metal comes into contact, the metal passivated with zirconium must be coated with organic 2390 polymers. This provision does not apply to zirconium passivated metal in contact with non -acidic food 2391 or in contact with food in which the properties of acids other than acetic acid predominate.\" 2392 Conclusions and recommendations 2393 \"the SRL for zirconium is s et at 2 mg/kg\" 2394 Given the lack of data available to derive a TDI, the CD -P-MCA has decided to use the SRL of 2 mg/kg 2395 as set for zirconium in the legislation on FCM in the Netherlands. For acidic foods, conformity with the 2396 SRL should be tested in the relevant food product, or alternatively with 0.5% citric acid. Zirconium - 2397 passivated metals should not be used in direct contact with food with predominantly acetic acidic 2398 properties, but it can be used in direct contact with other types of food, including acidic food in which 2399 the properties of acids other than acetic acid (e.g. citric acidic) predominate. 2400 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 77/134 References 2401 Dutch WVG \"Metals\" 2403 https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0034991 2404 FDA.

Several hundreds of these mineral species are known. 2450 Arsenic and its compounds are used as pesticides, herbicides and insecticides. 2451 The arsenic content of some iron ores is similar to their phosphorus content. Both substances enter 2452 the steel production as impurities from raw materials and/or processing contaminants and may 2453 adversely affect steel quality. The presence of arsenic reduces impact strength of steel. 2454 Sources and levels of i ntake 2455 Seafood and fish are foodstuffs rich in arsenic. Many types of vegetable also contain arsenic (e.g. 2456 cabbage and spinach) (Schoof et al., 1999; Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2011; Arnich et al., 2012). It is also found in 2457 some sources of drinking- water. 2458 Making a number of assumptions for the contribution of inorganic arsenic to total arsenic, the 2459 inorganic arsenic exposure from food and water across 19 European countries, using lower bound and 2460 upper bound concentrations, has been estimated to range from 0.13 to 0 .56 g/kg body weight/day 2461 for average consumers, and from 0.37 to 1.22 g/kg body weight/day for 95th percentile consumers. 2462 Dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic for children under three years of age is in general estimated to 2463 be from 2 to 3-fold that of a dults (EFSA, 2009). ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake of inorganic 2464 arsenic 0.28 \u00b5g/kg bw/day in adults and \u00b5g/kg bw/day in children (according to upper bound 2465 concentrations). 2466 Metallic food contact materials 2467 Some of the less common food contact alloys can contain arsenic. Special types of brass are obtained 2468 by incorporating one or more additional elements such as tin, aluminium, manganese, nickel, iron, 2469 silicon or even arsenic, which improves some of their properties, particularly their m echanical 2470 characteristics, mostly to increase their resistance to corrosion. 2471 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 79/134 In France, tin or tin alloys and articles exclusively coated with tin or tin alloy or partly tin-plated, which 2472 as finished products are designed to come into direct, recurrent contact with foodstuffs, must not 2473 exceed a maximum arsenic content of 0.030% (French Decree of 28 June 1912). 2474 Other food contact materials 2475 Arsenic is used in the processing of the following products: glass, pigments, textiles, paper, metal 2476 adhesives, ceramic s and wood conservation agents. 2477 Orpiment is an arsenic sulphide mineral found naturally or produced artificially. It is also known in 2478 French as jaune d'arsenic. It has a fine, golden yellow colour and has been known since the second 2479 millennium BC. Its use as a pigment was abandoned after the arrival of cadmium pigments in the 19th 2480 century. 2481 Release 2482 No information available. 2483 Safety Aspects 2484 - WHO (2017) established a provisional guideline value for arsenic in drinking -water of 0.01 mg/L on 2485 the basis of tre atment performance and analytical achievability. 2486 - The arsenic was set in 1988 2487 (JECFA, 1989). In 2010, at the recent 72nd JECFA meeting, arsenic was reassessed and a benchmark 2488 dose approa ch was used to assess the epidemiological data available. The inorganic arsenic lower limit 2489 of the benchmark dose for a 0.5% increased incidence of lung cancer (BMDL05) was determined from 2490 epidemiological studies to be 3.0 g/kg body weight/day (2 -7 g/kg body weight/day based on the 2491 range of estimated total dietary exposure) using a range of assumptions to estimate total dietary 2492 exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking- water and food. As the previous PTWI (JECFA1989) is 2493 within this range, it was no long er considered appropriate and it has since been withdrawn (JECFA, 2494 2010). 2495 - In their 2008 statement the COT considered that inorganic arsenic is genotoxic and a known human 2496 carcinogen and, therefore, exposure should be as low as reasonably practicable (COT, 2008). 2497 - EFSA (2009, 2010) used a benchmark dose (BMD) approach to assess arsenic, using data from key 2498 epidemiological studies and noting other modelling results. A benchmark response of 1% extra risk 2499 was selected and the range of the 95% lower confidenc e interval of the dose (BMDL01) causing this 2500 response was considered. Lung cancer had the lowest BMDL01, with an overall range of 0.3 -8.0 \u00b5g/kg 2501 body weight/day. There is little or no margin of exposure between estimated dietary exposure and 2502 this range and therefore the possibility of a risk to consumers cannot be excluded. 2503 Conclusions and recommendations 2504 \"the SRL for arsenic at 0.002 mg/kg\" 2505 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 80/134 Arsenic can be found in the form of impurities in many metals and alloys. Efforts are therefore needed 2506 to prevent its possible release. 2507 In light of the recent COT, EFSA and JECFA (COT, 2508 JECFA (1989) PTWI as a basis for deriving a specific release limit was not considered appropriate. 2509 Instead, the lower end of the BMDL01 from the EFSA (2009) assessment was used, resulting in a limit 2510 of 0.0003 mg/kg body weight/day (0.018 mg/day). considered an impurity in the metallic 2511 material, it was concluded that an allowance of 10% of the toxicological refer ence values was 2512 reasonable.

Fourth edition incorporating the first addendum. 2540 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 81/134 The mineral Barytine is the raw material from which virtually all barium compounds are derived. World 2541 production of barite in 1985 was estimated at 5.7 million tonnes (WHO, 1990). Barium and its 2542 compounds are used in various industrial products, ranging from ceramics to lubricants. It is also used 2543 in the manufacture of alloys, as a weighting element for paper, soap, rubber and linoleum, and in the 2544 manufacture of valves (WHO, 1990). 2545 Sources and l evels of intake 2546 The main sources of barium in the human diet are milk, potatoes and flour. Some cereal products and 2547 nuts tend to have high barium content, e.g. groundnuts, bran flakes and Brazil nuts (WHO, 1990). 2548 Some plant species accumulate barium when they grow in a soil rich in this element (WHO, 1990). 2549 In the British total diet study, the highest total mean and 97.5th percentile exposures were in the 1.5 2550 to 3 years age class and were 20 g/kg bw/day and 33 g/kg bw/day, respectively (FSA, 2014). 2551 S (2011) estimated daily intake at 0.38 mg/day (6.4 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day) in adults and 2552 10.2 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day in children. 2553 Metallic food contact materials 2554 Barium is to be found in certain metals and alloys in the form of impurities. Barium rea cts strongly 2555 with metals to form metal alloys. Iron is the most resistant metal to barium. Barium forms inter -metal 2556 compounds and alloys with lead, potassium, platinum, magnesium, silicon, zinc, aluminium and 2557 mercury (Hansen, 1958). Metallic barium reduces oxides, halides, sulphides and most of the less 2558 reactive metals, resulting in their elemental state. It is therefore used in molten salt baths for thermal 2559 treatment of metals. Metal bromates [Ba(BrO 3)2] are preparing rare 2560 inhib iting corrosion in low -carbon steels. It is used in aluminium refining and leather tanning. The 2561 chromate (BaCrO 4) is an anti -corrosion pigment for metals. It is used in alloys with aluminium, 2562 magnesium and nickel for specific applications. 2563 Other food con tact materials 2564 Barium and barium compounds are used in ceramics and as a weighting element for paper, rubber 2565 and valve manufacture. 2566 The chloride, BaCl 2, is used in the pigment, lacquer and glass industries. In the dyeing industry, it is 2567 used as a mordent a nd load, as well as in dyeing textile fibres. The chromate, BaCrO 4, is also used to 2568 colour glass, ceramics and porcelain. 2569 Release 2570 No information available. 2571 Safety aspects 2572 - EPA (1985) derived a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.2 mg/kg/day. In 2005 the EPA re assessed barium 2573 and confirmed the RfD for barium of 0.2 mg/kg body weight/day. However, new studies were taken 2574 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 82/134 into consideration and a benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL) approach was chosen. 2575 Consequently, the RfD was derived from a BMDL5 of 63 m g/kg body weight/day for a 5% increased 2576 risk of nephropathy in mice with an uncertainty factor of 300 (100 for intra - and inter -species 2577 variability and 3 for database deficiencies). 2578 - Health Canada (Federal Ministry) (1990) recommendations on drinking wate r estimate the average 2579 intake of barium at 1 mg/day. 2580 - WHO (2001) specified a TDI of 0.02 mg/kg body weight/day (1.2 mg/day) from an epidemiological 2581 study. In that study, populations from two cities having a 70 -fold difference in drinking water 2582 concentrati ons of barium were investigated. Significant differences in cardiovascular effects, however, 2583 could not be detected. Using the higher barium drinking water concentration of the two cities 2584 compared, a TDI of 0.21 mg/kg body weight/day was derived and divided by an uncertainty factor of 2585 10 to account for database deficiencies and possible differences between adults and children. 2586 - WHO (2017) established a guideline value for barium in drinking water of 1.3 mg/L. 2587 - In their 2008 statement, the UK COT considered that since the WHO TDI was based on studies that 2588 did not show statistically significant effects, it was possible that the LOAEL could be much higher than 2589 the NOAEL and, therefore, the TDI could be overly conservative (COT, 2008). The COT concluded that 2590 exposures of up to 4 -fold above the TDI were not necessarily a toxicological concern. 2591 Conclusions and recommendations 2592 \"the SRL for barium is set at 1.2 mg/kg\" 2593 It was decided to use the EPA RfD of 0.2 mg/kg body weight/day (12 mg/day) to derive the SRL. As 2594 barium is considered an impurity in the metallic material, it was concluded that an allowance of 10% 2595 of the toxicological reference value was reasonable. Therefore, assuming that a person of 60 kg body 2596 weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day tha t is packaged and/or prepared with food contact 2597 materials made from metals and alloys, the SRL for barium is set at 1.2 mg/kg. 2598 References 2599 ANSES (2011).

It is lighter and six times more resilient 2621 than aluminium. It is approximately 1 times more ductile than steel. It is an excellent heat conductor, 2622 is non -magnetic and is resistant to concentrated nitric acid. Under normal conditions of temperature 2623 and pressure beryllium is oxidation -resistant when exposed to air. A thin layer of oxide is formed, 2624 making it hard enough to scratch glass. 2625 In nature, it is mainly found in the form of oxides or complex beryllium-aluminium -silicates known as 2626 beryls, the of which are emeralds and aquamarines. 2627 In view of the scarcity of beryllium in nature (3 mg/kg), it raises no particular enviro nmental concerns, 2628 but its industrial use in coal mining, aeronautics and the nuclear arms industry leads to its dispersal in 2629 the air and its deposition in the environment, contaminating water, soil, air and the human body (Mroz 2630 et al., 2001). There is also controversy about its use in dentistry, for dental prostheses (Mroz et al., 2631 2001). 2632 It is mainly used as a hardening agent in alloys such as moldamax, a copper -beryllium alloy used for 2633 manufacturing moulds for plastics. 2634 Its alloys are light, rigid, heat -resistant and have a low dilation coefficient. It is incorporated into some 2635 special alloys, e.g. materials used for friction. 2636 Sources and levels of intake 2637 The intake in the USA, as estimated by the EPA (1987, 1998), is 0.42 \u00b5g/day via water and food (0.1 2 2638 \u00b5g/day from food and 0.3 \u00b5g/day from water). Much of the intake is, therefore, deemed to come from 2639 drinking-water. On the other hand the WHO (2017) states that beryllium is unlikely to occur in 2640 drinking-water and consequently, it has been \"excluded from guideline value derivation\". Results from 2641 a duplicate diet study in Spain estimated the dietary intake of beryllium equal to 19 \u00b5g/day (Domingo 2642 et al., 2011). 2643 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 84/134 Metallic food contact materials 2644 Beryllium can be found in the form of impurities in some metals and alloys, though seldom as an alloy 2645 component. Although beryllium is theoretically highly unlikely to come into contact with food, its use 2646 in plumbing, boiler -making and piping cannot be precluded. 2647 Other food contact materials 2648 Beryllium oxide can potentially be used in the ceramics industry, but there is no evidence of it being 2649 used for ceramics coming into contact with food. 2650 Release 2651 No information available. 2652 Safety aspects 2653 - The EPA (1998) recommended a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.002 mg/kg body weight/day (i.e. 0.12 2654 mg/day for a person weighing 60 kg) for beryllium. EPA (1987) estimated beryllium intake in the USA 2655 at 0.423 \u00b5g/day via water and food, which is negligible compared to the RfD. 2656 - The WHO (1990) and more recently, the WHO (2001) show tha t there is little data available on oral 2657 toxicity of beryllium and the bulk of the information available pertains to inhalation toxicity and, in 2658 particular, the effects of inhalation in occupationally -exposed workers. The WHO (2001) derived an 2659 oral tolerable intake of 0.002 mg/kg body weight/day. This value was estimated using the BMD10 of 2660 0.46 mg/kg body weight/day at the lower 95% confidence limit for a 10% incidence of small intestinal 2661 lesions in dogs chronically exposed to beryllium sulphate tetrahydrat e and considered equal to the 2662 NOAEL. In addition, an uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for inter-species, 10 for intra -species variation 2663 and 3 for database deficiencies due to a lack of data on developmental effects or mechanistic data, 2664 suggesting this may be an issue) was applied. 2665 Conclusions and recommendations 2666 \"the SRL for beryllium is set at 0.01 mg/kg\" 2667 The proven high toxicity of beryllium means that any potential release must be limited. 2668 The SRL for beryllium was derived on the basis of the o ral tolerable intake of 0.002 mg/kg body 2669 weight/day (0.12 mg/day) (WHO, 2001). As beryllium is considered an impurity in the metallic 2670 material, it was concluded that an allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference value was 2671 reasonable. Therefore, assumi ng that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per 2672 day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the 2673 SRL for beryllium is set at 0.01 mg/kg. 2674 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 85/134 References 2675 Domingo, J.L., Perell\u00f3, G., Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba, J.

Cadmium (Cd) 2692 Cadmium is one of the metallic elements of most concern in the food and environment of man. 2693 Cadmium is widely distributed, occurring in all soils and rocks, including coal, in very lo w 2694 concentrations (<0.1 mg/kg) (ATSDR, 2012; Lind, 1997). Also, zinc ores contain cadmium, which is 2695 emitted during the melting of zinc (Friberg et al., 1986). Cadmium is a relatively rare element (Codex 2696 Standard 193 -1995) and current analytical procedures i ndicate much lower concentrations of the 2697 metal in environmental media than previous measurements had shown due to improved sampling 2698 and analytical techniques (WHO, 1992). Phosphate fertilisers and sewage sludge used on agricultural 2699 land may be significant sources of cadmium (Friberg et al., 1986). 2700 Cadmium metal was previously used as an anti -corrosive, electroplate on steel (Friberg et al., 1986). 2701 Cadmium can be replaced by other less toxic materials, for instance in batteries. 2702 Sources and levels of int ake 2703 Cadmium is found in most foodstuffs in the range of 0.005 -0.1 mg/kg (Friberg et al., 1986). Certain 2704 foodstuffs, e.g. mushrooms, kidneys and oysters, may contain much higher concentrations (Friberg et 2705 al., 1986). The lowest levels of cadmium are found in dairy products and beverages (European 2706 Commission, 2004). Vegetables, cereals and cereal products contribute most to cadmium intakes. 2707 The mean dietary exposure across European countries was calculated to be 2.3 g/kg body 2708 weight/week and the high expos ure was calculated to be 3.0 g/kg body weight/week. Due to their 2709 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 86/134 high consumption of cereals, nuts, oilseeds and pulses, vegetarians have a greater dietary exposure 2710 of up to 5.4 g/kg body weight/week. Regular consumers of bivalve molluscs and wild mushro oms 2711 were also found to have higher dietary exposures of 4.6 and 4.3 g/kg body weight/week, respectively 2712 (EFSA, 2009). ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 1.12 \u00b5g/kg body weight/week in adults 2713 and 1.68 \u00b5g/kg body weight/week in children. 2714 Tobacco sm oking can contribute to a similar internal exposure as that from the diet. House dust can 2715 be an important source of exposure for children (EFSA, 2009). 2716 Metallic food contact materials 2717 The use of cadmium -plated utensils in food processing and preparation is forbidden according to 2718 Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006. Cadmium can occur as impurity in zinc galvanised pipes and in solders 2719 (Friberg et al., 1986). 2720 Other food contact materials 2721 Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide have been used as red, yellow and o range colour pigments 2722 in plastics and various types of paint (Friberg et al., 1986). Cadmium stearate was previously used as 2723 a stabiliser in plastics (Friberg et al., 1986). Cadmium can also be used as a pigment in certain enamels 2724 in food contact materials . Leachable cadmium in enamel pottery and glazes may be a source of 2725 contamination. 2726 Release 2727 The release information on cadmium is limited. Cadmium, like zinc, loses its lustre in moist air and is 2728 rapidly corroded by moist NH3 and SO2. It is readily attac ked by most acids, but more slowly than zinc 2729 (Beliles, 1994). One study could be identified where the release of cadmium from pewter cups was 2730 investigated. Using different beverages (e.g. wine, beer) and simulants (e. g. vinegar, 3% acetic acid), 2731 a release of cadmium ranging from < LOD (beer) to 8.2 \u00b5g/L (3% acetic acid) was measured (Dessuy et 2732 al., 2011). 2733 Safety aspects 2734 - (1993) established a 0.007 weight/week, stating that \"the PTWI not 2735 include a safety factor\" and that \"t here is only a relatively small safety margin between exposure in 2736 the normal diet and exposure that produces deleterious effects\". This value was confirmed by the 2737 JECFA in 2003. During their 73rd meeting in 2010, the JECFA withdrew the PTWI of 0.007 mg/kg body 2738 weight/week and replaced it by a provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) of 0.025 mg/kg body 2739 weight/month, due to the exceptional long half -life of cadmium (JECFA, 2010). 2740 - WHO (2017) established a guideline value for cadmium in drinking -water of 0.003 mg/L. 2741 - In the EU the limit for cadmium in drinking-water has been set to 0.005 mg/L (Directive 2020/2184). 2742 - Cadmium is unique among the metals because of its combination of toxicity in low dosages, long 2743 biologic half -life (about 30 years in human s), its low rate of excretion from the body, and the fact that 2744 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 87/134 it is stored predominantly in the soft tissues (liver and kidney) (Beliles, 1994). The PTWI is based upon 2745 kidney damage and the long half -life of cadmium. The effects of cadmium on humans are 2746 nephrotoxicity, osteotoxicity, cardiovascular -toxicity, genotoxicity and effects on reproduction and 2747 development (EFSA, 2009). Kidney damage also occurs as a result of cadmium exposure (Beliles, 1994). 2748 Occasional peaks in cadmium intake may cause a drastic increase in fractional absorption of cadmium 2749 (Lind, 1997). Ingestion of highly contaminated foodstuffs or drinks results in acute gastrointestinal 2750 effects in the form of diarrhoea and vomiting (Friberg et al., 1986). About 5% of ingested cadmium is 2751 absorbed (Friberg et al., 1986). The speciation of cadmium in foodstuffs may be of importance for the 2752 evaluation of the health hazards associated with areas of cadmium contamination or high cadmium 2753 intake (WHO, 1992). The bioavailability of cadmium differs depending on the form of cadmium 2754 present. For instance, cadmium of animal origin has been shown to have a lower bioavailability in mice 2755 than cadmium of vegetable origin (Lind, 1997). Cooking does not seem to alter the bioavailability of 2756 cadmium of animal origin. 2757 - EFSA (2009) has derived a TWI for cadmium of 0.0025 mg/kg body weight/week. This TWI was 2758 derived from and urinary beta -2- 2759 microglobulin (B2M), a marker for tubular effects in kidneys. Using the benchmark dose lower 2760 confidence limit for a 5% increase in the prevalence of elevated B2M (BMDL5) resulted in a limit of 1 2761 g Cd/g creatinine. Subsequently, the dietary cadmium intake that corresponds to a concentration 2762 below 1 g Cd/g creatinine in the urin e was estimated from exposure data, resulting in the above TWI. 2763 Conclusions and recommendations 2764 \"the SRL for cadmium is set at 0.005 mg/kg\" 2765 The use of cadmium in metals and alloys in materials in contact with foodstuffs is unacceptable due 2766 to its long biological half -life (about 30 years in humans) and its high toxicity. 2767 Electroplated equipment should be coated. 2768 The SRL was derived from the EFSA (2009) assessment, rather than from that of JECFA (2010), because 2769 it resulted in a more conservative limit. Using the EFSA (2009) TWI of 0.0025 mg/kg body weight/week 2770 0.00036 mg/kg body weight/day (0.02 mg/person/day). Using 2771 an allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference value and assuming that a person of 60 kg body 2772 weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact 2773 materials made from metals and alloys, the calculated limit for cadmium would be at 0.002 mg/kg. 2774 However, it was decided to set the SRL at 0.005 mg/kg, which is consistent with the limit for cadmium 2775 stated in Directive 2020/2184. This equals an allowance of 25% of the toxicological reference value. 2776 References 2777 ANSES (2011).

The Earth's crust contains about 15 mg/kg of 2824 lead (Beliles, 1994). Lead is present in the environment in the form of metallic lead, inorganic ions and 2825 salts and organo -metallic compounds. numerous sources of contamination including 2826 accumulators, petrol, recycling of lead batteries and combustion of industrial and household waste. 2827 Lead pollution is decreasing in most parts of the world, as lead-containing chemical s, such as tetraethyl 2828 lead and tetramethyl lead that are used as gasoline additives to increase octane rating, are replaced 2829 by other additives (ATSDR, 2020) and due to recycling of accumulators and batteries. Exposure 2830 through drinking-water, where lead or lead soldered pipes are still used, may contribute significantly 2831 to lead intake. The greatest single use of lead metal today is in batteries for automobiles (Beliles, 2832 1994). Most of the lead in the environment is present as complex bound lead ions in solut ion or as 2833 slightly soluble Pb(II) salts. 2834 Sources and levels of intake 2835 Lead in the soil is only poorly taken up by plant roots and is not transported away from the roots to 2836 the rest of the plant. Therefore, lead levels in plants are, to a large extent, governed by air -borne lead 2837 contamination, which makes leaves and leafy veg etables most vulnerable to air -borne deposition 2838 (EFSA, 2010). Cereal grains have also been shown to absorb substantial amounts of lead via the air 2839 (CCFAC, 1995). The main sources of lead intake are foodstuffs such as vegetables, cereals and cereal 2840 products and drinking-water/materials in contact with drinking water (EFSA, 2010). Game and shellfish 2841 may also contain rather high amounts of lead (EFSA, 2010). 2842 In Europe, lead dietary exposure ranges from 0.36 to 1.24 g/kg body weight/day in average adult 2843 consu mers and up to 2.43 g/kg body weight/day in high -end consumers. Exposure of infants ranges 2844 from 0.21 to 0.94 g/kg body weight/day and of children from 0.80 to 3.10 g/kg body weight/day 2845 (average consumers) and to (high consu mers) (EFSA, 2010). ANSES 2846 (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 0.20 g/kg body weight/day in adults and 0.27 g/kg body 2847 weight/day in children. 2848 Additionally, dust and soil can be significant non -dietary sources in children (EFSA, 2010). 2849 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 90/134 Metallic food co ntact materials 2850 Canned foodstuffs previously contained markedly higher lead levels than fresh foodstuffs and this was 2851 most evident in fruits (Tsuchiya, 1986). However, modern canning techniques without lead soldering 2852 are now typically used (Tsuchiya, 1986) , which has caused a decrease in lead intake from this source. 2853 Metallic lead in food is likely to arise from the presence of lead from shot or partially-jacketed bullets 2854 in game. Lead is also found in the lead solder used to repair equipment. Manufacturing equipment 2855 and household utensils may contain parts made wholly or partly of lead, and such parts may release 2856 lead if they come into contact with food. Lead pipes or lead solder used to repair equipment have also 2857 caused contamination problems. The lead tha t may be found as a contaminant in pewter may also be 2858 released. Tin is also liable to release lead due to its presence in the metal as an impurity; the standard 2859 specification of Ingot tin (according to European Standard EN 610:1995) specifies a maximum 2860 permissible lead content of 0.050% and the standard specification of tinplate (according to European 2861 Standard EN 10333:2005) specifies a maximum permissible lead content of 0.01% . The EU Packaging 2862 Waste Directive (94/62/EC) limits the Pb content of tin cans to less than 100 ppm. 2863 Other food contact materials 2864 Previously, lead pigments were often used in ceramic glazes (Beliles, 1994). However, because lead 2865 pigments are toxic, their use is now restricted. In the EU, lead release is now regulated by Directive 2866 84/500/EEC that sets limits for the release of lead from materials and articles made of ceramics. 2867 Imported products from some countries and handicrafts still need particular attention. White lead is 2868 the most important lead pigment (Beliles, 1994). Also, crys tal glass typically contains 24% lead. 2869 Release 2870 The information on release of lead from metallic food contact materials is limited. One study 2871 investigated the release of lead from pewter cups. Using different beverages (e.g. wine, beer) and 2872 simulants (e.g. vinegar, 3% acetic acid), the lead release ranged from < LOD (beer) to 1.1 mg/L (3% 2873 acetic acid) after 24 h contact time (Dessuy et al., 2011). Further, a survey with teapots made out of 2874 brass found lead release between 1.1 mg/L and 62 mg/L, using citric acid solution (1 g/L) as a simulant 2875 and a contact time of 30 minutes (Bolle et al., 2011). 2876 A minor source of lead in food cans exists in the form of small impurity levels in the tin of the coating. 2877 Most foodstuffs, those based on citric acid, will dissolve only a small amount of it. Only foodstuffs 2878 based on malic acid and in cans without an internal lacquer will show a significant tendency to attack 2879 the lead (Bird et al., 1986). 2880 Safety aspects 2881 - JECFA (1993) established a PTWI 0.025 mg/kg body weight/ week or 0.214 mg/day/person 2882 (average body weight ~60 kg). This limit was confirmed by the JECFA in 2000. During their 73rd 2883 meeting in 2010, the JECFA withdrew the PTWI, concluding that the PTWI could no longer be 2884 considered protective of health (JECFA, 201 0). In children, the level of 1.9 g/kg body weight per day 2885 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 91/134 was associated with a decrease of 3 intelligence quotient (IQ) points, which is deemed by the 2886 Committee to be of concern. 2887 - WHO (2017) established a provisional guideline value for lead in drinkin g-water of 0.01 mg/L, on the 2888 basis of treatment performance and analytical achievability. As this is no longer a healthbased 2889 guideline value, concentrations should be maintained as low as reasonably practical. 2890 - In the EU, the limit for lead in drinking -water has been set to 0.005 mg/L (Directive (EU) 2020/2184). 2891 The parametric value of 0.005 mg/L shall be met, at the latest, by 12 January 2036. The parametric 2892 value for lead until that date shall be 0.010 mg/L. 2893 - For the general population, exposure to lea d occurs primarily via the oral route, with some 2894 contribution through inhalation (EFSA, 2010). In adults, approximately 15 -20% of the ingested lead is 2895 absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (EFSA, 2010). Children however seem to show a higher 2896 absorption ra tes (EFSA, 2010). Lead has a half -life in the blood of about a month, whereas it may have 2897 a half -life as long as 30 years in bones (EFSA, 2010). The toxicity of lead is based on its ability to bind 2898 biologically important molecules and thus to interfere wit h their function (EFSA, 2010). The most 2899 common form of acute lead poisoning is gastrointestinal colic (Beliles, 1994). Dietary lead exposure is 2900 unlikely to represent a significant cancer risk (EFSA, 2010). 2901 - It should be noted that the most critical effect of lead on children has been identified as reduced 2902 cognitive development and intellectual performance. There is no evidence of a threshold for this 2903 effect. This issue was discussed in a JECFA paper on maximum levels for lead in fish (JECFA 2006). 2904 - In their 2008 statement, the COT considered that the JECFA PTWI could not be considered fully 2905 protective for all age groups and that, since it is not possible to identify a threshold for the association 2906 between lead exposure and decrements in intelligence quot ient, efforts should continue to reduce 2907 lead exposure from all sources (COT, 2008). 2908 - In 2010, the EFSA published an opinion on lead using a benchmark dose BMD approach (EFSA, 2010). 2909 Developmental neurotoxicity in young children and cardiovascular effects and nephrotoxicity in adults 2910 were identified as the relevant endpoints for lead. As a result, the EFSA found that neuro -development 2911 effects at current exposure levels are a concern for infants, children and pregnant women. 2912 Consequently, since no threshold of effects for the critical endpoints could be identified, the EFSA 2913 concluded that the JECFA PTWI is no longer appropriate and that further efforts to derive a PTWI 2914 would not be appropriate. The EFSA derived the following 3 benchmark dose lower confidence limits 2915 (BMDL): 2916 - developmental neurotoxicity BMDL01: 0.50 g/kg - effects on pressure BMDL01: 1.50 g/kg body weight/day (90 \u00b5g/day) 2918 - effects on prevalence of chronic kidney disease BMDL10: 0.63 g/kg body weight/day recommendations for lead is set at 0.01 mg/kg\" 2922 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 92/134 Since dietary intake of lead in certain populations exceeds levels where adverse health effects are 2923 caused, its release from food contact materials made from metal and alloys into food should be 2924 reduced as much as possible. 2925 In order to set an SRL for lead, it was decided to use the BMDL10 of 0.63 g/kg body weight/day (38 2926 \u00b5g/day) for chronic kidney disease. As lead is considered an impurity in the metallic material and 2927 intake can be higher than the BMDL10, the allowance for lead release from food contact materials 2928 and articles should not exceed 10% of the toxicological reference value. Therefore, assuming that a 2929 person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per day that is packaged and/or prepared 2930 with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the calculated limit for lead would be at 2931 0.004 mg/kg. 2932 However, it was decided to set the SRL at 0.01 mg/kg, which is consistent with the limit for lead in 2933 drinki ng water, stated in Directive (EU) 2020/2184 to be applicable until January 2036. This equals an 2934 allowance of 26% of the toxicological reference value. 2935 By derogation, the SRL does not apply to tinplated steel sheet used as packaging for foodstuffs for 2936 which a maximum level of lead is set in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, provided that the tin that is 2937 used meets the following specification: Lead content: not more than 0.01%. Due to the restriction on 2938 the maximum level of tin in food as set in the same regulation, the co -release of the lead impurity will 2939 be restricted to an acceptable level. 2940 References 2941 ANSES (2011).

Fourth edition incorporating the first addendum. Lithium (Li) 2986 Lithium is a soft, silvery -white metal which tarnishes and oxidises very qui ckly on contact with air and 2987 water (Winter, 2007). 2988 Lithium is widely distributed across the globe, but it is not found in metallic form because of its high 2989 reactivity (Beliles, 1994). It is mainly encountered as an impurity in the salts of other alkali met als. 2990 Lithium is the lightest solid element. It is mainly used in the manufacture of certain high-performance 2991 alloys used in aeronautics. Lithium is the metal with the lowest molecular mass and also the lightest 2992 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 94/134 metal, with a density half that of water. In accordance with the Dulong -Petit law, it is the solid with 2993 the highest specific heat (Winter, 2007). 2994 Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate, citrate and orotate are used as mood regulators for the 2995 treatment of bipolar and sleep disorders (Winter, 2007). 2996 Sources and levels of intake 2997 Lithium is found in foodstuffs at concentrations ranging from 0.012 -3.4 mg/kg. As the main 2998 contributors grains and vegetables were identified (Schrauzer, 2002). 2999 Mean daily intake through food from multiple countries was estimated between 350 and 1500 \u00b5g/day 3000 (Schrauzer, 2002). ANSES (2011) estimated mean daily intake at 48.2 g/person/day in adults and 19.8 3001 g/person/day in children. Main contributors are water (35%), coffee and other hot beverages in 3002 adults. 3003 Metallic fo od contact aluminium, -cadmium, -copper and - manganese alloys are used in the 3005 manufacture of high -quality mechanical parts, although there is no evidence of such alloys coming 3006 into contact with food. 3007 Other food contact materials 3008 Lithium is sometimes used in low thermal -expansion glasses and ceramics. Release from plastic food 3009 contact materials is regulated (Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011; SML 0.6 mg/kg). 3010 Release 3011 No information available. Safety aspects - RIVM 0.008 mg/day). This derived 3014 from 90-day oral rat studies, mutagenicity data, and therapeutic uses of Li salts. 3015 Conclusions and recommendations 3016 \"the SRL for lithium is set at 0.048 mg/kg\" 3017 Based on the limited information available, the SRL was derived from the TDI of 0.008 weight/day (0.48 mg/day) established the RIVM (1991). As lithium is considered an impurity in the 3019 metallic material, it was concluded that an allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference value was 3020 reasonable. Therefore, assuming that a person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg of foodstuffs per 3021 day that is packaged and/or prepared with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the 3022 SRL for lithium is s et at 0.048 mg/kg. 3023 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 95/134 References 3024 ANSES (2011).

(2007) Chemistry: Periodic Table: lithium: historical information. at 3035 accessed 20 September 2021. 3036 Mercury (Hg) 3037 Mercury is among the metals of most concern for human health, especially organic mercury. Mercury 3038 in ambient air originates mainly from volcanic and industrial activity (Codex Standard 193 -1995). 3039 About 100 tonnes of mercury are released into the global atmosphere each year by the burning of 3040 fossil fuels, melting of sulfide ores, cement manufacture and the heating of other materials containing 3041 mercury (Florence and Batley, 1980). Methyl mercury is biosynthesised from inorganic mercury as a 3042 consequence of microbial activity (ATSDR, 1999). Methyl mercury is found in foodstuffs and, in 3043 particular, in fish and seafood. Much has been done in the last decade to eliminate or reduce mercury 3044 contamination of foodstuffs. 3045 Sources and levels of intake 3046 Mercury is found in concentrations ranging from 0.005 -0.05 mg/kg in foodstuffs. The main contributor 3047 is methyl mercury in fish, which contains between 2 and 4 mg/kg. The average level of mercury in fish 3048 is 0-0.08 mg/kg (Nation al Food Agency of Denmark, 1995). The major source of mercury from fish is 3049 methyl mercury (Beliles, 1994; Berlin, 1986). In Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006, maximum levels for 3050 mercury in fish and food supplements have been specified. 3051 The European Commission, DG-SANCO (2004), estimated a mean dietary intake of mercury among 13 3052 European states equal to 0.006 mg/day (0.1 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day). In the British total diet study 3053 (2014), total mercury was measured (sum of inorganic mercury and methylmercury) and mer cury was 3054 detected at low levels or below the LOD. The highest concentration was 0.0497 mg/kg measured in 3055 the fish group (FSA, 2014). 3056 ANSES (2011) estimated the mean daily intake of inorganic mercury between 0.006 and 0.18 g/kg 3057 body weight/day in adults a nd between 0.014 and 0.26 g/kg body weight/day in children (according 3058 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 96/134 to lower bound or upper bound concentrations). Mean daily intake of organic mercury via fish and 3059 seafood products were estimated at 0.017g/kg body weight/day in adults and 0.022 g/kg body 3060 weight/day in children. 3061 Other sources of mercury may be the chloro -alkali industry, the electrical industry, manufacture of 3062 paints, instruments, agrochemicals and other specialist items. 3063 Mercury has a propensity to form alloys (amalgams) with almost all other metals, except iron (Beliles, 3064 1994). Dental amalgam contains tin and silver (and sometimes gold) dissolved in mercury (Beliles, 3065 1994). 3066 The safety of the use of dental amalgam and its substitutes is subject to specific risk assessment by 3067 the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). The use of dental 3068 amalgam has been banned in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and has also been discouraged in other 3069 EU countries (Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, 2007; Swedish Ministry of the Environment, 3070 2009; European Commission, 2008). 3071 Metallic food contact materials 3072 Due to its physico -chemical properties and, in particular its known toxicity, mercury is not used in food 3073 contact materials. 3074 Release 3075 No information is avail able. 3076 Safety aspects 3077 - JECFA (1978; 1988) established a PTWI of 0.005 mg/kg body weight/week for mercury, but with a 3078 maximum of 0.0033 mg/kg body weight/week for methyl mercury. However, it was stated that this 3079 PTWI might not adequately protect foetuses. In 2010, a PTWI of 0.004 mg/kg body weight/week 3080 for inorganic mercury in foods other than fish and shellfish was established (JECFA, 2010). The 3081 previous PTWI for total mercury was withdrawn. The new PTWI of 0.004 mg/kg body weight/week 3082 was based on th e benchmark dose lower limit (BMDL10 of 0.06 mg/kg body weight/day) for a 10% 3083 increase in relative kidney weight in male rats, the application of an uncertainty factor of 100 and 3084 extrapolation to a weekly limit. 3085 - In line with JECFA 2010, the CONTAM Panel of EFSA established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for 3086 inorganic mercury of 4 \u00b5g/kg b.w., expressed as mercury (EFSA, 2012). 3087 - WHO (2017) established a guideline value for inorganic mercury in drinking -water of 0.006 mg/L. 3088 - Mercury, in its metallic form, is unlikely to cause poisoning by ingestion, whereas the vapour is toxic. 3089 Methyl mercury is the most toxic form of organic mercury (Codex Standard 193 -1995). The oral 3090 absorption of elemental mercury is limited and may be approximately 0.1% (Beliles, 1994) . Some 3091 inorganic mercury salts and organic mercury compounds may be more readily absorbed, e.g. methyl 3092 mercury which is absorbed completely (Beliles , 1994). The toxic properties of mercury vapour are due 3093 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 97/134 to mercury accumulation in the brain, causing an uns pecific psychoasthenic and vegetative 3094 neurological syndrome (micromercurialism) (Berlin, 1986). At high exposure levels, mercurial tremor 3095 is seen, accompanied by severe behavioural and personality changes, increased excitability, loss of 3096 memory and insomni a (Berlin, 1986). Low concentrations of methyl mercury cause cell death and 3097 inhibition of cell proliferation in cell cultures, whereas mercury chloride primarily disrupts the plasma 3098 membrane (Braeckman et al. , 1997). Methyl mercury is listed as one of the six most dangerous 3099 chemicals in the environment. Inorganic mercury is classified as a carcinogen. However, there is a lack 3100 of data on risks to humans (Beliles, 1994). Mercury and silver interferes with copper distribution. The 3101 general population is exposed to methyl mercury primarily through their diet (organic mercury) and 3102 dental amalgam \"fillings\" (inorganic mercury) (ATSDR, 1999). 3103 - An IPCS Group (WHO, 2003) recommended a TDI of 0.002 mg/kg body weight/day for 3104 inorganic Hg on the NOAEL of 0 .23 mg/kg body weight/day for kidney effects from a 26-week 3105 study in rats (NTP, 1993) and applying an uncertainty factor of 100 (for inter-species and intra -species 3106 variation) after adjusting for dosages 5 days/week. A similar TDI was obtained by applying an 3107 uncertainty factor of 1,000 (an additional uncertainty factor of 10 for adjustment from a LOAEL to a 3108 NOAEL) to the LOAEL for renal effects of 1.9 mg/kg body weight/day from a 2-year study in rats 1993). 3110 Conclusions and recommendations 3111 mercury is set at 0.003 mg/kg\" 3112 Mercury is one of the most dangerous metals for human health. 3113 The SRL was derived from the JECFA (2010) and EFSA (2012) assessments. Using the TWI of 0.004 3114 mg/kg body weight/week as a starting resulted TDI of 0.0006 mg/kg body weight/day (0.03 3115 mg/day). As mercury is considered an impurity in the metallic material, the P -SC-EMB concluded that 3116 an allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference value was reasonable. Therefore, assuming that a 3117 person of 60 kg body weight consumes 1 kg per of foodstuffs day that is packaged and/or prepared 3118 with food contact materials made from metals and alloys, the SRL for mercury is set at 0.003 mg/kg. 3119 References 3120 ANSES (2011).

Thallium is found in zinc, copper, iron 3183 and lead ores (Peter and Viraraghavan, 2005). Only very rare minerals (lorandite, crookesite, etc.) 3184 contain thallium (Shaw, 1952). Pyrite ash used to manufacture cement may contain considerable 3185 quantities of thallium (Peter and Viraraghavan, 2005). 3186 Sources and levels of intake 3187 According to currently available data, the risk of excessive public exposure to Tl is low. To date, only a 3188 few studies investigating the human health risks associated with dust deposits from certain industries 3189 (e.g. cement works) have been conducted (Brockhaus et al., 1981). Thallium can be found in 3190 vegetables, potatoes and fish at conc entrations around 0.001 mg/kg (FSA, 2014). 3191 estimated at < 5 \u00b5g/day (Sherlock, 1986).In the 2014 British total diet study the 3192 highest total mean and 97.5th percentile exposures were in the 1.5 to 3 years age group and were 3193 0.021 - Metallic food contact materials 3195 This highly toxic metal can be found as an impurity in alloys. The French Decree of 27/8/1987 lays 3196 down a maximal quantity of thallium in aluminium of 0.05%. Furthermor e, the addition of thallium to 3197 certain metals apparently increases their resistance to deformation and corrosion. However, there is 3198 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 100/134 no evidence of any thallium use in a food-related context, although neither has its absence (as a 3199 component or impurity) fro m metals or alloys been demonstrated. 3200 Other food contact materials 3201 No information available. 3202 Release 3203 No information available. 3204 Safety aspects 3205 - In humans, gastroenteritis, polyneuropathy and alopecia are the classical symptoms of poisoning. 3206 Most assessments are based on a sub -chronic 90 -days -study on rats (MRI 1988) identifying alopecia 3207 as most critical endpoint. The authors of this study derived a NOAEL of 0.2 mg/kg body weight from 3208 the highest concentration applied. 3209 - EPA (2009) based their evaluation on the above mentioned study, but considered the highest dose 3210 of thallium applied (0.2 mg/kg bw./day) as LOAEL due to hair follicle atrophy and identified the second 3211 highest dose as NOAEL (0.04 mg/kg bw./day). Due to uncertainties in the study, EPA chose not to 3212 derive an RfD. 3213 - In a 2008 COT statement, no health -based guidance values for thallium were expressed, but the 3214 current UK dietary exposures were considered unlikely to be of toxicological concern (COT, 2008). COT 3215 considered in its assessme nt the statement of the WHO (1996). 3216 - The WHO (1996) considered that exposures resulting in urinary thallium levels of 5 \u00b5g/L are unlikely 3217 to cause adverse health effects. This level corresponds to an oral intake of 10 \u00b5g/day of thallium in a 3218 soluble form (0.17 \u00b5g/kg body weight/day for a 60 kg adult). WHO concluded that due to the 3219 uncertainties relating to thallium toxicity, it could not derive a health based exposure limit. 3220 Furthermore, in the absence of better dose-response relationship data, it would seem prudent to 3221 ensure that intakes should be below 10 \u00b5g/day. 3222 - Germany's environmental protection agency - Umweltbundesamt - derived a HBM -I value of 5 g/L 3223 urine (UBA 2011) based on an epidemiological study et al., 1981). The HBM -I-value 3224 repres ents the concentration of a substance in human biological material below which - according to 3225 the knowledge and judgement of the HBM Commission - there is no risk for adverse health effects 3226 and, consequently, no need for action. This was done by correlatin g the thallium exposure and the 3227 prevalence of certain symptoms known to be associated with chronic thallium intoxication. This urine 3228 concentration corresponded to an oral exposure of 10 \u00b5g/person/day (adult of 60 kg body weight). 3229 - The Netherland's RIVM ev aluated thallium in 1998. No 3230 carcinogenicity studies had been carried out and the genotoxic potential was examined to a limited 3231 extent only. The results of studies on reproductive toxicity indicate that thallium compounds a dversely 3232 affect the male reproductive system. Due to limitations in the data set, only a provisional TDI (PDTI) 3233 could be derived for thallium and its compounds (0.2 g/kg body weight) (RIVM, 1998). 3234 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 101/134 Conclusions and recommendations 3235 \"the th allium is set at 0.001 mg/kg\" 3236 The acceptable oral exposure of 10 \u00b5g/person/day (UBA 2011) derived by WHO (1996), UBA (2011) 3237 and the PTDI by RIVM are of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, it is recommended to derive 3238 the SRL based on these data. As thal lium is considered an impurity in the metallic material, an 3239 allowance of 10% of the toxicological reference value is applicable.

Alloys are homogeneous at a 3280 macroscopic scale and their components cannot be separated by mechanical means. Alloying 3281 elements are incorporated into the metallic matrix to form a new metallurgical structure that 3282 enhances specific properties of the metal (e.g. tensile strength, corrosion resistance, electrical or 3283 thermal conductivity). The metallurgical structure depends on the alloy composition, but also on the 3284 different thermal and mechanical processes applied during production of the material. 3285 Main types of alloys 3286 Most metals are mainly used in alloy form. The following alloys are amongst those most commonly 3287 used for food contact applications: 3288 -- Steel is an alloy made of iron and carbon (less than 2% carbon). Other elements (e.g. nickel, 3289 chromium and/or molybdenum) may be alloyed with iron and carbon to provide desired properties. 3290 -- Cast iron is an iron alloy containing 2 to 4% carbon and small amounts of ma nganese, silicon and 3291 phosphorus. 3292 -- Stainless steels are iron -chromium alloys which contain a minimum of 10.5% chromium (usually 3293 17-18%) and less than 1.2% carbon (Heubner, 2009), and which are often also alloyed with elements 3294 such as nickel, molybdenum, etc., to provide desired properties (see chapter 2 on stainless steels). 3295 Increasing levels of chromium beyond 10.5% further improves corrosion resistance. 3296 -- Aluminium alloys for food contact materials may contain alloying elements such as magnesium, 3297 silico n, iron, manganese, copper and zinc (European Standard EN 601; European Standard EN 602). 3298 -- Bronze consists of 80 -95% copper and 5 -20% tin. 3299 -- Brass consists of 60 -70% copper and 30-40% zinc. 3300 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 103/134 -- German silver (also known as nickel silver and Maillechort) is a range of copper -based alloys with 3301 the nickel content ranging from 10 -20%. Maillechort has chemical composition of 60 -64% copper, 17- 3302 19% nickel and the remainder zinc, which is specified in EN 1652 and has the designation CW 409J. 3303 -- Nickel bronze (als o known as Dairy bronze and Thai bronze) is an alloy consisting of 63 -67% Cu, 3.5 - 3304 4.5 -- Pewter alloy is made up of tin, antimony and copper in the following percentages: tin 91 -95%, 3306 antimo ny 2.5 -8%, copper 0.05-2.5%. 3307 -- Other alloys are used in small quantities, for example nickel-copper, and non -stick Al -Cu-Fe-Cr 3308 quasi -crystal - coatings. 3309 The composition of an alloy is usually presented as a concentration range for each individual element. 3310 This is because national and international standards specify permissible concentration ranges. Within 3311 the ranges given in these standards, the properties of the alloy will be the same. Besides the principal 3312 alloying elements that define the alloy type, oth er \"minor\" alloying elements can be added to enhance 3313 a specific property of the material (e.g. the addition of 1 -6% Pb in brass to improve the machinability 3314 of the material). Alloys may also contain metallic impurities from raw materials and production 3315 processes. Maximum permissible impurity concentrations are set in the alloy specification and are 3316 generally less than 0.5%, depending on the alloy type. 3317 Release 3318 Measurable amounts of metallic elements in the alloy may be released into foodstuffs during food 3319 preparation and cooking, leading to human ingestion. Studies on a variety of metallic food contact 3320 materials have been conducted to assess whether such releases could impair food quality and/or are 3321 a cause of concern for human health (Flint and Packirisamy, (1995); Flint and Packirisamy, 1997); 3322 Vrochte et al., 1991). 3323 In one such study, release tests were carried out on coffee -pots (mocha -type pots) with different 3324 compositions of aluminium alloys. The coffee pots consisted of alloys containing 0.09 -0.77% zinc , 0.19- 3325 5.5% copper, 0.02-0.5% lead, as well as other metallic elements. The release of copper, zinc and lead 3326 was determined. The results showed that increasing amounts of copper in the starting alloy did not 3327 correspond to increased copper release. Also, re peated use gave irregular, but decreasing, release of 3328 all the tested metals (Gramiccioni et al., 1996). 3329 Safety aspects 3330 -- When assessing the risk of the use of one or more substances incorporated into a special 3331 preparation (for instance alloys), the way th e constituent substances are bonded in the chemical 3332 matrix shall be taken into account (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006). 3333 -- There are no specific toxicological evaluations for the individual alloys used for direct food contact 3334 and, therefore, any safety assessment is usually based on the information available for individual 3335 elements. 3336 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 104/134 -- The constituent elements of an alloy are released from the alloy as individual elements. 3337 -- There is usually less release of elements from alloys than from unalloyed metals d ue to the 3338 microstructure and surface properties of the alloys. The constituents of alloys are bound together in 3339 a chemical matrix, essentially forming solid solutions and new compounds. 3340 Conclusions and recommendations 3341 -- Any metallic element released from an alloy should comply with the corresponding specific release 3342 limit (SRL, chapter 1). 3343 -- In the absence of a specific safety evaluation of an alloy, the safety of any released amounts of the 3344 individual elements should be evaluated. 3345 -- Cadmium must not be added intentionally. 3346 References 3347 EN 601:2004, Aluminium and aluminium alloys - Castings - Chemical composition of castings for use 3348 in contact with food. 3349 EN 602:2004, Aluminium and aluminium alloys - Wrought products - Chemical composition of semi 3350 products used for the fabrication of articles for use in contact with food. 3351 EN 1652:1997, Copper and copper alloys - Plates, sheet, strip and circles for general purposes. 3352 Flint, G.N., Packirisamy, S.

Increasing the chromium content from a minimum of 10.5% to 17 or 20% also increases the 3378 stability of the passive film. This film, only a few nanometers thick (Olsson and Landolt, 2003), forms 3379 almost instantaneously on contact with the oxygen in air or water. Abrasion or other forms of surface 3380 damage do not easily lead to f ilm breakdown and, if damaged, the film rapidly reforms. Nickel 3381 promotes repassivation and molybdenum is very effective in stabilising the film in the presence of 3382 chlorides. Hence, these two alloying elements are used in many of the stainless steels used in food 3383 contact applications. 3384 Main types of stainless steel 3385 Stainless steels vary in composition, but always contain a high percentage of chromium (a minimum 3386 of 10.5%). The majority of stainless steels used in food contact applications contain 16 -18% of 3387 chromium (except martensitic stainless steel for cutlery and knife blades), as this has been found to 3388 be the optimum chromium concentration for corrosion resistance in a wide range of food and 3389 beverages. 3390 Stainless steels may be sub -divided into families accor ding to their metallurgical structure. European 3391 Standard EN 10088 series specifies the chemical composition of stainless steels; some of which are 3392 commonly used for food contact applications: 3393 -- Martensitic stainless steels: 11.5 -19% chromium, with (0- 2%) or medium (4 -7%) nickel. They 3394 may contain molybdenum (up to 2.8%) and vanadium (up to 0.2%). Sub -families with varying amounts 3395 of carbon, with or without molybdenum, are used for particular applications. Some typical 3396 compositions and applications are: 3397 -- 13% chromium, 0.2% no for cutlery. 3398 -- 13% chromium, 0.4% carbon, plus molybdenum, nickel, used for high quality cutlery. 3399 -- chromium, >0.4% carbon, 0.5 knives. 3401 -- Ferritic stainless steels: minimum 10.5 -30% chromium and maximum 1% nickel. Some grades may 3402 contain up to 4% molybdenum, and aluminium may be used as an alloying element. 16 -21% chromium 3403 is used in cutlery, hollo wware, table surfaces, panels and worktops. 3404 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 106/134 -- Austenitic stainless steels: for food contact applications, typically contain a minimum of 16% 3405 chromium and 6% nickel. Austenitic grades (mainly the so called 300 series stainless steels) with 3406 varying amounts of chromium and nickel, sometimes with other elements (e.g. molybdenum, copper), 3407 are used in a very wide range of food contact applications: both domestic and industrial cutlery, 3408 hollowware and kitchen typically having 18% 8 -10% nicke l; higher alloy grades 3409 used for food processing, storage and transport equipment, pipe- work, etc., having 17% chromium, 3410 11% nickel and molybdenum). Grades containing molybdenum (approximately 2 -3%) are 3411 particularly resistant to the corrosion caused by s alt-containing foods (Eric Partington 2006). 3412 Recent years have seen an increasing use of the so -called 200 series stainless steels, where manganese 3413 (up to 8%) is substituted for nickel, for food contact applications. These grades also contain nitrogen 3414 and copper to further stabilise the austenitic structure of the steel and which, respectively, provide 3415 additional strength and improved cold forming properties. However, although the 200 series are 3416 austenitic stainless steels, their corrosion resistance is generally not equal to that of the 300 series 3417 stainless steels. According to EN ISO 8442 -1 austenitic stainless steels for cutlery are divided groups: 3419 -- CrNi - minimum 17% Cr, series) 3420 CrMn - 17% 4% Ni, 7.5% Mn (200 series) 3421 Super -austenitic grades -25% chromium, 20 -25% nickel, 4.5-6.5% molybdenum 3422 and sometimes with copper additions) are used in contact with food containing very high levels of salt 3423 (e.g. soy sauce; 17% chloride) and also for brines, etc. 3424 -- Austeno -ferritic steels, also known as Duplex steels, contain 21 -28% chromium, 0 -4.5% 3425 molybdenum, 1.35 -8% nickel, 0.05-0.3% nitrogen and up to 1% tungsten. These stainless steels may 3426 be used in contact with corrosive fo odstuffs as they have a very high resistance to corrosion caused 3427 by, for example, saline solutions at high temperatures. 3428 Composition limits 3429 There are no universal composition limits for stainless steels used in food contact applications, 3430 although there are legislative requirements in France, Italy and Greece. In France, stainless steels for 3431 food contact products must contain at least 13% of chromium and can contain nickel and manganese. 3432 Maximum limits are imposed for certain other alloying elements (4% for Mo, Ti, Al and Cu; 1% for Ta, 3433 Nb and Zr). In Italy, there is a positive list of stainless steel grades for use as food contact materials. 3434 These grades must pass metal release tests for corrosion in distilled water, olive oil, an aqueous 3435 solution of ethanol and 3% acetic acid in water, under specified conditions. New grades can be added 3436 to the positive list following appropriate testing. In Greece, stainless steels for food contact products 3437 must contain at least 12% (w/w) of chromium. Maximum limits are impo sed for certain other alloying 3438 elements (4% for Mo, Ti, Al and Ta, Nb and Zr; 0.5% for Cd and 0.05% for As). 3439 In the UK, there are numerous specifications for a wide range of food contact applications for stainless 3440 steels. Other countries also have similar regulations. References to some of the Italian, French, UK and 3441 German legislation/standards (e.g. DIN 18 865 and DIN 18 866) are given below. 3442 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 107/134 In addition, there are European and International standards for certain types of applicat ion of stainless 3443 steels. The composition limits for stainless steel for table cutlery (knives, forks, spoons, carving sets, 3444 ladles, children's cutlery and other serving utensils) are specified in EN ISO 8442 -2; specified 3445 compositions are linked to the appl ication of the table cutlery. 3446 Compositional information on some other grades of stainless steels used in food contact applications 3447 can be found in Outukumpu Stainless Corrosion Handbook (Outokumpu Stainless Corrosion Handbook 3448 11th edition 2015). 3449 Stainless steels used in contact with food 3450 The following food contact applications often use stainless steels: 3451 i. Containers for storage and transportation e.g. milk trucks, wine tanks. 3452 ii. Processing equipment used in industrial plants e.g. processing of fruit and vegetables, dry foods 3453 such as cereals, flour, sugar; fish processing; brew kettles and beer kegs, blenders and 3454 bread -dough mixers. 3455 iii. Processing equipment, as well as many fittings in catering facilities such as restaurants, hospitals 3456 and in industrial kitchens. 3457 iv. Slaughterhouse equipment. 3458 v. Household equipment e.g. electric kettles, cookware, kitchen fittings (sinks, counters and drains) as 3459 well as bowls, knives, spoons and forks. 3460 A wide range of stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion in acetic acid (concentration range 1 - 3461 20%) at temperatures up to boiling point (Outukumpu Stainless Corrosion Handbook, 11th edition 3462 2015). Similar corrosion resistance is seen for beer, citric acid (up to 5%), coffee, fruit juices, wines, 3463 lactic acid, milk and various detergents. It is well known that molybdenum improves the corrosion 3464 resistance of stainless steels in contact with foods or fluids that contain chloride ions. In Italy, stainless 3465 steels must meet certain release criteria in a var iety of media before they can be approved for food 3466 contact applications. The list of approved stainless steels includes the standard austenitic grades 304 3467 (18% Cr, 10% Ni) and 316 (17% Cr, 12% Ni+Mo). In addition, some European standards (e.g. EN 631, 3468 EN ISO 8442- 2) specify the finish quality of the products and their ability to meet test criteria, which 3469 minimises the likelihood of pitting or crevice corrosion occurring during the normal lifetime of the 3470 product. 3471 In addition to corrosion resistance, grade selection for food applications must also include 3472 consideration of durability, formability (e.g. deep drawing for pots and pans) and mechanical/physical 3473 properties (e.g. ferromagnetism for induction heating applications). Users of the Guide are 3474 recommended t o seek expert advice on the selection of suitable stainless steel grades for their specific 3475 food contact applications. 3476 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 108/134 Release 3477 Metal ion release from stainless steel is generally assumed to be a time dependent measure of metal 3478 transition. Tests have shown that metal release from stainless steel decreases with time (Mazinanian 3479 et al., 2016). Further information on these processes can be obtained from the literature cited below. 3480 Preparation of foodstuffs such as rhubarb, sauerkraut and red wine sauce in bran d new stainless steel 3481 cooking pots may cause chemical changes of the stainless steel surface. These changes can be 3482 regarded as the development of a protective layer that reduces further nickel release (B\u00fcnig -Pfaue et 3483 al., 1999). The amount of nickel derive d from food contact utensils in standard portions of various 3484 corrosive foodstuffs is 0-0.008 mg (Flint and Packirisamy, 1995). 3485 The highest rates of chromium and nickel release from saucepans were observed in new saucepans at 3486 first use (Flint and Packirisam y, 1997). Nickel and chromium release was tested with rhubarb, apricots, 3487 lemon marmalade, tomato chutney and boiled release of nickel was 0.21 mg/kg 3488 for apricots and 0.14 mg/kg for rhubarb after the first cooking operation. After the fifth cooking 3489 operation, the highest nickel release for apricots and rhubarb was reduced to approximately 0.06 3490 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. Correspondingly, the highest release of chromium after the fifth 3491 cooking operation was 0.04 mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. 3492 Using boiling 5% acidic acid as a simulant for 5 minutes in stainless steel pans, nickel release ranged 3493 between 0.08 and 0.21 mg/kg (Kuligowski, 1992). A study of the levels of nickel and chromium found 3494 in 11 habitual menus cooked in gla ss and stainless steel saucepans fall within or are close to the range 3495 of nickel and chromium contents of these foods reported in the literature (Accominotti, 1998). 3496 A review on the metal release from stainless steel in biological environments including fo od is 3497 available. (Hedberg et al, 2016) 3498 Safety aspects 3499 -- No particular health concerns have been raised, in terms of excessive intakes of nickel or chromium, 3500 by several studies of metal release in various media and of the uptake of metals by foods cooked in 3501 stainless steel pans. 3502 -- Special grades of stainless steels are available for use in applications (e.g. those involving contact 3503 with relatively high levels of chloride ions) where particular corrosion resistance characteristics are 3504 required. 3505 Compliance with specific release limits, as presented in these guidelines, will help to reduce health 3506 risks that may arise from the use of certain stainless steels that are not well known or that have not 3507 been individually tested. 3508 References 3509 Chambon, P., Vallon, J.J., (1998).

The 3591 results of specific release testing obtained in food shall prevail over the results obtained in food simulants. 3592 Criteria for the choice of test procedure 3593 To assess compliance (see Calculation of specific release), the material or article must be tested for the 3594 release of the relevant metals and impurities, either into foodstuffs or into food simulants, according to 3595 the following criteria. 3596 Testing release from materials and articles into foodstuffs 3597 Release from metallic materials and articles into foodstuffs is influenced by the properties of the material, 3598 the chemical and physical properties of the foodstuff, and ambient conditions such as thermal processing 3599 of filled containers, storage time and temperature and residual oxygen after sealing. 3600 To verify the compliance of materials or articles with the relevant SRLs, actual foodstuffs are tested or 3601 used in testing under actual conditions of application in the following cases: 3602 - when the material or article placed on the market i s already in contact with food (e.g. canned 3603 food, beer kegs, etc.) and as far as possible at end of shelf life. 3604 - when the material or article is not yet in contact with food, but the intended use for specified 3605 foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs is c learly indicated by the manufacturer or is undoubtedly recognised 3606 (e.g. food processing utensils such as garlic presses, tea infusers, etc.). 3607 - when harsh physical conditions or abrasion are expected to be encountered under normal use 3608 that cannot be reproduced when using liquid simulants (e.g. pepper mills, coffee grinders or other mills 3609 for nuts, cereals etc.). 3610 - when the natural metal content of the foodstuffs is capable of significantly influencing the 3611 analytical result. In this case, the choice of alternative representative foodstuffs must be scientifically 3612 justified. The natural metal content of the foodstuff should be considered and reported with the analytical 3613 result (see Natural metal content of the foodstuff). 3614 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 114/134 Testing release from material s and articles into food 3615 simulants 3616 Following from the guiding principles established by Resolution CM/Res(2020)9, food simulants are used 3617 instead of foodstuffs when release testing in food is not feasible or not practical, as described below: 3618 -the mater ial or article may come into contact with foodstuffs whose diversity cannot be included 3619 in a particular category of food (e.g. kitchen utensils or other articles at end -use level). 3620 - the intended use for specified foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs i s not clearly indicated or 3621 known. 3622 - the analysis is not technically possible or the specified foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs are 3623 not available. 3624 The food simulants and conditions of contact are selected in such a way that release is at least as high as 3625 into food. 3626 Articles for repeated use 3627 For materials or articles not yet in contact with food (i.e. non -packaging applications) but intended to 3628 come into repeated contact with foodstuffs, the release test(s) shall be carried out three times in 3629 succession. Between tests, samples are treated as described under \"Pre -treatment of materials and 3630 articles\". Where these instructions apply only to the first use or where the instructions indicate that no 3631 washing is required before or between uses, this must b e taken into account. 3632 Compliance is established on the findings from the third test. This takes account of the passivation process 3633 that some alloys or metals undergo. 3634 However, the sum of the results of the first and second tests should not exceed an expos ure equivalent 3635 to daily use for one week (i.e. seven times the SRL) according to the formula: 3636 RESULT1st test + RESULT2nd test 7 x SRL. 3637 This takes into account the overall acceptability of a food contact article. 3638 Care should be taken so that repeated u se articles made from plated metals or alloys are produced in such 3639 a way that the integrity of the plating is guaranteed throughout their lifetime. Such items should be 3640 labeled with a warning that in case of any defect, they may no longer be safe for use. 3641 Articles for repeated use, like hot beverage appliances (e.g. coffee machines), should be tested after any 3642 preparatory or cleaning steps (e.g. decalcification) stated within the corresponding instruction manual. 3643 Remark : 3644 Where relevant physical changes occ ur in the test specimen only under the specified test conditions but 3645 not under the worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article, the test must be adapted with 3646 alternative conditions that do not lead to the physical changes but still refle ct the worst foreseeable 3647 conditions of use. 3648 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 115/134 Sampling of materials and articles 3649 Sampling for analysis means taking an article, a material or an already packed food item in order to verify 3650 its compliance with the established requirements, such as relevant SRLs. 3651 Sampling should be performed at all stages of the supply chain for food contact materials. 3652 A sampling strategy should be defined, which allows an appropriate and representative sample of the 3653 production batch. The type, amount, size and characteristic properties of the sample should, as a 3654 minimum, be specified. 3655 The number of test specimens sampled and the sample size must be sufficient to perform repeat analyses 3656 and to confirm results in case of dispute. 3657 For each sampling effort, an appropriate samplin g protocol form should be prepared, which must be 3658 completed during the sampling exercise. In case of sampling for enforcement purposes replicate samples 3659 should be taken for primary analysis, disputes (in which case, analyses should be repeated) and 3660 confirm atory analyses (if results are challenged, analyses should be performed by different laboratories), 3661 unless such a procedure conflicts with the rules of member states as regards the rights of the food 3662 manufacturer. 3663 Packaging materials (e.g. cans) 3664 A sampling strategy should be developed in order to check batch compliance for packaging materials at 3665 the manufacturing or distribution stage, which should be reflected in the supporting documentation of 3666 any declaration of compliance. An example of sampling plan for this purpose is given in Table 1 and may 3667 be applied. Different sampling plans can be used; however, they should not be seen as substitute for 3668 effective process control (Commission Regulation (EC) No 2023/2006). 3669 Table 1. Number of packages or units to be sampled, depending on the batch size. 3670 Number of packages or units in the batch Number of packages or units to be sample d 1-59 at least 3 60-200 at least 5% > 200 10 3671 Materials and articles other than packaging materials (e.g. kitchen utensils) 3672 At least three replicated samples should be sampled. 3673 Competent authorities/inspectorates 3674 For market surveillance purposes (e.g. as part of a campaign), the number of samples and the sample size 3675 may differ from the sampling plan r eferred to above. 3676 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 116/134 Pre-treatment of materials and articles 3677 Any instructions provided by the manufacturer with regard to pre -treatment of the test specimens, such 3678 as cleaning, must be followed before release testing is performed. 3679 When washing is required and no detailed instructions are provided, test specimens should be washed 3680 with dishwashing soap/detergent in water (pH 6 -8.5, at a temperature of approximately 40 \u00b0C), then 3681 rinsed with tap-water and finally with distilled water or water of similar quality . They should be left to 3682 drain and dry. Any staining should be avoided. The surface to be tested must not be handled after 3683 cleaning. 3684 During the sample preparation, modification of the physical properties of the surface of the food contact 3685 material or artic le should be avoided, especially for metal-plated products. 3686 Release testing into foodstuffs 3687 Pre-treatment of materials and articles and handling between, where appropriate, is described under 3688 \"Pre -treatment of materials and articles\". 3689 If appropriate, tes t conditions may be selected using the times and temperatures set out under \"Release 3690 testing into food simulants\". However, these conditions for testing into food simulants could be 3691 inappropriate for food (e.g. causing deterioration/alteration of the food) . In such cases, the conditions of 3692 worst foreseeable real use should be selected. 3693 Selection of foodstuffs 3694 The material or article to be tested shall be brought into contact with the intended foodstuff, if available. 3695 Contact surface to volume ratio is imp ortant - whenever possible, tests should be performed with the 3696 real surface to volume ratio. 3697 If no particular foodstuff has been indicated, a representative foodstuff should be selected, especially one 3698 having an equivalent pH value and organic acid, salt, fat and alcohol content. The principle of reasonable 3699 worst -case circumstances of use shall be applied. For example, testing should be carried out in the 3700 presence of known corrosion accelerators, such as sulphur dioxide or nitrate, if these substances are 3701 reasonably foreseeable to be present in the foodstuff and at levels close to their typical upper limits. 3702 Where applicable, the representative foodstuff will be specified in the supporting documentation of any 3703 declaration of compliance and, if necessary, the initial concentration of the metal(s) before release 3704 testing. This is to ensure that the tests can be reproduced, if necessary. 3705 NOTE: Souci(1) (2016) provides Food Composition and Nutrition Tables that the reader may find helpful. 3706 For example, this refere nce identifies foodstuffs with the highest concentrations of typical organic acids. 3707 Natural metal content of the foodstuff 3708 There should be prior knowledge of the natural concentration of the metal(s) in the foodstuff to be tested. 3709 Therefore, the metal co ncentration in the foodstuff needs to be measured before and after contact with 3710 the metallic material or article. If available, information about the expected natural metal concentration 3711 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 117/134 and its variability (at least minimum - maximum values) in the foodst uff should be mentioned in the 3712 supporting documentation of any declaration of compliance. 3713 Testing of packaging materials 3714 Processing and packaging conditions * 3715 When checking compliance, test conditions should be as close as possible to actual processing a nd 3716 packaging conditions to avoid an over - or under -estimation of metal release. The presence of oxygen 3717 during the test, for example, may increase the release of iron and tin from tinplate cans or of aluminium 3718 from aluminium containers. Metal containers mus t be hermetically sealed (i.e. closed in such a way that 3719 air is prevented from entering or leaving the enclosure). 3720 If a vacuum is created in the container after sealing under actual packaging conditions, an equivalent 3721 vacuum should also be created in the t est packaging. 3722 If hot foodstuffs are packed into containers under industrial packaging conditions, then this should also 3723 be carried out for testing purposes. 3724 Storage conditions * 3725 Most hermetically closed metal containers for foodstuffs are used for produ cts with long shelf -lives that 3726 may, in some cases, extend up to 5 years. 3727 It is likely that the release of metals due to interactions between foodstuffs and the food contact surface 3728 of metal containers will continue throughout the shelf -life of the product. The increase in the 3729 concentration of metals in packed foodstuffs may not be linear in all cases. Therefore, it is not possible to 3730 accurately predict the concentration of the metal at the end of the shelf -life based on measurements 3731 taken only after storage for a short time. 3732 Consequently, it is advisable to store the test specimens under actual storage conditions for its entire 3733 shelf -life. 3734 If rapid test results are needed, metal release can be accelerated by using more challenging storage 3735 conditions, for example, higher temperatures, regular shaking of the container, or alternating between 3736 hot and cold storage. The extrapolation of these data must be justified by comparison with data obtained 3737 under normal conditions. For example, after verification of their applicability (scientifically validated), the 3738 contact time and temperature tables reported in Regulation (EU) No 10/2011, Annex V, could be used. 3739 The information on any accelerated testing must be mentioned in the supporting documentation of any 3740 declaratio ns of compliance. 3741 * These conditions may be suitable for manufacturers, while competent authorities may not be able to replicate industrial conditions. Thus, comparison of their respective results may not be possible. DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 118/134 Determination of metals in the foodstuff 3742 The metal concentration in the foodstuff can usually be determined using the same analytical methods as 3743 for the determination of metal concentrations in food simulants. Individual digestion condi tions and 3744 particular measures to avoid matrix interferences may be required. In the case of any special sample 3745 treatment, a thorough description of instrumental conditions must be included in the test report. 3746 Test results and conclusions 3747 The release of a particular metal from a metallic food contact material or article (SR) into foodstuffs can 3748 be determined by subtracting the concentration of the element in the foodstuff before contact with the 3749 metal/alloy (C 0) from the concentration of the element in th e foodstuff after contact with the metal/alloy 3750 (C1): 3751 SR = C 1 - C0 [mg Me/kg food] or in [ mg into food simulants 3753 Food simulants 3754 As it is not always possible to test release from food contact materials and articles into actual foodstuffs, 3755 food simulants have been introduced that share certain characteristics with one or more food types. In 3756 practice, various mixtures of food types ar e possible, for instance fatty and aqueous foods. 3757 Taking into account sound scientific knowledge, tests conducted in the context of this Technical Document 3758 and the principle of reasonable worst -case conditions of use, testing on the following food simulan ts is 3759 recommended: 3760 Table 2 . Food and food simulants. 3761 Type of food Simulant Aqueous or alcoholic or fatty food Artificial tap water EN16889* Acidic foods (pH 4.5) acid 0.5% (m/v)** 3762 * EN 16889:2016 Food hygiene(3) - Production and dispense of hot beverages from hot beverage 3763 appliances - Hygiene requirements, migration test. Approximate ion concentrations: calcium 16.4 mg/L, 3764 magnesium 3.3 mg/L, 28.4 mg/L, sulphate 13 mg/L 0.1M NaOH or 0.1M HNO 3. 3766 ** Prepared by dissolving 5 g of citric acid monohydrate (CAS No. 5949 -29-1) in distilled water and diluting 3767 to final volume of 1 L. 3768 Any other food simulant, cons idered to be more suitable for testing, can be used provided that its use is 3769 either based on scientific data or verified by appropriate experimentation. 3770 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 119/134 Distilled water at the same temperature as the test material should be added regularly during testing t o 3771 replace the quantity of food simulant lost by evaporation. 3772 To cover (close) a receptacle when it has no lid, an appropriate covering (e.g. fluoroplastic film) may be 3773 placed on top. Containers that have a cover should be closed as under actual conditions. 3774 Articles that can be filled 3775 Kitchenware articles and other articles that can be filled (e.g. cans) should be filled with the food simulant 3776 to approximately total capacity and then suitably covered to reduce evaporation. The same volume (or 3777 mass) of fo od or simulant must be used for replicate analysis and this volume (or mass) must be reported. 3778 A distinction between use at ambient temperature, cold fill (e.g. for salads) and uses that include hot fills 3779 or boiling liquids should be made. 3780 Kitchenware sho uld be tested under actual conditions of use (temperature, time, volume or mass) or by 3781 applying the test conditions as specified in the JRC Guidelines on testing conditions for kitchenware 3782 articles in contact with foodstuffs(2). The temperature refers to t he temperature of the simulant at the 3783 surface in contact with the article. 3784 Articles other than kitchenware should be also tested under actual conditions of use; however, if not 3785 practical (e.g. 2 years at room temperature for cans or even longer time), ot her testing conditions can be 3786 used after describing the rationale behind the selection of the testing conditions. 3787 Due to practical limitations, these conditions do not apply to large volume equipment such as pipes and 3788 tanks. 3789 Articles that cannot be filled 3790 A. Articles that cannot be filled and for which it is impractical to estimate the ratio of surface area 3791 to the amount of foodstuff in contact with it 3792 Test conditions for articles including cutlery and cooking utensils such as colanders, potato mashers and 3793 cheese graters: 3794 The article should be tested, intact, by immersion to a reasonable depth reflecting normal use of the 3795 article (see Annex I for a detailed procedure). 3796 For the purpose of the test, contact times and temperatures should reproduce the intended and worst 3797 foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article (see JRC Guidelines on testing conditions(2)). 3798 B. Materials and articles at the end-use level that cannot be filled other than A such as baking 3799 sheets, foils 3800 This applies to materials and articles such as aluminium foil (e.g. chocolate bar wrapped in aluminium 3801 foil), cutting boards, kitchen sinks with draining boards and kitchen countertops. 3802 Either the entire article or a test specimen of it can be tested by im mersion of the relevant surfaces 3803 intended for contact with food. In the latter case, the total area of the test specimen should be at least 1 3804 dm\u00b2, determined with a measurement precision of 1 mm for each side. Only the food contact surface is 3805 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 120/134 taken into ac count when determining the specific release value. The areas of cut edges are taken into 3806 account only if their thickness exceeds 2 mm. 3807 As an alternative to testing by immersion, a test cell can be used for samples of flat (non fillable) articles. 3808 The samp le is mounted to the test cell with the food contact surface facing towards the foodstuff or food 3809 simulant. 3810 Testing conditions should be selected as described above for articles that can be filled. 3811 Test cells can be used if the applicable test conditions a s described in the JRC guideline are met (2). 3812 Test cells should be as close as possible to being inert with respect to the applied foodstuffs or food 3813 simulants. A blank test must be performed in order to measure a potential release of metals caused by 3814 the test cell itself. In the blank configuration, an inert sheet that does not release any metals should be 3815 used in the place of the sample. The results of the blank test have to be subtracted from the results of 3816 release tests with sample material. 3817 Edge prepa ration for stainless steel articles : 3818 The procedure for preparing the edges of stainless steel test specimens which have been cut from larger 3819 surfaces or articles involves appropriate polishing. For example, the stainless steel surface may be 3820 polished under water using SiC 1200 paper to round off the edges without damaging the adjacent surface. 3821 After polishing, the article must be washed with special care so that no contaminants (such as metal 3822 particles) are left on the surface of the sample. Finally, the sa mple should be left for at least 24 hours in a 3823 clean and dry area so that the passive layer can re -form naturally. 3824 Test conditions : 3825 The Guidelines issued by the JRC on testing conditions for kitchenware articles(2) specify the testing time 3826 and temperature for a wide variety of kitchenware articles. For example: 3827 - For cutting boards, short -term contact with hot foodstuffs is assumed. Therefore, the test should 3828 be performed for 2 hours at 70 \u00b0C. 3829 - For articles such as counter -tops, where ambient temperature long-term contact is assumed, 3830 testing conditions should be 10 days at 40 \u00b0C. 3831 - For articles such as baking foil, the testing conditions should be 2 hours at 100 \u00b0C. 3832 C. Food processing appli ances 3833 This applies to articles such as coffee makers, juicers, dispensing equipment, electric kettles and meat 3834 mincers, as well as accessories. 3835 Test conditions : 3836 The articles (or their component parts reasonably likely to be in contact with food) should be tested under 3837 conditions of use according to the instructions of the manufacturers. 3838 For hot beverage appliances, testing should be performed in accordance with EN 16889(3) 3839 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 121/134 Methods of analysis 3840 Methods of analysis used for release testing of food contac t materials and articles must comply with the 3841 provisions of Annex III (Characterisation of methods of analysis) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625. Laboratories 3842 performing analysis must use validated methods for the determination of metals and other elements 3843 acco rding to the guidelines and criteria specifically set out by the EURL -NRL FCM Network (EUR 24105(5), 3844 2009), as revised. 3845 Scope 3846 The methods for the determination of elements released from metals and alloys into foodstuffs and 3847 simulants. 3848 Principle 3849 The concen tration of an element in a foodstuff or food simulant is determined by an instrumental method 3850 of analysis that fulfils the performance criteria described below. 3851 Homogenisation and digestion of food samples 3852 Food samples should be homogenised and digested wi th mineral acid using an appropriate method, while 3853 avoiding any contamination or loss of material. 3854 When removing foodstuff from articles, abrasion of the tested surfaces must be avoided, and only non - 3855 metal household utensils (plastic spoon, wooden scraper) should be used. 3856 Preparation of test specimens of materials or articles 3857 See under \"Pre -treatment of materials and articles\". 3858 Quality of reagents : 3859 All reagents and solvents must be of analytical quality, unless otherwise specified. 3860 Water must be distilled or distilled, deionised(4), or water of similar quality. 3861 Quality and preparation of analytical equipment 3862 Test vessels and storage containers made of low -density polyethylene disposable material or 3863 quartz shall be used. High -density polyethylene (HDP E) is also acceptable, while polypropylene (PP) is 3864 acceptable after verification. 3865 Fluoroplastics are recommended where necessary, but care should be taken when using 3866 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), because of reported interactions with metals. Before using PTFE labware, 3867 tests should verify that absorption of metals in their surface at the conditions applied is negligible. 3868 NOTE: Quartz containers should always be used in preference to glass. If the use of glassware 3869 cannot be avoided, it should be carefull y decontaminated before use. Blank measurements should verify 3870 effective decontamination. 3871 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 122/134 All equipment used for the preparation and execution of immersion experiments should be acid 3872 cleaned with 10% HNO 3 for a minimum of 24 h and then carefully rinsed with ultra -pure water before use 3873 to minimise the risk of contamination of metals. Finally, the equipment must be dry when used. 3874 Instruments 3875 NOTE: Analytical instruments and equipment are specified only when necessary; otherwise, 3876 standard laboratory equipment may be used. 3877 Appropriate analytical methods should be employed, using instruments such as: 3878 - Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS) (ICP MS) 3882 Other methods may be used, such as polarography, specific electrodes, etc. providing that the 3883 analytica l performance described below are as far as possible achieved. 3884 Blank tests 3885 A blank test must be performed to determine the initial concentration of the element in the 3886 homogenised/digested foodstuff or simulant prior to contact with the material or articl e under study. A 3887 blank test must be carried out for each series of tests. 3888 Analytical performance requirements 3889 For the determination of metallic elements in foodstuffs or food simulants, laboratories must use 3890 a validated analytical method that fulfils the performance criteria indicated below, whenever possible. 3891 The limit of detection is defined as the concentration of the element in the blank sample that gives 3892 a signal equal to three times the background noise of the instrument. 3893 The limit of quantifica tion is defined as the concentration of the element in the foodstuff or 3894 simulant that gives a signal equal to six times the background noise of the instrument. 3895 As far as possible: 3896 1. Limit of detection (LOD) < 1/10 SRL 3897 2. Limit of quantification (LO Q) < 1/5 SRL 3898 3. Recovery rate from 80% to 120% 3899 4. The within -laboratory standard deviation for repeated analysis of a reference or fortified 3900 material, under conditions of reproducibility (intermediate precision), should not exceed the level 3901 calculated by the Horwitz Equation (see Table 3). 3902 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 123/134 Table 3. Predicted value for within-laboratory RSD, under conditions of reproducibility, depending 3903 on concentration (5) 3904 Analyte % Analyte ratio Unit (%) 100 ppb 22.6 5. Specificity: as far as possible free from matrix and spectral interferences 3905 The Guidelines for performance criteria and validation procedures of analytical methods used in controls 3906 of food contact materials (5) should be taken into account. 3907 Measurements and reporting 3908 The analytical results for test specimens sampled (see Sampling of materials and articles) and tested for 3909 release in a foodstuff or food simulant, with the measurements corrected for recovery, should be reported 3910 in mg Me/kg or mg Me/dm2, with their expanded uncertainty and the analytical method. 3911 A test specimen can b e considered compliant when the concentrations of any released elements (or the 3912 average concentration, in the case of replicate instrumental measurements, of the same test specimen 3913 solution after the release testing) do not exceed the corresponding SRLs, t aking into account the expanded 3914 uncertainty of the measurements (see Calculation of specific release). 3915 Usually, more than one specimen of the same sample are tested (see Sampling of materials and articles). 3916 Only if all the test specimens of the sample are compliant, the sample is considered compliant. 3917 In case of single use materials or articles, the results after the first migration test are used for compliance 3918 statement. 3919 In case of repeated use materials or articles, the results after the third migration test are used for 3920 compliance statement. However, the sum of the results of the first and second migration tests should not 3921 exceed seven times the SRL (see Articles for repeated use). 3922 For articles that cannot be filled and for which it is impractical to estimate the ratio of surface area to the 3923 amount of foodstuff in contact with, the specific release is calculated according to the rules set in the 3924 Annex I. The correspondin g envelope volume must be reported. 3925 For articles that consist of separate parts (including accessories) and for which the ratio of surface area to 3926 volume or amount of foodstuff in contact is not known for the assembled article, the total mass of any 3927 given released element must be calculated for all the individual parts that come in contact with food. 3928 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 124/134 This total mass of released elements must be converted in mg/kg by taking into account the amount of 3929 foodstuff coming into contact with the assembled article. 3930 Examples: mincer / meat slicer / espresso machine 3931 3932 For silver or silver -plated cutlery, a reduction factor may be applied to the specific release of silver when 3933 justified (see Annex II). 3934 Calculation of specific release (SR) 3935 When the foodstuff or food simulant used for the release test contains amounts of the element under 3936 investigation (see \"Natural metal content of the food\"), the original metal content must be subtracted 3937 from the result of the release test. 3938 SR = C 1 - C0 3939 where SR is the conce ntration of the element that is released from the metal or alloy into the 3940 foodstuff/food simulant, expressed Me/dm2]; 3941 C1 is the concentration of the element in the foodstuff/food simulant after contact with the metal/alloy, 3942 expressed and 3943 C0 is the concentration of the element in the foodstuff/food simulant before contact with the metal/alloy, 3944 3945 Note: The measurement uncertainty of the release t est result must be taken into account to assess 3946 compliance. 3947 Example: 3948 Assuming 3949 C0 Me/kg 3950 C1 = mg Me/kg, u(C 1) mg Me/kg 3951 where, u(C 1) and u(C 0) are the respective standard measurement uncertainties, one gets: 3952 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 125/134 SR = C 1 - C0 = 8 - 2 = 6 mg Me/kg 3953 U(SR) = 2 * (1)2+(0)2=2 0.42+1.62 = 3.3 mg Me/kg 3954 where, U(SR) is the expanded uncertainty, calculated using a coverage factor (k) of 2, and applying the 3955 law of uncertainty propagation according to JCGM 100L2008 GUM 1995(a) 3956 The final result should be reported as SR = 6.0 \u00b1 3.3 (k=2) mg Me/kg. 3957 This approach is applicable when C 0 and C 1 are expressed in mg Me/dm2. The final result should then be 3958 multiplied (b) by \"6\" to obtain a result expressed in mg Me/kg.

The following method provi des conventions to be used for a direct and simple 4000 calculation of the specific release in mg/kg as it relates to the consumer's exposure. For each three - 4001 dimensional object, the lengths of its three dimensions (X = depth, Y = width, Z = height) are defined using 4002 a few simple conventions. This yields a rectangular box parallelepiped (simple geometric figure) enclosing 4003 the object called \"envelope volume\" which is used as a reference in the method for the amount of food 4004 that comes into contact with an article. 4005 This method deviates from the method currently described in the European Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 4006 on plastic materials and it is proposed as more appropriate for a number of utensils whose surface area 4007 is not correlated with the amount of food in conta ct and therefore consumer exposure. 4008 Measurements for the calculation of the envelope volume of the 4009 utensil 4010 In order not to drastically underestimate the contact volume for articles with small dimensions along one 4011 or more of the axes, the minimum value that can be assigned to each axis (X, Y and Z) is 5 cm. Each value 4012 below 5 cm will be rounded to 5 cm. 4013 Beyond the minimum value of 5 cm, the length of each axis shall be measured and expressed in increments 4014 of 1 mm. 4015 Determination of dimensions along the axes X, Y and Z 4016 4017 4018 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 128/134 Diagram 1 illustrates the three -dimensional envelop volume, where the Z axis represents the height of 4019 the utensil, the X axis its depth and the Y axis its width (Y). 4020 Measure the value of the total height (H total) for the utensil using a ga uge (e.g. Vernier calipers) with a 4021 precision of 1 mm. The height shall be established by measuring by in straight line along the centreline of 4022 the utensil, as illustrated below. 4023 Remark: 4024 If it is not clear what points should be used to determine the height measurement, the utensil can be 4025 suspended (i.e. allowed to hang freely from the highest point of the handle and then lowered until it 4026 touches a horizontal surface e.g. a desktop). The height is then be measured from the highest point of the 4027 utensil perpendicular to the horizontal surface. 4028 Then determine what portion to the total height (H total) for the utensil is assigned, respectively, to the 4029 handle ( Hhandle ) and to the part necessarily in contact with food ( Hn). 4030 Measure the length of the handle (Hhandle ) using the gauge. If the handle is made of metal and it is not 4031 clearly separate from the rest of the article, it is assigned a default length of 1/3 of total height. Then 4032 measure the part necessarily in contact with food ( Hn). 4033 Afterwards measure the dept h (along the X axis) and the width (along the Y axis) parallel to the horizontal 4034 surface using the same orientation of the utensil as described above. 4035 Calculate the height (Z) of the utensil as shown in the following flow diagram defining the height (Z) of 4036 utensils: 4037 4038 4039 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 129/134 4040 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 130/134 4041 4042 Deviation from the aforementioned process 4043 Articles that cannot be filled may have a shape or may be used in a way, which makes them unsuitable to 4044 apply the aforementioned calculation process 4045 Examples are depicted here 4046 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 131/134 4047 In such cases an appropriate adaption of the calculation is necessary. This has to be mentioned in the 4048 report along with a justification of the deviation. 4049 Calculation of the envelope volume 4050 Once the rectangular box has been constructed, calculate the envelope v olume as follows: 4051 Envelope volume = X \u00d7 Y \u00d7 Z (cm\u00b3) 4052 If any of the used values is below 5 cm it shall be rounded to 5 cm. 4053 Determination of the reference mass (RW) 4054 Determine the reference mass with respect to the envelope volume using the following form ula: 4055 RW (kg) = potato masher: 16 .0 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 8.7 = 1322 reference mass = 1 .322 kg 4058 - skimmer: 5 \u00d7 14 .2 \u00d7 18 .0 = 1278 reference mass = 1 .278 kg 4059 - small ice cream scoop: 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 12 .8 = 320 referenc e mass = 0.320 kg 4060 Determination of the released mass of a specific element 4061 Immerse the article up to the height of Z in a known volume of food simulant at the temperature 4062 and for the duration recommended in Chapter 3. 4063 This volume is not necessarily the same as the envelope volume. It may be larger (depending on 4064 availability of glassware sizes) or smaller (to maximise the concentration and therefore reduce the 4065 practical limit of detection) for reasons of laboratory practice. Nevertheless, whenever po ssible, large 4066 volume deviations should be avoided. If in the experimental set -up the simulant does not cover the 4067 article's surface up to the level of the calculated Z, appropriate considerations should allow to add to the 4068 release the relative contribution from the handle (if made of the same material). 4069 Once the specific element has been released and its concentration in the food simulant has been 4070 measured, calculate the released mass of the specific element. 4071 Released mass (M) = V \u00d7 C 4072 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles, 2nd edition 132/134 where, V is the volume of simulant used, expressed in L 4073 C is the concentration of the element in the food simulant after contact with the metal/alloy, expressed 4074 in [mg Me/L]. 4075 Determination of the specific release 4076 As a general rule: SR = M/RW 4077 where, SR is the concentration of the element that is released from the metal or alloy into the food 4078 simulant, expressed in [mg Me/kg food simulant]. 4079 DRAFT FOR CONSUL TATION - Metals and Alloys used in food contact materials and articles , 2nd edition 133/134 Annex I I: Correction factor applied when comparing release 4080 test results for cutlery made from silver or silver -plated 4081 cutlery with release limits for silver 4082 Recent data from official control laboratories have shown that the release of silver ions from cutlery 4083 made from silver or silver -plated cutlery tested with citric acid under conditions for hot use (FSI/CAH1 4084 of the JRC Guideline 7) may exceed t he release limit set for silver. Furthermore, testing under these 4085 conditions does not adequately represent real use conditions and consumer exposure. 4086 After considering the following arguments: 4087 a) The analysis of silver in real food is challenging and ofte n error -prone, possibly leading to 4088 results that underestimate the release. This may account for the absence, up to the present 4089 time, of any reliable comparison between silver release into food simulants and into real food. 4090 Therefore, it seems more appropri ate to test with citric acid as a simulant. However, as tests 4091 using citric acid simulant at high temperatures tend to overestimate (based on available data) 4092 the release of silver ions from silver compared to worst foreseeable real use, the test result 4093 may have to be corrected. 4094 b) Hot served acidic food represents only a small fraction of the daily food consumption. Even 4095 though there are no reliable data available on the consumption of hot acidic food with cutlery, 4096 it is safe to assume, that the amount of that particular type of food is less than the overall 4097 food consumption. 4098 c) Cutlery made of silver is rare and precious and, therefore, predominantly reserved for use 4099 on special occasions - a period ranging from a few special or red-letter days (celebrations, 4100 holidays) per year t o once or twice a week (e. g. on the weekend). A factor derived from this 4101 timeframe could vary from 3.5 (a weekend, twice a week), or 7 (once a week) to as high as 4102 365 (use only once a year). Taking into consideration only the highest possible frequencies of 4103 use (e.g. once or twice a week) an average factor of 5 would result. 4104 d) The WHO considered 0.39 mg/person/day as the NOAEL , which was also taken into 4105 consideration by EFSA. The SRL for silver was derived based on intake data using criterion 3 (i) 4106 of th e criteria for establishing SRLs, leading to an SRL of 0.08 mg/kg (which would contribute 4107 to 1/5th of the NOAEL). Considering new analytical data for cutlery which indicate that it is not 4108 in every case feasible to comply with the limit set and therefore, it may be appropriate to take 4109 technically feasible levels (ALARA) into account. At the present time, only few data exist and, 4110 until more reliable data exist , an SRL based on ALARA cannot be derived. 4111 It was concluded that a correction factor to be applied to the test results for cutlery made from silver 4112 or silver -plated cutlery is justified. 4113 7 Senaldi C., P. and Hoekstra E.
