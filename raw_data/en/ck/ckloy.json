For a healthy life the individual health of each of these components are important. Ayurveda describes health as an equilibrium state of Dosha, Agni, Dhathu, the excretory processes and the contented state of Atma (Spirit), Indriyas (Senses), and Mana (mind). Hence health can be considered as a condition wherein your body, mind, and spirit are in a natural state of harmony. The health of an individual doesn't merely mean physical health but also that of mind and Spirit. The derangement of any of these factors is considered as a disease. The treatment or process of attaining the natural state of harmony and the state of wellness is termed as healing. Ayurveda explains the treatment of spirit as Daivavyapasraya, that of mind as Satvavajaya and of the body as Yukthi vyapasraya. Spirituality can be explained as something related to the spirit / Atma. Atma can be classified as Paramatma and Jeevatma. Paramatma is the supreme soul or life force pervading all over the universe. Jeevatma is the life force that is a part of Paramatma confined to a particular being. Jeevatma is nothing but yourself or the inner core of your very existence. By the Jeevatma only one is aware of his or her existence. Jeevatma witnesses all the happenings with the help of the mind. Mind enjoys or understands the outer world through the senses. Jeevatma is considered as continuously nourished by Paramatma. Healing happens only in a living being with a spirit. It never happens in a dead or a being without spirit. In other words, healing is a regenerative or creative process happening only in the presence of spirit. Keeping the mind focuse on the spirit or in a relaxed state helps to heal. Spiritual practices help in this process. Spiritual practices apart from helping to achieve a relaxed & focused mind, it also helps to nourish the Jeevatma and in spiritual progress. These spiritual practices are needed for both healthy and unhealthy. It is more essential for healthy than unhealthy to keep their body, mind, and spirit devoid of any disease or unnatural changes. Ultimately the healer lies inside your within. When one strengthens this healer automatically the healing happens. Spiritual practices are necessary for strengthening the spirit. It boosts the healing process, regulates your emotions, creates a positive outlook on life, and helps to attain a better quality of life. It also helps to know about one's self, the universe, recognize that we are a part of the divine nature. The spiritual practices include Pranayama, Japa (chanting hymns or mantra), meditation, Yogic postures, prayers etc. When spiritual healing happens it will help both the physical and mental healing which helps to attain the ultimate goal of Ayurveda of attaining complete health.
