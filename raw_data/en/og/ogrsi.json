Prince Edward Island is currently administering three approved COVID-19 vaccines, including (click on each vaccine link to learn more about how the vaccine protects against COVID-19, how it is administered and what to expect after receiving the vaccine): Every Island resident 5 years of age and older who wants to be immunized against COVID-19 will receive an opportunity to receive the vaccine in 2021. Health Canada recently authorized the use of the Novavax Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 12 years of age and older. This is a recombinant protein subunit vaccine and a new option for individuals who have been unable or prefer not to receive an mRNA or viral vector COVID-19 vaccine. The primary series includes 2 doses given 8 weeks apart. There are currently no specific NACI recommendations regarding the number of doses of Novavax Nuvaxovid for immunocompromised individuals. Prince Edward Island dose not have any supply of the Novavax Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine at the moment. Vaccine Approval The Government of Canada has signed advance purchase agreements with seven vaccine manufacturers that are in various stages of developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Some of these are in earlier phases of clinical trials where the safety of the vaccines is being accessed, while others are in the final phase of clinical trials where they must demonstrate effectiveness. If a vaccine has favourable results from this phase, manufacturers can request Health Canada approval. It is important to note that all COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of the manufacturer, are following the same process and protocols for approval - no steps have been skipped in the process for reviewing and approving these vaccines. Only vaccines that undergo the rigorous assessment and approval by Health Canada can be offered in Canada. Vaccine Safety Like all vaccines, Health Canada reviews the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that will be used throughout the country. A vaccine must go through this process successfully before it can be used. Like all other provinces and territories, Prince Edward Island will receive vaccines from several manufacturers and each vaccine will have to go through the same approval process. Since they are new, the COVID-19 vaccines will undergo more rigorous monitoring for any reactions or adverse events. Vaccine Side-Effects Like with other vaccines, side-effects from the COVID-19 vaccine are expected and are similar to what you may experience with other others, such as the influenza vaccine (flu shot). People who receive the vaccine may experience mild or moderate side-effects such as pain where the vaccine was injected, tiredness, muscle aches, headache, chills or a mild fever as the body begins to respond to the vaccine and build immunity. Vaccine Dosage The initial vaccines that will be available to Prince Edward Island will require a person to receive two doses. This means every person vaccinated will need to get a second dose up to 4 months after their first dose (current recommendation is 8 weeks after their first dose). Vaccine Rollout COVID-19 vaccines are available to all PEI residents 6 months of age and older. "}
