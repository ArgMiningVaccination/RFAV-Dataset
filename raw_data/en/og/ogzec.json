Every day, you react to situations that occur, thoughts you have, and worries about the past or future. It becomes easy to obsess over things that you cannot control and can interfere with your recovery during treatment at a rehabilitation program. Mindfulness is about allowing yourself to experience life as it happens and all the things you feel-the good and the bad-without judgment. Instead of becoming anxious about thoughts you cannot control, mindfulness lets you experience those thoughts and acknowledge them as natural. Your progression through treatment can mean identifying and processing traumas and overwhelming emotional situations. Mindfulness helps you stay calm and focused while doing those things. "}
