Ketamine is only legal for medical use in the U.S. and we do not recommend or condone recreational ketamine use. Patients should speak to their doctor if they are considering ketamine therapy. Mindbloom is an online platform that connects patients to doctors that are licensed to provide ketamine therapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression. The brand proudly proclaims on their website that \"psychedelic medicine is here,\" and that patients can use their service to \"achieve your breakthrough\" with \"guided experiences to help combat anxiety and depression.\" But is ketamine therapy actually proven in clinical research to reduce anxiety and depression? Is it safe? How much does it cost? And how do real users describe the effects of Mindbloom? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we review clinical research on ketamine to give our take on whether or not it's likely to be effective for improving mental health. We'll also review safety and side effect data on ketamine use, explain the price of Mindbloom and how it compares to other ketamine therapy providers, and share real, unsponsored user reviews of this service. Can Ketamine Treat Depression and Anxiety? A [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30922101/) published in The American Journal of Psychiatry tested ketamine for depression, and compared how effective the treatment is against a pharmaceutical antidepressant. The researchers found that one single ketamine infusion was more effective than the pharma drug, and sustained infusions (3x weekly over the course of 2 weeks) provided additional benefit. 59% of depressed patients experienced a symptom reduction greater than 50% after ketamine infusions. This study was sponsored by a Canadian university so there are no funding bias concerns. A 2020 [meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324515/) assessed results from many clinical trials on ketamine and depression, and found the therapy to be effective in reducing average depression scores. The reviewers noted that ketamine therapy was especially effective for patients who didn't respond to pharmaceutical antidepressants. As we documented in our [ketamine therapy](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/ketamine-therapy) review, this psychedelic has also been studied for the treatment of anxiety disorders. A 2020 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31526207/) tested ketamine therapy on patients with treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. This refers to anxiety that does not respond to pharmaceutical medication. Ketamine therapy was found to be more effective than placebo for anxiety, and that the anxiety improvements after ketamine therapy persisted for up to one week after a single treatment. Another [medical study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29561204/) on ketamine for anxiety found similar results. Patients with treatment resistant anxiety or social anxiety disorder (SAD) were administered weekly injections of ketamine for 3 months. 18 of the 20 patients studied reported significant reductions in anxiety, and \"marked improvements in functionality and in their personal lives.\" We will conclude from the available research that ketamine therapy is effective for the treatment of both depression and anxiety, although the medical backing for ketamine as an antidepressant is more impressive in our opinion. What Does a Ketamine Therapy Treatment Look Like? The YouTube channel Bustle published a video of someone with anxiety using ketamine in a clinical setting. The video documents the preparation that's required, shows what ketamine use in a medical setting looks like and provides an update on whether the drug was effective for relieving the patient's anxiety: Real, Unsponsored Mindbloom User Reviews The video below is published by a YouTube creator named \"GetBOLD! with Stacey\" who used Mindbloom. She describes her experience preparing for the ketamine therapy as well as the \"trip\" experience: A TikTok creator named \"jules.pools\" describes the visual hallucinations she experienced at a Mindbloom therapy session: [@jules.pools]The experience of physician prescribed ketamine therapy through Mindbloom. I experience visuals, which is rare. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only, talk to a doctor or psychiatrist about which treatments are right for you. In my opinion this is a very profound therapy I've tried. I am not a doctor and I'm not suggesting that everyone try this treatment. [#ketaminetherapy] [#therapy] [ original sound - Jules] How Much Does Mindbloom Cost? Mindbloom does not accept insurance, but some of the treatment costs can be reimbursed depending on the insurer. The brand's [Pricing](https://www.mindbloom.com/pricing) page provides codes that patients can use to check with their health insurance company about whether these bills can be fully or partially reimbursed after treatment. The initial program cost is currently $1,158. This includes 6 ketamine treatments, 2 psychiatric clinician consults and unlimited messaging. Fixed price installments are available. A renewal costs $768 and includes 6 ketamine treatments, 1 psychiatric clinician consult and unlimited messaging. These costs are actually quite reasonable for retail prices without considering insurance. For a comparative example, a website called [Ketamine Clinics Directory](https://ketamineclinicsdirectory.com/) documents prices from clinics across the U.S., and the average price appears to be over $300 per infusion. The average price per infusion with Mindbloom is only $193 and also includes unlimited messaging and other perks. This is cheaper than any of the ketamine treatment centers on the above-linked directory at the time of writing this article. Will Mindbloom Cause Side Effects? Ketamine therapy does cause side effects in some patients. The most common side effects of ketamine are psychiatric (mental) rather than physical, since it's a hallucinogenic drug. A 2019 [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6717708/) on ketamine for depression documented that \"acute psychiatric\" side effects were described in 38% of studies, and 72% of studies referenced dissociative side effects. Heart rate and blood pressure can increase with ketamine use, and headache and dizziness can also be experienced. Researchers have noted that the safety of short-term ketamine use is well-documented, but long-term safety data is lacking. We hope that in the future more long-term trials emerge testing whether ketamine can be used as a standalone antidepressant for months-to-years. This side effect profile is favorable in comparison to the side effect profile of many prescription medications for anxiety and depression in our opinion. Interview With Mindbloom Founder A YouTube channel called \"Aaron Watson Business\" interviewed Mindbloom's founder Dylan Beynon. He compares Mindbloom to other ketamine providers, the origin story of the business, and how the community of ketamine therapy users can impact further mental health improvements. It's an insightful interview that's worth a watch for anyone considering Mindbloom therapy in our opinion: Can Tea Naturally Induce Relaxation? There are several types of tea which are actually clinically shown to help drinkers relax. Green tea was shown in a 2017 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566632/) to significantly reduce stress levels, and has been used to promote mental and physical wellness for centuries.
