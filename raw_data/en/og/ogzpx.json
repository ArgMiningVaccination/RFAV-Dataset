Recent surveys found that an increasing number of parents are concerned that infants receive toomany vaccines. Implicit in this concern is that the infant'simmune system is inadequately developed to handle vac-cines safely or that multiple vaccines may overwhelm the immune system. In this review, we will examine thefollowing: 1) the ontogeny of the active immune responseand the ability of neonates and young infants to respondto vaccines; 2) the theoretic capacity of an infant's im-mune system; 3) data that demonstrate that mild or mod-erate illness does not interfere with an infant's ability togenerate protective immune responses to vaccines; 4)how infants respond to vaccines given in combinationcompared with the same vaccines given separately; 5)data showing that vaccinated children are not more likely to develop infections with other pathogens than unvac- cinated children; and 6) the fact that infants actuallyencounter fewer antigens in vaccines today than they did40 or 100 years ago.

One hundred years ago, children received 1 vaccine (the smallpox vaccine). Forty years ago, children received 5 vaccines routinely (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and smallpoxvaccines) and as many as 8 shots by 2 years of age. Today, children receive 11 vaccines routinely and asmany as 20 shots by 2 years of age (Table 1). The increased number of vaccines given to children andthe increased percentage of children receiving vac-cines have resulted in a dramatic decrease in thenumber of vaccine-preventable diseases. Most youngparents today have never seen many of the diseasesthat vaccines prevent. As a possible consequence ofthese trends, recent national surveys found that 23%of parents questioned the number of shots recom-mended for their children, 1and 25% were concerned that vaccines might weaken the immune system.1 Because most parents receive information and rec- ommendations about vaccines from their doctors,2 and because these recommendations carry substan- tial weight with parents,3,4providers must be knowl - edgeable when addressing parents' concerns. This article will provide health care professionals with information about the effect of vaccines on the in-fant's immune system and the capacity of the im- mune system to respond safely to multiple vaccines. A BRIEF SUMMARY OF NEONATAL AND INFANT IMMUNE RESPONSES The Neonatal Immune System Neonates develop the capacity to respond to for- eign antigens before they are born. B and T cells are present by 14 weeks' gestation and express an enor-mous array of antigen-specific receptors. 5Although the fetal immune system has the potential to respondto large numbers of foreign antigens, few foreignantigens are present in utero, and cells of the im-mune system are, therefore, primarily \"na \u00a8ve\" at birth. Passively Acquired Immunity The neonate is, in part, protected against disease by maternal immunoglobulins (Ig). Maternal IgG istransported across the placenta before birth and ma-ternal secretory IgA is present in breast milk andcolostrum. These passively acquired antibodies pro- vide protection against pathogens to which themother was immune. However, protection providedby passively transferred antibodies is short-lived.Passively acquired maternal IgG declines during thefirst few months of life, 6and most infants are not breastfed beyond several months of age.7More im - portantly, maternal antibodies offer limited immu- nologic protection when compared with protection afforded by an infant's active immune response.From the *Section of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadel- phia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and Wistar Institute ofAnatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Division of InfectiousDiseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NationalInstitutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; \u00a7National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; /H14067Di- vision of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation, National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,Maryland; \u00b6Section of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital and Re-gional Medical Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Se-attle, Washington; #Department of Pediatrics, University of WashingtonSchool of Medicine, Department of Epidemiology, University of Washing-ton School of Public Health and Community Medicine, and Children'sHospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington; and **Depart- ment of Preventive Medicine, Vanderbilt Medical College, Nashville, Ten-nessee.Received for publication Aug 7, 2001; accepted Oct 4, 2001.Reprint requests to (P.A.O.)

Provided by Amer Acad of Pediatrics on September 30, 2009 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Active Immunity Neonates are capable of generating both humoral and cellular immune responses to pathogens at the time of birth.8,9Active immunity in the newborn includes the full range of B-cell responses includingthe production of IgM, IgG, and secretory and mo-nomeric IgA, as well as the development of (Th) and cytotoxic T-cell that participate in cell-me-diated immune responses and Th2-type cells that areprimarily involved in promoting B-cell responses. 8,9 The development of active humoral and cellular immune responses in the newborn is necessary tomeet the tremendous number of environmental chal-lenges encountered from the moment of birth. Whenchildren are born, they emerge from the relatively sterile environment of the uterus into a world teem-ing with bacteria and other microorganisms. Begin-ning with the birth process, the newborn is exposedto microbes from the mother 's cervix and birth canal, then the surrounding environment. Within a matterof hours, the gastrointestinal tract of the newborn,initially relatively free of microbes, is heavily colo-nized with bacteria. 10The most common of these colonizing bacteria include facultative anaerobic bac- teria, such as Escherichia and such as Bacteroides and Clos- tridium .10Specific secretory IgA responses directed against these potentially harmful bacteria are pro-duced by the neonate 's intestinal lymphocytes within the first week of life. 11 Functional Differences Between Infant and Adult Immune Responses Although infants can generate all functional T-cells (ie, Th1, Th2, and cytotoxic T-cells),8,9infant B-cell responses are deficient when compared with older children and adults. Infants respond well to antigens(such as proteins) that require T-cell help for devel-opment. However, until about 2 years of age, the B-cell response to T-cell-independent antigens (suchas polysaccharides) is considerably less than thatfound in adults. 12For this reason, infants are uniquely susceptible to bacteria that are coated with polysaccharides (such as Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib] and Streptococcus pneumoniae ).IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINES BY NEONATES The neonate is capable of mounting a protective immune response to vaccines within hours of birth.9 For example, neonates born to mothers with hepatitisB virus infection mount an excellent protective im-mune response to hepatitis B vaccine given at birth,even without additional use of hepatitis B virus-specific immunoglobulin. 13-15In addition, BCG vac- thatprotect subsequent develop-ment of miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous men-ingitis. 16-18 IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINES BY INFANTS The young infant is fully capable of generating protective humoral and cellular immune responsesto multiple vaccines simultaneously. Approximately90% of infants develop active protective immuneresponses to the primary series of diphtheria-teta- nus-acellular-pertussis, hepatitis B, pneumococcus,Hib, and inactivated polio vaccines given between 2months and 6 months of age. 19 To circumvent the infant 's inability to mount T- cell-independent B-cell responses, polysaccharide vaccines (Hib and S pneumoniae ) are linked to pro- teins (ie, diphtheria toxoid, diphtheria toxin mutantprotein, tetanus toxoid, or meningococcal group B outer-membrane protein) that engage the infant 's Th-cells. By converting a T-cell-independent immuneresponse to a T-cell-dependent response, conjugatevaccines can be recognized by the infant 's B-cells. Conjugate vaccines, therefore, induce protective im-mune responses in infants that are often greater thanthose found after natural infection. 20 IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINES BY CHILDREN WITH IMMUNODEFICIENCIES Severely immunocompromised children (specifi- cally, those with T-cell defects) receive live viral vaccines (eg, measles or varicella vaccines)21,22or live bacterial vaccines develop disseminated infections with these attenuated patho-gens. However, the only live vaccine that was rou-tinely given in the United States in the first year oflife, the oral polio vaccine (OPV), has now been replaced with inactivated polio vaccine. Therefore,children do not receive their first live viral vaccinesTABLE 1.

The diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis vaccines were given in combination (DTP), and thepolio vaccine (inactivated) was given as a series of 3 injections.In 1980, children received the DTP, polio, and MMR vaccines. The DTP and MMR vaccines were given in combination and the polio vaccine (live, attenuated) was given by mouth.\u00a7In 2000 children received the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis, MMR, inactivated polio, Hib, varicella, conjugate pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. SPECIAL ARTICLE 125. Provided by Amer Acad of Pediatrics on September 30, 2009 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from until about 12 to 15 months of age. Most children with severe T-cell deficiencies (eg, severe combinedimmunodeficiency syndrome) will have been identi-fied by 6 to 8 months of age. 24,25 However, many children with immunodeficien- cies respond well to live viral vaccines. Because therisk of severe infection is greater after natural infec-tion with wild-type viruses than immunization withhighly attenuated viruses, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and American Academyof Pediatrics recommend that certain immunocom-promised children should receive live viral vaccines.For example, children with human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) infection without severe T-celldeficiencies (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion class N1 or A1 and age-specific percentage ofCD4 /H11001lymphocytes vaccines.26-28Immunizations are by HIV-infected children and confer pro-tective immunity. 29,30Immunization with live viral vaccines has also been demonstrated to be safe andeffective in certain children with malignancies and inchildren following bone marrow transplantation. 31,32 IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINES BY CHILDREN WITH MILD, MODERATE, OR SEVERE ILLNESSES Some parents may be concerned that children with acute illnesses are, in a sense, immunocompromised,and that they are less likely to respond to vaccines ormore likely to develop adverse reactions to vaccinesthan healthy children. Alternatively, parents may believe that children who are ill should not furtherburden an immune system already committed tofighting an infection. However, vaccine-specific an-tibody responses and rates of vaccine-associated ad-verse reactions of children with mild or moderateillnesses are comparable to those of healthy children.For example, the presence of upper respiratory tractinfections, otitis media, fever, skin infections, or di-arrhea do not affect the level of protective antibodiesinduced by immunization. 33-37 Data on the capacity of vaccines to induce protec- tive immune responses in children with severe infec- tions (such as those with bacterial pneumonia ormeningitis) are lacking. Although a delay in vaccinesis recommended for children with severe illnesses until the symptoms of illness resolve, 26this recom - mendation is not based on the likelihood that the child will have an inadequate immune response to the vaccine. Rather, the reason for deferring immu-nization is to avoid superimposing a reaction to the vaccine on the underlying illness or to mistakenly attribute a manifestation of the underlying illness tothe vaccine. 26 DO VACCINES \"OVERWHELM \"THE IMMUNE SYSTEM? Infants Have the Capacity to Respond to an Enormous Number of Antigens Studies on the diversity of antigen receptors indi- cate that the immune system has the capacity to respond to extremely large numbers of antigens.Current data suggest that the theoretical capacity determined by diversity of antibody variable generegions would allow for as many as 10 9to 1011dif- ferent antibody specificities.38But this prediction is limited by the number of circulating B cells and the likely redundancy of antibodies generated by an in-dividual. A more practical way to determine the diversity of the immune response would be to estimate the num- ber of vaccines to which a child could respond at onetime. If we assume that 1) approximately 10 ng/mLof antibody is likely to be an effective concentrationof antibody per epitope (an immunologically distinctregion of a protein or polysaccharide), 392) genera - tion of 10 ng/mL requires approximately 103B-cells per mL,393) a single B-cell clone takes about 1 week to reach the 103progeny B-cells required to secrete 10 ng/mL of antibody39(therefore, vaccine-epitope- specific immune responses found about 1 week after immunization can be generated initially from a sin-gle B-cell clone per mL), 4) each vaccine containsapproximately 100 antigens and 10 epitopes per an- tigen (ie, 10 3epitopes), and 5) approximately 107B cells are present per mL of circulating blood,39then each infant would have the theoretical capacity to respond to about 10 000 vaccines at any one time(obtained by dividing 10 7B cells per mL by 103 epitopes per vaccine). Of course, most vaccines contain far fewer than 100 antigens (for example, the hepatitis B, diphtheria,and tetanus vaccines each contain 1 antigen), so theestimated number of vaccines to which a child could respond is conservative. But using this estimate, wewould predict that if 11 vaccines were given to in-fants at one time, then about 0.1% of the immunesystem would be \"used up. \" However, because naive B- and T-cells are con- stantly replenished, a vaccine never really \"uses up \" a fraction of the immune system. For example, stud-ies of T-cell population dynamics in HIV-infectedpatients indicate that the human T-cell compartmentis highly productive. 40Specifically, the immune sys - tem has the ability to replenish about 2 billion CD4/H11001 T lymphocytes each day. Although this replacement activity is most likely much higher than needed forthe normal (and as yet unknown) CD4 /H11001T-cell turn - over rate, it illustrates the enormous capacity of the immune system to generate lymphocytes as needed. Children are Exposed to Fewer Antigens in Vaccines Today Than in the Past Parents who are worried about the increasing number of recommended vaccines may take comfort in knowing that children are exposed to fewer anti-gens (proteins and polysaccharides) in vaccines to-day than in the past. Table 2 summarizes the number of proteins and polysaccharides contained in routinely recom- mended vaccines administered over the past 100years. Although we now give children more vac-cines, the actual number of antigens they receive hasdeclined. Whereas previously 1 vaccine, smallpox,contained about 200 proteins, now the 11 routinelyrecommended vaccines contain fewer than 130 pro- 126 INFANT 'S IMMUNE RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE VACCINES. Provided by Amer Acad of Pediatrics on September 30, 2009 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from teins in total. Two factors account for this decline: first, the worldwide eradication of smallpox obviatedthe need for that vaccine, and second, advances inprotein chemistry have resulted in vaccines contain-ing fewer antigens (eg, replacement of whole-cell with acellular pertussis vaccine). Children Respond to Multiple Vaccines Given at the Same Time in a Manner Similar to Individual Vaccines If vaccines overwhelmed or weakened the im- mune system, then one would expect lesser immune responses when vaccines are given at the same timeas compared with when they are given at differenttimes. 41,42However, the following vaccines induce similar humoral immune responses when given atthe same or 7) DTP and Hib.49 Achieving similar immune responses by giving vaccines at the same time at different sites may bemore easily accomplished than by combining vac-cines in the same syringe. Challenges to giving manyvaccines in a single injection are based partly on incompatibilities of agents used to buffer or stabilizeindividual vaccines. 50 DO VACCINES \"WEAKEN \"THE IMMUNE SYSTEM? Do Vaccines Increase the Risk of Other Infections? Vaccines may cause temporary suppression of de- layed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions or alter certain lymphocyte function tests in vitro.51-57How -ever, the short-lived immunosuppression caused by certain vaccines does not result in an increased riskof infections with other pathogens soon after vacci-nation. Vaccinated children are not at greater risk ofsubsequent infections with other pathogens than un- vaccinated children. 58-60On the contrary, in Ger - many, a study of 496 vaccinated and unvaccinated children found that children who received immuni-zations against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib, and polio within the first 3 months of life had fewer infections with vaccine-related and -unrelated patho-gens than the nonvaccinated group. 61 Bacterial and viral infections, on the other hand, often predispose children and adults to severe, inva-sive infections with other pathogens. For example,patients with pneumococcal pneumonia are morelikely to have had a recent influenza infection thanmatched controls. 62Similarly, varicella infection in - creases susceptibility to strep- tococcal infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, toxicshock syndrome, and bacteremia. 63 SUMMARY Current studies do not support the hypothesis that multiple vaccines overwhelm, weaken, or \"use up \" the immune system. On the contrary, young infantshave an enormous capacity to respond to multiplevaccines, as well as to the many other challengespresent in the environment. By providing protectionagainst a number of bacterial and viral pathogens,vaccines prevent the \"weakening \"of the immune system and consequent secondary bacterial infec-tions occasionally caused by natural infection.TABLE 2.
