About 100 faculty and staff observed the protocol to help usher in the fall 2022 semester and celebrate the naming of the Great Lawn, Makahiapo, which means first-born child. The sprawling lawn is at the center of the campus and is the backdrop for a wide array of events held at the college. Nwaa Napoleon, dean of arts and sciences at Kapiolani CC organized the special ceremony alongside members of the college's Native Hawaiian council, [Aha Kalualani](https://ohana.kapiolani.hawaii.edu/authorized-governance-organizations/kalaualani/). \"The Great Lawn has been named the most cherished place on campus when we did a long range development plan in 2010. We felt it was the time to honor it, give it a name and use the occasion to bring the faculty and staff back together again,\" Kapiolani CC Chancellor Louise Pagotto said. \"What we want is to also integrate Hawaiian values into our daily operations on the campus, and this occasion marked how that can be done.\" To help convey a deeper symbolism to the meaning behind the lawn's new name, organizers identified 15 faculty and staff members who are makahiapo or first-borns in their ohana to take part in a special portion of the ceremony. Each person selected represented one of the 15 kananiau (traditional name for ahupuaa or land division on Oahu) within the moku (district) of Kona where Kapiolani CC sits. A majority of the participants also reside in the kananiau they represented. - Maunalua\u2014Maria Bautista - Moanalua\u2014Austin Bedecked in blue khei, faculty and staff poured fresh water brought from their kananiau onto an ahu (altar) sitting in the center of the lawn. The water, collected from ua (rain) or pnwai (water spring) of each kananiau, was carried in ohe (bamboo) which embodies the Hawaiian god Kne. \"The fact that I was still part of today and I am here and my colleagues are so uplifting and it just makes me want to start the semester,\" said Burke, a hospitality and tourism professor. \"I just can't wait for the students to come back and share the positive energy that has begun today.\" Part of the ceremony also paid homage to Pagotto who will retire this December after a 33-year-long career at Kapiolani CC. Faculty and staff chanted to the respected scholar while they adorned her with lei. In 2015, Pagotto advocated to have a handbook created to help Kapiolani CC students, faculty and staff connect with the campus' cultural roots and history. The idea for the handbook came after she read a similar book while visiting Waiariki Institute of Technology in Rotorua, Aotearoa. Aha Kalualani published the 88-page bilingual handbook, Ka Wehena Kaiao (Breaking of Dawn), in 2021 which covers the ina (land) the campus sprawls across, lawena waiwai (values), mele (songs) compositions and historical footprints. - Related UH News story: [Cultural guide to "}
