Constituency RepresentativesHans Baer, PhD Patch Adams, MD Board of Directors 2 The NCNM Connection www.ncnm.edu 3Dear Colleagues: There's no doubt about it. This has been a watershed year\u2014for the U .S., for education\u2014and certainly for NCNM. The economic realities impacting each one of us are unfolding every day, often in alarming ways. Happily, our new U .S. president has been working quickly in his first 100 days, reengineering an economy which will better serve the people, offering a clear vision of hope in a land known for its optimism and energy. His inspiring example is to take decisive action building a more powerful future. Along with the rest of the higher education community, NCNM has had to make prudent belt-tightening adjustments to avoid deferring shortfalls into next year and beyond. Such budgetary diligence makes it possible for us to move ahead with our plans for the NCNM expansion onto the site of our new teaching clinic. Even in tough times, we at NCNM have a lot to be hopeful about. Much has occurred in just a few months. While we mourned the passing of Dr. Frank Spaulding, an NCNM founding father, our faculty and alumni are touching lives and expanding minds far, far beyond the halls of our school. The torch of the profession once held high by Dr. Spaulding and others has been taken up by passionate, visionary leaders who continue to carry forward their love for the natural healing arts. W e celebrated that love at this year's Sweetheart Medicine Ball, which raised thousands of dollars for our new clinic through ticket sales and silent auction items (including $400 for a painting by multi-talented Dr. Marcus Miller). The Ball also gave us an opportunity to commemorate the remarkable 100th anniversary of the oldest naturopathic association in the U .S., the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Promising signs of growth were apparent everywhere in the past few months. Our Board is expanding its outreach with the development of NCNM's first Board of Regents. And, despite the tight economy, our Advancement department is steadily attracting major new donors who are helping us grow. NCNM's new Continuing Education program is gaining popularity. The Helfgott Research Institute continues to blaze new trails and receive accolades. There is much to be proud of and much to look forward to. If this is what we can accomplish in hard times, imagine how bright our future will be as the clouds part and the path clears! As always, I look forward to sharing that path toward our growing success with each of you. All the very best to you and yours, David J. Schleich, PhD President National College of Natural MedicineSigns of a Promising Future A Call for Change \"The future for your alma mater is friendly, indeed. As you read this issue of your NCNM Connection, I think you'll agree. \" Our Mission: To educate and train physicians and practitioners in the art and science of natural medicine. \"History teaches everything, including the future. \" -Alphonse de LamartineNCNM was established with little more than a wing and a prayer\u2014short on funding, but abundant in passion and commitment. As naturopathic schools closed one by one, three NCNM founders knew that the profession needed at least one school in order to survive. Their efforts and the tenaciousness of a network of naturopathic physicians held the ground until the resurgence of natural medicine gathered momentum and began to inch forward in the early 1970s. Long before there were superhighways or Starbucks, Drs. Frank Spaulding, Martin Bleything and Charles Stone rallied their colleagues to start a college. Dr. Ken Petersen took a year away from his practice to drive cross-country to raise money for the new school. These naturopathic pioneers are now revered as true visionaries, midwives to a growing movement of health-consciousness seeded by their imaginations, their work and their belief. T wo years ago, Dr. Spaulding reveled in what had taken place at the little school he once helped open on Hawthorne Street. Invited back to NCNM to receive an honorary degree, he looked around at all the caps and gowns filling the room. Shaking his head, he exclaimed, \"I've never seen so many naturopathic doctors in one room before!\" Dr. Spaulding, NCNM's first board chair, died Jan. 8 at the age of 86. His immense contribution to natural medicine was largely unrecognized. At his funeral service in Fairbanks, Alaska, Susan Hunter , vice president of Advancement, gave Dr. Spaulding's eulogy on behalf of NCNM. She learned with surprise that the many mourners had no idea that Dr. Spaulding had founded a medical college. Or that this particular medical college has contributed to the revival of the medicine he practiced all his life. Another early supporter of the school, Dr. Robert Fleming, whose association began as a longtime faculty member and member of the Board of T rustees, also served as NCNM president. On Dr. Fleming's recent 90th birthday, NCNM's president, Dr. David J. Schleich, paid tribute to Dr. Fleming and all the great leaders who paved the road for our graduates when he said, \"NCNM's past is filled with dedicated men and women who helped create a medical college that has endured. Their example especially inspires us today, in a time of economic uncertainty. As William Butler Y eats once said, 'Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.' Our leaders past and present commit their lives to lighting the fire of theoretical and clinical knowledge.\" At this pivotal time in NCNM's history, the torch is passing from NCNM's pioneers to others whose dedication and commitment to the profession have been tested and proven: Leaders like Heiner Fruehauf, PhD, and Rita Bettenburg, ND, personify a high level of achievement, the professional bedrock upon which our college is built. They've both run with the NCNM torch for many years as past and present heads of their prospective Schools of Medicine. Their leadership is honored this year. Dr. Fruehauf, founding professor of the School of Classical Chinese Medicine, is widely recognized as one of classical Chinese medicine's most distinguished proponents. He most recently made history when he became the first non-Chinese person to be awarded a professorship at Guangxi College of T raditional Chinese Medicine in mainland China. In December 2008, Dr. Fruehauf delivered a series of lectures on his cutting-edge research. His lectures are being transcribed for publication in China. Dr. Fruehauf also received the illustrious \"Building Bridges of Integration\" award for his pioneering work from the T raditional Chinese Medicine W orld Foundation last year. Dr. Fruehauf 's work continues to gain widespread admiration. He recently became the recipient of two $10,000 donations for scholarship in classical Chinese medicine from the Rick and Ellie Meyers Family Foundation and the V ollum Foundation. (See p. 9 for information about Dr. Fruehauf 's lecture May 9.) Dr. Rita Bettenburg, dean of NCNM's School of Naturopathic Medicine, is a widely recognized flag-bearer for the college and for naturopathic medicine. She's worn a lot of hats to advance the medicine, including former president of the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Medicine and board director of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Dr. Bettenburg has also been instrumental in the development of NCNM's community clinics for more than a decade. Heiner Fruehauf, PhD and Rita Bettenburg, ND Drs. Frank Spaulding (l) and Robert Fleming 4 The NCNM Connection www.ncnm.edu 5Passing the Torch TORCH continued on page 13New Lab Dedicated to Energy Medicine In a bright red room in the northwest corner of the Helfgott Research Institute, researchers, NCNM students and other collaborators are busy untangling the mysteries of energy medicine in Helfgott's new psychophysiology lab. After obtaining a generous donation in 2007, Senior Investigator Agatha Colbert, MD, established the lab in order to study subtle physiologic changes that occur in response to a variety of natural medicine treatments. Helfgott researchers are now able to measure heart rate variability, respiration rate, skin temperature, blood pressure, brain waves and other vital functions. Dr. Colbert and her team want to see if these objective outcome measures correlate with people's subjective reports of improvement as indicators of response to meditation, neurofeedback, acupuncture, homeopathy, manipulation, massage and other therapies. There are a number of exciting projects in the works. Dr. Colbert, assisted by a group of engineers, physicists and students, is currently measuring skin impedance at acupuncture points using a recently developed 8-channel measurement instrument. They will also study other autonomic nervous system (ANS) parameters in relation to acupuncture points and non-acupuncture points. Another project under way is the study of potential benefits of neurofeedback as a treatment for insomnia. Students are taking an active role in the studies, including student Drew Litchy, ND2, who is investigating the effects of meditation training on heart rate variability. All of these projects are bringing Helfgott a few steps closer to being able to use physiological measurements to quantify exactly how natural medicine treatments affect the body.SPARC Symposium in April The 2009 Symposium for Portland Area Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (SPARC) is coming up soon\u2014Sat., April 18 at Oregon Health & Science University. SPARC highlights current CAM research from local investigators and promotes scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing. The fourth-annual symposium will focus on emerging directions in CAM research. Keynote speaker, Dr. Josephine Briggs, of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, will discuss \"The Promise in Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\" Y ou can register online at www.occim.org or by calling 503.552.1743. A Tanzanian Adventure For Heather Zwickey, PhD, the fall quarter at NCNM usually brings a whirlwind of classes, meetings, lab work and new faces. This year was equally busy, except that Dr. Zwickey was halfway around the world in T anzania. Dr. Zwickey spent time with a traditional healer in T anga and learned how he treats patients with HIV. The healer works in tandem with doctors at the local hospital, and this combination of medical approaches has helped to extend the life expectancy for HIV patients from two years to 15 years. Only six percent of patients can obtain HIV drugs in this part of T anzania. Ashwagandha Research Honored Again A group of third-year NCNM students captured a first-place research prize in January at the 6th Annual Natural Supplements: An Evidence-Based Update, a conference sponsored by the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in San Diego. This is the second award the third-year naturopathic medical students have received for their clinical study of Ashwagandha, also known as Indian Ginseng. This original research study was led by NCNM's dean of research, Dr. Heather Zwickey. Naturopathic medical students Andrew Erlandson, Jeremy Mikolai and Andrew Murison found that drinking whole cows' milk with Ashwagandha, an herb used for more than 5,000 years in the practice of Ayurvedic medicine, can increase the body's white blood cells which help boost immunity. Erlandson and Murison presented a poster on this research at the Scripps conference and were awarded a $1,000 prize. Their research will also be showcased in the March 2009 issue of \"Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.\"Flu Study This proposal is a clinical study of homeopathic treatment of influenza. Flu cases usually increase during the winter. These yearly epidemics are caused by different influenza viruses and are affected by many factors. Each year, the severity and case symptoms of the flu are unpredictable. Present treatment for the flu is only partially effective and new treatments are needed. Homeopathy is a widely used medical system whose supporters claim good success in treating flu.

ML: Y ou call your CE class \"Functional Gastroenterology. \" What does it entail?SSL: There are many patients whose digestive problems are a result of altered function rather than pathology; functional problems such as altered motility; enzyme, acid or bicarb levels. Increased inflammation and sensitivity to pain are not really treatable with drugs or surgery because there is not really a problem to shut off or remove. The problem is a failure of the system to work in a coordinated way. Our course objective is to teach how to restore proper function to the GI system. ML: How common are functional gastroenterology problems in the average gastroenterologist's practice? SSL: Functional diagnoses account for about 40 percent of the average gastroenterologist's patient load. Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common of these. ML: What skills do attendees learn in your class? Can they be implemented the next day in the clinic? SSL: First, it is important to understand exactly what is causing the functional problems by reviewing the psychophysiology of digestion. Then we focus on interpretation of GI lab results and do the diagnostic tests needed to determine stomach pH. Finally, we teach many practical modalities, such as Chapman's and Riddler's reflex points, regional focus structural integration, basic visceral manipulation and emotional clearing techniques. ML: Can this information help expand a practice? SSL: The gastroenterologists I work with are relieved to have a referral option for patients with functional diagnoses. These specialists are more focused on doing endoscopic evaluation of pathology, visualizing disease and treating it with surgery and/or drugs. I can see this being a very good opportunity for new NDs to get their practices up and running. Hooking up with a GI office could be a source of many referrals on a regular basis. Over time, the gastroenterologist may ask for help with patients who have pathologic conditions as well.\"Having naturopathic doctors and chiropractors work with functional problems while MDs work with structural problems that require more invasive procedures is a win-win situation. \" -Steven Sandberg-Lewis, NDUpcoming Events Abdominal Acupuncture Saturday & Sunday, April 11-12 from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Presented by Dr. Roger Batchelor, DAOM, LAc Based on ancient teachings, this system of acupuncture is still new, very gentle and accessible.

On Dec. 20, Vicki Lippman, Charlene Sherwood and Jay Zidell had a special birthday present for their mother, Min Zidell. In celebration of her 85th birthday, Min was surprised with a unique gift: Her children are sponsoring a new herb garden at NCNM, the Min Zidell Garden. The generous Zidell family donation will allow NCNM to create a large community herb garden on the new Corbett Street property. The garden will take shape in a courtyard behind the new clinic on a 100 by 50 square feet patch of land. Susan Hunter, vice president of Advancement said, \"The Min Zidell Garden will inspire our spirits and passions, and show our students, patients and the community what the 'original' medicines look like fresh from the garden.\" Hunter believes the garden will be a focal point for the larger community. She said, \"The Min Zidell Garden is intended to nurture the NCNM community and our patients, but also our neighbors in the South W aterfront-Lair Hill community. W e hope it will engender our joi de vivre, love of life.\" Hunter adds that it will be a garden for all seasons. She said, \"Gardens are like our mothers\u2014they're beautiful no matter the time or season, and they comfort us and bring us joy throughout our lives. W ell-tended gardens are an unending source of growth, abundance, renewal and gathering for our community. W e are so much less without them.\" The gift of a garden at NCNM was especially touching for Min Zidell. It turns out that, as a girl, she attended the Josiah Failing Elementary School\u2014more commonly known as the NCNM academic building! The synchronicities continue: NCNM bought the new property from Debbie and Andy Davis, who know the Zidells. Their mom and Min were best friends when they went to school together at Josiah Failing School!A Beautiful Clinic, Courtesy of Miller Paint Paul Sawyer, Miller Paint Company's director of Marketing, announced in November that the Portland-based company will donate all paint for both the inside and outside of NCNM's new teaching clinic\u2014an estimated 1,500 gallons. Miller Paint's generosity is legion in Portland. Last year, Dove Lewis Emergency Animal Hospital was the beneficiary of Miller Paint's community-minded spirit. This year NCNM will receive Miller Paint's finest brands: Paints that are green-seal certified, low volatile organic compounds, and mold and mildew resistant, with an exceptional color palette to select from. NCNM's new clinic will be a showcase for a beautiful array of environmentally healthy color, thanks to Miller Paint. Thorne Research Supports Community Clinics Al Czap, president of Thorne Research, announced the company's support of a new residency program at the clinic of Dr. James Sensenig. The program, coordinated by NCNM's Partners Program, will also provide much needed medicines for NCNM's many low-cost community clinics. Thorne Research, a leader in the manufacture of nutritional supplements and the publisher of \" Alternative Medical Review, A Journal of Clinical Therapeutics\" , is well-known to the naturopathic profession for its exceptional formulations and high quality products. Biotics Sponsors Foundation Textbook Biotics Research Corporation has been a leading manufacturer of specially designed nutritional products for more than 30 years. Biotics recently joined NCNM Partners Program to support the Foundations of Naturopathic Medicine project - an international textbook codifying the knowledge of naturopathic theory, diagnoses and treatments. The Biotics mission has been a staple within the naturopathic community through its longtime commitment to high quality, innovative products. Both NCNM and the wider naturopathic community are grateful for Biotics' assistance to this valuable cause. 10 The NCNM Connection www.ncnm.edu 11Happenings Around Campus Davis, Sussanna Czeranko, and Susan Hunter.And that's not all. She has long led the effort for educational standards within accredited colleges of naturopathic medicine through her work for the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), the international accrediting agency that sets the standards of education for naturopathic programs. Dr. Bettenburg's work with the CNME was recently recognized when she was named president-elect of the agency. Her term begins in August. The appointment is a distinction that honors Dr. Bettenburg's work on behalf of the profession, while also recognizing her longstanding leadership at NCNM. NCNM Connections salutes our leaders, past and present. Their efforts to blaze a path for natural medicine physicians and practitioners are touching countless lives today and into the future. Dr. Zwickey also volunteered at a clinic in the Masoko ward, where she helped to weigh and measure children less than five years of age and conducted focus groups with local mothers. She visited micro-loan sites where funds generated from these loans help to support families and children living with HIV. Dr. Zwickey is committed to keeping in touch with the people she visited. She plans to return with a study group soon.usual homeopathic practice, one of many homeopathic remedies is picked after a careful interview to match individual characteristics of the patient's case. Each year a different homeopathic remedy is most common. In this study, Helfgott is evaluating and treating a small group of flu patients with a remedy picked from cases early in the flu season. Doctors will also compare the effect of the remedy or a placebo to the usual course of the flu. Symptoms will be evaluated over two weeks (or until the symptoms clear).
