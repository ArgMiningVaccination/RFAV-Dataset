Overview Simvastatin is a HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor that is FDA approved for the {{{indicationType}}} of reductions in risk of [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality and [cardiovascular](/index.php/Cardiovascular) events, [hyperlipidemia](/index.php/Hyperlipidemia), adolescent patients with respiratory infection](/index.php/Upper_respiratory_infection). and Dosage (Adult) Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and IIb) Recommended Dosing The usual dosage range is 5 to 40 mg/day. In patients with CHD or at high risk of CHD, simvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet. The recommended usual starting dose is 10 or 20 mg once a day in the evening. For patients at high risk for a CHD event due to existing CHD, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, the recommended starting dose is 40 mg/day. Lipid determinations should be performed after 4 weeks of therapy and periodically thereafter. Restricted Dosing for 80 mg Due to the increased risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), particularly during the first year of treatment, use of the 80-mg dose of simvastatin should be restricted to patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. Patients who are currently tolerating the 80-mg dose of simvastatin who need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin should be switched to an alternative [statin](/index.php/Statin) with less potential for the drug-drug interaction. Due to the increased risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), associated with the 80-mg dose of simvastatin, patients unable to achieve their LDL-C goal utilizing the 40-mg dose of simvastatin should not be titrated to the 80-mg dose, but should be placed on alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment(s) that provides greater LDL-C lowering. Coadministration with Other Drugs Patients taking [Verapamil](/index.php/Verapamil), [Diltiazem](/index.php/Diltiazem), or [Dronedarone](/index.php/Dronedarone) The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 10 mg/day. Patients taking [Amiodarone](/index.php/Amiodarone), [Amlodipine](/index.php/Amlodipine) or [Ranolazine](/index.php/Ranolazine) The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg/day. Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended dosage is 40 mg/day in the evening. simvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Simvastatin exposure is approximately doubled with concomitant use of [lomitapide](/index.php/Lomitapide); therefore, the dose of simvastatin should be reduced by 50% if initiating [lomitapide](/index.php/Lomitapide). simvastatin dosage should not exceed 20 mg/day (or 40 mg/day for patients who have previously taken simvastatin 80 mg/day chronically, e.g., for 12 months or more, without evidence of muscle toxicity) while taking [lomitapide](/index.php/Lomitapide). Patients with Renal Impairment Because simvastatin does not undergo significant renal excretion, modification of dosage should not be necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised when simvastatin is administered to patients with severe renal impairment; such patients should be started at 5 mg/day and be closely monitored. Chinese Patients Taking Lipid-Modifying Doses (1 g/day Niacin) of Niacin-Containing Products Because of an increased risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day niacin) of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. Because the risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. The cause of the increased risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is not known. It is also unknown if the risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) with coadministration of simvastatin with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products observed in Chinese patients applies to other Asian patients.

Contraindications - Concomitant administration of strong [CYP3A4](/index.php/CYP3A4)inhibitors [gemfibrozil](/index.php/Gemfibrozil), [cyclosporine](/index.php/Cyclosporine), or [danazol](/index.php/Danazol). [Hypersensitivity](/index.php/Hypersensitivity)to any component of this medication. - Active [liver](/index.php/Liver)disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic [transaminase](/index.php/Transaminase)levels. - Women who are [pregnant](/index.php/Pregnant)or may become [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol)and [triglycerides](/index.php/Triglycerides)increase inhibitors ( [statins](/index.php/Statins)) decrease [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol)synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol), simvastatin may cause [fetal](/index.php/Fetal)harm when administered to a [pregnant](/index.php/Pregnant)woman. [Atherosclerosis](/index.php/Atherosclerosis)is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during [pregnancy](/index.php/Pregnancy)should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary [hypercholesterolemia](/index.php/Hypercholesterolemia). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of use with simvastatin during pregnancy; however, in rare reports congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, simvastatin revealed no evidence of [teratogenicity](/index.php/Teratogenicity). Simvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive. If the patient becomes [pregnant](/index.php/Pregnant)while taking this drug, simvastatin should be discontinued immediately and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the [fetus](/index.php/Fetus). - Serum - Nursing mothers - It is not known whether simvastatin is excreted into human milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because [statins](/index.php/Statins)have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require treatment with simvastatin should not [breastfeed](/index.php?title=Breastfeed&action=edit&redlink=1)their infants. - It is not known whether simvastatin is excreted into human milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because Warnings Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis Simvastatin occasionally causes [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) sometimes takes the form of [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) with or without acute renal failure secondary to [myoglobinuria](/index.php/Myoglobinuria), and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. Predisposing factors for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) include advanced age (65 years), female gender, uncontrolled [hypothyroidism](/index.php/Hypothyroidism), and renal impairment. The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), is dose related. In a clinical trial database in which 41,413 patients were treated with simvastatin, 24,747 (approximately 60%) of whom were enrolled in studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, the incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively. The incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) with 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of [myocardial infarction](/index.php/Myocardial_infarction) were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] >10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) (defined as [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) with a CK >40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), is greater in patients on simvastatin 80 mg compared with other statin therapies with similar or greater [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C)-lowering efficacy and compared with lower doses of simvastatin. Therefore, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. If, however, a patient who is currently tolerating the 80-mg dose of simvastatin needs to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction. Patients should be advised of the increased risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), and to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. If symptoms occur, treatment should be discontinued immediately. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) (IMNM), an autoimmune by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which discontinuation of showing necrotizing [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. All patients starting therapy with simvastatin, or whose dose of simvastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing simvastatin. simvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with simvastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy). Many of the patients who have developed [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) on therapy with simvastatin have had complicated medical histories, including [renal insufficiency](/index.php/Renal_insufficiency) usually as a consequence of long-standing [diabetes mellitus](/index.php/Diabetes_mellitus). Such patients merit closer monitoring. simvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is diagnosed or suspected. simvastatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), e.g., [sepsis](/index.php/Sepsis); Drug Interactions The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) and [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. Simvastatin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4. Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of simvastatin and may increase the risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy). These include ketoconazole, posaconazole, protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, the antidepressant nefazodone, or grapefruit juice. Combination of these drugs with simvastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. The combined use of simvastatin with [gemfibrozil](/index.php/Gemfibrozil), [cyclosporine](/index.php/Cyclosporine), or [danazol](/index.php/Danazol) is contraindicated. Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with simvastatin, as these agents can cause [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) when given alone and the risk is increased when they are co-administered. Cases of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with [colchicine](/index.php/Colchicine), and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with [colchicine](/index.php/Colchicine). The benefits of the combined use of simvastatin with the following drugs should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of combinations: other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates, 1 g/day with coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)) of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. In an ongoing, double-blind, randomized cardiovascular outcomes trial, an independent safety monitoring committee identified that the incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is higher in Chinese compared with non-Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of a [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing product. Caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin in doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. Because the risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. It is unknown if the risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) with coadministration of simvastatin with lipid-modifying doses of [niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products observed in Chinese patients applies to other Asian patients. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in the table below. Liver Dysfunction Persistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum [transaminases](/index.php/Transaminases) have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the [transaminase](/index.php/Transaminase) levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with [jaundice](/index.php/Jaundice) or other clinical signs or symptoms. There was no evidence of [hypersensitivity](/index.php/Hypersensitivity). In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to >3X ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). Elevated transaminases resulted in the discontinuation of 8 patients from therapy in the simvastatin group (n=2,221) and 5 in the placebo group (n=2,223). Of the 1,986 simvastatin treated patients in 4S with normal liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline, 8 (0.4%) developed consecutive LFT elevations to >3X ULN and/or were discontinued due to transaminase elevations during the 5.4 years (median follow-up) of the study. Among these 8 patients, 5 initially developed these abnormalities within the first year. All of the patients in this study received a starting dose of 20 mg of simvastatin; 37% were titrated to 40 mg. In 2 controlled clinical studies in 1,105 patients, the 12-month incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevation without regard to drug relationship was 0.9% and 2.1% at the 40- and 80-mg dose, respectively. No patients developed persistent liver function abnormalities following the initial 6 months of treatment at a given dose. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or [hyperbilirubinemia](/index.php/Hyperbilirubinemia) or [jaundice](/index.php/Jaundice) occurs during treatment with simvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart simvastatin. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy). The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of simvastatin. As with other lipid-lowering agents, moderate (less than 3X ULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with simvastatin. These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with simvastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and did not require interruption of treatment. Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin. [[1]](#cite_note-dailymed.nlm.nih.gov-1) Adverse Reactions Clinical Trials Experience Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the pre-marketing controlled clinical studies and their open extensions (2,423 patients with median duration of follow-up of approximately 18 months), 1.4% of patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%), [myalgia ](/index.php/Myalgia)(0.1%), and [arthralgia](/index.php/Arthralgia)(0.1%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence 5%) in simvastatin controlled clinical trials 4,444 (age range 35-71 years, 19% 20-40 mg/day of simvastatin (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) over a median of 5.4 years, adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. Heart Protection Study In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), involving 20,536 patients (age range 40-80 years, 25% women, 97% Caucasians, 3% other races) treated with simvastatin 40 mg/day (n=10,269) or placebo (n=10,267) over a mean of 5 years, only serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to any adverse reactions were recorded. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 4.8% in patients treated with simvastatin compared with 5.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy)/ [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) was <0.1% in patients treated with simvastatin. Other Clinical Studies In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of [myocardial infarction](/index.php/Myocardial_infarction) were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] >10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) (defined as myopathy with a CK >40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were: [diarrhea](/index.php/Diarrhea), [rash](/index.php/Rash), [dyspepsia](/index.php/Dyspepsia), [flatulence](/index.php/Flatulence), and [asthenia](/index.php/Asthenia). Laboratory Tests Marked of hepatic transaminases have been noted. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and -glutamyl transpeptidase have also been reported. About 5% of patients had elevations of CK levels of 3 or more times the normal value on one or more occasions. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK. Adolescent Patients (ages 10-17 years) In a 48-week, controlled study in adolescent boys and girls who were at least 1 year post-menarche, 10-17 years of age (43.4% treated with placebo or simvastatin(10-40 mg daily), the most common adverse reactions observed in both groups were [upper respiratory infection](/index.php/Upper_respiratory_infection), [headache](/index.php/Headache), abdominal pain, and [nausea](/index.php/Nausea). Postmarketing Experience Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of simvastatin: [pruritus](/index.php/Pruritus), [alopecia](/index.php/Alopecia), a variety of skin changes (e.g., rare immune-mediated necrotizing [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) associated with [statin](/index.php/Statin) use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. An apparent [hypersensitivity](/index.php/Hypersensitivity) syndrome has been reported rarely which has included some of the been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, [amnesia](/index.php/Amnesia), memory impairment, [confusion](/index.php/Confusion)) associated with [statin](/index.php/Statin) use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all [statins](/index.php/Statins). The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon [statin](/index.php/Statin) discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). [[1]](#cite_note-dailymed.nlm.nih.gov-1) Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors, cyclosporine, or danazol Strong [CYP3A4](/index.php/CYP3A4) inhibitors: Simvastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of CYP3A4. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity increases the risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) and [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), particularly with higher doses of simvastatin. [SeeWarnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] Concomitant use of drugs labeled as having a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is [telithromycin](/index.php/Telithromycin) is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. [Cyclosporine](/index.php/Cyclosporine) or [Danazol](/index.php/Danazol): The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) is increased by concomitant administration of [cyclosporine](/index.php/Cyclosporine) or [danazol](/index.php/Danazol). Therefore, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated. Lipid-Lowering Drugs That Can Cause myopathy When Given Alone [Gemfibrozil](/index.php/Gemfibrozil): Contraindicated with simvastatin. - Other [fibrates](/index.php/Fibrates): Caution when prescribing with simvastatin. Amiodarone, Dronedarone, Ranolazine, or Calcium Channel Blockers The risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), is increased by concomitant administration of [amiodarone](/index.php/Amiodarone), [ranolazine](/index.php/Ranolazine), with lipid-modifying doses (1 g/day [Niacin](/index.php/Niacin)) of [Niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. In particular, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [Niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. Because the risk for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy) is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of [Niacin](/index.php/Niacin)-containing products. Digoxin In one study, concomitant administration of [digoxin](/index.php/Digoxin) with simvastatin resulted in a slight elevation in [digoxin](/index.php/Digoxin) concentrations in plasma. Patients taking [digoxin](/index.php/Digoxin) should be monitored appropriately when simvastatin is initiated. Coumarin Anticoagulants In two clinical studies, one in normal volunteers and the other in hypercholesterolemic patients, simvastatin 20-40 mg/day modestly potentiated the time, reported as [International Normalized Ratio](/index.php/International_Normalized_Ratio) (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 3.4 in the volunteer and patient studies, respectively. With other [statins](/index.php/Statins), clinically evident [bleeding](/index.php/Bleeding) and/or increased [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) time has been reported in a few patients taking [coumarin anticoagulants](/index.php?title=Coumarin_anticoagulants&action=edit&redlink=1) concomitantly. In such patients, [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) time should be determined before starting simvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) time occurs. Once a stable [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) time has been documented, [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on [coumarin anticoagulants](/index.php?title=Coumarin_anticoagulants&action=edit&redlink=1). If the dose of simvastatin is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be repeated. Simvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in [prothrombin](/index.php/Prothrombin) time in patients not taking anticoagulants. Colchicine Cases of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with [colchicine](/index.php/Colchicine), and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with [colchicine](/index.php/Colchicine). [[1]](#cite_note-dailymed.nlm.nih.gov-1) Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy [Pregnancy Category (FDA)](/index.php/Pregnancy_category#United_States): X simvastatin is contraindicated in women who are or may become [pregnant](/index.php/Pregnant). Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during [pregnancy](/index.php/Pregnancy), because [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) and [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. [Atherosclerosis](/index.php/Atherosclerosis) is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary [hypercholesterolemia](/index.php/Hypercholesterolemia) therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of use with simvastatin during pregnancy; however, there are rare reports of congenital anomalies in infants exposed to statins in utero. Animal reproduction studies of simvastatin in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of teratogenicity. Serum [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) or [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) derivatives are essential for fetal development. Because statins decrease [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol), simvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a [pregnant](/index.php/Pregnant) woman. If simvastatin is used during [pregnancy](/index.php/Pregnancy) or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the [fetus](/index.php/Fetus). There are rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to [statins](/index.php/Statins). In a review3 of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or another structurally related [statin](/index.php/Statin), the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and [fetal](/index.php/Fetal) deaths/stillbirths did not exceed those expected in the general population. However, the study was only able to exclude a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over the background rate. In 89% of these cases, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Simvastatin was not [teratogenic](/index.php/Teratogenic) in rats or rabbits at doses (25, 10 mg/kg/day, respectively) that resulted in 3 times the human exposure based on mg/m2 surface area. However, in studies with another structurally-related [statin](/index.php/Statin), skeletal malformations were observed in rats and mice. Women of childbearing potential, who require treatment with simvastatin for a [lipid](/index.php/Lipid) disorder, should be advised to use effective [contraception](/index.php/Contraception). For women trying to conceive, discontinuation of simvastatin should be considered. If [pregnancy](/index.php/Pregnancy) occurs, simvastatin should be immediately discontinued. [Pregnancy Category (AUS)](/index.php/Pregnancy_category#Australia): There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Simvastatin in women who are pregnant. Labor and Delivery There is no FDA guidance on use of Simvastatin during labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether simvastatin is excreted in human milk. Because a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking simvastatin should not nurse their infants. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of simvastatin in patients 10-17 years of age with heterozygous familial [hypercholesterolemia](/index.php/Hypercholesterolemia) have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial in adolescent boys and in girls who were at least 1 year post-menarche. Patients treated with simvastatin had an adverse reaction profile similar to that of patients treated with placebo. Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on simvastatin therapy. Simvastatin has not been studied in patients younger than 10 years of age, nor in pre-menarchal girls. Geriatic Use Of the 2,423 patients who received simvastatin in Phase III clinical studies and the 10,269 patients in the Heart Protection Study who received simvastatin, 363 (15%) and 5,366 (52%), respectively were 65 years old. In HPS, 615 (6%) were 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), simvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. A [pharmacokinetic](/index.php/Pharmacokinetic) study with simvastatin showed the mean plasma level of statin activity to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70-78 years of age compared with patients between 18-30 years of age. In 4S, 1,021 (23%) of 4,444 patients were 65 or older. [Lipid](/index.php/Lipid)-lowering efficacy was at least as great in elderly patients compared with younger patients, and simvastatin significantly reduced total mortality and [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality in elderly patients with a history of [CHD](/index.php/CHD). In HPS, 52% of patients were elderly (4,891 patients 65-69 years and 5,806 patients 70 years or older). he relative risk reductions of [CHD](/index.php/CHD) death, non-fatal [MI](/index.php/MI), [coronary](/index.php/Coronary_revascularization) and non-coronary revascularization procedures, and [stroke](/index.php/Stroke) were similar in older and younger patients. In HPS, among 32,145 patients entering the active run-in period, there were 2 cases of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy)/ [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis); these patients were aged 67 and 73. Of the 7 cases of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy)/ [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis) among 10,269 patients allocated to simvastatin, 4 were aged 65 or more (at baseline), of whom one was over 75. There were no overall differences in safety between older and younger patients in either 4S or HPS. Because advanced age (65 years) is a predisposing factor for [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), simvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a clinical trial of patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg/day, patients 65 years of age had an increased risk of [myopathy](/index.php/Myopathy), including [rhabdomyolysis](/index.php/Rhabdomyolysis), compared to patients <65 years of age. Gender There is no FDA guidance on the use of Simvastatin with respect to specific gender populations. Race There is no FDA guidance on the use of Simvastatin with respect to specific racial populations. Renal Impairment Caution should be exercised when simvastatin is administered to patients with severe renal impairment Hepatic Impairment Simvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels Females of Reproductive Potential and Males There is no FDA guidance on the use of Simvastatin in women of reproductive potentials and males. Immunocompromised Patients There is no FDA guidance one the use of Simvastatin in patients who are immunocompromised. Administration and Monitoring Administration Oral Monitoring There is limited information regarding motoring of Simvastatin in the drug label. IV Compatibility There is limited information regarding the compatibility of Simvastatin and IV administrations. Overdosage Significant lethality was observed in mice after a single oral dose of 9 g/m2. No evidence of lethality was observed in rats or dogs treated with doses of 30 and 100 g/m2, respectively. No specific diagnostic signs were observed in rodents. At these doses the only signs seen in dogs were [emesis](/index.php/Emesis) and mucoid stools. A few cases of overdosage with simvastatinhave been reported; the maximum dose taken was 3.6 g. All patients recovered without sequelae. Supportive measures should be taken in the event of an overdose. The dialyzability of simvastatin and its metabolites in man is not known at present Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active -hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol). In addition, simvastatin reduces [VLDL](/index.php/VLDL) and and increases [HDL-C](/index.php/HDL-C). Structure Simvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent that is derived synthetically from a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus. After oral ingestion, simvastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding -hydroxyacid form. This inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is an early and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Simvastatin is butanoic acid, 2,2-dimethyl-,1,2,3,7,8,8a-hexahydro-3,7-dimethyl-8-[2-(tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-1-naphthalenyl ester, [1S-[1,3,7,8(2S*,4S*),-8a]]. The empirical formula of simvastatin is C25H38O5 and its molecular weight is 418.57. Its structural formula is: Simvastatin is a white to off-white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, and freely soluble in chloroform, methanol and ethanol. Simvastatin talets for oral administration contain either 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg of simvastatin and the following inactive ingredients: ascorbic acid, lactose, magnesium cellulose, starch, talc, and titanium Butylated hydroxyanisole is added as a preservative. Pharmacodynamics Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of [total-C](/index.php/Cholesterol), [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C), as well as decreased levels of [HDL-C](/index.php/HDL-C) are associated with the development of [atherosclerosis](/index.php/Atherosclerosis) and increased cardiovascular risk. Lowering [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) decreases this risk. However, the independent effect of raising [HDL-C](/index.php/HDL-C) or lowering [TG](/index.php/TG) on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Pharmacokinetics Simvastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of is the assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the -hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of simvastatin. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled simvastatin in man, 13% of the dose was excreted in urine and 60% in feces. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (simvastatin plus 14C-metabolites) peaked at 4 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 12 hours postdose. Since simvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, the availability of the drug to the general circulation is low (<5%). Both simvastatin and its -hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (approximately 95%) to human plasma [proteins](/index.php/Proteins). Rat studies indicate that when radiolabeled simvastatin was administered, simvastatin-derived radioactivity crossed the [blood-brain barrier](/index.php/Blood-brain_barrier). The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are the -hydroxyacid of simvastatin and its 6-hydroxy, 6-hydroxymethyl, and 6-exomethylene derivatives. Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within 1.3 to 2.4 hours postdose. While the recommended therapeutic dose range is 5 to 40 mg/day, there was no substantial deviation from linearity of AUC of inhibitors in the general circulation with an increase in dose to as high as 120 mg. Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profile of inhibitors was not affected when simvastatin was administered immediately before an American Heart Association recommended low-fat meal. In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70 and 78 years of age who received simvastatin 40 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18-30 years of age. Clinical study experience in the elderly (n=1522), suggests that there were no overall differences in safety between elderly and younger patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Kinetic studies with another statin, having a similar principal route of elimination, have suggested that for a given dose level higher systemic exposure may be achieved in patients with severe [renal insufficiency](/index.php/Renal_insufficiency) (as measured by [creatinine clearance](/index.php/Creatinine_clearance)). Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of [statins](/index.php/Statins). The increase in AUC for simvastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of [CYP3A](/index.php/CYP3A)4. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, simvastatin at the 80-mg dose had no effect on the metabolism of the [cytochrome P450](/index.php/Cytochrome_P450) isoform is not an inhibitor of [CYP3A](/index.php/CYP3A)4, and, therefore, is not expected to affect the plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by [CYP3A](/index.php/CYP3A)4. Coadministration of simvastatin (40 mg QD for 10 days) resulted in an increase in the maximum mean levels of cardioactive [digoxin](/index.php/Digoxin) (given as a single 0.4 mg dose on day 10) by approximately 0.3 ng/mL. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 72-week carcinogenicity study, mice were administered daily doses of simvastatin of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg body weight, which resulted in mean plasma drug levels approximately 1, 4, and 8 times higher than the mean human plasma drug level, respectively (as total inhibitory activity based on AUC) after an 80-mg oral dose. [Liver carcinomas](/index.php?title=Liver_carcinomas&action=edit&redlink=1) were significantly increased in high-dose females and mid- and high-dose males with a maximum incidence of 90% in males. The incidence of [adenomas](/index.php/Adenomas) of the [liver](/index.php/Liver) was significantly increased in mid- and high-dose females. Drug treatment also significantly increased the incidence of lung adenomas in mid- and high-dose males and females. Adenomas of the Harderian gland (a gland of the eye of rodents) were significantly higher in high-dose mice than in controls. No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed at 25 mg/kg/day. In a separate 92-week carcinogenicity study in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day, no evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed (mean plasma drug levels were 1 times higher than humans given 80 mg simvastatin as measured by AUC). In a two-year study in rats at 25 mg/kg/day, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of [thyroid](/index.php/Thyroid) follicular [adenomas](/index.php/Adenomas) in female rats exposed to approximately 11 times higher levels of simvastatin than in humans given 80 mg simvastatin (as measured by AUC). A second two-year rat carcinogenicity study with doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day produced hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas (in female rats at both doses and in males at 100 mg/kg/day). [Thyroid](/index.php/Thyroid) follicular cell [adenomas](/index.php/Adenomas) were increased in males and females at both doses; [thyroid](/index.php/Thyroid) follicular cell [carcinomas](/index.php/Carcinomas) were increased in females at 100 mg/kg/day. The increased incidence of [thyroid](/index.php/Thyroid) [neoplasms](/index.php/Neoplasms) appears to be consistent with findings from other [statins](/index.php/Statins). These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels (AUC) of approximately 7 and 15 times (males) and 22 and 25 times (females) the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 milligram daily dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with or without rat or mouse [liver](/index.php/Liver) metabolic activation. In addition, no evidence of damage to genetic material was noted in an in vitro alkaline elution assay using rat hepatocytes, a V-79 mammalian cell forward mutation study, an in vitro chromosome aberration study in CHO cells, or an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was decreased fertility in male rats treated with simvastatin for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body weight (4 times the maximum human exposure level, based on AUC, in patients receiving 80 mg/day); however, this effect was not observed during a subsequent fertility study in which simvastatin was administered at this same dose level to male rats for 11 weeks (the entire cycle of spermatogenesis including epididymal maturation). No microscopic changes were observed in the testes of rats from either study. At 180 mg/kg/day, (which produces exposure levels 22 times higher than those in humans taking 80 mg/day based on surface area, mg/m2), seminiferous tubule degeneration (necrosis and loss of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed. In dogs, there was drug-related testicular atrophy, decreased [spermatogenesis](/index.php/Spermatogenesis), spermatocytic degeneration and giant cell formation at 10 mg/kg/day, (approximately 2 times the human exposure, based on AUC, at 80 mg/day). The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology [CNS](/index.php/CNS) Toxicity [Optic nerve](/index.php/Optic_nerve) degeneration was seen in clinically normal dogs treated with simvastatin for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 12 times higher than the mean plasma drug level in humans taking 80 mg/day. A chemically similar drug in this class also produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean plasma drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity). This same drug also produced vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal ganglion cell chromatolysis in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose that resulted in a mean plasma drug level similar to that seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose. [CNS](/index.php/CNS) vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular of perivascular spaces, perivascular [fibrin](/index.php/Fibrin) deposits and [necrosis](/index.php/Necrosis) of small vessels were seen in dogs treated with simvastatin at a dose of 360 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels that were about 14 times higher than the mean plasma drug levels in humans taking 80 mg/day. Similar [CNS](/index.php/CNS) vascular lesions have been observed with several other drugs of this class. There were cataracts in female rats after two years of treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg/day (22 and 25 times the human AUC at 80 mg/day, respectively) and in dogs after three months at 90 mg/kg/day (19 times) and at two years at 50 mg/kg/day (5 times). Clinical Studies Clinical Studies in Adults Reductions in Risk of [CHD](/index.php/CHD) Mortality and Cardiovascular Events In 4S, the effect of therapy with simvastatin on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 patients with [CHD](/index.php/CHD) and baseline study, patients were treated with standard care, including diet, and either simvastatin 20-40 mg/day (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years. Over the course of the study, treatment with simvastatin led to mean reductions in [total-C](/index.php/Cholesterol), [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) and [TG](/index.php/TG) of 25%, 35%, and 10%, a mean increase in [HDL-C](/index.php/HDL-C) of 8%. simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of mortality by 30% (p=0.0003, 182 deaths in the simvastatin group vs 256 deaths in the placebo group). The risk of [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality was significantly reduced by 42% (p=0.00001, 111 vs 189 deaths). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality. simvastatin significantly decreased the risk of having major coronary events ( [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality plus 34% (p<0.00001, 431 vs 622 patients with one or more events). The risk of having a hospital-verified non-fatal [MI](/index.php/MI) was reduced by 37%. simvastatin significantly risk for undergoing myocardial [coronary 37% (p<0.00001, 252 vs 383 patients). simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of fatal plus non-fatal cerebrovascular events (combined [stroke](/index.php/Stroke) and [transient ischemic attacks](/index.php/Transient_ischemic_attacks)) by 28% (p=0.033, 75 vs 102 patients). simvastatin reduced the risk of major coronary events to a similar extent across the range of baseline total and [LDL](/index.php/LDL) [cholesterol](/index.php/Cholesterol) levels. Because there were only 53 female deaths, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in women could not be adequately assessed. However, simvastatin significantly lessened the risk of having major coronary events by 34% (60 vs 91 women with one or more event). The randomization was stratified by [angina](/index.php/Angina) alone (21% of each treatment group) or a previous [MI](/index.php/MI). Because there were only 57 deaths among the patients with [angina](/index.php/Angina) alone at baseline, the effect of simvastatin on mortality in this subgroup could not be adequately assessed. However, trends in reduced coronary mortality, major coronary events and [revascularization](/index.php/Revascularization) procedures were consistent between this group and the total study cohort. Additionally, simvastatin resulted in similar decreases in relative risk for total mortality, [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality, and major coronary events in elderly patients (65 years), compared with younger patients. The Heart Protection Study (HPS) was a large, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with a mean duration of 5 years conducted in 20,536 patients (10,269 on simvastatin 40 mg and 10,267 on placebo). Patients were allocated to treatment using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of 10 important baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients had a mean age of 64 years (range 40-80 years), were 97% caucasian and were at high risk of developing a major coronary event because of existing [CHD](/index.php/CHD) (65%), diabetes (Type 2, 26%; Type 1, 3%), history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease (16%), peripheral vessel disease (33%), or [hypertension](/index.php/Hypertension) in males 65 years (6%). At baseline, 3,421 patients (17%) had [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) levels below 100 mg/dL, of whom 953 (5%) had [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) levels below 80 mg/dL; 7,068 patients (34%) had levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL; and 10,047 patients (49%) had levels greater than 130 mg/dL. The HPS results showed that simvastatin 40 [CHD](/index.php/CHD) [stroke](/index.php/Stroke), and [revascularization](/index.php/Revascularization) procedures (coronary and non-coronary), see table below. Two composite endpoints were defined in order to have sufficient events to assess relative risk reductions across a range of baseline characteristics, see Figure 1. A composite of major coronary events (MCE) was comprised of [CHD](/index.php/CHD) mortality and non-fatal [MI](/index.php/MI) (analyzed by time-to-first event; 898 patients treated with simvastatin had events and 1,212 patients on placebo had events). A composite of major vascular events (MVE) was comprised of MCE, [stroke](/index.php/Stroke) and [revascularization](/index.php/Revascularization) procedures including coronary, peripheral and other non-coronary procedures (analyzed by time-to-first event; 2,033 patients treated with simvastatin had events and 2,585 patients on placebo had events). Significant relative risk reductions were observed for both composite endpoints (27% for MCE and 24% for MVE, p<0.0001). Treatment with simvastatin produced significant relative risk reductions for all components of the composite endpoints. The risk reductions produced by simvastatin in both MCE and MVE were evident and consistent regardless of [cardiovascular disease](/index.php/Cardiovascular_disease) related medical history at study without [CHD](/index.php/CHD)), gender, age, [creatinine](/index.php/Creatinine) levels up to the entry limit of 2.3 mg/dL, baseline levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apolipoprotein B and A-1, baseline concomitant cardiovascular medications (i.e., [aspirin](/index.php/Aspirin), [beta blockers](/index.php/Beta_blockers), or [calcium channel blockers](/index.php/Calcium_channel_blockers)), smoking status, alcohol intake, or [obesity](/index.php/Obesity). [Diabetics](/index.php/Diabetics) showed risk reductions for MCE and MVE due to simvastatin treatment regardless of baseline HbA1c levels or [obesity](/index.php/Obesity) with the greatest effects seen for diabetics without [CHD](/index.php/CHD). Angiographic Studies In the Multicenter Anti-Atheroma Study, the effect of simvastatin on [atherosclerosis](/index.php/Atherosclerosis) was assessed by quantitative [coronary angiography](/index.php/Coronary_angiography) in hypercholesterolemic patients with [CHD](/index.php/CHD). In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study, patients were treated with simvastatin 20 mg/day or placebo. [Angiograms](/index.php?title=Angiograms&action=edit&redlink=1) were evaluated at baseline, two and four years. The co-primary study endpoints were mean change per-patient in minimum and mean lumen diameters, indicating focal and diffuse disease, respectively. Simvastatin significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured in the Year 4 angiogram by both parameters, as well as by change in percent diameter [stenosis](/index.php/Stenosis). In addition, simvastatin significantly decreased the proportion of patients with new lesions and with new total occlusions. Modifications of Lipid Profiles - Primary Hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type lla and llb) - Simvastatin has been shown to be effective in reducing [total-C](/index.php/Cholesterol)and [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C)in heterozygous familial and non-familial [hyperlipidemia](/index.php/Hyperlipidemia). Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 4-6 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. Simvastatin consistently and decreased [total-C](/index.php/Cholesterol), [HDL-C](/index.php/HDL-C), see table below. - Simvastatin has been shown to be effective in reducing - Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV) - The results of a subgroup analysis in 74 patients with type lV [hyperlipidemia](/index.php/Hyperlipidemia)from a 130-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover study are presented in the table below. - The results of a subgroup analysis in 74 patients with type lV - Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type lll) - The results of a subgroup analysis in 7 patients with type lll [hyperlipidemia](/index.php/Hyperlipidemia)( [dysbetalipoproteinemia](/index.php/Dysbetalipoproteinemia)) crossover study are presented the table below. - The results of a subgroup analysis in 7 patients with type lll - Homozygous Familial Hyper [cholesterolemia](/index.php/Cholesterol) - In a controlled clinical study, 12 patients 15-39 years of age with homozygous familial hyper [cholesterolemia](/index.php/Cholesterol)received simvastatin 40 mg/day in a single dose or in 3 divided doses, or 80 mg/day in 3 divided doses. In 11 patients with reductions in [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C), the mean [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C)changes for the 40- and 80-mg doses were 14% (range 8% to 23%, 30% (range 14% to 46%, median 29%), respectively. One patient had an increase of 15% in [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C). Another patient with absent [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C)receptor function had an [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C)reduction of 41% with the 80-mg dose. - In a controlled clinical study, 12 patients 15-39 years of age with homozygous familial hyper - Endocrine Function - In clinical studies, simvastatin did not impair [adrenal](/index.php/Adrenal)reserve or significantly reduce basal plasma [cortisol](/index.php/Cortisol)concentration. Small reductions from baseline in basal plasma testosterone in men were observed in clinical studies with simvastatin, an effect also observed with other [statins](/index.php/Statins)and the bile acid sequestrant [cholestyramine](/index.php/Cholestyramine). There was no effect on plasma [gonadotropin](/index.php/Gonadotropin)levels. In a placebo-controlled, 12-week study there was no significant effect of simvastatin 80 mg on the plasma [testosterone](/index.php/Testosterone)response to human [chorionic gonadotropin](/index.php/Chorionic_gonadotropin). In another 24-week study, simvastatin 20-40 mg had no detectable effect on [spermatogenesis](/index.php/Spermatogenesis). In 4S, in which 4,444 patients were randomized to simvastatin 20-40 mg/day or placebo for a median duration of 5.4 years, the incidence of male sexual adverse events in the two treatment groups was not significantly different. Because of these factors, the small changes in plasma testosterone are unlikely to be clinically significant. The effects, if any, on the [pituitary](/index.php/Pituitary)- [gonadalaxis](/index.php/Gonadal)in pre-menopausal women are unknown. - In clinical studies, simvastatin did not impair Clinical Studies in Adolescents In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 175 patients (99 adolescent boys and 76 post-menarchal girls) 10-17 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) heterozygous familial [hypercholesterolemia ](/index.php/Hypercholesterolemia)(HeFH) were randomized to simvastatin (n=106) or placebo (n=67) for 24 weeks (base study). Inclusion in the study required a baseline [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) level between 160 and 400 mg/dL and at least one parent with an [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) level >189 mg/dL. The dosage of simvastatin (once daily in the evening) was 10 mg for the first 8 weeks, 20 mg for the second 8 weeks, and 40 mg thereafter. In a 24-week extension, 144 patients elected to continue therapy with simvastatin 40 mg or placebo. Simvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of [total-C](/index.php/Cholesterol), [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C), and Apo B see table below. Results from the extension at 48 weeks were comparable to those observed in the base study. After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean achieved [LDL-C](/index.php/LDL-C) value was 124.9 mg/dL (range: 64.0-289.0 mg/dL) 207.8 mg/dL (range: 128.0-334.0 mg/dL) in the placebo group. The safety and efficacy of doses above 40 mg daily have not been studied in children with HeFH. The long-term efficacy of simvastatin therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.
