Happy Customers Dr. Matthew Richter is a very knowledgeable, compassionate Chiropractor. I have been treated by Dr. Richter for various issues over the last 8 years and have always been very satisfied with the results. He is caring and sensitive to his patients and knows what treatment works for different conditions. I highly recommend Dr. Richter and his clinic. I want to thank you so much for your incredible help. I came into your office without an appointment, only an incredible pain shooting through my lower back that had been there all day. I woke up and knew something wasn't right, but I tried to get through the day. As a teacher who stands on her feet all day and travels, it was not an easy task. I have never in my life been in such constant, agonizing pain. Thankfully, I was seen that day, and after treatment, my pain lessoned. I came back the next day for treatment, and all that was left was a little soreness but no actual pain. I have continued for follow up treatments and have been feeling fantastic. My 2 year old son had severe reflux and asthma problems that were related to his reflux. He was on 6 different medications and 2 steroid inhalers. Dr. Richter gently adjusted him on two separate occasions and since the adjustments he has had no more symptoms. We took him off all medication and he is symptom free. Even through this tough winter he has had no breathing treatments. He can now live a normal healthy life of a 2 yr old. Thank you so much Dr. Richter. For over a year I suffered from lower back problems that caused pain down my leg. I wasn't able to stand for long periods of time, it hurt to lay down, and bending over was nearly impossible. I had been to the doctor several times, had x-rays, and physical therapy and nothing seemed to help. My mother suggested I try chiropractic and after the first adjustment I felt like a lot of pressure was released off my lower back. Dr. Richter decided to try decompression therapy and with every treatment the pain was less and less severe to the point where I didn't even notice the pain. I can now stand, sit and bend over with no pain. I am an athlete and my back was preventing me from working out and performing at my best. I now feel 100% and am able to squat and power clean with no irritation. I feel great! I was suffering from constant pain and inability to sleep well at night. I also was unable to take long walks with my husband. Dr. Richter suggested that I try decompression therapy for my back. Since I have been on the Spinal Decompression Program the pain is gone, I can take 3 mile walks and do normal house hold chores witout pain. The numbness in my toes has subsided as well. I was getting really intense migraines, my shoulder was bothering me on a daily basis and my fibromyalgia was acting up during the night, where I couldn't get a good night sleep. After treatment here with Dr. Richter, my back and shoulder do not bother me on a daily basis and my fibromyalgia does not act up as often as it did before. When it is bothering me I take some natural supplements that Dr. Richter suggested and it enables me to sleep without the pain. My activity levels have also gotten better with treatment. I can walk longer distances and I can enjoy life much more without the headaches. Also I am so happy and relieved not to be taking the prescription medication anymore. Dr. Richter cares so much about his patients and their well-being. Contact Us Frequently Asked Questions Are there any side effects or associated risks? How long does each treatment take?
