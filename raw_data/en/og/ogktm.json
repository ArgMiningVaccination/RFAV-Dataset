Steiner- Dillon* ABSTRACT \"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion,\" so the saying goes, \"but not to his own facts.\" Yet contemporary society is marked by a remarkable divergence of belief concerning matters of \"objective\" fact. This Article explores the phenomenon of \"epistemic pl uralism\" \u2014entrenched disagreement about matters of empirical fact \u2014from the perspective of John Rawls's work on political liberalism. Expanding on Rawls's discussion of reasonable pluralism among normative viewpoints, it argues that the persistence of episte mic pluralism poses challenges to the legitimacy of coercive state action analogous to the challenges that Rawls identified as arising from normative pluralism. The Article examines legal challenges to mandatory vaccination policies as a principal case stu dy of epistemic pluralism in the law. For over two hundred years, antivaccinationists have rejected the mainstream medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective and have opposed immunization mandates on both empirical and normative grounds. This Article develops a principle of \"epistemic public reason,\" which incorporates a principle of epistemic reasonableness by which to distinguish those epistemic viewpoints entitled to moral duties of civility and reciprocity by fellow citizens. Finding that mo st empirical objections to vaccination mandates are either directly or indirectly epistemically unreasonable, the Article concludes that the coercive imposition of immunization requirements on epistemic outliers is consistent with the principle of epistemi c public reason. It also clarifies more generally the nature and extent of public officials' obligation to offer reasons on contested empirical questions relevant to public policy that all reasonable citizens, including dissenters, can reasonably accept. * Assistant Professor of Law, University of Dayton School of Law.

INTRODUCTION \"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion,\" so the saying goes, \"but not to his own facts.\"2 Yet contemporary society is marked by a remarkable divergence of belief concerning matter s of \"objective\" fact. Many policy debates are characterized by disagreement not only about questions of normative value, but also about issues of empirical fact that seem to defy resolution. 3 Significant disagreement persists regarding the extent to which anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change,4 the ability of fetuses to feel pain when undergoing abortion,5 and the safety of genetically modified organisms for human consumption and for the environment , to name a few examples .6 Even the existence of a stable consensus of expert opinion is often insufficient to establish social consensus. Disagreement persists, viewpoints become entrenched, and adherence to a particular empirical belief becomes as central to a person's identity as their religious or political affiliation. This proliferation of disagreement on matters of empirical fact, which 1.

Drawing upon John Rawls's work on political liberalism,7 this Article contends that epistemic pluralism is endemic to the liberal state and raises many of the same questions concerning the legitimacy of coercive state action. Rawls argues that the moral legitimacy of democratically enacted policy is undermined when the coercive apparatus of the state is used to impose upon an individual an obligation grounded in a normative viewpoint that she cannot reasonably accept . Does the same threat to legitimacy arise when the dissenter's objection rests not on a normative viewpoint but rather on a disputed empirical claim ? If so, how might legislatures, courts, and ad ministrative agencies, all of which are routinely called upon to make decisions privileging some empirical propositions over others, make policy in a way that respects the moral duties of reciprocity and civility owed by members of a liberal democratic society to other members of the political community ? This Article addresses two questions unresolved by the existing literature: first, the extent to which the problem of legitimacy of state coercion in a liberal society extends to pluralism on the epistemic as well as the normative axis; second, the extent to which Rawls's solution to the problem in the normative context can be adapted to the problem of epistemic pluralism. This Article examine s epistemic pluralism in one of the many areas in which it has given rise to entrenched disagreement : legal challenges to mandatory vaccination requirements. Although a stable consensus of medical experts has held for over two centuries that vaccinations are one of the most cost -effective interventions for the protection of public health, 8 antivaccinationists have rejected this consensus and denied the effectiveness or safety of vaccinations since the earliest mass immunization programs were implemented in the nineteenth century. This disagreement of fa ct poses a challenge both for policymakers attempting to devise rational and effective public health policies and for courts called upon to resolve conflicts between individuals' objections to compulsory immunization and the state's interest in implementin g evidence- based public health policies for the benefit of the community. 7.

If the phenomenon of epistemic pluralism is analogous to the problem of normative plural ism that Rawls discusses , then we might expect to address it by adapting Rawls's principle of public reason to the epistemic context . Under such a principle, public decisions would be grounded in reasons that may be accepted by all citizens adhering to any \"reasonable\" epistemic viewpoint, where the bounds of epistemic reasonableness are defined by an overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemic methodologies. 9 This approach would be analogous to Rawls's solution to the problem of normative pluralism, whic h distinguishes comprehensive views grounded in the overlapping consensus of reasonable normative viewpoints from those outside that consensus,10 and would distinguish the types of empirical views to which others owe duties of reciprocity and civility from those \"unreasonable\" viewpoints to which no such duties are owed . It would also clarify the nature of the state's obligation to reasonable dissenters \u2014those whose methods of empirical knowledge construction share in the overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemic viewpoints, but who disagree with the majority's empirical conclusions in a particular instance. This Article develops a principle of epistemic public reason that articulates, on a constructivist basis analogous to Rawls's principle of normative p ublic reason, a criterion of reasonableness that distinguishes epistemic viewpoints that comprise the overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemic views from those that fall outside it. It contends that, at least with respect to the set of knowledge claim s characterized as \"scientific,\" 11 epistemic viewpoints are reasonable insofar as they recognize the primacy of an inductive mode of knowledge construction via the method of scientific empiricism that lies at the heart of the modern liberal consensus. Altho ugh articulating a specific \"scientific method\" has proven a notoriously tricky task for scientists and philosophers of science, it is unnecessary to do so with great precision for the purposes of this Article; the concept of \"reasonableness\" is a capaciou s one. We need only 9. It is important to note that the overlapping consensus of both normative and epistemic viewpoints is comprised of methodologies , not substantive views. Comprehensive viewpoin ts, as the name implies, are moral theories \u2014methods by which adherents arrive at answers to specific moral questions. As discussed below, the content of the epistemic overlapping consensus is likewise comprised of empirical methodologies. See infra Part II I. 10. RAWLS , supra note 7, at 15. 11. See infra Part III (defining \"scientific\" questions). 5Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019174 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 recognize that an epistemic viewpoint can violate the principle of epistemic reasonableness in two ways : first, by a direct rejection of scientific empiricism's privileged epistemic status in the construction of empirical knowledge ; second, by professing an empirical position that conforms to the form of the scientific empiricist mode of knowledge construction, but rejects the body of empirical knowledge that has accrued from the application of that method. In both these circumstances \u2014non- scientific and pseudoscientific unreasonableness \u2014the democratic majority is free to enact policies backed by the coercive force of law upon empirical premises grounded in scientific empiricism without regard to the unreasonable dissent of epistemic outli ers. Applying the principle of epistemic public reason to challenges to mandatory vaccination policies, this Article finds that most empirical antivaccinationist arguments are epistemically unreasonable in either the non-scientific or the pseudoscientific sense. Of the remainder \u2014the relatively small number of antivaccinationist views that accept the epistemic primacy of scientific empiricism and the settled body of knowledge concerning the safety and efficacy of vaccination constructed by that method\u2014 the p rinciple of epistemic public reason requires only that the state give reasons that such dissenters could recognize as legitimate. By definition, such dissenters recognize reasons grounded in the application of scientific empiricism as legitimate, even if t hey disagree with the majority's empirical conclusions concerning vaccination. Thus, the principle of epistemic public reason simultaneously clarifies the moral obligations owed by citizens in a liberal democracy to one another when disagreements about que stions of empirical fact and methodology arise, articulates a criterion of reasonableness by which to distinguish \"reasonable\" epistemic viewpoints, to which duties of reciprocity and civility are owed, from unreasonable viewpoints, and describes the natur e of the reasons that the majority must provide to reasonable epistemic dissenters. Expanding upon Rawls's focus on moral disagreement, it explains when, and to whom, reciprocity is owed in areas of factual disagreement. Most crucially, in this era of \"fak e news\" and polarized opinion about matters of scientific fact, it articulates a normative principle defining when and to whom such duties are not owed. Part I of this Article introduces Rawls's discussion of political liberalism and the problem of reasona ble pluralism, explaining Rawls's solution to that problem via the principle of public reason. Part I also elaborates upon the concept of epistemic pluralism as an omission from Rawls's account and asks whether the phenomenon of epistemic pluralism raises legitimacy concerns similar to those raised by the normative pluralism on which Rawls focuses. Part II discusses the history of mandatory vaccination and the normative and empirical debates 6University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 175 surrounding vaccinations , followed by an examination of judicial a nd legislative responses to challenges to mandatory vaccination policies. Part III assesses the extent to which the phenomenon of epistemic pluralism poses the same challenges to the legitimacy of majoritarian public policy as normative pluralism. It devel ops a principle of epistemic public reason and, applying that principle to the example of empirical disagreement about vaccination, demonstrates that most empirical antivaccinationist arguments are epistemically unreasonable . Part IV consider s other areas of doctrinal confusion as to which the principle of epistemic public reason could productively be applied. II. THE PROBLEMS OF NORMATIVE AND EPISTEMIC PLURALISM A. Normative Pluralism and the Overlapping Consensus In his later work, Rawls addressed what h e described as the fundamental question of political philosophy: \"how is it possible for there to exist over time a just and stable society of free and equal citizens, who remain profoundly divided by reasonable religious, philosophical, and moral doctrine s?\" 12 While he continued to believe that his own comprehensive doctrine of justice as fairness13 remained a reasonable comprehensive position, Rawls recognized that a key assumption underlying his work in A Theory of Justice \u2014that universal agreement on a single comprehensive moral or philosophical doctrine is achievable in principle in a democratic society characterized by freedom of conscience and expression \u2014was mistaken. Following his realization that \"a basic feature of democracy is the fact of reasonable pluralism \u2014the fact that a plurality of conflicting reasonable comprehensive doctrines, religious, philosophical, and moral, is the normal result of its culture of free institutions,\" 14 Rawls developed a theory of political liberalism \u2014a political conception of justice that seeks to articulate a model for social cooperation among citizens in a society characterized by reasonable pluralism. Rawls's solution to the problem of reasonable pluralism is to distinguish between the political conception of liberal democracy shared by all \"reasonable\" members of liberal democratic society and the diverse comprehensive views in which each individual's commitment to that 12.

He argues that, although the \"burdens of judgment\" in a society characterized by freedom of conscience preclude consensus on questions of ultimate moral value, there exists an overlapping consensus of reas onable comprehensive doctrines that lead their adherents to support what Rawls identifies as a \"reasonable\" conception of justice. 15 By emphasizing the shared values of the overlapping consensus and the family of reasonable political conceptions of justice derived from that consensus, citizens may put aside the disagreements between their comprehensive doctrines in order to participate in a society that embodies their shared political values and facilitates the goal of mutual cooperation.16 The fact of reason able pluralism as an inevitable and permanent feature of a liberal democratic system raises vexing questions concerning the legitimacy of coercive state policies imposed on dissenting members of the political community . The fundamental idea behind Rawls's principle of public reason is that legitimate political decisions involving \"constitutional essentials\" 17 and matters of \"basic justice\"18 must be justified by reasons that could be accepted by anyone who accepts the fundamental normative commitments of libe ral democracy. The principle is grounded in two related concepts democracy \u2014the duty of civility19 and the criterion of reciprocity20\u2014 that embody the fundamental principle of 15. RAWLS , supra note 7, at 131 -50. 16. Rawls offers the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An- Na'im as an example of how the political doctrine of liberal constitutionalism may be derived from comprehensive religious doctrine. An- Na'im writes that \"[t]he Qur'an does not mention constitutionalism, but huma n rational thinking and experience have shown that constitutionalism is necessary for realizing the just and good society prescribed by the Qur'an. An Islamic justification and support for constitutionalism is important and relevant for Muslims. Non-Muslims may have their own secular or other justifications.\" RAWLS , supra note 14, at 590 -91 n.46 (quoting ABDULLAHI AHMED AN-NA'IM, TOWARD AN ISLAMIC REFORMATION : CIVIL LIBERTIES , HUMAN RIGHTS , AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 52-57 (1990)); cf.

Const itutional essentials \"are of two kinds: (a) fundamental principles that specify the general structure of government and the political process; the powers of the legislature, executive and the judiciary; the scope of majority rule; and (b) equal basic right s and liberties of citizenship that legislative majorities are to respect; such as the right to vote and to participate in politics, liberty of conscience, freedom of thought and of association, as well as the protections of the rule of law.\" RAWLS , supra note 7, at 227. 18. Matters of basic justice \"relate to the basic structure of society and so would concern questions of basic economic and social justice and other things not covered by a constitution,\" RAWLS , supra note 14, at 575 n.7, and include \"such fundamental questions as: who has the right to vote, or what religions are to be tolerated, or who is to be assured of fair equality of opportunity, or to hold property.\" RAWLS , supra note 7, at 214. 19. \"[T]he ideal of citizenship imposes a moral, not a legal, duty\u2014 the duty of civility \u2014to be able to explain to one another on those fundamental questions how the principles and policies they advocate and vote for can be supported by the political values of public reason .\" R AWLS , supra note 7, at 217. 20. \"The criterion of reciprocity requires that when those terms are proposed as the most 8University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 177 mutual respect among democratic citizens. It emphasizes the special realm of politi cs as distinct from what Rawls terms the \"background culture,\" essentially the free -for-all marketplace of ideas in which comprehensive doctrines pursue ideological hegemony with little regard for fairness toward competing views .21 The principle of public reason also emphasizes the special responsibility placed on citizens as they exercise political authority through public debate and voting. A citizen engages in public reason \"when he or she deliberates within a framework of what he or she sincerely regards as the most reasonable political conception of justice, a conception that expresses political values that others, as free and equal citizens might also reasonably be expected reasonably to endorse.\" 22 This requirement of universal justifiability (within th e broad confines of the \"reasonable\") rests largely upon the concept of reciprocity and Rawls's view of society as a \"fair system of cooperation over time from one generation to the next, where those engaged in cooperation are viewed as free and equal citi zens and normal cooperating members of society over a complete life.\" 23 While it leads to surprising conclusions in this and other contexts,24 the principle of reciprocity is simply a recognition of the free and equal status of all citizens in a liberal soci ety.25 It is, in essence, an expression of respect for one's fellow citizens, acknowledging on the basis of their equal political standing that when decisions are made by majority vote, they should be made in a manner by which all reasonable citizens can un derstand the reasons behind the decision, even if they disagree with the majority's application of those reasons. reasonable terms of fair cooperation, those proposing them must also think it at least reasonable for others to accept them, as free and equal citizens, and not as domina ted or manipulated, or under the pressure of an inferior political or social position.\" RAWLS , supra note 14, at 576. 21. See id. at 576 n.1. 22. Id. at 581. Ronald Dworkin formulates the principle in a manner that emphasizes its relevance to the present inquiry: \"Public reason requires officials to offer justifications that are based on the political values of the community and not on comprehensive re ligious or moral or philosophical doctrines. The doctrine, therefore, requires judges searching for a justification of the law's structure to avoid controversial religious, moral, or philosophical doctrines.\" Ronald Dworkin, Rawls and the Law, 72 FORDHAM L.

Rawls notes that \"[t]here are many liberalisms and related views, and therefore many forms of public reason specified by a family of reasonable political conceptions . . . The limiting feature of these forms is the criterion of reciprocity, viewed as appli ed between free and equal citizens, themselves seen as reasonable and rational.\" RAWLS , supra note 14, at 581. 9Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019178 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 It is this manifestation of respect for the political autonomy of dissenters that Rawls argues bestows legitimacy on the decisions of electoral majorities pertaining to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice. 26 Non- public reasons, which are drawn from a comprehensive moral, religious, or philosophical doctrine s, are illegitimate grounds for political action because \"[t]here is n o reason why any citizen . . . should have the right to use state power to decide constitutional essentials as that person's . . . comprehensive doctrine directs.\"27 Because reasonable pluralism is a natural feature of liberal freedom of expression and of c onscience, if one accepts the premise that any political action pertaining to constitutional essentials or matters of basic justice must be justified by reasons that everyone, including dissenters, could reasonably accept, the very nature of liberal democr acy makes it impossible to justify any such action on the basis of a non -public reason. The failure to observe the principle of public reason effectively disenfranchises some group by imposing upon it a legal requirement that cannot be justified on any gro unds that its members might reasonably accept. This is particularly problematic when the group that does not share the comprehensive view of the legislative majority is the one most burdened by the policy in question. 28 Rawls argues that permitting such a coercive imposition of the majority's comprehensive values violates the duty of reciprocity, and insists that all political decisions affecting constitutional essentials or matters of basic justice be made in accordance with the principle of public reason. B. Epistemic Pluralism: An Omission from Rawls's Account 1. Epistemic Pluralism and Legitimacy Rawls's account of \"reasonable\" pluralism\u2014 which I will henceforth refer to as normative pluralism \u2014addresses a dilemma in g overning a complex, ideologically heterogeneous society in a morally legitimate way. But it significantly understates the scope of the problem in at least one respect. Rawls is correct that normative pluralism is an intrinsic feature of a liberal society c haracterized by free institutions, but his exclusive focus on the normative component overlooks a second source 26. \"Thus when, on a constitutional essential or matter of basic justice, all appropriate government officials act from and follow public reason, and when all reasonable citizens think of themselves ideally as if they were legislators following public reason, the legal enactment expressing the opinion of the majority is legitimate law.\" Id.; see also R AWLS , THEORY OF JUSTICE , supra note 13, at 253 . 27. RAWLS , supra note 7, at 226. 28. Cf. THOMAS CHRISTIANO , THE CONSTITUTION OF EQUALITY : DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY AND ITS LIMITS (2008) (discussing the problem of \"persistent minorities\" and democratic legitimacy). 10University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 179 of pluralism, which I shall refer to as epistemic pluralism. Epistemic pluralism refers to pluralism of beliefs not along the normative axis, which Rawls emphasized, but along the empirical one. Not only do citizens in a liberal democracy fundamentally disagree about questions of normative value, they also disagree to a significant extent about empirical facts. 29 These empirical beliefs can be as deeply held, as central to personal identity, and as resistant to reconsideration as the normative views on which Rawls focuses his discussion.30 The phenomenon of epistemic pluralism raises problems concerning the legitimacy of democratic governance analogo us to those posed by normative pluralism. If Rawls is correct that the coercive apparatus of the state cannot legitimately impose policies grounded in normative views that dissenters cannot reasonably accept, then it would seem to follow that such coercion is equally illegitimate when grounded upon empirical beliefs that dissenters reject . 2. Sources and Characteristics of Epistemic Pluralism Rawls was content simply to ascribe the inevitability of normative pluralism to the \"burdens of judgment\" and the o peration of \"free institutions\" in a liberal democratic state. 31 Without disagreeing with that ultimate conclusion, the more empirically oriented may wish to parse out how these mechanics lead to a permanent state of epistemic pluralism. This section briefly surveys the sources of empirical disagreement, examining how psychological features of human cognition and institutional features of liberal democracy work together to produce entrenched disagreement concerning matters of empirical fact. It will also consider whether, given the psychological linkages in the formation of normative and empirical beliefs, the distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism is conceptually viable. a. The Non- Ideal Burdens of Judgment Asking what can account for the pers istence of normative pluralism, Rawls discards the explanations that \"most people hold views that advance their own more narrow interests\" and that \"people are often 29.

The process of empirical belief formation is influenced by non - rational factors via a suite of psychological and other phenomena that collectively cause the p rocess of real -world belief formation to bear little resemblance to Rawls's rationalistic ideal. The human brain is not an ideal truth -producing device; it is a biological organ the structure, operation, and limitations of which have been shaped by eons of evolutionary pressure. 33 This pressure has not been uniformly toward veridicality of belief . By the logic of natural selection, the ability to form veridical beliefs is valuable only instrumentally, insofar as it contributes toward survival and reproduction. 34 Thus, veridicality of belief formation must be balanced against conservation of the scarce en ergy and resources necessary to operate a complex brain as well as scarcity of computational time when survival can depend on the ability to make decisions near -instantly. Our brains evolved to delegate much routine decision -making to cognitive heuristics \u2014rules of thumb that, evolutionarily speaking, make the \"right\" decision most of the time while conserving time and resources.35 Cognitive psychology describes two modes of thinking . The first (\"System 1\") is automatic, quick, and intuitive, while the secon d (\"System 2\") is slower, more deliberative, and requires the expenditure of mental effort.36 We rely on System 1 thinking constantly to form impressions and associations between ideas; it is fast, effortless, and often sufficient for moment- to-moment cognitive operations, but it is also prone to specious associations, flawed heuristics, and hasty generalization . 37 System 2 reasoning can work to correct the shortcomings of System 1, but because System 2 thinking requires the expenditure of mental effort, it can become 32.

Jus t as evolutionary pressures on the brain facilitated the development of adaptive but non- veridical heuristic decision making, so do social forces exert similar pressures on individuals. Such pressures act both affirmatively, by incentivizing individuals to hold or profess group - conforming empirical beliefs without regard to those beliefs' veridicality, and negatively, by disincentivizing individuals from investing substantial time and resources into improving the veridicality of their beliefs. 42 The affirma tive side of these social pressures involve a set of related phenomena that I will collectively refer to as cognitive tribalism . Perhaps the most significant manifestation of cognitive tribalism is \"identity protective cognition,\" that is, the tendency of individuals to espouse both empirical and normative views shared by some in -group with which they strongly identify. 43 Individuals' empirical beliefs are influenced by the 38.

Reject ing factual beliefs widespread within such a group can undermine individual well -being, either by threatening to estrange a person from his peers or by forcing that person to contemplate the social incompetence of those he identifies with. As a means of ps ychological self -defense, then, people tend to process information in a selective fashion that bolsters beliefs dominant within their self -defining groups. 45 Cognitive tribalism also manifests in the related phenomenon of cultural cognition , which describe s the manner in which individuals' normative commitments affect their perceptions of risk. As Kahan et al. explain, \"[t]his theory posits that people tend to conform factual beliefs about risk to their cultural evaluations of putatively dangerous behavior. As a result of various cognitive mechanisms, people are motivated to believe that behavior they find noble is also socially beneficial (or at least benign) and behavior they find base is also socially harmful.\" 46 The cultural cognition effect is vividly d emonstrated by Kahan et al.

Subjects displaying a \"hierarchical and individualist\" style were more likely to see the risk posed by Harris's driving as significant, to agree that the use of potentially lethal force against him was justified, and to blame Harris rather than the police. 50 Those whose style aligned with the \"egalitarian and communitarian\" type, however, were more likely \"to reject the conclusion that the police acted reasonably in using deadly force to terminate the chase.\" 51 Kahan et al. explain that these results are consistent with other studies \"w hich show that competing cultural outlooks of these varieties dispose people to disagree about the facts of all manner of putative dangers - from climate change to gun control to HPV vaccinations for school -age girls.\"52 Intelligence, access to information, and education are not correctives to cognitive tribalism; to the contrary, the polarizing effects of cultural and identity protective cognition tend to be positively associated with access to information and technical proficiency. 53 Nor is ideological polarization on empirical matters solely the result of overreliance on System 1 heuristics \u2014deliberative System 2 processes show the same vulnerability to identity -protective effects. 54 As individuals become more educated on scientific issues, they b ecome more adept at rationalizing scientific statements as compatible with their normative priors even when thinking deliberatively.

Indeed, it is usually rational for the typical voter not to invest substantial time and effort into understanding the facts of complex policy domains because individual voters have virtually no influence over public decision making. 57 Thus, political realities of attenuated democratic influence align with cognitive predilection to incentivize low expenditure of effort to acquire politically salient information and the identity -protective interpretation of such information one does acquire. These conditions are ripe for the development of network- centric epistemic pluralism. b.

But it is also true that the same conditions that give rise to a vibrant scientific culture also make the entren chment of diversity of opinion about empirical matters inevitable. Thus, some measure of epistemic pluralism is a fait accompli in liberal society. But an additional measure is contingent upon structures and institutions of contemporary society that go beyond the bare commitments of liberalism. This section will survey some of the major institutional contributors to the prevalence of epistemic pluralism in the United States. The foundation of entrenched epistemic pluralism in the United States is surely th e culture of political liberalism that Rawls identified. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states , in relevant part, that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" 59 This provision embodies an Enlightenment commitment to tolerance and rationalism and a belief in the truth -seeking tendencies of human reason and discourse. Although the First Amendment's guarantees have been far from uniformly respected, and its normative contours remain contested,60 the constitutional commitment to freedom of conscience and the culture of tolerance of which it is both a cause and an effect is essential to the flourishing of epistemic pluralism. The absence of state- imposed orthodoxy gives free rein to the \"burdens of judgment\" in a way that inevitably increases the divers ity of empirical viewpoints within the society. Other factors are not fundamental to the liberal democratic state, but arise from contingencies of political and technological development. For example, significant disparities in access to, and quality of, e ducation no doubt contribute to the scope of disagreement on empirical matters. If access to education is a scarce resource, its inequitable distribution facilitates the conditions for entrenched epistemic pluralism .

About 29% have either an associate's degree or some college credits without a degree. Twenty percent of Americans' highest educational attainment is a 4 -year bachelor's degree, and only 11% of Americans over 18 had a graduate degr ee\u2014 including master's, professional, and doctoral degrees. 62 But those numbers only begin to illustrate the disparities of educational attainment that characterize the contemporary United States . Figure 1 further summarizes the census data with respect to e ach of the major census racial or ethnic categories \u2014non- Hispanic whites, Asian Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics. The results are striking. Asian Americans, the group with the highest educational attainment, are almost three times more likely tha n African Americans to hold a post -graduate degree (21.8% vs. 7.7%), and over five times more likely than Hispanics (21.8% vs. 4.2%). To the extent that epistemic injustices in access to education are associated with such identity -constitutive demographic categories as race, class, gender, or political affiliation, they have the potential to exacerbate the entrenchment of epistemic pluralism by transmuting demographic communities into epistemic ones. 63 Closely related to inequalities in access to education i s the highly 62.

Years of study and substantial expense are necessary to obtain expertise in a single, narrow domain; few individuals ever achieve that status, and only a vanishingly small number can claim expertise in mor e than one domain. Everyone is a layperson in nearly all domains, victims of humanity's success in generating more cumulative knowledge than can be processed by a single mind within a single lifetime. 64 The production of knowledge has become primarily a collective rather than an individual undertaking , with the consequence that we are all epistemically dependent on others.65 The result of this epistemic fragmentation has been the development of persistent epistemic communities around narrow domains of experti se, creating further space for epistemic pluralism to flourish. All of these effects have been facilitated by innovations in communications technology. At least since the Protestant Reformation's savvy utilization of the nascent printing industry, 66 advances in communications technology have made the dissemination of ideas ever faster, cheaper, and simpler \u2014with predictable consequences for the expansion of pluralism, both normative and epistemic. Pamphlets, local newspapers, mass -produced books, radio, broad cast and cable television all contributed to a world in which communication was easier and less subject to the control of centralized authorities. 67 From one perspective, the Internet is simply the latest incremental step in the direction of cheap, unconstr ained communication; from another, it has been a revolution. For the first time in history, a large segment of the human population has access to a near -global communications platform that bypasses even the private gatekeepers like publishers, academic pee r reviewers, newspaper editors, and broadcast executives that constrained viewpoint diversity in 64.

Older, more conservative users were significantly more likely to be exposed to and to share content from fake news sources. 75 Moreover, there is some indication that fake news \u2014perhaps due to its contrived alignment with its target audience's political identity \u2014is more readily prone to being shared, and therefore spreads faster through the online through covert Twitter accounts and Facebook pages, to assist Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones in the 2017 special election in Alabama.

Can a meaningful line be drawn between an individual's normative views and her empirical beliefs, or are the two so inextricably intertwined as to confound any attempts to distinguish pluralism grounded in comprehensive normative views from that grounded in empirical disagreement? Does every apparent disagreement about empirical fact ultimately reduce to a disagreement about values ? If so, then a justification for Rawls's omission of epistemic pluralism from his account of political liberalism is apparent : epistemic pluralism is not conceptually distinct from the \"reasonable pluralism\" that Rawls discusses, and it need not be addressed separately. In considering this question, we must be clear about the sense in which we mean that a superficially empirical disagreement \"reduces\" to one about normative value. If we designate the claim that superficially factual disagreements can be explained by deeper disagreement about matters of normative value \"normative reductivism ,\" we can articulate that claim in a strong and a weak sense: Strong normative reductivism : Every aspect of a superficially empirical disagreement reduces completely to one or more disa greements about normative value. Disagreements about value explain all variation in belief concerning the superficially empirical disagreement. Weak normative reductivism : Some aspects of a superficially empirical disagreement may reduce to disagreements about normative value, but the empirical component does not reduce completely . At least some variation in belief concerning the superficially empirical disagreement cannot be explained by disagreements about value. Many superficially empirical disagreemen ts are characterized at least by weak normative reductivism. As discussed in Part I(B)(2)(a), t he distinction between \"fact\" and \"value\" is complicated by the bidirectional influence in belief formation of \"ought\" and \"is.\" Individuals' beliefs concerning matters of \"objective\" fact can be heavily influenced by their prior normative commitments , and their normative conceptions of the good are often informed by their beliefs about the external world. The conceptual viability of the distinction between epistemic and normative pluralism, however, depends on whether all superficially empirical disagreements are characterized by strong normative reductivism. An affirmative answer would require rejecting this Article's taxonomy of pluralisms ; if individuals' norm ative priors c ompletely determine their empirical beliefs in all cases , then a conceptual distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism would be spurious . There are some superficially empirical disagreements in which an explanation grounded in stro ng normative reductivism seems plausibly sufficient \u2014 for example, the claim that President Obama was \"a gay Muslim from 23Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019192 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 Kenya working to undermine the United States,\"82 or some pro -life activists' arguments that developing fetuses are capable of feeling th e pain during the abortion procedure earlier in the pregnancy than is recognized by the mainstream medical consensus.83 But to acknowledge that strong normative reductivism explains superficial empirical disagreement in some cases does not resolve the inquiry. At least some empirical disagreements are only weakly normatively reductive, and some are not normatively reducti ve at all. To take a simple example, the statement \" that dog is a Boston Terrier\" is an empirical one insofar as it deals with an issue of fact about the external world, and is one about which disagreement could exist, but it is unlikely that such disagree ment is driven by submerged conflicts of value. Perhaps you are a subtler judge of variations among similar breeds than I; perhaps you have better recall of the relevant reference materials, or have greater experience with this particular breed. In any eve nt, it is unlikely, even if I never accept your view as correct, that our disagreement is driven by anything deeper than divergent applications of the agreed criteria by which dog breeds are identified. But this is a simple question; it is unlikely to gene rate widespread dissensus across decades or generations. As inquiry becomes more general , causal relationships more attenuated, and the social or political stakes of the issue higher, the tendency toward normative reductivism increases. Nevertheless, even within the set of complex empirical questions that give rise to the problem of entrenched epistemic pluralism, some disagreements are only weakly normatively reductive. \"Strong\" and \"weak\" normative reductivism, of course, are opposite ends of a spectrum rather than distinct principles. Figure 2 depicts them visually on a horizontal axis, with the \"weak\" end of normative reductivism on the left side of the axis and the \"strong\" side on the right. Arrayed along the line are several propositions in increasin g order of normative reductivism, ranging from \"That dog is a Boston Terrier\" on the weak end to \"Obama is a gay Muslim\" on the strong end. 84 The dashed vertical line in the center represents the point at which normative reductivism predominates \u2014that is, th e point at which a superficially 82.

The placement of propositions concerning anthropogenic climate change and genetically modified organisms in Figure 2 is for illustrative purposes only. While their placement represents my best assessment of the degree of normative reductiveness of the seem ingly empirical disagreements around those issues, defending those assessments is beyond the scope of this Article. Even if I am incorrect in those particulars, the conceptual illustration of partial normative reductivism would remain viable. 24University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 193 empirical disagreement is mostly explained by conflicting normative values. How can we distinguish the degree of normative reductivism in a superficially empirical disagreement? A useful heuristic is to hold moral disagreement constant \u2014to ask whether the parties to the disagreement share the same set of fundamental normative commitments. If so, then a disagreement about empirical claims is unlikely to be reducible to a conflict of values. While the question of which debates feature a broadly shared set of normative commitments is itself an empirical one as to which we have little direct evidence, the case study selected for this Article, concerning the debate around the safety and efficacy of vaccination, falls comfortably into this category. Notwithstanding the constructed and contingent nature of any normative vision of health, 85 antivaccinationists and the mainstream medical community appear to broadly agree on what constitutes optimal health ; their disagreement arises prima rily with respect to the question whether the practice of immunization is causally associated with what they mutually agree constitute \"better\" or \"worse\" health outcomes.86 If it is the case that some empirical disagreements are only weakly normatively red uctive, then it is also the case that a conceptual distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism can be usefully maintained . 85.

HEALTH & SOC. BEHAV . 34 (1995). 86. Proponents and opponents of vaccination largely agree that such conditions as measles, smallpox, and autism constitute sub -optimal health outcomes. As Kirkland points out, mainstream e xperts and antivaccination activists differ in their conception of autism as a matter of pre -birth \"wiring\" or environmental \"injury,\" but both agree that it is a departure from optimal cognitive health. ANNA KIRKLAND , VACCINE COURT : THE LAW AND POLITICS OF INJURY 174- 76 (2016). However, the social constructedness of any conception of health is demonstrated by the \"neurodiversity\" movement, which contends that autism is not a \"disease\" to be cured but rather as a \"naturally occurring cognitive variation[] with distinctive strengths.\" STEVE SILBERMAN , NEUROTRIBES : THE LEGACY OF AUTISM AND THE FUTURE OF NEURODIVERSITY 16 (2015). 25Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019194 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 Psychological evidence likewise suggests that the premise of universal strong normative reductivism is false. Consider, for example, Kahan's study of politicized belief concerning anthropogenic climate change.87 Kahan's results showed an unmistakable association between political ideology, \"ordinary science intelligence,\" and the likelihood of giving a corre ct answer to the question whether climate change is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors. 88 \"[T]he likelihood of a correct response sloped downward for individuals who were conservative Republicans: at a +1 [standard deviation on the ordinary science i ntelligence scale] score, the predicted probability of a correct answer was only 13% . . . for such individuals \u2014as opposed to 90% for liberal Democrats.\" 89 Evidence of substantial normative reductivism, surely, but not of the complete normative reductivism that would obviate the distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism. Other evidence suggesting that particular cognitive styles can mitigate the effects of cognitive tribalism further supports the view that at least some empirical disagreements ar e only weakly normatively reductive. Tetlock, for example, shows that some cognitive styles are better at applying empirical evidence to make accurate predictions , whether compatible with the individual's normative preferences or not. 90 Evaluating the ability of political experts to make accurate predictions within their own fields, Tetlock finds that [l]ow scorers [on measures of predictive calibration and discrimination] look hedgehogs: thinkers who \"know one big thing,\" aggressi vely extend the explanatory reach of that one big thing into new domains , display bristly impatience with those who \"do not get it,\" and express considerable confidence that they are already pretty proficient forecasters, at least in the long term. High sc orers look like foxes: thinkers who know many small things (tricks of their trade), are skeptical of grand schemes , see explanation and prediction not as deductive exercises but rather as exercises in flexible \"ad hocery\" that require stitching together di verse sources of information, and are rather diffident about their own forecasting prowess.91 Similarly, Kahan et al. 's recent work explaining the virtues of \"science curiosity\" \u2014\"a general disposition . . . that reflects the motivation to seek out and consume scientific information for personal pleasure\" \u2014 as a corrective to the polarizing effects of cognitive tribalism suggests that a 87.

III. LEGAL CHALLENGES TO MANDATORY VACCINATION POLICIES : A CASE STUDY IN EPISTEMIC PLURALISM In late December 2014 and early January 2015 , the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California - the \"happiest place on Earth\" - became the site of an outbreak of measles that eventually affected 125 victims across eight states and three nations.93 Nearly half (45%) of the victims of the outbreak wit hin California were unvaccinated, including infants too young to receive the measles -mumps- rubella (\"MMR\") vaccination, as well as children with medical contraindications to vaccination.94 Sixty- seven percent of the unvaccinated victims were \"intentionally unvaccinated because of personal beliefs.\" 95 Although, in the end, the total number of reported cases of measles in the United States in 2015 was in line with previous years and was a significant dropoff from the spike of cases reported in 2014, 96 the 92.

Figure 3 illustrates trends in searches on the Google search engine for the term \"measles\" from 2004 through 2018. It indicates that public interest was relatively flat for nearly the entire period, with a sharp spike beginning in December 2014 and peaking in February 2015, concurrent with the Disneyland outbreak. Popular attention turned to vaccine refusal as a cause of the occurrence and longevity of the Disneyland outbreak, 97 and subsequent analysis confirmed that a lack of vaccination among the exposed population played a role in spreading the disease. 98 Although immunization rates greater than 96% are necessary to achieve \"herd immunity\" against measles, epidemiological analysis found that immunization rates among the exposed population were \"as low as 50% and likely no higher than 86%.\" 99 The public outcry in response to the Disneyland outbreak motivated the California legislature to reconsider the longstanding \"personal belief\" exemption to its vaccination requirement. 100 The legislature quickly passed S.B. 277, which repealed the state's statutory exemption to its general requirement that children obtain certain vaccines in order to attend public sch ools where the child's parent or guardian affirmed that CTRS.

This Part examine s the history of that battle as a case study in the law's treatment of epistemic pluralism. Mandatory vaccination requirements present an ideal case study for several reasons. The consensus of medical opinion for over two centuries has held that vaccines are effective and, although not without risk, generally safe at preventing far greater risks associated with vaccine - preventable disease. Legally mandated vaccination policies have shown great success at reducing the prevalence of such diseases as smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and others, saving countless lives and d ollars. 104 On the other hand, vaccination involves the 101.

Recently, Maine and New York have also abolished their religious or personal belief exemptions. See infra note 240. The public controversy did not end with the enactment of S.B. 277. State authorities discovered that physicians sympathetic to the antivaccinationist cause were granting unwarranted medical exemptions to children with no medical contraindications to immunization. In September 2019, the state enacted S.B. __, which creates a standardized medical exemption form, creates a system by which to monitor \"unusually high\" exemption certificates by particular physicians, and provides state health officials the authority to revoke \"inappropriate or invalid\" medical exemptions.

Others, however, objected on empirical grounds. 107 While the specifics of antivaccinationist empirical objections have shifted over time, they have consistently rejected either the premise that vaccin es are effective in preventing disease, the premise that the medical benefits of vaccines, even if effective at prevention, outweigh the risks of harm caused by vaccination, or both. Legal authorities' responses to antivaccinationist objections to mandator y immunization requirements have closely tracked the distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism. Although never expressed in such terms, state legislatures have proven generally willing to grant exemptions to immunization requirements to individ uals whose objections are grounded in normative principles, but have uniformly denied exemptions to those who se objections are grounded in empirical doubts concerning vaccines' safety or efficacy. Courts, while denying rights -based exemptions grounded in n ormative or epistemic pluralism, have nevertheless embraced that distinction insofar as they have become active enforcers of the lines drawn by legislatures . Courts closely examine putative claims for exemption and deny \"religious\" or \"philosophical\" objections that they determine to be pretexts for empirical objections. A.

Through the principle of \"herd immunity,\" in which a cr itical mass of immunized individuals protects the entire population by preventing disease from gaining a foothold from which to spread, 110 vaccination is credited with eliminating or significantly reducing the incidence of such life-threatening diseases as s mallpox, polio, measles, and pertussis.111 Widespread vaccination has been widely credited with saving countless lives and was recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century. 112 In the United States, state and municipal authorities have enacted mandatory vaccination requirements in response to disease outbreaks since the early nineteenth century.113 The development of routinized immunization requirements applicable in non -epidemic circumstances came a bit later, and such policies have generally been limited to three groups: public school children, health care workers, and members of the military. 114 Of these, mandates pertaining to public school students have been the most c ontroversial and have generated the most significant legal challenges. The first such requirement was imposed by the city of Boston in 1827, which required public school students to provide a certificate of immunization against smallpox. 115 Hodge and Gostin survey the spread of mandatory vaccination requirements for public school attendance during the 19th century: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts incorporated its own school vaccination law in 1855, New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, and Pennsylvania in 1895. Other northeast states soon passed their own requirements. The trend toward compulsory child vaccination as a condition of school attendance eventually spread to states in the Midwest (e.g., Indiana (1881), Illinois and Wisconsin (1882), Iowa (1889)), South (e.g., Arkansas and Virginia (1882)), and West (e.g., INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THE VARIOLAE VACCINAE (1796). 110.

Themes in Antivaccinationist Argument Although the Jennerian method of immunization was quickly accepted by the mainstream medical establishment of the early nineteenth century, opposition soon arose among the public an d alternative medical communities.122 Antivaccinationist sentiment has waxed and waned since then, experiencing periods of relative popularity and others in which the public largely accepted the mainstream medical community 's consensus that vaccines are a s afe and effective method of preventing disease. 123 On the whole, though, antivaccinationist sentiment for the past two centuries has been remarkably consistent in its major themes.

The effectiveness of the vaccine itself led to a progressive, albeit apathetic, argument: since the vaccine has worked, why should individuals continue to be subjected to the harms of vaccination unless there exists an actual threat of disease in the community? Public health authorities were ch aracterized as abusive, untrustworthy, and paternalistic. Resisting public health efforts was equated with fighting government oppression. Antivaccinationists asserted that vaccinations . . . were contrary to their sacred religious beliefs. 124 Three major categories of argument recur red in antivaccinationist opposition to the practice of immunization in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: (1) Medical disagreements consisting of (a) empirical doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines or about the severity of the diseases they purport to prevent, and (b) competing claims to legitimacy between the mainstream medical establishment, represented foremost by the American Medical Association (AMA), and various \"alternative\" medical practitioners; (2) moral or religious disagreements consisting of (a) appeals to liberty or human rights against mandatory vaccination, and (b) appeals to God or natural law against the introduction of \"unnatural\" or \"unclean\" matter into the body; and (3) ad hominem attacks on the motives of the mainstream medical establishment, generally consisting of variations on the claim that mainstream physicians intentionally perpetuate disease for the sake of financial gain.125 Although the contemporary vaccination debate is heavily influenced by the relatively recent assertion that vaccination is causally associated with the development of childhood autism,126 these themes guide contemporary antivaccination discourse just as they did in the nineteenth century. Details have changed, but the broad thrust of antivaccinationist rhetoric \u2014both normative and empirical \u2014has remained virtually unaltered for nearly 200 years. This section survey s each of the major themes in antivaccinationist argument from the earliest days through the present, while the next section focuses on recent shifts in tone brought about by Dr. Andrew Wakefield's claim, in 1998, to have identified a causal relationship between childhood vaccination and the development of autism. 124.

Empirical Doubts Concerning the Safety or Efficacy of Vaccines The principal empirical objection that antivaccinationists raise against the practice of vaccination is that it does no good; that is, vaccination fails to prevent disease as the medical establishment claims. This was a recurrent theme of antivaccinationist advocacy against the smallpox vaccine, made somewhat more plausible by the fact that the germ theory of dis ease remained inconclusively established in the nineteenth century. Nineteenth century antivaccinationists tended to reject the germ theory in favor of the \"miasmatic\" theory of disease, which held that diseases \"spontaneously generated in dirt and filth,\" and therefore argued that greater public sanitation would reduce the risk of smallpox epidemics more effectively than vaccination. 127 Like their nineteenth and twentieth century forebears, contemporary antivaccinationists assert that some, if not all, vacc ines are ineffective at preventing disease .128 Kata's content analysis of antivaccinationist websites found that 88% of sites raised doubts concerning the efficacy of vaccination, including \"propositions that vaccination weakens the immune system, or that im munity is ineffective because vaccinated individuals still contract diseases.\" 129 A second argument that antivaccinationists commonly use is that, even if a vaccine is effective at preventing the disease in question, it also causes some worse disease or con dition. Antivaccinationists in the nineteenth century attributed all sorts of unwholesome effects to the smallpox vaccine. Kaufman recounts, for example, the arguments of Dr. J.F. Banton, \"who wrote that vaccination introduces into the bloodstream 'a biopl asm, death laden\u2014 carrying with it all the vices, passions and diseases of the cow,'\" 130 and Dr. H.

For example, Keelan et al. 's study of YouTube videos concerning vaccinat ion found that substantial percentages of antivaccination ist videos stated that immunization frequently caused serious adverse events, permanent injury, or autism. 134 Kata's content analysis of antivaccinationist websites found that \"every [antivaccinationi st] site claimed that vaccines are poisonous and cause idiopathic illnesses,\" 135 which aligns with Wolfe et al. 's finding that 100% of antivaccinationist websites \"included content suggesting that vaccines cause idiopathic illness.\" 136 Another common antivaccinationist tactic since the nineteenth century has been to minimize the threat of vaccine preventable disease . Kaufman quotes antivaccinationist J.F. Banton, who \"wrote that smallpox was a 'disease not so much to be dreaded as we are wont to believe, leavi ng the system in much healthier condition than most other diseases.'\" 137 Similarly, \"Bernarr Macfadden wrote that the disease was possible only to those who 'clothe heavily, bathe infrequently, eat very heartily and As Kaufman observes, \"[s]uch an argument obviously makes one wonder exactly what are the vices and passions of the cow.\" Id. 131.

Some maintain, for example, that influenza,140 chicken pox,141 and even measles142 are relatively harmless, or that \"natural\" immunity resulting from infection with a disease is \"better\" than the immunity created by vaccination. 143 Half of the antivaccinationist webs ites in Kata's sample argued that vaccine- preventable diseases are \"trivial .\"144 b. Competing Claims to Legitimacy Among Rival Epistemic Communities The debate over vaccination has been one front in the larger struggle for power and legitimacy between the mainstream medical community, represented by the AMA , 145 and adherents to various alternative schools of medical theory.146 Those battle lines were drawn in the nineteenth century, when opposition to the mainstream medical community's consensus in favor of vaccination as a safe and effective preventative measure provided \"irregular\" physicians with an opportunity to critique 138.

Many of the leading actors in the antivaccinationist movement of the ninet eenth and early twentieth centur ies had a professional interest in diminishing the credibility of the mainstream as well as a financial interest in marketing their own alternative treatments to smallpox. The public debates over vaccination became something of a proxy war between competing visions of the medical profession and divergent institutional logics, which were further associated with disagreements concerning the legitimate role of state authority in maintaining public health. Kaufman recounts, for e xample, a history of the American Medical Liberty League (the \"League\") , formed in 1918, which during the course of its existence \"opposed vaccination, medical licensure, isolation of contagious diseases, pure food and drug laws, the testing of cattle with tuberculin, and a host of other public health programs.\" 148 The vice president of the League was Eli G. Jones, \"who had been a practitioner of every medical system, 'allopathic, homeopathic, eclectic, physio- medical and was D.W. Ensign, \"the owner and manager of Ensign Remedies, a patent medicine mail order house in Battle Creek, Michigan.\" 149 In the twenty -first century, the battle for legitimacy continues to rage between the mainstream and alternative medical practitioners, and the vaccination debate continues to be a significant point of engagement in that conflict.150 Modern -day irregulars, including, among others, chiropractors, 151 homeopaths, and naturopaths,152 continue to challenge 147.

Contemporary antivaccinationists, like their forebears, are firmly on the side of the irregulars, as they commonly recommend methods for the prevention and cure of disease that are rejected by the mainstream medical establishment. 153 This epistemic divergence goes beyond professional boundary work to expose a pluralism of epistemolog ical methodology; 38% of antivaccinationist websites in Kata's content analysis, for example, promoted \"[s]ources of knowledge such as personal intuition ... while biomedical information was portrayed as erroneous; parents were urged to not to allow biomedi cal fear -mongering to overshadow their own instincts.\" 154 c. Appeals to Liberty Opponents of mandatory vaccination policies frequently phrase their appeals in terms of physical or intellectual freedom. In the nineteenth century, antivaccinationists invoked t he specter of human slavery, analogizing the state's authority over the bodies of African -American slaves to its imposition of mandatory vaccination requirements. For example, nineteenth century British antivaccinationist William Tabb lamented, upon being required to submit to shipboard vaccination while in transit to the United States, that \"America was closed against the unvaccinated anti- vaccinator, and that he was fast falling into the condition of the American negro -slave who was hunted down by everybody.\" 155 J.W. Hodge echoed Tabb's sentiment while speaking before the Western New York Homeopathic Medical Society, contend ing that state -mandated immunization \"'ranks with human slavery and religious persecution as one of the most flagrant outrages upon the rights of the human race.'\"156 general antipathy with conventional medicine, apprehension of detrimental side effects of immunization, and the opinio n that their own practices provide better, natural protection that 'obviates the need for vaccination.'\"). 153.

An online petition titled \"Universal Declaration of Resistance to Mandatory Vaccination s,\" for example, declares that \"as Freemen & Freewomen ... [the petitioners'] bodies are sovereign territory and subject to our self -determination.\"157 Similarly, radio personality Alex Jones's website identified the fact that \"the government forces us to shoo t our kids full of vaccines\" as among the most serious threats to American liberty.158 Indeed, the rhetoric of personal liberty and bodily freedom permeates throughout antivaccinationist discourse in the twenty -first century, which depicts vaccine refusal as a matter of individual liberty of conscience against an overreaching and intrusive public health apparatus. 159 d. Religious or Moral Arguments Antivaccinationists from the nineteenth century to the present day have also invoked God and morality in their op position to coerced immunization. These arguments take several forms. Some argue that disease and death represent God's judgment or will and therefore should be accepted; others contend that the human body's natural immune system is divinely created and is defiled by vaccination. Some religious sects oppose vaccination as a matter of formal doctrine; many antivaccinationists, however, ground their objection in personal religious principle even when the religious sect to which they adhere has no formal opposition to immunization. Invocations of the divine plan were common to nineteenth century religious arguments. Antivaccinationists of that era contended either that arguments appealed to libertarian first principles. Willrich, for example, quotes J.M. Peebles's declaration that \"upon the constitutional grounds of personal liberty, no vaccination doctor, lancet in one hand and calf-pox poison in the other, has a legal or moral right to enter the sacred precincts of a healthy home and scar a child's body for life.\" Willrich, supra note 116, at 82. 157.

Religious antivaccinationist Leonard Horowitz, for example, writes that \"parents who elect to forego [the] risks\" associated with vaccination, \"in celebration to God and his blessings,\" will be rewarded with a \"healthy and natural immunity.\" 162 Others raise more specific objections, for example the use of fetal cell lines in the manufacture of some vaccines.163 Religious and moral themes were less common among the antivaccinationist websites in Kata's content analyses than the other themes discussed here, but 25% of the sample contained explicitly religious advocacy against vaccination, and 38% \"assocat[ed] vac cines with morally dubious actions.\" 164 Even the Malthusian trappings of nineteenth -century antivaccinationism, long banished from respectability, continue to slip covertly into the antivaccinationist worldview. Reich's qualitative study of antivaccinationis t mothering practices, for example, finds that many such mothers rely on \"imagined gated communities\" \u2014 including the scrupulous curation of their child's social networks to exclude \"unsafe 'outsiders' who carry disease\" \u2014as a superior alternative to immuniza tion. 165 160.

Conspiracy Theories and Ad Hominem Arguments As noted above, the vaccination debate can be understood in part as one battlefield in the larger struggle for legitimacy between the mainstream and alternative medical communities. It is therefore unsurprising that one strand of antivaccinationist argument moves beyond the empirical assessment of vaccines' safety and medical efficacy to attack the motives and intentions of vaccination proponents. This line of argument depicts proponents of vaccination whether physicians who recommend immunization or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture and sell vaccines, as not merely factually mistaken about the safety and utility of vaccination, but as engaged in a conspiracy against public health for the sake of their own financial interests. 166 As Kaufman notes, such arguments were common in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: The Pittsburgh Health Club, for example, which had become a center of anti-vaccination and anti -allopathic sentiment, published a pamphlet which stated that in 1924 the local physicians had amassed more than three million dollars by vaccinating the poor, and to add to their crime, they caused an epidemic of smallpox to strike the steel city . An American Medical Liberty League leafle t noted similarly that the vaccinators in Kansas City had \"raked in over half a million dollars\" in 1922, and the author commented that \"considering the profits, why should not all medical doctors advocate vaccination?\" Anti -vaccinationists constantly accu sed allopaths of starting what they called \"vaccination rings,\" monopolies of the regular doctors formed in order to reap the financial benefits of compulsory vaccinations. 167 Contemporary antivaccinationists continue to employ ad hominem arguments and consp iracy theories alleging that mainstream practitioners and \"Big Pharma\" knowingly exaggerate the effectiveness and understate the risks of vaccines in order to maximize their own wealth.168 Also common is the allegation of conflict of interest against researc hers whose work on the safety or efficacy of vaccination is funded in part by pharmaceutical companies. These arguments at times veer into broader conspiracy theories concerning government control and the intentional infringement of individual liberties th rough mandatory immunization requirements. Dr. Joseph Mercola, for example, decries \"Big Pharma['s] 166. See Willrich, supra note 116, at 81. 167. Kaufman, supra note 107 , at 474 (internal citations omitted).

The Autism Controversy: 1998 - Present The anti -vaccination movement entered its current phase on February 28, 1998, with the publication of a study by Andrew Wakefield et al. in The Lancet.173 The Wakefield Study purported to identify an association between receipt of the measles, mumps, and rubella (\"MMR\") vaccination and the development of intestinal inflammation and autism in 169.

In a time of rising and unexplained autism diagnosis,174 the study claimed that parents a nd the medical establishment were inflicting neurological disorder upon infants by injecting them with pathogens and \"toxins\" in vaccines . This claim preyed upon parents' anxieties for their children's health and the public's fears about the obscure and at times sinister -sounding contents of some vaccines, particularly MMR. While the Wakefield Study immediately captured the attention of the public and the popular press, the mainstream medical community was skeptical that childhood vaccination was a causal a gent in the development of autism. Subsequent studies called Wakefield's conclusions into question, 175 and 10 of the study's 12 co -authors disavowed its claimed causal association between MMR and autism.176 Numerous studies failed to replicate the finding of an association between immunization and autism.177 Taken together, these replication studies establish almost conclusively that childhood vaccination does not cause autism. As the medical community directed its initial criticism toward the Wakefield Study 's flawed methodology and the irreproducibility of its results, allegations of fraud and conflicts of interest against Wakefield personally began to surface in the mainstream press. Beginning in 2004 and continuing through 2012, the London Times ran a series of articles identifying a number of ethical conflicts and lapses in the conduct and reporting of the Wakefield Study. 178 The investigation discovered, for example, that Wakefield failed to disclose that the study was funded by lawyers represent ing a group of parents who believed their children's autism had been caused by the MMR vaccine or that Wakefield himself was in the process of patenting a separate measles vaccine that would compete with MMR. 179 Contrary to his assurances to the research oversight board, Wakefield ordered a number of tests \u2014including 174.

In 2002, the Vaccine Court consolidated those claims into a single proceeding known as the Omnib us Autism Proceeding (\"OAP\"). 196 Throughout the OAP litigation, the petitioners asserted two theories of general causation: first, that the combination of the MMR vaccine and other vaccines containing thimerosal, a mercury -based preservative that at the time was used in some vaccines (but not MMR), 197 compromised the immune systems of some children such that the measles virus present in MMR was able to survive in their bodies, causing autism (the \"Phase 1\" theory); second, that thimerosal -containing vaccines alone caused Marianne Williamson has described mandatory vacci nation as \"draconian\" and \"Orwellian,\" but subsequently apologized for having \"misspoke[n].\" Matt Stieb, Where Does Marianne Williamson Actually Stand on Vaccines? , NEW YORK (Aug. -stand -on-vaccines.html .

Judicial Responses to Legal Challenges to Mandatory Vaccination Policies Mandatory vaccination policies proved controversial from an early stage, and lawsuits challenging vaccination requirements on constitutional and common -law grounds have been a feature of public health law since the nineteenth century.207 The most significant feature of the body of law addressing these claims is that courts \u2014state and federal, regardless of time or place \u2014have uniformly upheld the government's right to impose vaccination requirements in the name of public health, and have generally rejected claims of constitutional or other rights against compliance with such policies, whether grounded in normative or epistemic pluralism. A survey of judicial responses to legal challenges to mandatory vaccination policies over the twentieth century reveals two themes that recur frequently in courts' adjudication of individual rights -based objections to mandatory vaccination policies. The first of th ese is an emphasis, somewhat at odds with the dominant strain of libertarian individualism in American politics,208 on the authority of the state to impose obligations on individuals to achieve some communal benefit. Second, courts almost uniformly defer to legislative or municipal expertise and consistently refuse to entertain challenges to the empirical 1170, 1171 (2012) (concluding that \"nonmedical exemptions have continued to increase, and the rate of increase has accelerated\"); Saad B.

Empirical disagreements are consistently resolved in favor of the state and its designated public health experts; i ndividuals' rejection of those experts' consensus that vaccines are safe and effective at preventing disease is typically regarded by courts as irrational and illegitimate, or at least undeserving of judicial validation. This section will explore both of these themes in the body of judicial decisions addressing challenges to mandatory vaccination policies in the twentieth century, beginning with the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts . 209 While it was neither the first nor the last case to address a constitutional challenge to mandatory vaccination, Jacobson set the tone for the next century of litigation on this issue by articulating a broad view of the state's power to preserve public health through mandatory immunization . The Jacobson case began with a smallpox outbreak in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1902. On February 27 of that year, the city's board of health adopted a resolution requiring all residents \"who have not been successfully vaccinated since March 1st, 1897, to be vaccinat ed or revaccinated.\" 210 The statute delegating authority to the board of health to adopt a vaccination requirement also prescribed a fine of five dollars for refusal to comply.211 One such refusal was by the Reverend Henning Jacobson, a Swedish immigrant and p astor of a Lutheran church in Cambridge.212 Jacobson, who claimed to have suffered a severe illness from a previous vaccination and to have witnessed a similar reaction in his son,213 refused to comply with the vaccination ordinance and was charged with violat ing the applicable statute. At trial, Jacobson made 14 offers of proof, seeking to introduce facts pertaining to the purported lack of safety or effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine generally as well as his and his son's prior adverse reactions to vaccina tion. 214 The trial court rejected each of Jacobson's offers of proof, and Jacobson was convicted and sentenced to pay the $5 fine.215 On appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed Jacobson's conviction and rejected his constitutional challenges the statute empowering the board of health to impose the requirement.216 Jacobson appealed to the Supreme Court, asserting a number of constitutional objections. Most significantly, he claimed that the 209. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). 210. Id. at 13. 211. Id. at 12. 212.

Particularly in light of the historical moment in which it was decided, 218 Jacobson's vision of the state's authority to regulate private behavior for the sake of a public benefit is striking. The decision does not so much deny the existence of a right of \"every freeman\" to bodily autonomy as simply state that any s uch right, if it exists, is subordinate to the right of the community to protect itself against threats to public health . In a jurisprudential era best remembered as hostile to governmental regulation of private conduct, 219 the Court's language in Jacobson is remarkable for its conception of the broad power of the state to impose immunization obligations for the purpose of preserving public health and safety, without regard to the rights -based objections of individual dissenters. 220 The Court presented this sub limation of individual liberty claims to common interest as a practical necessity of governance and a bulwark against anarchy: There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis organized soc iety could not exist with safety to its members. Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disaster and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be 217. Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 26. 218. The Court's decision in Jacobson was issued about two months before its decision in Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 (1905), which invalidated a New York state law limiting the number of hours that bakers were permitted to work. The distribution of votes in Jacobson and Lochner illustrates the tension between the two decisions' visions of the scope of the state police power to enact regulations in furtherance of public health and welfare. Justice Peckham, one of the two dissenters in Jacobson, was the author of the Court's decision in Lochner, in which Justice Brewer, the other Jacobson dissenter, joined. Justices Harlan and Hol mes, both members of the majority in Jacobson, dissented separately in Lochner, each citing Jacobson in support of his argument that Lochner was wrongly decided. 198 U.S. at 75 (Holmes, J., dissenting), 78 (Harlan, J., dissenting). 219.

The Court rejected the petitioner's offers of proof that some medical professionals doubted the safety or efficacy of the smallpox vaccine, observing that \"an opposite theory accords with the common belief, and is maintained by high medical authority.\" 222 Choosing between competing theories of epidemiology, the Court concluded, was a matter for legislative rather than judicial expertise. 223 Jacobson's prioritization of communal welfare over individual rights claims has remained a consistent theme of judicial analyses of mandatory vaccination requirements even as rights -based notions of bodily autonomy and informed consent 224 gained broader influence during the 20th century.225 This theme of judicial deference to legislative expertise on disputed empirical questions concerning the safety or efficacy of vaccinations is nearly universal throughout the body of case law concerning legal challenges to mandatory vaccination policies. 226 Although the petitioner in Jacobson did not present a Free Exercise claim or rely significantly on religious or philosophical objections in support of 221.

City of New York is illustrative of the modern e ra of vaccine litigation.230 In a consolidated action, the plaintiffs challenged the state's statutory and regulatory vaccination requirements on several constitutional grounds \u2014most notably the Free Exercise Clause, the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause. The Second Circuit affirmed the lower court's judgments in favor of the defendants, holding the vaccination requirements constitutional under all theories. The court invoked Jacobson to den y the plaintiffs' substantive due process claim, including, crucially, Jacobson's principle of judicial epistemic deference. Though the plaintiffs argued that \"a 227. See, e.g., Workman v. Mingo County Bd. of Educ ., 419 F. App'x 348 (4th Cir. 2011) (rejecting Free Exercise challenge to immunization requirement for public school attendance); U.S. v. Chadwell, 36 C.M.R. 741 (1965) ( upholding mandatory troop vaccination against religious objections); see also Prince v. United States, 321 U.S. 158, 166 -67 (1957) (\"The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.\"). 228. See, e.g. , Caviezel v. Great Neck Pub. Sch., 500 F. App'x 16 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order) (denying substantive due process challenge to mandatory vaccination requirement). Litigants challenging mandatory immunization requirements have succeeded only in the narrow class of cases in which courts have held that the agency that enacted the challenged provision lacked statutory authority to do so. See Burroughs v. Mortenson, 312 Ill. 163 (1924) (board of education lacked authority to adopt mandatory vaccination requirement); Rhea v. Bd. of Educ. of Devils Lake Sp. Sch.

In addition to the cases cited supra notes 22 6-228, litigation against California's S.B. 277 has been a significant locus of antivaccinationist effort in recent years. The law has been uniformly upheld against state and federal constitutional attack by every court to consider the issue. See Love v. Dep't of Educ., No. C086030, 2018 WL 6382089, at *2 (Cal. Ct.

Legislative Accommodation of Normative Pluralism While courts have resoundingly rejected their claims for exemptions grounded in legal right, antivaccinationists have enjoyed a greater measure of success before state legislatures. Such success, however, has been completely restricted t o objections grounded in normative rather than epistemic pluralism. 234 Antivaccination advocates have had significant success in obtaining exemptions grounded in religious or philosophical objections to immunization. 235 Forty- five states allow religious except ions to mandatory vaccination policies,236 and 15 states allow exceptions for non -religious \"philosophical\" objections.237 No state, however, provides exemptions from mandatory vaccination policies on the grounds of empirical disagreement with the medical or s cientific 231.

Courts have generally upheld statutory religious and philosophical exemptions as constitutional, subject to some caveats. Most notably, several courts have overturned requirements that religious objectors be members of an organized religious group, or that opposition to immunization be a part of the objector's church's official doctrine. 238 In McCarthy v. Boozman ,239 for example, the district court invalidated Arkansas's religious exemption, whi ch allowed exemption only to individuals whose objections were grounded in \"the religious tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination of which the parent . . . is an adherent or member.\" 240 The court held that the statutory religiou s exemption violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment insofar as it \"benefit[ted] only those who are members or adherents of a church or religious denomina tion recognized by the State.\"241 Similarly, courts have ruled that states may, but need not, require that a religious belief be sincerely held in order to qualify for the exemption; where the statute does not impose a sincerity requirement, some courts have held that state authorities may not inquire into the sincerity of the objector's asserted religious belief. 242 238.

Pennsylvania , the Third Circuit held that an employer's vaccination mandate for health care workers did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964's provisions on religious discrimination where the plaintiff's objection was grounded in the belief that \"one should not harm their own body and... that the flu vaccine may do more harm than good.\" 877 F.3d 487, 492 (3d Cir. 2017); see also 2012 WL 4364660, at *8 (E.D.

At least one court, and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, however, have found termination for failure to comply with a workplace vaccination mandate t o raise a triable issue of religious discrimination under Title VII.

Board of Education of New York , for example, the Se cond Circuit affirmed the denial of a religious exemption based on the district court's determination that the parents' \"opposition to immunization is not motivated by religious beliefs, but rather, by plaintiffs' personal fears for their daughters' well -being.\" 244 In so doing, courts have reinforced the normative/epistemic divide in the structure of statutory exemptions and further entrenched the law's tacit commitment to accommodation of objections to generally applicable legal requirements grounded in normative principle and concomitant lack of accommodation to objections grounded in epistemic pluralism. IV. RATIONALIZING THE NORMATIVE /EPISTEMIC DIVIDE IN LAW AND THEORY : TOWARD A PRINCIPLE OF EPISTEMIC PUBLIC REASON If Rawls is correct that the coercive imp osition of comprehensive viewpoints upon reasonable dissenters constitutes a violation of the duty of reciprocity and undermines the democratic legitimacy of state policy , then we may ask wh ether the same problem arise s when the state imposes policies grou nded in the empirical views of the majority. Liberal society is characterized by widespread popular disagreement concerning questions of empirical fact, and epistemic pluralism is driven by the same freedom of conscience and free institutions that Rawls id entified as a source of persistent normative pluralism.245 Rawls's omission of epistemic pluralism is therefore a curious oversight. The state of the law concerning mandatory vaccination places this problem in a concrete context: does empirical disagreement regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccinations challenge the legitimacy of state policies requiring immunization? Can a meaningf ul distinction be drawn between the imposition upon a dissenting citizen of policies grounded in normative commitments that the citizen rejects and the same imposition 243. See, e.g. , Mason v. General Brown Cent. School Dist. 851 F.2d 47 (2d Cir. 1988) (parents' belief that immunization was contrary to \"genetic blueprint\" was not religious belief for purposes of religious exemption); Farina v. Board of Educ. of City of New York, 116 F . Supp. 2d 503 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (religious exemption does not apply to moral, scientific, or philosophical objections); Berg v. Glen Cove City School Dist., 853 F. Supp. 651 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (noting that medical, scientific, or philosophical objections are i nsufficient); In re Christine M., 157 Misc. 2d 4 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1992) (objections grounded in scientific or medical doubt do not qualify for religious exemption). 244. Galinsky v.

Why, in other words, does the state exceed the scope of democratic legitimacy in, for example, forbidding access to abortion because the Christian majority deems it sinful, but not in requiring citizens to expose their children to a medical procedure that they s incerely believe poses unwarranted health risks? This section will develop a principle of epistemic public reason . It will examine both the content of an epistemic overlapping consensus and identify a criterion by which unreasonable epistemic viewpoints \u2014at least those concerning a specific type of empirical question classified as \"scientific\" \u2014can be identified . Rationalizing the distinction between moral and epistemic pluralism on which the vaccination exemption scheme rests requires adapting Rawls's account of public reason to the context of epistemic pluralism . This requires particular attention to Rawls's distinction between reasonable comprehensive views, which collectively comprise the overlapping consensus, and unreasonable views, which exist outside t he overlapping consensus and thus beyond the scope of the duties of reciprocity and civility . 246 Rawls's concept of reasonableness has been criticized as both circular and arbitrary,247 but it has at least the virtue of establishing a line beyond which the exi stence of normative pluralism ceases to present a problem of legitimacy . Under Rawls's theory, the state need not concern itself with the full range of normative pluralism, but only with pluralism among groups whose fundamental moral commitments are compat ible with the state's own. Two aspects of Rawls's criterion of reasonableness are of particular salience . First, it is explicitly constructivist , in that it defines the \"reasonable\" comprehensive view not in terms of moral truth, but rather in terms of its compatibility with the values of the overlapping consensus. 248 Indeed, Rawls maintains that political constructivism does 246. In defending his view that public policies should be grounded in public reason, Rawls concedes that \"[t]hose who reject constitutional democracy... will of course reject the very idea of public reason,\" but quickly dismisses this objection, noting that \"[p]o litical liberalism does not engage those who think this way.\" Rawls, supra note 14, at 574. 247. See, e.g. , Marilyn Friedman, John Rawls and the Political Coercion of Unreasonable People , in THE IDEA OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM : ESSAYS ON RAWLS 16 (Victoria Dav ion & Clark Wolf eds. 1999); Stephen Mulhall & Adam Swift, Rawls and Communitarianism , in THE CAMBRIDGE COMPANION TO RAWLS 483 (Samuel Richard Freeman ed. 1997) (\"By defining 'the reasonable' as including a commitment to a politically liberal vision of soc iety, Rawls defines anyone who queries or rejects that vision as 'unreasonable', but he offers no independent reason for accepting that morally driven and question -begging definition.\"). 248. RAWLS , supra note 7, reason that [a constructivist p olitical conception] may be the focus of an overlapping consensus of comprehensive doctrines is that it develops the principles of justice from public and shared ideas of society as a fair system of cooperation and of citizens as free and equal by using the principles of their common practical reason.\"). 57Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019226 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 not rely on a notion of truth at all.249 We are the tribe of the Liberal Democrats, he argues, and our political values and traditions h ave value not because they are true, but because they are ours. Second, at the same time, Rawls's conception of reasonableness is fundamentally normative ; it is a criterion of demarcation by which to identify which comprehensive viewpoints are morally enti tled to reciprocity and civility. Even if that criterion of demarcation asserts constructivism rather than truth as justification, it nevertheless carries an implicit ought\u2014 as any normative criterion must.250 A viable principle of epistemic reasonableness ca nnot perform an analogous function in the context of epistemic pluralism if excised from its normative component. It must define the reasonable as encompassing a set of epistemological methodologies identified not for their veridical tendencies, but rather by virtue of their compatibility with an overlapping social consensus concerning the construction of cognizable knowledge . It also must account for the fact that the epistemically unreasonable act wrongly \u2014and thus forfeit any claim to reciprocity \u2014in forming their empirical beliefs. Thus, a principle of epistemic public reason must draw upon concepts of virtue epistemology , including the central undertaking of that field to \"extend the range of moral concepts to include the normative dimension of cognitive activity.\" 251 As in the case of normative views, the comprehensive epistemological viewpoints \u2014holistic methodologies for the construction of empirical knowledge\u2014 by which individuals form empirical beliefs can be distinguished from an overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemological views\u2014 the set of epistemic principles that have been recognized as legitimate by broad consensus in liberal societ y. For example, comprehensive epistemological methodologies rely on such sources of empirical knowledge, among others, as local or cultural tradition , religious or other received dogma, faith (in a broader, not 249.

THEORY 45, 53 (1999) (\"[W]hile mathematical constructivism [denies] that there is a mind -independent mathematical reality, political constructivism refuses to affirm or deny a mind- independent moral reality.\"). 250. In distinguishing the overlapping consensus from \"mere\" modus vivendi, Rawls explains that: the object of consensus, the political conception of justice, is itself a moral conception....

These are at times legitimate and even necessary methods of belief formation \u2014knowledge transmitted by folk wisdom or superstition may well contain valuable truths, and ultimately all knowledge must be acquired through personal experi ence of a sort, notwithstanding the substantial limitations on the individual perspective. 252 The epistemological background culture involves competition among comprehensive epistemological views for influence, with different comprehensive methodologies offe ring distinct knowledge- constructive methods. In order to articulate a principle of epistemic public reason, we must first identify a criterion, or set of criteria, by which the overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemic pluralism is defined. Is there an epistemic sine qua non , carrying both normative force and constructivist legitimacy, by which epistemic methodologies that are entitled to reciprocity may be distinguished from those that are not? This is a multifaceted question . As in the case of norma tive pluralism, it is likely that the outer bounds of epistemic reasonableness are to be defined by a combination of epistemic virtues. But with respect to the type of empirical question at issue here \u2014the existence (or not) of regular, observable, measurab le associations between discrete classes of events , which I will refer to as \"scientific\" questions \u2014the reasonableness of an epistemic viewpoint is to be measured by a single overriding criterion: the compatibility of that viewpoint with the methods of sci entific empiricism. While acknowledging that a precise solution to the problem of demarcation distinguishing \"science\" from non -science is a vexing one that is beyond the scope of this Article, we may nevertheless see that the scientific \"method\" \u2014a catch- all term referring broadly to the construction of knowledge via inductive inference from controlled empirical observation, often involving experimentation, repetition, and a system of institutionalized skepticism , conducted against a background assumption o f methodological naturalism 253 has emerged as the dominant process by which scientific knowledge has been constructed.254 252.

This is not to say that empiricism or rationalism have ever enjoyed unrivaled hegemony at any moment in liberal intellectual history; that tradition has been challenged and subverted from within by strains of antirationalist Romanticism.

But just as in the case of those whose comprehensive normative views are incompatible with the commitments of the overlapping consensus, however, \"[p]olitical liberalism does not engage those who think this way.\" 255 Thus we reach the first principle of epistemic reasonableness with respect to scientific questions: [1] An epistemic viewpoint is reasonable if and only if it accepts the privileged status of scientific empiricism in the construction of knowledge concerning scientific questions. An epistemic viewpoint that rejects scientific empiricism is unreasonable in the direct, or first -order, sense. Identifying compatibility with scientific empirici sm as the criterion of reasonableness as to scientific questions does not get us very far . The near- universality of consensus by which scientific empiricism is recognized as the criterion of epistemic reasonableness also means that most disputes about scientific questions at least rhetorically occur within the paradigm of scientific empiricism rather than outside it. This is surely true, at least in large part, in the case of antivaccinationism. While we might characterize , for example, the claim that \"mother's intuition\" is a better method of constructing knowledge concerning complex questions of causal relations between vaccination and health outcomes than peer - reviewed medical research as epistemically unreasonable in the first -order sense , antivaccinationists often adopt at least the rhetorical form of scientific discourse. Thus, to say that recognition of the privileged status of scientific empiricism in the construction of scientific knowledge comprises the fundamental criterion of epistemic r easonableness with respect to scientific questions is simply to raise the further question of who is to decide, in the context of a specific dispute, what the prevailing scientific conclusions on the matter are. 256 As to this second -order question, we are c ompelled to rely on the professional judgment of scientists in the field to identify the scope and contours of expert consensus.257 Scientific laypersons, by definition, lack 255.

David Winickoff, Epistemic Jurisdictions: Science and Courts in R egulatory (De)centralization in KNOWLEDGE , TECHNOLOGY AND LAW, Martyn Pickersgill eds., 2014) (defining \"epistemic jurisdiction\" as \"the power to produce, interpret or warrant technical knowledge for a given political community, topi cal arena, or geographical territory\"). 257. To the extent this deference relies on a notion of truth, it is merely a second -order epistemic authority of a practicing professional in matters concerning the substance of her vocation. The first -order justific ation for scientific empiricism as the criterion of demarcation between reasonable and unreasonable 60University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 229 access to the full body of information on which the expert consensus is based and, as such, lack an epistemically valid basis on which to dispute the content that consensus with members of the epistemic community of experts .258 These observations suggest a measure of the scope of reasonable epistemic pluralism: where the relevant experts l ack a clear consensus on a particular point, the room for reasonable disagreement is comparatively broad , so long as the position is supported by good -faith application of the methods of scientific empiricism . 259 On the other hand, where the relevant experts share a general consensus with respect to an empirical question \u2014whether the age of the Earth is closer to 4 billion or 10 thousand years, for example \u2014that consensus constrains the scope of epistemic reasonableness such that the views of epistemic dissente rs may legitimately be disregarded as unreasonable.260 This leads us to the second principle of epistemic reasonableness with respect to scientific questions: [2] An epistemic viewpoint satisfying principle (1) is reasonable if and only if it accepts knowl edge constructed by scientific empiricism as articulated by the consensus of scientists with epistemic authority in the relevant scientific domain. An epistemic viewpoint that satisfies principle (1) but violates principle (2) is epistemically unreasonable indirectly, or in the second -order. We may observe that principles (1) and (2) reflect the distinction between \"non- science\" and \"pseudoscience,\" respectively. Having defined the principles of epistemic reasonableness, we can now articulate a principle of epistemic public reason analogous to Rawls's epistemic pluralism in matters concerning scientific questions remains the constructivist rationale discussed above. 258. See generally HARRY COLLINS & ROBERT EVANS , RETHINKING EXPERTISE (2007) (calling for a \"third wave\" of science studies to reconcile the deconstructivist insights of postmodern critiques with the existence of genuine epistemic authority); Scott Brewer, Scientific Expert Testimony and In tellectual Due Process , 107 Y ALE L.J. 1535 (1997) (discussing the problem of \"epistemic competence\" in judicial engagement with scientific expertise). 259. This approach is complicated by the fact that, unlike normative viewpoints, empirical views formed v ia the inductive method of scientific empiricism are necessarily probabilistic; thus, the state must respond to the risk of a range of empirical outcomes on the basis of necessarily imperfect and incomplete information. How it does so \u2014the degree of risk -aversion that the state's policymaking apparatus adopts and the probability threshold at which risk is considered actionable\u2014 are political questions with inextricably normative components. I leave the \"mixed\" question of how the state should address pluralis m in risk tolerance to future work, since the relative risks involved in vaccination and the level of certainty around the medical consensus is quite high in comparison to many other politically controversial manifestations of epistemic pluralism. 260. Of course, who the relevant experts are and how much agreement establishes a \"consensus\" are sometimes difficult questions in themselves. See James R. Dillon, Expertise on Trial , 19 COLUM .

Cir. 1923)). 61Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019230 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 principle of normative public reason. The ideal of epistemic public reason is realized whenever citizens and public officials act from and advocate for public policies grounded in what they believe to be the mo st reasonable application of scientific empiricism to scientific questions of public significance .261 In so doing, the principle of reciprocity is respected because all reasonable members of the political community, including dissenters, can accept the epistemic methods by which policy -relevant scientific facts were determined as reasonable, even if they disagree with the ultimate conclusions. But the duty of reciprocity only extends as far as the epistemic overlapping consensus \u2014that is, to persons who accept the principles of epistemic reasonableness. Beyond that point \u2014with respect to agents whose empiric al beliefs on some policy -relevant scientific question were formed by non -scientific or pseudoscientific methods \u2014the state and its officials are under no obligation to provide reasons acceptable to the epistemic outlier. Applying the principle of epistemic public reason, the legitimacy question as applied to mandatory vaccination policies is rather simple given the overwhelming weight of scientific consensus supporting the (relative) safety and efficacy of vaccination. For over two hundred years, medical experts have shared a broad consensus regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination as a preventative intervention. That consensus has grown even stronger in the years following publication of the Wakefield Study, as repeated studies have debunk ed any causal relationship between childhood vaccination and the development of autism. Thus, reasons for mandatory vaccination policies grounded in the established safety and efficacy of vaccination are epistemic public reasons and can be accepted by all epistemically reasonable citizens. This includes epistemically reasonable vaccine skeptics \u2014those who accept the principles of epistemic reasonableness yet nevertheless doubt the specific empirical conclusions on which policies of mandatory vaccination are grounded. 262 Most empirical antivaccinationist arguments are not epistemically reasonable.263 Such arguments have come in two broad forms: claims concerning the superiority of alternative epistemological methods, such as maternal intuition, to discovering empi rical truths about vaccine safety; 261. Cf. Rawls, supra note 14, at 576. 262. Kirkland discusses a small group of epistemically reasonable vaccine skeptics \u2014scientists at mainstream institutions who were proponents of a causal link between mercury exposure and the development of autism, but were unwilling to go beyond the scientific evidence. KIRKLAND , supra note 86 at 186 -87. Such individuals, by definition, can accept the reasons grounded in the scientific consensus even when they disagree with the state's conclusions. 263. Not all antivaccinationist arguments are empirical, though as noted above, professed religious or philosophical objections at least sometimes cover legally unpalatable empirical objections to vaccination. See supra Part II(C)(1). Genuine religious or philosophical objections fall within the realm of normative plur alism and as such are beyond the scope of this Article. 62University of Cincinnati Law Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 231 and arguments purporting to apply the methods of scientific empiricism while rejecting the content of the mainstream scientific consensus . The first form is epistemically unreasonable in the direct or first -order insofar as it rejects the privileged position of scientific empiricism in the construction of scientific knowledge . The second form is epistemically unreasonable indirectly, or in the second -order , insofar as it adheres to the form of scientific empiricism but imp licitly rejects that methodology by rejecting the scientific consensus regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination . It is, in other words, pseudoscientific.264 Thus, empirical objections to vaccination mandates grounded in claims that vaccines are unsaf e or ineffective are epistemically unreasonable, and the state may disregard them in establishing public policy. V. CONCLUSION : EPISTEMIC PUBLIC REASON AS A RATIONALIZING LEGAL PRINCIPLE The aim of this Article has been twofold: first, to focus attention on the distinct sphere of epistemic pluralism as an omission from Rawls's account of \"reasonable\" pluralism; and second, to assess whether the inevitable fact of epistemic pluralism in a liberal society characterized by free institutions creates the same challenges for the legitimacy of the democratic state as does normative pluralism, and if so, whether it is amenable to a solution analogous to that of Rawls's principle of public reason. The examination of legal challenges to mandatory vaccination requir ements provides a useful perspective on these questions for several reasons. First, the question of the safety or efficacy of vaccines is one on which the epistemic battle lines have been, subject to minor variations with the changing times, relatively sta ble for two centuries. During that time, the pro -vaccination side has enjoyed the support of the mainstream medical community as well as the imprimatur of the state in the form of recommended or, frequently, mandatory vaccination requirements. The medical establishment and state authorities have enjoyed almost complete deference from the courts, which have uniformly upheld the imposition of vaccination requirements as a legitimate exercise of states' police power and have rejected any claims to constitution al exemption from vaccination requirements on the grounds of religious freedom or otherwise. Yet the epistemic dissensus has persisted in the face of such opposition, at times attracting a substantial minority of public sentiment and occasionally erupting into civil disobedience or even violent opposition to state -mandated immunization policies. 264. See, e.g., KIRKLAND , supra note 86 at 193 (noting that the petitioners' evidence in the OAP \"came to be seen as scientifically suspect because it did not hold itself out for the kind of scrutiny t hat characterizes the most prestigious science: testing and retesting, transparency, and replication\"). 63Steiner-Dillon: Sticking Points Published by University of Cincinnati College of Law Scholarship and Publications, 2019232 UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW [VOL. 88 My goal in conclusion is to consider the implications of the principle of epistemic public reason on other legal discussions. Perhaps most obviously, epistemic publ ic reason provides a principled basis to distinguish normative from epistemic pluralism in applications of the First Amendment's religion clauses, either in lawsuits seeking accommodations for religious belief under the Free Exercise Clause or those challe nging some state policy under the Establishment Clause. It could, for example, serve to rationalize the holdings in Epperson v. Arkansas , 265 Edwards v. Aguillard ,266 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District ,267 and similar cases in which the courts have invalidated statutes prohibiting the teaching of biological evolution via natural selection in public classrooms or requiring or permitting teaching the theory of creationism/\"intelligent design\" 268 alongside evolu tion. Similar to Stephen Jay Gould's concept of \"non- overlapping magisteria,\"269 the principle of epistemic public reason would support a constitutional principle of deference to scientific expertise on empirical matters such as the evolution of life and the age of Earth; in such matters, demands of religious objectors to accommodation in the name of pluralism would be unjustified and therefore could legitimately be denied without violating the principle of religious tolerance. At the same time, matters perta ining to normative rather than epistemic pluralism \u2014for example, whether religious institutions must comply with state anti -discrimination laws in hiring support staff 270\u2014might be subjected to a \"reasonableness\" test under the Free Exercise Clause to determine whether such principles are broadly consistent with the fundamental normative commitments of the 265. 393 U.S. 97 (1968). 266. 482 U.S. 578 (1987). 267. 400 F. Supp. 2d 707 (M.D. Pa. 2005). 268.

STEPHEN JAY GOULD , ROCKS OF AGES: SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN THE FULLNESS OF LIFE 65 (1999). Gould's conceptual framework has been criticized for its failure to acknowledge that religious claims often include empirical assertions; creationism is a classic example of a religious claim with a predominantly empirical component. The principle of epistemi c public reason avoids that criticism by distinguishing between propositions that are primarily normative and those that are primarily empirical, regardless of whether the proposition can be classified as \"religious.\" 270.

The Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. H obby Lobby Stores, Inc.271 illustrates the doctrinal confusion introduced by the failure to recognize the distinction between normative and epistemic public reason . In that case, the Court held that closely held for -profit corporations may be entitled to an exemption under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993272 from compliance with the regulations promulgated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010273 that would require them to provide their employees with health insurance covering access to \"abortifacient\" technologies where the provision of such technologies violated the corporations' religious objections to abortion.274 The technologies to which the respondents objected included \"two forms of emergency contraception commonly called 'morning after' pills and two forms of intrauterine devices [IUDs].\"275 The Court stated that these technologies \"may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus,\"276 and becaus e the Hobby Lobby respondents held a \"sincere Christian belief that life begins at conception,\" they deemed this prevention of implantation to be a form of abortion.277 In fact, however, this account of the technologies' function departs in two ways from the mainstream medical community's current understanding. First, the medical community defines pregnancy as commencing with the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, not the moment of fertilization. 278 Even if the technologies at issue operate to prev ent the implantation of a fertilized egg as the Hobby Lobby respondents believed, they still would not terminate a \"pregnancy\" and thus would be properly labeled contraceptives rather than abortifacients. Second, and more fundamentally, the Court's (and Hobby Lobby's) account of how the contraceptive devices at issue function is likely factually incorrect.

The Hobby Lobby majority's opinion glossed over the respondents' factual errors by characterizing their objection a s a \"religious\" one and thus entitled to accommodation under RFRA. The Court wrote that \"[t]he [respondents] believe that providing the coverage demanded by the HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is sufficient to mak e it immoral for them to provide the coverage,\" and criticized the HHS and the principal dissent for purporting to tell the respondents that their beliefs concerning this \"religious and philosophical question . . . are flawed.\" 280 By conflating the epistem ic issues with the normative one, the Court in Hobby Lobby ignored the distinction between normative and epistemic pluralism. By the Court's logic, antivaccinationists' opposition to mandatory vaccination policies could easily be recast as a \"religious\" objection to injecting children with a substance that \"may\" cause autism. Should the mainstream medical community respond that the best available evidence strongly indicates that vaccines do not cause autism, the Hobby Lobby Court would contend that \"the fe deral courts have no business addressing whether the religious belief asserted in a RFRA case 279.

The law, for the most part, has maintained that distinction in most contexts, including in response to legal challenges to mandatory vaccination policies; the Hobby Lobby Court's failure to do so highlights the need for a more explicit articulation of the distinct criteria by which the principles of normative and epistemic public reason define reasonableness. In sum, an examination of epistemic pluralism from a Rawlsian perspective reveals a glaring omission from Rawls's account of \"reasonable\" pluralism, an omission that suggests an overlooked challenge to the legitimacy of state policymaking. This Article represents a first effort at defining a principle of epistemic publ ic reason that acknowledges entrenched disagreement around matters of empirical fact arising from the burdens of empirical judgment and operation of free institutions in a liberal society , and attempts to resolve legitimacy concerns arising from the state' s imposition of policies grounded in contested empirical views by defining the scope of an overlapping consensus of reasonable epistemic views. The principle of epistemic public reason articulated herein no doubt will require further elaboration and refine ment, but in this era of \"fake news\" and fraying public trust in the epistemic authority of gatekeeping institutions such as the mainstream press and the scientific establishment, it is essential to address more clearly the problem of state policymaking in a society characterized by deepening rifts in our shared conception of reality . VI. POST SCRIPT : A NOTE OF CAUTION This is an Article about law, and thus about violence and coercion.282 My thesis has been that the phenomenon of epistemic pluralism \u2014 entrenche d disagreement about matters of empirical fact \u2014poses similar problems of legitimacy under a Rawlsian analysis as does the phenomenon of normative pluralism, and that the principle of epistemic public reason defines the distinction between reasonable and unreasonable epistemic viewpoints. Empirical antivaccinationist arguments are epistemically unreasonable; thus, the state is free to apply the coercive force of law to impose vaccination policies grounded in the consensus of mainstream medical science. In th e case of vaccine refusal, 281. Id. (parentheses omitted). 282. See Robert M.

Antivaccinationists expose their own children, the children of others, and the community at large to serious risks of vaccine -preventable disease. Centuries of experience with vaccination have shown the procedure to be an extraordinarily effective means of controlling the spread of disease, and the medical community has long since resolved any reasonable doubts concerning vaccines' safety relative to the medical benefits the procedure creates. The benefits of imposing a vaccination requirement with only a narrow medical exception would thus appear to easily outweigh the harm of compelling parents against their will to submit their children to a beneficial medical procedure. Nevertheless , I end on a note of caution. Before advocating a policy of legal coercion \u2014however legitimate that policy may be from Rawls's rather abstract perspective \u2014it is wise to consider the practical effects of that policy. Who, demographically speaking, are the unvaccinated, and what consequences might a more rigid immunization policy produce? Empirical studies show a division between the \"non- vaccinated,\" whose mothers reject vaccination entirely on ideological grounds, and the \"under- vaccinated,\" who have receiv ed some but not all recommended immunizations. 283 Under -vaccinated children are more likely to be African American, to live in a central city, and to have a mother who is young, unmarried, lacks a college degree, and has an annual household income at or near the poverty line. 284 In contrast, mothers of the non - vaccinated are more likely to be white, married, college -educated, and with an annual household income over $75,000.285 Under -vaccination is, at least to a considerable degree, a problem of inaccessible hea lth care infrastructure rather than ideological opposition.286 The affluent non -vaccinated\u2014 the true antivaccinationists \u2014are motivated by a different set of concerns. Jennifer Reich's study of mostly white, affluent mothers who reject the recommended vaccina tion schedule found three broad areas of shared belief: (1) that the mothers themselves are more capable of assessing the risks and benefits of 283.

DAILY NEWS - kindergartens- are-under -vaccinated. 68University of Cincinnati Review, Vol. 88, Iss. 1 [2019], Art. 5 https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol88/iss1/52019] STICKING POINTS 237 vaccines than experts such as medical professionals and state agencies;287 (2) that alternative resource - and time -intensive mothering practices, particularly involving breastfeeding and \"organic\" diets, will maintain their children's health without the need for vaccination;288 and (3) that risk of infection can be effectively managed through what Reich calls \"imagined gated communities\" \u2014careful and active management of their children's social networks to exclude perceived vectors of disease. 289 One might readily expect, then, that these mothers \u2014ideologically opposed to vaccination and with abundant time and resources to i nvest in the pursuit of what they believe to be the best interests of their children \u2014will find more effective means of evasion than the mothers of under -vaccinated children on whom the burden of punitive enforcement would fall most heavily. 290 This post- script should not be read as advocating against narrowing the scope of vaccination exemptions, or in favor of accommodation of epistemic outliers when public health is at stake. My purpose here is simply to point out that the abstract question of legitimacy in the Rawlsian sense does not fully exhaust the question of whether legal coercion in a particular context is advisable, wise, or even intuitively \"fair.\" It is also to remind us of the unintended consequences that can arise in the familiar gap between \"law on the books\" and \"law in action.\" 291 Where a coercive vaccination policy is justified on the basis of the health benefits accruing to the entire community from a vaccination rate sufficient to establish herd immunity, it is imperative that we ensure compli ance not only with the threat of punitive sanctions, but also by providing resources sufficient to enable meaningful access. As vaccination is a matter of communal health, it is essential that the community take the necessary steps to ensure that all membe rs may avail themselves of its benefits. 287. This belief resembles the \"mommy instinct\" to which Jenny McCarthy refers in defense of her own antivaccinationism.

Reich notes that the affluent mothers of her study sample \"feel entitled to address experts as consultants and refuse their advice without fear of reprisal, choices less readily available to less privileged families, whose rejection of expert advice more easily resul ts in state intervention.\" Reich, supra note 165, at 12. The current vaccination regime is, of course, neither the first nor the most brutal in its application of coercive force to achieve compliance, particularly against the underprivileged. See Willrich, supra note 116 , at 77 (during smallpox outbreaks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, \"the vaccinator's lancet and the policeman's club were fast friends\"). 291.
