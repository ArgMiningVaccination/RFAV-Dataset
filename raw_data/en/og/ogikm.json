The role of TCM in intervening in AIDS immune reconstruction, improving the symptoms of HIV/AIDS patients, improving the quality of life of patients, a nd alleviating the suffering of patients were thoroughly analyzed. Specifically, this paper uses a retrospective analysis method to divide 187 AIDS patients into a simple western medicine group and a combined Chinese and western medicine group according to whether the treatment plan is combined with TCM. The medical records of the patients in the included group were classified and analyzed based on the follow -up points before treatment, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment, to observe the change in total symptom score, CD4+ lymphocyte count, and the Karnofsky score. The results demonstrate that the total symptom scores in the western medicine group after treatment were lower than those before treatment, and the decrease in the 12th and 24th months was statistically significant compared with that before treatment (P < 0.05), while the decrease in the 36th month was lower than that before treatment with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Compared with those before treatment, the total symptom scores in the combined group were significantly lower at each follow -up po int (P value < 0.05), and the decrease at the 24th and 36th months was more significant than that in the western medicine group at the same period (P < 0.05). In addition, the CD4+ counts at each follow -up point in the two groups were signifi- cantly increas ed compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05), and the increase in the combined group at the 36th month was significantly more significant than that in the western medicine group at the same period (P < 0.05). Moreover, the Karnofsky score of the west ern medicine group decreased compared with those before treatment except for the 12th month, and there was no significant difference at each time point (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the scores for the combined group increased after treatment compared with before treatment. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05) except for the 12th month, and the differ- ence presented in the 24th and 36th months, contrasting with the western medicine group at the same period, were significant Statistically significant (P < 0.05). We concluded that: 1. Western medicine treatment and combined treatment of traditional Chinese and West- ern medicine can improve the symptoms score of patients, promote the growth of CD4+ lymphocytes, and mediate immune reconstruct ion. The long -term curative effect of combining traditional Chinese and western medicine is more effective, durable and stable. 2. Combined use of traditional Chinese and Western medicine effectively relieves patients' pain and improves their quality of li fe. 3. Long -term application of traditional Chinese medicine combined with HARRT has an effectively synergistic effect and promotes the treatment of AIDS patients. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1. Definition of Immune Reconstitution Immune reconstitution is a non -specific immunotherapy that restores the body's immune function and reverses im- mune damage through various means, thereby reducing the harm of the virus to the human immune system [1]. Successful HIV immunity reconstitution u sually means a steady rise in CD4+ counts to normal levels, improvement in clinical symptoms, and no apparent associated oppor- tunistic infections and tumour formation (Abrams, Levy, Losso MH &et al, 2009). Carter et al. (2010) concluded that immune reconst itution is mainly through improving bone marrow hematopoietic function and increasing BIO Web of Conferences 60, 02022 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20236002022 BFS 2022 \u00a9 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Another scholar found that maintaining T cell homeostasis and promoting T cell proliferation has an essential impact on immune re- consti tution. HARRT is currently the primary method to treat AIDS, promote immunity reconstruction, improve immune function, and reduce mortality. Studies have con- firmed that it can reduce immune damage and block virus proliferation to the greatest extent in any period of AIDS. The current recommendation is to perform HARRT as soon as HIV infection is diagnosed so that the virus can be intervened at an early stage, reduce the risk of transmis- sion, and improve the health of the body. 1.2. Research on New Strategies for Immune Re- constitution 1.2.1 .Bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow transplantation is a type of organ transplan- tation mainly used for diseases of the blood system and immune systems. It is a therapeutic method of transplant- ing diseased bone marrow with health bone marrow (Thaker & Snow 2003). A case was reported that by trans- planting the bone marrow containing the mutant gene CCR5 32, one HIV -positive patient with leukemia was successfully treated, and there was no recurrence after five years of treat ment. The reason may be that CCR5 -deficient cells can resist HIV and promote the clearance of the virus, and bone marrow transplantation is expected to be a new way to cure AIDS. However, many scholars believe that CCR5 deficiency will affect the body's im mune function, cause cancer cells, and increase the prevalence of other HIV strains. At present, standardized cultivation and qual- ity control methods have not been introduced, and there is also a lack of extensive sample studies to confirm its mechanism of action, safety and efficacy. 1.2.2 .Thymus transplantation As an immune organ of the body, the thymus's output function has always been closely related to immune recon- struction. Studies have found that the thymus can export and synthesize T cells, promote T cell growth, and inacti- vate and inhibit HIV [10]. At the same time, the interleu- kin-7 (interleukin -7, IL -7) produced by it can regulate im- munity and maintain T cell proliferation and homeostasis. Many scholars have carried out a series of related studie s on the reconstruction of the immune function of HIV pa- tients through thymus transplantation. However, problems such as the shortage of available organs and immune re- jection still need to be solved urgently (Autran, Carcelain, Li & et al., 1997). 1.2.3.Cy tokine therapy Studies have confirmed that cytokines can regulate the function and survival of cells and improve the body's im- mune response. The use of cytokines as adjuvants in treat- ing AIDS has become a research hotspot. Combining cy- tokines as supplement ary therapy with HAART seems to maximize drug utilization. If some studies have found that IL-7 can increase the count of CD4+ T cells, play an anti- viral and activate the Immune effect, IL -2 can promote the proliferation of naive lymphocytes and improve th e im- mune environment; IL -15 has the function of promoting adaptive immunity. However, some studies have also re- ported no significant difference in the mortality and infec- tion rates between the combined subcutaneous injection of antiviral ther Adoptive immunotherapy extracts the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of uninfected identical twins, trans- forms and proliferates them in vitro, and then injects them into the infected person, thereby helping the infected per- son to increase the differentiation of immune cells, resist viral infection, and achieve the purpose of immune repair. It is helpful for immune reconstruction. However, due to the considerable limitatio ns of its clinical application ob- jects, the curative effect is not yet apparent, and there is still some room for widespread application. In addition, various interventions such as reducing immune activation, AIDS vaccine, hormone therapy, organo -germanium pol- ysaccharide, and gene editing also need further research and development (DANIYAL, AKRAM, HAMID &et al., 2016) 1.3. Limitations of HARRT - Mediated Immune Re- constitution As a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease, AIDS has been raging worldwide for over a few decades, and now it has been gradually controlled under antiretroviral treatment. The practice has proved that HARRT, as a mainstream treatment program, has played an irreplacea- ble role in curbing the AIDS epidemic. However, it has certain limi tations in the mediation of AIDS immune re- constitution. Some patients have minimal recovery of T lymphocyte levels after antiviral treatment or cannot re- turn to normal, showing immune non -response phenom- ena and being unable to obtain good immune reconstruc- tion ( Kolte, Ryder, Albrecht -Beste & et al., 2009) . The specific manifestations are as follows: 1. The virus cannot be eliminated, as only virus replication can be inhibited. The HIV reservoir can hide the virus for a long time or undergo structural mutati ons, and it is easy to wait for the opportunity to rebound; 2. The lack of targeted and indi- vidualized mediation of patients' immune reconstruction leads to differences in treatment effects. At the same time, the effect is unsuitable for some patients with low baseline levels, weak constitution, complex past medical history, severe disease or co -infection; 3. The effect of single -use is average, and long -term use is required, with high patient medication compliance requirements. Long -term use of antiviral d rugs can easily lead to increased drug resistance and a series of adverse reactions, thus affecting treatment. 2BIO Web of Conferences 60, 02022 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20236002022 BFS 2022 1.4. Understanding of TCM Scholars on AIDS Im- mune Reconstruction Under the circumstance that AIDS is sweeping the world, China has actively applied and developed antiviral therapy and vigorously promoted traditional medicine to adapt to the development of the times, which has played a good role in preventing AIDS. In re cent years, through continu- ous development and in -depth discussions (Kwarteng, Ahuno &Kwakye - Nuako, 2017), many studies have con- firmed that traditional Chinese medicine is effective in killing infected immune cells, inhibiting and blocking vi- rus replicati on, improving immunity, and reducing ad- verse reactions. It has significant application value in the prevention and treatment of AIDS. Jiang Feng et al. ob- served 91 AIDS patients, 41 cases in the Chinese and Western medicine group: Shenling Fuzheng Capsule + HARRT and 50 cases in the Western medicine group: HARRT. After six months of treatment, they found that: Shenling Fuzheng Capsule combined with HAART can increase patient's CD4+T count can re- duce the CD8+T count simultaneously and, to a cer tain ex- tent, increase the CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD127+, thereby protecting and improving the body's immune function. Deng Lianbo et al. confirmed that honeysuckle, myrobalan and melon peel could be targeted to resist HIV and inhibit viral activity, and wolfbe rry can promote im- munity. He Gang et al. found that Astragalus can increase the synergistic effect of HARRT therapy and shorten the course of poor immune reconstitution. Yang Guohong et al. found that Shenling Baizhu Powder has a good curative effect on AI DS-related diarrhea patients. Sun used trip- terygium glycosides tablets combined with HAART to treat patients with poor immune reconstitution, and the re- sults showed that the CD4+ count in the peripheral blood of the patients increased, and the level of T c ell activation subsets decreased ( trip- terygium glycosides tablets in improving immune recon- stitution. He Zhengzheng et al. found that Fuzheng Kangd u Pills can improve the clinical symptoms of HIV/HBV co-infected patients, protect CD4+ lymphocytes, and maintain the stability of liver function in patients. As the first Chinese patent medicine approved for AIDS treat- ment in China, Tangcao Pian has been effectively con- firmed i n terms of anti -oxidation, immune regulation, and symptom improvement, and it has good safety ( Sabbatini, Bandera, Ferrario &et al., 2010) . 2 EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH 2.1 Experiment Design According to the inclusion criteria, 148 patients were ex- cluded, five died, 175 patients with data defects, and 157 patients with less than 36 months of treatment. Finally, in- clusion criteria were selected. 187 HIV/AIDS patients. According to whether the treatment was combined with traditional Chinese medicine, the patients were divided into the Western medicine group and the combined Chi- nese and western medicine group. Among them were 71 cases in the Western group and 116 in the combined group. Western medicine group (n=71): conventional HARRT first -line treatment regimen, the main drugs Western medicine group (n=116): Based on the above scheme, according to the patient's symptoms, tongue and pulse, etc., TCM synd rome differentiation treatment was carried out.

Karnofsky score: refer to the evaluation standard of Karnofsky score. Immune index: absolute count of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. This paper uses SPSS 23.0 statistical software for analysis. Measurement data were described by the mean p lus or mi- nus standard deviation, and a t -test was used when they were in line with normal distribution and had equal vari- ances. Test level a = 0.05, P < 0.05 indicates statistical sig- nificance. 2.2 Results Total symptom scores in the Western medicine group de- creased at each time point. Among them, the 12th and 24th months have differences statistically significant compared with before treatment (P < 0.05), and the decrease in the 36th month was not statistically significant compared with that before treatme nt (P > 0.05). Compared with those be- fore treatment, the symptom score in the combined group was significantly lower at each time point (P < 0.05), and the decrease in the 24th and 36th months was significantly better than that in the western medicine grou p at the same period (P < 0.05), Category Number of exam- ples (n) 0 month 0-12 group before treatment, *P0.05; compared with the same period in the Western medical group, #P0.05 CD4+ counts in the Western medicine group and the Com- bined Chin ese and western medicine groups were signifi- cantly increased compared with those before treatment ( P < 0.05 ), and the difference in the Combined Chinese and western medicine group was significantly bigger than that 3BIO Web of Conferences 60, 02022 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20236002022 BFS 2022in the Western medicine group at the sa me period (P < 0.05) at the 36th month.

In recent years, modern and traditional medicine has under- gone countless scientific research on AIDS, all of which have achieved specific curative effects. As an immunode- ficiency disease, the recovery and r econstruction of im- mune function are crucial for disease progression and pa- tient prognosis, and successful immune reconstruction is a hallmark of good clinical benefit. In order to determine the efficacy of AIDS immune reconstitution, modern medi- cine gener ally uses the recovery of CD4+ cell function and the increase in the number as the main signs. Traditional medicine adheres to the concept of treatment based on syn- drome differentiation and the holistic concept and believes that the treatment of AIDS must be combined with the knowledge and understanding of modern medicine. Dif- ferent syndromes and treatment methods should be estab- lished according to the cl inical stage of the patient and the difference in disease location, disease nature, and disease severity. The evaluation of the efficacy of immune recon- struction should not be limited to the increase and decrease of CD4+ counts. Instead, we should adhere t o a compre- hensive analysis, grasp the overall changes in the condi- tion, and focus on different aspects at different times. The subjective feeling and objective signs of HIV/ AIDS pa- tients are specific reflections of the development of the disease. They are essential factors for evaluating whether the immune reconstitution is successfully established. As a reflection index of quality of life, Karnofsky score is also of great significance in evaluating the efficacy of immune reconstruction. The efficacy of tr aditional Chinese medi- cine intervention on immune reconstitution is generally evaluated by comprehensive analysis of CD4+ lympho- cyte count, total symptoms score, and Karnofsky score. 3 CONCLUSION AIDS is an immunodeficiency disease, and the success of immu ne function reconstruction is related to disease pro- gression, prognosis and outcome. As the current main- stream treatment plan, HARRT has limitations such as the inability to remove the virus, low utilization rate of some drugs, prone to complications, and side effects, which can easily affect the treatment effect or cause treatment inter- ruption. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine has been baptized for thousands of years and has played an indelible role in fighting against diseases and protectin g people's health. In recent years, it has been widely used in AIDS treatment, and its clinical efficacy has also been ver- ified. However, neither modern nor traditional medicine has been able to treat AIDS comprehensively. Therefore, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine is an inevitable direction and focuses on breaking through the bottleneck of treatment, improving the curative effect, en- riching the treatment methods, and finding new treatment strategies. In this study, 187 HIV/AIDS patients were retrospec- tively analyzed, and the changes in immune indicators, symptom scores and life quality of patients were analyzed. After comparing the single use of Western medicine and the combined treatment of traditional Chinese and West- ern medicine, it i s found that the latter has significantly better effects in improving symptoms, enhancing immune function, and maintaining long -term curative effects. It can accelerate and maintain the growth of immunological indicators, reduce symptoms and signs, improve the qual- ity of life, and promote the recovery and reconstruction of immune function. For the treatment of AIDS, combining 4BIO Web of Conferences 60, 02022 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20236002022 BFS 2022 traditional Chinese and Western medicine to synergisti- cally enhance the efficacy, improve the success rate of im- mune reconstruction, and alleviate the limitations of the long-term application of HARRT therapy is a desirable ap- proach to AIDS treatment. In the future of AIDS immune reconstruction, we can speed up the process of the preven- tion and treatment model of combined traditional Ch inese and Western medicine. We should combine the ad- vantages of the two and take syndrome differentiation and treatment as the guiding principle. The characteristics and stages of development, different situations, and various as- pects of the patient's cond itions are targeted for special treatment. Especially for patients with a longer course of the disease, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can give full play to its advantages, which is of great benefit for patients to maintain lon g-term and effective immune reconstruction, improve their health, and avoid the limitations and deficiencies of HARRT.
