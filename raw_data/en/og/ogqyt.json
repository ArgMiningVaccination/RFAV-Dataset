The Board shall supply each applicant for admission to the preceptorship program with a list of practitioners who are clinical observers approved by the Board. 5.17Professional liability (malpractice) insurance for preceptorship participants shall be carried by the candidates for licensure.

DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIVISION OF PROFESSIONAL REGULATION BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY Statutory Authority: 24 Delaware Code, Section 105(1) (24 Del.C. \u00a7105(1)) Order Adopting Rules and Regulations AND NOW, this 26th day of April, 2000, in accordance with 29 Del.C. \u00a710118 and for the reasons stated hereinafter, the Board of Accountancy of the State of Delaware(hereinafter \"the Board\") enters this Order adopting Rulesand Regulations. Nature of the Proceedings Pursuant to its authority under 24 Del. C. \u00a7105(1) the Board proposed to adopt new Rules and Regulations toreplace its existing Rules and Regulations. Substantivechanges to the rules and regulations included changes indefinitions of full and part time employment as it relates tothe statutory experience requirement; deletion of provisionspertaining to matters governed by other acts and statutes(e.g. disciplinary hearings); establishing applicationrequirements; requiring demonstration of good c haracter and education requirements prior to approval to sit forexamination; clarification of statutory requirements andrequired documentation for permits to practice certifiedpublic accountancy and for certificate reciprocity;establishing reporting requirements and clarification ofsubstantive requirements for continuing education credits;and procedural rules pertaining to hearings before the Board.In addition, material which unnecessarily duplicated thestatutes or other rules and regulations was stricken. All ofthe rules and regulations were entirely re-ordered and re-numbered. Notice of the public hearing on the Board's proposed rule adoption was published in the Delaware Register of Regulations on January 1, 2000 and in two Delaware newspapers of general circulation, all in accordance with 29Del. C. \u00a710115. The public hearing was held as noticed on February 23, 2000. Following public comment at theFebruary 23, 2000 hearing, the Board deliberated upon theproposed regulations and voted to adopt them in theirentirety, with the exception of Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2,regarding the experience affidavit, to which amendmentswere proposed. Notice of a second public hearing on the proposed amendments to Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 was published in theDelaware Register of Regulations on March 1, 2000 and in two Delaware newspapers of general circulation, inaccordance with 29 Del. C. \u00a710115. The second public hearing was held as noticed on April 26, 2000. Noadditional public comment, oral or written, was received atthe April 26, 2000 hearing. This is the Board's Decision andOrder ADOPTING the rule amendments as proposed,subject to the revisions to Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 publi shed in the March 1, 2000 Register.FINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001669 Evidence and Information Submitted at Public Hearing The Board received two written comments at the February 23, 2000 public hearing in r esponse to the notice of intention to adopt the proposed rule amendments. Carol Ellis , Director of the Division of Professional Regulation, submitted a written comment suggestingchanges to Rule 6.4.1 to broaden the range of experienceallowed for permit applicants who have worked in industryand commerce, suggesting that the Board use certainlanguage found in the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). Ezra Smith, P.A. , a member of the Board of Accountancy, submitted a written comment opposing Rules6.5.1 and 6.5.2 on the basis that they impose additionalexperience requirements on persons previously practicing aslicensed public accountants, beyond the language of 24Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7108(c)(2)(a)(b)and (c) as it pertains to the practice of public accountancy. The Board received oral comments from the public at the February 23, 2000 public hearing as follows: Tom Grabowski, CPA , stated his disagreement with Ms. Ellis' written comments regarding broadening the types ofexperience allowed for those in industry and commerce. Hestated that the banking industry was seeking very broadbased requirements. He pointed out that the problem withallowing broad based experience requirements is that thepublic thinks all CPA's have the same experience andqualifications. There is an expectation that CPA can docertain things, such as preparing financial statements, so theexperience requirement in that area is necessary. Mr.Grabowski stated that he approved of the language of 6.4.1as it is written in the proposed regulations. David Doane, CPA , explained that the UAA is a unified document. While it provides for broader experience, it alsooffsets this by requiring more/different types of education,peer review and other checks on qualifications. In responseto Ms. Ellis' suggestion, Mr. Doane expressed concern that,under broad based experience requirements, a candidatecould, for example, work only for a bank and get banking butnot financial statement experience, get a CPA permit, thenleave the bank and go out into the public with a permit topractice that says he or she is able to do financial statementsand audits-areas in which the CPA has no experience. Mr.Doane believes that experience which is substantiallyequivalent to CPA firm experience can be obtained inbanking and industry. Mr. Doane stated that he approved ofthe language of 6.4.1 as it is written in the proposedregulations, and believes it provides public protection. Mr. Doane also suggested that Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 should be mirror images. The Board should require the sametype of experience affidavit for applicants from both CPAfirms and government and industry. Dana Rubenstein, Executive Director, Delaware Society of CPA's , stated that the yardstick for the experiencerequirements of \u00a7108(c)(2) is the type of experience that would be gained in a CPA firm, and that \"substantiallyequivalent\" experience can be gained from otheremployment. Ms. Rubenstein believes that the experiencelanguage suggested in Ms. Ellis' draft is broader than whatthe law allows and is not \"substantially equivalent\" to CPAexperience. Ezra Smith, P.A., a member of the Board of Accountancy , also made oral comments on the same subject as his written comments, discussed above. Mr. Smithbelieves that 24 Del.C. \u00a7108(c)(2) only provides that a public accountant must have twice the years of experience asother permit applicants, not specific types of experience. Hewould recommend striking Rule 6.5.1 Findings of Fact and Conclusions As outlined in the preceding section, the public was given the required notice of the Board's intention tocomprehensively revise its regulations and was offered anadequate opportunity to provide the Board with commentson the proposed changes. The Board has carefullyconsidered the comments received from the public inreaching the following findings of fact and conclusions.February 23, 2000 hearing: The Board concludes that its consideration of the proposed revisions to its Rules and Regulations is within theBoard's general authority to promulgate regulations under24 Del.C. \u00a7105. Having received no public comment on Rules 1.0 through 5.0 and 7.0 through 13.0, and finding thatthese are necessary for the enforcement of 24 Del.C. chapter 1, and for the full and effective performance of the Board'sduties under that chapter, the Board unanimously voted toadopt these rules. The Board deliberated at length on issues raised by the public pertaining to the Rule 6.0 experience requirements.The Board concluded that it could not accept the languagefor Rule 6.4.1 proposed by Ms. Ellis, finding that the UAAcannot be adopted piecemeal, and that the proposedlanguage is too broad to ensure that all applicants havesufficent experience to do CPA work. The Board agreedwith the majority of the public comments that supported6.4.1 as written. The Board discussed the public comments regarding the inconsistency in 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 as to what proof ofexperience is required for applicants. The Board believesthis is a valid comment and that the sections should mirroreach other. The Board suggested changing the language of6.3.2 by striking the provision requiring a statement of theamount of time devoted to each practice area. The Boardsuggests holding government and industry applicants tosame standard as CPA firm applicants. Therefore, the Boardproposed delet ing 6.4.2 as originally written and substituting the same (amended) language of 6.3.2 as the new 6.4.2. TheFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001670 Board deemed this to be a substantive change and voted to republish the changes and hold a second public hearing onamended rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 pursuant to the AdministrativeProcedures Act. Following the February 23, 2000 hearing, the Board additionally considered Mr. Smith's written and oralcomments regarding the experience required of publicaccountants applying for CPA permits. Mr. Smith stated hisbelief that the legislature intended the doubling of time ofexperience required for public accountants (in \u00a7108(c)(2)) asa substitute for the type (CPA firm and/or financialstatement) experience required of other applicants. Amajority of the board disagreed with this reasoning. Amajority of the Board finds that all CPA's with permits topractice have the exclusive right to issue financial statementsand that the experience requirement the Board has proposedensures that they are competent to do so. Professionalstandards and rights to practice must be the same for allCPA's. The Board finds that it would do the public adisservice to have different CPA's held to different s tandards of experience in obtaining licensure. As to Rule 6.0, Mr. Smith made a motion to strike proposed Rule 6.5.1 as written and adopt language similar tothat proposed by Ms. Ellis. The motion failed for lack of asecond. The Board then entertained a motion to adopt proposed Rule 6.0 as written, with the exception of Rules 6.3.2 and6.4.2, to which amendments, as outlined above, wereproposed. The Board voted 7-1 in favor of this motion, with Mr. Smith dissenting. April 26, 2000 hearing: Following due notice to the public, and publication in the March 1, 2000 Delaware Register of Regulations , a second public hearing was held as noticed on proposedamendments to Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2. No additional publiccomment, oral or written, was received at the April 26, 2000hearing. The Board deliberated on the proposedamendments to Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2, again consideringpublic comment received on these rules in February. TheBoard finds that the proposed amended Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2are necessary for the enforcement of 24 Del.C. chapter 1, and for the full and effective performance of the Board'sduties under that chapter. The Board unanimously voted toadopt Rules 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 as published in the March 1,2000 Register. Order NOW, THEREFORE, by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Accountancy, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 1. The proposed Rules and Regulations are approved and adopted in their entirety, in the exact text attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\".

Nature of the Proceedings Pursuant to its authority under 24 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a73906(1) and (7), the Board proposes to adopt changes and additions to itsexisting Rules and Regulations, relating to continuingeducation requirements for licensees and ethics. Notice ofthe public hearing on the Board's proposed rule amendmentswas published in the Delaware Register of Regulations on March 1, 2000 and in two Delaware newspapers of generalcirculation, all in accordance with 29 Del.C. \u00a710115. The public hearing was held as noticed on April 17, 2000. TheBoard deliberated and voted on the proposed rule amendments following the public hearing at the April 17,2000 meeting, voting unanimously to adopt the ruleamendments. This is the Board's Decision and OrderADOPTING the rule amendments as proposed. Evidence and Information Submitted at Public Hearing The Board received no written comments in response to the notice of intention to adopt the proposed ruleamendments. The Board received oral comments from thepublic at the April 17, 2000 public hearing as follows: Dr. Maria M. Carroll of the Delaware State University Department of Social Work, stated that she was pleased withthe proposed revisions and found them to be thorough andworkable. However, Dr. Carroll expressed concern with theprovision in Rule 7.4.1 that the signed informed consentdocument required when a client is treated by a supervisedintern or student contain the name and telephone number ofthe supervising licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). Dr.Carroll stated that interns and student in other professionsare not required to have their clients sign such a documentand that this might imply that social work students are lesscompetent than others. Hospitals also already have a basicinformed consent document that patients sign which statesthat treatment may be given by interns (in variousprofessions). Dr. Carroll expressed concern about requiringadditional documentation for social work interns.Marlene Saunders , of the Delaware State University Department of Social Work, stated that her thoughts andconcerns about the proposed regulations echoed Dr.Carroll's. Findings of Fact and Conclusions As outlined in the preceding section, the public was given the required notice of the Board's intention to amendits rules and regulations and was offered an adequateopportunity to provide the Board with comments on theproposed regulations. The Board concludes that itsconsideration of the proposed ru les and reg ulations is within the Board's general authority to promulgate regulationsunder 24 Del.C. \u00a73906(1). Specific statutory authority for the Board's revision of continuing education standards(Proposed Rule 5.0) is found at 24 Del.C. \u00a73906(7). Proposed Rule 5.0 completely revises the current Rule 5.0 pertaining to Continuing Education. Proposed Rule 5.0clarifies the requirements and procedures for hardshipextension requests; allows for credit for certain, pre-approved, self-directed activities, such as teaching andresearch, and clarifies content requirements, includingspecifications of what courses qualify under Categories I andII. The Board finds that the new rules regarding continuing education will provide for a more thorough continuingeducation program and the clarification of the content andcategory requirements will provide better guidance tolicensees. The Board concludes that the revision of Rule 5.0helps the Board implement 24 Del.C. \u00a73906(7) in a way consistent with the interests of the public, the regulatedpractitioners, and the Board's need to process licenserenewals in an orderly and efficient manner. The Board further finds that the modification to Rule 6.3 is necessary to make its definition of \"hardship\" consistentwith that set forth in Rule 5.1.3. The Board finds that new Rule 7.0 pertaining to Ethics will provide licensees with rules and guidelines for theconduct of safe, ethical practice in areas such as clientservices, business practices, confidentiality and clinicalsupervision. The Board concludes that it has the implicitauthority to adopt the proposed rule regarding ethics. TheBoard's authority to adopt rules and regulations is granted bythe General Assembly. As a result, the Board's actions mustbe consistent with the po wer awarded to it by the le gislature and must have a rational relationship to the goals andpolicies expressed in the Board's enabling statutes. See Wilmington Country Club v. Delaware Liquor Comm. , Del. Supr., 91 A.2d 250 (1952). The authority given to the Boardthrough the legislative process should be interpreted to allow\"the fullest accomplishment of the legislative intent orpolicy.\" Atlantis I Condominium Assoc. v. Bryson , Del. Supr., 403 A.2d 711, 713 (1979).FINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001681 The primary objective of the Board of Clinical Social Work Examiners, as enunciated by the General Assembly, isto protect the general public, particularly the recipients ofSocial Work services, from unsafe practices. 24 Del. C. \u00a73901. The secondary objectives of the Board are tomaintain minimum standards of practitioner competence andto maintain standards in the delivery of services to thepublic. Id. In carrying out its objectives, the Board has been granted permission by the legislature to \"deve lop standards\" assuring professional competency. Id. The Board also has authority to monitor complaints against practitioners; tosanction practitioners when necessary and to promulgaterules and regulations. Id. ; see also , 24 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a73906(1)(6)(8)(9); \u00a73915 (Board has authority to discipline licensees for specific violations or conduct); \u00a73913 (statuteprohibits social worker from violating confidentiality). TheBoard finds that the establishment of rules and regulationsregarding ethics will implement these statutory objectives by protecting the public from unsafe and unethical practices andestablishing specific minimum standards of professionalcompetence (ethical behavior) in the delivery of services tothe public. The Board specifically considered the public comment that was received with regard to proposed Rule 7.4.1. TheBoard finds that the informed consent documents used byhospitals could qualify as the \"statement of informedconsent\" under Rule 7.4.1. The Board noted that requiringthe name and telephone number of the supervising LCSW onthe consent form might pose a problem for hospitals andinstitutions if their existing forms do not provide for suchinformation. While the Board does not wish to put an undueburden on institutions, the Board determined that the nameand telephone number requirement is critical and shouldremain in the Rule. It is important for patients and familiesto have access to t his information to know whom they should contact if a problem arises. The Board further notes that theinformed consent requirement applies only to activitieswhich constitute the practice of clinical social work, and not to administrative or adjunctive services. In summary, the Board concludes that the proposed revisions to its Rules and Regulations are necessary for theenforcement of 24 Del. C. Chapter 39, and for the full and effective performance of the Board's duties under thatChapter. The Board also finds that adopting the regulationsas proposed is in the best interest of the citizens of the Stateof Delaware, particularly those persons who are the directrecipients of services provided by the Board's licensees.The Board, therefore, adopts the proposed revisions to itsRules and Regulations as set forth in Exhibit \"A\" attachedhereto.

DIVISION OF PROFESSIONAL REGULATION BOARD OF LICENSED PROFESSIONAL GEOLOGISTS Statutory Authority: 24 Delaware Code, Section 3604 (24 Del.C. 3604) Summary of the Evidence and Information Submitted 1. Exhibit \"B\" is a letter from Michael Apgar, professional geologist. Mr. Apgar suggested that the vastmajority of the geologic work done in Delaware was related to ground water. Mr. Apgar suggested that the Board ofGeologists change its criteria concerning the undergraduateeducation (30 hours of geology credit hours) and that theASBOG exam cover different material. Mr. Apgar notedthat undergraduate institutions have offered multi-disciplinary degrees, such as environmental science andwater resource mana gement, that would be more appropriate educational training for the type of geologic work done inDelaware. Mr. Apgar suggested that the Board of Geologistrequire evidence of training in ground water as a prere quisite to licensure. Mr. Apgar also suggested that work productsbe considered for continuing education credit due to thehardship that might be incurred by working professionalgeologists in meeting education requirements. Findings of Fact 1. Pursuant to 24 Del. C. \u00a73606(1), the Delaware Board of Geologist (the \"Board\") proposed to revise to its rules andregulations as more specifically set forth in the HearingNotice which is attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\" andincorporated herein. 2. Pursuant to 29 Del. C. \u00a710115, notice was given to the public that a hearing would be held on May 5, 2000, at10:00 a.m. in Dover, Delaware to consider the proposedamendments. 3. The notice invited the public to submit comments orally or in writing regarding the proposed amendments. 4. A hearing was held on May 5, 2000, at which a quorum of the Board of Geologists was present. 5. The changes made after the hearing and discussion were non-substantive. 6. The Board of Geologists finds the proposed revisions serve to implement or clarify specific sections of 24 Del. C. Chapter 36. Text and Citation The exact text of the Rules and Regulations hereby promulgated are as it appeared in the Rules and Regulations,Vol. 3, Issue 10 (April 1, 2000) is attached hereto in \"E xhibit A\" with the changes noted. Decision NOW, THEREFORE, based on the Board of Geologists' authority to formulate rules and regulationspursuant to 24 Del.

(h) LAWS AND REGULATIONS Factors including:Applicable State and Federal laws and regulations.8.03 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR COMPETENCY FOR EACH CATEGORY OF COMMERCIALAPPLICATORS Some of the factors referenced in this section are of particular importance because of the different types ofactivities carried out by the applicators in each category. Forexample, practical knowledge of drift problems should berequired of agricultural applicators but not seed treatmentapplicators. The latter, however, should be particularlyknowledgeable of the hazards of the misuse of treated seedand the necessary precautionary techniques. Commercialapplicators in each category shall be particularly qualifiedwith respect to the practical know ledge standards elaborated below. (a) AGRICULTURAL PEST CONTROL CATEGORY (1) AGRICULTURAL PLANT PEST CONTROL SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate practical knowledge of crops grown and the specific pests of thosecrops on which they may be using restricted use pesticides.The importance of such competency is amplified by theextensive areas involved, the quantities of pesticides needed,and the ultimate use of many commodities as food and feed.Practical knowledge is required concerning soil and waterproblems, pre-harvest intervals, re-entry intervals,phytotoxicity, and potential for environmentalcontamination, non-target injury and community problemsresulting from the use of restricted use pesticides inagricultural areas. (2) AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL PEST CONTROL SUBCATEGORY Applicators applying pesticides directly to animals must demonstrate practical knowledge of suchanimals and their associated pests. A practical know ledge is also required concerning specific pesticide toxicity andresidue potential, since host animals will frequently be usedfor food. Further, the applicator must know the relativehazards associated with such factors as formulation,application techniques, age of animals, stress and extent oftreatment. (3) FUMIGATION OF SOIL AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate knowledge of application techniques appropriate to soil fumigation andagricultural product fumigation. This includes the use ofpersonal protective clothing and equipment, and generalsafety procedures such as posting, reentry, aeration, andaccident procedures. (b) FOREST PEST CONTROL CATEGORY Applicators shall demonstrate practical knowledge of types of forests, forest nurseries, and forest seedproduction in Delaware and the pests involved. They shouldpossess practical knowledge of the cyclic occurrence ofFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001699 certain pests and specific population dynamics as a basis for programming pesticide applications. A practical knowledgeis required of the relative biotic agents and their vulnerabilityto the pesticides to be applied. Because forest stands may belarge and frequently include natural aquatic habitats andharbor wildlife, the consequences of pesticide use may bedifficult to assess. The applicator must, therefore,demonstrate practical knowledge of control methods whichwill minimize the possibility of secondary problems such asunintended effects on wildlife. Proper use of specializedequipment must be demonstrated, especially as it may relateto meteorological factors and adjacent land use. (c) ORNAMENTAL AND TURF PEST CONTROL CATEGORY Applicators shall demonstrate knowledge of pesticide problems associated with the production andmaintenance of ornamental trees, shrubs, plantings, and turf,including cognizance of phytotoxicity due to a wide varietyof plant material, drift, and persistence beyond the intendedperiod of pest control. Because of the frequent proximity ofhuman habitations to application activities, applicators inthis category must demonstrate practical knowledge ofapplication methods which will minimize or prevent hazardsto humans, pets, and other domestic animals. (d) SEED TREATMENT CATEGORY Applicators shall demonstrate practical knowledge of types of seeds that require chemical protection againstpests and factors such as seed coloration, carriers, andsurface active agents which influence pesticide binding andmay affect germination. They must demonstrate practicalknowledge of hazards associated with handling, sorting andmixing, and misuse of treated seed such as introduction oftreated seed into food and feed channels, as well as properdisposal of unused treated seeds. (e) AQUATIC PEST CONTROL CATEGORY (1) AQUATIC WEED - Applicators shall demonstrate practical knowledge of the secondary effectswhich can be caused by improper application rates, incorrect formulations, and faulty application of pesticides used in thissubcategory. Further, they must have practical knowledgeconcerning potential pesticide effects on plants, fish, birds,beneficial insects and other organisms which may be presentin aquatic environments. These applicators shall alsodemonstrate practical knowledge of the principles of limitedarea application. (2) ANTIFOULING PAINT - Applicators in this subcategory shall demonstrate practical knowledge of thelabeling instructions, safety precautions and environmentalconcerns associated with the use of marine anti-foulingpaints. They shall demonstrate practical knowledge of theterm \"acceptable release rate\" as it applies to organotinpaints; knowledge of the types of paints approved forspecific hull types; knowledge of the types of anti-foulingpaints approved for use on equipment or containers used forthe harvesting of shellfish; knowledge of potential environmental consequences from the use/misuse orimproper disposal of pesticides; safety precaut ions necessary to avoid exposure of workers to anti-fouling paints; properstorage, handling, and disposal methods of paint chips anddusts suspected of containing organotin compounds; marinepests and relevant life cycles which are controlled throughthe application of anti-fouling paints; methods, procedures,and equipment used in applying organotin and anti-foulingpaints; applicable State and Federal laws and regulations;and recordkeeping requirements under the DelawarePesticide Law. (3) Mosquito Control - Applicators shall demonstrate a practical knowledge of the principlesassociated with the management of mosquitoes, including allof the following: their life cycle; types of formulationsappropriate for their management; methods of application;possible effects on water quality; and, the potential healtheffects on humans in the target area. (f) RIGHT-OF-WAY PEST CONTROL CATEGORY Applicators shall demonstrate a practical knowledge of a wide variety of environmen ts, since right-of- ways can traverse many different terrains, includingwaterways. They shall demonstrate practical knowledge ofproblems on runoff, drift, and excessive foliage destructionand ability to recognize target organisms. They shall alsodemonstrate practical knowledge of the nature of herbicidesand the need for containment of these pesticides within theright-of-way area, and the impact of their applicationactivities in the adjacent areas and communities. (g) INDUSTRIAL, INSTITUTIONAL, STRUCTURAL AND HEALTH RELATED PEST CONTROLCATEGORY Applicators in this category must demonstrate a practical knowledge of a wide variety of pests including theirlife cycles, types of formulation appropr iate for their control, and methods of application that avoid contamination offood, contamination of habitat, and the exposure of peopleand pets. Since human exposure, including babies, children,pregnant women, and elderly people, is frequently apotential problem, applicators must demonstrate practicalknowledge of the specific factors which may lead to ahazardous condition including continuous exposure.Because health related pest control may involve outdoorapplications, applicators must also demonstrate practicalknowledge of environmental conditions particularly relatedto this activity. (1) GENERAL PEST CONTROL SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate knowledge of household pests including but not limited to: pests thatinvade or infest structures, stored products, and residentialfood preparation areas; pests that infest or contaminatefoods and foodstuffs at any stage of processing in the foodFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001700 manufacturing and processing areas of operation including but not limited to: flour mills, bakeries, bottling plants,dairies, canneries, meat packing plants, supermarkets,convenience stores, rest homes, hospitals, ships, vehicles,restaurants, cafeterias, and snack bars; conditions conduciveto infestations and selection appropriate controlprocedures, other than fumigation for each situation; andhazards associated with pesticides in food manufacturingand processing. (2) WOOD DESTROYING PEST CONTROL SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate knowledge of organisms that destroy structures made of wood includingbut not limited to beetles, termites and fungi, and conditions conducive to infestation; selection, calibration, and use ofappropriate control procedures and their related equipmentincluding: rodding and trenching, topical application ofpesticides and local injection of specially labeled liquid orpressurized aerosol pesticides into infested wood; hazardsinvolved in the handling and use of these pesticides. (3) FUMIGATION (NON-AGRICULTURAL) SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate a practical knowledge of the conditions requiring the application offumigants, and the selection of the most appropriatefumigation methods to use; equipment used in fumigationincluding but not limited to application, monitoring, testing,calculating, and personal protective devices; release,distribution, and maintenance of the correct fumigantconcentrations for the product being used and the structurebeing fumigated under differing conditions; and hazardsinvolved in the use of fumigants. (4) WOOD PRESERVATIVE SUBCATEGORY Applicators must demonstrate a practical knowledge of the pests involved with wood products,including their life cycles, wood degradation, the pesticidesavailable for controlling such problems, and methods ofapplication including pressure, non-pressure and brush-ontreatments. Since there is concern regarding the potential forenvironmental contamination as well as acute and chronichealth problems from applicator exposure when usingcertain woodtreating pesticides, specific emphasis will beplaced upon demonstrating a practical knowledge of theproduct use, precautions which are required and found onthe labels and labeling of these pesticides and includeprotective clothing and equipment, sanitation procedures,disposal procedures and environmental precautions. Sincetreated wood products present potential environmentalproblems and acute and chronic exposure problems to theusers and the general public, whether or not they come intodirect contact with the treated wood, applicators mustdemonstrate a practical knowledge of the consumerinformation covering use, site, and handling precautionswhich are found in the Consumer Information Sheets ofproducts registered for pressure treatment and in the labeling for products registered for sap and stain control, ground linetreatment of utility poles, and home and farm use (includingrailroad tie repair). (5) INSTITUTIONAL AND MAINTENANCE SUBCATEGORY Applicators in this subcategory must demonstrate a practical knowledge of a wide variety of pestsfor the purpose of providing structural pest control or lawnpest control in and around schools, hospitals, nursing homes,child day-care centers, and apartment buildings. Sincechildren and elderly people have a potentially highersensitivity to pesticides, applicators in this subcategoryshould be particularly knowledgeable in avoidingapplications which may lead to a hazardous condition,including continuous exposure. (6) COOLING TOWER SUBCATEGORY Applicators shall demonstrate a practical knowledge of the labeling instructions, safety precautionsand environmental concerns associated with the use ofpesticides to treat the waters of cooling towers.

(d) Recognize local environmental situations that must be considered during application to avoidcontamination. (e) Recognize poisoning symptoms and procedures to follow in case of a pesticide accident. 9.02 Such competence of each private applicator shall be verified through the administration of a private applicatorcertification system here described which ensures that the private applicator is competent, based upon the standards setforth above, to use the restricted use pesticides underlimitations of applicable State and Federal laws andregulations. One or more of the following options will beemployed to certify private applicators: (a) GENERAL CERTIFICATION This option certifies the private applicator as competent to apply any restricted use pesticide which hewould normally expect to use in his particular agriculturaloperations. Competency determination shall reflect allaspects of the private applicator standards and shall be broadenough to test the private applicator's ability to apply generalprinciples to specific problems associated with the restricteduse pesticides required for the production and protection ofhis crops. (b) PESTICIDE CLASS CERTIFICATION This option certifies the private applicator as competent to apply any restricted use pesticide products andall different formulations of a pesticide used for the samepurpose, use, or application. Examples include, but are notlimited to, preemergence herbicides for vegetable crops,foliar insecticides on corn, rodenticides in fruit orchards,nematicides in fields prior to planting, gr ound application of fungicides on vegetables, seed treatments for plant diseases,and livestock dips for insect control. Competency determination shall reflect the full range of the private applicator standards, but with specialemphasis placed on the particular characteristics of thepesticide class, as well as the nature of the application oruse. (c) COMMODITY/CROP/SITE CERTIFICATION This option certifies the private applicator as competent to apply any restricted use pesticide needed forspecific crops or sites which the applicator would beexpected to deal with in his agricultural operations.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Statutory Authority: 14 Delaware Code, Section 122(d) (14 Del.C. 122(d)) Before the Department of Education Of the State of Delaware Regulatory Implementing Order Children with Disabilities I. Summary Of The Evidence And Information Submitted At its April 20, 2000 meeting, the State Board of Education consented to the Acting Secretary of Education'sadoption of regulations on Children with Disabilities. Assuggested in the Board's April 20, 2000 \"ImplementingOrder\", the Acting Secretary now seeks the Board's consentto further amend these regulations. As with the changesapproved in April, the primary purpose of the proposedamendments is to assure compliance with the 1997amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") and its federal implementing regulations. The currently proposed revisions address Interagency and Special Programs, Funding, Other State AgencyResponsibilities and Children in Private Schools/UniqueEducational Alternatives. If adopted, the proposedregulations will be incorporated in the Department's newFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001710 technical assistance document, the Administrative Manual for Special Education Services (\"AMSES\"), along with the regulations approved by the Board on April 20, 2000. The Department solicited informal comments and input regarding the revisions to AMPEC in 1998 and 1999 from District Directors/Supervisors of Special Education and fromthe Governor's Advisory Council for Exceptional Citizens.Notice of the currently proposed amendments, includinginformation on submitting formal comments, was publishedin the News Journal and the Delaware State News on March 13, 2000 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. The proposed regulations also appeared in the Delaware Register of Regulations on March 1, 2000, at 3 DE Reg. 1151-1165 (March 1, 2000) and were distributed to the ChiefSchool Officers, the Governor's Advisory Council forExceptional Citizens, Delaware School Boards Association,Delaware State Education Association, and the DelawareAssociation of School Administrators in February, 2000. Inaddition, public hearings on the proposed regulations wereheld on March 7, 2000 and March 8, 2000 at two differentlocations in the State. Notice of these public hearingsappeared in the News Journal and the Delaware State News on February 14, 2000 in the form attached hereto as ExhibitB. Most of the comments received were directed to editing, style and clarity of wording. The Department agrees withthese suggestions and has incorporated them into theproposed regulations as nonsubstantive changes. Othercomments were considered, but did not result in changes.These items are summarized in Exhibit C, attached hereto. II. Findings Of Fact The Acting Secretary finds that it is necessary to further amend these regulations because of the 1997 federalreauthorization and revision of the IDEA and the 1999 federal adoption of the IDEA implementing regulations. The Department has also determined that the editing and changes made to the published proposal are not substantive and maybe adopted without additional opportunity for publiccomment. The Acting Secretary also finds that the proposed regulations (including the nonsubstantive changes made tothem as a result of public comment) are consistent with thefederal requirements and with Chapter 31 of Title 14 of theDelaware Code . The changes also help clarify the various statutory and regulatory requirements and impact for schooldistricts and parents. The Acting Secretary declines to adopt the following sections of proposed regulations for the reasons stated. \u007f Section 20.0 \"Special Programs for Children who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing.\" This proposed regula-tion would have continued the duties of the State Com-mittee for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. The Department received several comments that the regula-tion was inconsistent with the role of the IEP team asdeveloped in the 1997 federal revisions and no longerserved a useful purpose. The Department agrees that theCommittee's function is no longer appropriate in lightof the federal revisions and thus, declines to adopt thissection.\u007f Section 22.2, \"The Statewide Monitoring ReviewBoard.\" As proposed, this regulation would have con-tinued the composition and duties of this Board as previ-ously constituted. The Department received manycomments from parents of children with autism, theAutism Society of Delaware and others, suggest ing sub- stantial changes to the Board. The Acting Secretary hasdetermined that this proposed regulation should berevised in light of these comments. Finally, the Acting Secretary notes that in April, the Department declined to adopt several sections of proposedregulations as a result of public comments it received. Inaddition, the Department has concluded that Section 22.2 ofthe current proposed revisions requires substantive change,as discussed above. These sections are being revised andwill be republished for additional public comment. TheDepartment anticipates that all of the proposed sectionsrequiring substantive changes, whether from the first orsecond group of proposed regulations, will be republishedand presented to the Board during the summer of 2000. III. Decision To Amend The Current Regulations For the foregoing reasons, the Acting Secretary concludes that it is necessary to amend its regulations onChildren with Disabilities. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter31 of Title 14 of the Delaware Code , the regulations attached hereto as Exhibit D are adopted. Pursuant to theprovisions of 14 Del.C. \u00a7122(e), the amended regulations shall be in effect for a period of not more than five yearsfrom the effective date of this order as set forth in Section V.below. IV. Text And Citation The text of the adopted re gulations shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D and shall become part of theRegulations of the Department of Education. V. Effective Date Of Order The actions hereinabove referred to were taken by the Acting Secretary pursuant to 14 Del.C. Chapter 31, in open session at the State Board's regularly scheduled meeting onMay 18, 2000. The effective date of this Order shall be tenFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001711 (10) days from the date this Order is published in the Delaware Register of Regulations . IT IS SO ORDERED this 18th day of May, 2000. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONValerie A Woodruff Acting Secretary of Education Approved this 18th day of May, 2000.STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION Dr. James L. Spartz, PresidentJean W. Allen, Vice PresidentMary B. Graham, Jr.Dr. Joseph A. PikaDennis J. SavageDr. Claibourne D. Smith Summary Of Other Public Comments The Department received comments in the following areas, but has declined to revise the proposed regulation for thereasons noted. \u007f Sections 22.7.9.1.1 and 22.7.9.1.2: The Autism Society of Delaware suggested enlarging the proposeddeadline for submitting procedural descriptions ofbehavior management procedures to the Human Rightsand Peer Review Committees. The proposed timeframes are the same as the current ones and have caused no past complaint or problem.\u007f Section 23.4: The Governor's Advisory Councilfor Exceptional Citizens (GACEC) proposed establish-ing timelines and more detailed notification proceduresfor ICT reviews and the use of email, fax and handdelivery of documents to expedite processing. The pro-posed procedure is the one currently used with few com-plaints or problems.\u007f The GACEC suggested additional regulations con-cerning responsibility for the education and monitoringof education when a student is placed by an agencyother than the Department. The Department believesthat this issue is better addressed through interagencyagreements and is currently developing such an agree-ment with the Department of Services to Children,Youth and their Families.\u007f The federal regulations require the Department toreview and revise its policies if it identifies discrepan-cies in suspension and expulsion rates among specialeducation students. The GACEC requested that theDepartment articulate in regulations how it will address any identified discrepancies. The Department believesthat policy changes required by any identified discrep-ancies should occur in consultation with the Partner'sCouncil for Children with Disabilities rather than viaregulation.\u007f The GACEC requested that the Department estab-lish timetables for activities related to federal monitor-ing. The Comprehensive Compliance MonitoringSystem (CCMS) is currently under major modificationand will result in a new Monitor's handbook which will address activities and timetables without the need forregulations.\u007f The Disabilities Law Program recommended thatthe ICT be responsible for parental notification of ICTreview. The Department believes that this duty shouldremain with the district because the IEP team makes thedecision to present applications for funding to the ICT. \u007f The GACEC requested that a regulation be added toclarify that the IEP team, not the ICT, has the authorityto determine a student's educational placement. TheDepartment believes that the respective duties of theIEP team and the ICT are already clearly distinguishedin proposed Section 23.1 (role of the ICT is to providesupport for student placement) and Section 23.7 (dis-tricts and agencies may make placements independentof the ICT).\u007f The GACEC suggested that proposed Section 25.2include: (1) a definition of \"special school\"; (2) arequirement that aides not be authorized to substitute forteachers; and (3) a requirement that each class have aminimum of one teacher. The proposed section is thesame as the current regulation and the Departmentdeclines at this time to adopt these additional regula-tions.\u007f The Disabilities Law Program requested regula-tions regarding the licensing and supervision of residen-tial group homes operated by the Delaware AutisticProgram. The Department has begun discussions withthe Department of Health and Social Services and theDepartment of Services for Children, Youth and TheirFamilies around this issue and will propose additionalregulations in this area as necessary.

For the purposes of this Policy Regulation, calculated points are credited at full point valuefor the first twelve months from the date of the violation.After the initial 12 months have expired, the calculatedpoints will be credited at (\u00bd) point value for the next 12months. The Division will only take action based uponconvictions accumulated within the 24-month periodfollowing the date of the offense. 7. Moving Violations. Those violations contained in 21 Del.C. Chapters 27, Chapter 41 and Chapter 42, excluding those violations that require mandatorysuspension or revocation actions. Multiple violationsoccurring within a 24-hour period shall be consideredindividual violations for the purposes of this policyregulation. 8. Advisory Letter. The Division will send anFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001749 advisory letter to those drivers who accumulate 8 calculatedpoints or when convicted of speeding 20 - 24 MPH over the posted limit. The purpose of the advisory letter is to expressour concern about the operator's driving habits and theirimpact upon highway safety. The letter will inform thedriver about the Driver Improvement Problem DriverProgram. An advisory letter may be sent for both pointaccumulations and excessive speed violations. 9. Record Review. The goal of the record review is to assess any problems the driver may have and require acourse of action. The record review may result in a driverimprovement interview/counseling session, medical orvision examination, knowledge and/or skills testing,restricted license, license suspension or the surrender of alicense. 10. Interviews. The Driver Improvement staff may schedule the driver to attend an interview based upon therecord review. The licensee may request an interview with aDriver Improvement Officer or staff member when notifiedof pending action against them. The following issues areopen to discussion: \u007f The driver may request an additional 90 days to complete a mandatory attendance at the \"behaviormodification/attitudinal driving course\" or theymay request a license suspension in lieu ofattending the program. Any further delays incompleting the program must be approved by theDriver Improvement Manager or the Chief ofDriver Services. \u007f The driver can present evidence that the convictions on their driving record belong to another driver. Ifproven, the convictions will be removed. \u007f If the violation on record is under appeal by the court, the driver must submit a copy of the appealbond and the violation will be removed from thedriving record. If applicable, the suspension actionresulting from this violation be removed from thedriving record. \u007f The Driver Improvement staff may require the driver to complete a medical or vision examination,pass a knowledge or skill test or restrict theirdriving privileges based upon the results of theinterview. \u007f This policy regulation shall have no effect on the revocation actions, medical qualifications orrequirements, or suspension action required bystatue unrelated to this policy. V. Severability If any part of this Rule is held to be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to law by a court of competentjurisdiction, said portion shall be severed and the remainingportions of this rule shall remain in full force and effectunder Delaware law. VI. Effective Date The following regulations shall be effective 10 days from the date the order is signed and it is published in itsfinal form in the Register of Regulations in accordance with29 Del. C. \u00a710118(e). Brian J. Bushweller, SecretaryDepartment of Public D. of Motor Vehicles4/11/00 Policy Regulation Number 90 Concerning: Aggressive Drivers I. Authority This Regulation is adopted pursuant to 21 Del.C. Section 4175A and promulgated in accordance with 21Del.C. Section 302 and with the procedures specified in the Administrative Procedures Act, 29 Del.C. Section 10115. II. Purpose This policy regulation establishes administrative procedures used to administer the aggressive driver programas outlined in 21 Del.C. Section 4175A. Aggressive driving is defined in terms of existing Title 21 offenses such asfailure to yield, unsafe lane change, disregarding a trafficcontrol device, failure to stop, following too closely, passingon a shoulder and speeding. Individuals convicted of three ormore of these offenses as a result of continuous conduct areguilty of aggressive driving and are subject to increasedpenalties. Offenders are required to complete a course ofinstruction established by the Secretary of Public Safety toaddress behavior modification or attitudinal drivingproblems. The Secretary administers the course andprograms, adopts rules and regulations therefor andestablishes a fee schedule for enrollment in the programs thatwill not exceed the maximum fine that may be imposedunder the statute. III. Duties and Responsibilities A. Duties and Responsibilities of the Division of Motor Vehicles. 1. When convicted of aggressive driving, the court will send the Division of Motor Vehicles' DriverFINAL REGULATIONS DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001750 Improvement Section a copy of the court order directing the driver to complete a course of instruction to address behaviormodification or attitudinal driving problems andrecommending suspension of the driver's license or drivingprivileges for failure to attend the course. 2. The driver is responsible for contacting the Division of Motor Vehicles Driver Improvement Section.That Division will provide them information concerning thecourse(s) established or approved by this State. 3. If the driver is licensed in another state, the driver may either attend an established course taught inDelaware or attend a similar course taught in their homestate. The driver must submit documentation from thelicensing agency or from the school providing the trainingoutlining the length of the training, course syllabus, and anyother information needed to evaluate the alternative course.The Aggressive Driving Committee will evaluate andapprove or disapprove out-of-state courses. If the out-of-state licensed driver fails to contact the Division or tocomplete the course within 90 days, the Division will notifythe convicting court. The court will hold a non-compliancehearing and will, at its discretion, either issue a failure tocomply order or will allow the driver/defendant to re-enterthe program. A copy of all non-compliance orders issuedwill be forwarded to DMV for them to suspend the licensee'sdriving privileges pursuant to 21 Del. C. Section 2733(c). The Division will forward the failure to comply order to thestate-licensing agency in which the driver is licensed. If thelicensee, through no fault of his own, is unable to completethe course within the 90-day period, the Driver ImprovementSection may extend the required completion date by anadditional 90 days upon written request. 4. If a Delaware licensed driver has not contacted the Division or has not completed the required course within90 days after the conviction, the Driver ImprovementSection will notify the convicting court. The court will holda non-compliance hearing and will, at its discretion, eitherissue a failure to comply order or will allow the driver/defendant to re-enter the program. A copy of all non-compliance orders issued will be forwarded to DMV forthem to suspend the license. The Division will suspend theirdriver's license upon direction of the court pursuant to 21Del. C. Section 2731(a). The license may be reinstated once the course is completed and the appropriate fees paid. Anoccupational license will not be issued during the period ofthe suspension. If the licensee, through no fault of his own, isunable to complete the course within the 90-day period, theDriver Improvement Section may extend the requiredcompletion date by an additional 90 days upon writtenrequest. 5. The Driver Improvement Section will notify the court when the aggressive driver comp letes the required training course. B. Duties and Responsibilities of the Office ofHighway Safety.

TITLE OF THE REGULATIONS: Case-by-Case Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Determinations2. BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE SUBJECT,SUBSTANCE AND ISSUES: The Department is proposing to submit to the EPA for inclusion in the Delaware State Implementation Plan (SIP)four Case-by-Case NO X RACT determinations. These determinations have been made pursuant to Regulation No.12, NO X RACT, of the State of Delaware \"Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution.\" SPI Polyols, Inc.,CitiSteel, and General Chemical Corporation are affected bythese determinations.3. POSSIBLE TERMS OF THE AGENCY ACTION: None. 4. STATUTORY BASIS OR LEGAL AUTHORITY TOACT: 7 Del. C., Chapter 60 and Regulation No. 12 of the State of Delaware \"Regulations Governing the Control ofAir Pollution.\" 5. OTHER REGULATIONS THAT MAY BEAFFECTED BY THE PROPOSAL: None. 6. NOTICE OF PUBLIC COMMENT: A public hearing will be held on these determinations on June 21, 2000 beginning at 6:00 p.m. in the Department'sfacility located at 715 Grantham Lane, New CastleDelaware. Comments may be made at the hearing, orsubmitted to the Department in writing not later than theclose of business, June 30, 2000.7. PREPARED BY: Ronald A. Amirikian/(302)323-4542Case-by-Case Nitrogen Oxides (NO X) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Determinations under Regulation No. 12 of the State of Delaware \"Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution.\" The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NOX emissions through RACT are set out in section 182(f) of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). Section 182(f)requires ozone nonattainment areas classified moderate orabove to apply the same requirements to major stationarysources of NO X as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Delaware is composed of three (3) air quality management areas: Kent, New Castle, and Sussex counties.Kent and New Castle Counties are classified as severe ozonenonattainment areas, and all three counties are located in theozone transport region that was established under Section184 of the CAA. Section 182 of the CAA requires all major sources of VOCs (and thus NO X) in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas, and in any ozone transportregion to install RACT. This means that any major source ofNO X emissions in Delaware must install RACT. The major source threshold for NOX is 25 tons per year (TPY) in Kent and New Castle counties and 100 TPY in Sussex county. Effective November 24, 1993 the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC)promulgated Regulation No. 12 of the State of Delaware\"Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution\" as ameans to define and impose NO X RACT requirements on major sources of NOX in Delaware. Regulation No. 12 defines RACT as \"the lowest emission limit for NOX that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application ofcontrol technology that is reasonably available consideringtechnological and economic feasibility.\" Sections 3.2 through 3.6 of Re gulation No. 12 prescribe RACT for most categories of combustion sources as aspecific equipment requirement and/or an emissionlimitation. In addition, Sections 3.2 through 3.5 ofRegulation No. 12 allow for the submission, evaluation, andapproval of a case-by-case equivalent RACT determinationthat may replace the specific equipment requirement oremission limitation specified in those sections. TheDepartment knows of no equivalent RACT determinationsthat must be processed under Section 3.2 through 3.5 ofRegulation No. 12. Sources not regulated under Sections 3.2 thr ough 3.6 of Regulation No. 12, and not exempted under Section 4 ofRegulation No. 12 are covered under Sections 3.8 and 6 ofRegulation No. 12. Section 3.8 required major NO X emitting sources to: a) Notify the Department of their applicabilityGENERAL NOTICES DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001756 status, and b) Submit a determination as to what constitutes reasonably available control technology for the sourceincluding technical and economic support documentation,and c) Provide a schedule, acceptable to the Department, for implementing the RACT program asexpeditiously as possible, but not later than May 31, 1995,including interim dates for the issuance of purchase orders,start and completion of modifications, and completion ofcompliance testing. Section 6.1(b) requires sources subject to Section 3.8 of Regulation No. 12 to identify equipment or processadditions, modifications, or adjustments to reduce NO X emissions, and to provide to the Department technical andeconomical data that supports the proposed RACT proposal. Pursuant to Sections 3.8 and 6 of Regulation No. 12, the Department received case-by-case NO X RACT submissions for the following four (4) proc esses: Company SPI Polyols, Inc. Polyhydrate Alcohol's Process CitiSteel Electric Arc FurnaceGeneral Chemical Corp. Sulfuric Acid Process and Interstage Absorption System General Chemical Corp. Metallic Nitrite Process For each alternate RACT proposal received, Section 5.1 of Regulation No. 12 requires the Department to approve,deny, or modify the RACT determination proposed. Section5.2 of Regulat ion No. 12 provides that upon receipt of notice of the Department's approval of the RACT proposal, thesource shall begin implementing the RACT programaccording to the schedule established in the approved RACTplan. Finally Section 5.3 of Regulation No. 12 requires theDepartment to submit each RACT determination made under Section 5 of Regulation No. 12 to the EnvironmentalProtection Agency for approval as a revision to the StateImplementation Plan (SIP). On June 16, 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the federal register (Volume 64, Number115, Pages 32187-32189) a final rule granting conditionallimited approval of Delaware's 1993 request to includeRegulation No. 12 into Delaware's SIP. \"Conditional\" Nature of Approval: The EPA's June 16, 1999 final rule requires Delaware to submit to the EPA allalternative RACT determinations approved under Section 5of Regulation No. 12, and to certify by no later than July 17,2000 that it has submitted to the EPA all such determinationsfor all currently known subject sources. Once this is done,the \"conditional\" nature of EPA's approval will be removed. \"Limited\" Nature of Approval: Once the EPA receives, in fulfillment of the requirement described above, andapproves all alternative RACT determinations that theDepartment has approved under Section 5 of Regulation No.12, the limited nature of the approval will be removed; andRegulation No. 12 will be fully approved. Subparts F and Appendix V of 40 CFR Part 51 prescribe the procedure States are to follow when submitting to theEPA any revision to that State's SIP. Such proceduresinclude the holding of a properly noticed public hearing, thesubmittal to the EPA of evidence showing the adherence tospecific procedural requirements (e.g., evidence of legalauthority, certification that a public hearing was held, etc.),and technical support documentation. The following is a description of each of the four case- by-case NO X RACT determinations: SPI Polyols, Inc . Atlas Point Site 321 Cherry Lane New Castle, DE 19720 Polyhydrate Alcohol's Catalyst Regenerative Process with NOx Scrubber Process Description This is a batch process involving the treatment of spent nickel catalyst from the sugar reduction process and itssubsequent conversion to a \"green catalyst\" slurry that isfiltered and dried for reuse. The preparation of this slurryinvolves several steps in which nitric acid is used. Amongthem are nickel metal dissolution for nickel makeup, nickelrecovery from process waste streams and the digestion ofspent catalyst. Of these, the last two are the ones mainlyrelated to the formation of nitrogen oxides. The spent catalyst is initially reacted under controlled conditions of temperature, agitation and pH with nitric acid.During this first conversion, nickel nitrate (Ni(NO 3)2) is formed once the nitric acid is added. During the course of this reaction nitrogen oxides are occasionally formed.Further steps take the nickel nitrate into a usableintermediate: nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH) 2), which in turn is treated elsewhere for conversion to its active form before it is used in the process. The key chemical reaction (not balanced) involved in the digestion process is as follows: NiO + HNO3 Ni(NO3)2 + NOX + H2O NOX Emission Information NOX is given off from this process in the reactionGENERAL NOTICES DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001757 between spent catalyst and nitric acid. The emission is predominately associated with the addition of nitric acid tothe digester tanks. Stack testing of the process was conducted on November 16 through 18, 1993. The Department witnessedand reviewed the results of this testing and determined that,while there were some deviations from the test protocol, theresults are credible and representative of NO X emissions. This testing indicated an average emission rate of 0.8 lb/hr, or 3.5 TPY of NOX based on continuous operation. This batch process is not in and of itself a major NOX emitting source, rather it is subject to RACT requirements because it is located at a fa cility that is a major NOX emitting source. RACT Analysis Control of NOX from the process is by two means: 1) process control and 2) operation of a counter flow packed column scrubber and a cross-flow spray scrubbing system. Process Control : NOX formation occurs predominantly due to fuming in the digester tanks, which is associated with an exothermic reaction when nitric acid isadded to a digester tank. Stack testing conducted in 1993confirmed a high correlation between the addition of nitricacid to a digester tank and the emission of NO X. The formation of NOX is minimized by submerged nitric acid fill in the mixing zone of each digester tank, adding nitric acid to only one digester tank at a time, and by controlling the rateof nitric acid addition and dig ester tank temperature to a rate and temperature established in accordance with good airpollution control practices. Scrubbing System : Off-gas swept from the digester tanks passes through a scrubbing system prior to release tothe atmosphere. The scrubbing system consists of two waterspray nozzles used to reduce the inlet temperature, a counter-current packed column scrubber with plastic packing, an airdilution valve to promote the oxidation of any NO to NO 2, all followed by another water spray washer. The Department believes that at the temperatures (70-120 oF), NOX concentrations (~5 to 350 ppmv) and flow rates (2000-9000 SCFM) present in the off gas system, the rate of reaction of NO to NO2 is too slow to affect noticeable reductions of NO, beyond a slight removal by the various water contacts. However, the Departmentbelieves that because NO 2 is very soluble in water and that it decomposes to form nitric acid the removal of NO2 is high. Measurements of the pH of the scrubber blow down show that the pH fluctuates between neutral or slightly acidic tostrongly acidic. This indicates 1) NO X is not continuously generated throughout the batch process (see \"processcontrol\" portion of RACT limitation above), and 2) the scrubbing system is reducing the quantity of NOX being emitted to the atmosphere (i.e., by promoting the reaction of NO2 with the H2O to form HNO3). RACT Applicable Requirements Operational Limits A. Nitric acid shall be added using a submerged feed, in the mixing zone, and to only one digester tank at anyparticular time. B. The nitric acid addition rate to each digester tank shall not exceed a rate established in accordance with goodair pollution control practices, accepted by the Department,and made federally enforceable. C. Nitric acid shall be added to a digester tank only when the temperature of the liquid in that digester tank iswithin a range established in accordance with good airpollution control practices, accepted by the Department, andmade federally enforceable. D. All emissions to the atmosphere from any digester tank shall pass through a water scrubber that is operated andmaintained in accordance with the manufacture'sspecification and in accordance with good air pollutioncontrol practices. E. The pressure drop across the scrubber shall not fall outside of a range established in accordance with good airpollution control practices, accepted by the Department, andmade federally enforceable. F. There shall be no visible emissions from the water scrubber.

CitiSteel USA, Inc. 4001 Philadelphia Pike Claymont, Delaware 19703 Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) Regulated Pollutants Affected: This determination only pertains to the regulation of the ozone precursor, nitrogen oxides (NO X). Process Description The EAF operated by CitiSteel USA, Inc. is a 150 tons per charge rated capacity, batch process which producesmolten steel by melting steel scrap. It consists of a large steel cylindrical vessel equipped with a removable roofthrough which three (3) retractable carbon electrodes areinserted. The electrodes are lowered through the r oof of the furnace and are energized by an alternating current, creatingarcs that melt the steel scrap charge with their heat.Additional heat is produced by the resistance of the metal inthe arc paths. Temperatures inside the EAF reach 3,000 to3,400 degrees Fahrenheit. The operation includes anoxygen-fuel door burner, specifically designed forpreheating and cutting cold scrap in the EAF. The oxygen-fuel burner is rated at 14 MMBTU/hr and uses natural gas asfuel in conjunction with a pure oxygen supply. Once themelting cycle is completed, the carbon electrodes are raised,the roof is removed, and the vessel is tilted to pour themolten metal in a ladle pot. NO X Emission Information The predominate source of NOX is thermal NOX formed from nitrogen in the ambient air. To a much smaller extent, NOX is formed from the oxidation of nitrogen contained in the scrap steel charge, and the oxygen-fuel burner. A Stack Test of the EAF conducted on April 24 and 25, 1996 quantified the emission rate of NOX to be an average of 0.36 lb. of NOX per ton of steel produced. Based on 0.36 lb/ ton and 540,000 tons of steel produced per this equates to an annual NOX emission of 97.2 tons per year. The EAF is in and of itself a major NOX emitting source, and is subject to the requirements of Regulation No. 12. RACT Analysis Typical controls practiced on fuel fired combustion equipment such as low NOX burners, flue gas recirculation, selective catalytic reduction, etc. are not transferable to an EAF because of the lack of typical burner assemblies, andthe unstable gas temperature, air flow and high particulateconcentrations. Several technical information sources weresearched in an attempt to find NO X control information relative to EAF's. The results of this search are as follows: A review of the EPA's Clean Air Technology Center RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse revealed noinformation regarding application of NO X controls for EAF's. The EPA has not published or proposed any new source performance standard (NSPS) for EAF's relative tocontrol of NO X emissions. EPA's document \"Alternative Control Techniques Document - NOX Emissions from Iron and Steel Mills\", Section 5.3.5, Electric Arc Furnaces, states \"There is no information that NOX emissions controls have been installedGENERAL NOTICES DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001759 on EAF's or that suitable controls are available.\" No other information relevant to NOX emissions control of EAF's was identified. Based on this information the Department agrees with CitiSteel's conclusion that NOX controls are not technologically feasible on EAF's, and that current operation represents RACT for the EAF. RACT Applicable Requirements The Department imposes no additional applicable requirements on the EAF under Regulation No. 12 ofDelaware's \"Regulations Governing the Control of AirPollution.\" General Chemical Corporation 6300 Philadelphia Pike Claymont, DE 19703 Sulfuric Acid Process and Interstage Absorption System Regulated Pollutants Affected: This determination only pertains to the regulation of the ozone precursor, nitrogen oxides (NO X). Process Description The sulfuric acid process and interstage absorption system (ISA) is a contact sulfuric acid manufacturingprocess. The three main sub-processes include 1) theburning of elemental sulfur, spent sulfuric acid, andhydrogen sulfide to generate SO 2, 2) the catalytic oxidation of the SO2 to SO3, and 3) the absorption of SO3 into strong H2SO4 solution to form H2SO4. The burning sub-process incorporates two burner/boilers with each having a rated heat input capacity of forty-six (46) MMBTU/hr. NOX Emission Information NOX emissions are generated only during the combustion sub-process (i.e., the burning of elemental sulfur, spent sulfuric acid, and hydrogen sulfide). Stack testing on May 5, 1999 indicated that the NOX emission rate from the ISA was 10.44 lb/hr (26.74 ppm).This equates to an annual NO X emission of forty-four (44) tons per year assuming continuous operation at this emission rate. The ISA is in and of itself a major stationary source of NOX, and is subject to the Requirements of Regulation No. 12. RACT Analysis This combustion operation is not covered under Section 3.3 of Regulation No. 12 since Section 3.3 covers only fuelburning equipment whose primary purpose is to produce heat to be used; the primary purpose of burning the sulfur isto produce SO 2. Evidence of this is the need to cool the exhaust from the burners prior to the next step in the process and after other steps in the process (i.e., the oxidation andabsorption steps are highly exothermic). Section 3.3 doesnot apply and the process must be evaluated under Section3.8 of Regulation No. 12. Under Section 3.8 of Regulation No. 12, the Department considered the feasibility of both minimizing the generationof NO X and the installation and operation of post- combustion NOX removal technologies. NOX Generation. Sulfur provides the majority of heat input to the burners, and is by definition a low NOX fuel (i.e., low fuel bound NOX). This means that all of the NOX generated is thermal NOX. Combustion occurs at 1,700 to 2,000 oF, which is a relatively low temperature with regard to thermal NOX generation dynamics. Because of the low fuel NOX, the low combustion temperature, and the fact that all of the combustion gases are an integral part of the ISA process, theDepartment agrees with General Chemical that combustionmodifications are not feasible relative to RACT. Add-on NO X removal technologies. Several technical information sources were searched in an attempt to find NOX control information relative to sulfuric acid manufacturing. The results of this search are as follows: A review of the EPA's Clean Air Technology Center RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse revealed noinformation regarding application of NO X controls to sulfuric acid manufacturing. The EPA has not published or proposed any new source performance standard (NSPS) for sulfuric acidmanufacturing relative to control of NO X emissions. No other information relevant to NOX emissions control of sulfuric acid manufacturing was identified. It is noted that approximately \u00be of the NOX produced passes through the converters, absorbers, and ISA, and that these process components remove a portion of the NOX generated. While SO3 is absorbed in strong H2SO4, the NOX in the gas stream is also absorbed to form nitrogen containing compounds and impurities. General Chemical evaluated several NOX removal technologies and, based on economics, conclude they were not feasible. Such evaluation addressed SCR and wetscrubbing. Relevant factors contributing to the high cost areGENERAL NOTICES DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001760 the low concentration of NOX in the exhaust stream and the high flow (i.e., 26.74 ppm and 54,737 scfm from the 1999 stack test). For comparison purposes, Table 1 of Re gulation No. 12 defines RACT for combustion units with a maximum heatinput capacity of equal to or greater than 100 MMBTU/hrand firing liquid fuel as 0.25 lb/mmBTU heat input; the NO X emission rate from this process is 0.20 lb/mmBTU. TheDepartment believes this low emission rate is attributable tothe fuel being combusted (i.e., liquid sulfur), the relatively low combustion temperature (i.e., 1,700 to 2, 000 oF) and the NOX absorption in the ISA itself. Because of this information, and considering the Company's economic analysis that add-on NOX removal technology is not cost effective, the Department agrees with General Chemical that the current status of the process is RACT. RACT Applicable Requirements The Department imposes no additional applicable requirements on the Sulfuric Acid Process and InterstageAbsorption System under Regulation No. 12 of Delaware's\"Regulations Governing the Control of Air Pollution.\" General Chemical Corporation 6300 Philadelphia Pike Claymont, DE 19703 Metallic Nitrite Process with Caustic Scrubber Regulated Pollutants Affected: This determination only pertains to the regulation of the ozone precursor, nitrogen oxides (NO X). Process Description This process is a batch process that produces potassium nitrite (50% solution). The process involves reacting acontrolled mixture of air and ammonia over a catalyst. Thecatalyst converts the air-ammonia mixture into nitric oxide,nitrogen dioxide, and water vapor. This mixture is absorbed into potassium hydroxide circulating through an absorbingtower to form potassium nitrite. The reactions are as follows: 4 NH 3 + 5 O2 4 NO + 6 H2O 2 NO + O2 2 NO2 NO + NO2 + 2 KOH 2 KNO2 + H2O The potassium nitrite solution is stored, filtered, and used to make crystal. NOX Emission Information NOX emissions are generated in the reaction of the air/ammonia mixture over a catalyst. Based on a 1982 stack test, General Chemical estimates the maximum controlled NOX emission rate is 10 lb/hr and the potential to emit NOX is 43.8 tons per year. The metallic nitrite process is in and of itself a major NOX emitting source, and is subject to the requirements of Regulation No. 12. RACT Analysis Control of NOX from this process is by two means: 1) process control, and 2) operation of a counter flow packed column scrubber. Process Control : The rate that NOX forms is proportional to the rate of the air/ammonia mixture fed to the process. Early in the batch when the free alkalinity in the absorption tray tower ishigh, the majority of the NO X formed is absorbed by the process in the absorption tray tower. As the batch progresses, the free alkalinity in the tray tower liquiddecreases, and the NO X feed rate to the scrubber increases. Towards the end of each batch the free alkalinity in the absorption tray tower is near zero, and practically all of theNO X generated passes through to the scrubber. Because of this, the NOX inlet rate to the process (i.e., the air/ammonia mixture feed rate) is a particular concern. The Department has determined that control of the air/ammonia feed rate(s) to the process is a necessary part ofNO X RACT for this process. Scrubber: The process off-gas treatment system incorporates a single stage packed tower scrubber which uses KOH as ascrubbing liquor. In the scrubber the KOH effectively reactswith the residual NO X in the exhaust stream to form KNO2 and KNO3. Note that the use of KOH as a scrubber liquor in this process overcomes the problem of disposal of the alkali nitric salts that other facilities might experience using thistechnology, since the liquor is used as feed for the nextbatch. The Department has determined that operation of the KOH scrubber, to include monitoring and control of thefree alkalinity in the scrubber liquor is a necessary part ofNO X RACT for this process. As indicated above, the Department has determined that both the control of air/ammonia feed rate(s) to the processand the operation of a single stage packed tower scrubberwhich uses KOH as a scrubbing liquor constitute NO X RACT for this process.GENERAL NOTICES DELAWARE REGISTER OF REGULATIONS, VOL. 3, ISSUE 12, THURSDAY, JUNE 1, 20001761 RACT Applicable Requirements Operational Limits A.
