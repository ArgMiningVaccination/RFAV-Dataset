Where Does Lead Poisoning Come From? There are a number of possible sources of lead in the environment: LEAD BASED PAINT - A common source of high-dose lead exposure to young children is deteriorating paint found in older homes and buildings. - Paint with a high lead content was used in millions of U.S. homes before 1978. - It was also used on some toys and furniture. DUST AND SOIL - Paint in good condition is usually not a hazard, except in places where painted surfaces rub against each other and creates dust. - These areas are windows and windowsills, doors and door frames, stairs, banisters and railings, and porches and fences. - Soil is contaminated by exterior lead paint chips and dust, lead-based insect sprays, highway pollution and remodeling projects. DRINKING WATER - Lead is usually not found in well or city water. - The water picks up the lead from inside your house. - Lead pipes, plumbing fittings made out of brass or bronze or lead solder used to connect plumbing can contaminate the water. AIR - Air may be contaminated from dust caused by sanding, scraping or burning during removal of lead based paint. - Also lead contamination may occur from living near a manufacturing plant such as a lead smelter. FOOD - Some imported canned food cans may contain lead seams. - Food stored in lead crystal or food that is baked, served or stored in pottery or ceramic with a lead glaze can transfer lead into the food. - Food grown in soil that contains lead may become contaminated. Lead dust from your hands can transfer lead to the foods that you are preparing. HOBBIES AND OCCUPATIONS - Dust and fumes from hobbies (such as stained-glass production, reload ammunition, pottery, refinishing furniture, making fishing weights, jewelry, etc.) can be a source of lead poisoning. - Workers may bring lead-contaminated dust home or in their car, on their clothing, shoes or other work related objects. TRADITIONAL MEDICINES - Greta - Azarcon - Paylooah - Surma - Moonshine - Kohl are traditional folk medicines that contain high levels of lead. VINYL MINIBLINDS - Miniblinds manufactured outside of the U.S. before 1996 may contain lead as a stabilizing agent. - As these blinds are exposed to the sun, the vinyl deteriorates causing lead-contaminated dust to accumulate on the surface.
