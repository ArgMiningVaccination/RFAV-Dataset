The study utilized the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS; Goodin, 2010) to measure medical students' perceptions of the health care reform. Measurement modeling of the HCRTS instrument resulted in a 3-factor solution with a marginal fit, 2(776) = 3,177.835, p < .001, CFI = .898, TLI = .893, RMSEA = .065, and SRMR = .052. The subscales of the instrument included Outlook (the extent of negativity toward the reform), Reaction (the degree to which medical students intend to modify their goals with respect to the reform), and Uncertainty (the perceived stability of the reform and its future). Students in Year 3 had more Role Ambiguity than students in all other years. In particular, they had a significant mean difference of 0.252 ( p < .001) with Year 1, the control variable for Year. Reaction had a significant association with Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy ( b* = 0.241, p < .001 and b* = -0.247, p < .001, respectively). Both Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy were found to be significantly associated with Specialty Commitment ( b* = -0.160, p < .001 and b* = 0.128, p < .001, respectively). Finally, in the structural equation model, all predictors (Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, Year, Self-efficacy, and Role Ambiguity) were found to explain 29.1% of the variance in Specialty Commitment ( p < .001). Findings suggest that the HCRTS be a continued resource in measuring the health care perceptions of medical students and other populations in modified form. Implications of the research findings are that medical student commitment to the ir career goals is affected by their perceptions of the health reform. Medical education must consider the impact of the reform in order to support the needs of medical students and public medical needs within the changing health care landscape. 1 CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION A Short History of Medicine 2000 B.C. - \"Here, eat this root.\" 1000 B.C. - \"That root is heathen, say this prayer.\" 1850 A.D. - \"That prayer is superstition, drink this potion.\" 1940 A.D. - \"That potion is snake oil, swallow this pill.\" 1985 A.D. - \"That pill is ineffective, take this antibiotic.\" 2000 A.D. - \"That antibiotic is artificial. Here, eat this root.\" ~Author Unknown (World of Quotes, 2011, p. 1) The quote above, \"A Short History of Medicine ,\" comically portrays the inherent changing nature of medicine over time. For the last thirty years, I have had a front row seat to watch this slow evolution. My father is a physician. He spent most of my childhood at a hospital or office \"doctoring.\" I rem ember on occasion walking down the long white halls as a young boy strapped to my father's hand as he greeted nurses and physicians and I stared at the scenic paintings plastered on the stucco wall in orderly fashion. I was proud of my dad - that he was so intelligent - that people respected him - that he had saved lives. I worshipped him like a superhero sans cape. Now I am thirty-three and Dad is retired - no longer practicing the profession he loved. He stays current on medicine, so I still ask him questions about new medicines or techniques, health worries, exercise programs, and the like. For all my life, he has been a wealth of knowledge. In my youth, I had a medical expert sitting in my living room talking with me almost every night. Some people may go their whole lives without ever speaking to a physician. President Obama signed a law in 2010 that would provide 35 million people with the opportunity to speak to a physician (Condon, 2010; Pear & Herszenhorn, 2010). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), at this time in the summer of 2013, has survived hopes of repeal by its opposition (Golub, 2011). For my part, I appreciate many, not all, of the ideas proposed by the law, but have neither the political enlightenment nor legal expertise that would allow me to even form an intelligent opinion that is not based on party lines or media speculation. Like most of the 2 country, I am waiting for the uncertainty to dissipate as the pieces of the law continue to take effect. The ACA was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, marking what one leading politician hailed as the \"Civil Rights Act of the 21st century\" (New York Times, 2010, p. 1), despite a divisive vote of 219-212 (with 34 Democrats joining the opposing Republicans; Huffington Post, 2010). The ACA is arguably one of the most significant laws passed in the United States during the past one hundred years (American Medical Association, 2011; American Osteopathic Association, 2011; Tumulty, 2010; Zengerle & Smith, 2010). Among a multitude of stipulations, the main provisions of the law are to insure 35 million previously uninsured citizens, reconstitute businesses' responsibilities for employee medical insurance, erode discrimination toward pre-existing conditions, and alter the Medicare system (Jackson & Nolen, 2010). Specifically, the insuring of 35 million previously-uninsured individuals, called the individual mandate, involves a regulation whereby all United States citizens must carry health insurance, much like drivers are required to carry defensive auto insurance (Jackson & Nolen, 2010). Failure to carry health insurance will result in a fee. Regulations on business es with 50 or more full-time employees, called the business mandate, require that the businesses provide comprehensive insurance to all their employees or pay fees for failure to do so. The pre-existing condition clause, as it's called, stipulates that health insurance companies must insure any applicant regardless of pre-existing conditions (e.g., heart condition). Finally, changes in the Medicare system include \"freezing\" and sometimes reducing the reimbursement of Medicare providers (doctors and hospitals), bundling costs for physician, hospital, and post-acute services, increased screening of and anti-fraud investigation of Medicare providers, provision of brand- name prescriptions for the co-pay cost of generic alternatives, and elimination of co-payment altogether in specific circumstances. The ACA took partial effect immediately and is set to be in full-force by 2014 (Appleby & Steadman, 2010). However, the majority of the states, alongside a multitude of organizations and individuals filed challenges in federal court against the constitutionality of the ACA (Lambert, 2011). Nevertheless, as of January 2012, the courts had upheld the ACA except for one of the four courts that determined the individual mandate clause to be unconstitutional (House Resolution [H.R.] 76, 2011; Kendall, 2011). Beginning in March 2012, the Supreme 3 Court reviewed the suits (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2012) and upheld the majority of the ACA as constitutional. Still, the future of the ACA's existence and characteristic stability remains to be seen, though the reform has already begun to change the health care landscape. Many parts of the ACA have already been enacted and welcomed by the majority of the public. One of the most popular provisions has been allowing young adults to remain on their parents' policies until they reach age 26 (United States Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2012). The DHHS estimated that 2,500,000 young adults from a broad spectrum of ethnicities have benefited from the provision. Another popular provision of the ACA is referred to as the \"donut hole\" provision. Essentially, the ACA has begun decreasing the cost of prescription drugs to Medicare recipients to manageable amounts (Blum, 2010). As of 2011, enrollees began receiving certain brand-name drugs at half price and a seven percent discount on generic drugs when in the coverage gap, during which time enrollees were responsible for the full cost of their prescriptions (DHHS, 2012). Over four million enrollees have already received cost relief due to the \"donut hole\" provision of the ACA. Another example of a popular provision of the ACA is the provision of coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, who might otherwise be refused insurance coverage (DHHS, 2012). Throughout the United States, 62,482 citizens who might otherwise be refused coverage were enrolled and covered in April, 2012. It should be noted that the full extent of the provision is predicted to take place in 2014, as with the majority of ACA provisions. Such provisions, among others, popular or not, have already changed the landscape of health care in the United States. For the purposes of the current study, the ACA and associated changes to the United States health care system were referred to as the Health Care Reform (HCR). In 2010 when the ACA was signed into law, I passed the Florida State University College of Medicine (FSU COM) across the street from the College of Education at Florida State University and wondered how the medical students felt about the HCR. For years, I have been interested in ' traditional' critical life events (CLEs) such as 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina (e.g., Goodin, 2008). In short, a CLE is an event that affects one or more individuals by interrupting and sometimes altering their expected life course. I began to wonder to what extent the H CR could serve as a nontraditional CLE for those planning their lives around the medical profession. 4 Perhaps, for some medical students, the HCR creates no positive or negative reaction. In such case, the HCR is not a CLE for those individuals. For others, the HCR may elicit positive excitement, neutral anxiety, or even apprehension or fear, among a multitude of possible reactions, some of which may be conflicting. Background Health Care Reform in 2013 Health care in the United States is in a state of flux. Therefore, medical education in 2013 may be better understood by the inclusion of discussion of the possible ramifications of the ACA of 2010 (i.e., HCR). A concern of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is that the influx of new patients may exacerbate the already limited supply of health care providers (AAMC, 2010a; AAMC, 2012a; Verilli, 2010). Whereas an uninsured person might normally ignore a strange pain in the ankle, becoming insured by the HCR should hypothetically increase the likelihood that he/she will seek an evaluation from a physician. Primary Care physicians (PCPs), the gatekeepers of the current U.S. health care system, represent a category of medical specializations that is normally considered to include family doctoring, internal medicine, and pediatrics (American Association of Family Physicians, 2010). With the current deficit of PCPs (an approximate deficit of 33%), Primary Care growth becomes an issue as the U.S. prepares to accommodate even more insured individuals (AAMC, 2012a; Halsey, 2009). Medical students may or may not heed the call to fill the need for PCPs. Drew Hudson of the National Physicians' Alliance (NPA; Hudson, 2011) discussed the implications of the ACA for those who will be practicing medicine in the changing health care system, painting an optimistic future for physicians. First, Hudson alleged that doctors will have more autonomy over patient decisions and increased certainty of payment. Secondly, doctors should have increased financial stability, especially those practicing in rural communities or providing primary care services. Thirdly, doctors may benefit from less insurance paperwork and bureaucracy and increased support from electronic medical records and coordinated care (e.g., medical team organizations). Finally, incentives for doctors to enter primary care specialties include funding for scholarships, tax relief, and loan repayments for PCPs and nurses working in underserved areas. In addition, rural health care professionals will benefit from increased payments. 5 Other studies and sources suggested a more cautious outlook on the ACA's future implications for physicians. Most discussion focused on the need to increase the PCP workforce. One provision of the ACA has been to restructure Medicare reimbursements for PCPs. Charles Fiegl, a journalist for the American Medical News (2012), published by the American Medical Association (AMA), explained that physicians everywhere have been questioning whether to continue participating in Medicare due to cuts in Medicare reimbursement. Medicare and Medicaid patients make up approximately 20% of the patient volume for PCPs, but the cost of caring for them is often larger than the payment to the PCP. Congress created a temporary 10% bonus for PCP services to Medicaid in part to narrow the income gap between PCPs and specialists (DHHS, 2012). However, according to Dr. Glen Stream, President of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the temporary increase will not be enough to curtail future workforce shortages (Fiegl, 2012). While some physician s deemed to be PCPs in rural communities have benefited from 10% bonuses on payments, others contend that the bonuses have not made a sufficient impact, noting that the incentives are temporary. Concerned physicians cite the incentives as a step in the right direction, but deem them incapable of solving the major, systemic problems such as some geographically-oriented workforce shortages and the ever-widening payment disparities between PCPs and specialists (Fiegl, 2012). Furthermore, Dr. David Bronson, President of the American College of Physicians, suggested that the temporary nature of the incentives does not allow physicians to make long-term growth plans. Bronson and his organization advocate to make the 10% increase permanent, while adding additional incentives to improve Medicare for PCPs. A recent study by Reschovsky, Ghosh, Stewart, and Chollet of the Commonwealth Fund (2012) found that increasing primary care compensation by 10% for the next decade would result in a 17% increase in PCP visits per patient, but would lead to a net Medicare cost decline of 2% over the next 10 years. The increase should draw more PCPs into the depleted workforce and allow PCPs to use extra funds to hire nurse practitioners and physician assistants for more efficient workflow. Overall, income of PCPs would increase by 8.8% with a permanent increase of 10%. Emphasizing the practicality of improving PCP supply, a study by Chang, Stukel, Flood, and Goodman (2011) on Medicare beneficiary outcomes found that individuals experienced 6 lower mortality rates and fewer hospital visits in areas where there were higher numbers of PCPs and had improved outcomes where the volume of primary care services provided was higher. The study emphasized the linkage of the positive outcomes to a general focus on primary care. Fiegl (2012) reported that a similar boost to PCPs will come from Medicaid in 2013 and 2014 with similar criteria as the Medicare \"bonus.\" Other measures help stimulate growth among PCPs. Annual wellness visits to a PCP are free to the patient, but increase volume for PCPs. Yet, another report by Glendinning (2012) suggested that the dismal view of Medicare's long-term financing may be overly optimistic. Medicare's future relies heavily on reduced payments and assumptions of increased efficiency of care that may not be realistic. Rather than the 1% decrease in spending from 5.9% to 4.9% during the next five years stipulated by Part B of the ACA, Medicare trustees believe that Congress will continue to override the standard growth rate (SGR) cut, leading to a spending growth of up to 7.6%. Should Congress not override the SGR, physicians pay would be squeezed by lower reimbursements and a 2% deficit reduction measure that was set to begin in 2013. The Medicare trustees call ed the ACA a \"wild card,\" since it relies on health professionals to accomplish unprecedented, somewhat improbable improvements in the efficiency of care (Glendinning, 2012). The ACA stipulation for 2019 will restrict physician pay when total Medicare spending exceeds predetermined targets, but spending growth would only decrease 0.1%. Medicare trustees expect future Medicare costs to substantially exceed the current law (i.e., ACA) projections, such that Medicare spending could be 10% of the U.S. economy in 2080 rather than the projection of less than 7%. Both sides of the provider coin (i.e., Medicare trustees and physicians) are dissatisfied with the projected future of the ACA arrangement surrounding Medicare. Dr. Steven Stack, AMA Chair-elect (Glendinning, 2012) stated that without congressional intervention against the ACA to provide a permanent SGR solution, physicians will face a 30.9% loss of revenue from Medicare patients. For many physicians, this could mean denying service to Medicare patients. Stack emphasized the critical need for Medicare recipients to be able to access appropriate care. Whereas Medicare Part B is replenished by funds from both premium and taxpayer resources, should Part A become insolvent, there may be insufficient revenue to supply the promised benefits to seniors (Glendinning, 2012). The possible insolvency is predicted for 2024, but is an optimistic projection. The Obama administration, however, estimated short-term 7 savings of $200 billion to Medicare from ACA provisions through 2016. The government asserts that implementing the ACA fully and effectively is the answer to Medicare fears. The ACA would strengthen Medicare by paying doctors and hospitals based on quality, reducing subsidies for federal drug companies, and increasing premiums for wealthy seniors. Some Republicans have publically disagreed, asserting that Medicare savings projected to fund the ACA in other areas are unrealistic and may lead to the decline of Medicare altogether. The HCR was a key issue in the Presidential Election of 2012. Berry (2012) of the AMA surveyed young doctors (i.e., younger than 40 years of age) about their satisfaction with their practice and their optimism about the future of the U.S. health care system. With regard to their practice, 80% were \"highly satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied.\" Over half (52%) planned to continue their practice for at least eight more years. However, with regard to their perceptions of the future of health care in the U.S., 57% were pessimistic. An additional 21% were optimistic\" and 4% were \"highly optimistic.\" Of the 500 participants in the study, 250 were PCPs, 175 were office-based specialists, and 75 were hospital-based specialists. In response to the survey's findings, Dr. Lou Goodman, president of The Physicians Foundation, was quoted by Berry (2012) to say the level of pessimism is \"very troubling. It's a reflection of the huge debt level they face, uncertainty about the future and the lack of opportunities they see to practice the way they want to practice \u2014 to take care of patients and get the business side out of it\" (Berry, 2012, p. 2). Goodman attributed the surprising amount of pessimism to expectations not being met. Many of Berry's survey respondents felt that the government was to blame for a faulty design in the health care system. In open response, 34% of participants attributed their pessimism to \"the new health care law or regulations.\" An additional 4% said they did not trust the government to \"do the right thing,\" while another 4% said \"patient care may suffer due to government intervention.\" \"Medicare is a mess,\" specifically, was cited as the reason for 2% of the respondents' pessimism. A physician still in residency explained, \"For physicians who are about to enter what we call the real world, there's a lot of trepidation. We still want to help people \u2014 the outlook on that is good. But the practice of medicine is getting more onerous\" (p. 3). The emphasis of the ACA on Medicare may alter medical student perceptions of PCP specializations in comparison to non-PCP specializations. Although some forecasts indicate that 8 PCPs will have a more stable, profitable future, other projections are not as optimistic (Glendinning, 2012). Some other specialties (e.g., general surgery) have sought to become lumped among PCPs to benefit from the ACA incentives, but have not met the criteria. Many medical students reported pessimism about the future of health reform (Goodin, 2010). The current study sought to understand how the perceptions of medical students toward the ACA were similar or different, and to what extent. Additionally, the study aimed to measure differences among medical students who vary in their perception of the HCR in terms of their commitment to their medical degree and their most likely specialty choice. For the purposes of the current study, the term Commitment was defined as the degree to which a medical student was likely to complete the relevant medical goal. The HCR was predicted to have a great effect on medical students. Both as citizens and future practitioners, medical students reported uncertainty as to how the HCR will manifest in the future (Blase, Hederman, & Winfree, 2010; Goodin, 2010). Whereas many laws may be vague, the political and media attention to the ACA brought it under greater scrutiny (Boulton, 2010). The legislation is two pieces amounting to over 2,000 pages of legalese, the bulk of which few have read and even fewer understand (Katz, 2009). The uncertainty about the law affected many citizens as evidenced in some of the shift toward conservative politics in the mid-term elections of 2010 (Cost, 2010; Zogby, 2010). As future medical practitioners, some medical students have braced for possible negative effects, which they fear may result from the HCR (Newman, 2010). Some medical students are aware of the struggle of current medical doctors under decreased Medicare reimbursements (Manos, 2010), at times resulting in prematur e retirements by the physicians themselves (Miller & Thrall, 2010), refusal of services to Medicare patients (Wolf, 2010), or minimization of staff sizes (i.e., firing non-crucial staff; Mataconis, 2010). It should be emphasized that the HCR has not come to full fruition, and will not until 2014. A change in medical students' future career structure may affect them positively or negatively. Perhaps, the future will provide more certainty about what the law is and is not, as well as the effectiveness of its specific stipulations. In the current study, medical students were believed to experience feelings of uncertainty of not knowing yet how or even if the law will change things for them in the future. In their daily roles as medical students, uncertainty may have a more immediate effect on medical students' success in their endeavors or Commitment to their medical career goals. For 9 the purpose of the current study, only two primary operationalizations of Commitment to medical career goals of medical students were discussed. First, some of the potential uncertainty caused by the HCR may have an effect on their Commitment to the medical degree. For example, some students may feel less certain about the career path they have chosen. Secondly, the HCR may affect the medical students' specialization choices. An important responsibility in the role of medical student is to choose more specifically what type of doctor (i.e., specialization) each wishes to become. Although the extent to which the HCR will affect specialty characteristics (e.g., autonomy) is unknown prior to the law's full instantiation (2014), the students' degree of uncertainty about the law affecting (or not) potential specialties is a viable empirical question that was hypothesized to be associated with their perceptions about the attractiveness of specialties. In 2002, Bland and Isaacs found that students are likely to avoid medical specialties that they perceive as less stable. In other words, the researchers suggested that medical students avoid specialties in which they perceive less control over their outcomes. The degree to which students feel uncertainty, or ambiguity, within their role as a medical student is called Role Ambiguity (RA; Rizzo, House, & Lirtzman, 1970). Its effects can be associated with two outcome measures. In the current study, Commitment to medical goals was measured in two strategic ways with regard to the operationalizations of Commitment described above. Generally, a measure of medical students' Commitment to the general goal of becoming a medical doctor (i.e., earning the M.D. degree) provides a long-term future-oriented, career- contextualized understanding of medical students' comfort with the HCR. Additionally, a measure of medical students' degree of Commitment to their specialty opportunities provides a more focused, present-oriented understanding of distinct changes in their specialty plans. The current study measured, generally, variability in Commitment to students' career choice to pursue the medical degree, but emphasized the more specific, possible effects on medical students' degree of Commitment to medical specialties. Therefore, the focus of the literature review in Chapter Two was to analyze theory, theoretical concepts, and predictor variables with discussion of commitment to medical goals as an outcome consideration. Medical students have great latitude in deciding the specialties for which they will compete. Choosing a specialty such as plastic surgery may involve a much greater competition for interested medical students, as there is less availability in residency positions and more money and prestige to be gained (AAMC, 2009). Medical students must be confident in the tasks 10 of medical school, one of which is showing the aptitude and capability to perform above the competition in the specialty of their choice in order to secure their preferred residency placement. Bandura (1977a) coined the term Self-effica cy (SE) to describe confidence toward specific, future goals. For example, a medical student with an outstanding United States Medical Licensure Exam - One (USMLE-1) score, a high GPA, and glowing letters of recommendation from prominent medical educators would be more likely to hold higher SE beliefs about obtaining their chosen specialty. Less apt students may feel less efficacious about the more competitive specialties like plastic surgery. Instead, they may choose specialties that have greater need for physicians and less competition (e.g., family practice), such that they can feel greater self-efficacy toward obtaining their revised specialty of preference. Demographics, specifically Year , may play a role in medical students' commitment to their career goals. According to the Matriculant Student Questionnaire (AAMC, 2011a), most matriculating medical students in 2010 were aged 23-25, which is slightly older than the matriculating students of 2009. The AAMC (2011b) reported that the majority of medical students were Caucasian, Asian, or African American. The students' Year in medical school is likely to influence medical students' future- oriented thinking and present goals (Goodin, 2010). Although not assumed, it is logical to expect first year (Y1) students to think less about future goals, but more about the ir daily roles until such roles have reached a level of automaticity. Students in later years of school are likely to have had time and experience to understand their roles to a greater extent. With regard to medical students' degrees of Specialty Commitment, medical students have increased pressure to more fully commit to an increasingly shorter list of specialties as they progress through school (Paiva, Vu, & Verhulst, 1982). For example, a Y1 medical student may be slightly committed to about 10 different specialties, but a Y3 medical student, due to the need to solidify their decision of specialty choice may only have one or two specialties to which he or she is very highly committed. Despite the pressure on medical students to finalize a specialty choice by the end of their third year, many uncontrollable factors (e.g., position availability) in the fourth year and during post-graduate years (e.g., PGY1), commonly referred to as residencies, play a role in their options and their ultimate decisions. 11 The Health Care Reform as a Critical Life Event In order to understand medical students' perceptions of the HCR at this time in the process of its emergence, the current study conceptualized the passage and implementation of the HCR as a neutral critical life event (CLE). A CLE is often, but not always, a negative event that disrupts the normal course of human life and progress, causing blockage or delay of goals such that those affected by the CLE must reevaluate the situation, the amount of disruption that the event caused, the likelihood of continuing striving for their current goals, and the resources that they can use to combat any imbalance that may have been caused by the event. For many medical students, the HCR may have disrupted expectations (e.g., what \"being a physician\" may entail), the normal flow of their lives, and progression toward their goals, causing reevaluation of current goal paths (e.g., \"Do I still want to continue?\") and examination of resources to continue or change course (e.g., \"Do I have too much student debt to quit?\"). By fra ming the HCR within the conceptual framework of a CLE, the current study sought to provide an understanding of the extent to which the HCR is affecting medical students' choice of future medical specialty as they progress through their medical education. Furthermore, choice of medical specialty is only one of many possible indicators of student adjustment to the HCR. The Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS), a 45-item instrument developed by Goodin (2010) measures the perceptions of medical students about the HCR. Framing the HCR as a CLE, the HCRTS asks medical students to rate their agreement with statements about the HCR that are pertinent to medical students, their educational goals, and, ultimately, their career path. As shown in the first research question, Goodin's (2010) exploratory factor analysis on the HCRTS proposed four subscales ( Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, and Outlook ), but had not yet had its factor structure confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Research Questions The current research aim ed to understand medical students' perceptions of the HCR as a possible CLE in their life course. To this end, the following research questions were proposed to guide the current research: 12 Critical Life Event Reactance Reactance Meaning- making Uncertainty Outlook1. Is the hypothesized factor structure (e.g., Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, and Outlook) of the HCRTS consistent with the data? Figure 1 illustrates Goodin's (2010) 4-factor structure that was under review in Question 1. Figure 1. Goodin's (2010) Factor Structure of the HCRTS The proposed model (see Figure 2) for Questions 2 through 5 assumed that the factor structure depicted in Figure 1 would be supported by the data. Model paths that had hypotheses associated with them are designated by a bold line, while other paths were represented by light lines. 2. What is the percentage of the variance in Role Ambiguity explained by Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, Outlook, and Year? 3. What is the percentage of the variance in Self-efficacy explained by Reactance, Meaning-making, Certainty, Outlook, and Year? 4. What is the percentage of the variance in Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy? 5. What is the percentage of the variance in Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables? 13 Figure 2. Proposed SEM Model Study Rationale There are three primary reasons it was important to conduct the current study within medical education. First, the literature on medical education is limited with regard to understanding of medical education from an educational psychology viewpoint. Medical schools (schools and colleges of medicine) are educational institutions just as are K-12 public school systems, undergraduate systems, and graduate school systems, and are, therefore, amenable to the same analytical lens of educational psychology theories and concepts. Secondly, educational psychology may be able to provide important understanding of the reasons that medical students choose one specialty above another. The great need for PCPs calls for attention to any possible solution to the deficit. By analyzing medical students' Year in 14 medical school and perceptions of CLEs (i.e., the health care reform), educational psychologists can increase understanding of how medical students at different points in their education are reacting to the HCR. Thirdly, medical education is currently in a state of fluctuation due to the HCR. Many medical educators and individuals from the media are attending to the effect of the HCR on the general public, on physicians, and on business. However, little attention is being given to the effects of the law on those currently in training to become medical professionals (e.g., medical students). Changes in health care may inhibit or alter medical students' degrees of commitment to medical goals. Earley (1985; 1986) found that knowledge and information on how to reach a goal increased goal commitment. If the HCR changes a medical student's specialty goal (e.g., family doctor) in ways that decrease the knowledge and information needed for success, the student's degree of commitment toward the goal (e.g., specialty) is likely to decrease. In other words, should events such as the HCR present obstruction or change in the goal process or evaluation of the final goal object (e.g., becoming a family doctor), goal commitment may be correspondingly inhibited. The Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS) includes items to obtain medical students' responses to a number of variables hypothesized to predict medical students' attitudes toward the HCR. The timing of the HCRTS administration was critical in that it survey ed medical students after the Health Care Reform Bill of 2010 was signed into law but during the 2012 Presidential election. In this way, the HCRTS captured critical data about medical students' feelings and thoughts while the HCR was at an increased level of focus. Significance of the Study The fundamental goal of the current study was to understand the extent to which medical students' perceptions of the HCR influence their medical career choices. With the HCR creating uncertainty and pressure amidst an already understaffed health care system, understanding events and factors that influence medical students' progress is imperative. By investigating medical students' perceptions of the HCR across the four years of medical school, the current study assists medical educators in understanding factors (e.g., the HCR) that may influence medical students' degrees of commitment. With this knowledge, medical educators can better identify and act on opportunities to advise medical students in the direction of their medical goals. 15 Finally, understanding the effects of the HCR on medical students should help medical educators understand the influence of a CLE (i.e., the HCR) on the medical education system and potential changes in individual medical students' degrees of commitment. By adding knowledge and understanding of the HCR's influence on medical students, medical educators can better predict and alter their methods of instruction and counsel to protect and encourage their students within a changing health care framework (Carrier, 2010). 16 CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF LITERATURE In order to understand the dynamics of medical students' perceptions toward the health care reform (HCR), a potential Critical Life Event (CLE), one must first understand key variables that affect the \"normal\" progression of the medical student through the four years of medical school. To first ascertain the baseline degree of medical students' comfort, or peace, within their educational lives, Chapter Two begins with a description of a \"normal\" medical student's educational experience: (1) Deciding to become a physician, (2) Admission to medical school, (3) Evolution of medical specialty commitments, and (4) Resilience as a medical student. The major life crises that medical students sometimes endure are examples of CLEs as described by Inglehart (1991), although the current study emphasizes only the health care reform (HCR) as a potential CLE. Chapter Two describes how the HCR can be viewed as a CLE. Through application of CLE Theory as described by Inglehart (1991), a medical student's reaction to an HCR is described in terms of arousal of tension (Selye, 1956), appraisal of reaction possibilities (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), the impact of initial expectations (Wortman & Brehm, 1975), and degrees of commitment to current goals (Klinger, 1975), with the hypothesis that perception of the HCR might affect medical students' degree of Commitment to medical career goals. Next, choosing a specialty is discussed in the framework of Goal-setting Theory (Locke, 1968), emphasizing, specifically, goal commitment (Hollenbeck, 1979) and situational constraints (e.g., HCR; Locke & Latham, 1984). In addition to discussion of the HCR as a possible influence on degree of medical goal commitments, Chapter Two describes two relevant variables, Self-efficacy (SE) and Role Ambiguity (RA), which potentially have predictive power for degrees of Commitment to medical goals. Whereas SE describes medical students' confidence about performing their daily and future tasks (e.g., choosing a medical specialty), RA can describe the uncertainty that an event such as the HCR might have on a medical students' certainty about their daily goals and responsibilities. A review of Goodin (2010) provided support for the current study's usage of the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS) to determine if and to what extent (a) medical students 17 are reacting to the HCR, (b) medical student reactions to the HCR affect their SE and/or RA, and (c) medical student reactions to the HCR predict their Commitment to their medical degree paths and, more specifically, their medical specialties. Finally, the current chapter presents research questions, with relevant hypotheses, to ascertain associations between the variables. A Description of the Medical Student's Educational Experience For the purposes of the current study, a description of the medical education process is simplified into the following aforementioned sections: (1) Deciding to become a physician, (2) Admission to medical school, (3) Evolution of medical specialty commitments, and (4) Resilience as a medical student. According to the AAMC's Matriculating Student Questionnaire (MSQ), one out of two entering medical students decided to study medicine before beginning college (AAMC, 2011a). One-fifth of students had decided to become a physician before they entered high school. Twenty-nine percent (29%) made their decision during high school or sometime before college. Another 24% of students decided in their first two years of college. Among juniors in college, only 11% made the decision, and even fewer decided in their senior year of college (4%). Ten percent (10%) made the decision after earning a bachelor's degree and two percent (2%) decided after obtaining an advanced degree. The AAMC (2010b; 2011a) cited several reasons that students decide on a medical career. The strongest influence on deciding to pursue medicine was a health-related work experience. Other influences cited by medical students at matriculation were science courses, the challenge of medicine, parental encouragement/pressure, physician encounters, experience with illness or accident, and meeting with a health professions advisor. Gaining admittance to medical school is often an arduous process. In 2009-2010, 42,742 people applied to M.D.-granting medical schools in the United States averaging 14 applications per individual for a total of 580,304 applications (AAMC, 2011b). Seventy-four percent (74% ; N = 31,063) of the applicants were first-time applicants, an increase of 2.5% from 30,305 in 2009. By the fall of 2010, 19,641 (46%) had been offered acceptance from at least one medical school, although 18,665 (44%) students actually matriculated. The accepted applicants varied widely in Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, undergraduate GPAs, personal characteristics and life experiences, gender, race, and ethnicity. 18 Medical school applicants must be well-prepared to earn acceptance to a reputable medical school. In 2006, the average GPA and MCAT scores were 3.64 and 30.4, respectively, for medical school matriculants (AAMC, 2007; American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, 2011). Overall, medical applicants scaled scores on the MCAT ranged from 3-45 (mean [ M] = 25, standard deviation [ SD] = 6.4; AAMC, 2007), with 45 being the highest score possible. It should be noted that because of a predicted shortage of physicians by the year 2020, the AAMC (2007) issued a call for increased enrollment in medical schools by 30% (above the 2002-2003 level). In 2010-2011, the entering class size of 18,665 students (AAMC, 2011b) had increased 13.2% above the 2002-2003 baseline of 16,448. Only about 3% of medical students do not complete their degrees, according to Garrison, Mikesell, and Matthew (2007 ). Calli (National Resident Matching Program, 2012), of the AAMC, reported that 95.1% of medical students found a post-graduate placement, referred to as a \"match,\" on March 26, 2012, which was the highest match-rate in 30 years. Medical students are trained in different ways throughout the world. The focus of the current study is on the allopathic medical systems in the United States that result in the degree of Doctor of Medicine (i.e., M.D.). The medical profession in the United States involves types of doctors that are referred to as medical specialties. Two main categories of specialties are primary care and non-primary care, which is typically more specialized. Primary care specialties are normally considered to be family practice, pediatrics, and internal medicine (AAMC, 2011a). At times, the medical community may include obstetrics and gynecology as another PCP specialty. There are many more specialties within the non-primary care category. A few examples include surgery, osteopathy, and psychiatry. Goodin (2010) placed greater emphasis on the category of specialty sought than the individual specialty. In order to provide a clearer, more in-depth understanding of medical students' specialty choices, the current study asks medical students about individual specialties and generalizes into categories when appropriate. Chew, Rajakrishnan, Low, Jayapalan, and Sreeramareddy (2011) discussed the specialization process during medical school whereby physicians, who are relatively undifferentiated but generally capable, progress through medical school gaining information about their specialty interests. Once fully committed to a specialty, a medical student begins to focus all of their academic training on one specialized branch of medicine. Although students 19 may remain uncommitted to a singular specialty choice during the first two to three years, most medical students choose a specialty commitment (e.g., plastic surgery) by the end of the third year or early in the fourth year (Held & Zimet, 1975; Senf, Campos-Outcalt, Kutob, 2005; Zeiger, 2004). Chew and his colleagues suggested that knowing about students' preferred choice of specialist training could be useful to society through the actions of national health manpower programs by identifying specialty areas that have an inadequate number of physicians in order to make such specialties more attractive. According to Boulis, Jacobs, and Veloski (2001), over one-third of matriculants enter medical school without a preference for a specific specialty. However, research on those who do indicate an initial specialty preference indicates some diversity of focus. The most popular specialties cited by the AAMC (2011a) are Internal Medicine (17.7%) and Pediatrics (13.7%). Other specialties that are preferred to a lesser degree by beginning medical students are Orthopedic Surgery (8.7%), Emergency Medicine (8.5%), Family initial specialty interests and intentions often change during the medical student's education. In fact, most medical students were undecided when they began medical school or changed specialties at a later time. Boulis et al. emphasized that medical school experiences could potentially influence the specialty choice of most medical students. Individual studies have found a variety of variables that influence specialty choice including student demographics, medical school characteristics, students' perceptions about the specialty, student values (Newton, Grayson, & Whitley, 1998), the impact of higher income, prestige, the impact of hospital-based practice (Gorenflo, Ruffin, & Sheets, 1994), personal intelligence, career opportunities, and socio-environmental factors (Saigal & Rosenbaum, 2007). Multiple studies have consistently noted the influence of academic teaching faculty influence, experience during clerkships, and flexibility of working arrangements on specialty choice (Harris, Gavel, & Young, 2005; Saigal & Rosenbaum, 2007). In a sample of 649 medical students, Newton et al. (1998) found a positive relationship between choice of primary care specialties and student- rated influences such as \"emphasis on people skills, rather than technical skills\" and \"strong emphasis on primary care .\" The demographic characteristic of \"being married\" was also predictive of choosing primary care. The 20 students' perceptions of the importance of \"prestige within the medical profession\" and \"income relative to other spe cialties\" were negatively related to choice of a primary care specialty. In the Chew et al. (2011) recent survey study of specialty choice, the researchers found that the influence of teaching faculty and hospital consultants was the most important personal factor, whereas inspiration during clinical training, the challenge of the student's specialty, and the suitability of the student's personality to the specialty were the most important professional factors. Gorenflo et al. (1994), in a study of US medical students, found no single factor to be particularly dominant in determining students' degree of commitment to primary care specializations, but found that higher degrees of commitment to non-primary care specialization were influenced by higher income, more prestige, and hospital-based practice. Student debt among medical students has become an increasingly influential variable on medical students' persistence and choice of specialization in medical school (Pardes, 2009). If medical students believe that the HCR may affect the availability of school funding and/or the amount of pay in various specialties, they may alter their specialty choice, likely favoring more stable, financially supported specialties. In 2012(b), the AAMC reported that 86% of graduates have educational debt. In a 2006 report (AAMC), medical education debt in 2003 was almost five times that of 1984. The average debt for a medical physician after residency in 1992 was $25,000 (Chang et al., 2011). By 2009, the average debt had increased to $157,990, with 25.1% of students exceeding debt amounts of $200,000 (prior to residency). Among other reasons for medical student debt, the most significant is the extreme increase in tuition costs. In 2006, the AAMC reported that the median medical school tuition and fees had increased substantially for both private and public (i.e., state) medical schools (165% and 312%, respectively) since 1985. The largest tuition increase in history came in 2003 when private and public school tuitions increased by 5.7% and 17.7%, respectively. The AAMC (2012b) remarked on the role of the United States economy in determining student debt. Federal and state budgets have been frozen to some extent, decreasing funding for medical education, especially for public schools. Specific results have included loss of existing scholarships, scholarship opportunities, and increases in tuition that have occurred overall, mid-year, and retroactively in some instances. The extent of influence that student debt has on specialty choice among medic al students is debatable. Pardes (2009) attributed the shortage of PCPs to studen ts' need to alleviate financial 21 debt by finding specialties with greater salaries. In 2008, the Family Medicine Residency match filled only 44% of its available slots with medical students from the United States, less than half of the US representation in 1984 (National Residency Matching Program, 2008). Perhaps student debt and the prestige of specialization play a motivational role even among medical students that are considered PCP. Although there is still, currently, a large deficit in the overall amount of PCPs in the United States, 33.9% of medical school graduates specialized in a PCP specialty (AAMC, 2011c). It seems that students may be going toward the promoted PCP specialties, but 70.3% of those specializing in PCPs plan to subspecialize in thei r respective PCP fields. For example, a pediatrician may choose to subspecialize in pediatric oncology. Those who subspecialize in PCP fields are less likely to serve the general PCP needs of the public. Furthermore, according to the Graduate Questionnaire (AAMC, 2011c), 32.4% of graduating medical students do not plan to become practicing physicians. These individuals plan to work full-time at university doing clinical teaching and research. Those medical students who are focused on PCP, but not planning to become practicing physicians, further decrease the extent to which the dearth of PCP supply is being balanced. Because of the large transition in personality and maturity that takes place from age 18- 25 (Arnett, 2010), the differences in age at which a person officially becomes a medical student may affect their persistence in their original specialty interests and their overall resilience in medical school. This strength of motivation to persist was described by Kusurkar, Kruitwagen, ten Cate, and Croiset (2010) as the extent to which the student is ready to begin and continue their medical training to fruition despite sacrifices, setbacks, or misfortune. For example, in a study of newly admitted medical students, Marley and Carman (1999) found that only half (52%) actually wanted to practice medicine. Others entered due to their interest in biology (19%), parental pressure (13%), and previous high marks in hard sciences (12%). Various researchers have found that beginning medical students are unaware of many of the role responsibilities and conditions of practicing medicine (Marley & Carman, 1999; Underwood, Thompson, & McCaskie, 1990). Nieuwhof, Rademakers, Kuyvenhoven, Soethout, and ten Cate (2005) found that first year medical students' knowledge of the medical profession was limited to basic characteristics and general knowledge. For example, their knowledge was limited to understanding that they would (a) talk to patients, and (b) work in an operating room. Underwood et al. (1990) cited the paucity of knowledge even about career structures and 22 working hours among beginning medical students. Such lack of knowledge concerning the roles, duties, responsibilities, and strategies for success in medical school can be described as RA (Rizzo et al, 1970). Perhaps RA may inhibit or decrease the degree to which medical students commit to a medical specialty. A medical student's role may be confusing at times, especially when challenges arise in addition to normal duties (e.g., HCR). For medical students in the United States, there are rewards in medical education alongside several challenges. In simple terms, challenges are types of stressors that affect students differently on individual bases. Stress resulting from RA is just one potential challenge that medical students may face in their medical education. The complexity and difficulty of the medical student's life is no novel topic. In 1971, Rosenberg called medical educators' attention to the \"double bind\" whereby medical students, inundated by the rigor of medical study, require greater effort and study time. Yet in expending greater effort and study time, they may become sleep deprived or experience burnout. Kutcher (1984) similarly concluded that medical student survival may implicitly require the student to put themselves at emotional and psychological risk for anxiety disorders or the development of unhealthy personality characteristics. Common rewards of medical school include positive interactions with clinicians and patients (McLean, 2004; Williams, Ramani, Fraser, & Orlander, 2008), collaborating with peers (Buddeberg-Fischer & Herta, 2006; Santucci et al., 2008), and formation of a professional identity that will promote their success in their future careers (Boshuizen, King, & Scherpbier, 2007; Lin et al., 2004; Weller, Thwaites, Bhoopatkar, & Hazell, 2010). Alongside many rewarding attributes of medical school, there may be challenges or drawbacks (e.g., stressors) as implied by Rosenberg (1971) that make medical students an emotionally vulnerable population (Morrison & Moffat, 2001). Stress management research with medical students suggests that they are hesitant to seek help, taking more of an ad hoc approach to stress consequences (Caplan, 1994; Chambers, 1992). Unfortunately, experiencing stress and/or crises during medical school may have a severe impact on the individual's quality of life and/or academic performance. Clark and Rieker (1986) discussed the typical life stressors that are not unique to medical school. Like their nonmedical peers, medical students continue to put energy into their relationships with romantic partners, friends, and family members, become pregnant, have children, and contend with physical health and illness. Morrison and Moffat (2001) concluded that the combination of stressors assailing medical students while their coping abilities are 23 compromised makes them an emotionally vulnerable population. Initially, medical student matriculants have similar rates of depression and anxiety as other types of graduate students, but these rates increase disproportionately during medical school (Aktekin et al., 2001). In a commentary, Firth-Cozens (2001) remarked on the extant psychological findings among medical students, stating that medical students are no different (in terms of psychopathology) from the others (e.g., graduate business students), but become much more \"stressed and depressed\" than their counterparts during their first year in school. More recently, a systematic review by Dyrbye et al. (2006) concluded that medical students, when compared to age-matched peers and the general population, had greater degrees of depression, distress, and exhaustion (i.e., burnout). Many research studies have cited the prevalence of psychological illness among medical students (Firth-Cozens, 1989; Okasha, Lotaif, & Sadek, 1981). A longitudinal study of United States medical students by Clark and Zeldow (1988) found that 12% of all medical student participants scored in the clinically significant range for depression based on their results on the Beck Depression Inventory. Pickard, Wittenberg, Comas-Herrera, Davies and Darton (2000) and Ashton and Kamali (1995) found that medical students report increased usage of cannabis and illicit drugs. Overall, research has found that medical students, when compared to their peers, are more likely to abuse or depend on substances (Adshead & Clare, 1986; Webb, Ashton, Kelly, & Kamali, 1998). Furthermore, the medical students' elevated levels of distress threaten their personal well-being and academic performance. For example, studies of medical students suggest that compared to their non-distress ed peers, distressed medical students are less empathic and more likely to burn out (Dyrbye et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2007). In 2000, Newton and colleagues found medical student stress and anxiety to be associated with increased cynicism and decreased empathy (Newton et al., 2000). In addition to normal stressors, crises occur in the lives of medical students just as they do in the lives of all human beings. The HCR, for medical students who perceive it as such, may be one such crisis that is more broadly affecting the population of medical students. Such crises may have a more damaging impact on medical students due to the already immense amount of stress and pressure they may be facing (Greenburg, Durning, Cruess, Cohen, & Jackson, 2010 ; Hojat, Gonnella, Erdmann, & Vogel, 2003). For example, in a qualitative study of medical students, Greenburg et al. (2010) found that 22% of their respondents (N = 394) reported encountering a major life crisis during their medical education. Some examples of major life 24 crises described in the study were a death of a close friend or family member, an unexpected pregnancy, and financial insufficiencies. Major life crises in extant literature are consistent with the criteria for a CLE as previously described (Inglehart, 1991), although the extent to which \"major life crisis\" research can be applied to CLEs in the form of daily hassles and less traumatic critical life events is an empirical question. For medical students perceiving the HCR as a CLE, its effects may be somewhat similar to those reported in the major life crisis literature to follow. Medical students' daily lives and major life crises were described in the following section. Thus, there should be more clarity about any additional effect that the HCR may have on students' progression through medical school toward a specialization choice and career. In order to preserve each author's theoretical orientation, the wording, \"major life crisis, \" was retained in accordance with original wording. According to Greenburg et al. (2010), there is little research into major life crises (e.g., prevalence, causes, and consequences) within the context of medical school. Major life crises do not always arise overtly so that determining their onset and resolution may be difficult. In a study of medical students, Greenburg et al.'s (2010) participants who had experienced a major life crisis (24.3%) believed that it had been detrimental to their performance. Many (25.1%) life crises experienced by medical students were related to relationship stressors, while death of a friend or illness or death of a family member accounted for 46.9% (25.1% and 21.8%, respectively). The importance of the sick or deceased individual to the medical student was predictive of the degree to which performance was affected. Other reported crises included medical and/or psychiatric illnesses (6.9% and 4.6%, respectively). Only one participant in Greenburg et al.'s (2010) sample cited a financially-related crisis. Greenburg et al. (2010) contended that the lack of financial crises among their sample was likely a reflection of the salary and benefits that students in their military-affiliated medical school sample received as commissioned military officers. The impact of a life crisis during medical school can be damaging to both personal well- being and academic success. In the aforementioned Greenburg et al. (2010) study, those medical school graduates who reported having experienced a major life crisis during their medical education career performed significantly worse with respect to USMLE exam scores, performance ratings by their program directors, and basic science GPAs than did graduates who did not experience a crisis. Greenburg et al. (2010) found that a great majority (91.9%) of those 25 medical students who reported experiencing a life crisis during medical school said that it negatively affected their performance in medical school. Greenburg et al.'s (2010) data supported their participants' statements, showing significant adverse effects on annual grades, GPA at graduation, USMLE-1, and USMLE-2 scores. Other reported repercussions significantly predicted by a major life crisis during medical school included Student Promotion Committee evaluation, deceleration, or repetition of an academic year ( p < .001 for a ll; Greenburg et al., 2010). Hence, for medical students who experienced a crisis, graduation was often delayed significantly (4.16 vs. 4.04 years). The effects of the stress and crisis compilation seem to inhibit the future success of medical students as well. Greenburg et al. found that medical students' major life crises had negative repercussions persisting through internship. Compared to those who did not report a major life crisis, medical students who experienced a major life crisis during medical school were evaluated more negatively by program directors in several areas (e.g., overall performance, clinical approach to patients; Greenburg et al., 2010). Unfortunately, as previously stated regarding \"normal\" stressors, the consequences of major life crises can affect professional conduct and empathy for those with chronic illnesses (Dyrbye, Thomas, & Shanafelt, 2005; Gill, Palmer, Mulder, & Wilkinson, 2001). With regard to decreases in professionalism, Dyrbye et al. (2005) noted detrimental effects on students' patient treatment, relationships with faculty, and the medical professional culture. More specifically, a study by Thomas et al. (2007) found burnout and emotional exhaustion were significantly negatively related to empathy, an essential componen t of medical professionalism (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, 2006). Medical Profession in Transition Changes in the traditional role of the United States physician were noted by a number of researchers as early as 2000 (Arnetz, 2001; Castellani & Wear, 2000). These research studies cited a decrease in social status for physicians and an increase in the power of the patient to access their own medical information and medical resources to make more intelligent, personalized medical choices of their own. Even in their own offices, some physicians have lost the autonomy that they once enjoyed (Hojat et al., 2000) by losing authority over nurses and other health care personne l (Gjerberg & Kjolsrud, 2001). In 2000, Castellani and Wear stated that \"physicians find themselves no longer sure about what it means to be a physician or how to adjust to the changes 26 taking place. The old story line of the physician as protagonist, autonomous, powerful, and capable of opposing the system for the benefit of the patient has fallen apart\" (p. 193). The extent to which medical students are aware and/or affected similarly to physicians is an empirical question. For the current study, a possible increase in a \"normal\" level of confusion of daily and future identity is hypothesized to be the result of RA and/or disturbance resulting from the HCR. The AAMC openly discussed the changes resulting from the HCR that will play a part in the supply and demand issues of physicians in the United States (AAMC, 2011b). In response to the projected shortage ( n = 91,500) of physicians, the AAMC cited the need for better and more efficient use of all health care professionals. A collaborative, shared working environment where nurse practitioners work in tandem with physicians is one possibility given to provide more efficiency, increased patient satisfaction, and improve health outcomes (AAMC, 2012a). The AAMC stated, \" Exactly how that will play out is still in the developmental stages\" (2012a, p. 4). Such a statement is indicative of the ambiguity that may be related to perceptions of the HCR for some medical students. Gradual change allows individuals to accommodate and become accustomed to new issues and concerns while developing a new set of strategies to normalize the changes. However, radical changes such as that of Sweden's medical system in the early 21st century may present more quickly, leading to increased disquietude, or reactance (Inglehart, 1991). Given the high baseline stress levels within the medical school context, medical students may be less suited to cope with unanticipated stressors (Greenburg et al., 2010 ; Hojat et al., 2003). During a time of change and financial cutbacks in the Swedish medical profession, Holstr \u00d6m, Sanner, and Rosenqvist (2004) noted the generally pessimistic view of the students about the future of their profession. Although the medical education system in Sweden differs from the system in the United States, the relative similarity between the radical change in the Swedish medical system and the current HCR process in United States medical system could make understanding the Swedish health care change process informative for predicting and understanding the current changes in the United States health care system. In addition to structural differences in the Swedish medical system, the direction of change toward \"capitalistic\" from \"socialistic\" values differed almost counter-directionally to that of the current United States HCR changes. Most Swedish medical students believed that private health care alternatives would improve working conditions and 27 employee satisfaction, providing increased opportunities and higher salaries (Hostr \u00d6m et al., 2004). Medical students reported feelings of being trapped in an emotionally and physically exhausting and overwhelming future working environment. However, amidst burnout and pessimism regarding working conditions in Swedish health care, many students feared endangering the Swedish model of 'equal care for all' as a result of increased private care options (Hostr \u00d6m et al.). Students who had what Inglehart (1991) referred to as reactance to the health care reform in Sweden cited specific fear toward the escalating demands on an already overrun, inadequate system. Considering these concerns, some students reported regret about their professional career choice to become a medical physician, not unlike some United States students' statements regarding the HCR (Goodin, 2010). The Health Care Reform: A Critical Life Event The research on reactions to CLEs constitutes a unique case. It is a topic that has stimulated basic research as well as applied research and one that has been investigated by psychologists from a number of different sub-disciplines. Research on CLEs provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between basic and applied research and to enhance communication between separate areas of psychology (Inglehart, 1991). The Applicability of Critical Life Event Theory Although goals and goal commitment levels are often quite stable over time, goals (Emmons, 1986, 1991) are likely to change dramatically during CLEs (Herman, 1997; Klinger & Cox, 1986; Salmela-Aro, 1992). The current study uses the theoretical premise of a CLE as described by Inglehart (1991) to research medical students' perceptions of the HCR. According to Inglehart's comprehensive analysis of individuals' reactions to CLE's, a CLE is an event that (1) disrupts the norm (evidenced by goal stoppage or alteration), (2) causes disequilibrium (evidenced by tension arousal), and (3) elicits responses (e.g., evidenced by meaning making and/or searching for information) based upon available options, levels of investment, and resources. With the passage of the ACA and beginning of the HCR, factors that predict the commitment to a medical degree (i.e., practice or other) and degree of commitment to specific specialty choices could be altered by an individual's or cohort's reactions to the HCR, thus 28 substantiating the need for controlling or understanding the effects of the HCR on the current dynamic interplay between variables (i.e., year and medical specialty commitment). Simply put, medical students who are more concerned about the effects of the HCR on their current specialty choice(s) may be more likely to alter their commitment to their current specialty and its alternatives. For example, if medical students perceive that primary care specialties are going to be adversely affected by the HCR, they may avoid or decrease further commitment to PCP specialties. Medical students in Y1 are likely to be less committed to a specialty choice and may have less difficulty in changing or avoiding specialty commitments. Using Inglehart's (1991) theoretical description of CLEs, the current research seeks to determine the effects of medical students' differentiated perceptions of the HCR on the degrees of commitment among medical students in different years of medical school. A conceptualization of a critical life event. A traditional view of a CLE is one in which a CLE constitutes a negative, unexpected crisis or disaster (e.g., natural disasters, loss of employment, death of a loved one, serious illness, divorce; Inglehart, 1991). In recent years, researchers have broadened the definition of CLEs to be more inclusive. Such a redefinition enables inclusion of the HCR to be defined as a CLE in the lives of many medical students. Psychologists have studied a wide variety of events regarding their importance and centrality for the person(s) involved in the event. For example, CLE research has focused on natural disasters (Janis & Mann, 1977), war (Grinker & Spiegel, 1945; Kaylor, King & King, 1987), shared crises (e.g., death of a spouse; Stroebe & Stroebe, 1983), personal crises (e.g., life- threatening illness; Taylor, Lichtman, & Wood, 1984), chronic life stress (Pearlin, 1980), and daily hassles (Delongis, Coyne, Dakof, Folkman, & Lazarus, 1982). Psychologists also consider positive and neutral events to be CLEs (Inglehart, 1991). The breadth of life course disruption subsumed by the redefinition of a CLE provides sufficient reason to consider the HCR as a potential CLE for medical students. Theoretical foundations of critical life events. In 1991, Inglehart summarized a vast array of research relevant to her CLE theory that is the prominent theoretical foundation for the current study. Inglehart's theory was the only comprehensive theory of CLEs found during a literature search. The current study emphasizes four response categories to CLEs based on fundamental precursors of a CLE described by Inglehart in order to evaluate the extent to which an event met CLE criteria on an individual (medical student) basis. 29 A great diversity of research into life circumstances and events informed Inglehart's (1991) theoretical conceptualization of a CLE, though most literature did not use the terminology \"Critical Life Event.\" An understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of Inglehart's theory of CLEs is essential in order to identify the components of her theory that are most applicable to medical students and the HCR. The primary theories that informed Inglehart's comprehensive model of CLEs were Selye's (1956) General Adaptation Syndrome, Klinger's (1978) Incentive- Disengagement Theory, Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Theory of Stress and Coping, and Brehm's (1966) Theory of Psychological Reactance. To date, Inglehart's comprehensive model has not been empirically tested. The current study begins to test Inglehart's model. Although most prior research on CLEs is simply descriptive, the descriptions support the concepts of tension arousal, emotional reactions, and differentiated types of reactions (e.g., Turner, Goodin, & Lokey , 2012). Tension can be very pronounced depending on the individual and the CLE. Critical life events usually involve an adjustment in a blocked goal path. Inglehart's theory was informed by the broad diversity of event types that have been researched as interruptions to the normal life cycle. For example, CLE research has greatly emphasized coping with life circumstances. Examples of studies that have focused on coping with a CLE have dealt with adjustment issues such as the health status of oneself or another individual (Bammer & Newberry, 1981; Taylor, Lichtman, & Wood, 1984), interpersonal relations such as divorce or partner loss (Stroebe & Stroebe, 1983), loss of employment (Kasl & Cobb, 1979), job demands (Dobos, 1979), and general events in history (Green, Wilson, & Lindy, 1985; Wilson, Smith, & Johnson, 1985). Other CLE research has sought to understand coping with more traumatic CLE experiences such as criminal acts (e.g., rape, incest, accidents; Bulman & Wortman, 1977 ; Burgess & Holmstrom, 1976, 1978, 1979; Silver, Boon, & Stone, 1983), the experience of war (Grinker & Spiegel 1945; Kaylor, King & King, 1987), natural catastrophes (Cascalar, Cervantes, Dezan, & Gates, 1986; Long & Richard, 1986), immigration or forced resettlement (Rosch, 1985), surviving a concentration camp (Dimsdale, 1980; Frankl, 1985), and experiencing a nuclear catastrophe or other extreme situation (Lifton, 1963). Turner et al. (2012) studied the retrospective perceptions of both \"normal-life\" CLEs (e.g., having a baby) and more traumatic CLEs (e.g., major car accident) among a wide range of 18-55 year olds. In 2008, Goodin specifically focused on the perceived well-being of Hurricane Katrina survivors, using the Critical Life Event Theory as the theoretical framework. Although 30 most CLE research has focused on negative life events (Inglehart, 1991), Inglehart's concept of a CLE included positive, negative, and neutral events, as long as the event created an interruption in the normal life cycle. Selye's (1956) General Adaptation Syndrome. One of the theories that informed Inglehart's (1991) model was Selye's (1956) General Adaptation Syndrome. Selye described the concept of \"stress\" as the discomfort or imbalance that may happen as a result of interruptions to the normal course of life. Selye defined stress (i.e., tension) as \"the nons pecific response of the body to any demand\" (1956, p. 55). Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome proposed an initial alarm reaction to a stressor, the stage of resistance, and the stage of exhaustion. Selye's theory has been supported empirically by research into immune response of such stressed populations as caregivers and students (Graham, Christian, & Kiecold-Glaser, 2006 ; Khansari, Murgo, & Faith, 1990). Inglehart emphasized Selye's discussion of an initial reaction to a stressor, the subjectivity of stress, and the existence of positive stress (\"eustress\") alongside negative stress (\"stress\"). She noted Selye's discussion of an individual's need to regain homeostasis (balance) after the presentation of a stressor in one's life. The arousal of tension, the individualistic nature of what constitutes a CLE for any given person, and the neutrality of stress (i.e., both positive and negative stress; Selye, 1956; Inglehart, 1991) are important criteria to consider when evaluating the HCR as a possible CLE in medical students' lives. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Theory of Stress and Coping. Another theory that informed Inglehart's (1991) theory was Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Theory of Stress and Coping. Lazarus and Folkman contributed the idea of cognitive appraisal with regard to how one reacts to stress, indicating that the same stimulus may affect two individuals differently, or the same person differently at different points in time. Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) Theory of Stress and Coping has been empirically supported by research with married couples. Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, and DeLongis (1986) studied 85 married couples and individuals dealing with stressors. Jacobucci (2000) further supported the theory by researching the way that individuals perceive stressors, while Verduyn, Mechelen, and Tuerlinckx (2011) added theoretical support in their research of factors that determine the emotional experience tied to a stressor. Inglehart (1991) emphasized Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) discussion of uncertain circumstances. In situations where uncertainty is increasing, individuals are likely to increase 31 their information-seeking and decrease their direct actions toward the problem (Lazarus & Launier, 1978). If the uncontrollability of a situation is appraised to be high, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness may ensue. Inglehart (1991) focused on individual differences in reactions to stressors. In order to predict how one might react to a CLE, she focused on Lazarus and Folkman's views about cognitive appraisal of the stressor's relevance and the resources one has with which to react to the stressor. In the current study, the types of reactions to stressors, such as uncertainty, discussed by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) and the amount of information-seeking, specifically, are predicted to be indicators of the degree of felt-uncertainty by medical students' about the HCR's future role in their lives. As previously stated, the imminence (e.g., increased relevance) of the HCR to medical students might be different for those medical students in later years of medical school. Some indication of medical students' cognitive appraisal of the HCR may provide understanding of the factors influencing students to alter their commitment to their current specialty choice. For example, in the current study, items ask students about their perceptions regarding their disruption, outlook, meaning-making, uncertainty, response options, and evaluation of the HCR. Medical students' responses with respect to these issues provides information about their perceptions of the HCR, specifically about students approaching (i.e., increasing commitment to) or avoiding (i.e., decreasing commitment to) specialties the y perceive to be most affected by the HCR. In light of Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) cognitive appraisal of one's resources (e.g., options), medical students in different years of medical education are believed to vary in degrees of uncertainty elicited by the HCR. Veteran (Y3-Y4) students who are likely to have greater student debt than beginning students (Y1-Y2) might appraise their situation as having fewer options (e.g., \"I can't quit now. I have too much debt.\"). Brehm's (1966) Theory of Psychological Reactance. Another theory that informed Inglehart's (1991) theory is Brehm's (1966) Theory of Psychological Reactance. Based on the views espoused by Brehm's (1966) Theory of Psychological Reactance, Wortman and Brehm (1975) discussed reactance to regain control in lieu of complacency and helplessness in reaction to blocked goals. Brehm (1966, 1972) suggested that people have \"reactance,\" such that they would fight back with motivational arousal to regain lost control. The amount of reactance would be determined by the original expectations, the strength of the threat to the expectations, the importance of the goal (which they termed \"freedom\"), and the implications of that goal for their 32 individual lives. Such reactance may lead an individual to a change in perception toward the goal, a direct action toward the goal, or emotional reaction (e.g., anger). They theorized that the greater the importance of the outcome, the stronger the attempts would be to restore the threatened freedom - or the stronger the helplessness effects. Empirical research has supported Brehm's theory among those with physical illness or disability (McDaniel, 1976; Trieschmann, 1978), breast cancer (Meyerowitz, 1980), heart disease (Croog, Levine, & Lurie, 1968; Doehrman, 1977), and grief and bereavement (Schulz, 1978; Vachon et al., 1979). With regard to Brehm's (1966) Theory of Psychological Reactance, Inglehart promoted evaluation of an individual's full array of cognitions, as opposed to event-specific cognitions alone, so that the process of making meaning out of outcomes may be better understood. For instance, by knowing that a person has a large amount of religious thought, a researcher might understand why the person would claim that a CLE was \" God's will.\" In the context of medical students, Brehm's (1966) theory suggests that medical students may have varying degrees of cognition and arousal toward the HCR so that some students may display fewer cognitions and lower arousal toward the possible long-term effects of the HCR. Medical students who are less committed to medical goals are believed to have less HCR arousal and fewer HCR cognitions. Brehm's (1972) emphasis on the role of original expectations may also be an important consideration in determining the varying amounts of HCR arousal in medical students' lives. For example, if a medical student had the original expectation of owning his/her own geriatric medical facility, concerns over the HCR's effects on Medicaid reimbursement could alter or nullify those expectations and, subsequently, decrease commitment to the medical student's goal. If medical students in different medical education years perceive the HCR to be more or less relevant than their peers in other year cohorts, the medical year of the student might then have an increased impact on medical students' reactance to the HCR. It could potentially cause them to attend to a greater number of HCR ramifications (i.e., increased cognitions) and greater extents of their life courses should they perceive the event as more relevant than students in different medical years. Medical students who are in later years of medical school are believed to be more likely to perceive the HCR as a pertinent issue. Also relevant to the current study is Wortman and Brehm's (1975) postulation that when a goal's outcome is uncontrollable, individuals may decrease their perception of the goal's attractiveness. Medical students who feel 33 that their career in health care is less controllable due to the HCR are believed to be less attracted to finishing, and evidence the change in their degree of commitment and level of performance. Klinger's (1975; 1978) Incentive-Disengagement Theory. A final theory that informed Inglehart's (1991) model was Klinger's (1975; 1978) Incentive-Disengagement Theory. Klinger described the individual's process of reacting to tension in the wake of blocked goals and their associated rewards. People commit to the goals (and their rewards) at a normal commitment level. Commitment continues until the goal is reached and the reward is received, or until reevaluation occurs that causes commitment to cease. If the goal is blocked, tension may arise. Klinger hypothesized that the amount of tension that would arise would correlate with the subjective importance of the goal being blocked. Klinger's theory was empirically supported by a study of depressed individuals and students who experienced uncontrollable events (Blaney, 1977; Costello, 1978). With regard to Klinger's (1975) theory, Inglehart (1991) primarily focused on the prediction of the amount of tension that may be elicited by a blocked goal. Klinger's theory may now be relevant to the current study in that the importance of the HCR and the extent to which it blocks individual medical students' goals may elicit varying amounts of tension for medical students. Collectively, CLE Theory purports that when an individual faces a CLE, he or she is likely to: (a) experience the arousal of tension to an individually unique degree, regardless of the positive or negative perception of the event (Selye, 1956); (b) appraise the event in order to ascertain the most effective reaction, such as gathering information in order to dissipate perceived uncertainty (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984); (c) think and become activated (arousal of tension) to varying degrees based largely on original expectations each individual holds regarding their goal paths, sometimes leading to the decreased attractiveness of goals that are blocked by the event (Wortman & Brehm, 1975); and (d) maintain or decrease the degree to which they are committed to the goals blocked or altered by the event and the degree to which they feel discomfort from said blockage (Klinger, 1975). Thus, medical students could experience different levels of concern toward the HCR or its specific aspects, question, and possibly change their degrees of medical goal commitments (e.g., to specialties of interest), determine the most effective reaction (e.g., gather information), and begin to react to the HCR 34 based on the degree to which it has altered their original expectations regarding their career as a doctor and/or practicing specific specialties. Medical Education as a Goal-Striving Process Locke's (1968) Goal-setting Theory stipulated that goals are conscious cognitive processes that are the primary determinants of behavior, and, thus, integral to motivation. Wood and Locke (1990; Locke & Latham, 2002) pointed out that goals indirectly affect action (i.e., performance) through discovery, arousal, and/or use of goal-relevant and strategies and knowledge. Goals are directive, in that they direct attention and effort toward activities that ar e relevant to goal completion (Locke & Bryan, 1969; Rothkopf & Billington, 1979). Thus, goal- setting processes (e.g., specificity) of students in different years are thought to potentially play a role in different perceptions of the HCR. For example, students in their final years (Y3 & Y4) of medical school are more likely than their \"younger\" counterparts to have a more limited selection of specialties to which they are committed. Essentially, the current study tests aspects of Goal-setting Theory as they relate to the other variables of the study. The abundance and variety of research on Goal-setting Theory supports its validity and practicality with regard to explaining motivation (Lee & Earley, 1992; Locke, 1995; Mento, Steel, & Karren, Kelly, Martocchio, & Frink, 1994 ; Pinder, 1984, 1998). Locke and Latham (1990) remarked on the extreme reliability of predictions stemming from Goal- setting Theory, stating that failure to replicate findings was almost always due to errors, such as not checking for goal commitment or emphasizing proximal goals in uncertain environments. In 2005, Gagn\u00e9 and Deci remarked on the impact of Goal-setting Theory and the substantial amount of empirical support it has received (e.g., Erez, Gopher, & Arzi, 1990; Frese & Sabini, 1991; Sheldon & Elliot, 2000). Goal-setting does not imply motivation and good performance unless accompanied by the prerequisites of commitment to the goal (goal commitment) and requisite ability in the task (Locke & Latham, 1990). If medical students with sufficient abilities have set goals and have sufficient goal commitment, they are believed to be more likely to remain motivated to perform until they reach their goals (e.g., committing to a specialty; Locke & Latham, 1991). Medical students' ability in a specialty is predicted to affect their degree of commitment to that specialty. Although medical students all share similar levels of ability and plan to complete their medical 35 degrees, their specialty goals may be affected by their abilities in different types of medicine (e.g., surgery versus family practice). Finally, although goal-setting research originated within industrial and organizational literature, it has been successfully applied outside of workplace domains (e.g., sports; Lerner & Locke, 1995; Rieger & Gauggel, 1999). Goal-setting Theory is applicable to any self-regulated activity (Locke & Latham, 2002) and, therefore, is theoretically applicable to all goal-striving processes and research, including those relevant to medical education. A review of literature applicable to medical student education showed no application of Goal-setting Theory to medical student education and choice of medical specialty to date. Obtaining a medical degree is difficult and requires sustained commitment (Princeton Review, 2011). The current study applies Goal-setting Theory to the goals of medical students. Specifically, the current study will measure medical students' degrees of commitment to (1) earning a medical degree, and (2) choosing a specific specialty or specialties, with emphasis on the latter. Entering medical school is more than stepping through glass doors. It is an outward expression of a much larger, future goal. When an individual makes a future goal, his or her goal-striving includes what the goal represents rather than simply the goal itself (Kuhl, 1985). An individual going into medicine may wish to have the opportunity to help others, obtain financial stability, and enjoy social prestige. Goal-setting is a common practice especially for those involved in long-term educational programs such as medical school. Goal-setting theories suggest that time-oriented variables (e.g., time related to goal attainment) be considered as influential on CLE variables that may result from the HCR (Locke & Latham, 1991). For example, medical students' perceptions about being a physician in a changing health care system may be influenced by their year in medical school (i.e., Y1, Y2, Y3, or Y4). By entering medical school, medical students have implicitly set a goal to obtain a medical degree (M.D.). The process of earning an M.D. takes a minimum of four years in medical school and an additional three to seven years in residency to become credentialed in a specialty or subspecialty. For the purposes of the current research, students in the first four years of striving toward the goal of obtaining an M.D. are discussed, because these years are the time during which medical students are under the supervision of the medical training institution. Choosing a medical specialty is an important decision process that takes places during the first 36 four years. With regard to the HCR, the two goals (1) becoming a Medical Doctor, generally, and (2) committing to a medical specialty, were hypothesized to be affected by how students perceive the HCR. For the purpose of discussion, commitments to a medical specialty are emphasized throughout the literature review. Medical students have most likely gathered information about what being a physician entails. They may have gathered information about places where they will be likely to work, instruments they may use, approximate salary, hours of work, and daily details of becoming a physician. With each new piece of information, a cost-benefit analysis continues (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) with regard to their choice of becoming a Medical Doctor and their choice of specialty. New information may change the way medical students view their medical goals and the environment in which they must perform medical goals. For example, with regard to the HCR, they may remain stable in their positivity, or become more optimistic or pessimistic about their career and its environment. Various studies have found a positive correlation between optimism and success in performance (e.g., Gould, Dieffenbach, & Moffett, 2002; Norlander & Archer, 2002 ; Scheier & Carver, 1985). Studies have shown that decreased optimism is associated with decreased goal commitment (e.g., Solberg Nes, Segerstrom, & Sephton, 2005). A later study by Solberg Nes and Segerstrom (2006) found relationships between optimism and the increased use of approach coping strategies. Conversely, optimistic individuals used fewer avoidance coping strategies. Goal Specificity Goal-setting Theory has focused on goal specificity as a variable that indicates the degree of generality of the task to be completed (Locke, 1997). Locke (1968) emphasized the importance of a goal's specificity, difficulty, and intensity in the degree to which it may affect an individual's commitment to a goal. For medical students, specificity may be viewed as the number of possible specializations they are considering. Medical students who remain uncertain and/or uncommitted to a sole medical specialty choice may exhibit lower degrees of commitment to those specialties in medical school compared to their more certain/committed peers. Medical students lacking commitment to their medical career and specialty goals may be at risk of failing to succeed in reaching those goals. 37 Locke and Latham stated that goal completion is more likely when goals are specific, rather than vague (1990; Locke & Latham, 2002; Latham, Locke, & Fassina, 2002). In 1989, Locke, Chah, Harrison, and Lustgarten's findings indicated that goal specificity is negatively related to ambiguity. Goal specificity plays a role in the lives of medical students as they gain experience and knowledge that help them determine which specialty for which to strive during the remainder of their time in medical school and residency (Held & Zimet, 1975; Senf, Campos- Outcalt, Kutob, 2005; Zeiger, 2004). Goal Commitment Hollenbeck (1979) stated that persistence in a goal process results from subsequent evaluations of success in that process and later choices that remain consistent with the original choice. Necessarily, the original goal must continue to have more motivational power than other potential goals that may arise. In other words, Kuhl (1982, 1985) said that individuals with higher commitment would persist with the original goal regardless of new enticing goals that might unseat the original. Tubbs (1993) discussed the possibility that primary goals are maintained by avoiding giving attention to other possible choices, allowing the original choice to remain as the default choice without competition. However, if evaluation takes place and the value of the goal decreases, motivation and commitment to the goal may wane correspondingly (Tubbs, 1993). Critical life events, such as the HCR, are believed to be disruptive to the normal flow of life, such that CLEs could cause medical students' to evaluate goal values and subsequent commitment. In contrast, some medical students might avoid evaluation of other goal options (e.g., modifying their medical specialty commitment) regardless of their feelings about the HCR. Proximal goals. A goal also provides a plan of action that a person will follow. Typically, along the path to a super-ordinate or distal goal, an individual may measure his/her progress toward the distal goal by striving toward and attaining smaller sub-goals, or proximal goals (Raynor, 1981). Research has shown that setting proximal goals leads to increased performance and other benefits (e.g., increased SE; Bandura & Schunk, 1981 ; Bandura & Simon, 1977; Latham & Seijts, 1999). Without an efficient set of proximal goals that lead to a distal goal, a person is likely to encounter decreased performance (Dorner, 1991; Frese & Zapf, 1994). Moreover, Husman and Lens (1999) found that students' motivation is significantly increased by setting smaller, proximal sub-goals in the present that are part of the path to long-term, super- ordinate goals. Thus, it seems plausible that the further a medical student is in his/her medical 38 education (i.e., Year), the more proximal goals each student will have completed, thus promoting increased commitment to the distal goal trajectory of completing his/her medical degree. Furthermore, the prominence of the HCR as an issue of relevance to medical students' daily lives is believed to be greater for those who are further in their medical education. Students just entering medical school (i.e., Y1 students) are more focused on preparing for exams and early benchmarks of progress (Held & Zimet, 1975). Medical students in the later years of medical school have begun to pay attention to transitioning their medical knowledge to the real world. By thinking about issues beyond the medical education years, it was considered probable that the HCR would be perceived as a more relevant issue for those students in later years of medical school (e.g., Y4). Essentially, for veteran medical students, there are fewer proximal goals left before reaching the distal goal of obtaining the medical degree. When focus is shifted from the proximal goals to the distal goal, the conditions of the distal goal (practicing medicine under the HCR) are likely to become more relevant and worthy of greater consideration. Situational constraints. Klein and Kim (1998) identified many possible inhibitors that may diminish a person's capacity to translate goal commitment into actual behavior (e.g., goal blockages, environmental constraints). Hollenbeck and Klein (1987) and Peters, O'Connor, and Eulberg (1985) suggested that situational constraints may provide obstacles to performance, diminishing performance levels despite ability and motivation. Situational constraints, such as lack of resources (e.g., time, money, information), interfere with an individual's performance motivation by decreasing perceptions of expectancy (Peters et al., 1985), thus lowering goal commitment (Hollenbeck & Klein, 1987). Research by Mathieu, Tannenbaum, and Salas (1992) illustrated the negative relationship between constraints and a person's motivation. In their study, situational constraints (e.g., \"enough time to complete the task\"), rated on an instrument developed by Peters, Cassie, Lindholm, O'Connor, and Kline (1982), were shown to have a significant effect on 140 university employees' ratings of motivation items (adapted from Lawler, 1981) during a training. Peters et al. (1982) maintained that situational constraints moderate the goal difficulty and performance relationship. They found that goal difficulty was no longer significantly related to performance when constraints were high. Environmental uncertainty has been cited as a common situational constraint to effective goal-setting processes (Locke & Latham, 1990). Environmental uncertainty could mean that information required to set goals is unavailable as with Role Ambiguity (RA), which describes 39 the degree of uncertainty an individual has in their daily role (e.g., medical student). However, environmental uncertainty can be distinguished from RA in that Locke and Latham described environmental uncertainty as external to the expected goal process, while RA has been specified as ambiguity or uncertainty that is intrinsic to or develops within the educational or occupational system. Even if necessary information is available, in a time of rapid environmental changes, it may quickly become obsolete (Seijts & Latham, 2001). For example, during an interview, a female survivor of Hurricane Katrina described how the loss of a normal environment, external to graduate school, led her to change her degree plans (Goodin, 2008). Seijts and Latham (2001) contended that uncertainty is inversely correlated with distal goal-setting and goal commitment. Research by Latham and Seijts (1999) demonstrated the moderating effect of proximal goals on reaching distal goals in an uncertain environment. Changes in health care as a result of the HCR may inhibit or alter medical students' goals and behavior by creating environmental uncertainty. In contrast, Earley (1985; 1986) found that knowledge and information about how to reach a goal increased goal commitment. If events such as the HCR present uncertainty in medical students' goal processes or cause them to reevaluate their final goal objects (i.e., specialty choice), medical students' goal commitment should be correspondingly inhibited by a lack of confidence toward their specific goals (i.e., decreased Self-efficacy). Self-efficacy and Medical Students In recent years, Self-efficacy (SE) has been shown to predict motivation and learning (Zimmerman, 2000). Self-efficacy can be simply defined as an individual's confidence about performing a specific future task (Bandura, 1977a, 1977b). Zimmerman distinguished it psychometrically and conceptually from other motivational variables (e.g., expectations of outcome, locus of control, self-concept), in that it determines perceived capability based on performance. Bandura (1977a, 1977b) was among the first researchers of SE, promoting a theory of predictors, mediators, and related beliefs. Social Cognitive Theory emphasized SE as a result of Bandura's study of therapy with phobic individuals. In early trials, phobic individuals, through implementation of therapeutic techniques, were able to successfully approach the target of their fears (e.g., a snake) and developed similar outcome expectances in combating their phobias. However, Bandura found individual differences in participants' perceived capabilities for 40 implementing the techniques on their own, outside of the therapeutic setting. He called this individual difference Self-efficacy (SE; 1977a, 1977b). He later differentiated between SE and outcome expectations, emphasizing SE as predictive of outcome expectations (Bandura, 1986). He stated that \"the types of outcomes people anticipate depend largely on their judgments of how well they will be able to perform in given situations\" (Bandura, 1986, p. 392). He would later describe SE as an individual's evaluation of his/her capabilities to effectively expend effort to reach a specific goal (1997). Bandura initially focused on three measures of SE across various activities and contexts (1977a, 1977b, 1997). The level of SE refers to the perceived difficulty of a specific task. SE generality indicates the ability of SE beliefs to be transferred from one set of activities to others. Finally, the strength of SE is a measure of the degree of certainty an individual has toward performing a task. Medical students with a great amount of strength, or degree, of SE toward succeeding in the specialty of most interest to them may be likely to maintain higher degrees of commitment to said specialty. Bandura focused on individual tasks that varied in difficulty. Rather than assessing individual's personal characteristics (e.g., physical strength, intelligence), he focused on performance capabilities, wherein individuals would assess their capability to meet task demands (1977a, 1977b, 1997). Furthermore, as indicated by varying measures of generality, SE is multi- dimensional. For a medical student, a high SE rating for taking a medical exam may not be coupled with a high SE rating for speaking with patients. Bandura (1977a, 1977b, 1997) also believed that SE for an activity (e.g., public-speaking or winning a tennis match) might vary by context (e.g., familiar audience/unfamiliar audience or hometown/away). According to Bandura's (1977a) original work, SE is based on individual performance (mastery criterion) rather than comparison to others (normative, performance- based), although a norm reference does seem to play a role in SE beliefs when an individual uses comparison to others as a way to inform his/her knowledge about his/her capabilities. Finally, based on expectations of one's capabilities to perform in a future event, Bandura believed that SE would play a causal role in academic motivation, which could then affect degrees of commitment and subsequent performance. Thus, SE is predict ed to play an important role in understanding how reactions to the HCR by medical students are affecting their academic motivations in medical school. 41 Bandura (1998a, 1998b) noted that individuals' SE beliefs may be greatly associated with their degree of optimism toward the goal outcome, such that SE would be correlated to the outcome expectancy in the goal task (e.g., success). SE beliefs are highly associated with outcome expectations and other similar constructs (e.g., HCR Outlook), self-concept (SC), and perceived control, but have conceptual and psychometric differences (Bandura, 1986). Shell, Murphy, and Bruning (1989), in a study of reading and writing achievement, found that efficacy beliefs and outcome expectances (utility for achieving future goals; e.g., social prestige) jointly explained 32% of the variance in reading performance, the great majority of which was accounted for by perceived efficacy. SE was the only variable to significantly predict writing achievement. Therefore, Shell et al.'s findings support the discriminant validity of SE measures and Bandura's emphasis on SE above outcome expectancies in explaining motivation. SE measures are believed to be related to medical students' degrees of commitment as they proceed toward their ultimate goals (e.g., specializing in psychiatry). Marsh and Shavelson (1985) described SC as a general construct that comprises many types of knowledge and emotions about oneself. Essentially, SC is a present-focused view of one's capabilities, while SE is a future-focused view of one's capacity for task success. Although originally a global perception (Rogers, 1951), more specific sub-categories of SC were developed to evaluate, for instance, academic SC (Harter, 1978; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985). Whereas SC evaluations might ask a student, \"How good are you in Algebra?,\" SE evaluations might ask students, \"How certain are you that you can solve a trinomial equation?\" . Researchers who have attempted to compare the SE and SC concepts have obtained conflicting findings. Overall, SE results are more specific, and predictive than those of SC. In a 1994 study of first-year university students, Pajares and Miller found that SE was more predictive of mathematical problem solving than mathematical SC. In 1999, Bong and Clark reviewed academic SC and SE research in an exploratory comparison of the two constructs. Whereas SC showed greater complexity by including both cognitive and emotional responses toward the self, it was heavily influenced by comparison to social norms, while SE focuses on cognitive judgments alone regarding capabilities based primarily on mastery criteria rather than the norm. In their review, Bong and Clark found that SC research has been mostly correlational, while SE research has been more experimental due to SE's greater consistency of operational 42 definitions, context, and specific assessment. In the reviewed research studies, SE was shown to have contributed greater predictive and explanatory ability than SC. A study by Bong and Skaalvik in 2003 focused on similarities between SE and SC. They noted the similar abilities of both constructs to predict motivation, emotion, and performance. They noted differences between the two constructs that led them to the conclusion that SE is an active precursor of SC development. SC integrates cognition and affect, while SE separates the two. SC is an evaluation of competence that is norm-referenced, rather than goal-referenced as with SE. SC is aggregate, past-oriented and temporally stable, while SE is specific to context, holds a future orientation, and is malleable. Due to the nature of the current study emphasizing specific goal tasks, SE is the more appropriate construct to be studied at present. According to Zimmerman (2000), SE's adaptation to specific tasks can vary in scope based on the research purpose from an academic domain (e.g., microbiology) to a sub-skill (e.g., microbial identification). Zimmerman used the word \"correspondence\" to describe the scope of the task in relation to the SE. Pajares (1996a) found that the predictive ability of SE was positively related to the specificity of the task and the correspondence of the skill. However, due to the differences among participants in the current study (i.e., different years in medical school), a general measure of SE is used. Self-efficacy beliefs have been found to have convergent validity in explaining academic motivation (Bandura, 1997). Bandura found that students with greater SE were likely to participate more eagerly, put forth more effort, persevere for greater durations, and remain emotionally stable when encountering difficulties. Furthermore, self-efficacious students take more positive risks and are more likely to take on difficult or challenging tasks (e.g., complex mathematics problems; Bandura & Schunk, 1981). SE has been correlated with a perseverance, students' college major, and academic success (Hackett & Betz, 1989). Self-efficacy beliefs predict effort in the form of performance and energy expenditure. For instance, SE has been shown to be positively associated with students' mental effort during a learning exercise (Salomon, 1984) and math problem-solving speed (Schunk, Hanson, & Cox, 1987). Schunk (1981), through path analysis, found that SE's positive effect on students' persistence is directly and indirectly related to increases in students' skill acquisition. Using an instructional treatment, he found a direct effect of SE on persistence and achievement and an indirect effect of SE on persistence. Furthermore, Multon, Brown, and Lent (1991), in a meta- 43 analysis of almost 70 studies of persistence, found that students' SE beliefs positively impacted academic success. More recently, Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, and Pastorelli (2001), in a study of 272 children, found that children's SE is the primary predictor o f their preferred choice of occupation and their perceived SE beliefs in their work. In 2007, Pajares, Johnson, and Usher, in a study of 1,256 K-12 students' writing SE, found that mastery experiences explained the largest amount of variance in students' SE. In a 2005 study by Zajacova, Lynch, and Espenshadet, the researchers studied 107 nontraditional (primarily minority and immigrant) freshmen at a community college regarding the relationship of their SE and stress. Their findings suggested that SE was a robust, consistent predictor of academic stress. Using path analysis, Chemers, Hu, and Garcia (2001) found academic SE's effect on stress was mediated entirely by perceptions of demands as threats or challenges. Conversely, physiological arousal states related to stress and anxiety play a role in individuals' SE beliefs (Pajares, 1996; Solberg et al., 1998). Bandura (1998a, 1998b) contended that individuals' SE beliefs are based to some degree on the positive affect (i.e., excitement, enthusiasm) or negative affect (i.e., fear, anxiety) they experience when coping with a specific goal or task. Similarly, Hackett et al. (1992) contended that students' SE beliefs are decreased by stress and anxiety. Hence, although SE and effort are strongly associated, the evaluation of the potential stressors as threats or challenges may play a role in arousing or decreasing SE and, thus, effort expenditure. With regard to the current study, should medical students perceive the HCR as a CLE that poses a threat rather than a challenge, they may have lower SE beliefs about their goals as medical students. Evaluations of stressors as threats or challenges may have an emotional impact on SE. The relationship of SE and emotion (e.g., stress) may be founded in Lazarus' cognitive model of stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) that posited the view that personal beliefs (e.g., Self-efficacy) are crucial for evaluation of environmental demands as threats or challenges. Research has found that individuals with higher SE are more likely to view environmental demands as \"challenges\" (positive valence; Chemers, Hu, & Garcia, 2001; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990). In other words, the degree to which individuals have confidence that they can succeed in a task affects their emotions regarding the demand (i.e., stressful, threatening, or challenging). A demand that is perceived as a challenge has greater likelihood to prompt an individual to choose an effective coping strategy and persist toward goal completion (i.e., sustain goal commitment). Thus, Bandura (1995) contended that SE mediates the relationship between external stressors 44 (demands) and psychological stress. According to Bandura (1997), students' higher SE to manage academic demands may improve their emotional health (i.e., decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression). With regard to the HCR as a potential CLE among medical students, students that view projected HCR changes to the medical profession as challenges to be overcome are likely to remain efficacious in their ability to adapt to any possible changes. In contrast, those that evaluate the HCR's potential effects on the medical field as threatening are likely to have decreased SE beliefs about performing within their medical education and medical career goals. A medical student who feels threatened by the possible changes to take place in health care might say \"I feel less confident about my ability to succeed as a physician in this new system,\" a statement of lowered SE beliefs. Research by Pajares and Kranzler (1995) supported Bandura's belief that SE may predict performance in their finding that SE predicted math performance in a path analysis. Research by Siegel, Galassi, and Ware (1985) showed SE, compared to math anxiety, to be a better predictor of math performance. Although math anxiety was not found to be a significant predictor of math grades, self-efficacy beliefs accounted for 13% of math grade variance. Again, studies such as Pajares and Kranzler (1995) and Siegel et al. (1985) further supported the discriminant and predictive validity of SE measures. According to Bandura (1989), agency is the autonomy, or freedom, of a person to perform a task or tasks. Bandura felt that SE beliefs played an essential role in influencing students' agency (1982). Zimmerman, Bandura, and Martinez-Pons (1992) found that there is a positive relationship between students' perceptions of their capabilities and the degree of challenge in the goals they choose to strive toward. Further, Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) showed that SE and personal goal-setting jointly add significant predictive power for some types of achievement. Their research showed that SE and personal goal-setting, in combination, were better at predicting students' final scores in a college writing course than were prior grades in social studies and the verbal subscale on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) by 31% and 35%, respectively. Self-efficacy beliefs are also related to students' self-monitoring. Self-monitoring and self-regulation are concepts that describe a student's ability to learn autonomously without external pressure or regulation. In a concept learning study, Bouffard-Bouchard, Parent, and Larivee (1991) found that students with greater self-efficacy exceeded their colleagues in their 45 ability to solve conceptual problems, despite having equal ability levels. Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) found that SE beliefs affect the standards by which students evaluate their work as they self-monitor the outcomes of their work. They found that SE for writing beliefs significantly predicted college students' goal setting and writing proficiency as well as the quality of writing with which they were self-satisfied. Furthermore, SE beliefs may promote the implementation of learning strategies. In grades five, eight, and eleven, Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons (1990) found developmental increases in students' efficacy toward implementing verbal and mathematical strategies. Among the three grade levels, SE beliefs and strategy had 16-18% shared variance. A meta-analysis by Multon et al. (1991) showed that almost 14% of the variance in students' academic performance was explained by students' SE, indicating that SE's stimulation of motivation and self-regulated learning contributes to greater academic achievement on a number of measures. Again, the convergent validity of SE beliefs is supported by the relationship of SE beliefs and self-regulation. Influences on Self-efficacy Beliefs According to Zimmerman and Bandura (1994), Self-efficacy beliefs are determined by four types of experience, each of which are represented in the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE; Jerusalem & Schwarzer, 1995) used in the current study: mastery (enactive) experience, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion (social encouragement), and physiological states. Zimmerman and Bandura contended that mastery experiences, of the four types of experiences, have the greatest influence on SE beliefs because they are personal experiences and, thus, have the most predictive power for future success in the same or similar tasks. For example, if a medical student has successfully measured blood pressure within a medical school practice context in a past encounter, they are more likely to believe that they can measure the blood pressure of a patient in their third year rotations. Vicarious experiences have less predictive power on performance because they depend on an individual's self-comparison with a model (or other) doing the same or similar task (Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994). A phrase that illustrates the influence of vicarious experience on SE is \"If they can do it, certainly I can do it as well.\" In the medical school environment, a second year student could perhaps speak to a third year student who passed the USMLE-1 resulting in an increase in the personal belief that he/she is as capable as the third year student and, therefore, is as likely to be able to successfully pass the USMLE-1. However, should the 46 second year student believe the third year student to be more capable than him/herself, the student is likely to have no change in SE beliefs about passing the USMLE-1. Only with self- comparisons that evaluate the successful other (or model) as similar or less capable will the individual's SE beliefs be bolstered. Vicarious experience, alone among the effects on SE, depends to some extent on comparison to a norm, or model (Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994). Although SE was originally described as completely criterion-referenced (Bandura, 1977a), vicarious experience illustrates the influence of the norm on an individual's SE beliefs. Although SE is still generally considered to be an individualized, performance, criterion-referenced variable, the influence of comparison to specific others, not necessarily everyone, does not support the contention that SE is solely criterion-referenced. Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) believed that verbal persuasion, or social encouragement, has even less impact on SE beliefs than mastery and vicarious experiences. In such cases of social situations, a social entity (mother, father, friend) may explain their firm belief that the individual can successfully perform the task in question. Verbal persuasion can be as simple as clapping, cheering, or as complex as a long, explanatory pep-talk explaining the rationale of why the individual who will be performing the task should believe in his or her ability to be successful in performing the task. Zimmerman and Bandura pointed out that the credibility of the persuader has great power in such situations. Verbal persuasion from a friend who is perceived as a good, knowledgeable judge of the individual's skills should have comparatively greater influence than encouragement from a stranger who is unfamiliar with the individual's abilities. Finally, Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) postulated that students' SE beliefs were also driven by their interpretations of their physiological reactions to stimuli. Just as butterflies in the stomach on wedding days can be view ed by an individual as \"cold feet\" or as a natural reaction of excitement, students may perceive the sweat on their palms and forehead as their body telling them that they are unprepared or that they are excited and ready to succeed. Fatigue and stress are common indicators of physical incapability to perform the task at hand. In contrast to other self-beliefs that are assumed to have stability throughout time and context, SE beliefs are believed to be indicative of adjustment during times of change (e.g., HCR) or intervention (Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994). With regard to goal-setting and 47 commitment, medical students' SE beliefs may be improved by receiving training on how to set proximal goals (Bandura & Schunk, 1981 ; Schunk, 1981). Conversely, SE beliefs may be diminished by experiencing failure. Zimmerman and Bandura (1994) concluded that SE beliefs are unique in comparison to related motivational constructions based on their sensitivity to experiential differences (e.g., year in medical school) and situational context (e.g., health care reform). This sensitivity conceptually and psychometrically distinguishes the cognitive Self-efficacy beliefs from the trait self-beliefs and related motivational constructions. Twenty years of research on SE have shown ho w students' motivation and learning is clearly predicted by SE beliefs. It demonstrates convergent validity in predicting multiple types of motivation and discriminant validity as a unique predictor of academic outcomes (e.g., student goal choices, persistence, effort, and emotional reactions). Researchers have studied the relationship of uncertainty to SE (e.g., Campbell, 1988), specifically focusing on the added complexity that uncertainty adds to striving towards a goal or completing a task. In 1986, Cervone and Peake found differences in individual's SE beliefs by simply altering the possible performance attainments of a task. By increasing the uncertainty of participants' goals, Cervone and Peake (1986) found that students were less self-efficacious about their ability to succeed in the task. As medical students strive toward their medical career goals, the current study seeks to understand how perceptions of uncertainty about the HCR play a role in their SE beliefs and decisions about their medical goals. Role Ambiguity and Medical Students Most ambiguity research has been focused on Role Ambiguity (RA) within the workplace (e.g., customer service, company mergers, employee satisfaction; Singh, Goolsby, and Rhoads, 1994; Jackson & Schuler, 1985; Hartline & Ferrell, 1996, respectively), but has direct implications for first-year (novice) graduate students. New jobs, like medical school, can represent new salary (i.e., new financial status), new employers (i.e., new powerful others), new duties and responsibilities, and, in general, 'change.' They differentially affect the new employee (or novice graduate student) based on individual characteristics such as resistance to change, satisfaction with the employment (or education program), and background, especially experience that assists the neophyte in acclimating to his or her new situation. It may be difficult for veteran employees or students to remember the feelings and thoughts of their first days at work or in a 48 new program. However, at first, the new job or study program (e.g., medical school) brings one primary issue, RA, to the forefront of new employees' and students' lives often without conscious attention. The new medical student may be asking him/herself, \"What are my duties here?\" or \"How do I manage my time to find success?\" . These questions exemplify RA, or not knowing exactly what one must do and what is expected of him or her. In the words of House and Rizzo (1972) RA was defined as the \"lack of clarity and predictability of the outcomes of one's behavior\" (p. 475). In their classic study, Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, and Rosenthal (1964) explained that RA occurs in situations where information is absent or insufficient to provide role clarity. In regard to employees, even when the job position seemed to be quite clear in an interview, it is common for important details to have been omitted in the early days of employment. The current review of literature on the topic of RA explores its applicability to medical students, specifically. Generally, RA may arise from poor communication and complex organizational structures with respect to an individual's duties, authority, and allocation of time to tasks (Rizzo et al., 1970). Role ambiguity is one of many role stressors (e.g., Role Conflict [RC]). Classical Role Theory explains the threat of role stressors in light of the amount of demand that they place upon the cognitive and emotional resources of the individual. Role stressors, such as RA, cause stress in that, according to Kahn et al.'s (1964) model, they require the individual to disburse additional energies to appraise and execute appropriate coping responses to minimize the potential negative effects of the stressor. Organ and Greene (1974) interpreted studies by Kahn et al. (1964) and Rizzo et al. (1970) to \"imply that role ambiguity is aversive and, further, that it is a product of the organization and its environment\" (p. 101). Studies of RA, one of the most frequently researched areas of work stress, have commonly focused on RA's strong influence on work-family conflict (Jackson & Schuler, 1985). Other researchers have shown that RA has consistently been found to influence individuals' commitment to an organization, satisfaction with their jobs, and intentions to quit their jobs (Brunetto, Farr-Wharton, & Shacklock, 2011; Kalbers & Cenker, 2008). A considerable amount of research has explored the relationship of ambiguity to factors of work-related success. For example, Singh, Goosby, and Rhoads (1994), in a study of 377 customer service representatives, found significant associations between ambiguity and performance. In a considerable number of 49 studies of employees, research has shown that RA is negatively related to performance (e.g., Singh, 1998; Singh, 2000; Singh, Verbeke, & Rhoads, 1996) and employee satisfaction (e.g., Dubinsky, Jolson, Michaels, Kotabe, & Lim, 1992; Hartline & Ferrell, 1996; Singh, 1995). With regard to the relationship of RA with SE, Hartline and Ferrell (1996), in a study of 797 hotel employees, found that ambiguity lowers SE. In the current study, the direct and indirect effects that RA has had on the performance and satisfaction of employees in the workplace are believed to be applicable to the situation of medical students. Miles (1976) found that RA had a moderate to strong relationship to job-related tension and anxiety, job satisfaction, and attitudes toward role senders (e.g., employers). RA had an inverse relation to an individual's perceived effectiveness. RA may play a similar role within a medical education program, influencing work/family conflict, commitment, satisfaction, and attrition. Additionally, RA may lead to medical school-related tension, anxiety, and negative attitudes toward faculty. The importance of RA research in industry is well-established (Jackson & Schuler, 1985), although RA may also be seen in such situations as families, social groups, and student functioning (e.g., medical school). In light of the significant impact that RA can play in human lives, understanding its processes is necessary, especially if researchers and practitioners wish to combat its potential dangers. In reviewing the literature, several moderating variables (e.g., Amount of Experience) help explain the nature of RA's effects. One specific example given by Jackson and Schuler (1985) explained how the convergence of two companies into one can create discordance between the values of the merging systems. Companies that are the product of a merger underscore yet another situation that lends itself to higher levels of RA. When companies merge, positions within the merged company are often altered or ended, creating confusion, and thus RA, for the individuals involved in those positions. The structural changes that are inherent to a merger or horizontal alliance lead to further RA (e.g., two managers of marketing now must work together or one must find a new position). The example of a merger seemed especially pertinent with regard to the changes brought about by the HCR. In a sense, t here is an ongoing merger between the \"old health care system\" and the \"new health care system,\" brought about by the HCR. Jackson and Schuler's (1985) review discussed moderating variables that were believed to lend explanation of the effects of the relationship of Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey 50 (HCRTS) ratings with RA. Since medical students are in different years of medical school, Amount of Experience (AOE), a variable that often moderates the influence of RA, is relevant to the current study. Since medical students' year in school represents a stratification of each student's amount of experience, Year is expected to be related to RA in a similar fashion. Amount of Experience The aforementioned association of RA with stress fails to adequately explain the underlying mechanisms that answer the question, \"Why does RA differentially affect individuals?\" Jackson and Schuler (1985) suggested that moderating variables helped explain the negative impact of RA. Individual differences in AOE highlight the relationship between RA and stress. For example, medical students in later years (Y3 & Y4) of medical school, thus having greater AOE, are expected to have less RA than students in their beginning years (Y1 & Y2). Jackson and Schuler's (1985) review showed how AOE can moderate the effects of RA. Jackson and Schuler suggested that AOE should be taken into account by those seeking to improve work and study environments to alleviate stress situations. Therefore, it is useful to discuss the role that AOE may play in the lives of medical students with regard to RA in the study environment of medical school. Jackson and Schuler's (1985) findings that those with higher AOE should be less affected by RA were obtained within a static environment, rather than the dynamic environment of the current HCR. As discussed with regard to Goal-setting Theory, situational variables such as the HCR are important to emphasize as they highlight moderators of RA and stress relationships. Though stress, by name, is not a variable emphasized in the study, reactance (the arousal of tension) was described as a type of stress by Inglehart (1991) with regard to CLEs. Thus, associations of RA with stress support the hypothesis that RA is related to reactance in the current study of medical students. For the current study, AOE is viewed as medical students' year in school (Year). There is evidence that those in the beginning stages of a new role of any type are greatly susceptible to RA. For example, nursing students have been found to experience the greatest challenge and stress during their initial months of graduate nursing school (months 3-6; Godinez, Schweiger, Gruver, & Ryan, 1999; Greenwood, 2000; Jarvis, 2000). When dealing with adjustment, as seen in research regarding new graduates in the workforce, unclear responsibilities may result in RA (Horsburgh, 1989), resulting in decreased condence (Kramer, 1985; Speedling, Ahmadi, & Kuhn-Weissman, 1981), unrealistic or conflicting expectations (Kelly, 1996), lack of support 51 (Hartshorn, 1992 ; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990), and increased responsibility (Gerrish, 2000 ; Jasper, 1996; Oermann & Moffitt-Wolf, 1997). Just as new work environments may result in RA (Rizzo, House, & Lirtzman, 1972), new academic environments, or any role environment undergoing subjectively perceived significant change may also result in RA for the individual in that role. According to Skovholt and R\u00f8nnestad (2003), the AOE that an individual has may moderate the impact of RA on stress measures. Previous experience with the same or a similar position or situation may help decrease the negative effects of the stress often caused by RA. Skovholt and R\u00f8nnestad (2003) found that RA is often accompanied by an overall experience of heightened ambiguity involving performance anxiety, new professional identity, appropriate use of conceptual maps, and personal expectations. A qualitative case study by Scheib (2003) looked into the effect of RA on music teachers with the premise that \"Role Ambiguity st ress is a result of both information deficiency and unpredictability\" (p. 18). To explain an inconsistent finding, Scheib posited that the AOE may decrease the effect of RA as evidenced in one veteran music teacher's statement: \"That sounds like a young teacher to me\" (Scheib, 2003, p. 7). Scheib believed that role expectations were very important. \"Often, stress comes from the incongruence of the teacher's expectations and beliefs versus what the system allows\" (2003, p. 135). It may be, therefore, that with experience comes a greater understanding of role expectations and alignment of behavior with those expectations. Unfortunately, such AOE effects assume system stability. A CLE such as the HCR is believed to possibly alter the effects that AOE has on RA, such that veteran students' expectations may become invalid and result in RA and stress. Skovholt and R\u00f8nnestad (2003) noted how the effect of RA could be greatly diminished for the novice by previous experience. With regard to the HCR, however, medical students in later years of medical school with greater amounts of AOE may require greater amounts of adjustment from their traditional roles and expectations. The HCR, therefore, is believed to be associated with greater RA for those with greater AOE (later year in medical school) if the HCR is perceived as a CLE for the individual. In the third year of medical school, medical students in most US medical schools begin clinical rotations, a departure from the curriculum-focused initial two years. As medical students must re-acclimate to changes in their medical school role in their third year, the hypothesized inverse relationship of AOE (Year) to RA is believed to be weaker. 52 Skovholt and R\u00f8nnestad (2003) explained that should the career for which one has received training be changed before the training is completed, the student may feel even greater disillusionment. While a disillusioned novice often reacts with anger and disappointment toward his or her previous educators or him/herself, those who experience a target change that nullifies or decreases the worthiness of training may choose alternative methods of reaction. Similarly, when jobs assume that novice employees have certain knowledge and abilities that they may or may not actually have, the employe es may feel ashamed and overwhelmed with trying to \"catch up\" (Skovholt & R\u00f8nnestad, 2003). Medical students are predicted to have a similar reaction to the possible demands of the HCR. With regard to RA in uncertain situations, Robiner, Furhman, and Ristvedt (1993) suggested that while some requirements for the future career may remain intact, other demands may feel like a \"moving target with an elusive criteria\" (p. 5). In addition, many of the expectations of the novice medical practitioner about the extent to which he or she can help people may be overly extravagant. With regard to idealized expectations, most individuals who earn a medical degree have high expectations of what they will be able to do with it (Skovholt & R\u00f8nnestad, 2002). Many expectations, idealized or reasonable, may be changed as the HCR continues to change the health care system. Role Ambiguity, although an expected, natural stress in the educational process, may be exacerbated by strong medical student reactions to the HCR. RA is a relevant outcome variable because it evidences how the HCR may affect the crucial daily functioning of the medical student. Synopsis of the Literature Medical education is a goal-striving process and can thus be understood within the theoretical framework of Goal-setting Theory. During the four years of medical school, medical students must become committed to specialties that they wish to pursue after medical school and solidify their top choices. For medical students, goal-striving is operationalized in terms of degrees of commitment. When events such as situational constraints limit medical students' abilities to pursue their goal(s), increase their levels of Role Ambiguity, or decrease their levels of Self-efficacy, medical student s are predicted to modify their goal or cease goal-striving. The HCR is one such situational constraint for some medical students that could be understood within the theoretical framework of Critical Life Event theory. 53 Goodin (2010): The Creation of a Health Care Reform Perception Instrument In 1991, Inglehart gave a comprehensive analysis of individuals' reactions to critical life events. Because of the possible usefulness of her theoretical framework for understanding a medical student's attitude toward the HCR, it was important to operationalize Inglehart's theoretical concepts. At the time of Goodin's earlier HCR research (2010), there was no instrument to measure Critical Life Events as described by Inglehart. Therefore, in order to understand medical students' perceptions of the HCR, Goodin developed and tested such an instrument with a purposive sample of medical students (N = 171) at a large, Southeastern university as described in the following paragraphs. The research questions were \"Does the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey assess medical-students' perceptions and reactions to the Affordable Care Act?\" and \"To what extent do medical students in years 1-4 indicate different ratings of perceptions and reactions to the health care reform as assessed by the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey?\" Categorizing Aspects of a Critical Life Event Inglehart's (1991) book described 36 aspects of critical life events. The creation of the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS), a measurement of CLE reactance to the health care reform beginning in 2010 began with the grouping of 36 aspects into six primary categories: (a) disruption, (b) outlook, (c) meaning-making, (d) certainty, (e) response options, and (f) evaluation. Determining Medically-Relevant Statements The HCRTS was developed to ascertain the types and degrees of reactions that medical students might have to the HCR. Goodin (2010) created items that related medical education to the HCR according to Inglehart's (1991) description of a CLE pattern of reaction. In so doing, the intent was to be able to measure the extent to which medical students reacted to the HCR as a CLE. Item creation was founded on several reports (e.g., Appleby & Steadman, 2010), opinion/editorial pieces on health care reform, and informal interviews of several current medical doctors, medical students, an educational psychologist, an anthropologist, and a political scientist. 54 The primary indicator that an event is perceived as a CLE is that the event requires an abnormal amount of cognitive attention by an individual (Inglehart, 1991). Such cognitive increases may be operationalized as the arousal of tension (both positive and/or negative). Although items were created to represent the aforementioned six representative categories of a CLE, they were not written with the assumption that all categorical items would load together in a factor structure. Finalized items were reviewed for face, construct, and content validity by an expert panel of 10 medical doctors and medical students who took the survey and provided feedback. All reviewers and interviewees reported that the instrument had face, construct, and content validity. General reactance items. Although all HCRTS item-responses may evidence the arousal of tension, or reactance (both positive and/or negative) of medical students, four (4) of the HCRTS items focused on reactance specifically. An example of this type of reactance item is \"The HCR causes me to feel anxious.\" These items were included in the then-proposed instrument to specifically measure reactance (Goodin, 2010). Medical students rated all items, including the four general reactance items, on a scale from one (strongly disagree) to six (strongly agree). The following paragraphs describe Goodin's (2010) six primary categories of cognitive behavior and an example of each: Disruption. Disruption items (7) either directly or indirectly measure the degree to which the HCR has caused arousal of tension and/or modification of the medical student's plan for achie ving future goals. An example of a disruption item is \"My choice of specialty is likely to be altered because of the HCR.\" Outlook. Outlook items (8) were intended to reflect the degree of positivity/negativity that the medical student has toward the event's ramifications. An example of an outlook item is \"I believe the reform will do more harm than good for our country\" (indicating a pessimistic outlook of the HCR's future ramifications). Meaning-making. Meaning-making items (11) reflect the degree to which individuals use cognitive strategies in order to adjust to or cope with a CLE. An example of a meaning- making item is \"I feel more positively about the reform if I think of it as the first step in a lengthy process.\" 55 Uncertainty. Uncertainty items (11) were intended to reflect the degree of uncertainty elicited by the CLE. An example of an uncertainty item is \"Before the reform, I was much more certain about what my future profession would be like.\" Response options. Response options items (13) were intended to reflect the extent to which individuals feel they have the ability to cope with the CLE. An example of a response options item is \"I feel like I can adjust to any changes that the reform causes.\" Evaluation. Evaluation items (4) are present- or past-oriented items that were intended to reflect the degree of positivity that the participant has toward the event itself, the reasons for the event's occurrence, and/or those to whom they attribute control of the event's occurrence. An example of an evaluation item is \"The reform was the wrong step toward changing the health care system.\" Findings of Goodin (2010) Goodin removed 25 of the original 55 items due to poor or no correlation with other items, an improved alpha coefficient without the item, or low factor loading within an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) of HCRTS ratings, leaving a 30-item, 4-factor solution wherein each subscale had moderate to high internal reliability (Reactance, =.866; Meaning- making, =.851; Uncertainty, =.604; Outlook, =.743). MANOVA results comparing students by year suggested medical students' ratings of the HCRTS subscales varied by year, Wilks' = .362, p < .001. Goodin's (2010) findings supported the HCRTS as a measure of CLE reactance and suggested that students at different points in their medical education (Year) are likely to perceive the HCR differently. However, Goodin (2010) did not provide a clear understanding of how HCRTS subscale ratings are related to degrees of Commitment due to an inadequate measurement tool of Commitment. A more effective measure of degree of Commitment is discussed in Chapter Three for the current study. Furthermore, two independent variables that relate closely to situations of uncertainty are added in the current study for explanatory power: Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy. Thus, the current study includes seven predictor variables (HCRTS Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, and Outlook, Role Ambiguity, and Self-efficacy) and one dependent variable (Commitment ). 56 Research Questions and Associated Hypotheses The following sections discuss hypotheses associated with each of the research questions based on literature and findings from Goodin (2010). Hypotheses were not made regarding relationships where there is a lack of empirical or theoretical support for such assertions; instead, some analyses are considered exploratory. In answer to the first research question, \"Is the hypothesized factor structure of the HCRTS replicated?,\" the hypothesis (H 1.1) is that the factor structure of Goodin (2010; see Figure 3 ) will be supported by the data. Furthermore, all hypotheses for research questions 2 through 5b are based on the assumption that H 1.1 is confirmed. Figure 3. Hypothesized Factor Structure of the HCRTS For research questions 2-5, the hypotheses are depicted in Figure 4. A plus (+) symbol indicates a positive association, while a minus (-) symbol represents a negative association. Each predicted path that has an associated hypothesis has a darker, thicker arrow line, while those paths without hypotheses are depicted by lighter, thinner arrow lines. For each research question and its associated hypotheses, Figure 4 should serve as a visual reference. The figure shows all theoretically relevant pathways that are predicted. The structural equation modeling process begins with all theoretically relevant pathways and removes nonsignificant pathways for parsimony. The second research question asks, \"What is the percentage of the variance in Role Ambiguity explained by Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, Outlook, and Year?\" For the Critical Life Event Reactance Reactance Meaning- making Uncertainty Outlook 57 dependent variable, Role Ambiguity, the researcher made hypotheses about two of five predictor variables. The first alternative hypothesis (H 2.1) is that Reactance ratings are associated with Role Ambiguity (RA). More specifically, Reactance is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA. Organ and Greene (1974) contended that research by Rizzo et al. (1970) and Kahn et al. (1964) implied that RA is an aversive factor, deriving from the organization (or educational institution) and its environment. With regard to the environment, Rizzo et al. gave the example of the extent of change or turbulence affecting the organization. Therefore, it may be that medical students' degree of RA may be explained to some degree by the extent to which the HCR is associated with general uncertainty, or reactance. Thus, among medical students, Reactance is likely to be positively associated with RA. Figure 4. Proposed SEM Model with Hypotheses . Note : The model represents all theoretically relevant pathways. 58 The second alternative hypothesis for the second research question (H 2.2) is that Uncertainty ratings are associated with RA. Specifically, Uncertainty is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA. The need for adjustment has been tied to RA in previous research (e.g., Jackson & Schuler, 1985). Lower Uncertainty ratings may indicate that medical students have higher certainty about the future. A higher score reflects medical students' belief that the HCR has a greater effect on their expectations about their goal paths (i.e., careers) and/or that they feel less able to adjust to any changes caused by the HCR. Students with higher Uncertainty regarding the HCR, perceiving significant environmental change surrounding their role and the need to adjust to that environmental change, are hypothesized to experience greater RA. In other words, among medical students, Uncertainty may be positively associated with RA. The third research question asks, \" What is the percentage of the variance in Self-efficacy explained by Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, Outlook, and Year?\" For the dependent variable, Self-efficacy, the researcher has made hypotheses about four of the five predictor variables. The first alternative hypothesis for the third research question (H 3.1) is that Reactance ratings are associated with Self-efficacy (SE). Specifically, Reactance is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. In 1986, Cervone and Peake found differences in individual's SE beliefs by simply altering the performance attainments of a task. By increasing the uncertainty of each participant's goal, they found that students were less self-efficacious about their ability to succeed in the task. Although SE is likely to bolster a medical student against reactance to the HCR, SE may be weakened for the individual as the environment for which they have SE is changed or altered. Thus, among medical students, Reactance is predicted to be negatively associated with SE. The second alternative hypothesis for the third research question (H 3.2) is that Uncertainty ratings are associated with SE. Specifically, Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. As previously stated, SE may be weakened for individuals as the environment for which they have SE is changed or altered. If medical students are uncertain about the future of the health care reform (higher Uncertainty), their SE toward their medical career goals may decrease correspondingly. Thus, among medical students, Uncertainty is predicted to be negatively associated with SE. 59 The third alternative hypothesis for the third research question (H 3.3) is that Outlook ratings are associated with SE. Specifically, Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. According to Bandura (1998a, 1998b), individuals' SE beliefs are based to some degree on how positively or negatively aroused they feel about their goal tasks. Higher Outlook ratings are predicted to be evidenced by negative arousal (e.g., pessimism) toward general and specific medical goals. Thus, among medical students, Outlook is predicted to be negatively related to SE. The fourth alternative hypothesis for the third research question (H 3.4) is that medical students' year in school (Year) is associated with SE. Specifically, Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with SE. As stated in the literature review, Bandura (1997) found that students with greater SE were likely to persist for longer durations and remain emotionally stable when encountering difficulties. Schunk (1981) found that SE had a positive effect on students' persistence. In 2007, Pajares et al. found that mastery experiences explained the largest amount of variance in students' SE. Thus, among medical students, Year is predicted to have a positive relationship with SE. The fourth research question asks, \" What is the percentage of the variance in Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy?\" For the dependent variable, Commitment, the researcher has made hypotheses about 2 of 2 (both) predictor variables. For Research Questions 4 and 5, it is important to again note that the current study intend ed to build upon Goodin (2010) to more clearly and accurately measure Commitment. In the current study, Commitment is measured in two ways: (1) Commitment to the medical degree, and (2) Commitment to the specialty of greatest interest. The first alternative hypothesis for the fourth research question (H 4.1) is that RA ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, RA is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Commitment. Kahn et al. (1964) explained that RA occurs in situations where information is absent or insufficient to provide role clarity. Since Commitment has been shown to decrease when information needed to complete goals is lacking (Earley, 1985; 1986; Seijts & Latham, 2001), medical students' RA is predicted to be negatively related to their Commitment. Kahn et al. also showed that RA causes stress, another factor that has been shown to inhibit goal commitment (Tubbs, 1993). Furthermore, in the workplace, RA has been shown to be negatively related to Commitment (Brunetto, Farr-Wharton, & Shacklock, 2011 & Kelloway, 2011; Singh, Goosby, & Rhoads, 1994). Thus, among medical students, RA is predicted to have a negative relationship to Commitment. The second alternative hypothesis for the fourth research question (H 4.2) is that SE ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, SE is hypothesized to be positively associated with Commitment. SE has been shown to predict achievement (Berry, 1987; Multon et al., 1991; Schunk, 1981; Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994), suggesting a positive relationship between SE and Commitment. Locke, Frederick, Lee, and Bobko (1984) confirmed the positive relationship between SE and Commitment in their research findings. Thus, among medical students, SE is predicted to have a positive relationship with Commitment. The fifth research question asks \"What is the percentage of the variance in Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables?\" For the dependent variable, Commitment, the researcher has made hypotheses about all seven predictor variables. The first alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.1) is that Reactance ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, Reactance is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Commitment. Based on the implications of CLE theory (Inglehart, 1991), the disruption implicit for students with higher ratings of Reactance is believed to be negatively associated with the degree of Commitment for those students. Therefore, among medical students, Reactance is predicted to be negatively related to Commitment. The second alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.2) is that Meaning- making ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, Meaning-making is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Commitment. Meaning-making items as described by Goodin (2010) suggest the use of cognitive strategies by medical students to respond to uncertainty and Reactance which they may feel as a result of the HCR, similar to the cognitive strategies that Inglehart (1991) described among individuals reacting to a CLE. According to Seijts and Latham (2001), uncertainty is negatively related to Commitment. Therefore, among medical students, Meaning-making is predicted to be negatively related to Commitment. The third alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.3) is that Uncertainty ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Commitment. As with the previous hypothesis, Seijts and Latham (2001) contended that uncertainty is negatively related to commitment. Therefore, among medical students, Uncertainty is predicted to be negatively related to Commitment. 61 The fourth alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.4) is that Outlook ratings are associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Commitment. Optimism (i.e., low Outlook ratings) has been associated with success in performance in many research findings (e.g., Gould, Dieffenbach, & Moffett, 2002; Norlander & Archer, 2002 ; Scheier & Carver, 1985). Researchers have found that optimism is negatively related to withdrawal or disengagement from achieving a goal (e.g., Gaudreau & Blondin, 2004; Nes, Segerstrom, & Sephton, 2005). Solberg, Nes and Segerstrom (2006) found that optimistic individuals are likely to use less avoidance strategies and a more approach coping strategies. Therefore, among medical students , Outlook is predicted to be negatively related to Commitment. The fifth alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.5) is that medical students' year in school (Year) is associated with Commitment ratings. Specifically, Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with Commitment. As previously mentioned, Earley (1985; 1986) found that knowledge and information regarding how to reach a goal increased commitment. With each year in school, there is increased experience and increased pressure to solidify favorite specialties to which to be committed (Paiva, Vu, & Verhulst, 1982). Thus, non- favorite specialties should decrease in degrees of Commitment, while favorites should continue to have high degrees of Commitment or increase even higher. Generally, Year is predicted to be positively related to Commitment. The sixth alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.6) is that RA ratings, within the context of all other predictors, retains a similar association with Commitment ratings. Specifically, RA is hypothesized to remain negatively associated with Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. The seventh alternative hypothesis for the fifth research question (H 5.7) is that SE ratings, within the context of all other predictors, retains a similar association with Commitment ratings. Specifically, SE is hypothesized to remain positively associated with Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. 62 CHAPTER THREE RESEARCH METHODS The current study examined the research questions regarding relationships of medical students' perceptions of the HCR with regard to their Year in medical school in order to predict degrees of Role Ambiguity, Self-efficacy, and Commitment. Goodin (2010) established initial indications of the validity and reliability of the HCRTS instrument and perceptual differences among medical students in different years of medical school. The current research sought to replicate the findings of Goodin (2010) with more clarity and inclusion of relevant, explanatory variables and the dependent variable, Commitment. Research Design The current study was quantitative, using a cross-sectional approach to determine the extent to which medical students report ed different reactions to the HCR across the four years of medical school (Y1-Y4) and to what extent those reactions were predictive of degrees of Role Ambiguity, Self-efficacy, and Commitment (see Figure 4). Although treated here as an ordinal variable (i.e., nearness to matriculation, Year (i.e., cohort) could also be viewed as an categorical variable. A cross-sectional approach allowed immediate understanding of cohort differences during the critical period in which emotions and cognitive activity about the H CR were likely to peak (i.e., during the Presidential Election of 2012). Parceling Item parceling was used in the current study to make the model more parsimonious, requiring a smaller sample size. According to Little, Cunningham, Shahar, and Widaman (2002), item parceling is a controversial practice that has been highly debated (e.g., Bandalos & Finney, 2001; Cattell & Burdsal, 1975; Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998). Little et al. (2002) describe parceling as an \"aggregate-level indicator comprised of the sum (or average) of two or more items, responses, or behaviors\" (2002, p. 2) that is most often used in multivariate approaches to psychometrics, predominantly with latent-variable analysis techniques (e.g., SEM). Hall, Snell, and Foust (1999) differentiated between item scale or subscale scores and parcels stating that \"item parcels differ from subscale or scale scores in that the entire set of item 63 parcels reflects a single primary factor or latent construct, whereas a set of item subscale scores reflects several separate (although generally closely related) latent constructs\" (p. 214). Opponents to the use of parceling argue that it undermines the principle that \"modeled data should be as close to the response of the individual as possible in order to avoid the potential imposition, or arbitrary manufacturing, of a false structure\" (Little et al., 2002, p. 2). However, a pragmatic-liberal perspective suggests that undermining of measurement principles may be avoided by justification and clarity of parcel usage so that the reader and subsequent research can evaluate the merit of parcel usage. In fact, one argument in favor of parcel usage is the psychometric merit of the parcel compared to the individual item. In contrast to aggregated data, item data may have lower reliability and communality. For item data, the ratio of common- to- unique factor variance is likely to be smaller. Furthermore, item data leads to an increased likelihood of distributional violations. Compared to items, parcels have more plentiful, smaller, and more equal scale point intervals (Hau & Marsh, 2004). Item parceling requires fewer parameters to define a construct (Bagozzi & Edwards, 1998), so with relatively small sample sizes, parceling is preferred (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994). Parcel usage was also promoted by Marsh and Hovecar (1985) on the basis that it increases item- to-subject ratio that, when low, may result in an unstable factor solution. Furthermore, according to Little et al. (2002), due to the advantages of parcels (e.g., psychometric and estimation), the various indexes of model fit are anticipated to be more acceptable for parcels than with items. Furthermore, models based on parceled data, rather than item-level data, are more parsimonious in that they have fewer estimated local parameters that define the construct and global parameters that represent the model. Secondly, models based on parceled data decrease the possibility of correlated residuals or the emergence of dual loadings since they use fewer indicators and have smaller unique variances. Finally, models based on parceled data reduce various sources of sampling error (e.g., random error; MacCallum et al., 1999). Rushton, Brainerd, and Pressley (1983), based on multiple empirical studies, argued for aggregates in lieu of single items to represent psychological constructs. Individual items are less likely to represent a construct, while, compared to aggregate scores, individual item scores are less statistically reliable. Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade (1999) remarked that systematic variance unrelated to the focal latent construct may be problematic if an item is associated with 64 an item(s) that loads on the same component. Little et al. (2002) added that a person's true score on a construct is better represented by multiple items instead of a singular item. Issues of normality (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) become less likely with aggregate scores than with item- level scores. Aggregation increases the number of scale intervals, and, as more items are aggregated, the distance between points becomes smaller and more equal. Thus, the intervals become smaller and more continuous in nature. In a study by Hau and Marsh (2004) regarding empirical and predicted standard errors, the parameter estimate variability decreased as the sample size increased, but the effect on the non-normality in the estimates of variability was very small. Finally, aggregation minimizes diversity of indicators targeting the centroid of the intended construct. Little et al. (2002) contended that fewer indicators per construct improve the measurement by decreasing spurious correlations, decreasing unpredicted shared variance among subsets of items, and improving the stability of the model (e.g., smaller standard errors). Ultimately, fewer indicators for a latent construct improve the likelihood of good model fit. Despite the positive aspects of parceling, Bandalos and Finney (2001), for example, believed that parceling should only be considered when the latent construct is unidimensional. When the dimensions that underlie a construct are not congruent or clear, item parceling should be avoided. Using unclear or multidimensional parcels could distort the measurement model by biasing the loading estimates such that latent construct variance could not be reliably interpreted. Before parceling begins, Little et al. (2002) noted the prerequisite of determining the dimensionality of the items to be parceled. Then, there are several techniques for parceling items. On average, random parceling of items should result in parcels containing roughly equal common factor variance (Nasser & Wisenbaker, 2003). For larger SEM models, Little et al. (2002) suggested the use of an item- to-construct balance technique. To create three parcels from six items, for instance, each parcel may be created by combining one of the three highest loading items with one of the three lower loading items in an inverted order (e.g., highest loading item with sixth highest loading item). An a priori questionnaire construction technique has been used by several researchers (e.g., Little & Wanner, 1997) to parcel positively-worded items with negatively-worded items in order to reduce the positivity versus negativity bias (Hau & Marsh, 2004). Little et al. (2002) specified, however, that item responses must be evaluated to ensure conformation to the expected patterns (i.e., perceived by respondents in the intended manner). 65 An additional method of item parceling was performed by Nasser, Takahashi, and Benson (1997) who used item parcels to test the structure of a test anxiety model among Arabic-speaking students. Items were parceled based on content similarity and factor structure resulting in better model fit than unpacketed items. According to empirical and practical support in findings by Nasser-Abu and Wisenbaker (2006), a parcel of unidimensional content should contain four to six items. However, given the slightly lower item totals in some of the scales to be used in the current research, some of the parcels contain ed as few as three items per parcel. With regard to employing item parceling when there is multidimensionality in the measure, Kishton and Widaman (1994) offered two options, the first of which, the internal consistency approach, parcels items according to the different dimensional facets, resulting in a higher stratum latent construct and keeping the multidimensionality of the construct explicit. The second option, the domain-representative approach, parcels items from different facet sets to encompass common variance and reliable unique facets of the multiple dimensions. Kishton and Widaman (1994) found that the latter option leads to better stability and model fit. Little et al. (2002) concluded that the goals of the study should decide whether parceling is appropriate. A goal to understand the multidimensional nature of the construct and the indications of individual items would be thwarted by parceling. A goal of understanding the general effects of a latent variable to cancel out nuisance factors warrants parceling. Thus, a parceling technique was selected to create a set of parcels that would allow estimation of the number of parameters in the proposed model, and subsequent power analysis to predict a sufficient sample size for the current study. Sample Size A power analysis was imperative to effectively plan to recruit a sample sizable enough to make valid and reliable conclusions. Furthermore, measurement error may result from an a priori power analysis that is imprecise. In order to reduce the chance for error in the current study, calculating the required sample size, level of statistical significance, statistical power, and effect size were considered a priori. MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (1996) provided guidelines for power analysis and sample size determination at the model level. An a priori analysis was conducted using R*Power (R version 2.13.0; The R Development Core Team, 2008), a program for determining the sample size necessary for sufficient power. The statistical analysis employed in the current study was structural equation 66 modeling. Some researchers have noted that 10 participants per parameter would be necessary to obtain adequate sample size and power (e.g., Kline, 2011). The current study had 61 parameters in the model, calling for a total of 610 participants needed to provide sufficient power for the SEM analyses. Alternatively, specific model criteria were employed to attain desirable power and degrees of freedom. Using the program R*Power (2.13.0), power analysis criteria of a .05 alpha level, 100 degrees of freedom, and an ideal power of .80 were selected. Additionally, the null RMSEA of zero was selected to indicate a perfect fit of the model to the data. The alternative RMSEA of .05 was selected to identify a reasonable fit (Kline, 2011). Based on the stated criteria, R*Power results of sample size estimation for the current study suggested that 155 participants were necessary to achieve reasonable fit of the model to the data. Given two separate ad hoc power analyses calling for sample sizes of 610 or 155, Kline (2011) suggested that best practice is to use the larger sample. Therefore, 610 participants was set as the minimum sample size needed for the current study in order to maintain adequate power. Ideally, the sample was to contain 100 participants from each year of medical school. According to Charlton (2000), there is no official acceptable response rate. A 33% response rate is common for online surveys (Nulty, 2008). However, among medical students, response rates have been found to be somewhat lower. In a study by Paolo, Bonaminio, Gibson, Partridge, and Kallail (2000), 164 medical students were either given paper or email survey requests. Email survey requests returned a 24% response rate (15 of 64) compared to 41% (34 of 83) for paper survey requests. Paolo et al. also found that response rates did not increase after the second week of survey availability despite a reminder after the first week. Like Paolo et al., Cook, Heath, and Thompson (2000) found that response rates for online surveys compared to paper surveys (face- to-face) were much (20%) lower. It is noteworthy to acknowledge the substantial increase in use of online media in the past decade as support for a possible increase in expected response rates. In order to improve the response rate of the online survey, techniques promoted by Z\u00fa\u00f1iga (2004) and Quinn (2002) for online surveys were employed. Both emphasize the need to \"push the survey,\" or make it as easy as possible to take the survey. For example, providing a direct link to the survey through an email is believed to be advantageous. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga called for three reminders for every survey, although others have remarked on the diminished return on the 67 investment alongside the possibility of irritating the population (Cooke et al., 2000). Finally, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga asserted that faculty involvement in the request for participation can be greatly beneficial to response rates. Nulty (1992) remarked on the participants' views of whether or not their responses would be used or taken seriously. With regard to rewards, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga cited that a raffle or lottery reward improves response rate. Quinn (2002) explained that the longer a survey is available, the greater the chance that students will respond. Thus, he advocated for extending the duration of a survey's availability. Although informed consent specified that all questions are optional, Quinn suggested that specifying to students the choice of optional questions will make the survey a more intrinsically motivating process. Research by Dommeyer, Baum, and Hanna (2002) showed that anonymity was a concern for students in choosing whether or not to complete a survey. Ensuring and emphasizing confidentiality should help improve response rates. Quinn also said to make sure that participants were familiar with their online environment or survey. It is important also to have adequate introduction and instructions for how to take the survey. According to Nulty (2008), with a random sample of 2,000 possible participants, for instance, a conservatively (3% sampling error, 95% confidence level) adequate response rate would be 25%. To the degree that each medical school was willing to comply, the survey was disseminated to students by a faculty member who the students knew personally, with clear instructions and format, was followed by reminder survey requests, was available for approximately three weeks, and was promoted by a raffle of gift cards (five $100 Visa Gift Cards for five different winners). Although response rate cannot be controlled, all methods of reaching maximum response rate with the medical student sample were employed for the current study. In order to reach sufficient power, a sample size of 610 was required. Based on the approximate number of total students at all participating schools (approximately 15 schools with approximately 400 students per school), an approximate response rate of 10% was required. Furthermore, such a response rate would meet what Nulty (2008) considered to be an acceptable response rate for a large sample size (i.e., N = 2,000; between 1% and 25%). Although Nulty deemed it liberally acceptable to have a very low response rate (e.g., 1%), for the current study of approximately 2,000 potential medical student participants, every ethical method of increasing the response rate to 25%, deemed conservatively acceptable by Nulty, or above were employed. 68 Recruitment and Data Collection Sampling and Recruitment Procedure Using a list of all 132 medical schools in the continental United States, the researcher contacted each one by email and/or phone. The researcher contact ed an administrator in each school to ask for permission and assistance to request their medical students' participation in the study until permission was obtained from all schools that were willing to participate. The administrator to contact varied by title at each school, but was often a dean of medical education or student affairs. Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from FSU for the current study, the researcher obtain ed proper IRB (or other) approval from all other schools that were participating (when required). Based on schools that agreed to participate, the setting for the current study was fourteen medical schools and colleges in the continental United States. Typically, Y1 and Y2 students attend classes on campus, while Y3 and Y4 students may study at off-campus locations for their rotation (clinical) experiences. The medical schools that were involved provide basic medical training that can lead to further, more-specialized training in over 20 areas (e.g., plastic surgery). After receiving approvals and finalizing a methodological plan with each school, the researcher administer ed the survey entitled \"Medical Education Decisions Survey - Second Edition (MEDS-SE)\" to medical students at all participating schools. Either the primary contact (administrator), an intermediary specified by the administration of each medical school, or the researcher (when permitted) used list-serves to email a link to an on-line version of the survey to all Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 students at each participating school to ask them to complete the research survey. Each participant who completed the survey was entered into a raffle for one of five $100 Visa gift cards in appreciation for their participation. Within the framework of the FSU IRB, medical instructors who were serving as intermediaries could only give extra credit to participants who were also given an alternative for the extra credit. There were no exclusion criteria for current medical student participants. Survey Procedure and Informed Consent As part of the online MEDS-SE survey, medical students were given an informed consent form (see Appendix B) along with a survey package (see Appendix C). Medical students were 69 informed of the general purpose of the study (\"to better understand medical students' perceptions of the health care reform\") by email. The researcher then wrote reminder emails that survey administrators or the proper contact for each school forward ed to the students to increase the response rate to the extent to which the administrator and school were willing. These reminders specifically targeted students that might have forgotten to participate. The questionnaire took an average of 15 minutes for students to complete. Participants were able to choose to not answer an item or to discontinue participation at any time. However, in case an item had been accidentally skipped, the online survey tool, Qualtrics , prompted participants that they had skipped an item(s) only once, before allowing them to continue the survey. In order to be entered into the participation raffle for their survey completion, students were asked to provide (within the survey) an email address that was only associated with confirmation that the student completed the survey. In order to protect anonymity and confidentiality, email addresses were separated from all other data until deletion after reward distribution. Any physical data (e.g., print-outs) and digital data stored on a password-protected computer were stored in a locked office at all times. In total, the final sample consisted of 1,486 medical students. Assuming that all students in the 14 participating medical schools opened the email that asked them to participate in the survey, the overall response rate was 27.2%. More details on the sample composition are provided in the Results section. Instruments For the current study, students' demographic information (specifically medical student Year), Self-efficacy beliefs, degrees of Role Ambiguity, their Commitments to their degrees, their Commitments to medical specialties, and their responses to the HCRTS were pertinent for analysis. The items evaluated for each variable are shown in Appendix C. The demographic section of the survey included open-ended items to obtain students' basic demographic information (i.e., age, ethnicity, gender, year in school). Furthermore, in order to understand the possible influence of political alignment on HCR biases, the researcher ask ed medical students about their political views. Since political views are a somewhat sensitive, private issue for many people, the researcher ask ed these questions last in the survey and 70 emphasized that they were strictly optional. Although no school requested the change, the sociopolitical questions could be removed entirely from the online survey if required. With regard to the surveys below, the dimensionality of the constructs was tested after data collection. If a construct was shown to not be unidimensional in the current study, an exploratory factor analysis was used to determine how to appropriately separate the items for accurate analysis and understanding. Commitment Survey General Commitment items (3) were adapted from Hollenbeck, Williams, and Klein (HWK; 1989b) for medical students by replacing the words \"this goal\" with \"this degree\" and \"this specialty\" for two separate operationalizations of Commitment to medical goals. The original HWK Goal Commitment scale included nine items that represented 2-factors: goal commitment and performance expectancies. The three highest loading items from the goal commitment factor were used in the current study. The HWK (1989b) is a self-report scale, considered to be the most widely used measure of goal commitment. It has been used to assess goal commitment in a great variety of research areas including traditional goal settings (Tubbs & Dahl, 1991), car accidents (Cooper, Phillips, Sutherland, & Makin, 1994), absenteeism (Harrison & Schaffer, 1994), creativity (Carson & Carson, 1993), and personality (Barrick, Mount, & Strauss, 1993). For the current study, the HWK was used to measure medical students' commitment to two dependent variables: (a) their medical school degree; and (b) their medical school specialty. An example of an item from the instrument is \"I am absolutely committed to pursuing this degree.\" All items were scored by participants with regard to medical students' agreement with the statement on a Likert-type scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Two items (4 and 5) were added to the three HWK Commitment items to provide descriptive understanding, but were not to be included as part of the dependent variable. Self-efficacy Survey In order to measure medical students' Self-efficacy beliefs, the current study employ ed the General Self-efficacy (GSE), a unidimensional measure (Scholz, Guti\u00e9rrez-Do\u00f1a, Sud, & Schwarzer, 2002) developed by Jerusalem and Schwarzer in 1981. The authors' stated purpose for the instrument was to \"assess a general sense of perceived Self-efficacy with the aim in mind 71 to predict coping with daily hassles as well as adaptation after experiencing all kinds of stressful life events\" (p. 29). The instrument was meant for use with adults and adolescents above age 12. The favorable psychometric properties (i.e., high reliability, stability, and construct validity) of the GSE scale have been confirmed by many research studies (e.g., Leganger, Kraft, & Roysamb, 2000; Schwarzer, Mueller, & Greenglass, 1999) and with many samples. The GSE has been researched in 23 nations, resulting in Cronbach's alphas ranging from .76 to .94, and averaging around .88 (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995). For example, Luczcynska, Schultz, and Schwarzer (2005) obtained Cronbach 's alphas of .94 (cardiovascular diseases patients), .89 (cancer patients), .90 (students), .87 (gastrointestinal disease patients), and .87 (swimmers). An overview of the criterion validity of the GSE by Luszczynska, Guti\u00e9rrez-Do\u00f1a, and Schwarzer (2005) related the multitude of correlational studies that have established the criterion-related validity of SE as measured by their instrument, showing positive associations to optimism, job satisfaction, and positive emotions as well as negative associations with stress, health complaints, anxiety, depression, and burnout. An example of a GSE item is \"I can usually handle whatever comes my way.\" In the current study, the GSE items were scored by participants with regard to medical students' agreement with the statement on a Likert-type scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). All 10 of the original GSE items were used for the study without modification of their contents. Role Ambiguity Survey In 1970, Rizzo et al. developed the Role Ambiguity and Role Conflict scales that have been used extensively since their development (Van Sell, Brief, & Schuler, 1981). Based upon the results of studies by Schuler, Aldag, and Brief (1977) and House, Schuler, and Levanoni (1983) , the Rizzo et al. Role Ambiguity and Role Conflict scales accurately measure two role constructs: Role Conflict (RC) and Role Ambiguity (RA). A meta-analysis of 63 studies (N = 15,956) of RA by Jackson and Schuler (1985) obtained a Cronbach's alpha of .89. Studies by Van Sell, Brief, and Schuler (1981), Schuler et al. (1977), and Jackson and Schuler (1985) found that, in comparison with RC, RA had average correlations with similar constructs and was often associated with variables with which RC did not associate. Additionally, the convergent and discriminant validity of the Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity scales were supported by the findings of Netemeyer, Johnston, and Burton (1990). They found standardized item loadings (for RA: .703, .403, .817, .814, .642, .636) and scale reliabilities (for RA: = .831) and the variance 72 extracted estimates (.314 and .476, for RC and RA respectively) to be acceptable as well. Based on additional psychometric findings (i.e., adequate item and scale statistics) of the RA and RC scales by Smith, Tisak, and Schmieder (1993), they encouraged the continued use of the scales in tandem or separately. For the purposes of the current study, only the RA scale was used. In the current study, the RA items were scored by medical students with regard to their agreement with the statement on a Likert-type scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Five of the six original RA items were used for the current study, based on the advice of Smith et al. (1993) that item 3 of the RA scale be excluded due to poor factor loading. Whereas the stems of the items remained intact, the phrase \"as a medical student\" was added to the items to specify the role that they should consider in their response. An example of an RA item is \"I know what my responsibilities are as a medical student.\" Therefore, the five items to be used were predicted to maintain unidimensionality, but were tested again for unidimensionality after data collection. Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey The Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS) instrument was constructed in four phases: (a) defining the construct as a critical life event, (b) categorizing aspects of a critical life event, (c) determining medically-relevant statements that represent the factors of a critical life event, and (d) evaluating validity (face, construct, and content). Face validity is the extent to which the instrument is perceived to measure what is says it measures (Fink, 1995). For instance, a survey that says it measures intelligence, but focuses on amount of studying may have low face validity. In contrast, content validity is based on the degree to which a measure represents its intended domain of content (Kline, 2011 ). Construct validity describes the ability of an instrument to operationalize the construct in order to accurately represent the construct of measurement as theoretical foundations say it should (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). On the HCRTS, medical students rated the HCRTS items on a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The items were not distributed equally across subscales (Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, and Outlook) after Goodin's (2010) EFA. While Reactance had 17 items, Meaning- making had six, Uncertainty had four, and Outlook had three. Since the Reactance subscale was a more general measure of disturbance resulting from a CLE, the greater number of items within that subscale was acceptable for further development of the HCRTS. However, in order to increase the reliability of the Meaning-making, Uncertainty, and Outlook subscales, a minimum 73 of three additional items for each subscale were pilot-tested for face validity with a medical doctor and a group of current medical students for planned inclusion in the survey. Those students who agreed to participate in pilot-testing the HCRTS were asked questions about their perceptions of the items in relation to what the researcher intended the items to measure. Three medical students and one Medical Doctor stated that the items had sufficient face validity for representing the subscales for which they were created to represent. Therefore, the 30 retained items of the HCRTS were supplemented by 15 additional items, created with the purpose of balancing the number of items on each subscale. The pilot-testing students were asked to not participate in the survey. Reverse-scored items. With regard to reverse-scoring, only HCRTS instrument items required reverse-scoring. Items on the HCRTS were reverse-scored based on conceptual meaning, such that items would be reverse-scored only when reverse-scoring made conceptual sense. Items 4, 35, 9, 14, 34, 42, 31, 33, 2, 8, 29, 44, 3, 41, 25, 12, 40, and 16 were reverse- scored (18 items). For each subscale, items were reverse-scored, when appropriate, such that higher responses on all subscales represented greater disturbance. In the case of Outlook items, items were reverse-scored such that high scores indicated negativity or pessimism, although positivity or optimism might also indicate disturbance. For Reactance and Uncertainty, only high scores represented disturbance. 74 CHAPTER FOUR RESULTS The present study examined medical students' perceptions of the health care reform and how those beliefs impact ed their career goals. All allopathic medical schools in the continental United States were contacted, inviting them to allow their students to participate in the study. Medical students completed an online survey, which examined their demographics, their perceptions of the health care reform, their self-efficacy, their role ambiguity, and their commitment to their medical career goals. This chapter presents the data obtained from the online survey. The purpose of this chapter is to present the preliminary analyses (descriptive statistics of the sample; the reliability of the measure) and an overview of the analyses (i.e., statistical analyses of the data). The HCRTS was created to analyze medical students' perceptions and intentions toward their career goals. Thus, the study sought to best fit the HCRTS instrument (see Figure 3) and the proposed SEM model (see Figure 4 ) to the data. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to analyze the fit of the HCRTS instrument, while structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the fit of the SEM model. The research questions are stated in Chapter 2. Preliminary Analyses and Overview of Analyses The planned analyses for the respondents' data included the following: a preliminary analysis, a descriptive analysis, a correlational analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and a path analysis. All analyses were based on certain assumptions. Assumptions The study made the assumption that the national population of medical students would be represented by obtaining the responses of a random national sample of schools and students. Because the participants were comprised of a self-selected sample, this assumption of representativeness was not met. 75 Preliminary Analyses In order to check for and correct errors and erroneous survey responses as well as to verify survey completion, all data were transferred into a spreadsheet. All email addresses were removed from the spreadsheet and stored in another spreadsheet until all raffle winners were rewarded. The remainder of the data was then transferred to SPSS for preliminary analyses. Frequencies, descriptive statistics, and outlier detection were used to affirm that the data were somewhat normally distributed. The percentage of missing data for each variable was calculated and the full information maximum likelihood method was used to accommodate the missing data for factor analysis and path analysis. SEM Analysis To evaluate the research questions, associated hypotheses were created to provide more specific understanding of the associations among variables. Data were transferred to MPlus 7.0, a structural equation modeling (SEM) software, in order to answer the research questions and test the hypotheses of the predicted model. The predicted model included variables and predicted directions of causality based on empirical research, CLE Theory (i.e., HCRTS), Goal-setting Theory (i.e., Goal Commitment), theories of organizational stress (i.e., Role Ambiguity), and Social Cognitive Theory (i.e., Self-efficacy) . Explanatory and Confirmatory Factor Analyse s (EFA and CFA) were used initially to test the HCRTS measurement model, before testing of the full model (all variables included) by path analysis. In order to thoroughly answer the first research question, a CFA of the HCRTS was conducted along with a test of the assumptions of a CFA (e.g., multivariate normality). CFA utilizes the several fit indices and model specification techniques that can be performed in MPlus using robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation to test model fit. Although the Chi- square (2) is the most basic measure of fit (Kline, 2011) . A non- significant 2 chi-square statistic is evidence of good model fit, meaning only that the model is consistent with the covariance matrix. In contrast, a significant 2 statistic suggests that the model may not fit the data well. Kline suggested that alternatives to chi-square indices may be evaluated, especially due to its susceptibility to sample size influence. Alternate fit indices that are commonly used in addition to 2 include the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Bentler Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). The RMSEA measures badness-of-fit, such 76 that a value of zero indicates the best possible fit. Browne and Cudeck (1993) suggested that a RMSEA value of .05 or below supported good fit of the model to the data. The CFI estimates the improvement in fit of the proposed (i.e., researcher's) model over the null model. Many researchers suggest that CFI and TLI statistics of .9 or greater are evidence of adequate model fit, though some researchers cite .95 as the threshold for adequate model fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2011). Whereas the CFI is dependent on sample size, the TLI is somewhat independent of sample size. The SRMR measures the overall difference between the observed and predicted correlations (Kline, 2011). Hu and Bentler contended that an average absolute correlation residual (i.e., SRMR value) of .08 or lower was evidence of acceptable fit, although Kline noted that individual values might still exceed the .08 threshold, such that they should be inspected in the matrix of correlation residuals. The following indi ces were obtained in MPlus: RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR. Kline (2011) suggested that all fit indices be evaluated as a whole to appropriately determine the adequacy of model fit. Modification indices may be used to determine associations in a model that were not specified, such that adding said associations to the model, when theoretically and conceptually supported, would reduce t he 2 and degrees of freedom through relaxation of the model. Kline cited a common rule of thumb in SEM literature that sample correlations are not well explained unless their corresponding standardized residuals were not significant (i.e., assumed to be equal to zero). Thus, items with standardized residuals of 2.56 or greater should be evaluated for removal. Similarly, the loadings of items on latent constructs should be evaluated, such that nonsignificant factor loadings may be considered for removal in order to improve model quality. Descriptive Characteristics of the Sample Of the 132 allopathic medical schools in the continental United States, 17 schools initially agreed to allow their students to participate. However, due to logistical issues, only 14 (10.6% of 132) schools were able to disseminate the online survey to their students. The total number of possible participants across all participating schools was 7,721. Ultimately, 1,527 medical students responded to the survey. Individually, school response rates ranged from 6.2% to 39.4%, with an overall response rate of 19.8%. 77 Situational influences played a large, yet unquantifiable, role in the response rates of each school. For example, one of the lowest response rates came from a school whose administrator reacted to the low response rate without surprise, citing conflicting obligations (e.g., tests), that may have taken priority over participation in the voluntary survey. Another school was unable to allow its students to participate in the raffle, resulting in a 14.8% response rate. Response rates improved the most (almost doubling the percentage) in schools that were able to give reminder emails to the students. One school gave no reminders to its students, while two other schools gave only one reminder to their students. Eleven schools disseminated the initial survey opportunity and reminder emails at two weeks and four weeks. After the fifth week, the survey was closed. Table 1 Participating Medical School Characteristics Based on the geographic delineations of the U.S. Census Bureau (2013), schools that participated were representative of every region of the United States, although only some divisions were represented: Pacific (1), West South Central (1), East North Central (5), East South Central (1), New England (2), Middle Atlantic (1), and South Atlantic (3). Equal effort was given to the recruitment of all allopathic schools in the continental United States. In an attempt to allay possibly large characteristic differences, allopathic medical schools that were not in the continental United States and osteopathic medical schools were not the focus of the current Medical School Acceptance rate (%)a Median MCATb Median GPAb Public or Privatec S.

More detailed characteristics for each of the participating schools are included in Table 1 in order to provide context to the results of the data collected. Data Screening The purpose of data screening is to assure that the data are appropriate for the planned statistical analyses. Data cleaning provides evidence that the data are valid and reliable by checking for missing data or abnormalities . A total of 1,527 unique individuals responded to the online survey. There were no inclusion criteria beyond being a currently enrolled medical student. Initial analysis of missing cases was concerned only with missing cases to the most \"important\" questions (i.e., involving independent or dependent variables). A total of 16 participants left more than five important questions blank and were removed from the data set. Furthermore, individuals who gave the same answer on over 95% of HCRTS items were highlighted as \"suspect observations\" for having potentially provided invalid responses. An additional 25 participants of the suspect observations were removed from the study due to invariance of response pattern (i.e., answering all 1s throughout the survey) and failing to answer categorically dichotomous items invariantly (akin to a lie scale), suggesting that those answers might not accurately display the participant's true opinions. Thus, a total of 1,486 observations were retained as the final data set to be analyzed for the current study. In order to test the assumption of multivariate and univariate normality, outliers were detected and evaluated, using numerical evidence (i.e., z-scores) followed by graphical analysis of histograms, box plots, and normal probability plots. Standardized scores ( z scores) for each item were used to test for univariate normality (i.e., outliers). For the five primary variables of the study, a non-outlier was defined as -2.4 < ip< 2.4, where ip= (x x )SD and = 1, ... , ; = 1, ... I ; = 1, ... ,5 . With regard to possible multivariate outliers, high residuals and high leverage on Cook's distance indicate a potential multivariate outlier (Cousineau & Chartier, 2010). All but one Cook's D value in the current data set were smaller than 0.05. One single value was 0.48, but was less than 1.0, indicating that it is unlikely to be a multivariate outlier as judged by Cook's D. A second test for possible multivariate outliers is Mahalanobis distance. Large values that are highly different from most other values suggest higher leverage which, in turn, indicate possible multivariate outliers. Some Mahalanobis distances did not converge. This is not of 79 concern and likely resulted from specific matrix computations not being valid (e.g., non- invertible covariance matrix). The Mahalanobis distances range from approximately 0.07 to 5.8. The mean for these values was 1.49 (SD = .80). However, no single point differed drastically from the remaining set of Mahalanobis distances. Based on Cook's D and Mahalanobis distance, no observations were indicated as possible multivariate outliers. Because there was no substantial difference between the EFA and CFA results with outliers removed versus results with outliers included, the latter results are reported. Missing data cases that occurred randomly are considered to be Missing At Random (MAR; Muth\u00e9n et al., 1987). Muth\u00e9n et al. promoted the MAR assumption concerning missing cases as a less restrictive assumption about the missing data that allows the missing cases to be ignored. MAR cases can be considered for imputation by one of many common methods used with structural equation modeling (SEM). Of the options for imputation in the current study, the most inappropriate method appeared to be mean imputation, which has been shown to result in biased parameter estimates in regression and SEM studies (Brown, 1994; Wothke, 2000). Alternatively, listwise deletion, a second strategy for dealing with missing data (Enders & Bandalos, 2001), excludes all observations (i.e., participants) that have a missing data case. It is easy to implement and allows univariate statistics to be compared, but creates inefficient parameter estimates by disregarding large amounts of complete data. Enders and Bandalos (2001) discussed pairwise deletion, a third strategy for dealing with missing data. Pairwise deletion is able to use the entire data set by only discarding cases on a variable by variable basis. Conflicting findings regarding the effectiveness of pairwise deletion suggest a need for further investigation (e.g., Brown, 1994; Marsh et al., 1998). Maximum likelihood (ML) strategies for dealing with missing data should yield unbiased parameter estimates with MAR cases (Enders & Bandalos, 2001). ML estimates should be more efficient than pairwise or listwise deletion. The full information maximum likelihood (FIML) method approach can be found in AMOS and MPLUS, as a result of and contributing factor to its popularity. Assuming multivariate normality, FIML computes a casewise likelihood function using only variables that are observed for the ith case. Therefore, a case i is used to estimate all parameters that have complete data. Additionally, FIML is able to use partially complete cases to estimate parameters from missing portions of the data. 80 FIML is able to reduce bias that would result from listwise deletion (Enders & Bandalos, 2001). Research has supported the ability of FIML to provide unbiased parameter estimates when listwise and pairwise estimates failed (Enders & Bandalos, 2001 ; Wothke, 2000). FIML was employed in the current analyses using robust maximum likelihood (MLR). Missing data were identified using Microsoft Excel. Using the \"find\" function, the researcher searched for the number \"999,\" which was the number used to identify a missing data entry. The researcher also searched for blank spaces. Using these two search methods, the researcher was able to identify every case in which there was no entry. Excluding the initial 41 questionable observations that were removed, no further observations showed a nonrandom pattern of missing data entries. Due to the large sample size of the study, slight departures for normality may be statistically significant (Kline, 2011). Based on guidelines recommended by Curran, West, and Finch (1997), any variable that had a skewness of absolute 3 or greater was considered to be severely skewed. Furthermore, any variable with a kurtosis of absolute 10 or greater was considered to be problematic. Two degree commitment items met the criteria for extreme skewness and kurtosis, and were noted as potential issues in the structural modeling phase. Preliminary Analysis of the Primary Dependent Variables Initial analysis of skewness and kurtosis of the primary dependent variables (degree commitment and specialty commitment) showed normality issues. Even though the data being left-skewed would indicate integer-valued transformations, common fractional transformations were selected as well. The transformations the researcher attempted were cubic, square, square root, cube root, and logarithmic. There was some indication that the cube transformation could be beneficial for the specialty commitment data, but the degree commitment data were far too skewed despite the transformation. The benefit of transforming the data in part or whole did not outweigh the need to keep the results meaningful, thus no transformations were used. Factor structure of Commitment. With regard to the three degree commitment items and the three specialty commitment items, there was reason to first determine the dimensionality of the six similar items. This was done by EFA and correlational analysis. An EFA using MLR and direct oblimin rotation extracted two factors. The degree commitment items loaded on the first factor, while the specialty commitment items loaded on the second factor. Of note, there was 81 little evidence of item-factor cross-loadings. Further, the factors had a very low correlation (r = .05, p < .05). Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient assumes that the two variables correlating will be continuous. Because the variables that were correlated were ordinal, it was more sensible to use an alternative estimate of correlation (i.e., polychoric correlation). Demographic Characteristics In order to present the context of the analyses, the demographic data of medical students who responded to the survey are presented in Table 2. Among the 1,486 participants, the representation of males to females was somewhat equivalent. The median age range was 23-25. As with the United States sample, the majority of respondents in the sample were Caucasian, Asian, and African American. Very few respondents were non-citizens. The most popular undergraduate major reported by participants was Biology. Respondents represented each year of medical school somewhat equally. Although specific differences among individuals of Hispanic descent were identified in accordance with the AAMC's (2011b) Matriculating Student Questionnaire, the total combined percentage of representation by Hispanic individuals in the sample was 4.3%. The demographics of the sample were somewhat representative of all United States medical students. The single major difference between the current sample and all United States medical students was the higher representation of Caucasians (73.4% compared to 59.0%) and lower representation of Asians (16.2% compared to 22.4%) and Hispanics (4.3% compared to 8.7%). The overall demographic similarity of the study to the national population of medical students adds support for the generalizability of the study's results. With regard to attention to the health care reform, participating medical students were asked \"In what ways have you obtained information about the Affordable Care Act and/or the ongoing health care reform?\" Respondents reported gaining information from the news media (N = 1,283; 86.3%), Internet resources (80.7%), medical school peers and faculty (54.9% and 42.9%, respectively), and social media (46.5%). 82 Table 2 Demographic Characteristics of the Sample and all United States Medical Students Sample United States Frequency Percent Frequency Percent Gender Male 732 49.3 43,633a 53.2 a Female 754 50.7 38,434 a 46.8 a Age in Years 18 to 20 1 .1 21 to 22 150 10.1 23 to 25 819 55.1 26 to 28 348 23.4 29 to 32 128 8.6 33 and older 40 2.7 Missing 2 .1 Ethnicity African American 79 5.3 5,630b 6.8 b American Indian 1 0.1 630 b .7 b Asian 241 16.2 18,449 b 22.4 b Native Hawaiian 3 .2 223 b 2.7 b Caucasian (White) 1,091 73.4 48,615 b 59.0 b Mexican 13 .9 2,017 b 2.4 b Puerto Rican 6 .4 1,742 b 2.1 b Cuban 5 .3 692 b 0.8 b Other Hispanic 40 2.7 2,774 b 3.4 b Missing 7 .5 1,560 b 1.9 b Undergraduate Major Biology 617 41.5 Chemistry 96 6.5 Human Sciences 40 2.7 Bio-Chemistry 134 9.0 Nutrition 19 1.3 Physics 12 0.8 Psychology 77 5.2 Other Science-related 316 21.3 Non-Science 175 11.8 Missing 6 1.5 Citizenship United States 1452 97.7 Other 32 2.2 Year in Medical Y1 376 25.3 82,067c 25.8 c Y2 424 28.5 80,244 c 25.2 c Y3 297 20.0 78,764 c 24.7 c Y4 351 23.6 77,378 c 24.3 c Other 38 2.6 83 Table 2 continued Demographic Characteristics of the Sample and all United States Medical Students Sample United States Frequency Percent Frequency Percent ACA and HCR Grand Rounds 240 16.2 Social Media 691 46.5 Legislator Mtgs. 92 6.2 Formal Class 388 26.1 News Media 1283 86.3 Internet Sources 1199 80.7 Special Interest 315 21.2 Medical School Faculty 637 42.9 Peers 816 54.9 a.

Development and Refinement of the HCRTS The original 55 item HCRTS (N = 111) resulted in a 4-factor solution of 30 items (25 were excluded; Goodin, 2012), three of which were reverse-scored. A total of 15 items were added to the 30 items in an attempt to balance the number of items in each subscale because the first subscale (reactance) was comprised of many more items than the other subscales. In order to do a preliminary test of the factor structure found by the Goodin's (2010) EFA (N = 111) and the validity of the parcels created based on the magnitude of factor loadings from EFA, a second EFA using the new data set was conducted. In beginning to answer the research questions and test their associated hypotheses, Research Question 1 and its associated hypothesis were evaluated before all others. Research Question 1 Is the hypothesized factor structure of the HCRTS replicated? Hypothesis 1.1 The factor structure of Goodin (2010; see Figure 1) will be supported by the data. Due to the large sample size of the entire data set, data were split into two approximately equal groups for cross-validation purposes to assess model fit of the HCRTS instrument. Using 84 SPSS, the entire data set was split into two, mutually-exclusive, randomly selected groups that each contained approximately 50% of the data. Sub-sample 1 included 749 observations while Sub-sample 2 contained 737 observations. An EFA of sub-sample 1 showed a 4-factor solution. The 4-factor solution was extracted using oblimin rotation and MLR estimation in MPlus. The smallest eigenvalue with a value greater than or equal to 1, belonging to the 4th extracted factor, was 1.39. An analysis of the associated scree plot showed support for a 3 or 4-factor solution. Furthermore, although MPlus supported a 4-factor solution, no items primarily loaded on the fourth factor. Therefore, the researcher deemed the 4-factor structure inappropriate. The researcher then inspected 1-factor, 2-factor, and 3-factor solutions. A 1-factor solution explained 53.96% of the variance in participants' responses. A 2-factor solution explained 60.03% of the variance in participants' responses (6.06% increase over th e 1-factor model). A 3-factor solution explained 64.479% of the variance in participants' responses (4.45 % increase over the 2-factor model). A 4-factor solution explained 67.78% of the variance in participants' responses (3.30% increase over the 3-factor model). Although the original study (Goodin, 2010; N = 111) showed a 4-factor solution, with augmentation of the instrument, as well as the different and substantially larger sub-sample (N = 749), deviations in EFA results are understandable. Although the 1-factor solution explained a moderate amount of variance in participants' responses (53.96%), it overlooks the more likely scenario that there is at least one more factor (e.g., 60.02% variance in participants' responses explained by the 2-factor structure). Thus, like the 4-factor structure, the 1-factor structure was deemed to be inappropriate. The 4-factor structure was also problematic in that it added only 3.30% of explained variance in participants' responses and no item primarily loaded on the 4th factor. Statistically, the data supported a 2 or 3-factor solution. Both solutions presented modest explanations of the variance, although neither provided an excellent degree of variance explained. Based on the item retention criteria that items must have a primary loading of .3 or higher on a single factor and no crossload of .3 or higher on other factors, 4 items were removed from the data set based on EFA findings. Items removed included 11, 23, 39, and 20. Item 11, for example, was \" I don't believe the reform will still be in effect by the time I finish medical school.\" It was removed because it did not load at .3 or above on any of the three factors. Of the 85 four items removed, one represented Outlook, one represented Reaction, and two represented Uncertainty. Thus, a 41 item version of the HCRTS was used for subsequent quantitative analyses. Model fit indicators and the CLE theory were employed to determine whether the 2 or 3- factor solution was more appropriate. The first step in the process was to compare the fit of the data to each factor structure. The model fit indices are shown in Table 3. The 3-factor model had improved fit indices compared to the 2-factor model on chi- square, RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR. It is noteworthy that the chi-square fit statistic is significant for both models. However, the significance is to be expected due to the large sub- sample size (N = 749). The second step in the process was to identify the main concepts being differentiated by the factors of both solutions. The first factor of the 2-factor structure was composed of 26 items (4, 35, 9, 30, 14, 34, 42, 31, 33, 5, 32, 38, 2, 22, 36, 43, 1, 6, 21, 8, 10, 29, 44, 3, 41, and 25) that differentiated participants on the concepts of negativity, pessimism, outlook, attitude, and judgment, with regard to how they felt about the health care reform. The highest loading item (25) on the first factor was \"I think the reform is a great step in the right direction for the United States' medical system \" ( = 1.00, where indicates factor loading ) and had a crossload on factor 2 ( = -0.07). Table 3 Model Comparison for EFA of the HCRTS Model Fit 2-factor 3-factor : Number of items equals 41. The second factor of the 2-factor structure was composed of 15 items (24, 27, 28, 12, 19, 7, 17, 37, 45, 13, 40, 18, 15, 26, and 16) that differentiated participants on the concepts of demotivation, uncertainty, upset plans, predicted negative role changes, and negative emotions. The highest loading item (28) on the second factor was \"Because of the reform, I aim to change 86 what I originally stated as my specialty preference \" ( = 0.77). As with factor 1 items, the crossload of this item ( = -0.16) on factor 1 was noted. The first factor of the 3-factor structure was composed of 26 items (4, 35, 9, 30, 14, 34, 42, 31, 33, 5, 32, 38, 2, 22, 36, 43, 1, 6, 21, 8, 10, 29, 44, 3, 41, and 25) that assessed participants on the concepts of negativity, fear, pessimism, uncertainty, and concern, with regard to how they felt about the health care reform. The highest loading item (25) on the first factor was \"I think the reform is a great step in the right direct ion for the United States' medical system\" ( = .98) and had crossloads on factors 2 and 3 ( = -.02 and = -.04, respectively). The second factor of the 3-factor structure was composed of 6 items (24, 27, 28, 12, 19, and 7) that differentiated participants on the concepts of perceived need to change personal goals, feeling that goals had been upset, and feelings of regret over their career choice. The highest loading item (24) on the factor was \"Because of the reform, I am less certain that I want to be a doctor\" ( = .72). The item had crossloads on factors 1 and 3 ( = .08 and = .11, respectively). With regard to the second factor of the 3-factor structure, it is important to discuss its emergence and choice of title. Six items loaded on the second factor of the HCRTS measurement model. The root phrases of the items, ordered by the strength of their loading, included: \"I am less certain that I want to be a doctor.\" (24) \"If I had known [the PPACA] was going to pass, I would have been more hesitant to enter medical school.\" (27) \"I aim to change what I originally stated as my specialty preference.\" (28) \"I want to serve people as a doctor no matter how the healthcare system changes.\" (12; reverse-scored) \"[T]he current changes in health care have upset my plans.\" (19) \"[M]y choice of specialty is likely to be altered.\" (7) The third factor of the 3-factor structure was composed of nine items (17, 37, 45, 13, 40, 18, 15, 26, and 16) that differentiated participants on the concepts of certainty about the future, beliefs that the health care system will remain stable, and feelings of peace about the reform. The 87 highest loading item on the factor was \"Because of the reform, I am less certain about what I will be expected to do as a doctor\" ( = -.75) and had crossloads on factors 1 and 2 ( = .02 and = .11, respectively). Due to the emphasis of each item on plans to react to the HCR by modification of goals, the second factor was entitled, Reaction, while the first factor retained the attributes of Outlook and the third factor retained the attributes of Uncertainty. The HCRTS instrument was not believed to be unidimensional, but rather multidimensional. The factors were all intercorrelated. Uncertainty was significantly correlated with Reaction ( r = .73, p < .001) and Outlook ( r = .77, p < .001), while Reaction was also significantly correlated with Optimism ( r = .70, p < .001). Furthermore, the intercorrelations among the factors were expected because all items were created to represent aspects of disturbance resulting from a critical life event. Whereas the 2- factor model represented delineations of Outlook (e.g., negativity; factor 1) and Uncertainty (e.g., negative emotionality; factor 2) regarding the health care reform and its future, the second factor was not theoretically and conceptually cohesive. The 3-factor model represented delineations of participants' outlook, reaction, and certainty regarding the health care reform and its future. Overall, the 3-factor model had fewer large (greater than .3) crossloadings and, more importantly, made greater theoretical and conceptual sense. The Meaning-making items (e.g., \"I feel more positively about the reform if I think about it as a pivotal point in United States medicine\") of the 4-factor structure from Goodin's (2010) study appeared to represent the Outlook factor (i.e., positivity or negativity toward the HCR) rather than the frequency of interpretation of the HCR to ease cognitive disequilibrium, as previously believed by Goodin. All further discussion of the HCRTS in the current study incorporates a 3-factor solution, where the subscales represent Outlook (e.g., positivity/negativity), Reaction (e.g., [dis]belief that personal goals should change), and Uncertainty (e.g., [dis]belief that the health care system will remain stable through the reform). The three subscales align with Inglehart's (1991) CLE theory. Inglehart stipulated that reactance was evidence of a CLE. Reactance would be stronger or weaker, according to Inglehart, based on whether an event (e.g., the HCR) was congruent with one's attitudes, beliefs, and goals. Therefore, the three subscales supply a measure of participants' attitudes about the reform (Outlook), their beliefs about the effects the reform will have generally (Uncertainty), and their level of activated reaction (e.g., the need to change specialties; Reaction). 88 After the EFA of the new data set provided a 3-factor structure, it was appropriate to confirm that the 3-factor structure was supported by a CFA of the second sub-sample. Testing of the measurement model for the HCRTS was conducted through CFA. CFA is used to test the relationships among latent variables and their indicators (i.e., items). Each item was entered into MPlus syntax by respective construct for analysis of model fit. For example, all of the Outlook items were entered into the analysis under the Outlook latent variable. All HCRTS constructs were treated as continuous variables rather than categorical due to all HCRTS items being measured on a Likert scale with six scale points (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2010). Thus, MLR was used for the measurement model and later for the SEM modeling. Common fit statistics (chi-square test of model fit, RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR) were used to evaluate model fit. All fit indicators were evaluated as a group to determine the overall fit of the model to the data. Initially, the chi-square statistic was evaluated. A non-significant chi- square statistic is desired, meaning that the model is not significantly different from the data it represents. More specifically, the null hypothesis of the chi-square test is that the original and model-estimated covariance matrices are equivalent. When the chi-square statistic is nonsignificant, one cannot reject the null hypothesis and accept that the model is a good fit to the data. However, according to Hoelter (1983) and Kline (2011), the chi-square statistic is highly influenced by large sample sizes and models with a large number of indicators, such that it is likely to be significant with samples of 400 or more observations. With respect to the large size of sub-sample 2 (N = 737), the 2 was expected to be significant. Based on Kline's advice, other measures of fit were utilized to better evaluate the model fit. Alternative fit indices include the aforementioned RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR. Initial assessment of the model of the instrument indicated the model fit moderately well to the data (2(776) = 3177.835, p < .001; RMSEA SRMR = .052). Chi- square was significant at the p < .001 level, although this indicator was not a concern due to the large sample size. A variety of tests were performed to identify options that might improve the model. Items with high standardized residuals (e.g., greater than 2.56; Hoyle, 1995) are often removed to support the convergence validity of the items. High standardized residuals were evaluated in conjunction with other indicators of possibly problematic items. Thus, with a focus on data retention when appropriate, no items were removed due to high standardized residuals alone. 89 Next, standardized factor loadings were evaluated for significance. All standardized factor loadings for items on the three subscales were significant (p < .001). R2 values (see Table 4) show the amount of variance in each item explained by the latent factor, such that an R2 value of .74 indicates that the factor explains 74.1% of the variance in responses to the item. Low R2 values would also present evidence of problematic items or poor model fit. However, all but six of the original 41 HCRTS items on the HCRTS had R2 values greater than 0.50, with the lowest being 0.13. Additionally, Figure 5 provides the standardized correlations among the latent variables: Outlook, Reaction, and Uncertainty, illustrating that there is a moderately strong correlation among each of the constructs. Descriptive Data of Retained HCRTS Items Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, skew, and kurtosis) were used to evaluate the retained HCRTS subscale items. The results are presented in Table 4. The items ranged from a score of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The HCRTS subscale items were inspected to determine if they were approximately normally distributed. Some skewness and kurtosis were noted, although no items fell outside of the absolute value thresholds of 2 (skewness) and 7 (kurtosis). The mean values of the indicators were not too dissimilar. Means ranged from 2.56 to 4.87 for the Outlook measurement, from 1.645 to 3.867 on the Reaction subscale, and from 3.48 to 4.48 on the Uncertainty subscale. Correlation of the HCRTS Items Using only the observations from the second sub-sample, the researcher analyzed the interrelationships among the HCRTS items for significant associations, using a correlation matrix. Pearson's product moment statistics were used to represent the relationships between items. Table 5 presents these findings. Only two correlations among Outlook subscale items were not significant, with the strongest correlation between O25 and O4 ( r = .89, p < .001). The weakest correlation was the relationship between O41 and O11 ( r = .003, p = .913).

All Reaction items were significantly correlated, with the strongest correlation between R24 and R27 ( r = .75, p < .001) and the weakest correlation between R7 and R12 ( r = .31, p <.001). Finally, all Uncertainty items were significantly correlated, with the strongest correlation between U37 and U45 ( r = .69, p < .001) and the weakest correlation between U26 and U16 ( r = .23 , p < .001). Parceling Using the 3-factor solution, parcels were created based on the new (2012, subsample 2 ) data set. The previously discussed parceling method proposed by Little et al. (2002) was used to create the parcels (see Parceling subsection earlier in Method). W here Lambda () denotes an item's loading on a given subscale and the subscripted numbers represent the order of the item's loading based on the weight of said loading, , , ... , illustrates the 26 items of the Outlook subscale packeted into five parcels where Parcel 1 would include , , , , , . The same logic of making balanced parcels based on factor loadings was used with the Reaction and Uncertainty subscales. For the first factor (Outlook subscale; 26 items), five parcels were created, such that four parcels contained five items and one parcel contained six items. Nasser-Abu and Wisenbaker (2006) remarked that parcels should contain 4-6 items. Outlook Parcel 1 contained items 25, 35, 34, 1, and 2 (5 items). Outlook Parcel 2 contained items 4, 31, 22, 8, and 10 (5 items). Outlook Parcel 3 contained items 32, 33, 14, 21, and 44 (5 items). Outlook Parcel 4 contained items 38, 43, 36, 9, and 3 (5 items). Outlook Parcel 5 contained items 30, 5, 42, 6, 29, and 41 (6 items). For the second factor (Reaction subscale; 6 items), two parcels were created. Due to the small number of items in the Reaction subscale, both parcels contained only three items. Reaction Parcel 1 contained items 27, 28, and 7 (3 items). Reaction Parcel 2 contained items 24, 19, and 12 (3 items). For the third factor (Uncertainty subscale; 9 items), two parcels were created, such that one parcel contained five items and the other contained four items. Uncertainty Parcel 1 (5 items) contained items 18, 45, 37, 40, and 16. Uncertainty Parcel 2 (4 items) contained items 15, 17, 13, and 26. 95 Summary of Research Question 1 For the first research question \"Is the hypothesized factor structure of the HCRTS replicated?,\" the hypothesis (H 1.1) was that the 4-factor structure of Goodin (2010; see Figure 1 ) would be replicated in the current data. The findings of the EFA of the new data set (N = 1,486; i.e., a 3-factor model), depicted in Figure 6, indicated that the hypothesis was rejected. Figure 6. Revised Factor Structure of the HCRTS As previously stated, all hypotheses for research questions 2 through 5 were based on the assumption that H 1.1 would be confirmed. The following section discusses research questions and associated hypotheses that required adjustment based on the empirical findings of the factor structure, noting that the \"Reactance\" and \"Meaning-making\" subscales have been removed, while the \"Reaction\" subscale has been added. All hypotheses for variables recovered in the EFA on the current data set remain ed the same (see previously discussed research questions). \"Reactance\" was a broad subscale, which constituted evidence of uncertainty (e.g., upset/excitement) in reaction to the health care reform. Whereas Reactance encompassed both passive and active cognitions of response to the health care reform, the new Reaction subscale is a more specific, clearly-defined re-interpretation of Reactance and retains similar characteristics. Reaction items are based on feelings of uncertainty, but more clearly measure an activating desire (or lack thereof) to react or change one's goals in response to the health care reform. Simply put, Reactance included active and passive cognitions of response to the HCR, but Reaction emphasizes active cognitions. Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey Outlook Reaction Uncertainty 96 The revised hypotheses are depicted in Figure 7 below. For each subsequent research question and its associated hypotheses, Figure 7 may serve as a visual reference. The figure shows all theoretically relevant pathways. Pathways associated with \"Reaction\" acquired the predicted relationships previously associated with \"Reactance.\" Those pathways associated with \"Meaning-making\" were removed. The order in which revised hypotheses are discussed reflects the amount of variance explained by each in the revised factor structure (largest to smallest). Figure 7. Revised SEM Model with Revised Hypotheses. Note : The model represents all theoretically relevant pathways. Based on the revised factor structure, the wording of Research Questions 2-5 and associated hypotheses was revised to replace a 4-factor structure with a 3-factor structure, to replace \"Reactance\" with \"Reaction,\" to remove the variable \"Meaning-making,\" and to represent the multidimensional nature of the \"Commitment\" items by specifying \"Degree Commitment\" and \"Specialty Commitment.\" Thus, the remaining research questions and associated hypotheses after revisions were modified accordingly. Research Question 2 asked, \"What is the percentage of the variance in Role Ambiguity explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year?\" Hypotheses were as follows: 97 Hypothesis 2.1 : Reaction is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA. Hypothesis 2.2 : Uncertainty is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA. Research Question 3 asked, \"What is the percentage of the variance in Self-efficacy explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year? \" Associated hypotheses were as follows: Hypothesis 3.1 : Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. Hypothesis 3.2 : Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. Hypothesis 3.3 : Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE. Hypothesis 3.4 : Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with SE. Research Question 4 asked, \"What is the percentage of the variance in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy? Associated hypotheses were as follows: Hypothesis 4.1.1 : RA is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment. Hypothesis 4.1.2 : RA is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment. Hypothesis 4.2.1 : SE is hypothesized to be positively associated with Degre e Commitment. Hypothesis 4.2.2 : SE is hypothesized to be positively associated with Specialty Commitment. Research Question 5 asked, \"What is the percentage of the variance in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables? \" Associated hypotheses were as follows: Hypothesis 5.1.1 : Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment. Hypothesis 5.1.2 : Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment. 98 Hypothesis 5.2.1 : Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment. Hypothesis 5.2.2 : Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment. Hypothesis 5.3.1 : Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment. Hypothesis 5.3.2 : Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment. Hypothesis 5.4.1 : Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with Degree Commitment. Hypothesis 5.4.2 : Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with Specialty Commitment. Hypothesis 5.5.1 : RA is hypothesized to remain negatively associated with Degree Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. Hypothesis 5.5.2 : RA is hypothesized to remain negatively associated with Specialty Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. Hypothesis 5.6.1 : SE is hypothesized to remain positively associated with Degree Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. Hypothesis 5.6.2 : SE is hypothesized to remain positively associated with Specialty Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model. Reliability of the Measures The instrument items to be used in the structural equation model were assessed for internal consistency using the Cronbach's alpha reliability statistic . Thresholds of acceptable reliability are purpose-dependant. Although alpha statistics lower than .50 have questionable reliability for research purposes (Kline, 2011), the Cronba ch's alpha of .70 is considered to be \"adequate\" (p. 70). Values above .80 are \"very good,\" while values above .90 are \"excellent.\" The reliability of the items for the IVs, Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy, and DVs, Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment were suitable for continued use (see Table 6 ). The removal of a single RA item would improve the reliability to .92 (up from .91). The removal of a single SE item would improve the SE reliability to .92 (up from .91). For the Commitment 99 variables, \"Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted\" did not indicate that removal of any item(s) would improve the reliability. In all cases where the subscale reliability would be increased by deletion of an item, the increase was small enough that it did not warrant deletion of the item. Alphas for Outlook, Reaction, and Uncertainty subscales were computed using reliability analysis. Furthermore, \"Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted\" was evaluated for all items. In most of the cases, there was a very slight decrease in subscale reliability if an item were to be deleted. By eliminating an item, this result would be expected, so these items posit no concern. In all cases where the subscale reliability would be increased by deletion of an item, said increase was small enough that it did not warrant deletion of the item. In the Outlook subscale, removal of Table 6 Descriptive Statistics of the Instruments and Year Percentages Variable Mean SD Range Alpha Outlook 3.21 1.27 1-6 0.98 Reaction Y3 20.00 - - - Y4 23.60 - - - N = 1,486 Note : The value in the mean column of the nominal variable Year indicates percentages of each within the total sample size. Missing data on Year accounts for 2.6 percent. items (number of items = 2) would have increased the alpha coefficient slightly (.979 up from .977), depending on the item. In the Reaction subscale, removal of a single item (number of items = 1) would have increased the alpha coefficient to .89 (.893 up from .891). In the Uncertainty subscale, removal of an item (number of items = 1) would have increased the alpha coefficient to .93 (.925 up from .923). 100 Model Testing In order to answer Research Questions 2-5 (see Figure 4), structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted using robust maximum-likelihood (MLR) estimation procedures with the iterations set at 1000 and the convergence of the data set at .00005. The procedure for SEM is similar to the aforementioned procedures for CFA (i.e., testing the HCRTS measurement model). The full model was tested using the same fit indices (chi- square [2] , RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR). Any path that was not significant at the .05 alpha level was considered for elimination from the model. The results of path analysis with the proposed SEM model are presented in Table 7 and Figure 8. Similarly to testing the measurement model of the HCRTS instrument, SEM assesses model fit using 2, RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and SRMR with the same criteria for model f it. The results of testing the structural model yielded a reasonable fit, 2(463) = 2477.001, p < .001, RMSEA = .054, CFI = .941, TLI = .933, and SRMR = .086. Table 7 shows the results of all hypothesized and exploratory paths in the Full Model. Figure 8 shows all possible paths and indicates significant effects. Research Question 2 With regard to Research Question 2 (What is the percentage of the variance in Role Ambiguity explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year?), the SEM represent ed Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, Outlook, and Year as exogenous, independent predictor variables of the endogenous, dependent variable, Role Ambiguity. The hypothesized paths were RA on Reactance and RA on Uncertainty. The researcher obtain ed an R-squared coefficient of determination, R2, in answer to Research Question 2. The variance in RA explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year was 6.3% ( p < .001). One of the two hypotheses associated with Research Question 2 was supported. Hypothesis 2.1 (Reaction is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA) was supported (b* = 0.24, p < .001, where b* denotes standardized path coefficients). Hypothesis 2.2 (Uncertainty is hypothesized to be positively associated with RA) was not supported ( b* = -0.07, p = .366). 101 Table 7 Full Model: Unstandardized, Standardized, Standard Errors and Significance Levels Parameter Estimate Unstandardized (S.E.)

Research Question 3 With regard to Research Question 3 (What is the percentage of the variance in Self- efficacy explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year?), the SEM represented Reactance, Meaning-making, Uncertainty, Outlook, and Year as exogenous, independent predictor variables of the endogenous, dependent variable, Self-efficacy. The hypothesized paths 102 were SE on Reactance, SE on Certainty, SE on Outlook, and SE on Year. The researcher obtained an R2 in answer to Research Question 3. The variance in SE explained by Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year was 3.0% (p < .05). One of the four hypotheses associated with Research Question 3 was supported. Hypothesis 3.1 (Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE) was not supported, although the relationship was significant in the unpredicted direction ( b* = 0.11, p < .05). Hypothesis 3.2 (Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE) was supported (b* = -0.25, p < .001). Hypothesis 3.3 (Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with SE) was not supported ( b* = 0.07, p = .352). Hypothesis 3.4 (Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with SE) was not supported (YR2 b = -0.03, p = .425; YR3 b = -0.06 ; p = .280; YR4 b = -0.03, p = .580, where b denotes unstandardized path coefficients ). Research Question 4 With regard to Research Question 4 (What is the percentage of the variance in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy?), the SEM represent ed Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy as exogenous, independent predictor variables of the endogenous, dependent variable, Commitment. The hypothesized paths were Commitment by RA and Commitment by SE. After fixing all exogenous variable path coefficients to zero, the researcher obtain ed an R2 in answer to Research Question 4. The variance in Degree Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy was 0.7% ( p = .177). The combined variance in Specialty Commitment explained by Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy was 4.9% ( p < .001). Three of the four hypotheses associated with Research Question 4 were supported. With regard to the relationship of RA and Commitment, Hypothesis 4.1.1 (RA is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment) was supported (b* = -0.07, p < .05). Similarly, Hypothesis 4.1.2 (RA is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment) was supported ( b* = -0.16, p < .001). With regard to the relation of SE and Commitment, Hypothesis 4.2.1 (SE is hypothesized to be positively associated with Degree Commitment) was not supported ( b* = 0.04, p =.166). However, Hypothesis 4.2.2 (SE is hypothesized to be positively associated with Specialty Commitment) was supported ( b* = 0.15, p < .001). 103 Research Question 5 With regard to Research Question 5 (What is the percentage of the variance in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables?), the SEM represent ed Reactance, Uncertainty, Outlook, Year, Role Ambiguity, and Self-efficacy as exogenous (excepting indirect paths of RA and SE), independent predictor variables of the endogenous, dependent variable, Commitment. The hypothesized paths were Commitment on Reactance, Commitment on Uncertainty, Commitment on Outlook, Commitment on Year, Commitment on RA, and Commitment on SE. The researcher obtain ed an R2 in answer to Research Question 5. Figure 8. SEM Model with all Paths and Standardized Path Coefficients. Note : All significant paths are designated by a solid line. Nonsignificant paths are designated by a dashed line. Year 1 was designated as the reference year to which other years were compared. The correlation between degree commitment and specialty commitment was significant but very small ( r = 0.05, p < .05). 104 The combined variance in Degree Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables (i.e., Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, Year, SE, and RA) is 3.9% ( p = .012). The combined variance in Specialty Commitment explained directly and indirectly by all predictor variables was 29.1% ( p < .001). Five of the twelve hypotheses associated with Research Question 5 were supported. With regard to the relation of Outlook and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.1.1 (Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment) was not supported for Degree Commitment ( b* = 0.02, p = .687). Hypothesis 5.1.2 (Outlook is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment) was also not supported, although the relationship was significant in the unpredicted direction ( b* = 0.24, p < .001). With regard to the relationship of Reaction and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.2.1 (Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment) was supported (b* = -0.26, p < .001). Similarly, Hypothesis 5.2.2 (Reaction is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment ) was supported ( b* = -0.16, p = .001). With regard to the relationship of Uncertainty and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.3.1 (Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Degree Commitment) was not supported, although the relationship was significant in the unpredicted direction (b* = 0.15, p < .05). However, Hypothesis 5.3.2 (Uncertainty is hypothesized to be negatively associated with Specialty Commitment) was not supported ( b* = -0.08, p = .179). With regard to the relationship of Year and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.4.1 (Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with Degree Commitment) was not supported (YR2 b = 0.05, p = .397; YR3 b = 0.06, p = .398; YR4 b = 0.10, p = .084). Hypothesis 5.4.2 (Year is hypothesized to be positively associated with Specialty Commitment) was partially supported, although the difference in SC for Y2 medical students was not significantly different from Y1 students (YR2 b = 0.11, p = .090). However, SC for Y3 and 4 medical students was significantly different from Y1 students (YR3 b = 0.40, p < .001; YR4 b = 1.13, p < .001). With regard to the relationship of RA and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.5.1 (RA is hypothesized to remain negatively associated with Degree Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model) was not supported ( b* = -0.05, p = .126). However, Hypothesis 5.5.2 (RA is hypothesized to remain negatively associated with Specialty Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model) was supported ( b* = -0.16, p < .001). 105 With regard to the relationship of SE and Commitment, Hypothesis 5.6.1 (SE is hypothesized to remain positively associated with Degree Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model) was not supported ( b* = 0.02, p = .455). However, Hypothesis 5.6.2 (SE is hypothesized to remain positively associated with Specialty Commitment when the additional five paths are added to the model) was supported ( b* = 0.13, p < .001). Additional Findings The \"sociopolitical views\" section of the survey was considered more personal, although its questions were believed to provide some small understanding with regard to the influence of social and political views on medical students' survey responses. This section of the survey was placed last and emphasized as being optional. Students were assured that if they chose not to answer the sociopolitical questions, they would qualify as having fully completed the survey. A total of 1,198 (80.6%) chose to answer the optional \"sociopolitical views\" section, located at the end of the survey. In terms of demographics, the subsample of medical students that chose to report their sociopolitical views was not dissimilar to the full sample. Based on frequencies, students who responded to these items differed from the full sample no more than 3 percentage points on representation in all demographic groups: medical school, gender, age, year in medical school, citizenship, ethnicity, and undergraduate major. Most students reported alignment with the Democratic Party (N = 602; 40.5%) or the Republican Party (N = 304; 20.5%). Those who marked \"Other\" specified other political orientations such as Independent, Moderate, Communist, Socialist, States Rights, Individual/Issue-based, or Unaligned/Unaffiliated/None, or reported that they were a minor or non-citizen. The results are reported in Table 8. In the 2008 Presidential Election, most student respondents voted for Obama (47.4%) or McCain (24.7%). When asked to what extent the health care reform had played a role in their voting choice in 2008 (1 = Not at All, 10 = A Great Amount), the mean answer was 5.41 (SD = 2.91). Those who marked \"Other\" with regard to their voting choice specified that they voted for such candidates as Ron Paul, Jill Stein, Mitt Romney, or a \"Write In,\" or reported that they were a minor, non-citizen, or chose not to vote. Most participants (N=1,168; 78.6%) took the MEDS survey just prior to the results of the presidential election of 2012, while others (N = 318; 21.4%) participated after President Obama's re-election was announced on November 6, 2012 at approximately 11:20pm EST. Depending on 106 the date and time of the respondent's survey participation, medical students reported their intended voting choice or final voting choice for Obama (N = 672; 45.2%) or for Romney (N = 387; 26.0%) as the President of the United States.

When asked about their current level of comfort with the Affordable Care Act / Health Care Reform of 2010 on a scale from (1 = Very uncomfortable; 10 = Very comfortable), the mean participant response was 5.40 (SD = 2.56). When asked what extent the health care reform would affect (had affected) in their voting choice (1 = Not at all; 10 = A great amount), the mean participant response was 6.98 (SD = 2.64 ). Theoretical Evaluation With regard to an overarching question of whether medical students in the study were experiencing the HCR as a CLE, a preliminary analysis was used to make a general evaluation of medical students' disturbance by the HCR. Outlook subscale means greater than 4.5 or less than 2.5, Reaction means greater than 3.5, and Uncertainty means greater than 3 .5 were considered, for exploratory purposes, to be criteria suggesting that students experienced disturbance and, thus, perceived the HCR as a CLE. Based on the criteria, 112 (7.5%) medical student participants met the criteria for \"full\" disturbance. Thus, based on these criteria, only a small percentage of students had an overall (on all 3 subscales) disturbance to the HCR. In contrast, 1,296 (87.2 %) medical students met the criteria for a \"partial\" disturbance, exhibiting disturbance on at least one subscale. With regard to specific subscales, the percentages of students indicating disturbance varied by subscale. The criteria for disturbance was met by participants' on Outlook (N = 830 ; 55.9%), Reaction (178 ; 12.0%), and Uncertainty (850 ; 57.2%). With a lack of thresholds to inform criteria regarding disturbance, it should be emphasized that the dichotomous grouping of participants into \"perceived disturbance\" and \"no disturbance\" is rather arbitrary without theoretical framework to support it. For instance, a more liberal or conservative set of criteria (e.g., Reaction thresholds greater than .5) for disturbance could substantially change the percentage of students that meet the criteria. 108 CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSION The primary purpose of this study was to understand medical students' perceptions of the HCR as a possible CLE in their life course and the impact of said perceptions on commitment to their medical career goals. Secondly, this study examined how medical students' perceptions of the HCR were related to Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy, and how RA and SE added to understanding of medical career goals. The primary measure utilized in this study was the Health Care Reform Thoughts Survey (HCRTS), which was created for this study. The HCRTS was used to measure medical students' perceptions (Outlook, Reaction, and Uncertainty) toward the health care reform with respect to their medical career goals. The HCRTS was founded on the literature of Critical Life Events Theory (Inglehart, 1991), with the concept of critical life event \"reactance\" (i.e., disturbance) to the HCR applied to statements about medical student goals. This chapter provides a brief summary of the research results, which include discussion of the findings as they relate to each research question. Additional findings are also summarized and discussed. Furthermore, a review of study limitations and implications is presented. Prior to discussion of the research questions and their associated hypotheses, the main findings are summarized in the following paragraph. The main findings of the study all involved medical students' perceptions of the HCR, and how the activating component (i.e., Reaction) of those perceptions predicted RA, SE, and Specialty Commitment. First, measurement modeling of the HCRTS instrument resulted in a 3- factor solution with a marginal fit. Secondly, students in Y3 had significantly more RA than students in all other years. Furthermore, both RA and SE were found to be significantly associated with Specialty Commitment. Finally, in the SEM, all predictors (Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, Year, SE, and RA) were found to explain a significant amount of the variance in Specialty Commitment. Research Question 1 The 4-factor structure of Goodin's (2010) HCRTS was not replicated. However, using cross-validation to perform a 2-step fit of the measurement model for the instrument, an EFA of 109 a randomly-selected subsample of the current data set (N = 749) suggested a 3-factor structure for the HCRTS items that was supported in the second randomly-selected subsample by CFA. The measurement model of the HCRTS showed acceptable model fit. All research questions and associated hypotheses were revised with respect to the restructured measurement model of the HCRTS and the bi-dimensional nature of the dependent variable \"Commitment.\" The original HCRTS had included a fourth factor, \"Meaning-Making,\" which included items such as \"I feel better about the health care reform by thinking about it as the first step in a lengthy process.\" The much larger, more diverse, current data set did not support the loading of those items on their own individual factor. Rather, they were grouped with items that described a positive or negative attitude or feeling about the HCR and/or its future. Hence, it appeared that, rather than being evidence of medical students using reframing techniques to feel more positively or negatively about the HCR, respondents were answering strictly based on the direction (positive or negative) of the statement about the HCR. The \"Meaning-Making\" items did not represent their originally intended purpose of identifying the extent to which cognitive techniques were being employed to assuage cognitive disequilibrium about the HCR. Rather, those items represented variance in optimism and pessimism. This does not deny or confirm that medical students are viewing the HCR as a CLE or that they are experiencing cognitive disequilibrium. Students were normally distributed in their ratings of Outlook and Uncertainty, although their Reaction ratings were somewhat right-skewed. In other words, students varied normally with regard to Outlook and Uncertainty ratings, but most students had low ratings on Reaction items. With regard to experiencing the HCR as a CLE, many students reported high Outlook (i.e., high pessimism about the HCR), high Reaction (i.e., greater number of plans to change career goals), and/or high Uncertainty (i.e., Uncertain ty about the future of the HCR), indicating that for the HCR was perceived as a CLE for many students. High ratings on all 3 subscales represent indications of greater disturbance, upset, and cognitive disequilibrium about the HCR, while low ratings imply lower disturbance, upset, and cognitive disequilibrium. With regard to the HCR as a CLE, Outlook may be an antecedent, or moderator, of cognitive disequilibrium, Uncertainty is a measure of cognitive disequilibrium itself, and Reaction is evidence of actions being taken to alleviate cognitive disequilibrium. Outlook, Reaction, and Uncertainty as 110 indicators of a CLE align with Inglehart's (1991) CLE Theory and the process of cognitively reacting to a CLE. Outlook items (e.g., \"I think the reform is a great step in the right direction for the United States' medical system\" [Reverse-scored]) and Uncertainty items (e.g., \"Because of the reform, I am less certain about what I will be expected to do as a doctor\") include statements that indicate one's degree of pessimism and uncertainty about expectations, respectively. In contrast, the six items of the second factor all indicate cognitions of uncertainty that are tied more directly to specific career goals (e.g., specialty choice). The six items on factor two ask students to rate their agreement with their certainty about becoming a doctor, regret over career choice, plan to change specialty, resilience of their career choice, and feelings that one's plans have been upset. Uncertainty items focus on one's degree of certainty about the future. Yet, humans live with uncertainty every day. The effects of uncertainty vary by person and situation. Overall, humans are unable or have no choice but to live with some uncertainties (e.g., anxiety). Other uncertainties, for various reasons (e.g., confusion that inhibits goals) may \"require\" action on the part of an individual to find stability within the uncertainty or remove the uncertainty (Inglehart, 1991). The Uncertainty subscale is meant to represent feelings of uncertainty that are more general, ambiguous, and do not require management. Because Uncertainty items may be uncomfortable, but do not require action on the part of the individual, they are considered non-activating. Factor 2 was named \"Reaction\" because its items represent uncertainty that caused reaction (i.e., uncertainty that individuals felt a need to manage). Such items indicated that the uncertainty was activating for the individual, such that rather than live with the uncertainty, they recognize that their goals or plans have been upset (i.e., blocked). Individuals who give high ratings to Reaction items recognize the blockage of their goals and state that they are likely to modify their goals toward more certain and stable trajectories. To clarify the meanings of ratings on each of the three subscales, it should be noted that overall ratings on each subscale, when high, represent more overall reactance, the most basic indicator that, for certain individuals, the event in question (i.e., the HCR) is meeting the criteria of a CLE (Inglehart, 1991). In other words, high ratings on the subscales, overall, indicate that a participant's life has been disrupted by the HCR. For Outlook and its items, high ratings indicate that the medical student feels more negatively or pessimistic about the HCR and its future. It 111 should be emphasized that Outlook statements measure a continuum of positivity to negativity toward the HCR. In other words, disturbance resulting from a CLE is indicated by either positive or negative emotions (Inglehart, 1991), although it may be less apparent that a person who is excited (i.e., positive feelings; e.g., having a baby) about an event may be experiencing the event as a CLE. Unlike Uncertainty and Reaction, low Outlook scores in addition to high scores indicate reactance because disruption caused by a CLE could be met with fear and negativity or enthusiasm and positivity according to Inglehart. For Reaction and Uncertainty, only high scores are evidence of reactance (i.e., a CLE). For Uncertainty, high ratings indicate that the medical student has less clarity and more uncertainty about the future of the HCR and their place within the medical field. For Reaction, high ratings indicate that the medical student experiences the HCR with stronger feelings of upset goal-strivings and of a perceived need to modify goals to remove or diminish uncertainty. Research Question 2 Whereas the variance explained in medical students' Role Ambiguity ratings by their Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty and Year ratings was low in magnitude, it was statistically significant. Although medical students reported a moderate amount of RA, it is apparent that many other variables must play a role in determining each students' level of RA. Although not included in the current study, research by Jackson and Schuler (1985) discussed individual Tolerance of Ambiguity (TOA), a measure of a trait-like characteristic of an individual's ability to withstand ambiguous situations or events without anxiety or upset. TOA was said to have a moderating effect on RA by explaining how people perceive stress differently. Perhaps a measure of medical students' levels of TOA could explain more variance in medical students' RA in future research. Another possible antecedent of RA is autonomy in the form of participation. Schuler (1980) emphasized that the power to influence decision-making reduced RA. Therefore, by having more influence and investment in the system within which they play a role, individuals may better understand what is expected of them or be more comfortable when there is ambiguity. Social support may also play a role in explaining RA variance. Ganster, Fusilier, and Mayers (1986) found that perceptions of community and peer support could decrease RA. Furthermore, role overload has been shown to decrease RA (Parasuraman & Alutto, 1984). Understanding role 112 overload, along with TOA, participation in decision-making, and social support may explain greater variance in RA. The significant positive association between Reaction and RA was predicted. Medical students who believed that the HCR would require a change in their career goals were more likely to feel uncertain about their daily roles and duties as a medical student. Perhaps medical students' perceived need to change career goals (i.e., Reaction) had an \"in the present\" effect on medical students' clarity regarding their daily identity and responsibilities as a medical student. In other words, a blocked future goal may have created uncertainty regarding meeting the present responsibilities of a medical student. There was no relationship between Uncertainty and RA, although a positive relationship was hypothesized. Medical students who are experiencing non-activating uncertainty do not vary significantly in their uncertain ty about daily roles and duties as a medical student. The lack of association between Uncertainty and RA may be due to the unsupported belief of the researcher that feelings of uncertainty about the future would predict feelings of uncertainty in the present. Perhaps, since Uncertainty was specific to the HCR, the overall degree of uncertainty about the future was not fully represented. Thus, it could be that the future uncertainty about the HCR without inclusion of other future cognitions (certain or uncertain; e.g., marriage, death, taxes) was not a significant predictor of RA. Another explanation of the lack of association between Uncertainty and RA is that RA could be unaffected by perception (i.e., future uncertainty), such that only actual changes in the clarity of one's current role will influence RA. For instance, some specialties are likely to have more or less role ambiguity than others. RA is likely to vary by medical school and specific faculty members. Because RA is not a variable discussed in CLE literature (Inglehart, 1991), the lack of relationship between Uncertainty and RA does not undermine the plausibility of HCR as a CLE. Although Inglehart's conceptualization of a CLE makes no specific connection between CLE disturbance and RA, the researcher believed that there would be an association but was not supported by the current study. It is most likely that the somewhat strict role delineations of medical students make their RA resilient to CLEs. However, other populations may evidence association of CLE disturbance and RA. There was a significant relationship between Year and RA for students in Y3, although there was no hypothesized relationship between the two variables (see Table 7 and Figure 8). The relationship of medical students' Year and RA ratings for Y3 students suggest that students 113 who in Y3 were likely to rate RA items higher than students in other years of medical school. In other words, medical students in their third year were more likely to feel uncertain about their daily roles and duties as a medical student. The normal progression of the medical student discussed in Chapter 1 yields understanding of this association. After primarily spending the first two years of medical school in classrooms, the third year of medical school places students in clerkships (i.e., clinical education), wherein the focus of their role changes due to greater emphasis on application of the skills and knowledge gained from the first two years within a clinical setting. In some cases, Y3 clerkships may require students to move to a new location for their clinical training, thus removing them from a familiar physical environment (i.e., location). Similarly, with regard to academics, the clerkship experience may place the student in \"unfamiliar territory,\" much different than the test-oriented class environments of the majority of their previous education. The change in the characteristics of the student role may lead to uncertainty for the Y3 student as their responsibilities have changed and require acclimation. However, it is noteworthy that Y4 students did not differ in RA from Y1 and Y2 students. Perhaps by Year 4, students have become accustomed to the change in role associated with the applied focus of their studies and the RA levels that had been higher in Y3 have returned to previous levels. Research Question 3 The variance explained in medical students' Self-efficacy ratings by their Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty and Year ratings was statistically significant, although it was low in magnitude. Although medical students reported a moderate amount of SE, as with RA, it is apparent that many other variables must play a role in determining each students' level of SE. Bandura (1977a) explained that self-efficacy was built upon mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, social persuasion, and physiological interpretation. In order to better understand medical students' self-efficacy, future research might benefit from including questions regarding students' preparation for medical school and its tasks (i.e., mastery experiences). Therefore, based primarily on Bandura's Social Cognitive theory, greater variance in SE may be explained in future studies by the inclusion of questions regarding experience in healthcare-related tasks and experience (mastery experience), success in other relevant tasks (e.g., high school), number of doctors known (vicarious experience), family and community degree of support (social 114 encouragement), a successful history within medical school at present (inertia), optimism about challenges, and a calling to the medical field as seen in research by Goodin et al. (2013). The significant positive association between Outlook and SE was predicted to be in the opposite direction based on CLE theory and Social Cognitive Theory. Specifically, those who feel more pessimistically about the HCR were believed to be more likely to have lower SE relative to their peers. Students who had a negative perception of the HCR and its future were more likely to feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals. This finding requires further investigation. Perhaps the association between negativity toward the HCR and higher self-efficacy could be explained by students' reasons for entering the field of medicine. For instance, Deci and Ryan (1995) found that individuals vary in the extent to which they do things because of intrinsic motivations (i.e., self-fulfillment, enjoyment) or extrinsic motivations (e.g., money, social prestige, parental pressure). It is possible that intrinsically motivated medical students would be more likely to enter primary care specialties, such that their SE would remain stable or increase if the HCR were to promote those specialties, regardless of high Outlook (pessimism). In contrast, extrinsically motivated students may believe the HCR will decrease their future salary and autonomy. Their Outlook views may serve as a moderator of their confidence in their specialty, such that they may have lower SE. Perhaps understanding the degree to which a student's motivations to be a doctor are intrinsic could help explain SE variance. Although a direct link between high Outlook and high SE is not obvious, perhaps individuals who rated both highly share a common trait (e.g., neuroticism). For example, medical students who intend to specialize in neurosurgery may be very confident in their abilities, but may have negative views of the HCR and its future if they feel its focus is on primary care specialties (i.e., not neurosurgery). High self-efficacy could also be a result of students bolstering themselves against what they believe is a difficult medical career future. A common trend that will also be discussed later is that many medical students are committed to their overall medical career goals regardless of their HCR perceptions because of the already great personal investment of time and finances each has put into becoming a medical doctor. Such logic, referred to by some (e.g., Arkes and Hutzel, 2000) as the \"sunk cost fallacy,\" is a failure aversion strategy whereby individuals continue on a course of action despite evidence that it may not be the best course because they have passed \"the point of no return.\" 115 The significant negative association between Reaction and SE was predicted. Medical students who believed that the HCR would require a change in their career goals were less likely to feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals. Perhaps medical students who feel they must change their medical career goals (e.g., blocked goals) as a result of the HCR have lost some confidence that they can perform the tasks of their original goals within the changing health care landscape. Furthermore, such medical students may feel pressured to alter goals or change to a specialty for which they are less prepared, leading to lower efficacy. For example, a student who has been preparing to become a family doctor, but now predicts less autonomy as a family doctor after the HCR, may choose a subspecialty for which they were not academically prepared. There was no relationship between Uncertainty and SE, although a negative association was predicted. The lack of association between medical students' ratings of Uncertainty and SE ratings suggests that medical students who are experiencing non-activating uncertainty about the HCR are neither more nor less likely to feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals. In contrast to the association of Reaction with SE, medical students' SE was not associated with high ratings on Uncertainty items. Perhaps the non-activating characteristic of Uncertainty items is the key issue that distinguishes the differences in the associations of medical students' self-efficacy ratings with uncertainty ratings and reaction ratings. As previously discussed, Uncertainty and RA were not related. Perhaps, as with RA, Uncertainty may not affect more present-oriented variables. Although SE is future-oriented by definition, the SE scale used in the current study focuses more on proximal, rather than distal, future tasks and can thus may be affected similarly to present-oriented variables. Perhaps a better explanation for the lack of relationship between Uncertainty and SE reflects back on the non- activating nature of Uncertainty as compared to Reaction. If Uncertainty does not predict changes in behavior, it may also not predict changes in self-efficacy about that behavior. There was no relationship between Year and SE, although a positive relationship was hypothesized. The lack of association between medical students' Year and SE ratings suggests that medical students in different years of medical school are neither more nor less likely to feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals. The lack of association seems counterintuitive since one would think that more experience in medical school (i.e., mastery experience) would be associated with higher levels of SE. However, given the 116 substantial change in daily tasks from academic study and test-taking to application of knowledge in practice during Y3 and Y4 could make the aforementioned mastery experiences irrelevant to the new set of role tasks, thus decreasing self-efficacy within Y3 and Y4 and rendering no association, rather than the predicted positive association. In other words, the academic mastery experiences that should have led to higher SE through Y1 and Y2 for medical students may no longer apply with Y3 and Y4 students who are entering clerkships and clinical training. Although they are further in medical school and would normally be assumed to become more self-efficacious, the change in their roles may subdue their SE, such that the normal increase of SE with experience would not occur. Research Question 4 and Question 5 Research Question 4 is concerned with the variance explained in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment by SE and RA (two predictor model). Question 5 is concerned with the variance explained in Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment when all predictor variables are included in the model (six predictor model). The differences between the two and six predictor models will be discussed below. Variance Explained by RA and SE Degree Commitment variance in the two predictor model. In the two predictor model, the low magnitude of the variance explained in Degree Commitment by SE and RA was not significant. The aforementioned sunk cost trend may play a role in the severely left-skewed (high) ratings of Degree Commitment. The low variance explained by SE and RA is believed to be due to the invariance in Degree Commitment ratings. As well, perhaps with SE and RA being present-oriented or proximally future-oriented they do not affect long-term distal goals (e.g., Degree Commitment). It is important to determine what the nonsignificant magnitude of variance explained in Degree Commitment by SE and RA implies with regard to CLE theory and the hypothesized model. Because SE and RA are not variables included in CLE theory, little can be said to support or diminish CLE theory based on their use as predictors of commitment. However, it is clear that Degree Commitment, while informative for the current study, may not be appropriate as an outcome variable in future research, due to the finding that it is highly skewed and kurtotic. 117 Specialty Commitment variance in the two predictor model. In contrast to Degree Commitment, the modest magnitude of explained variance in Specialty Commitment was significant in the two predictor model. Medical students reported a moderately high amount of Specialty Commitment and varied more in their ratings of Specialty Commitment than they did on Degree Commitment. Thus, SE and RA predict variance in Specialty Commitment. Perhaps differences in specialties are related to students' SE and RA by the style of learning, the skills to be learned, and the types of students they attract. Degree Commitment variance in the six predictor model. With regard to the six predictor model, although the magnitude was low for the variance explained in Degree Commitment, it was significant. Again, due to the invariance of Degree Commitment ratings, the significance of the explained variance is noteworthy, suggesting that the variables in the model \"teased out\" the variance in Degree Commitment despite its extreme skewness. When Outlook, Reaction, Uncertainty, and Year were used in addition to SE and RA to predict Degree Commitment, the combined effects of all predictors may have explained a significant amount of variance that could not be achieved by one or two (e.g., SE and RA) variables alone. In contrast, it could be that as few as two of the added predictors in the six predictor model explained the variance in Degree Commitment to a significant extent. The theoretical belief about the high Degree Commitment rating is that students had invested such substantial amounts of money and time in becoming a medical student that few were willing to express less than absolute commitment. Admitting to oneself that he/she is not fully committed to a long-held lifelong goal could result in great cognitive disequilibrium, anxiety, and identity confusion for a medical student. Whereas there is evidence in the current data set (2012) that some medical students lament their decision to enter medical school (i.e., Reaction subscale) many other students may not be struggling with their commitment to medical school. To make such a long-term decision about a very difficult field of study and practice, it is likely that many medical students are, in fact, highly committed to their career choice of medicine regardless of external circumstances. A noteworthy consideration with respect to the possible investment-driven (i.e., sunk cost) high commitment level to the medical degree would be the potential for less- or un-invested individuals to be deterred from the field of medicine by their perceptions of the HCR. In other words, a Y3 or Y4 student, regardless of HCR perceptions, is unlikely to de-commit or lower 118 commitment to their medical career because of their large degree of investment in their goal of obtaining a medical degree. In contrast, a high school student or pre-med student with less investment in the field, but equivalent HCR perceptions may be more likely to choose a career with more perceived stability (i.e., less uncertainty). Furthermore, although an overall decrease in medical career pursuits is possible, it may be that the characteristics of future medical school applicants could be altered by the change in the field. For example, medical school applicants in the future could be increasingly characterized by such qualities as politically liberal, less interested in large salaries, more open to government regulation, more tolerant of ambiguity (i.e., higher TOA), more intrinsically motivated, and/or more interested in serving the underserved. Although the current sample of medical students already shows a large democratic party affiliation, the emphases of the HCR (e.g., primary care specialization) may attract even more individuals who are liberally-minded and/or share qualities (e.g., intrinsically motivated) that align individuals with the projected changes to the health care system under the HCR . Other possible explanatory variables for Degree Commitment may include degree of investment operationalized as time and money. For instance, a future study might ask students how many years they have invested toward becoming a medical doctor. Asking students to indicate their degree of student debt, while personal, could add explanatory value for Degree Commitment. If the sunk cost hypothesis postulated in the current study is valid, such variables might moderate the relationship of HCR variables and Degree Commitment. Specialty Commitment variance in the six-predictor model. There was a significant and substantially larger degree of explained variance in Specialty Commitment in the six predictor model. Although still a modest amount of variance in Specialty Commitment was explained, this is possibly the most remarkable finding of the study, as it indicates much more explained variance than was obtained for Specialty Commitment by RA and SE. Specifically, Outlook, Reaction, Year, RA, and SE contributed to explaining variance in Specialty Commitment, although Uncertainty did not contribute to the explained variance. As previously mentioned, medical students reported a moderately high amount of Specialty Commitment and varied more in their ratings than they did on their ratings of Degree Commitment. Although there is still over 70% of variance in Specialty Commitment that could be explained by factors not included in the model, this finding supports the usefulness of the 119 model to predict an important variable in the current health care system (i.e., specialty commitment). With the dearth of primary care physicians, it is important for medical educational personnel to be able to identify variables that will influence specialty choice in order to better guide students to specialty areas of grea test need (e.g., primary care). The current study's use of commitment was important to describe multiple, varying degrees of student investment in each specialty. However, the end goal of specialty choice research is to predict final specialty choices. Other possible explanatory variables for Specialty Commitment may include lifestyle needs (e.g., 9-5 schedule, family), personality (e.g., introversion/extroversion), clerkship (third- year clinical experience) influence, medical school mission, aptitude, student debt, and perceptions of specialties (i.e., expectations, difficulty, social praise, salary, repetition). In other words, differing specialties may allow more or less control over work hours (e.g., surgeons vs. internal medicine), may allow for more or less social interaction, may be (de)emphasized by clerkship faculty and/or medical schools overall, may require varying levels of skills in differing areas (e.g., steady hands for surgeons), and may be perceived as more or less difficult, prestigious, financially rewarding, and monotonous. While each specialty is attributed differing qualities that may or may not attract medical students, the differing personalities, needs, strengths, weakness, and perceptions of each medical student must meet the basic requirements (e.g., capability) of the specialty. Thus, medical students may attempt to match themselves to a specialty choice that is appropriate for them. At the same time, medical educators and federal representatives have reason to influence medical students' specialty choices to fit the medical needs of society. Parents and society may seek to influence the specialty choice as well. Therefore, within the complex system of needs, requirements, missions, and influences, a medical student may or may not be able to obtain their preferred specialty choice. The HCR framed as a CLE is a single, yet important variable of influence on specialty choice during the changing health care landscape. Role Ambiguity and Degree Commitment In the two predictor model, there was a significant negative relationship between RA and Degree Commitment. Medical students who felt uncertain about their daily roles and duties as a medical student were less likely to be highly committed to the medical degree. However, in the six predictor model, there was no relationship between RA and Degree Commitment. The change in the significance in the relationship of RA and Degree Commitment is most likely 120 attributable to the addition of the other predictor variables. After the addition of more variables to the model, the variance explained in Degree Commitment by RA was negligible (i.e., nonsignificant). The change in significance of the relationship of RA to Degree Commitment from the two predictor model to the six predictor model may be due to a spurious relationship between RA and Degree Commitment. In other words, due to a spurious relationship, the small model may have provided a false positive, such that a direct link was found between the two, when no such relationship truly exists. Role Ambiguity and Specialty Commitment There was a significant negative relationship between RA and Specialty Commitment in the two predictor model. Medical students who felt uncertain about their daily roles and duties as a medical student were less likely to be highly committed to their chosen medical specialty. More blatantly than with Degree Commitment, \"present-oriented\" uncertainty in the role of medical student and its responsibilities is related to medical students' lower commitment to or consideration of a change from the specialty to which they felt they would most likely choose. In the six predictor model, the negative relationship between RA and Specialty Commitment remained significant. The relationship continued to suggest that students who rated RA items higher were likely to rate Specialty Commitment lower. Again, medical students who felt uncertain about their daily roles and duties as a medical student were less likely to be highly committed to their chosen medical specialty. This finding might suggest that when a medical student is able to understand the expectations of his or her role as a medical student, he or she is more likely to commit to a specialty and to commit to a greater degree. Perhaps RA inhibits commitment to a specialty such that a medical student is not able to focus on which specialty to commit to if they are not sure what is expected of them on a daily basis. Self-efficacy and Degree Commitment In the two predictor model, there was no relationship between SE and Degree Commitment. The lack of association between medical students' ratings of SE and Degree Commitment ratings suggests that medical students who feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals are neither more nor less likely to be committed to the medical degree. The lack of association between the two is presumed to be due to the lack of variance in Degree Commitment (left-skewed). It seems intuitive that medical students with high 121 Degree Commitment would also be likely to report high Self-efficacy, although no significant relationship is likely to result when Degree Commitment is consistently highly rated. In contrast, SE may simply not be a meaningful predictor of Degree Commitment. There was again no relationship between SE and Degree Commitment in the six predictor model. As before, the lack of association between medical students' ratings of SE and Degree Commitment ratings suggests that medical students who feel confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals are neither more nor less likely to be committed to the medical degree. Again, the lack of association between the two is presumed to be due to the lack of variance in Degree Commitment. Self- efficacy and Specialty Commitment In contrast to the relationship of SE with Degree Commitment, there was a significant positive relationship between SE and Specialty Commitment in the two predictor model. Medical students who felt confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals were more likely to be highly committed to their chosen medical specialty. A medical student who finds a medical specialty for which they are well-suited is likely to endorse greater degrees of commitment to this specialty. Again, in the six predictor model, there was a significant positive relationship between SE and Specialty Commitment. The relationship of medical students' SE and Specialty Commitment suggests that students who rated SE items higher were likely to also rate Specialty Commitment higher. As before, medical students who felt confident in performing specific tasks to reach their medical career goals were more likely to be highly committed to their chosen medical specialty. Thus, a medical student who finds a medical specialty for which they believe they are well-suited (i.e., self-efficacious) is likely to have greater commitment to the specialty. Outlook and Commitment There was no relationship between Outlook and Degree Commitment. The lack of association between medical students' ratings of Outlook and Degree Commitment suggests that medical students who had a negative perception of the HCR and its future are neither more nor less likely to be committed to the medical degree. The lack of association between the two is presumed to be due to the lack of variance in Degree Commitment (left-skewed). Positivity or negativity (i.e., Outlook) about the HCR does not predict change in medical students' Degree 122 Commitment ratings. This is possibly due to the non-activating nature of Outlook, as with Uncertainty. The significant positive relationship between Outlook and Specialty Commitment was not predicted, although the variables were hypothesized to be associated. Medical students who had a negative perception of the HCR and its future were more likely to be highly committed to their chosen medical specialty. Although surprising to the researcher, some explanations for the relationship in the unexpected direction are offered. It could be that those who rate highly on Outlook and those who rate highly on Specialty Commitment share a common trait (e.g., personality, reason for practicing medicine, perception of a \"calling\" to the specialty; Goodin et al., 2013) that has not been included in the model. A second explanation of the finding is that medical students who have a negative perception of the HCR and its future may be \"holding fast\" to what they know. In the wake of uncertainty, perhaps they have committed even more strongly to their specialty choice and are less likely than before the HCR to consider alternative specialties. Reaction and Commitment The significant negative relationship between Reaction and Degree Commitment was predicted. Medical students who believed that the HCR would require a change in their career goals were less likely to be committed to the ultimate goal of obtaining the medical degree. The significant negative relationship supports the activating potential of Reaction in contrast to Outlook and Uncertainty. Medical students who feel the HCR presents a pressure or impetus to change career goals and priorities may be activated enough to rethink their commitment to their chosen profession. Similarly, the significant negative relationship between Reaction and Specialty Commitment was predicted. Medical students who believed that the HCR would require a change in their career goals were less likely to be committed to their chosen specialty. The significant negative relationship supports the activating potential of Reaction in contrast to Outlook and Uncertainty. The effects of environmental uncertainty cited by Locke and Latham (1990) as a deterrent to goal commitment may be best represented by the Reaction items of the HCRTS. Degree Commitment, in comparison with Specialty Commitment, was presumed to be less affected by the activating potential identified by Reaction items because medical students 123 should be able to more easily alter specialty changes and commitments. There is less investment of time and, especially, money in a medical student's specialty commitment. Therefore, modification of the specialty choice goal in reaction to the HCR would result in a smaller cost. For example, a student who was committed to a primary care specialty, if high in Reaction to the HCR, may choose to simply subspecialize in a primary care field. Such a change to a subspecialty may make a large difference in the degree to which the doctor will be regulated by the government during the HCR and would provide a significant increase in predicted income. After the AAMC (2006) call for medical schools to produce more primary care physicians, many more students have entered primary care. Yet, many who are now meeting the criteria for primary care are subspecializing and, thus, may not truly be meeting the supply need that the AAMC was targeting (AAMC, 2011c). In contrast to the presumed differences between Reaction and the two types of commitment, findings of the current study indicated that Degree Commitment and Specialty Commitment were similarly predicted by Reaction. Thus, Reaction may be associated with lower degrees of commitment to a goal regardless of the ease of modifying that goal. Perhaps, Reaction measures the degree of blockage of goals as much as it is measuring plans to modify goals, both of which would be indicated by lower commitment to those goals. Uncertainty and Commitment The significant positive relationship between Uncertainty and Degree Commitment was not predicted, although the two variables were hypothesized to be associated. Medical students who are experiencing non-activating uncertainty about the HCR and its future are more likely to be committed to the ultimate goal of obtaining the medical degree. It is noteworthy that the direction of the relationship between Uncertainty and Degree Commitment is positive. Rather than being activated to make medical career goal changes, medical students who rate Uncertainty items highly appear to take a \"stay the course\" attitude. In fact, commitment to the medical degree is significantly higher for those with perceptions of high uncertainty about the HCR and its future. Such ratings of higher Degree Commitment may indicate that a student is bolstering oneself in the face of uncertainty, in lieu of braving \"uncertain waters\" by rethinking their career plans. Such bolstering would conform to the assertions by Tubbs (1993) that primary goals are maintained by avoiding giving attention to other possible choices. Tubbs contended that the original choice would remain the default choice 124 unless evaluation of one's options determined a decrease in the value of the primary goal. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) reported the cost-benefit analysis that either supports goal commitment or a decrease in commitment. If the goal value decreased during cost-benefit analysis, motivation and commitment to the goal would also decrease. For these individuals, the investment of time and finances may be so great that subconscious doubts about their career choice may result in a posturing strategy that displays optimism, hope, and confidence in the HCR, thus suppressing possible fears. In terms of approach and avoidance, with regard to stressors or conflicts, Inglehart (1991) stated that we will do one or the other. Medical students often deal with uncertainty, but must have very clear plans to prepare for, be admitted to, and succeed in medical school. They must maintain control to the highest degree possible amidst all uncertainties. Perhaps medical students, well-versed in dealing with the unknown, are a population that tends to approach ambiguous situations (e.g., HCR) by remaining steadfast in their pursuits (i.e., retaining or increasing degree commitment) in order to maintain a sense of control and, ultimately, success where others might decrease or cease commitment. There was no relationship between Uncertainty and Specialty Commitment. The lack of association between medical students' ratings of Uncertainty and Specialty Commitment ratings suggests that medical students who are experiencing non-activating uncertainty about the HCR are neither more nor less likely to vary in their degree of commitment to their specialty choice. The lack of association between the two is presumed to be due to the non-activating nature of Uncertainty, despite the flexibility of Specialty Commitment. One might then wonder why Uncertainty would be positively related to Degree Commitment, but not relate to Specialty Commitment. A possible explanation is founded on the investment factor associated with Degree Commitment, but to a lesser degree with Specialty Commitment. Perhaps, when faced with perceived uncertainty, medical students commit further when the investment is already great. When the investment is not as pronounced as with Specialty Commitment, medical students faced with perceived Uncertainty may feel less need to bolster their position of commitment. They may still be open to changing specialties, or increasing or decreasing commitment to their chosen specialty, but will not do so from non-activating Uncertainty when the investment does not need to be emotionally guarded by higher levels o f commitment. 125 Year and Commitment There was no relationship between Year and Degree Commitment, although a positive relationship was predicted. The lack of association between medical students' Year and Degree Commitment ratings suggests that medical students in different years of medical school are neither more nor less likely to be committed to the medical degree. The lack of association between the two is presumed to be due to the lack of variance in Degree Commitment (left- skewed). An alternative explanation of the lack of association supported by the data is that medical students are highly committed to their medical degree in Y1 and remain highly committed through their fourth year, as evidenced by nonsignificant variation in means across years. The positive relationship between Year and Specialty Commitment was partially supported. The mean difference of Specialty Commitment ratings for Y2 students did not significantly differ from Y1. Y1 students had the lowest Specialty Commitment, while students in Years 3 and 4 differed significantly from Y1 students. There was a significantly higher level of agreement with Specialty Commitment statements for Y3 and Y4 students. Thus, based on their ratings of agreement on a 6 point Likert scale, Y3 students were more committed than Y1 students on average, likewise Y4 students were more committed than Y1 students on average. The Specialty Commitment ratings of Y4 students were the highest of all four years as expected by their need to determine their specific field of practice (e.g., neurosurgery). It may be that beginning medical students have interests in various specialties, but are uncommitted to any unique specialty. The greater commitment in Years 3 and 4 is explained by Earley (1985; 1986), who found that knowledge and information about how to reach a goal increased goal commitment. By Y3, students may have acquired sufficient information about their specialty choices. With plenty of time to make a specialty choice, Y1 and 2 students may remain low in Specialty Commitment in order to evaluate all of their options in light of information they are gathering. Discussion of Additional Findings The majority of students (80.6%) chose to share their sociopolitical views. Findings regarding medical students' sociopolitical views provide contextual understanding to the primary questions and hypotheses of the study. Most students aligned with Democratic (40.5%) or 126 Republican Party (20.5%), had voted for Obama or McCain in 2008, and had voted for Obama or Romney in 2012. Medical students' responses regarding the influence of the HCR on their voting behavior, their degree of attention paid to the HCR, and their comfort level with the HCR varied by candidate as shown in Table 8. The HCR was somewhat important for both Obama and McCain supporters in the 2008 presidential election, but higher for almost all voters, especially among Johnson and Stein supporters in the 2012 presidential election, suggesting that the HCR was an important, influential issue for medical students. It is unknown to what degree the increase in the influence of the HCR on voting between 2008 and 2012 may be due to a recency effect. Those who voted for Romney in 2012 reported the greatest degree of the HCR's influence on their voting choice and the least comfort with the HCR, while Obama supporters showed the highest comfort levels with the HCR. Supporters of different candidates varied little with regard to the amount of attention paid to the HCR in 2012, with all participants reporting a great amount of attention. The differences among types of voters in the medical student sample emphasizes the importance of the HCR to medical students lives, confirming that they are paying attention to the HCR and that they are responding to the HCR in their voting choices based on comfort levels. Those less comfortable with the HCR tended to vote for Romney, an opponent of the HCR in its current form, while those reporting higher degrees of comfort with the HCR tended to vote for Obama, the person most closely identified with HCR in its current form as \"ObamaCare.\" A critical question of the current study, evaluated throughout the findings of the study, has been the degree to which medical students are experiencing the HCR as a CLE. The substantial influence of the HCR on their voting choice supports the conceptualization of the HCR as a CLE. Discussion of Theoretical Evaluation Overall, the theoretical frameworks employed in the study were useful in understanding how medical student perceptions of the HCR as a CLE may influence their medical career choices (e.g., Specialty Commitment). Goal theory was successfully used to operationalize choice of specialty, specifically, as a commitment variable. The aforementioned Critical Life Event theory (Inglehart, 1991) was used as a theoretical framework to study medical students ' perceptions of the HCR as a potential CLE affecting their population. One primary question that the study sought to determine was the extent to which the HCR served as a CLE for medical 127 students. The influence of the HCR on voting choice was just one indicator that the HCR was a CLE for medical students. With regard to Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) model of stress appraisal, individuals who are pessimistic, specifically, may be experiencing the HCR as stress because it conflicts with their personal expectations, sociopolitical or religious values, and the general beliefs about aspects of living (e.g., [in]stability of the health care system). For others, high levels of optimism or pessimism indicated disturbance resulting from the HCR. High levels of uncertainty about the future of the HCR were a small, but valid indication that the HCR is requiring cognitive energies about perceived future uncertainty that would be unnecessary without change to the system. In other words, with regard to the CLE Theory, feeling HCR-specific uncertainty supports the HCR as a CLE for some medical students. Finally, the most obvious form of disturbance resulting from the HCR was found when medical students agreed with statements of upset, disruption, and need for modification of goal structures in reaction to the HCR. When medical students indicated that their plans were upset and/or they were going to change their specialty in reaction to the HCR, it was an overt display of reactance. Hence, they might dispel cognitive disequilibrium resulting from the HCR, stemming from conflict with their expectations and beliefs (optimism / pessimism), which may have resulted in feelings of uncertainty. With the current dearth of theoretical knowledge regarding what constitutes a threshold for a CLE, the research er perceives the less conservative criteria used in the current study as appropriate. According to Inglehart (1991), any degree of cognitive disequilibrium is evidence of a CLE (i.e., scores other than 3 for Outlook and scores other than 1 for Reaction and Uncertainty). However, in order to avoid the confound of natural cognitive disequilibrium found in everyday life and better understand the effects CLE disturbance, the criteria were set to emphasize medical students with a moderate to high level of disturbance. Based on the theoretical criteria set forth in the theoretical evaluation in Results, about one in four medical students perceive the HCR as a CLE on all three subscales, while over nine out of ten perceive the HCR as a CLE on at least one subscale. Approximately seven out of ten reported Outlook disturbance, one in five reported Reaction disturbance, and three in four reported Uncertainty disturbance. Thus, for the purposes of the current study and future studies, the influence of the HCR on medical students' lives is worthy of attention and further study. 128 In the process of gaining insight into the dynamics of CLE Theory and concepts, a new model may be appropriate to explore based on the information learned about the HCRTS subscales in the current study. It may be that Outlook predicts Uncertainty directly while also predicting Reaction directly and indirectly (by way of Uncertainty). Such a model would position Uncertainty and Reaction as outcome variables, but could be expanded to a larger model wherein Uncertainty and Reaction served as mediators or moderators of Outlook's relationship with more distal outcome variables such as RA, SE, or Specialty Commitment. In summation, the HCR is an important issue for medical students. It can affect their quality of life and work as well as academic success on a daily basis (e.g., SE) and may influence long-term career decisions, such as choosing a specialty. It should be emphasized that specialty choice is among the most important decisions a medical student will make, determining their lif e course trajectory. Specialty choice by medical students also has vital importance to the success of the HCR and the changing healthcare landscape. The degree to which medical students' HCR perceptions influence climactic career choices that are necessary to provide sufficient amounts of physicians with necessary skills warrants attention and future inquiry and discussion. Limitations and Implications of the Study The study sought to understand the medical students' perceptions of the HCR as a possible CLE in their life course and the impact of said perceptions on commitment to their medical career goals. A secondary objective of the study was to understand how medical students' perceptions of the HCR were related to Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy, and how RA and SE added understanding of medical career goals. There were several limitations, which could potentially impact the internal and external validity of the study, such as limitations in sampling, measurement, and data analyses. Limitations and Implications in Sampling The use of a convenience sample in the study may pose a threat to internal and external validity. All medical students attending allopathic medical schools in the United States were potential subjects, although only a limited number of schools and their students agreed to participate. Future research might be more inclusive of medical students in United States medical schools outside the continental 48 states (e.g., Puerto Rico) as well as other types of health 129 professionals in training or practice (e.g., doctors of osteopathy, nurses, physician's assistants, physical therapists, etc...). The HCRTS may be modified in many ways to measure non-medical student populations (e.g., general population). Although many geographical regions were represented in the study, there was an overrepresentation of the Midwest and underrepresentation of the Western states. The lack of representation from all continental states and all allopathic medical schools therein poses a threat to the study's external validity and limits the generalizability of the study to the United States medical student population. The underrepresentation of schools from all geographic regions is presumed to have been a factor limiting the demographic representativeness of the sample. Furthermore, the self-selection of schools that chose to allow their students to participate in the study may present bias in those who completed the survey. In other words, schools that place greater emphasis on the health care reform may have been more likely to participate, thus causing the sample to represent students that are more aware and /or interested in the health care reform. While some schools may have participated for the purposes of promoting medical education research, others may have had more agenda-oriented reasons (e.g., anti-HCR). One school, in particular, had many students who wrote to the researcher regarding what they felt was a biased instrument of their HCR perceptions, while the majority of other student feedback from other schools emphasized their interest in the study and its impact, without perceptions of the bias in the HCRTS. Such differences in feedback may be accounted for by the political environment of the study's medical students. Such differences could be analyzed in future grouping analyses based on political alignment. Another limitation is the demographics of the sample. Caucasians were slightly overrepresented in the sample, while all other ethnicities were underrepresented. The overrepresentation of Caucasian medical students is presumed to be related to the self-selection of medical schools in the Midwest. However, overall, the demographic representation of the sample w as not too dissimilar to the national population of medical students. The slight overrepresentation of Caucasians in the study is a limitation that influences population validity. Such threats to external reliability should be noted in interpretation of the results of the present study. Although several strategies were implemented to obtain participation from every allopathic medical student in the nation, future research sample representativeness may be 130 facilitated by increased rewards for participation and improved political connections to key medical school personnel (i.e., decision-makers). Limitations and Implications in the Measures Creating an original instrument presents limitations such as internal validity. The current survey included HCRTS modifications (i.e., additional items) to balance the number of items measuring each subscale in the 4-factor model supported by Goodin (2010). The intent of the HCRTS was to identify and measure medical students' perceptions of the HCR. The items were formulated from CLE theory (Inglehart, 1991) using content about the HCR obtained from the PPACA itself and interviews with medical students and doctors regarding their medical career goals. Thus, content and face validity were supported by multiple sources prior to the original survey dissemination (Goodin, 2010) and prior to its second dissemination in the current study. It is unclear to what extent the addition and modification of items on the HCRTS in the current study influenced a 3-factor model in the current data set. Although the change in factor structure is presumed to be related to the larger, more representative current sample, the validity of the HCRTS would benefit from further support in future studies. The factor structure reported by the HCRTS measurement model in the current study supported the CLE theory, but placed emphasis (e.g., more items resulting from EFA) on \"outlook\" (i.e., positivity/negativity) toward the event to a much greater extent than did Inglehart, the primary theorist associated with CLE theory. Despite the large number of items representing the Outlook factor, the Reaction subscale played a greater role in medical students' commitment to their specialties. Whereas Inglehart (1991) differentiated types of \"reactance,\" so did the 3- factor structure of the HCRTS. The differentiation of Reaction items from Uncertainty items, specifically, identified a difference in the degree to which medical students were activated by the uncertainty. Activation was operationalized in the items as the perception of the need to make a change in the medical career goals. Some items (i.e., Reaction items) emphasized a \"plan\" to change, specifically. Although the Outlook and Uncertainty subscales represented constructs described by Inglehart regarding cognitions about a CLE, the Reaction subscale operationalized behavioral techniques mentioned by Inglehart to manage the cognitive disequilibrium that arises from a CLE. Furthermore, the factor structure supported by the measurement model of the HCRTS differentiated cognitions of uncertainty that are activating from those that are simply evidence of 131 disturbance (e.g., excitement/upset). Greater emphasis on an individual's outlook toward a CLE and distinctions between cognitions of uncertainty (activating or non-activating) may improve the theoretical soundness of CLE theory and its application in future research. Whereas cognitive disequilibrium may be evidence that a CLE has occurred (i.e., Outlook or Uncertainty), behavioral responses to the CLE (i.e., Reaction) appear to be the most crucial predictor of outcomes (i.e., specialty commitment). This is not surprising given that a change in an outcome requires a change (or plan to change) in behavior. Thus, the plan for change represented by Reaction items was predictive of variation in SE, RA, and Specialty Commitment. Some unexpected circumstances occurred with the administration of the survey. Although very few technical difficulties were noted, the logistics of disseminating the survey led to complications in having all medical students take the survey at the same time. This issue may have limited the validity of the results by calling into question how events (i.e., the Presidential Election of 2012) may have impacted responses differently for those who took it before the election was finalized as opposed to afterward. Future research would benefit greatly by a more controlled dissemination of the survey, limiting time- and event-oriented confounds to the results. Some school-specific issues may have played a role in limiting validity as well. Some medical schools had unique differences with respect to their participation, such as limiting the number of times that students could be reminded of the survey opportunity, disallowing their students from being rewarded for participation (i.e., raffle), or requiring minor addendums (e.g., their own informed consent) to the survey at their school. It is noteworthy that the repeated reminders were shown to greatly improve response rate, while the single school that disallowed the participation reward did not differ substantially from other schools with regard to response rate. Future studies would benefit from repetition of the strategic formula used to promote participation, although improved communication with medical school administrators may further improve response rates. Although survey dissemination for all students at all participating schools was not too dissimilar, it is important to note the potential unknown threats to validity that may have resulted from the unique characteristics of each school. Medical students' perceptions (e.g., political attitude) are likely to vary across regions of the country, for instance. Barring the implicit \"human factor\" that limits the ability to control aforementioned dissemination timing issues and 132 unique school needs, the opportunity to limit such potential confounds in future studies would improve the validity of the results. For example, the AAMC, due to their affiliation with medical schools, is able to distribute its Matriculation Survey Questionnaire and Graduate Questionnaires to all U.S. allopathic medical students systematically without accommodation of individual school needs. Furthermore, the sociopolitical and demographic characteristics of each student and thei r respective schools could only be understood to a minimal extent. Certain regions of the U.S. represent differences in sociopolitical climate and demographic composition. Apart from improving upon the representativeness of the sample, future research and analyses could benefit from directing a focus to the characteristic grouping differences that may have impacted results differentially among schools. Yet another multi-sample study that could provide understanding about medical students would compare medical students by year samples (i.e., Sample 1 are Y1 students only, Sample 2 are Y2 students, etc.) and determine, for example, to what extent the factor structure of the HCRTS was consistent across groups. With regard to establishing reliability, the internal consistency of all instruments in the study w as assessed. Although all instruments showed acceptable inter-item consistency, exploratory factor analyses of the GSE (Jerusalem & Schwarzer, 1981) call ed into question the unidimensional nature of the instrument. Bandura's (1977a) Social Cognitive Theory did not purport a multidimensional structure to the concept of self-efficacy. However, due to the extensive, worldwide testing and support of the GSE's reliability and validity, it may be that the questionable unidimensionality of the instrument may be sample specific. Future studies of medical students that measure self-efficacy may benefit from the use of an alternate measure of SE. Four items were removed from the HCRTS due to insufficient primary loadings or problematic crossloadings, although no items were removed for model fit. The parsimony of the model showed evidence of convergent and discriminant validity, with minimal detriment to content validity. The instrument retains an imbalance in the items that represent each of its 3 subscales, with great emphasis on the Outlook (26 items) subscale, and possible underrepresentation of the Reaction (6 items) and Uncertainty (9 items) subscales. The instrument may benefit from the addition of items that improve the measurement of the latter two subscales in future studies. The current level of support for the external validity of the instrument 133 suggests the opportunity for the aforementioned use as a measure of other types of health professionals in training or practice (e.g., doctors of osteopathy, nurses, physician's assistants, physical therapists, etc.), as well as non-medical student populations (e.g., general population). Through modification and application to various populations, the measure may be used, perhaps, to evaluate a greater variety of HCR perceptions in other environments and characteristically different populations. Determining the degree to which the perceptions of the HCR impact political decision-making may be yet another use of the measure. Finally, all instruments included on the survey were limited in the number of items included in order to keep the overall survey at a manageable size so as to not overwhelm participants, decrease response rate, or result in order effects such as fatigue and attrition. The RA and Commitment instruments were shortened for the survey administration by using only the items with the highest loadings. However, future research results may benefit from use of the full instruments. The Commitment measure, specifically, did not differentiate commitment among medical students to the medical degree. Whereas this invariance of response and large skewness is likely more of a result of students' high degree of commitment to their degree, perhaps other questions could more effectively differentiate students who felt hesitant about their career choice. The commitment items may benefit from having their intent hidden, such that responses are less likely to result from presentation bias. For example, the HWK instrument has strong face validity. However, in order to decrease presentation bias, one might use items about commitment that would indicate degree of commitment by way of asking, for instance, to what degree a student might consider another course of action (reverse-scored). The study is limited in that the HCRTS is a new instrument that deserves more testing before widespread use. However, the study did establish an acceptable level of psychometric soundness of the instruments. Apart from the HCRTS, only measures with empirically-tested reliability and validity were used. Furthermore, their internal reliability was further supported by moderate to high Cronbach's alphas. The HCRTS was tested for internal reliability in the same manner, only after testing the fit of the factor structure using cross-validation. All reviewers and interviewees reported that the instrument had both face validity and construct validity. Additionally, by situating all of the HCRTS items within a medical context, the researcher was able to establish content validity. Reviewers and participants supported the content validity of the items through their feedback. One medical student who reviewed the HCRTS reported during an 134 interview, \" The survey asked a lot of valid questions. For medical students...I think a lot of medical students will be affected.\" A final noteworthy limitation is that the number of relevant variables included in the model were not sufficient, explaining only a small amount of variance in SE, RA, and commitment. Future studies will benefit from adding or replacing variables in the model that were not the focus of the present study. Examples of factors that may provide explanatory value for SE include evaluation of mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, social support and encouragement, and current level of success in medical school. For RA, examples of factors that may provide explanatory value include participation, social support, and role overload. Examples of factors that may provide explanatory value regarding medical career goal commitment in future studies include personality traits, mental health status, academic abilities, self- determination, financial status, and expectations regarding medical school. The results of the study, however, are sufficient to have implications for the field of medical education. Many medical students appear to experience the HCR as a CLE. The HCR does seem to be affecting their daily role ambiguity and self-efficacy as well as their commitment to long-term goals (i.e., obtaining the M.D., choosing a specialty). Professionals in medical education may benefit by noting the influences of the HCR on many medical students daily lives and long-term decision-making. Medical education professionals may find it beneficial to promote greater knowledge and understanding of the HCR in order to improve the daily mental health and success of medical students as well as to appropriately predict and fulfill the supply and demand needs of the health care system that have been emphasized by the AAM C (2007). Conclusion The Affordable Care Act and the ongoing health care reform have become a prominent issue in the U.S. political and social landscape. The health care system is changing, although no one knows to what extent health care professionals' roles may change. Goal theory and Critical Life Event theory suggest that perceptions of change may result in modification of goals. The primary purpose of the study was to understand medical students' perceptions of the health care reform as a possible critical life event in their life course and the impact of said perceptions on commitment to their medical career goals. Secondly, this study examined how 135 medical students' perceptions of the reform were related to Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy, and how Role Ambiguity and Self-efficacy added understanding of variations in commitment to medical career goals. Given the importance of effectively meeting the demands of the changing health care landscape, the data analyses from the current study showed that medical students ' perceptions of the health care did predict specialty choice commitment levels of future doctors. Students' commitment levels to the medical degree depend, in part, on their feelings of uncertainty about the health care reform and re-evaluation of their career goals in response to the reform. The findings of the study suggest that students' commitment levels to a specialty can be predicted by five influences on medical students: (1) Outlook, or feeling positively or negativel y about the health care reform; (2) Reaction, or re-evaluation of their career goals in response to the reform; (3) Uncertainty, or uncertainty in their daily duties as a medical student; (4) Self- efficacy, or confidence that they can still succeed in the proximal goals that will get them to their intended specialty and the medical degree; and (5) Year, or their year in medical school. Although the public view of the health care reform is important, medical students' perceptions of the health care reform not only predict what type of doctor they will become (i.e., specialty choice), but must also be indicative of the quality of care that the reform will bring to the health care system. The current study provided evidence that medical students are making career decisions based on their thoughts and feelings about the health reform. Medical education must take note of the health reform's impact, not to impede the reform, but, rather, to be able to understand and advise medical students within the changing health care landscape. 136 APPENDIX A FSU IRB HUMAN SUBJECTS COMMITTEE PROPOSA L The Florida State University Office of the Vice President For Research Human Subjects Committee Tallahassee, Florida 32306-2742 (850) 644-8673 \u00b7 FAX (850) 644-4392 APPROVAL MEMORANDUM (for change in research protocol) Date: 6/19/2012 To: Joel Goodin Address: Dept.: EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AND LEARNING SYSTEMS From: Thomas L.
