These problems usually come in a mixture of many of these symptoms, and many I did not mention. There is a reason for that. I find those reasons through Bloodwork and with Chinese Medicine Diagnostic modalities, and I am willing to work with individuals who are ready to take the necessary steps to restore themselves back to full health. I focus on treating the source of illness with the most modern and comprehensive healing modalities possible. Chinese Medicine and Functional Medicine work in conjunction with each other to find the source of illness. There is no secret that the body will not reveal. I specialize in finding those reasons, and resolving them. For many people it may seem that living with chronic pain, or chronic illness is a normal thing. I have seen this my entire life watching my family members suffer from Diabetes, Thyroid Disorders, Cancer, and Parkinson's Disease. I chose to break myself free of that being my future, and you can too. There is another way. I invite you to step into this life.
