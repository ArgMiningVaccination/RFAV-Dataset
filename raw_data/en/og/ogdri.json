Vermont Child Vaccine Program (VCVP) The Vermont Child Vaccine Program (VCVP) covers those eligible for the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, as well as the privately insured population under age 19 that covers all CDC-recommended vaccines. VFC- Congress created the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program in 1993. The goal of the VFC Program is to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases by removing or reducing cost barriers. The VFC program is funded by federal entitlement money guaranteed to each state to buy vaccine for children who are: - Medicaid eligible - uninsured - underinsured (defined in this case as a health insurance policy that doesn't cover vaccination services) - American Indian/Alaska Native. Vermont Adult Vaccine Program (VAVP) In 2007, the Vermont Department of Health initiated a program to provide adult (ages 19-64) vaccines at no cost to provider practices. This program, known as the Vermont Adult Vaccine Program (VAVP) is modeled after the VCVP program. All primary care and OB/GYN providers may enroll. "}
