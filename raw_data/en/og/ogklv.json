The herb was naturalized in the eastern part of the United States, where it today primarily grows wildly. There are over 200 species in the Artemisia genus. Southernwood is closely related to Eur opean wormwood (absinthe.) Botanical Description: Artemisia can be differentiated from other closely related plants with gray -green leaves due to the distinct lemon smell emitted by their leaves when crushed. For the majority, the plants in the genu s have small, alternate leaves, with dioecious flowers. With age, these plants become progressively woodier.1 Southernwood is a small shrub that can reach five feet high on average, with a spread of 2 feet. Southernwood has small, yellow -white flowe rs which blo om in late summer; though, the s outhernwood located in northerner regions of the world rarely flower. The herb has a lemony/camphor like fragrance which turns distinctly lemony when cut. Its gray -green leaves are slightly hairy, though become less so as the season progresses.2 Etymology: \"Southernwood\" is the Old English name for \"woody plant that comes from the south.\" Its g enus derives from Artemis, the God dess of chastity . \"Abortanum \" comes from the G reek word \"abros\" meaning \"delicate .\" 3 Artemis is also known as Diana, the Mother of all Creatures and Goddess of the Herbalist, the Hunt and Wild things.4 Southernwood has many other names including: Appleringie, Boy's Love, European Sage, Garden Sagebrush, Lad's Love (because of its a ncient reputation as an aphrodisiac,)5 Lemon Plant, Lover's Plant, Maid's Ruin, Old Man or Old Man Wormwood (the herb's extra winter foliage makes the herb appear tattered, but protects the plant from harsh winds,)6 Our Lord's Wood and Southern Wormwood. Cultural Significance: There are many cultural myths surrounding this herb. For instance, an individual will \"see the beloved\" if the herb is used as a dream pillow, sachet or charm7. Also, in Europe in the 16th century, 1 Armitage, A.

Southernwood was also believed to stimulate a young man's passion. This belief is apparent in the English Herbalist Henry Lyte's 1578 recommenda tion that \"it be layde it provoketh the carnall copulation and resisteth all enchantments, which may let or hinder such business and the inticements to the same.\"8 People also believed the herb to stimulate the growth of men's beards; thus, men would rub an ointment made from the herb 's ashes on their faces religiously.10 Furthermore, women used the herb to keep awake during \"tedious\" sermons.11 The herb also had a significant, practical place in the medieval households. Maddens used the herb in large manors and palaces as \"strewing herbs. \" Strewing herbs were herbs placed around the house to mask the unpleasant scents that contaminated the air before personal hygiene, pluming and sanitation existed . 12 19th Century American Significance: Southernwood was first grown in upstate New Yor k in the late 1700's. In 1789, settlers established the first white settlement in Ithaca. The se gardens were very simple . The infiltration of Dutch immigrants to the area is evident in the change in the herb's bulb variety in the area by 1869. Southern wood was called the \"meeting plant\" in colonial New England for it was used as a Sunday posy (or bouquet.) 13 Uses: Medicinally , southernwood has for acne, scrofula stomachic and vermifuge.14&15 Traditionally , this herb was also used as an emmenagogue (an herb which entices menstrual bleeding,) stimu lant-tonic, diuretic, a worming agent (because of its close relation to wormwood) and a good wash for acne (when combi ned with 8 O'Connor 15. 9 Callery 69. 10 Duke, J.A.

Further, it has been used to fight against coughs, tumors and cancers Southernwood is n ot typically used as a culinary herb today; the herb h as a very bitter taste.21 The Italians used to use the herb in stuffing to flavor meat and in cakes.22 It has also been used as a flavoring of beer. Further, t he young shoots h ave previously been used to flavor puddings and pastries.23 Industrially, s outhernwood has several different uses. Its yellow flowers are used to dye wool yellow. It can be used as a bath aroma when added to a bath as an infusion, essential or bath oil . An infusion is very simple to make, one simply seeps the herb as you would with tea in boiling water; though, essential and bath oils require a much more complicated process.24 Southernwood is also a staple in herb wreaths, baskets and as foliage for fl ower arrangements. In contrast to lemon balm, southernwood's odor is offensive to bees and thus used as a bee deterrent. When dried, the herb's leaves act as a moth and insect repellant.25 A Swedish study validates this claim, finding that southernwood showed a relatively significant repelling effect on ticks of a certain stage.26 The repellant property of the herb is due to the fact that it's essential and volatile oils contain absinthol.27 One way to use the herb as a repellant is to make a sachet (a s mall, pulverized blend of herbs in a small bag.) Below are instructions to make a moth repellant sachet : The sachet calls for: Six ounces of dried s outhernwood \u00bd ounce of ground orris root (a species of iris) \u00bd ounce of a ground spice such as cloves , cinnamon or coriander 16 Rose, J.

To make the sachet : First, grind the s outhernwood until it resembles a powder. Then add in the spice and orris root. Store the combined mixture in a sealed container to ensure the flavors blend sufficiently and that any excess li quid is absorbed. Put the mixture into a sachet and the scent will ward off moths.28 Cultivation: Southernwood, a perennial herb that flowers in August, can propagate from root divisions or cuttings. It can re -grow yearly from the previous year's new wood. Ideal growing conditions for the herb include a Har diness zone of 3 or 4, a soil pH of 6.7, well -drained soil and full sun light.29 For best results, the herb should be planted four feet apart in the spring or fall. Southernwood needs to be pru ned back in the spring because if not done, the herb will appear very \"weedy\"30 by midsummer. A staple in an ornamental her b garden, one typically plants s outhernwood in the back of a border or as a hedge. This is done to emit the lovely odor of the herb when one brushes up against it. Or, the herb works as a great \"filler\" herb between seasonally blooming plants due to its silver/gray leaves.31 28 Reader's Digest Association 425. 29 Kowalchik 470. 30 Armitage 64. 31 Reader's Digest Association 400 - 401.
