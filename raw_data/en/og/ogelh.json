Design: Qualitative semi-structured interview studies Setting and Participants: Family carers of relatives residing in care homes in the UK and the Netherlands were interviewed remotely. Methods: Family carers were asked about their experiences of care home visits during the pandemic, and speci cally in the Netherlands after care homes had reopened. Transcripts were analyzed in each country separately in the native language using thematic analysis, before discussing ndings at multiple analysis meetings. Results: Across 125 interviews, we developed four themes: (1) different types of contact during lockdown; (2) deterioration of resident health and well-being; (3) emotional distress of both visitors and residents; and (4)compliance to guidelines and regulations. Visiting in both the UK and the Netherlands was bene cial, if possible in the UK, yet was characterized by alternative forms of face-to-face visits which was emotionally distressing for many family carers and residents. In the Netherlands, government guidance did enable early carehome visitation, while the UK was lacking any guidance leading to care homes implementing restrictions differently. Conclusions and Implications: Early and clear guidance, as well as communication, is required in future pandemics, and in this ongoing pandemic, to enable care home visits between residents and loved ones. It is important to take learnings from this global pandemic to reimagine long-term care, highlighting the value of socializing for care home residents. Key words: dementia, care homes, COVID-19 Introduction Since the global COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, care homes across the world have taken restrictive mea-sures to stem infection rates and safeguard theirvulnerable older adult residents. In the UK, therewas no government guidance on how care homes should operate and how they should enable family visitation, leading care homes individually to all close down to outside visiting from February 2020 onward.Throughout the pandemic and in between waves oneand two, care homes in the UK have made individualdecisions of how to ease and then tighten visiting rulesagain. In the UK, there was a substantial lag before effective and suf cient personal protective equipment (PPE) was available for staff, residents or visitors.

In the Netherlands, both during the rst and second wave, over 800 Dutch care homes had a COVID-19 outbreak (approx. 35%). Care home residents have been most affected byCOVID-19, with approximately 50% of allCOVID-19 deaths during the rst wave occurring within care homes, estimated at 7,400 COVID-19 deaths in care homes (29% of total deaths in care homes) (Inzitari et al.,2020 ). During the rst wave of COVID-19, restrictive measures in the Netherlandsincluded a total ban for visitors to care homes. Thistotal lockdown of care homes lasted 2 months, after which a national pilot was started to cautiously reopen care homes for visitors. In a selection ofhomes, one visitor per resident was allowed. Many care home residents are aged 65 +years and some live with dementia. Evidence is starting to emerge on how the pandemic and associated restric-tions are impacting on people living with dementiain general, focusing on those residing in the com-munity (Giebel et al. ,2021 ; Giebel et al. ,2021 ; Talbot and Briggs, 2021 ; Thyrian et al. ,2020 ). People with dementia are found to deteriorate fasterduring lockdowns and restrictions in their ownhome, being con ned to their place of residence and not receiving external face-to-face social sup- port. This is also impacting on the mental well-being of family carers, as carers have to take on additionalcaring duties (Hanna et al.,2021 ). Evidence on the impact of the pandemic on care home settings issparser however, with little evidence to date on how residents are faring during continued lockdowns of care homes and changing restrictions. Verbeek et al. (2020 ) was the rst study to report on compliance and experiences with allowing visi- tors back into nursing homes after a ban during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Thestudy showed that in general the experiences withreopening the nursing home for visitors was verypositive. Furthermore, even though there were national guidelines, there was diversity among nurs- ing homes with regard to the use of PPE, and thearrangements of the visits. Findings from this studywere mainly based on a questionnaire and interviewwith formal contact persons in different nursing homes. The authors of the study indicated that more research is needed into in-depth experiencesof family, residents, and staff in order to investigatethe impact of the visitor ban and the reopening ofnursing homes. A subsample of those nursing homes was monitored during reopening using a digitalquestionnaire, on-site observations and in-depthinterviews (Koopmans et appeared to be bene cial to the well-being of residents, healthcare professionals expressed con- cerns over increased risks of infection whileacknowledging the bene ts of reopening. This is supported by more research emerging on infectiontransmission of COVID-19 in care homes (Burton et al. ,2020 ; Stall et al. ,2020 ), as opposed to the experiences and psychological impacts of lack ofvisitations on family members and residents. How-ever, research across the globe indicates the ne balance that needs to be struck between managing infection risks and quality of life for residents (Aya- lon and Avidor, 2021 ; Sizoo et al.,2020 ;V a n et al., 2020 ). In particular, residents and carers appear to face high levels of emotional burden due to carehome closures to the outside world (Ayalon and Avidor, 2021 ;V a n et al.,2020 ), while a small Delphi panel made up of 21 USA and Canadian post-acuteand long-term care experts yielded ve recommen- dations for care home visiting during the pandemic,including stringent infection control measures, enabling visits, and limited physical contact between family members and residents (Bergman et al. , 2020 ). Thus, drawing together ndings from indi- vidual countries has highlighted to date the need forsafe visiting in care homes (Low et al.,2021 ). How- ever, there appears to be a lack of qualitative cross- country data comparing the experiences of differenttypes of care home visitation during the COVID-19pandemic so that comparisons between different countries is important to make the best use of ex- isting knowledge to further advance care for resi-dents during the pandemic and beyond. The aim of this international study was to explore the experiences of family members of care home residents regarding care home visiting during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare these betweenthe UK and the Netherlands. The Netherlandsappears to have been the rst country to have im- plemented consistent guidance for care home visi- tation during the pandemic and indeed has been the only country to mandate the reopening of carehomes to visitors (Low et al. ,2021 ). In contrast, there has been a lack of clear guidance on care home visitation in the UK. This provides an important perspective for exploring how care home visits wereundertaken in different countries and their potentialvariations and similarities in affecting family mem-bers of care home residents. Despite varied degrees of vaccine rollouts across the globe, COVID-19 is going to remain an environmental infection threatfor some time to come, particularly in the light ofcontinued new virus strains developing which may2C.

Methods Participants and recruitment Family carers aged 18 +years with a relative resid- ing in a UK or Dutch care home were eligible to takepart. In the UK, unpaid carers were recruited via third sector organizations, targeted emailing of care homes as part of the NIHR ENRICH network, a network of research-ready care homes, as well as via social media. At the point of data collection, there were different restrictions in place for each care home, while during November, care homes went into full lockdown. In the Netherlands, family carers who visited their family member at the beginning of the cautious reopening were informed about the study while they were receiving information onthe regulations and guidelines with regard to their visit (via phone, and again right before the time of the visit). Immediately after the visit, the family carers that were willing to participate, were asked to perform a short interview (after signing an informed consent). In addition, potential partici- pants were asked if they were willing to participate in a more in-depth phone interview 1 week after their rst visit. Ethical approval was obtained prior to study begin from the [BLINDED] ethical committee in the UK [Ref: 7626], and from the ethics committee of [BLINDED] (2020-6549) in the Netherlands. Data collection: Data and procedure O u rd a t ac o m p r i s eo ft h r e ep a r t s -in-depth inter- views from the UK were conducted between Octo- ber and November 2020. Short interviews and in-depth interviews from the Netherlands were both conducted during May 2020. The short interviews were conducted immediately after the rst visits since the lockdown. The in-depth inter- views were performed within 1 week following the rst visit. While studies in the UK and the Nether- lands were conducted separately, they focused on the same topics in both countries and were thus comparable. In the UK, topic guides for family carers and for care home staff were co-produced in a team of academics, clinicians, service providers, and unpaid carers of people living with dementia who haveexperience of care homes. Topic guides involved questions surrounding their experiences of visita- tion, how the pandemic has changed different aspects of seeing their relative with dementia in the care home, communication from the carehome, as well as safety procedures and how care provision has changed for care home staff compared to before the pandemic, and how they experience residents to experience these changes. Appendix 1 includes all topic guides. In the Netherlands, short interviews were aimed at capturing the experiences of the family carers during the lockdown and their rst visit to the nursing home after the lockdown. The focus was on the impact on their well-being, and the possibility to comply with all guidelines that were in place (e.g. 1.5 m distance during the visit, no touching, wearing a mask, etc.). The short interviews were held for 5 consecutive days. A group of researchers was present at a nursing home during the rst 2 to 3 weeks of the reopening. All nursing home residents were sched- uled to receive a visitor once during the rst week, where they had a visitor. Unpaid carers who were scheduled to visit the nursing home were informed about the presence of the research team and were asked to provide consent for having a short interview with one of the researchers after they visited their family member. In addition, in-depth interviews were scheduled with participants who already took part in the short interviews. Short interviews therefore provided the rst picture of the experiences, which was more extensively elaborated on in longer follow-up inter-views for some family carers, with both together providing a rich picture of the nuanced experiences of carers. Furthermore, in four other care homes, visitors were asked to participate in an interview by telephone which was to be held within a few days after the visit. During this in-depth interview, parti- cipants were asked about the process of planning their visit, the communication regarding the visita- tion, and again, compliance and impact on well- being were discussed.

In these response sheets, (short) summaries on the response of par- ticipants were given for each of the posed questions. Next, the data were analyzed thematically withinthe research team using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ). Open codes were given to sentences or paragraphs within the summaries, after which codes were grouped into overarching topics/themes. The codes and themes were dis- cussed repeatedly in order to reach consensus on the most relevant themes with regard to the research question.Care home visiting during the pandemic 3 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002799 Published online by Cambridge University PressPublic involvement Carers and people with dementia were involved in different aspects of this study in the UK. Threecurrent and former carers were involved in all ele- ments of this study, from conceptualization to con- duct, analysis and dissemination. Public advisers,who were reimbursed for their participation, helped develop the topic guides, ensuring that the questions asked captured the important points in the lives offamily members with relatives residing in care homes. There was no public involvement in the Netherlands research planning and delivery. Results Background characteristics A total of 125 family carers (99 Dutch; 26 UK) participated in the study. Of the 99 Dutch inter- views, 65 short interviews lasting between 5 and 15minutes and 34 in-depth phone interviews lasting between 30 and 40 minutes were conducted. Table 1 provides some background demographics of theinterviewed carers. In the UK, the majority of carers were female (69.2%) and adult children of the care home residents (61.5%). In the Dutch sample,demographics were gathered on the participants of the in-depth interviews (n =34). Half of the included carers were male and half were female. The majority(70%) of carers were the adult child of the resident. Qualitative ndings We developed four themes using thematic analysis: (1) different types of contact during lockdown; (2) deterioration of resident health and well-being; (3) emotional distress of both visitors and residents; and(4) compliance to guidelines and regulations. Quotes for each theme and subtheme are presented in Table 2. THEME 1: D IFFERENT TYPES OF CONTACTS DURING LOCKDOWN V ery limited face-to-face contact In the UK, many carers were not allowed face-to-face visits either since the pandemic started or at different time pointsof the pandemic. Some were allowed to have face-to- face visits in the garden, in customized pods or through windows, and a rare exception was for acarer to visit their relative in their room. Where visits were allowed, care homes had booking systems in place to manage the number of people in the homesat any time, as well as care home staff to facilitate visits with family members. Similarly, in the Nether- lands, relatives indicated that during the lockdownthey had no face-to-face contact with their relatives. However, the majority of respondents from both countries indicated that the nursing homesemployed creative solutions to stay in contact witheach other. Respondents talked about the possibility to have window visits, to talk over the phone on a regular base, sharing information via internet plat-forms, and to talk to their loved ones via videocalling. In the UK, some carers noted preferential visiting rights by some family members, while they them- selves were not allowed to go in or only rarely. This caused some frustration, as care homes also failed tocommunicate why certain residents were allowedmore visits than others. In the Netherlands, duringthe reopening of the nursing homes, each resident was allowed only one visitor. However, most re- spondents indicated that it was quite straightforwardto decide who this person would be (as most of thetime there is a \"rst responsible family carer \"). Remote vs. face-to-face visits Both remote and the new pandemic-created face-to-face visits seemed to be ofmuch less bene t to family members and residents as opposed to true face-to-face contacts experienced and enjoyed prior to the pandemic. In both coun- tries, respondents indicated that visits were morebenecial than remote engagement; however, these also had their downsides. Garden visits, for example, were weather-dependant, and if the weather was not suitable, window visits were conducted instead,where care homes enabled these. There was an issuefor some residents who were not living on the ground floor, being excluded from window visits and causing further distress to the new forms ofalternative visiting forms. Many carers shared howtheir relative with dementia was unable to under- stand socially distanced face-to-face visits or hear their relative from a distance, highlighting howalternative visiting options could not replace realface-to-face contacts. Where remote contact was enabled digitally, such as via skype, there was rarely any privacy, as carehome staff had to support the resident in using a phone or tablet, and often with limited understand- ing from the resident. Carers expressed concernsabout being unable to have a private conversationwith their relative. Pod visits similarly offered little privacy, highlighting overall how different types of COVID-19 visits have changed the dynamics, com-pared to visits in the resident 's room for example. Some carers noted that the types of visits that were allowed would not have been taken up by theresidents if it was pre-pandemic. For example, one UK carer explained that her husband would never have sat in the garden, so having a pandemic garden4C. Giebel et al. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002799 Published online by Cambridge University Pressvisits would be of no use and bene t. Equally, pod visits or window visits would never have been used pre-pandemic and outside of an infection-controlled environment. Missing the personal touch While carers bene ted to some extent from the socially distanced face-to-face visits, carers alsoexpressed their upset about needing to hold their relative 's hand to feel close to them. Missing the personal human touch between family members andresidents was also expressed as an issue where care home residents did not comprehend window visits and for example got agitated due to the inability tobe close to their family member. Although in the Netherlands everyone was happy to be able to visit again, due to the guidelines of keeping distance, notouching, and the wearing of face masks, a visit was sometimes experienced as disappointing, dif cult, or nervous. THEME 2: D ETERIORATION OF RESIDENT HEALTH AND WELL -BEING Noticing faster deterioration Carers in both countries noticed an increased deterioration in symptoms and the condition of their relatives with dementia duringthe pandemic and since lockdowns and other restrictions had commenced. This not only included the residents 'cognitive and physical symptoms, but also their well-being. Where some residents had been active before the pandemic, since then carers were complaining and concerned about the dete-riorations in mobility within often relatively short periods of time, both in the Netherlands and the UK.THEME 3: E MOTIONAL DISTRESS OF BOTH VISITORS AND RESIDENTS Concern over relative Many family members were concerned over their relative 's well-being and their relationship with them. The increased periods of being unable to visit their relative worried carers,especially where they received little communication from the care homes about their well-being. In effect, care home staff took on an unplanned newrole of family, caring for the residents at all times and not allowing their real family to enter the care homes. This was heightened by the fact that allUK residents and many Dutch residents were living with dementia, and thus more likely to forget their own family members by being unable to see them ona regular basis. W orry about transmitting virus Visiting their relative posed mixed feelings to visitors. Many enjoyed visiting their relative but many were also scared ofthe risks posed by reopening care homes. Reopening care homes could result in increased risks of virus transmission, without suf cient testing and other restrictions in place, which left some carers accept- ing that care homes should stay closed in the UK. Others however, in the UK, were frustrated with thelack of visiting and were desperate for care homes to open their doors again to properly connect and communicate with their relative again. Emotional response from visitors and residents/intensity of emotions Visitors indicated that it was good to see each other after a long time. However, Dutch andUK experiences seemed to differ slightly in terms of emotional impact on both carers and residents. In the Netherlands, most residents were happy andTable 1.

THEME 1: Different types of contacts during lockdown Very limited face-to-face contact \"We have no communication with them whatsoever in terms of the changes. They might in the summer when they decided garden visits could happenthat was just by chance and one of them you know the activitiescoordinator telling me there 's been no official written information or anything about any anything. \"UK ID21, female carer \"They have purchased a phone for my mother, however she does not understand how it works. Therefore, I now call to the ward every day, andthe staff then makes sure I can video-chat with her. So now me and mybrothers call her every day. \"Dutch ID0512E3, daughter of resident \"I didn 't get told she 'd had a fall; my brother rang me which is what I didn 't want. So after it I did say to the home I need to be contacted I have askedyou erm they did apologise for that erm but I went in the other week andthey 've changed her GP and she said you got the letter and I said no I didn 't get a letter. \"UK ID10, Female carer, Daughter Remote vs. face-to-face visits \"They made like French doors out to the outside where there had been a window and they built a room with a glass partition with a door in it acrossthe middle of the room and most importantly it had a very goodmicrophone and speaker system in it like a conference phone and I visitedmum in there once but and sadly for me and for mum it didn 't work. Because she couldn 't, she was obviously failing as well she didn 't realise I was on the other side of the glass, I think she sort of looked at she couldonly see the glass but she couldn 't appreciate that I was on the other side. \" UK ID12, male carer, son \"I did a window visit once, however my mother responded poorly to that, as it was a scary situation for her, as we could not touch each other forinstance. \"Dutch ID0511J3, daughter of resident \"I have to talk to her in the presence of the carer which I don 't mind particularly but obviously it 's not private or personal and it 's dependent on what sort on what sort of mood she 's in whether she 's talking to you know my dad and my grandmother and everybody or whether she 's asleep. But err recently she 's been, if I get the same carer she really really relates to one carer so I 've arranged that I only Skype now when she 's working and then it works quite well. I mean we sing songs together and I can show her round my house and go into the garden and things. \"UK ID20, family carer \"We do video calls but it isn 't the same he doesn 't quite understand well he doesn 't understand full stop what 's happening. I suppose in some ways it might be a good thing to have dementia because you cannot figure outwhat 's going on in the world. \"UK ID01, female carer \"They ' re still saying well you can do garden visits and [person] had said well who 's going to want to sit in the garden in October anyway. [Person with dementia] if he were able to say anything even in his normal stay at homehe wouldn 't have gone and sat in the garden in this weather. \"UK ID02, Female carer, Spouse Missing the personal touch \"It's absolutely urgent that essential carers get into homes but it need to be managed and it can be managed. I want to, I offered months ago to have atest to have regular tests to wear the aprons and the gloves but sanitize myhands, wear a visor not a mask and hold [relative 's] hand because if I don 't hold his hand then I might as well not be there. \"UK ID02, female carer, spouse ''Normally I always hug and kiss her when I visit, and that 's very different now. I would have preferred to be able to visit in her own apartment, andto be able to actually hug her, however that 's not possible at the moment. '' Dutch ID NCVC03, son of resident6 C. Giebel et al. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002799 Published online by Cambridge University Presscomfortable during visits, whereas a few were sleepy/ absent or confused. Face-to-face contact had added value, but relatives also mentioned that visits were different and less enjoyable than before due to thelack of physical contact and not being allowed to walk outside. Some residents got agitated not under- standing why they could not touch their relative orwhy they were behind a window or screen. These negative experiences were re flected in many UK carers, with residents being agitated for a lack ofunderstanding the physical distance and screens between them and their loved ones, leading to emotional upset in many carers.THEME 4: C OMPLIANCE TO GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS Respecting the importance of guidelines In the Nether- lands, all respondents indicated to understand the importance to adhere to all the guidelines. The initial response of most participants was that it was easy to adhere to the guidelines. Similarly,UK carers expressed it was important to adhere to the guidelines. However, where the resident was in the end of life stages, carers were allowed to holdtheir relative 's hand with restrictions eased sur- rounding physical distancing.Table 2.

THEME 2: Deterioration of resident health and well-being Noticing faster deterioration \"I visited my father and I noticed a strong deterioration compared to 8 weeks ago. My father was just lying in bed the whole time, he was notreally present anymore, and very hard to talk to, to get in contact with.This was a strong contrast with 8 weeks ago, then he was much moreactive, and easy to connect with. Also, I noticed he had very skinny armsand legs, and I heard that he fell out of bed a lot. \"Dutch ID0513H3, son of resident THEME 3: Emotional distress of both visitors and residentsConcern over relative \"It's quite upsetting knowing the way that it 's like he 's got a new family and because he lives with them all the time he can forget me obviously. \"UK ID01, female carer Worry about transmitting virus \"If I have any queries it 's with how government have handled the whole thing really and I think I do think, well I utterly understand that they can 't let visitors in because you know danger of death, I completely understandthat, at the same time I do think we 're being held hostage because they [messed] up at the beginning. \"UK ID23, Female carer, daughter Emotional response from visitors and residents/Intensity of emotions\"She gives a bit of a blank look now at me. It 's really hard, it 's almost like she relies on the staff now which is nice in one way. Because they 're with her 24/7 but it 's like she got upset and hugs them and I 'm sat across the glass thinking [wanting to be] holding her hand and me giving her the hug. \" UK ID10, female carer, daughter THEME 4: Compliance to guidelines and regulationsRespecting the importance of guidelines \"It was quite easy to follow all the rules. It 's fine like this. Luckily, my father isn't really much of a hugger, so keeping distance is also easy. \"Dutch ID 0512E7, son of resident \"I think he 's probably getting used to people wearing PPE all the time, particularly in the hospital so he was fairly laid back about it yesterday andI was able to hold his hand because I was wearing gloves as well so thatwas good. Because that touch is so important. \"UK ID28, family carer Difficulties with adhering to guidelines \"Not touching belongings is impossible. I brought clean laundry for my mother and put those in the closet. I also wanted to make coffee for meand my mother, which is something that you normally do when visiting.The staff did not want me to do that, but allowed it anyway. It is alsostrange that I was not allowed to bring strawberries that I prepared athome. After all, I did disinfect my hands an extra time. \"Dutch (ID0512E3) \"I thought how can you leave someone who 's got, who can 't hear and there 's face masks on so can 't lipread and has not mental capacity to quite understand and grasp and that 's, I felt like she was just left you know and it was like oh my god I wouldn 't even do that to my dog. \"UK ID17, female carer, daughterCare home visiting during the pandemic 7 https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002799 Published online by Cambridge University PressDifculties with adhering to guidelines While family carers mostly respected the guidelines, some familymembers also expressed how dif cult it was to adhere to them in both countries. They missed the personal touch and struggled keeping a physicaldistance from their relative when on a face-to-face visit. It seemed unnatural to keep a distance from their relative who they have not seen for a long time.Others also mentioned the dif culties of wearing masks when on visits, and the dif culties in engaging with their relative this way, as the person withdementia cannot see facial features and the family member smiling for example, and also may struggle recognizing the family member. This was also raisedby a UK family carer in light of staff wearing PPE in the care homes which appeared to cause dif culties and in the carer 's eyes, a care neglect. Discussion This is one of the rst studies to explore the impact of the pandemic on visiting care home residents and comparing the experiences across two cultural set-tings. While remote and the new normal alternative types of face-to-face visits were available, they were unable to replace genuine face-to-face visits in bothcountries. The difference between countries was that the Netherlands had quickly implemented blan- ket guidance on care home visitation, enabling afaster and smoother transition to reuniting family members with residents again. Removing any face-to-face contact between family members and residents and creating a care home contact bubble has detrimental effects on the well- being of both parties involved. During the pandemic,alternative face-to-face visi ts such as window, pod, or garden visits have become the norm, where they were available and enabled by care home staff. In addition,remote digital connections between family members and residents also have become the new norm, re flect- ing what has occurred in community settings for peoplewith dementia and carers try ing to engage with support services (Arighi et al.,2021;G i e b e l et al.,2021). W h i l et h e s ew e r eal i f e l i n et os t a yi nc o n t a c tw i t h relatives to some degree, many family members faced difculties in engaging with different face-to-face visits in the UK. This was because of a lack of clear guidancefor care homes, whereas in the Netherlands, guidance was released and implemented early on in the pandemic in May 2020. Thus, comparing the data from these twocountries with very different levels of government input as to how visiting should operate, ndings indicate how Dutch family members have bene ted to a greater degree from these alternative visits, leaving many UK family members excluded from care homes for longperiods of time.While guidelines were helpful in the Netherlands in enabling visits relatively early on in the course ofthe pandemic, family members in both countriesexpressed how they respected and understood thegeneral public health measures (such as social dis- tancing, wearing PPE). However, they also raised the dif culties they experienced by not holding a relative 's hand on a visit especially for those with sensory de cits. Considering the emotional turmoil experienced by lack of contact between residents and family members, and the restricted nature of contact. Findings indicate the signi cance of social contact and their impact on mental well-being, asevidenced outside the care home sector during thepandemic and in pre-pandemic times (Domenech- Abella et al.,2019 ; Cations et al.,2021 ; Cohen et al., 2020 ). This is also captured in a recent international report on the care home visiting, which provides ve major recommendations which are corroborated byourndings: avoiding blanket visitor bans; safe alternative face-to-face visits; essential partner status for family carers; government support for imple-menting safe visiting; and ensuring the human rightsof residents are met, not depriving them of theirbasic rights of seeing friends and family (Low et al., 2021 ). Restrictions in care homes thus need to be mindful of the individual resident 's needs, rather than a blanket ban on family members per se. If not,care homes indeed risk, and have risked, humanrights violations, also in light of quarantining resi- dents with dementia against their will (and under- standing) (Iaboni et al.,2020 ) so that Low ' set al. 's (Low et al.,2021 ) recommendations should be im- plemented across care homes, particularly in coun- tries where governmental guidance is missing. This lack of government guidance has left care homes across the UK, and globally, without clearguidance about how to manage infection risks as wellas to manage the residents 'well-being or justify the choices they make in this regard. There was no clear guidance on how to provide care safely toresidents, and care homes had to come up with theirown strategies of how to deliver care, but also how toenable or minimize outside visits (from family members and friends) in order to reduce the spread of the virus. In addition, procuring PPE remains a signi cant issue for many care homes and social care staff more broadly(Carter, 2020; McGarry et al.,2020). Without any guidance, and staff more likely to work across different care homes, infection risks and COVID-19 outbreaksare higher (Ladhani et al.,2020). Thus, a key message from this pandemic and from this study is the impor-tance of clear communication to care homes, and family members, in case of future pandemics or future waves of COVID-19. While data were collected prior to vaccination roll- outs, ndings have implications for vaccination ready8 C. Giebel et al. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610221002799 Published online by Cambridge University Presscare homes as well, as well as for new COVID-19 waves with new variants which are not targeted bycurrent vaccines. In light of a large vaccination roll-out in the UK since early December 2020, from 8 March and the 29 March 2021, one and two essential visitors, respectively, have been allowed into the care homes again while strictly adhering to public health guidance. Although this guidance was released, it was notimplemented in all care homes in March, with factors of low uptake of vaccination in care home staff likely also affecting family visitation (Giebel et al. ,) .I n contrast, in the Netherlands, it is now illegal to impose a full lockdown on care homes, something that has not been enshrined in law in the UK, yet. However, thereis no evidence to date on how these guidelines are implemented in practice, and future research needs to explore the effects of vaccina tions and new visitation rules on residents and family members. While this study bene ts from a cross-country exploration of the topic and thus wider representa-tiveness of the ndings, it is to be noted that this study only focused on family carers. These also shared an insight on how residents were faring during thosevisits, but ndings are restricted to their perspectives. Considering the barriers of getting ethical approval to conduct interviews with residents in the UK, linkedwith the inability to go into care homes to collect data, obtaining the views from family carers are a suitable avenue of obtaining data. Family carers completing ashort interview in the Netherlands were all from one care home, thereby reducing the wider representa- tiveness of the short interviews while providing a richpicture of the different experiences of family carers. Longer interviews were conducted across different sites. Another limitation is that the topic guides inboth countries were not the same, yet asked similar questions and thus focused on the same topic, mak- ing it possible to compare the data from both studies. Conclusions Care homes require clear guidance to be able to dealwith infection control effectively and manage newways of care delivery. While new forms of visiting, such as window and pod visits, as well as remote digital connections, do not provide the same level ofconnection between family members and residents as pre-pandemic face-to-face visits do, enabling these well and frequently to all family members and resi-dents can help reduce some of the emotional burden felt by lack of contact. Considering patchy vaccina- tion roll out worldwide, and new variants foundregularly which may impede the bene ts of existing vaccinations, we can take important learnings from this international study and provide strong recom-mendations for improved, early, and clear guidancefor care delivery and visitation, and the enablement of (alternative) face-to-face visits as much as possible.The early implementation of care home visitation in the Netherlands has highlighted the bene ts of care home visitation, if properly supported through infor-mation and support for visitors, staff, and residents, which should be provided in future outbreaks in care h o m e sa c r o s st h ew o r l d .
