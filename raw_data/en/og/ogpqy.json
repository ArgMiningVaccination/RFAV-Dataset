The intent o f this document is to ensure that the levels of evidence for SE are rigorous enough to protect public health and maintain consumer confidence, while providing a clearly defined pathway to bring into the market discipline -specific complementary medicines. It should be read together with the current versions of the following guidelines, including those referred to therein: 7.03 Complementary Medicines - Use of the ZA CTD format in the preparation of a registration application 7.04 Complementary Medicine s - Health Supplements: Safety and Efficacy 7.05 Complementary Medicines - Quality 2.24 Guidance for the submission of the South African CTD/eCTD - General & Module 1 2.01 General Information 2.03 Alcohol content of medicines 2.04 Post -Importation testing 2.05 Stability 2.06 Biostudies 2.07 Dissolution 2.08 Amendments 2.14 Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) 2.15 Proprietary Names for Medicines 2.16 Package Inserts for Human Medicines 2.25 Pharmaceutical and Ana lytical - CTD/eCTD 2.36 Scheduling of Medicines 4.01 Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicines in South Africa 16.01 Guideline for Licence to Manufacture, Import or Export and the forms: Application for Registration of a Medicine - South African Common Technical Document (ZACTD) 6.15 Screening Template for new application for registration 6.10 Licence Application to Manufacture, Import or Export Medicine ii) Scope and Overview This SE Guideline applies to discipline specific complementary medicines (Category D) for human use. In addition, the requirements and restrictions outlined in this document do not apply to compounded medicines in terms of Section 14(4) of the Act. In genera l Complementary Medicines (CMs) are used and sold by many people in the RSA. These guidelines accompany the regulations dealing with the registration and post -marketing control of these medicines. The guidelines give some direction with regard to the req uired information for disciplinespecific CMs but should not in themselves be regarded as final. Where an applicant wishes to use and submit information not found in these guidelines, they may do so, but they would have to make thoroughly justified submiss ions on scientific, technical or traditional grounds. Page 4 of 46 To C The CMs that will be the subject to these Guidelines are those associated with those disciplines as determined by Council. Currently six major disciplines have been identified and p reparations associated 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Regis tration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 7 of 51 Back to ToC Back to therewith, namely: Homeopathy, Western Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Unani Medicine (Unani -Tibb) and Aromatherapy . In addition, a seventh category - Combination Products - is recognised and dealt with below. The disciplines of CMs are defined in this guideline and evidence required to substantiate the claims made for products falling under any of the disciplines, i s divided into high risk or low risk categories. For all CMs, quality and safety are non -negotiable, whereas, depending upon the discipline, proof of absolute efficacy may prove challenging, for a variety of reasons, and therefore concessions have been made in this area for tradition (discipline) based CMs that have a long history of use. All manufacturers of CMs will be subject to compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). In the process of complying with these practices the quality of the med icines is promoted and aimed at rendering them to be of acceptable quality, safety and efficacy. The approach of these guidelines is to enable the applicant to present, to the SAHPRA, an application free of errors and easy to review. Each discipline wil l have its own set of requirements governed by its own references and pharmacopoeiae which are all subject to and compliant with the current science and knowledge of that particular discipline. Other relevant Guidelines of the SAHPRA should be consulted where necessary. Where guidelines are referred to, the latest (current) version should be used. Discipline specific complementary medicines will be subject to the Scheduling of Medicines Guideline. CMs are not scheduled solely on the basis of toxicity. Although toxicity is one of the factors considered, the decision to include a substance in a particular Schedule also takes into account many other criteria such as the purpose of use, potential for misuse, abuse, safety in use, the need for specialised (professional) knowledge in its prescription and the need for the substance. Before submitting an application for registration of a complementary medicine, it is first necessary to establish that the product contains substances that are, in fact, confirme d to relate to the relevant discipline and/or health supplements. ANNEXURE A is included to help decide what would be regarded as a Category D substance, while ANNEXURES B and C describe the process of determination of relevant disciplines and origin of substances. 1.1 Definitions i) The definition of a complementary medicine (CM) is provided as: \"Complementary medicine\" means any substance or mixture of substances that \u2014 (a) originates from plants, fungi, algae, seaweeds, lichens, minerals, animals or other substance as determined by Council, and (b) is used or purporting to be suitable for use or manufactured or sold for use \u2014 (i) in maintaining, complementing, or assisting the innate healing power or physical or mental state, or (ii) to diagnose, treat, mitigate, modify, alleviate or prevent disease or illness or the symptoms or signs thereof or abnormal physical or mental state, of a human being or animal, and (c) is used \u2014 (i) as a health supplement, or (ii) in accordance with those disciplines as determined by Council, or (d) is declared by the Minister, on recommendation by the Council , by notice in the Gazette to be a complementary medicine. ii) The definition of a health supplement (HS) is provided as: \"Health supplement\" means any substance, extract or mixtur e of substances that \u2014 Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 8 of 51 Back to ToC Page (a) may\u2014 (i) supplement the diet; ii) have a nutritional physiological effect; or iii) include pre - and probiotics classified as schedule 0; and (b) are sold in pharmaceutical dosage forms not usually associated with a foodstuff and excludes injectables or substances schedule 1 or higher. iii) The definition of a combination product is provided as: Combination product means a single product that contain s: (a) a mixture of substances of different discipline -specific origins or philosophies; (b) a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more health supplements; or (c) a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific o rigin and one or more of its isolated constituents. 1.1.1 Active Ingredients Intended for Medicines Compounded in terms of Section 14(4) The provisions of registration do not apply to Active Ingredients / raw materials that are supplied to practition ers for the purposes of compounding in terms of Section 14(4) of the Act. The exclusions relating to compounding apply where a practitioner prepares a medicine for an individual patient either following consultation with that particular patient, or to fil l a prescription for that particular patient. This policy recognises the one -off nature of such medicines, the professional training and licensing of the practitioner to prepare a medicine for the specific needs of an individual patient. (This does not inc lude otherwise available proprietary products or bona fide medicines for sale to the general public) Manufacturers of substances for supply to individual practitioners for use in compounded medicines shall be duly licensed as a manufacturer or wholesaler and supply active ingredients / raw materials to registered and duly licensed practitioners only, prov ided that supply of such substance shall only be made to practitioners who are holders of combined dispensing and compounding licences as contemplated by Section 22C of the Act. 1.2 Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Laboratory Pract ice (GLP) and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) All manufacturers of complementary medicines shall comply with all relevant aspects of Good Manufacturing Practice as outlined in the latest version of the SAHPRA's \"GUIDE TO GOOD MANUF ACTURING PRACTICE FOR MEDICINES IN SOUTH AFRICA\" and Good Laboratory Practice as well as the WHO Guidelines on Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) for Medicinal Plants, if applicable. Any alternative standards must be specified, referenced and justified. 1.3 Format of submission Data provided in applications for registration of complementary medicines should be in the latest version of the Common Technical Document (ZA -CTD) format as published by the SAHPRA. 1.4 Types of Substances and Preparations 1.4.1 Herbal substance / preparation Herbal substance / preparation, in any discipline, means all or part of a plant, fungus, alga, seaweed or lichen, or other substance: a) that is obtained only by drying, crushing, distilling, freezing, fermentation, lyophilisation, extracting, expressing, comminuting, mixing with an inert diluent substance or another herbal Regis tration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 9 of 51 Back to ToC Page Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 10 of 51 Back to ToC substance or mixing with water, ethanol, glycerol, oil or aqueous ethanol; or other permitted solvents; with or without the addition of heat; b) that is not subjected to any other treatment or process other than a treatment or process that is necessary for its presentation in a pharmaceutical dosage form; c) where part of a plant, fungus, seaweed or lichen refers to a structure such as rhizome, mycelium, fruiting body, or bark, wood, meristematic tissue, shoot, bud, thallus, resin, oleoresin, gum, natural exudate or secretion, gall, leaf, frond, flower (or its parts), inflorescence, pollen, frui t, seed, cone, spores or other whole plant part; and d) that does not include: i. a pure chemical or isolated constituent unless the isolated herbal constituent is formulated with the herbal substance from which it arises and is demonstrated to have \"e ssentially the same\"1 action as the whole herbal substance; or ii. a substance of mineral, animal or bacterial origin. 1.4.2 Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Unani Tibb substances Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Unani Tibb substances, in additio n to herbal substances, may contain substances of animal or mineral origin. 1.4.3 Homeopathic substances / preparations Homeopathic substances / preparations may be a) of plant, fungal, animal, mineral or other origin prepared in accordance with home opathic principles and may include starting substances as well as allersodes, isodes, sarcodes, nosodes, allergens, and allopathic substances all used in potentised form at acceptable potencies for use as a homeopathic medicine; b) formulated for use based on homeopathic principles, which may include being capable of producing in a healthy person symptoms similar to those which it is administered to alleviate, or those principles related to classical, clinical or combination homeopathy; or c) prepared or purported to be prepared according to the practices of homeopathic pharmacy including starting substances using the methods described in a recognised pharmacopoeia which may include (i) serial dilution and succussion of a mother tincture in water, ethanol, aqueous ethanol or glycerol; or (ii) serial trituration in lactose, and may include electronic preparations, homotoxicology, biochemic tissue salts, spagyric therapy, gemmotherapy and lithotherapy 1.4.4 Aromatherapy substances Aromatherapy substances ar e essential (volatile) oils, hydrolates (hydrosols) or other aromatic extracts of plant origin where, reference must be made to the part of the plant(s) or the whole plant and method used to extract the essential oils. Synthetic aromatic compounds for me dicinal purposes should follow the Category A registration route. 1.4.5 Anthroposophical, Gemmotherapeutic, Spagyric Substances and Flower Essences In most cases these medicinal products cannot be distinguished on the basis of their methods of produc tion, as these are largely shared with other medicinal product groups such as homeopathic and western herbal medicinal products. In case of overlap, they will be qualified as either homeopathic or Western herbal medicines, or a combination based on their presentation in the product. 1 Guidance on equivalence of herbal extracts in complementary medicines ; https://www.tga.gov.au/publication/guidanc eequivalenc eherba l-extract s-complementar y-medicines#no t Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 11 of 51 Back to ToC Applicants are permitted to make use of applicable, in addition to the specific discipline on any l abelling, package insert, patient information leaflet of other product -related documentation . 1.5 The Naming of Substances and Ingredients used in Complementary Medicines The following naming conventions will be relevant for names of substance / ingredients used in Complementary Medicines in respect of any application for registration of such or on any product labelling thereof. 1.5.1 Chemical Substance Name The appro ved name i.e. International Non -Proprietary Name (INN) or chemical name of substances used must be stated. In the absence of such name being available, a chemical description or characterisation of the substance should be given. The approved name (INN) or chemical name of mineral, metal or chemical substances or prepared mineral substances used in Homeopathic, Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic or Unani Tibb medicines must be stated. 1.5.2 Biological Substance Name or Animal Substance Name In addition to the name of the organism, the part, preparation and / or biological descriptor may be required to fully name a biological or animal substance. 1.5.3 Herbal Name For purposes of the registration procedure, herbal names are stated in the Latin bino mial format, which must include the genus, species, subspecies, variety, sub -variety, form, sub -form or chemotype and author where appropriate. Reference must be made to the internationally accepted name for the plant, fungus or alga by referring to the fo llowing databases where appropriate (in order of priority): a) The Plant List (Available at: http://www.theplantlist.org) b) The Index Fungorum (Available at: http://www.indexfungorum.org) c) The International Plant Names Index (Available at: http://www.ipni.or g) d) OR other recognised major flora 1.5.3 Herbal Name - continued Examples of correct herbal names Latin binomial name (as above), the part and the preparation (including solvents and ratio if applicab le) are used to fully name a herbal ingredient. For purposes of labelling, a simple Latin binomial or pharmacopoeial names of herbal ingredients that are fully characterised in a monograph of an accepted pharmacopoeia may be used provided it is clear to the consumer exactly which herb (or part thereof) is being used. 1.5.4 Herbal Component Name (HCN) HCNs are names for classes of constituents that are found in herbal ingredients. The need for a HCN most often arises when a herbal extract is standar dised to a particular class of constituents, or where particular classes of constituents are restricted (e.g. hydroxyanthracene derivatives). Where a herbal Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 12 of 51 Back to ToC extract is standardised to a single constituent, the single constituent should have a chemical nam e. The HCN is not a stand -alone name and should be used only when expressing a herbal substance. 1.5.5 Common Names Common names, Materia Medica Names and/or Discipline -specific names (e.g.: Traditional Yin, Traditional Sanskrit or Tradit ional Unani Tibb Names) may be used in addition to the approved names. The Pin Yin name of the plant may also be used in addition to the English names of the plant parts in the case of Traditional Chinese medicines. 1.6 Multi -component Formulations and Combination Products 1.6.1 Multi -component Formulations For complementary medicines that contain multiple ingredients, the evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy also relies on the correct formulation of the prod uct according to the principles of the discipline from which it arises. It is recognised that traditional medicine disciplines have their own innate systems for assuring quality, safety and efficacy. An applicant should demonstrate that their product has been formulated carefully and correctly in accordance with the principles of the discipline from which it arises and, if a product is not formulated according to traditional principles, then the applicant must provide a detailed rationale as to why the in gredients in the product are combined and address any potential concerns about potential incompatibility (physical, chemical, traditional) of any of the constituent parts. New combinations of active ingredients previously used separately or in different combinations, must be suitably justified according to the philosophy / principles of the associated discipline, including consideration of principles that relate to the additive, synergistic or modulating effects and compatibility of the various ingredient s of a formula and the associated dosage justifications that these principles may merit. Each active ingredient must contribute to the overall efficacy of the medicine. Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 13 of 51 Back to ToC 1.6.2 Combination Products Refer to the definition of \"combination product\" as provided in 1.1. a) In the case of combination products of a mixture of substances of various discipline -specific origin or philosophy applicants will need to demonstrate an explicit , cogent rationale for use of all discipline -specific ingredients in the formula. b) In the case of combination products of a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more health supplements: detailed information must be provided to explain the rationale behind the inclusion of each substance together with the discipline -specific substances, and where any health supplements fall below minimum levels required for use of the associated health supplement claim, no claim re lated to its presence in the formula will be permitted. c) In the case of a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more of its isolated constituents: the isolated constituent must be formulated with the herbal substance from which it arises; and the action of the isolate must be \"essentially the same\" (not significantly different) (See 1.4.1) as the action of the herbal substance. In any instance (a, b or c) the registration sub -category will be \"Combination Product \" and the discipline(s) it relates to. 1.7 Accepted References The following references (in addition to any further specified accepted references [ANNEXURE D] for each discipline) should be consulted for purposes of motivating that the product or su bstances used originate from the discipline indicated.

Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 17 of 51 Back to ToC 2.4 Non-clinical Overview A bibliographic review of safety data together with a summary report, and where required, data necessary for assessing the safety of the medicinal product. The report on safety data should take into consideration the agreed format for the organisation of the non -clinical overview in the CTD. The list of relevant references for non -clinical data can be included at the end of module 2.4 Where a recognised monograph/reference standard has been established applicants should discuss this fact in the dossier taking into consideration that they do refer to the specific active ingredients and aspects related to the finished product. Furthermo re, the applicant will need to demonstrate that the proposed product contains the CM substances which correspond to a CM substance listed in the monograph. A literature research should be provided to fill the gap between the compilation of any recognised reference source and the application, providing information about the research strategy. The relevance of the newer data and/or unpublished, specific data has to be discussed in relation of the known properties of the herbal substance(s) and the possible impact of such data on the existing assessment. Module Heading Comments/Notes If the extract solvent and/or concentration is/are different from those given in the recognised reference/monograph, comparability has to be demonstrated by using appropriate analytical data. The same applies, if non -published data, which should be used ( e.g. tests on mutagenicity) is referring to different extract solvent and/or concentration. For combination products the assessment should not only focus on the single CM substances, but also an assessment of the combination is necessary. If risks have been identified, the report must explain why a positive benefit/risk -balance for a traditional use is justified. Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 18 of 51 Back to ToC 2.5 Clinical overview A bibliographical evidence or expert evidence to the effect that the medicinal product in question, or its ingredients or a corresponding product, has a history of traditional medicinal use (as per the definition in the guideline) within the Republic of South Africa or within a country, the regulatory authority of which the SAHPRA aligns itself with. The evidence provided by traditional use should not be overstated and should be applicable to the level of indication provided. Sufficient reference and guid ance as related to the claim and as per the guideline should be provided. Where reference is made to recognised: monographs or other reference standard: Sources may be quoted but copies of the relevant text extract must be provided; and Demonstration of how the product accords with such sources must be made. The plausibility of pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product as well as information on the safety of use should be addressed in this section. A summary of clin ical evidence should also be included where required. For combination products the assessment should not only focus on the single CM substances, but also an assessment of the combination is necessary. A bibliographic review of safety data together wit h an expert report, and where required, data necessary for assessing the safety of the medicinal product. Evidence of widespread, long -standing use without significant safety problems emerging should form the basis of a typical safety report. Deficiencies in safety information should also be clearly addressed. Module Heading Comments/Notes Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 19 of 51 Back to ToC The report should ideally consider the following aspects of safety: the nature of the patient population and the extent of patient exposure/world -wide marketing experience to date common and non -serious adverse events serious adverse events methods to prevent, mitigate or manage adverse events reactions due to overdose long-term safety if relevant data is available special patient populations e.g. children and pregnant or lactating women relevant animal toxicology and product quality information If risks have been identified, the report must explain why a positive benefit/risk -balance for a traditional use is justified. For example, if there are reports of serious adverse events, this m ust be balanced by sufficient evidence of appropriate benefit. In summary, 5 pivotal pieces of information must be discussed in this section of the dossier a) traditional use b) therapeutic indication and associated clinical evidence where necessary c) strength/type of substance d) posology e) specific information on safe use and evidence of safety 2.3 Module 4: Non-clinical study reports Module Heading Comments/Notes 4.1 Table of contents of Module 4 4.2 Study Reports If data are available or have been requested these should be provided and summarised in Module 2.6, for which the corresponding non -clinical overview would be included in Module 2.4 Any reports or studies referenced should be provided in full.

Not all sections may be relevant to all applications, but applicants are advised to consider the appli cability of these comments to each application. Applications for the registration of complementary medicines must include appropriate data that demonstrate the safety of the product as provided for in these guidelines. Safety may be established by detai led reference to the published literature and/or the submission of original study data. A guiding principle should be that, if the product has been traditionally used without demonstrated harm, a review of the relevant literature should be provided with original articles or references to the original articles. If official monograph/review results exist, reference should be made to them. Toxicological studies, if available, should be part of the assessment. If a toxicological risk is known, relevant toxicity data must be submitted. The assessment of risk, whether independent of dose or related to dose, should be documented. The applicant must provide evidence (data) to support the product's efficacy for the proposed indication(s) and any claims that th e applicant intends to make in the product labelling to determine whether the data supplied adequately support the requested indication(s)/claim(s) as provided for in these guidelines. Proof of efficacy, including the documentation required to support t he indicated claims, should depend on the nature and level of the indications. For the treatment of minor disorders, for nonspecific indications, or for limited prophylactic uses, less stringent requirements (e.g. observational studies) may be adequate to prove efficacy, especially when the extent of traditional use and the experience with a particular herbal medicine and supportive pharmacological data are taken into account. Where traditional use has not been established, appropriate pre -clinical and/o r clinical evidence will be required, dependent on level of claim. 3.1 Well-documented Ingredients Where an active ingredient is well described in standard sources it is possible to use these descriptions as the basis of the efficacy and safety info rmation. 3.1 Well-documented Ingredients - continued The following are examples of the reference texts that are usually acceptable as sources of information on the safety, efficacy and dosage regimen of ingredients: Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference , Sweetman SC (ed), Pharmaceutical Press, United Kingdom Handbook of Non -Prescription Drugs, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, United States; Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 21 of 51 Back to ToC Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro AR (ed), Mack Publishing Company, United St ates; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, Kibbe AH (ed), American Society of Health System Pharmacists, United States; Other sources should primarily include evidence -based references, such as the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, and the Na tural Standard Databases. Note that indications and dosage must be the same as described in these sources. Any use outside the documented indications and/or dosages, or any new route of administration, will require evidence of efficacy and safety. Note also that anecdotal or limited clinical reports/mentions of efficacy alone (e.g. in Martindale, \"xxx has also been used in ...\") are not considered evidence of efficacy and safety. Applications for products with well -documented ingredients should includ e details of the relevant texts (photocopies or scans of the relevant pages are preferred) with particular references to the accepted indications, dosage and routes of administration of the active ingredients. Refer to excipients that are Generally Regarde d As Safe (GRAS) 3.2 Quality of Data Since the evidence to demonstrate efficacy and safety of products may be literature based, it is important that a critical appraisal on the quality of the data is provided. Applications based on the literature or on clinical trials should include: an index of contents; non-clinical and clinical overviews referenced to the submission by page number; full copies (not abstracts) of all relevant reports and clinical trials . The non -clinical and clinical overviews should include a critical appraisal of the quality of the data generated from each trial and the relevance of the results to the efficacy and safety of the product. Where more than one indication is claimed, each indication should be separately justified in relation to the data included in the submission. Where more than one active ingredient is included in the product, the rationale for the inclusion of each active ingredient must be stated and justified. The inclusion of each active ingredient and the intended use of the product as a whole should be justified in terms of each ingredient's and the product as a whole's efficacy and safety. For adverse events, the overview should provide, in humans, an assessment of overall incidence, seriousness, causality of effects, dose -response relationship, special population subgroups such as the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and an indication of reve rsibility or otherwise. 3.2 Quality of Data - continued Where available an evidence -based approach using predetermined levels of evidence (e.g. systematic review and meta -analysis; randomised controlled trial; expert opinion) combined with a grading of the quality of the evidence should be developed. In compiling a literature -based submission it is not appropriate to simply collect and submit a few favourable published papers. The applicant must demonstrate that: the relevant peer -reviewed lite rature provided has been methodically investigated; the range of sources selected for submission is justified, and Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 22 of 51 Back to ToC issues and concerns raised in the literature in relation to the product or its ingredients have been addressed. 3.3 Benefits and Risks - Conclusion The evaluation of high -level claims (i.e. for the use of medicines for serious diseases) requires an assessment of the differential between the benefits of a medicine and the risks of its use. There is no simple measure fo r this: the acceptable level of risk varies with the nature of the benefits, the risk from taking the medicine and the risks of untreated (and undiagnosed) diseases. Generally, the more serious and life threatening the untreated disease and the greater t he benefit, the higher is the level of acceptable risk. The benefit -risk profile is also affected by the availability of accepted (proven) treatments, the risk profile of those accepted therapies, and the risks of foregoing treatment where such a medically acceptable option is available. A benefits risk profile should be determined for every high risk complementary medicine (refer to Table 1). 3.4 Clinical Trials of Complementary Medicines Where clinical trials are referenced, proposed or used, the r elevant guidelines for clinical trials should be consulted and are available on the SAHPRA website or from the office of the CEO. 4 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 4.1 Criteria for determining the safety of indications and health claims The indications and health claims will be classified into two risk levels, namely High and Low risk indications or claims, as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Risk Level, type of claim and evidence required Risk Level Type of Claim Evidence required to support claim HIGH RISK Treats/cures/manages any disease/disorder. Prevention of any disease or disorder. Reduction of risk of a disease/disorder. Aids/assists in the management of a named symptom/disease/ disorder. Relief of symptoms of a named disease or disorder2 Treatment of proven vitamin or mineral deficiency diseases. Clinical data to be evaluated 3. AND Two of the following four sources that demonstrates adequate support for the indications claimed: 1 Recognised Pharmacopoeia 4; 2 Recognised Monograph 4; 3 Three independent written histories of use in the classical or traditional medical literature, or 4 Citations from other in vivo, in vitro studies, case reports or others. Risk Level Type of Claim Evidence required to support claim Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 23 of 51 Back to ToC LOW RISK General health enhancement without any reference to specific diseases 1 Health maintenance, including nutritional support. Relief of minor symptoms (not related to a disease or disorder) 2 Clinical data to be evaluated 3 AND/OR: Two of the following four sources that demonstrates adequate support for the indications claimed: 1 Recognised Pharmacopoeia 4; 2 Recognised Monograph 4; 3 Three independent written histories of use in the classi cal or traditional medical literature. 5,6, or 4 Citations from other in vivo, in vitro studies, case reports or others. 1 Health enhancement claims apply to enhancement of normal health. They do not relate to enhancement of health from a compromi sed state. 2 All claims relating to symptoms must be accompanied by the advice \"If symptoms persist consult your healthcare practi tioner\". 3 Refer to section 5.1 i) - vi) 4 Refer to section 5.1 vii) - ix) and ANNEXURE D 5 In cultures where an oral tradition is clearly documented, evidence of use from an oral tradition would be considered accepta ble provided the history of use is au thenticated. Modern texts that accurately report or confirm the classical or traditional literature may be used to support claims. Traditional claims should refer to corresponding traditional descriptions of the condition(s). 6 Terms used must be in accor dance with the practice of the associated discipline. 4.2 Documenting safety 4.2.1 Safety The safety section should include the following: overview of safety; any studies that address specific safety issues; reports (where possible) of adverse effects reported to the National Adverse Drug Event Monitoring Centre reports of adverse effects from accepted international sources any studies not submitted in the efficacy section that have been referred to in the overview; post- marketing data. Full evidence of tissue residue data of products which have been used in animals destined for human consumption must be included. There is no need to submit duplicate copies of studies submitted in the efficacy section. However, the location of the studies in the application should be clearly identified. 4.2.2 Overview of Safety The overview of safety provides a concise criti cal assessment of the safety data, noting how the results may support and justify any restrictions placed on the product. The safety profile of the medicine may be motivated using relevant in vitro, in vivo evidence or clinical studies. The data should b e outlined in a detailed, clear and objective manner. Tabulations of adverse events are often helpful. 4.2.2 Overview of Safety - continued Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 24 of 51 Back to ToC There should be a description of common and expected adverse events (both serious and nonserious). An accepted causality assignment determination protocol to show the relationship between the product and an event, or lack of relationship, should be provid ed. The following issues should be considered: the use of the term \"natural\" should not be used to infer safety; all known interactions should be considered and detailed in the application process; adverse effects that are expected because of the mechanism of action; any likely adverse effects anticipated from animal data or product quality information (manufacturing processes); the nature of the patient population and the extent of exposure; any limitations of the safety data derived from th e clinical trials (e.g. inclusion/exclusion criteria, trial subject demographics); an outline of safety data collection in efficacy trials, with appropriate definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events, etc.; relationship of adverse events to do se, dose regimen and treatment duration; similarities and differences in results among studies, and their effect on the interpretation of the safety data; any differences in the rates of adverse events in population subgroups, such as those defined by demographic factors, gender, age, race, weight, concomitant illness or concomitant therapy;2 long-term safety; any methods to prevent, mitigate or manage adverse events; overdose reactions, potential for dependence, rebound phenomena and abuse, or th e lack of data on these aspects evidence of lack of efficacy. 4.3 Post Marketing Data The applicant should include all data on the worldwide marketing experience, including all relevant PostMarketing data available to the applicant. This may incl ude published and unpublished data. Any new or different safety issues identified following marketing and thereafter should be highlighted and any regulatory action relating to safety taken by an overseas regulatory agency should be detailed. Details o f the number of people estimated to have been exposed should be provided and categorised, as appropriate, by indication, dosage, route of administration, treatment duration and geographical location. This usually requires special \"pharmacovigilance\" techni ques such as prescription event monitoring. The data should be presented as a tabulation of the adverse events that have been reported, including any serious adverse events using the definition of SAE's in the SAHPRA's ADR guideline and any potentially serious interactions with other medicines. Furthermore, the applicant should collect, collate and maintain a record of all adverse reactions after they have been reported for the registered product and this should be available for inspection to the SAHPR A in accordance with the ADR guideline (Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions in South Africa). 5 EFFICACY Table 1 should be consulted to determine the type of evidence required to substantiate a claim. 2 Because of greater awareness of the potential for interactions between concomitantly administered medicines, there has been a n international focus on interaction studies rather than on ad hoc observational studies. Guidance on points to consider when ass essing interaction studies is given in CPMP/EWP/560/9 5. Additional information is contained in the US FDA CDER Guidance - Drug Metabolism/Drug Interaction Studies in the Drug Development Process: Studies In Vitro (April 1997 ) - CLIN 3.

Generally acceptable evidence in support of efficacy include: (i) Appropriately designed clinical trials using the product for which an application is being made. (ii) Appropriately designed qualitative and observational studies prefera bly using South Africanvalidated instruments/methods. (iii) Published systematic reviews such as in the Cochrane database. (iv) Published clinical trials (v) Published case reports (vi) Evidence -based databases (e.g. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, Natural Standards Database) (vii) Accepted Herbal monographs or pharmacopoeiae. (viii) Monographs from any other source equivalent in standard to any of the above. (ix) In the case of homeopathic medicines, justification of the use of the medicines from the relevant Materia Medica or Repertory listing. 5.2 Documenting efficacy The efficacy must be documented from studies in humans for human complementary medicines relevant to high risk leve l claims. 5.2.1 Information to include The efficacy section of the application should consist of the following: an overview and summaries; (Modules 2E / 2.5. 2.7) study reports and/or publications. (Module 5) 5.2.2 Study Reports and/or Publications If a clinical trial has been conducted by the applicant of the product then a study report should be provided. The study report should be written to comply with prescribed guidelines. As stated in the guideline, the s tructure and format required is intended to assist applicants in the development of a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well organised and easy to review. It is therefore important that all the headings in the guideline are used. If no inform ation is available for a particular heading, an explanation for the lack of information should be provided. Appendices 3 and 4, containing case record forms and individual patient data listings, are not required. 5.2.2 Study Reports and/or Publications - continued If the applicant's study has been published, the published paper should also be included. It is important that the applicant ensures that the data in the study report and the publication are consistent. Any differences should be explained in detail. Evidence of non -interference by the applicant and the independence of the researchers must be given. If in-house studies are done this must be explicit and all steps taken to reduce bias disclosed. Registration of Medicines CMs DS Safety & Efficacy 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun16_v3.doc June 2016 Page 26 of 51 Back to ToC 6 SCHEDULING Any motivation or proposal of a scheduling status should consider the safety of the medicine, level of indication and suitably justify for the level of access associated with the proposed schedule. 7 UNACCEPTABLE PRESENTATION The presentation (including package inserts, patient information leaflets, labelling and packaging) of complementary medicines is unacceptable if it is capable of being misleading or confusing as to the content or proper use of the medicines. Particular c are must be taken in South Africa to ensure that any translation of languages is not only accurate, but idiomatically sound so that incorrect messages are not conveyed. In addition, the presentation of complementary medicines is unacceptable: if the wo rds \"natural\" and \"gentle\" are used to imply safety if it states or suggests that the product has ingredients, components or characteristics that it does not have; if a name applied to the product is the same as the name applied to other products that are already supplied in South Africa, where those other products contain additional or different therapeutically active ingredients (refer to the current SAHPRA Naming Guideline); if the label of the product does not declare the presence of a therapeutic ally active ingredient; if a form of presentation of the product may lead to unsafe use of the product or suggests a purpose that is not in accordance with conditions applicable to the sale of the product in South Africa, or could be confused with an exi sting registered or unregistered \"brand\"; or if the format of the submissions does not comply with current SAHPRA guidelines. In such a case, the submission may be returned to the applicant and any fee forfeited. 8 GLOSSARY OF TERMS This glossar y is not exhaustive and does not include all terms applicable to the regulation of medicines and medical devices.
