Regulation Z protects people when they use consumer credit.", "sitename": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau", "date": null, "cleaned_text": "balances; account termination. (a) Credit balances. When a credit balance in excess of $1 is created on a credit account (through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer), the creditor shall: 1. Timing of refund. The creditor may also fulfill its obligations under \u00a7 1026.11 by: i. Refunding any credit balance to the consumer immediately. ii. Refunding any credit balance prior to receiving a written request (under \u00a7 1026.11(a)(2)) from the consumer. iii. Refunding any credit balance upon the consumer's oral or electronic request. iv. Making a good faith effort to refund any credit balance before 6 months have passed. If that attempt is unsuccessful, the creditor need not try again to refund the credit balance at the end of the 6-month period. 2. Amount of refund. The phrases any part of the remaining credit balance in \u00a7 1026.11(a)(2) and any part of the credit balance remaining in the account in \u00a7 1026.11(a)(3) mean the amount of the credit balance at the time the creditor is required to make the refund. The creditor may take into consideration intervening purchases or other debits to the consumer's account (including those that have not yet been reflected on a periodic statement) that decrease or eliminate the credit balance. (1) Credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer's account; (2) Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer; 1. Written requests - standing orders. The creditor is not required to honor standing orders requesting refunds of any credit balance that may be created on the consumer's account. (3) Make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer, any part of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months. No further action is required if the consumer's current location is not known to the creditor and cannot be traced through the consumer's last known address or telephone number. 1. Good faith effort to refund. The creditor must take positive steps to return any credit balance that has remained in the account for over 6 months. This includes, if necessary, attempts to trace the consumer through the consumer's last known address or telephone number, or both. 2. Good faith effort unsuccessful. Section 1026.11 imposes no further duties on the creditor if a good faith effort to return the balance is unsuccessful. The ultimate disposition of the credit balance (or any credit balance of $1 or less) is to be determined under other applicable law. (b) Account termination. (1) A creditor shall not terminate an account prior to its expiration date solely because the consumer does not incur a finance charge. 1. Expiration date. The credit agreement determines whether or not an open-end plan has a stated expiration (maturity) date. Creditors that offer accounts with no stated expiration date are prohibited from terminating those accounts solely because a consumer does not incur a finance charge, even if credit cards or other access devices associated with the account expire after a stated period. Creditors may still terminate such accounts for inactivity consistent with \u00a7 1026.11(b)(2). (2) Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section prohibits a creditor from terminating an account that is inactive for three or more consecutive months. An account is inactive for purposes of this paragraph if no credit has been extended (such as by purchase, cash advance or balance transfer) and if the account has no outstanding balance. (c) Timely settlement of estate debts \u2014 1. Administrator of an estate. For purposes of \u00a7 1026.11(c), the term \"administrator\" means an administrator, executor, or any personal representative of an estate who is authorized to act on behalf of the estate. 2. Examples. The following are examples of reasonable procedures that satisfy this rule: i. A card issuer may decline future transactions and terminate the account upon receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death. ii. A card issuer may credit the account for fees and charges imposed after the date of receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death. iii. A card issuer may waive the estate's liability for all charges made to the account after receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death. iv. A card issuer may authorize an agent to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule. v. A card issuer may require administrators of an estate to provide documentation indicating authority to act on behalf of the estate. vi. A card issuer may establish or designate a department, business unit, or communication channel for administrators, such as a specific mailing address or toll-free number, to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule. vii. A card issuer may direct administrators, who call a general customer service toll-free number or who send correspondence by mail to an address for general correspondence, to an appropriate customer service representative, department, business unit, or communication channel to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this rule. 2. Request by an administrator of an estate. A card issuer may receive a request for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account in writing or by telephone call from the administrator of an estate. If a request is made in writing, such as by mail, the request is received on the date the card issuer receives the correspondence. 3. Timely statement of balance. A card issuer must disclose the balance on a deceased consumer's account, upon request by the administrator of the decedent's estate. A card issuer may provide the amount, if any, by a written statement or by telephone. This does not preclude a card issuer from providing the balance amount to appropriate persons, other than the administrator, such as the spouse or a relative of the decedent, who indicate that they may pay any balance. This provision does not relieve card issuers of the requirements to provide a periodic statement, under \u00a7 1026.5(b)(2). A periodic statement, under \u00a7 1026.5(b)(2), may satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1026.11(c)(2), if provided within 30 days of receiving a request by an administrator of the estate. 4. Imposition of fees and interest charges. Section 1026.11(c)(3) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees and finance charges due to a periodic interest rate based on balances for days that precede the date on which the card issuer receives a request pursuant to \u00a7 1026.11(c)(2). For example, if the last day of the billing cycle is June 30 and the card issuer receives a request pursuant to \u00a7 1026.11(c)(2) on June 25, the card issuer may charge interest that accrued prior to June 25. 5. Example. A card issuer receives a request from an administrator for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account on March 1. The card issuer discloses to the administrator on March 25 that the balance is $1,000. If the card issuer receives payment in full of the $1,000 on April 24, the card issuer must waive or rebate any additional interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance between March 25 and April 24. If the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000 on April 25, the card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25. If the card issuer receives a partial payment of $500 on April 24, the card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25. 6. Application to joint accounts. A card issuer may impose fees and charges on an account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. If only an authorized user remains on the account of a deceased consumer, however, then a card issuer may not impose fees and charges. [See interpretation of 11(c) Timely Settlement of Estate Debts in Supplement I](/rules-policy/regulations/1026/interp-11/#11-c-Interp) (1) General rule. (i) Reasonable policies and procedures required. For credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, card issuers must adopt reasonable written policies and procedures designed to ensure that an administrator of an estate of a deceased accountholder can determine the amount of and pay any balance on the account in a timely manner. (ii) Application to joint accounts. Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to the account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder remains on the account. (2) Timely statement of balance \u2014 (i) Requirement. Upon request by the administrator of an estate, a card issuer must provide the administrator with the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account in a timely manner. (ii) Safe harbor. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, providing the amount of the balance on the account within 30 days of receiving the request is deemed to be timely. (3) Limitations after receipt of request from administrator \u2014 (i) Limitation on fees and increases in annual percentage rates. After receiving a request from the administrator of an estate for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account, a card issuer must not impose any fees on the account (such as a late fee, annual fee, or over-the-limit fee) or increase any annual percentage rate, except as provided by \u00a7 [1026.55(b)(2).](../55/#b-2) (ii) Limitation on trailing or residual interest. A card issuer must waive or rebate any additional finance charge due to a periodic interest rate if payment in full of the balance disclosed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section is received within 30 days after disclosure.
