have a genuine desire to learn about the beauty and usefulness of mathematics and to many colleagues who have helped to shape my interest and philosophy of teaching life- science calculus.Preface This preface describes the main philosophy of the course, and serves as a guide to the student and to the instructor. It outlines reasons for the way that topics are organized, and how this organization is intended to help introduce rst year students to the major concepts and applications of differential calculus. The material for this book was collected during two decades of teaching calculus at the University of British Columbia, and benetted greatly from insights and ideas of colleagues, as well as questions, interest, and enthusiasm of students and instructors. Introduction to this book Calculus arose as a tool for solving practical scientic problems through the centuries. However, it is often taught as a technical subject with rules and for- mulas (and occasionally theorems), devoid of its connection to applications. In this course, the applications form an important focal point, with empha- sis on life sciences. This places the techniques and concepts into practical context, as well as motivating quantitative approaches to biology taught to undergraduates. While many of the examples have a biological flavour, the level of biology needed to understand those examples is kept at a minimum. The problems are motivated with enough detail to follow the assumptions, but are simplied for the purpose of pedagogy. The mathematical philosophy is as follows: Power functions, Polynominals, Rational functions Graph Sketching Application: when does growth balance mortalityWe start with basic observations about functions and graphs, with an emphasis on power functions and polynomials. We use elementary properties of a function to sketch its graph and to understand its shape, even before discussing derivatives; later we rene such graph-sketching skills. We consider useful ideas with biological implications even in this basic context. In fact, we discuss several examples in which two processes (such as growth and predation or nutrient uptake and consumption) are at balance. We show how setting up the relevant algebraic problem revels when such a balance can exist. We introduce the derivative in three complementary ways: (1) As a rate of change, (2) as the slope we see when we zoom into the graph of a function, and (3) as a computational quantity that can be approximated by a nite22 difference. We discuss (1) by rst dening an average rate of change over a nite time interval. We use actual data to do so, but then by rening the time interval, we show how this average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate, i.e. the derivative. This helps to make the idea of the limit more intuitive, and not simply a formal calculation. We illustrate (2) using a sequence of graphs or interactive graphs with increasing magnication. We illustrate (3) using simple computation that can be carried out on a spreadsheet. The actual formal denition of the derivative (while presented and used) takes a back-seat to this discussion. Derivatives of Power functions, Polynominals Rened Graph Sketching Optimization methods and applicationsThe next philosophical aspect of the course is that we develop all the ideas and applications of calculus using simple functions (power and polynomials) rst, before introducing the more elaborate technical calculations. The aim is to highlight the usefulness of derivatives for understanding functions (sketching and interpreting their behaviour), and for optimization problems, before having to grapple with the chain rule and more intricate computation of derivatives. This helps to illustrate what calculus can achieve, and decrease the focus on rote mechanical calculations. Chain Rule Derivatives of exponentials, etc.Once this entire \"tour\" of calculus is complete, we introduce the chain rule and its applications, and then the transcendental functions (exponentials and trigonometric). Both are used to illustrate biological phenomena (population growth and decay, then, later on, cyclic processes). Both allow a repeated exposure to the basic ideas of calculus - curve sketching, optimization, and applications to related rates. This means that the important concepts picked up earlier in the context of simpler functions can be reinforced again. At this point, it is time to practice and apply the chain rule, and to compute more technically involved derivatives. But, even more than that, both these topics allow us to informally introduce a powerful new idea, that of a differential equation.Exponential population growth Differential equations Application: What if growth does not balance mortality?By making the link between the exponential function and the differential equation dy/dx=ky, we open the door to a host of biological applications where we seek to understand how a system changes: how a population size grow? how does the mass of a cell change as nutrients are taken up and consumed? By revisiting our initial discussions, we identify the \"balance points\" as steady states, and we develop arguments to predict what changes with time would be observed. The idea of a deviation away from steady state also leads us to nd the behaviour of solutions to the differential equation dy/dt=a\u0000by. This leads to many useful applications. including the temperature of a cooling object, the level of drug in the bloodstream, simple chemical reactions, and many more.Slope eld and geometric analysis Qualitative predictions of a differential equation Applications to population growth and disease spreadUltimately, a rst semester calculus course is all about the applications of a derivative. We use this fact to explore nonlinear differential equations of the rst order, using qualitative sketches of the direction eld and the state space of the equation. Even though some of the (integration) methods for solving a differential equation are developed only in a second semester23 calculus course, we provide here the background to understanding what such equations are saying, and what they imply. These simple yet powerful qualitative methods allow us to get intuition to the behaviour of more realistic biological models, including density-dependent (logistic) growth and even the spread of disease. Many of the ideas here are geometric, and we return to interpreting the meaning of graphs and slopes yet again in this context. The idea of a computational approach is introduced and practiced in several places, as appropriate. We use simple examples to motivate linear approximation and Newton's method for nding zeros of a function. Later, we use Euler's method to solve a simple differential equation computationally. All these methods are based on the derivative, and most introduce the idea of an iterated (repeated) process that is ideally handled by computer or calculator. The exposure to these computational methods, while novel and sometimes daunting, provides an important set of examples of how properly understanding the mathematics can be used directly for effective design of computational algorithms.

Much of the plan described above had its beginnings while we were co-instructors in the 1990's at UBC. I am also grateful to recent colleagues, who have provided inspiration, input, and advice, and who have helped to shape the biological applications in the book. These include, most especially, Prof. Eric Cytrynbaum (UBC). Other notable influences came from Wes Maciejewski (San Jose State University) who rst suggested the idea of videos.

In this chapter, we study a family of simple functions, the power functions - those of the form f(x) =xn. Mastered Material Check 1. Can you dene function ? 2. Give an example of a polynomial function; a rational function.Our rst task is to understand properties of the members of this \"family\". We will see that basic observations of power functions such as x2,x3leads to insights into a biological problem of why the size of living cells is limited. Later, we use power functions as \" building blocks\" to construct polynomials, and rational functions . We then develop important approaches to sketch the shapes of the resulting graphs. 1.1 Power functions Section 1.1 Learning goals 1. Interpret the shapes of power functions relative to one another. 2.Justify that power functions with low powers dominate near the origin, and power functions with high powers dominate far away from the origin. 3. Identify the points of intersection of two power functions. Let us consider the power functions, that is functions of the form /_481Click on this link and then adjust the slider on this interactive desmos graph to see how the power naffects the shape of a power function in the rst quadrant.y=f(x) =xn, where nis a positive integer. Power functions are among the most elementary and \"elegant\" functions - we only need multiplications to compute their value at any point. They are thus easy to calculate, very predictable and smooth, and, from the point of view of calculus, very easy to handle. From Figure 1.1, we see that the power functions ( y=xnfor powers n= 2,:::,5) intersect at x=0andx=1. This is true for all positive integer powers. The same gure also demonstrates another fact helpful for curve-sketching: the greater the power n, the flatter the graph near the origin and the steeper26 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES the graph beyond x>1. This can be restated in terms of the relative size of the power functions. We say that close to the origin, the functions with lower powers dominate, while far from the origin, the higher powers dominate . 0.20.40.60.811.21.41234 x2x3x4x5 xy Figure 1.1: y=xn. All intersect at x=0,1. As the power nincreases, the graphs become flatter close to the origin, (0,0), and steeper at large x-values.More generally, a power function has the form y=f(x) =K\u0001xn where nis a positive integer and K, sometimes called the coefcient , is a constant. So far, we have compared power functions whose coefcient isK=1. We can extend our discussion to a more general case as well. Example 1.1 Find points of intersection and compare the sizes of the two power functions y1=axn,and y 2=bxm. where a and b are constants.

This comparison is a slight generalization of the previous discus- sion. First, we note that the coefcients aandbmerely scale the vertical behaviour (i.e. stretch the graph along the yaxis). It is still true that the two functions intersect at x=0; further, as before, the higher the power, the flatter the graph close to x=0, and the steeper for large positive or negative values ofx.

By applying these ideas, we can gain insight into why cells have a size limitation, as discussed in the next section. 1.2 How big can a cell be? A model for nutrient balance /facetime_videoA summary of the cell size model. We discuss what cell size is consistent with a balance between nutrient absorption and consumption in a cell.Section 1.2 Learning goals 1.Describe the derivation of a mathematical model for cell nutrient absorp- tion and consumption. 2.Use parameters ( k1,k2) rather than specic numbers in mathematical expressions. 3.Demonstrate the link between power functions in Section 1.1 and cell nutrient balance in the model. 4. Interpret the results of the model. Consider the following biologically motivated questions: What physical and biological constraints determine the size of a cell? Why do some size limitations exist? Why should animals be made of millions of tiny cells, instead of a just a few large ones? We already have enough mathematical prowess to address these questions - particularly if we assume a cell is spherical. Of course, this is often not the case. The shapes of living cells uniquely suit their functions. Many have long appendages, cylindrical parts, or branch-like structures. But here, we neglect all these beautiful complexities and look at a simple spherical cell because it sufces to answer our questions. Such mathematical simplica- tions can be very illuminating: they allow us to form a mathematical model . A mathematical model is just a representation of a real situation which sim- plies things by representing the most important aspects, and neglecting or idealizing complicating details. In this section, we follow a reasonable set of assumptions and mathemati- cal facts to explore how nutrient balance can affect and limit cell size. Building the model In order to build the model we make some simplifying assumptions and then restate them mathematically. We base the model on the following28 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES assumptions : r Figure 1.3: An assumed spherical cell absorbs nutrients at a rate proportional to its surface area S, but consumes nutrients at a rate proportional to its volume V.1. The cell is roughly spherical (See Figure 1.3). 2.The cell absorbs oxygen and nutrients through its surface. The larger the surface area, S, the faster the total rate of absorption. We assume that the rate at which nutrients (or oxygen) are absorbed is proportional to the surface area of the cell. 3.The rate at which nutrients are consumed (i.e., used up) in metabolism is proportional the volume, V, of the cell. The bigger the volume, the more nutrients are needed to keep the cell alive. We dene the following quantities for our model of a single cell: A=net rate of absorption of nutrients per unit time, C=net rate of consumption of nutrients per unit time, V=cell volume, S=cell surface area, r=radius of the cell.Mastered Material Check 6. What does \"A is proportional to B\" mean? 7. What might the units be for quantities A,C,V,Sandr? 8. Given your choices for 7., what are the units associated with k1,k2? We now rephrase the assumptions mathematically. By Assumption 2, the absorption rate, A, is proportional to S: this means that A=k1S, where k1is aconstant of proportionality . Since absorption and surface area are positive quantities, only positive values of the proportionality constant make sense, so k1must be positive. The value of this constant depends on properties of the cell membrane such as its permeability or how many pores it contains to permit passage of nutrients. By using a generic constant - called aparameter - to represent this proportionality constant, we keep the model general enough to apply to many different cell types. By Assumption 3, the rate of nutrient consumption, Cis proportional to V, so that C=k2V, where k2>0is a second (positive) proportionality constant. The value of k2 depends on the cell metabolism, i.e. how quickly it consumes nutrients in carrying out its activities. By Assumption 1, the cell is spherical, thus its surface area, S, and volume, V, are: S=4pr2,V=4 3pr3. (1.2)POWER FUNCTI ONS A S BUI LDIN G BLO CKS 29 Putting these facts together leads to the following relationships between nutrient absorption A, consumption C, and cell =\u00124 3pk2\u0013 r3.

Why are we considering different values of rin Example 1.3?A(r) =ar2,C(r) =cr3. Note: the powers are n=3 for consumption and n=2 for absorption. The discussion of power functions in Section 1.1 now contributes to our analysis of how nutrient balance depends on cell size. Nutrient balance depends on cell size In our discussion of cell size, we found two power functions that depend on the cell radius r, namely the nutrient absorption A(r)and consumption C(r) given in Eqns. (1.3) . We rst ask whether absorption or consumption of nutrients dominates for small, medium, or large cells. Example 1.3 (A ne balance) For what cell size is the consumption rate exactly balanced by the absorption rate? Which rate (consumption or absorp- tion) dominates for small cells? For large cells? Solution. The two rates \"balance\" graphs intersect) when A(r) =C(r))\u00124 3pk2\u0013 r3= A trivial solution to this equation is r=0. Note: this solution is not interesting biologically, but we should not forget it in mathematical analysis of such problems. Ifr6=0, then, canceling a factor of r2from both sides gives: r=3k1 k2. This means absorption and consumption rates are equal for cells of this size. For small r, the power function with the smaller power of r(namely A(r)) dominates, but for very large values of r, the power function with the30 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES higher power of r(namely C(r)) dominates. It follows that for smaller cells, absorption A\u0019r2is the dominant process, while for larger cells, consumption rateC\u0019r3dominates. We conclude that cells larger than the critical size r=3k1/k2are unable to keep up with the nutrient demand, and cannot survive since consumption overtakes absorption of nutrients. \u0006 Using the above simple geometric argument, we deduced that cell size has strong implications on its ability to absorb nutrients or oxygen quickly enough to feed itself. For these reasons, cells larger than some maximal size (roughly 1mm in diameter) rarely occur. A similar strategy also allows us to consider the energy balance and sustainability of life on Earth - as seen next, in Section 1.3. 1.3 Sustainability and energy balance on Earth Section 1.3 Learning goals 1.Justify the given mathematical model that describes the energy input and output on Planet Earth. 2. Use the given model to determine the energy equlibrium of the planet. The sustainability of life on Planet Earth depends on a ne balance be- tween the temperature of its oceans and land masses and the ability of life forms to tolerate climate change. As a follow-up to our model for nutrient balance, we introduce a simple energy balance model to track incoming and outgoing energy and determine a rough estimate for the Earth's temperature. We use the following basic assumptions: Mastered Material Check 11. Do you think Einis proportional to Earth's surface area or volume?1.Energy input from the sun, given the Earth's radius r, can be approximated as Ein= (1\u0000a)Spr2, (1.4) where Sis incoming radiation energy per unit area (also called the solar constant ) and 0\u0014a\u00141is the fraction of that energy reflected; ais also called the albedo , and depends on cloud cover, and other planet characteristics (such as percent forest, snow, desert, and ocean). 2.Energy lost from Earth due to radiation into space depends on the current temperature of the Earth T, and is approximated as Eout=4pr2esT4, (1.5) where eis the emissivity of the Earth's atmosphere, which represents the Earth's tendency to emit radiation energy.

Example 1.4 (Energy expressions are power functions) Explain in what sense the two forms of energy above can be viewed as power functions, and what types of power functions they represent. Solution. Both EinandEoutdepend on Earth's radius as the power \u0018r2. However, since this radius is a constant, it is not fruitful to consider it as an interesting variable for this problem (unlike the cell size example in Section 1.2). However, we note that Eoutdepends on temperatureas \u0018T4. (We might also select the albedo as a variable and in that case, we note that Ein depends linearly on the albedo a.) \u0006 Example 1.5 (Energy equilibrium for the Earth) Explain how the assump- tions above can be used to determine the equilibrium temperature of the Earth, that is, the temperature at which the incoming and outgoing radiation energies are balanced.

It is instructive to examine how this temperature depends on the constants in the problem, and how it is affected by cloud cover and greenhouse gas level.

In Figure 1.4(b) we notice that power functions with an odd power, such as y=x,y=x3 andy=x5are symmetric when rotated 180\u000eabout the origin. We adopt the term even function andodd function to describe such symmetry properties. More formally, f(\u0000x) =f(x)) f is an even function, f(\u0000x) =\u0000f(x)) f is an odd function Many functions are not symmetric at all, and are neither even nor odd. See Appendix C for further details. Example 1.6 Show that the function y =g(x) =x2\u00003x4is an even function Solution. Forgto be an even function, it should satisfy g(\u0000x) =g(x). Let us calculate g(\u0000x)and see if this requirement holds. We nd that g(\u0000x) = (\u0000x)2\u00003(\u0000x)4=x2\u00003x4=g(x). Here we have used the fact that (\u0000x)n= (\u00001)nxn, and that when nis even, (\u00001)n=1. \u0006 All power functions are continuous and unbounded : for x!\u00a5both even and odd power functions satisfy y=xn!\u00a5. For x!\u0000\u00a5, odd power functions tend to\u0000\u00a5. Odd power functions are one-to-one : that is, each value of yis obtained from a unique value of xand vice versa. This is not true for even power functions. From Fig 1.4 we see that all power functions go through the point (0,0). Even power functions have a local minimum at the origin whereas odd power functions do not.POWER FUNCTI ONS A S BUI LDIN G BLO CKS 33 Denition 1.1 (Local Minimum) A local minimum of a function f(x)is a point xminsuch that the value of fis larger at all sufciently close points. Formally, f (xmin\u0006e)>f(xmin)foresmall enough. Sketching a simple (two-term) polynomial Based on our familiarity with power functions, we now discuss functions made up of such components. In particular, we extend the discussion to polynomials (sums of power functions) and rational functions (ratios of such functions). We also develop skills in sketching graphs of these functions. Example 1.7 (Sketching a simple cubic polynomial) Sketch a graph of the polynomial /_481Adjust the slider to see how positive and negative values of the coefcient a affect the shape of this simple polynomial.y=p(x) =x3+ax. (1.6) How would the sketch change if the constant achanges from positive to negative? Solution. The polynomial in Eqn. (1.6) has two terms, each one a power function. Let us consider their effects individually. Near the origin, for x\u00190 the term axdominates so that, close to x=0, the function behaves as y\u0019ax. This is a straight line with slope a. Hence, near the origin, if a>0we would see a line with positive slope, whereas if a<0the slope of the line should be negative. Far away from the origin, the cubic term dominates, soMastered Material Check 17. Justify why the linear term dominates near the origin, while the cubic term dominates further out. 18. Sketch the graph of anyfunction with horizontal asymptote y=2. y\u0019x3 at large (positive or negative) xvalues. Figure 1.5 illustrates these ideas. In the rst row we see the behaviour of y=p(x) =x3+axfor large x, in the second for small x. The last row shows the graph for an intermediate range. We might notice that for a<0, the graph has a local minimum as well as a local maximum. Such an argument already leads to a fairly reasonable sketch of the function in Eqn. (1.6) . We can add further details using algebra to nd zeros - that is where y=p(x) =0. \u0006 Example 1.8 (Zeros) Find the places at which the polynomial Eqn. (1.6) crosses the x axis, that is, nd the zeros of the function y =x3+ax. Solution. The zeros of the polynomial can be found by setting y=p(x) =0) x3+ax=0) x3=\u0000ax.

The cubic \"arms\" y\u0019x3(top row) dominate for large x(far from the origin), while the linear part y\u0019ax(middle row) dominates near the origin. When these are smoothly connected (bottom row) we obtain a sketch of the desired polynomial. Shown here are three possibilities, for a<0,a=0,a>0, left to right. The value ofadetermines the slope of the curve near x=0and thus also affects presence of a local maximum and minimum (for a<0).This would have no solutions if ais a positive number, so that in that case, the graph crosses the xaxis only once, at x=0, as shown in Figure 1.5. If a is negative, then the minus signs cancel, so the equation can be written in the form x2=jaj and we would have two new zeros at Mastered Material Check 19. Find the zeros of y=x3+3x.x=\u0006p jaj. For example, if a=\u00001 then the function y=x3\u0000xhas zeros at x=0,1,\u00001. \u0006 Example 1.9 (A more general case) Explain how you would use the ideas of Example 1.7 to sketch the polynomial y=p(x) =axn+bxm.

The full behaviour is obtained by smoothly connecting these pieces of the graph. Finding zeros can rene the graph. \u0006 A step back. The reasoning used here is an important rst step in sketching the graph of a polynomial. In the ensuing chapters, we develop specialized methods to nd zeros of more complicated functions (using an approximation technique called Newton's method ). We also apply calculus tools to deter- mine points at which the function attains local maxima or minima (called critical points ), and how it behaves for very large positive or negative values ofx. That said, the elementary steps described here remain useful as a quick approach for visualizing the overall shape of a graph. Sketching a simple rational function We apply similar reasoning to consider the graphs of simple rational func- tions. A rational function is a function that can be written as y=p1(x) p2(x), where p1(x)andp2(x)are polynomials.

We can break up the process of sketching this function into the following steps: The graph of the function in Eqn. (1.7) goes through the origin (at x=0, we see that y=0). For very small x, (i.e., x<<a) we can approximate the denominator by the constant term an+xn\u0019an, since xnis negligible by comparison, so that y=Axn an+xn\u0019Axn an=\u0012A an\u0013 xnfor small x.

This reveals that the graph has a horizontal asymptote y=Aat large values ofx.36 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Since the function behaves like a simple power function close to the origin, we conclude directly that the higher the value of n, the flatter is its graph near 0.

Rational functions introduced in Example 1.10 often play a role in biochem- istry. Here we discuss two such examples and the contexts in which they appear. In both cases, we consider the initial rise of the function as well as its eventual saturation. Saturation and Michaelis-Menten kinetics Biochemical reactions are often based on the action of proteins known as enzymes that catalyze reactions in living cells. Fig. 1.7 depicts an enzyme E binding to its substrate S to form a complex C. The complex breaks apart into a product , P, and the original enzyme that can act once more. Substrate is usually plentiful relative to the enzyme. In the context of this example, xrepresents the concentration of substrate in the reaction mixture. The speed of the reaction, v, (namely the rate at which product is formed) depends on x. When you actually graph the speed of the reaction as a function of the concentration, you see that it is not lin- ear: Figure 1.8 is typical.

This behaviour is called Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Note that the graph at rst rises almost like a straight line, but then it curves and approaches a horizontal asymptote. This graph tells us that the speed of the enzyme cannot exceed some xed level, i.e. it cannot be faster than K.Equation (1.8) is a rational function. Since xis a concentration, it must be a positive quantity, so we restrict attention to x\u00150. The expression in Eqn. (1.8) is a special case of the rational functions explored in Example 1.10, where n=1,A=K,a=kn. In Figure 1.8, we used plot this function for specic values of K,kn. The following observations can be made 1.The graph of Eqn. (1.8) goes through the origin. Indeed, when x=0we have v=0. 2.Close to the origin, the initial rise of the graph \"looks like\" a straight line. We can see this by considering values of xthat are much smaller than kn. Then the denominator (kn+x)is well approximated by the constant kn.

The predation rate P(x) is the number of prey eaten by a predator per unit time. Note that the predation rate depends on the prey density x.Interactions of predators and prey are often studied in ecology. Professor C.S. (\"Buzz\") Holling, (a former Director of the Institute of Animal Resource Ecology at the University of British Columbia) described three types of predators, termed \"Type I\", \"Type II\" and \"Type III\", according to their ability to consume prey as the prey density increases. The three Holling \"predator functional responses\" are shown in Fig. 1.10.

Then the number of aphids eaten by a ladybug per unit time in that unit area will be called the predation rate and denoted P(x). The predation rate usually depends on the prey density, and we approximate that dependence by P(x) =Kxn an+xn,where K ,a>0. (1.10) Here we consider the case that n=2. The aphids reproduce at a rate pro- portional to their number, so that the growth rate of the aphid population G (number of new aphids per hour) is G(x) =rx where r >0. (1.11) (a)For what aphid population density xdoes the predation rate exactly balance the aphid population growth rate? (b)Are there situations where the predation rate cannot match the growth rate? Explain your results in terms of the constants K ,a,r. Hints and partial solution (a)The wording \"the predation rate exactly balances the reproduction rate\" means that the two functions P(x)andG(x)are exactly equal. Hence, to/_481Use the sliders to manipulate the predation constants K,aand the aphid growth rate parameter r. How many solutions are there to P(x) =G(x)? Show that for some parameter values, there is only a trivial solution at x=0. Make a connection between this observation and part (b) of Example 1.3.solve this problem, equate P(x) =G(x)and determine the value of x(i.e., the number of aphids) at which this equality holds. You will nd that one solution to this equation is x=0. But if x6=0, you can cancel one factor of xfrom both sides and rearrange the equation to obtain a quadratic equation whose solution can be written down (in terms of the positive constants K,r,a). Hint: Recall that a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0 has roots x=\u0000b\u0006p b2\u00004ac 2a. These roots are real provided b2\u00004ac\u00150.(b)The solution you nd in (a) is only a real number (i.e. a real solution exists) if the discriminant (quantity inside the square-root) is positive. Determine when this situation can occur and interpret your answer in terms of the aphid and ladybugs. The solution to this problem is based on solving a quadratic equation, and so, relies on the fact that we chose the value n=2in the predation rate. What happens if n>2? How do we solve the same kind of problem if n=3,4etc? We return to this issue, and develop an approximate technique (Newton's method) in a later chapter.POWER FUNCTI ONS A S BUI LDIN G BLO CKS 41 1.7 Summary 1.Functions of the form f(x) =K\u0001xn(na positive integer) are called power functions with coefcient K. 2.Power functions with larger powers of nform graphs that are flatter near the origin and steeper for x>1. 3.An even function satises f(\u0000x) =f(x); an odd function satises f(\u0000x) = \u0000f(x). Identifying even and odd functions can aid in graph sketching. 4.The zeros of a function f(x)are roots of the equation f(x) =0. Identifying the root(s) of a function helps in sketching its graph. 5.Polynomials are sums of power functions. Rational functions are ratios of polynomials. By examining the behaviour of terms that dominate near and far from the origin, we can obtain a rough sketch of such functions. 6. Mathematical models can be used to describe scientic phenomenon. Mak- ing reasonable assumptions and observations are necessary for building a successful model. Translating these assumptions and observations into mathematics is the key. 7.Hill functions can be transformed into a linear relationship using a change of variables; the plots that result are called Lineweaver-Burk plots. 8. The mathematical models explored in this chapter concerned: (a) cell size, based on nutrient balance; (b) energy balance on Earth; (c) biochemical reactions and Michaelis-Menten kinetics; and (d) enzyme-catalyzed reactions and Hill functions. 9.Units, while often suppressed in math texts, can be immensely useful in solving application problems.

Determine the values of xat which the the functions are the same - i.e. they intersect. Are there two places of intersection or three? How does this depend on the integer m\u0000n? Note: The point (0,0)is always an intersection point. Thus, we are asking: when is there only onemore and when there are twomore intersection points? See Exercise 5 for an example of both types. 1.8.

Properties of animals are often related to their physical size or mass. For example, the metabolic rate of the animal ( R), and its pulse rate ( P) may be related to its body mass m by the approximate formulae R=AmbandP=Cmd, where A,C,b,d are positive constants. Such relationships are known as allometric relationships. (a)Use these formulae to derive a relationship between the metabolic rate and the pulse rate ( hint: eliminate m).

Eliminate r to nd the corresponding relationship between volume and surface area for a sphere. 1.23. Rate of a very simple chemical reaction. We consider a chemical re- action that does not saturate, and a simple linear relationship between reaction speed and reactant concentration.

A Hill func- tion is a nonlinear function - but if we redene variables, we can transform it into a linear relationship. The process is analogous to transforming Michaelis-Menten kinetics into a Lineweaver-Burk plot, as discussed in Appendix G.1.

Spacing in a school of sh According to the biologist Breder [Breder, 1951], two sh in a school prefer to stay some specic distance apart. Breder suggested that the sh that are a distance xapart are attracted to one another by a force FA(x) =A/xaand repelled by a second force FR(x) =R/xr, to keep from getting too close. He found the preferred spacing distance (also called the individual distance ) by determining the value of xat which the repulsion and the attraction exactly balance. Find the individual distance in terms of the quantities A,R,a,r(all assumed to be positive constants.)2 Average rates of change, average velocity and the secant line A physicist might study the motion of a falling ball by taking strobe images at xed time intervals, and gluing them side by side to get a record of position of the ball over time. In a similar manner, cell biologists study the motion of proteins inside living cells. First, the proteins are labeled by fluorescent \"tags\" (this makes them visible in microscopic images). Then images of some thin strip of the cell are made at xed time intervals, in regions through which the \"glowing\" (fluorescent) proteins move. Finally, those thin strips are \"glued\" together to form a record of the protein position over time, as shown in each panel of Fig 2.1. Biologists refer to such images as kymographs . Figure 2.1: Cell biologists track the motion of proteins inside cells on images like this kymograph. Data courtesy of Anna Akhmanova's lab shows the position of proteins that track growing ends of long biopolymers called microtubules as they get longer or shrink inside cells. Displacement is shown horizontally (scale bar 5 mm) and time vertically (scale bar 20 sec).The \"streaks of light\" in such kymographs allow us to determine the locations of the labeled proteins over time. as well as their velocity in the cell. But how fast were these proteins moving? Why are there zigzags in the left panel? And what happened in the treated cells (right panel) that made the streaks look different from those in the Katrukha, Natalie D Ter Ho- eve, Louis Hodgson, Marileen Dogterom, Patrick WB Derksen, and Anna Akhmanova. Mesenchymal cell invasion requires coop- erative regulation of persistent growth by slain2 and clasp1. Developmental cell, 39(6):708-723, 2016In this chapter we develop the tools to address some of these questions, and to characterize what we mean by velocity. As a rst step, we introduce average rate of change. To motivate the idea, we examine data for common processes: changes in temperature, and motion of a falling object. Simple experiments are described in each case, and some features of the data are discussed. Based on each example, we calculate net change over some time interval and then dene the average rate of change and average velocity. This concept generalizes to functions of any variable (not only time). We interpret this idea geometrically, in terms of the slope of a secant line . In both cases, we ask how to use average rate of change (over a given interval) to nd better and better approximations of the rate of change at a single instant, (i.e. at a point). We nd that one way to arrive at this abstract concept entails rening the dataset - collecting data at closer and closer time points. A second - more abstract - way is to use a limit. Eventually, this procedure allows us to arrive at the denition of the derivative , which is the instantaneous rate of change .52 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES 2.1 Time-dependent data and rates of change Section 2.1 Learning goals 1.Use (your favorite) graphical software package (spreadsheet, graphics calculator, online tools, etc.) to plot data points such as those in Table 2.1. 2.Describe the trends seen in such data using words such as 'increasing', 'decreasing', 'linear', 'nonlinear', 'shallow', 'steep', 'changes', etc. In this section we consider time dependent processes and develop the idea of rates of change.

This section could also be titled \"Shrinking the time-steps between measurements.\" So far, the average rates of change were computed over nite intervals. Our ultimate goal is to rene this idea and dene a rate of change at each point, i.e. an instantaneous rate of change . But to do so, we rst consider how a data set can be rened by making more frequent measurements to improve the notion of a rate of change close to a given point . We discuss two examples below. Rened temperature data We can rene the original data of temperature T(t)for cooling milk from Figure 2.2 by taking more closely spaced time points. Table 2.4 provides a sample of the rened data. The leftmost plot in Figure 2.9 shows the original data set with measure- ments every Dt=2min. The second and third plots have successively more rened measurements with shorter intervals between time points ( Dt=1min andDt=0.5min). After 10 minutes, fewer points were collected in each case.

If you wanted 50 equally spaced data points over a 2 s interval, what would Dtbe?By collecting data at ner time points, we can determine the \"velocity\" of the object with greater accuracy. Indeed, taking smaller and smaller time steps leads us to dene instantaneous velocity . /facetime_videoA brief summary of average and instantaneous velocity in the example of a falling ball.Instantaneous velocity We know that the velocity over an interval can be calculated by nding the slope of a secant line connecting the endpoints of that interval. The slopes of the secant lines in Figure 2.10(b) are steeper at the end of the time interval than at the beginning - lending justication to what we intuitively know: a falling object's velocity increases as time passes. With this in mind, to dene an instantaneous velocity at some time t0, we compute average velocities over decreasing time intervals t0\u0014t\u0014t0+h, allowing hto get smaller. Note: we use the notation h!0 to denote the shrinking the time interval. For example, we make the strobe flash faster so that Dt= (t0+h)\u0000t0= h!0. At each stage, we calculate an average velocity, \u00afvfor the interval t0\u0014t\u0014t0+h. As we continue to rene the measurements in this way, we arrive at a value for the velocity that we denote the instantaneous velocity . This number represents \"the velocity of the ball at the very instant t=t0\". Denition 2.6 (Instantaneous velocity) The instantaneous velocity at v (t0)is dened as v(t0) =lim h!0\u00afv the average velocity over the interval t0\u0014t\u0014t0+h. In other words, v(t0) =lim h!0y(t0+h)\u0000y(t0) h.AVER AGE R ATES OF CHA NGE ,AVER AGE V ELOCITY AND THE SECAN T LIN E 61 We shall be more explicit about the meaning of the notation lim h!0in the next chapter. Example 2.8 (Computing an instantaneous velocity) Use Gallileo's formula for the distance fallen, Eqn. (2.1) ,y(t) =ct2, to compute the instanta- neous velocity of a falling object at time t 0. Solution. We have already found the average velocity of the falling object over a time interval t0\u0014t\u0014t0+hin Example 2.6, obtaining Eqn. (2.3), v(t0) =lim h!0\u00afv=lim h!0c(2t0+h) =2ct0. Here we the fact that the expression c(2t0+h)approaches 2ct0as hshrinks to zero. This result holds for any time t0. More generally, we could write that at time t, the instantaneous velocity is v(t) =2ct. For example, for c=4.9m/s2, the velocity of an object at time t=1s after it is released is v(1) =9.8 m/s. \u0006 2.5 Introduction to the derivative Section 2.5 Learning goals 1. Explain the rst examples of calculation of the derivative. 2.

We are ready for the the denition of the derivative. /_481Ash!0, the secant line approaches atangent line . Use the slider for hto show this trend, and note that the slope of the secant line (average velocity) approaches the slope of the tangent line (instantaneous velocity) at the point x0.Denition 2.7 (The derivative) The derivative of a function y=f(x)at a point x0is the same as the instantaneous rate of change of fatx0. It is denoteddy dx x0or f0(x0)and dened as dy dx x0=f0(x0) =lim h!0[f(x0+h)\u0000f(x0)] h. We can use this to update our denition of instantaneous velocity: Denition 2.8 (Velocity) Ify=f(t)is the position of an object at time tthen the derivative f0(t)at time t0is the instantaneous velocity, also simply called thevelocity of the object at that time.62 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Example 2.9 (Formal calculation of velocity) Use Gallileo's formula to set up and calculate the derivative of Eqn. (2.1) , and show that it corresponds to the instantaneous velocity obtained in Example 2.8. Solution. We set up the calculation using limit notation, recalling Gallileo's formula states y(t) =ct2. We compute v(t0) = lim h!0y(t0+h)\u0000y(t0) h = lim h!0c(t0+h)2\u0000c(t0)2 h = h\u0013 =lim h!0c(2t0+h) =2ct0. (2.4) All steps but the last are similar to the calculation (and algebraic simplica- tion) of average velocity (compare with Example 2.6). In the last step, we formally allow the time increment hto shrink, which is equivalent to taking limh!0. \u0006 Example 2.10 (Calculating the derivative of a function) Compute the derivative of the function f (x) =Cx2at some point x =x0. Solution. In the previous example, we calculated the derivative of the func- tiony=f(t) =ct2with respect to t. Here we merely have a similar (quadratic) function of x. Thus, we have already solved this problem. By switching no- tation ( t0!x0andc!C) we can write down the answer, 2Cx0at once. However, as practice, we rewrite the steps in the case of the general point x Fory=f(x) =Cx2we have dy dx= lim h!0f(x+h)\u0000f(x) h = lim h!0C(x+h)2\u0000Cx2 h = lim h!0C(x2+2xh+h2)\u0000x2 h = lim h!0C(2xh+h2) h=lim h!0C(2x+h) =2Cx. Evaluating this result for x=x0we obtain the answer 2 Cx0.\u0006 We recognize from this denition that the derivative is obtained by starting with the slope of a secant line (average rate of change of fover the interval x0\u0014x\u0014x0+h) and proceeds to shrink the interval ( limh!0) so that it approaches a single point ( x0). In later chapters, the resultant line is called the tangent line and the value obtained identied as the instantaneous rate ofAVER AGE R ATES OF CHA NGE ,AVER AGE V ELOCITY AND THE SECAN T LIN E 63 change of the function with respect to the variable xat the point of interest, x0. We explore properties and meanings of this concept in the next chapter. Note: we have used different notations to denote the derivative of f(x) =y. Further others exist. Each of the following may be used interchangeably: f0(x),d f dx,d dxf(x),dy dx,y0,D f(x), and Dy. These notations evolved for historical reasons and are used interchangeabley in science. 2.6 Summary 1.Graphs of time-dependent data are helpful to visualize trends such as increasing and decreasing values, steepness, linearity, and so on. 2.An average rate of change is the ratio of change in a dependent variable ( y) over a range of the independent variable ( x), often denoted Dy/Dx. 3.A secant line is a straight line through any two points on the graph of a function.

Use the denition of derivative to calcu- late the derivative of the function f(x) =1 x+1. Note: intermediate steps are required.3 Three faces of the derivative: geometric, analytic, and computational In Chapter 2 we bridged two concepts: the average rate of change (slope of secant line) and the instantaneous rate of change (the derivative). We arrived at a technique for calculating a derivative algebraically. As a result, we introduced limits - a concept that merits further discussion. One goal of this chapter is to consider the technical aspects of limits - a requirement if we are to use the denition of the derivative to determine derivatives of common functions. But rst, we consider a distinct approach which is geometric in flavour. Namely, we show that the local behaviour of a continuous function is de- scribed by a tangent line at a point on its graph: we can visualize the tangent line by zooming into the graph of the function. This duality - the geometric (graphical) and analytic (algebraic calculation) views - form themes through- out the discussions to follow. They are two complementary, but closely related approaches to calculus. 3.1 The geometric view: zooming into the graph of a function Section 3.1 Learning goals 1.Describe the link between the local behaviour of a function (seen by zooming into the graph) at a point and the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. 2. Sketch a function's derivative given its graph. Locally, the graph of a function looks like a straight line In this section we consider well-behaved functions whose graphs are \"smooth\", as opposed to the discrete data points of Chapter 2. We link the derivative to the local shape of the graph of the function. By local behaviour70 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES we mean the shape we see when we zoom into a point on the graph. Imagine using a microscope where the center of the eld of vision is some point of interest. As we zoom in, the graph looks flatter, until we observe a straight line, as shown in Figure 3.1. Mastered Material Check 1. Write down the equation of a generic straight line. 2. Identify the slope of that straight line. 3. How many zeros does the function f(x) =x3\u0000xhave?Denition 3.1 (Tangent line) The straight line that we see when we zoom into the graph of a smooth function at some point x0is called the tangent lineat x 0.

The slope of that tangent line is the derivative of the function at x=1.5.Example 3.1 (Zooming into a polynomial) Consider the function shown in Figure 3.1, y=f(x) =x3\u0000x, and the point x=1.5. Find the tangent line to the graph of this function by zooming in at the given point. Solution. The graph of the function is shown in each panel of Figure 3.1, where we have indicated the point of interest with a red dot. Now zooming in on the given point. Locally, the graph resembles a straight line. This is the tangent line to f(x)atx=1.5. \u0006 /_481Zooming in to the graph of a function.

(2) Now change the function to f(x) =jxjand note that when zooming into the cusp at x=0, we do not see a (single) tangent line. In that case we say that the derivative does not exist at the given point.Example 3.2 (Zooming into the sine graph at the origin) Determine the derivative of the function y=sin(x)atx=0by zooming into the origin on its graph. Write down the equation of the tangent line at that point. Solution. In Figure 3.2 we zoom into x=0 on the graph of the function y=sin(x). The sequence of zooms leads to a straight line (far right panel) that we identify once more as the tangent line to the function at x=0. From the graph, the slope of this tangent line is 1. We say that the derivative of the function y=f(x) =sin(x)atx=0is 1, and write f0(0) =1to denote this. As this line goes through (0,0)and has slope 1, its equation is y=x. We can also say that close to x=0 the graph of y=sin(x)looks a lot like the line y=x.\u0006 Mastered Material Check 4. Using the far right panel of Figure 3.2, perform the calculations that verify the y=sin(x)looks a lot likey=xnear x=0. 5.

Eventually, the graph resembles a line of slope 1. This is the tangent line at x=0and its slope, the derivative of y=sin(x)atx=0 is 1.At a cusp or a discontinuity, the derivative is not dened If we zoom into a function at a cusp or a discontinuity, there is no single straight line that describes the local behaviour. For example, in Figure 3.3, we see two distinct lines meeting at a sharp \"corner\". xy xy xy Figure 3.3: A function has no tangent line at a a cusp and the derivative is not dened at that point. Zooming into a discontinuity presents another problem: there is no line at all, as in Figure 3.4. Finally, a function like 1/xhas a singularity at x=0 which shows up as a vertical line whose slope is innite. In all such cases, we say that the function has no tangent line its derivative is not dened at the into a function at a discontinuity shows no single distinct line that might be a tangent line.72 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES From a function to a sketch of its derivative The tangent line to the graph of a function varies from point to point along the graph of the function - what we see when zooming in depends on theMastered Material Check 6.

This means that the derivative f0(x)is, itself, also a function . Here we consider the connection between these two functions by using the graph of one to sketch the graph of other. The hand-sketch is approximate, but preserves important elements. Example 3.3 Consider the function in Figure 3.5. Reason about the tangent lines at various points along to sketch the derivative f0(x). xf(x) Figure 3.5: The graph of a function. We sketch its derivative.Solution.

Next, in Figure 3.7, we these rough values for slopes. Only a few points have been plotted for f0(x), but these trends are clear: the derivative function has twozeros , and it dips below the axis between these places.

Molecular motors Microtubules (MT) are long, rod-like cellular structures (introduced in Chapter 2) with both structural and transportation roles in living cells. Human nerve cells can be up to 1 meter in length, which makes for a challenge to move material from the cell body - where it is made - to the cell ends where it is needed for repair or metabolism. Microtubules act like highways for \"molecular motors\", proteins that \"drive\" along these routes, transporting the necessary cargo. k kinesinvesicle + k+microtubules Figure 3.10: The molecular motor kinesin walks towards a microtubule \"plus\" end. It can detach and reattach to another microtubule.Microtubules have distinct ends (called \"plus\" and \"minus\" ends). Some motors specialize in moving towards the + end, while others move towards the - end. Figure 3.10 is a schematic diagram of kinesin (represented by the letter k), a plus-end directed motor. As shown in the gure, kinesin can hop off one MT and onto another MT pointing in the opposite direction. In Example 3.7, we study a sample vesicle track (displacement, yover time t) and decipher the sequence of motor events that caused that motion.

Over each of these line segments, the slope dy/dt(which corresponds to the instantaneous velocity, v(t)) is constant. Segments with positive slope correspond to motion towards the right (as in the top microtubule track in Figure 3.10. Over times where the slope is negative, the motion is to the left. Where the slope is zero (flat graph), the vesicle was stationary. In Figure 3.11(b), we sketch the graph of the instantaneous velocity, v(t). Observe that v(t), which is the derivative of y(t), is not dened at the points where y(t)has \"corners\". (b)Based on Figure 3.11(b), the kinesin motor was moving on a right-facing microtubule, then hopped onto a left-facing microtubule, and then hopped back to a right -facing microtubule. For a brief time it was either stuck or detached from the microtubule tracks (stationary part). Finally, it hopped onto a left-moving microtubule. \u0006THREE FACES OF TH E DERI VATI VE :GEO METRI C ,ANALYTIC ,AND COM PUTATIO NAL 75 3.2 The analytic view: calculating the derivative Section 3.2 Learning goals 1.

Evaluate simple limits of rational functions. 4.Calculate the derivative of a simple function using the denition of the derivative, 2.7. Technical matters: continuous functions and limits In Chapter 2, we saw functions made up of discrete data points. In Chapter 1 we studied several continuous functions: power, polynomial or rational. Intuitively, on the graph of a continuous function, every point is connected to neighbouring points. For example, the power function Eqn. (2.1) ,y(t) =ct2is continuous for all values of t, whereas a function such as y=pxis continuous and dened as a real number only for x\u00150. The function y=1/(x+1)is dened and continuous for x6=\u00001 (since division by zero is undened). Mastered Material Check 10. Use your favorite graphing software to verify these statements about the continuity of y=px andy=1/(x+1).We now make the intuitive discussion more precise with a formal de- nition, based on the concept of a limit. We rst dene what it means for a function to be continuous, and then show how limits are computed to test that denition. Denition 3.3 (Continuous function) We say that y=f(x)is continuous at a point x =a in its domain if lim x!af(x) =f(a). By this we mean that the function is dened at x=a, that the above limit exists, and that it matches with the value that the function takes at the given point. This denition has two important parts. First, the function should be dened at the point of interest, and second, the value assigned by the function has to \"t the local behaviour\" in the sense of the limit. This rules out a \"jump\" or \"break\" in the graph. When the above is not true at some point xs, we say that the function is discontinuous atxs. We give a few examples to demonstrate some different types of discontinuities that exist. At the same time we illustrate how limits are calculated. Function with a hole in its graph. Consider a function of the form f(x) =(x\u0000a)2 (x\u0000a).76 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Then if x6=a, we can cancel a common factor, and obtain (x\u0000a).

Sketch the graph of the function f(x) =(x\u00001)2 (x\u00001).offasxapproaches a. We write say that \"the limit as xapproaches a\"exists and is equal to 0. We also say that the function has a removable discontinuity . If we add the point (a,0)to the set of points at which the function is dened then we obtain a continuous function identical to the function x\u0000a. See also Appendix D. Function with jump discontinuity. Consider the function f(x) =( \u00001x\u0014a, 1 x>a. We say that the function has a jump discontinuity atx=a. As we approach the point of discontinuity we observe that the function has two distinct values, depending on the direction of approach. We formally capture this observation using right and left hand limits, lim x!a\u0000f(x) =\u00001, lim x!a+f(x) =1. Notice we use the left, and limx!a+ to denote approaching afrom the right. Since the left and right limits are unequal, we say that \"the limit does not exist \" (abbreviated DNE). Function with blow up discontinuity. Consider the function f(x) =1 x\u0000a. Then as xapproaches a, the denominator approaches 0, and the value of the function goes to\u0006\u00a5. We say that the function \" blows up \" atx=aand that the limit, lim x!af(x), does not exist.Mastered Material Check 12. What type of discontinuity does x2+4x+4 x+2have? 13.

Examples of limits. We now examine several examples of computations of limits. More details about properties of limits are provided in Appendix D. By Denition 3.3, to calculate the limit of any function at a point of continuity, we simply evaluate the function at the given point.THREE FACES OF TH E DERI VATI VE :GEO METRI a continuous function, a function with a removable discontinuity, a jump discontinuity, and a function with blow up discontinuity.Example 3.8 (Simple limit of a continuous function) Find the following limits: (a)lim x!3x2+2(b)lim x!11 x+1(c)lim x!10x 1+x. Solution. In each case, the function is continuous at the point of interest (at x=3,1,10 , respectively). Thus, we simply \"plug in\" the values of xin each case to obtain (a) lim x!3x2+2=32+2=11 (b) lim x!11 x+1=1 2(c) lim x!10x 1+x=10 11. \u0006 Example 3.9 (Hole in graph limits) Calculate the limits of the following functions. Note that each has a removable discontinuity (\"a x+1. Mastered Material Check 14. How do these examples change if the limit approaches a different value of x?Solution. We rst simplify algebraically by factoring the numerator, and then evaluate the limit. Note that the simplication is possible so long as we evalu- ate the limit, rather than the actual function , at the point of discontinuity. (a) sin(x))Use the observation made in Exam- ple 3.2 to arrive at the value of lim x!0sin(x) x. Solution. Example 3.2 illustrated the fact that close to x=0the function sin(x)has the following behaviour: sin(x)\u0019x, orsin(x) x\u00191.78 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES This is equivalent to the result lim x!0sin(x) x=1. (3.1) We read this \"as xapproaches zero, the limit of sin(x)/xis 1.\" This limit is used in later calculations involving derivatives of trigonometric functions. \u0006 Computing the derivative As discussed in Section 2.5, calculating a derivative requires the use of limits. To summarize: 1.For the secant line connecting the points xandx+hon the graph of a function, in the limit h!0, those points get closer together, leading to a tangent line. 2.The slope of a secant line is an average rate of change, but in the limit (h!0), we obtain the derivative, which is the slope of the tangent line. We illustrate how to use the denition of the derivative to compute a few derivatives. Example 3.11 (Derivative of a linear function) Using Denition 2.7 of the derivative, compute the derivative of the function y =f(x) =Bx+C. Solution.

(Indeed, as we establish shortly, the derivative of the sum of two functions is the same as the sum of their derivatives.) \u0006 Example 3.12 (Derivative of the cubic power function) Compute the derivative of the function y =f(x) =Kx3.THREE FACES OF TH E DERI VATI VE :GEO METRI C ,ANALYTIC ,AND COM PUTATIO NAL 79 /facetime_videoSee the steps in a related calculation of the derivative of y=f(x) =Kxn.

Solution. We write down the formula for this calculation at any point x and then simplify algebraically, using common denominators to combine fractions, and then, in the nal step, calculate the limit formally. Lastly we substitute the value Thus, the derivative of f(x) =1/xisf0(x) =\u00001/x2and at the point x=1it takes the value f0(1) =\u00001. \u0006 In Exercise 3. 8 we apply similar techniques to the derivative of the square- root function to show that y=f(x) =px) f0(x) =1 2px.

Describe how to nd the derivative of a function f(x)atx=x1 geometrically. we show a third aspect of the derivative: its numerical implementation using a simple spreadsheet. The ideas introduced here reappear in a variety of problems where repetitive calculations are needed to arrive at a solution. Denition 3.4 (Numerical derivative) A numerical derivative is an approx- imation to the value of the derivative, obtained by using a nite value of Dx, f0(x)numerical\u0019Df Dxrather than the actual value f0(x)actual=lim Dx!0Df Dx. The numerical derivative would be a good approximation of the true derivative provided that Dxis \"small enough\", that is, a step size for which the function f(x)does not changes dramatically. Since Dfis the difference of two values of f, (Df=f(x+Dx)\u0000f(x)) it follows that the numerical derivative is the same as the slope of a secant line . This important realization, associated with the second learning goal in this section, means that a secant line is often used to approximate a tangent line, and the slope of a secant line is used to approximate a derivative in numerical computations . We see this idea again in several contexts. Derivative of Michaelis-Menten and Hill functions Hint: Why would we ever use a spreadsheet, when there is other software for graphing? Basically, spreadsheets are powerful tools for computation, for manipulating data and for eliminating repetitive calculations. We gradually pick up some important skills in this course.A spreadsheet can be used to numerically approximate derivatives.

(A) Open your favorite spreadsheet and label columns where data will be kept.

The last column contains the approximation for the derivative Df/Dc. /_462Link to Google Sheets. This spreadsheet shows how to create an approximation for the derivative of the Hill function in (3.7). Fig 3.13 was produced by a similar set of calculations, see Feature Problem 3.1.

Here we used c=0as the left endpoint (input 0 into cell B2). Then let the spreadsheet create the entire set of cvalues by inputting =B2+$A$2in cell B3, and dragging the \"ll handle\" (small square dot on bottom right hand corner) down the column.

Similarly drag the ll handle to generate the rest of the points f2(c)corresponding to the all cvalues. (B) Next, we compute the desired numerical approximations of the derivatives.

Note: importantly, the two expressions are not equal . However, for sufciently small Dc, they approximate one another well. (2)Dragging the ll handle down the column generates the desired list of values of the numerical derivative. (C) Create a chart and plot the results. The xaxis is the set of values of c. Results of the above process (but modied for the two functions and their two derivatives) lead to the graphs shown on the right panel of Figure 3.13. \u0006 Example 3.14 Interpret the graphs of the derivatives in Figure 3.13b in terms of the way that reaction speed increases as the chemical concentration is increased in each of Michaelis-Menten and Hill function kinetics Mastered Material Check 18. Given time dependent data, can an exact derivative ever be determined?Solution. Both derivatives are positive everywhere, since both f1(c)and f2(c)are increasing functions. For Michaelis-Menten, the derivative is always decreasing. This agrees with the observation that f1(c)(thin yellow curve) gradually levels off and flattens as cincreases. While the reaction rate vMMincreases with c, the rate of increase, dv/dc, slows due to saturation at higher cvalues. In contrast, the Hill function derivative starts at zero , increases sharply, and only then decreases to zero. Correspondingly, the Hill function (thin red curve) is flat at rst, then becomes steeply increasing, and nally flattens to an asymptote. We can summarize this biochemically by saying that the initial reaction rate vHillis small and hardly changes near c\u00180. For intermediate range of c, the reaction rate depends sensitively on c(evidenced by large dv/dc). As cincreases to higher values, saturation slows down the rate of reaction, leading to the drop in dv/dc. \u0006 3.4 Summary 1.If we \"zoom in\" enough on a point x0on a graph of a function (with \"smooth\" behaviour), we see a straight line. This straight line is the tan- gent line at that point. The slope of this line is the derivative (instanta- neous rate of change) at that point, x0. 2.Given the graph of a function f(x), the derivative f0(x)can be sketched by approximating the slopes of the tangent lines of f(x), and plotting those slopes as points.THREE FACES OF TH E DERI VATI VE :GEO METRI C ,ANALYTIC ,AND COM PUTATIO NAL 83 3.A function is continuous at x=ain its domain if limx!af(x) = f(a).

Here we numerically compute the rst and second derivative of y=sin(t)and show the relationships between the trigonometric functions and their derivatives. We use only numerical methods (e.g. a spreadsheet), but in Chapter 14, we also study the analytical calculation of the same derivatives.

(c)Now calculate y00 1(t), that is (an approximation to) the derivative of the derivative of the sine function and add this to your graph.4 Differentiation rules, simple antiderivatives and applica- tions In Chapter 2 we dened the derivative of a function, y=f(x)by dy dx=f0(x) =lim h!0f(x+h)\u0000f(x) h. Using this formula, we calculated derivatives of a few power functions. Here, we gather results so far, and observe a pattern, the power rule . This rule allows us to compute higher derivatives (e.g. second derivative etc.), to differ- entiate polynomials, and even to nd antiderivatives by applying the rule \"in reverse\" (nding a function that has a given derivative). All these calculations are useful in common applications, including accelerated motion. These are investigated later in this chapter. We round out the technical material by stating several other rules of differentiation (product and quotient), allowing us to easily calculate derivatives of rational functions. 4.1 Rules of differentiation Learning goals for Section 4.1 1.Express the power rule (Table 4.1) and be prepared to apply it to both derivatives and antiderivatives of power functions and polynomials. 2.Explain what is meant by the statement that \"the derivative is a linear operation\". 3.Describe the concept of an antiderivative and why it is dened only up to some constant. 4.Express the product and quotient rules and be able to apply these to calculating derivatives of products and of rational functions.90 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES The derivative of power functions: the power rule We have already computed the derivatives of several of the power functions. See Example 3.5 for y=x0=1and Example 3.6 for y=x1. See also Example 2.10 for y=x2and Example 3.12 for y=x3. We gather these results in Table 4.1. From the table, we observe that the derivative of a power function is also a power function: the original power becomes a coefcient and the new power is reduced by 1. We refer to this pattern as the power rule of differentiation.Function Derivative f(x) f0(x) 1 4.1: The Power Rule of differentia- tion states that the derivative of the power function y=xnisnxn\u00001. For now, we have established this result for integer n. Later, we nd this result holds for other powers that are not integer.We can show that this rule applies for any power function of the form y=f(x) =xnwhere nis an integer power. The calculation is essentially the same as examples illustrated in a previous chapter, but the step of expanding the binomial (x+h)nentails lengthier algebra. (Such expansion contains terms of the form xn\u0000khkmultiplied by binomial coefcients , and we include the details in Appendix E.) From now on, we simply use this result for any power function with integer powers (rather than calculating the derivative using its denition). Example 4.1 Find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the power function y=f(x) =4x5atx=1, and determine the y-intercept of that tangent line. Solution. Using the power rule, the derivative of the function is f0(x) =20x4. At the point x=1, we have dy/dx=f0(1) =20andy=f(1) =4. This means that the tangent line goes through the point (1,4)and has slope 20. Thus, its equation is Mastered Material Check 1. Verify that the point (1,4)satises the equation y=20x\u000016.y\u00004 x\u00001=20) y=4+20(x\u00001) =20x\u000016. Letting x=0in the of the tangent line, we nd that the y-intercept of line is y=\u000016. \u0006 Example 4.2 (Energy loss and Earth's temperature) In Section 1.3, we studied the energy balance on Earth. According to Eqn. (1.5) , the rate of loss of energy from the surface of the Earth depends on its temperature according to the rule Eout(T) =4pr2esT4. Calculate the rate of change of this outgoing energy with respect to the temperature T . Solution. The quantities p,e,rare constants for this problem. Hence the rate of change ('derivative') of energy with respect to D APPLI CATIO NS 91 \u0006 Next, we nd that the result for derivatives of power functions can be ex- tended to derivatives of polynomials, using simple properties of the deriva- tive. The derivative is a linear operation The derivative satises several convenient properties, among them: 1.the derivative of a sum of two functions is the same as the sum of the derivatives; and 2. a constant multiplying a function can be brought outside the derivative. We summarize these rules: The derivative is a linear operation , that is: d dx(f(x) +g(x))=d f dxC =Cd f dx. (4.2)Mastered Material Check 2. Verify Eqns. (4.1) and (4.2) hold forf(x) =x3,g(x) =x2andC=4. 3. Give an example which shows squaring is nota linear operation.In general, a linear operation Lis a rule or process satises as functions, vectors, etc.) on which Lacts, and cis a constant multiplier. We refer to Eqns. (4.1) and(4.2) as the linearity properties of the derivative. The derivative of a polynomial Using the linearity of the derivative, we can extend our differentiation power rule to compute the derivative of any polynomial. Recall that polynomials are sums of power functions multiplied by constants. A polynomial of degree n has the form p(x) =anxn+an\u00001xn\u00001+:::a1x+a0, (4.3) where the coefcients, aiare constant and nis an integer. Hence, the deriva- tive of a polynomial is just the sum of derivatives of power functions (multi- plied by constants). Formally, the derivative of Eqn. (4.3) p0(x) =dy dx=an\u0001nxn\u00001+an\u00001\u0001(n\u00001)xn\u00002+\u0001\u0001\u0001+a1. (4.4)92 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES (Observe that each term consists of the coefcient times the derivative of a power function. The constant term a0has disappeared since the derivative of any constant is zero.) The derivative, p0(x), is a function in its own right, and a polynomial as well. Its degree, n\u00001, is one less than that of p(x). In view of this observation, we could ask: what is the derivative of the derivative? Notation: we henceforth refer to the \"derivative of the derivative\" as a second derivative , written in the notation p00(x)or, equivalentlyd2p dx2. Mastered Material Check 4. Are their other notations for the second derivative of p(x)that you might expect? 5. Check that Eqn. (4.7) is an antiderivative of Eqn. (4.6) by differentiating Eqn. (4.7).Using the same rules, we can compute, obtaining p00(x) =d2p dx2=ann(n\u00001)xn\u00002+an\u00001(n\u00001)(n\u00002)xn\u00003+\u0001\u0001\u0001+a2. (4.5) The following examples should be used for practice. Example 4.3 Find the rst and second derivatives of the function (a) y =f(x) =2x5+3x4+x3\u00005x2+x\u00002with respect to x and (b) y =f(t) =At3+Bt2+Ct+D with respect to t. Solution. We obtain the (a)f0(x) =10x4+12x3+3x2\u000010x+1 and f00(x) =40x3+36x2+6x\u000010. (b) f0(t) =3At2+2Bt+Candf00(t) =6At+2B. In (b) the independent variable is t, but, of course, the rules of differentiation are the same. \u0006 Antiderivatives of power functions and polynomials Given a derivative, we can ask \"what function was differentiated to lead to this result?\" This reverse process is termed antidifferentiation , and the function we seek is then called an antiderivative . Antidifferentiation reverses the operation of differentiation. We ask, for example, which function has as its derivative y0(t) =Atn? (4.6) The original function, y(t), should have a power higher by 1(of the form tn+1), but the \"guess\" yguess=Atn+1is not quite right, since differentiation results in A(n+1)tn. To x this, we revise the \"guess\" to y(t) =A1 (n+1)tn+1. (4.7) Question. Is this the only function that has the desired property? No, there are other functions whose derivatives are the same. For example, consider adding an arbitrary constant Cto the function in Eqn. (4.7) and note that weDI FFERENTI ATION RULES ,SIM PLE A NTIDER IVATI VES AN D APPLI CATIO NS 93 obtain the same derivative (since the derivative of the constant is zero). We summarize our ndings: The antiderivative of y0(t) =Atnis y(t) =A1 (n+1)tn+1+C. (4.8) We also note a similar result that holds for functions in general: Given a function, f(x)we can only determine its antiderivative up to some (additive) constant .Mastered Material Check 6. What is an example of a constant that is notadditive? 7. Verify the solution to Example 4.4 by differentiating. 8. In Example 4.5, identify all: (a) constants, (b) dependent variables, and (c) independent variables.We can extend the same ideas to nding the antiderivative of a polyno- mial. Example 4.4 (Antiderivative of a polynomial) Find an antiderivative of the polynomial y0(t) =At2+Bt+C. Solution. Since differentiation is a linear operation, we can construct the antiderivative by antidifferentiating each of the component power functions. Applying Eqn. (4.8) to the components we get, y(t) =A1 3t3+B1 2t2+Ct+D, where Dis an arbitrary constant. We see that the antiderivative of a polyno- mial is another polynomial whose degree is higher by 1 . \u0006 Example 4.5 Thesecond derivative of some function is y00(t) =c1t+c2.Find a function y (t)for which this is true Solution. The above polynomial has degree 1. Evidently, this function resulted by taking the derivative of y0(t), which had to be a polynomial of degree 2. We can check that either y0(t) =c1 2t2+c2t,ory0(t) =c1 2t2+c2t+ c3(for any constant c3) could work. In turn, the function y(t)had to be a polynomial of degree 3. One such function is y(t) =c1 6t3+c2 2t2+c3t+c4, where c4is any constant. In short, is: for differentiation y(t)!y0(t)!y00(t), whereas for antidifferentiation y00(t)!y0(t)!y(t). \u0006 These results are used in applications to acceleration, velocity, and dis- placement of a moving object in Section 4.2.94 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Product and quotient rules for derivatives So far, using the power rule, and linearity of the derivative (Section 4.1), we calculated derivatives of polynomials. Here we state without proof (see Appendix E), two other rules of differentiation.

Featured Problem 4.1 (Dynamics of actin in the cell) Actin is a structural protein that forms long laments and networks in living cells. The actin net- work is continually assembling from small components (actin monomers) and disassembling back again. To study this process, scientists attach fluorescent markers to actin, and watch the fluorescence intensity change over time. In one experiment, both red and green fluorescent labels were used. The green label fluoresces only after it is activated by a pulse of light, whereas the red fluorescent protein is continually active. It was noted that the red and green fluorescence intensities ( R,G) satised the following relationships: Such relationships between a function of time and its own derivative are examples of differential equations , a topic we revisit in Chapter 11.dR dt= (a\u0000b)R,dG dt=\u0000bG where a,bare constants that characterize the rate of assembly and disassem- bly (\"breakup\") of actin.

How sensitive is this year's population to slight changes in last year's population? Compute the derivative dy /dx to answer this question. A preview of the chain rule We give a brief preview of the chain rule , an important rule discussed in detail in Chapter 8. This rule extends the rules of differentiation to composite functions , that is, functions made up of applying a sequence of operations one after the other. For example, the two functions f(u) =u10,u=g(x) =3x2+1, (4.9) could be applied one after the other to lead to the new composite function f(g(x)) =\u0000 3x2+1\u000110. The chain rule states that the derivative of this new function with respect to x is the product of derivatives of the individual functions.96 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES The chain rule Ify=f(z)andz=g(x)are two functions, then the derivative of the composite function f(g(x))is dy dx=d f dzdz dx. Example 4.8 Use the chain rule to differentiate the composite function y=f(g(x)) =\u0000 3x2+1\u000110. Solution. The functions being composed are the same as in Eqn. (4.9) . Applying the chain rule gives: dy dx=d f dudu dx=10u9\u00016x=60(3x2+1)9x. \u0006 The details of how to use the chain rule, and many applications are post- poned to Chapter 8. The power rule for fractional powers Using the denition of the derivative, we have already shown that the deriva- tive ofpxisy0(x) =1 2px(see Exercise 2.8). We restate this result using fractional power notation. Recall thatpx=x1/2. The derivative of y=pxisy0(x) =1 2x\u00001/2. This idea can be generalized to any fractional power. Indeed, we state here a result (to be demonstrated in Chapter 9). Derivative of fractional-power function: The derivative of y=f(x) =xm/nisdy dx=m nx(m n\u00001). Notice that this appears in the last row of Table 4.1.

Note: in Chapter 9 we will show that implicit differentiation can be used to nd the desired derivative without rst solving for the variable of interest. \u0006 4.2 Application of the second derivative to acceleration Section 4.2 Learning goals 1.Recognize that velocity and acceleration are rst and second derivatives of position with respect to time (and that velocity and position are rst and second antiderivatives of acceleration.) 2.Given constant acceleration, be able to nd the velocity and displacement of the moving object. We have already dened the \"derivative of a derivative\" as the second derivative . Here we provide a natural example of a second derivative, the acceleration of an object: the rate of change of the velocity (which is, as we have seen, the rate of change of a displacement). We restate these relation- ships in terms of antiderivatives below. Position, velocity, and acceleration Consider an object falling under the force of gravity. Let y(t)denote the position of the object at time t. From now on, we refer to the instantaneous velocity at time tsimply as the velocity ,v(t). Denition 4.1 (The velocity) Given the position of some particle as a function of time, y(t), we dene the velocity as the rate of change of the position, i.e. the derivative of y (t): v(t) =dy dt=y0(t). Mastered Material Check 12. Give three different examples of possible units for velocity. 13. Give three different examples of possible units for acceleration.In general, vmay depend on time, which we indicated by writing v(t). Denition 4.2 (The acceleration) We dene the acceleration as the (instan- taneous) rate of change of the velocity, i.e. as the derivative of v (t). a(t) =dv dt=v0(t) (acceleration could also depend on time, hence a (t)).98 DI FFERENTI AL CA LCULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Since the acceleration is the derivative of the derivative of the original function, we also use the notation a(t) =d dt\u0012dy dt\u0013 =d2y dt2=y00(t). Note: we have used three equivalent ways of writing a second derivative. This notation evolved for historical reasons, and is used interchangeably in science. Acceleration is a second derivative of the position. Given a(t), the acceleration as a function of t, we can use antidifferenti- ation to obtain the velocity v(t). Similarly, we can use the velocity v(t)to determine the position y(t)(up to some constant). The constants must be obtained from other information, as the next examples illustrate. Example 4.10 (Uniformly accelerated motion of a falling object) Suppose that the acceleration of an object is constant in time, i.e. a(t) =\u0000g=constant. Use antidifferentiation to determine the velocity and the position of the object as functions of time. /facetime_videoVideo summary of how to compute the velocity and displacement given uniform acceleration.Note: here we have a coordinate system in which the positive direction is \"upwards\", and so the acceleration, which is in the opposite direction, is negative. On Earth, g=9.8 m /s2. Solution. First, what function of time v(t)has the property that a(t) =v0(t) =\u0000g=constant ? The function a(t) =\u0000gis a polynomial of degree 0in the variable t, so the velocity, which is its antiderivative, has to be a polynomial of degree 1, such asv(t) =\u0000gt. This is oneantiderivative of the acceleration. Other functions, such as v(t) =\u0000gt+c, (4.10) would work for any constant c. How would we pick a value for the constant c? We need additional infor- mation. Suppose we are told that v(0) =v0is the known initial velocity . Later we refer to the statement v(0) =v0as an \"initial condition,\" since it species how fast the object was moving initially at t=0. Then, substituting t=0into Eqn. (4.10), we in general, v(t) =\u0000gt+v0 where v0is the initial velocity of the object. Next, let us determine the position of the object as a function of t, that is,y(t). Recall that v(t) =y0(t). Thus, antidifferentiation leads VES AN D APPLI CATIO NS 99 where, as before we allow for some additive constant k. Reasoning as before, Mastered Material Check 14. Verify that the derivative ofy(t) =\u000012gt2+v0t+kis the given expression for v(t).we can determine the value of the constant kfrom a known initial position of the object y(0) =y0. As before (plugging t=0into Eqn. k=y0, so that y(t) =\u00001 2gt2+v0t+y0. (4.12) Here we assumed that the acceleration is due to gravity, \u0000g, but any other motion with constant acceleration would be treated in the same way. \u0006 Summary, uniformly accelerated motion: If an object moves with constant acceleration\u0000g, then given its initial velocity v0and initial position y0at time t=0, the position at any later time is given by: y(t) =\u00001 2gt2+v0t+y0. This powerful conclusion is a direct result of 1. the assumption that the acceleration is constant, 2. the elementary rules of calculus, and 3.the denitions of velocity and acceleration as rst and second derivatives of the position. We further explore the relationships between position, velocity and accelera- tion of a falling object in the examples below. ty tv ta Figure 4.1: The position, velocity, and acceleration of an object that is thrown upwards and falls under the force of gravity.Example 4.11 Determine when the object reaches its highest point, and its velocity at that time. Solution. When the object reaches its highest point, its velocity has de- creased to zero. From then on, the velocity becomes negative and the object falls back down.

If we are given additional information, for example that y(0) =0, we could then select one specic curve out of this family of solutions. A second point to observe is that antidifferentiation smoothes a function. Even though y0(x)has cusps in (b), we nd that y(x)is smooth.

The derivative of a polynomial is thus a sum of derivatives of power functions. 2. A \"second derivatives\" is the derivate of a derivative. 3.Antiderivatives reverse the process of differentiation. Antidifferentiation is, however, not unique. Given a function f(x), we can only determine its antiderivative up to some arbitrary constant. 4.

We have seen that the tangent line approximates the local behaviour of a function, at least close enough to the point of tangency. Here we use this idea in a formal procedure called linear approximation . The idea is to chose a point (often called the base point ) where the value of the function and its derivative are known, or are easy to calculate, and use the tangent line at that point to estimate values of the function in the vicinity.

We have not yet discussed nding derivatives of trigonometric functions, but recall from Example 3.2 that close to x=0the function y= sin(x)is well approximated by its approximation of y=sin(x)near x=0issin(x)\u0019x(provided xis in radians , to be discussed in Chapter 14). Thus, at x=0.1radians, we nd thatsin(0.1)\u00190.1, close to its true value of sin(0.1) =0.09983 (found using a calculator). \u0006 Accuracy of the linear approximation Example 5.8 (Over or underestimate?) For each of Examples 5.6 and 5.7, determine whether the linear approximation over or underestimates the true value of the function. Solution. In Figure 5.5(a,b), we show the functions and their linear approx- imations. In (a) we see that the tangent line to y=x2atx=10is always underneath the graph of the function, so a linear approximation underesti- mates the true value of the function. In (b), we see that the tangent line to y=sin(x)atx=0is above the graph for x>0and below the graph for x<0. This shows that the linear approximation is larger than (overestimates) the function for x>0and smaller than (underestimates) the function for x<0. \u0006 In Chapter 6, we associate these properties with the concavity of the function, that is, whether the graph is locally concave up or down.TA NGENT LI NES ,LIN EAR A PPROXI M ATION ,AND NEW TO N 'S M ETHOD 115 5 10 15 20100200300400 y=x2 tangent line xy x) tangent liney=x3x xy (a) (b) Figure 5.5: Functions (black curves) and their linear approximations (red) for Examples 5.6 and 5.7.

Describe the geometry on which Newton's method is based (Figure 5.7). 2.Given f(x)and initial guess x0, use Newton's method to nd improved values x1,x2, etc., for the zero of f(x)(value of xsuch that f(x) =0). 3.For a given function f(x), select a suitable initial guess x0for Newton's method from which to start the iteration. Denition 5.1 (Zero) Given a function f(x), we say that x\u0003is azero off if f(x\u0003) =0. We also say that \"x\u0003is aroot of the equation f (x) =0\". In many cases, it is impossible to compute a value of a zero, x\u0003analyt- ically. Based on tangent line approximations, we now explore Newton's method , an approximation that does the job. Newton's method Consider the function y=f(x)shown in Figure 5.7. We have already found that a tangent line approximates the behaviour of a function close to a pointTA NGENT LI NES ,LIN EAR A PPROXI M ATION ,AND NEW TO N 'S M ETHOD 117 of tangency. It can also be used to build up and rene an approximation of the zeros of the function. Our goal is to nd a decimal approximation for the value xsuch that f(x) =0.(In Fig. 5.7, this value is denoted by x\u0003.) Newton's method is an iterated scheme (a procedure that gets repeated). It is applied several times, to generate a decimal expansion of the desired zero to any level of accuracy. x1xx0f(x0)tangent line xy Figure 5.7: In Newton's method, we seek a decimal approximation for x\u0003, a zero of y=f(x). A rough initial guess, x0, is rened by \"sliding down the tangent line\" (glued to the curve at x0). This brings us to an improved guess x1. Repeating this again and again allows us to nd the root to any desired accuracy.A starting value, x0, initiates the method. This can be a rough rst guess for the zero we seek, found graphically, for example. Newton's method, applied a number of times, will generate better and better approximations of the true zero, x\u0003. Gluing a tangent line at x0, we follow it down to its x-axis intersection. In a previous section, we have already computed that intersection point in (5.3) , to be x1=x0\u0000f(x0) f0(x0). Then usually x1is closer to x\u0003, improving upon the initial guess. Now use x1as the (improved) guess, and repeat the process. This gener- values x2=x1\u0000f(x1) f0(x1). root x\u0003. The same 'recipe' is repeated. In practice, when it works, Newton's method converges quite rapidly, that is, it approaches the root with excellent accuracy, after very few repetitions ( the root of the equation f(x) = 0, we can improve the accuracy of that approximation with another iteration using xk+1=xk\u0000f(xk) f0(xk). /_481Newton's Method applied to the function f(x) =x3\u0000x\u00003.

Starting with an initial guess x0=1(not very close to the value of the root), we show in Figure 5.8 how Newton's method applies a tangent line to determination x1.

You can view the formulae by clicking on a cell in the sheet but you cannot edit the sheet here. A spreadsheet is ideal for carrying out the repetitive calculations, as shown in Table 5.2. For example, we compute the following set of values using our spreadsheet. Observe that the fourth column contains the computed (Newton's method) values, x1,x2,etc. These values are then copied onto the rst column to be used as new \"initial guesses\". After several repetitions, the numbers calculated converge to 2.4495 , and no longer change to that level of accuracy displayed. This signals that we have obtained the root to 5 signicant gures applied to Example 5.11. We start with x0=1as our initial approximation and rene it four times.Note: it is possible that Newton's method fails to nd a root - something we do not explore further here.

We did so by solving an equation of the form P(x) =G(x)forxthe aphid density predation of aphids by a ladybug. Our solution relied on the quadratic formula. Now consider the case that the predation rate is P(x) =Kx3 a3+x3, where K,a>0. (5.4) In this case, steps shown in Example 1.3 lead to a cubic equation for x, which is not easy to solve by pen and paper. This is a classic situation where Newton's method proves useful.

Convert the equation to a form for which Newton's method is suitable. Then use Newton's method to solve your problem. Assume that K=30aphids eaten per hour, a=20aphids, andr=0.5per hour. To get a reasonable initial guess, plot P(x)andG(x)on the same graph and determine roughly where they intersect. Solution.

There is another intersection at x0\u001960. To implement the method, we apply to the root x= 13.05407289 after four applied to Example 5.12. We start with x0=10as the initial approximation.120 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Since xmeasures a density of aphids (e.g. average number per cm2), it is reasonable to nd a real valued solution (rather than an integer \"number of aphids\"). /facetime_videoA short video discussion of the Aphid-ladybug problem and how to use Newton's Method to solve it on a spreadsheet, as discussed in Example 5.12.We conclude that at this aphid density, the aphid population would have a growth and a predation rate that exactly match. (Hence, we also expect that the aphid population would neither increase nor decrease.) What happens if growth and predation rates do not match? In such cases, we expect change to take place. How to analyze such situations will be the topic of a later chapter. 5.6 Harder problems: nding the point of tangency Section 5.4 Learning goals 1.Find a tangent line to a function that goes through some point (not neces- sarily on the graph of the function). 2. Determine tangent lines to functions that contain unspecied parameters. In this section, we present a sample of problems in which the path to a solution is more subtle. In some of these, nding the point of tangency is part of the question. We must use clues about the function to solve for that point, as well as construct the tangent line equation from information supplied. In other cases, the problem involves a parameter whose value is not specied initially. Such examples are meant to hone problem solving skills. Example 5.13 Find any value(s) of the constant asuch that the line y=axis nding the point of tangency.Solution. We do not know the coordinate of any such point, but we label it x0 in Figure 5.10 to denote that it is a denite (as yet to be determined) value. Finding x0is part of the problem.

Does the shape depicted in Figure 5.10 make sense?The tangent line y=axintersects the \u0000x2+3x\u00002 at(x0,f(x0)). Equating yvalues f(x0) =\u0000x2 0+3x0\u00002=ax0. The equation of the tangent line is y=ax. Its slope is a, which is also the derivative of f(x)atx0. Equating slopes gives: f0(x0) =\u00002x0+3=a. We have two equations with two unknowns, ( aandx0). We can solve this system by substituting the value of afrom the rst equation into the second, getting \u0000x2 0+3x0\u00002= (\u00002x0+3)x0.TA NGENT LI NES ,LIN EAR A PPROXI M ATION ,AND NEW TO N Simplifying: \u0000x2 0+3x0\u00002=\u00002x2 0+3x0) x2 0\u00002=0,x0=\u0006p 2. Thus, there are two possible points of tangency, as shown in Figure 5.11. x0y=ax y=f(x) xy Figure 5.11: Two points of tangency Example The solution to Example 5.13 was set up by listing of information provided, deducing a set of equations based on that information, and following a chain of reasoning to arrive at the nal solution. Practicing such multi-step problems is a critical part of training for many elds, including science, medicine, engineering, etc. Example 5.14 Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=f(x) = 1\u0000x2that goes through the point (1,1). Solution. Finding the point of tangency x0is part of the problem. We use the following facts: The tangent line goes through the point (x0,f(x0))on the graph of the function and has slope f0(x0). Consequently, its equation has the form Eqn. (5.2) :y=f(x0) =f0(x0)(x\u0000 x0). For the given function we have f(x0) =1\u0000x2 0,f0(x0) =\u00002x0.

We are told that this line goes through the point (x,y) points of tangency, x0=0,2and two tangent lines that satisfy the given condition. Plugging in these two values of x0into the generic equation for yleads to the equations also nd points of tangency for functions that contain general constants, as the next example illustrates.122 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example 5.15 Shown in Figure 5.12 is the function f(x) =Cx x+a together with one of its tangent lines. The tangent line goes through a point (\u0000d,0). Find the equation of the tangent line. Solution. Finding the point of tangency x0is part of the problem in this case too. We use the same approach, and employ facts (1) and (2) from Example 5.14. We also use, for the specic function a function and its tangent line for Example 5.15.(See Exercise 10 in Chapter 3). Hence, the equation of the tangent line is y=f(x0) +f0(x0)(x\u0000x0) =Cx0 x0+a+Ca (x0+a)2(x\u0000x0). We (x0+a)2(x0(x0+a) +a(x\u0000x0))=C (x0+a)2\u0000 x2 0+ax\u0001 . to realize that in this equation, x0,Candarepresent xed (known) constants, and only x,yare variables. This means that the equation expresses a linear relationship between xandy, as appropriate for a straight line. We know that the point (\u0000d,0)is on this line, so that (plugging in x= \u0000d,y=0), obtain to x0=p ad. Moreover, we can now nd the equation of the tangent line in terms of these parameters. y=C (p ad+a)2(ad+ax)) y=C (p (d/a) +1)2(d+x) where we have simplied by factoring afrom numerator and denominator.

In this chapter we focus on how properties of the rst and second derivative can be used to help up rene curve-sketching techniques. The mathematics we develop in this chapter is used in a variety of applications, many found in Chapter 7. 6.1 Overall shape of the graph of a function Section 6.1 Learning goals 1.Identify that the sign of the rst derivative corresponds to the increasing or decreasing trend of a function. 2.Recognize that the sign of the second derivative corresponds to the concav- ity (curvature) of a function. Increasing and decreasing functions Consider a function given by y=f(x). We rst make the following observa- tions: Mastered Material Check 1. Draw the graphs of two different functions that are increasing on the interval [0,1]. 2. Without using the derivative, how do you identify when a function is decreasing?1. If f0(x)>0 then f(x)isincreasing . 2. If f0(x)<0 then f(x)isdecreasing . By convention, we read graphs from left to right, i.e. in the direction of the positive x-axis, so when we say \"increasing\" we mean that, as we move from left to right, the value of the function gets larger. We can use the same ideas to relate the second derivative to the rst derivative. 1.Iff00(x)>0then f0(x)isincreasing . This means that the slope of the original function is getting steeper (more positive, from left to right). The function curves upwards: we say that it is concave up . See Figure 6.1(a).128 DI FFERENTI AL LI FE SCIEN CES 2.Iff00(x)<0then f0(x)isdecreasing . This means that the slope of the original function is getting shallower (more negative or less positive from left to right). The function curves downwards: we say that it is concave down . See Figure 6.1(b). /facetime_videoSee video summarizing the connection between the shape of the graph of y=f(x), and the derivatives of the function, f0(x),f00(x)of the function.Concavity and points of inflection The second derivative of a function provides information about the curvature of the graph of the function, also called the concavity of the function. In Figure 6.1(a), f(x)isconcave up , so its second derivative is positive. In Figure 6.1(b), f(x)isconcave down , so second derivative is negative. f(x) x f/prime(x) x xf/prime/prime(x)f(x) x f/prime(x) x xf/prime/prime(x)(a) (b) Figure 6.1: In (a) the function is concave up, and its derivative increases (in the positive direction). In (b), the function is concave down, and its derivative decreases. Denition 6.1 Apoint of inflection of a function f(x)is a point xat which the concavity of the function changes (Figure 6.2).SKETCH ING THE GR APH OF A FUNC TION USIN G CA LCULUS TOOLS 129 We can deduce from the denition and previous remarks that at a point of inflection the second derivative changes sign . This is illustrated in Figure 6.2. Note: It is not enough to show that f00(x) =0to conclude that xis an inflection point. We summarize the one-way nature of this relationship in the box and discuss it further in Example 6.1. f(x) inflection point f/prime/prime(x) = 0 f/prime/prime(x)<0 concave downf/prime/prime(x)>0 concave up Figure 6.2: An inflection point is a place where the concavity of a function changes.Inflection points 1. If the function y=f(x)has a point of inflection at x0then f00(x0) =0. 2.If the function y=f(x)satises f00(x0) = 0, we cannot conclude that it has a point of inflection at x0. We must actually check that f00(x)changes sign at x0. Example 6.1 Consider the the functions (a) f1(x) =x3and (b) f2(x) =x4. Show that for both functions, the second derivative is zero at the origin (f00(0) =0) but that only one of these functions actually has an inflection point at x=0. /facetime_videoA summary of Example 6.1, reinforcing the fact that f00(x) =0 is not enough to guarantee an inflection point! We have to check that f00(x)changes sign.Solution. The functions are (a)f1(x) =x3, (b) f2(x) =x4both f00(0) x3has an inflection point atx=0, whereas x4has a local minimum at that point. This is not a contradiction, since f00 2(x)does not change sign at x=0. Mastered Material Check 3. Check that f(x) =x4does not change sign at x=0 by comparing the f(\u00000.1)andf(0.1).Thus, 1(0) an inflection point of x4. In fact, it is a local minimum, as shown in Figure 6.3. \u0006130 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Determining whether f00(x)changes sign We dened an inflection point as a point on the graph of a function where the second derivative changes sign. But how do we detect if this sign change occurs at a given point? We rst state the following result /facetime_videoHow we check where f00(x)changes sign (to identify inflection points). Sign change in a product of factors : If an expression is a product of factors, e.g. g(x) = ( x\u0000a1)n1(x\u0000a2)n2:::(x\u0000 am)nm, then 1. The expression can be zero only at the points x=a1,a2,:::,am. 2.The expression changes sign only at points x=aifor which niis an odd in- teger power. Mastered Material Check 4. How might you determine sign changes for a function which is not given as product of factors? 5. Circle the places where the function depicted below changes sign. 2 2 4 1055Example 6.2 Determine where g (x) =x2(x+2)(x\u00003)4changes sign. Solution. The zeros of g(x)arex=0,\u00002,3. Atx=0and at x=3there is no sign change as the terms x2and(x\u00003)4are always positive. The factor (x+2) goes from negative through zero to positive when xgoes from x<\u00002 tox=\u00002 tox>\u00002. Hence, g(x)only changes sign at x=\u00002.\u0006 Example 6.3 Where does the function f(x) = ( 2/5)x6\u0000x4+xhave inflection point(s)? Solution. The derivatives of f0(x) = ( 12/5)x5\u00004x3+1, f00(x) = 12x4\u000014x2=12x2(x2\u00001) =12x2(x+1)(x\u00001). Here we have completely factored the second derivative. Sign changes can only occur when there are factors with odd powers, such as (x+1)and(x\u00001). These change sign at x=\u00001,1, respectively - making both inflection points. There is NO sign change at x=0, since the factor x2is always positive. \u0006SKETCH ING THE GR APH OF A FUNC TION USIN G CA LCULUS TOOLS 131 6.2 Special points on the graph of a function Section 6.2 Learning goals 1.Dene a zero of a function and be able to identify zeros for simple func- tions (factorizable polynomials). 2.Explain that a function f(x)can have various types of critical points (maxima, minima, and other types) at which f0(x) =0. 3. Find critical points for a given function. 4.Using rst or second derivative tests, classify a given critical point as a maximum, minimum (or neither). In this section we use tools of algebra and calculus to identify special points on the graph of a function. We rst consider the zeros of a function, and then its critical points . Zeros of a function Example 6.4 (Factoring) For the function y=f(x) =x2\u00005x+6, nd zeros by factoring. Solution. This polynomial has factors f(x) = ( x\u00003)(x\u00002). Zeros =0. Hence, there are two zeros, x=2,3. \u0006 Mastered Material Check 5. What is another term used for zeros of a function? Example 6.5 Find the zeros of the function y =f(x) =x3\u00003x2+x. Solution. We can factor this function into f(x) =x(x2\u00003x+1). From this we see that x=0is one of the desired zeros of f. To nd the others, we apply the quadratic formula to the second factor, obtaining x1,2=1 2(3\u0006p 32\u00004) =1 2(3\u0006p 5). Thus, there are a three zeros in this case: x=0,1 2(3+p 5),1 2(3\u0000p 5). \u0006 Example 6.6 Find zeros of the function y =f(x) =x3\u0000x\u00003. Solution. This polynomial does not factor into integers, nor is it easy to apply a cubic formula (analogous to the quadratic formula). However, as we saw in Example 5.10, Newton's method leads to an accurate approximation for the only zero of this function, ( x\u00191.6717) \u0006132 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR FE SCIEN CES Critical points Denition 6.2 Acritical point of the function f(x)is any point xat which the rst derivative is zero, i.e. f0(x) =0. Figure 6.4: A critical point (place where f0(x) =0) can be a local maximum, local minimum, or neither.Clearly, a critical point occurs whenever the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function is zero, i.e. the tangent line is horizontal. Figure 6.4 shows several possible shapes of the graph of a function close to a critical point. From left to right, these are a local maximum , alocal minimum and twoinflection points . /facetime_videoA summary of types of critical points and how to tell them apart.Critical points play an important role in many scientic applications, as described in Chapter 7. Hence, we seek criteria to determine whether a critical point is a local maximum, minimum, or neither. Example 6.7 Consider the function y=f(x) =x3+3x2+ax+1. For what range of values of a are there no critical points for this function? Solution. We compute the rst derivative f0(x) =3x2+6x+a. A critical point would occur whenever 0=f0(x), which implies 0=3x2+6x+a. This is a quadratic equation whose solutions are x1,2=\u00006\u0006p 36\u00004a\u00013 6. There two real solutions provided the discriminant is positive, 36\u000012a>0. Mastered Material Check 6. Why are there no critical points when 36\u000012a<0 for the function f(x?) =x3+3x2+ax+1However, when 36\u000012a<0(which corresponds to a>3), there are no real solutions and consequently no critical points. \u0006 What happens close to a critical point In Figure 6.5 we contrast the behaviour of two functions (top row), each with a different type of critical point. We compare their rst and second derivatives close to that point (second and third rows, respectively). In each case, the rst derivative f0(x) =0 at the critical point. Near the local maximum (moving from left to right), the slope of f(x) transitions from positive to zero (at the critical point) to negative. This means that f0(x)is adecreasing function, as indicated in Figure 6.5. Since changes in the rst derivative are measured by itsderivative f00(x), we nd that theSKETCH ING THE GR APH OF A FUNC TION USIN G CA LCULUS min xf(x) xf/prime/prime(x) local maximum, f(x) is concave down, f0(x)is decreasing, so that f00(x)is negative. Close to a local minimum, f(x)is concave up, f0(x)is increasing, so that f00(x)is positive. second derivative is negative at a local maximum. The converse is true near a local minimum (right column in Figure 6.5). We collect and summarize conclusions about derivatives below.

In Section 1.4, we used elementary reasoning about power functions to sketch the graph of simple polynomials. Now that we have learned more advanced calculus techniques, we can hone such methods to produce more accurate sketches of the graph of a function. We devote this section to illustrating some examples.SKETCH ING THE GR APH OF A FUNC TION USIN G CA LCULUS TOOLS 135 Example 6.8 Sketch the graph of the function B(x) =C(x2\u0000x3).Assume that C >0is constant. /facetime_videoSteps in the calculations of Example 6.8.Solution. To prepare, we compute the derivatives: Mastered Material Check 8. What is the independent variable in Example 6.8? The dependent variable? 9. Given our discussion on \"considering the powers\" for Example 6.8, add a reasonable scale to each of x-axes for the graphs in Figure 6.6.B0(x) =C(2x\u00003x2),B00(x) =C(2\u00006x). 1.Zeros. We start by nding the zeros of the function. Factoring makes this easy. B(x) =0, we nd 0=C(x2\u0000x3) =Cx2(1\u0000x),) ) x=0,1. 2.Consider the powers. Reasoning about the powers as in Chapter 1, we surmise that close to the origin, x2dominates (producing a parabolic shape) whereas, far away, \u0000x3dominates (producing the shape of an inverted cubic). We show this in a preliminary sketch, Figure 6.6. xB(x) xB(x) xB(x) close to 0 0 far from 0 Figure 6.6: Figure for the function B(x) = C(x2\u0000x3)in Example 6.8 showing which power dominates. 3.First derivative. To nd critical ) x=0,2 3. By considering the sketch in Figure 6.6, we can see that x=0is a local minimum, and x=2/3a local maximum. Conrmation of this comes from the second derivative. 4.Second derivative. From the second derivative, B00(0) =2>0, local minimum. Further, B00(2/3) sox=2/3 is a local maximum, as expected. 5.Classifying the critical points. Now identifying where B00(x) FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES we also note that the second derivative changes sign here: i.e. for x<1/3, B00(x)>0and for x>1/3,B00(x)<0. We may conclude that there is an inflection point at x=1/3. The nal sketch, now labeled, is given in Figure 6.7. \u0006 1/32/31local max inflection local minxB(x) Figure 6.7: A sketch of B(x) =C(x2\u0000x3)in Example 6.8.Example 6.9 Sketch the graph of the function y =f(x) =8x5+5x4\u000020x3 Solution. This example is more challenging, but similar ideas apply. 1.Zeros. Factoring the expression for yand then using the quadratic formula leads to y=x3(8x2+5x\u000020).) x=0,\u00005 16\u00061 16p 665. In decimal form, these are approximately x=0,1.3,\u00001.92. 2.Consider the powers. The highest power is 8x5, so far from the origin we expect typical positive odd function behaviour. The lowest power is \u000020x3, which means that close to zero, we expect to see a negative cubic. This implies that the function \"turns around\", creating local maxima and minima. We draw a rough sketch in Figure 6.8. xy Figure 6.8: y=f(x) =8x5+5x4\u000020x3. From Example 6.9, this function behaves roughly like the negative cubic near the origin, and like 8 x5for large x.3.First derivative. Calculating the derivative of f(x)and then factoring leads to dy dx=f0(x) =40x4+20x3\u000060x2=20x2(2x+3)(x\u00001) so this derivative is zero at: x=0,1,\u00003/2. We expect critical points at these places. 4.Second derivative. We calculate the second derivative and factor to obtain d2y dx2=f00(x) =160x3+60x2\u0000120x=20x(8x2+3x\u00006). Thus, the second 16+1 16p 201,\u00003 16\u00001 16p 201. roots can be approximated by: x=0,0.69,\u00001.07.Mastered Material Check (a) Verify the given zeros of the second derivative of Example 6.9. 10.Classifying the critical points. To identify the types of critical points, we use the second derivative test. f00(0) =0 so the test is inconclusive at x=0. f00(1) =20(8+3\u00006)>0 implies a local minimum x=1, and f00(\u00003/2) =\u0000225<0 implies a local maximum at x=\u00003/2.

Figure 6.10 conrms our conclusions. \u0006 6.4 Summary 1.We can improve the accuracy of a sketch of a function f(x)by examining its derivatives. For example, if f0(x)>0then f(x)is increasing, and iff0(x)<0, then f(x)is decreasing. Further, if this cor- responds to f0(x)increasing, which means f(x)is f00(x)changes x0, then x0is a point of inflection off(x): a point where its concavity changes. 3.Iff0(x0) =0, then x0is a critical point of the function f(x). A critical point needs to be further tested to determine whether it is a local minimum, local maximum or neither. 4.Given a critical point x0(where f0(x0) =0), the rst derivative test examines the sign of f0(x)near x0. If the sign pattern of f0(x)is+,0,\u0000 (from left to right as we cross x0), then x0is a local maximum. If the sign pattern is\u0000,0,+, then x0is a local minimum. 5.Given a critical point x0(where f0(x0) =0), the second derivative test examines the sign of f00(x0). Iff00(x0)<0, then x0is a local maximum. Iff00(x0)>0, then x0is a local minimum. If f00(x0) =0, the second derivative test is inconclusive. 6.Aglobal maximum and minimum can only be identied after comparing the values of the function at all critical points and endpoints of the interval.

In this chapter, we con- centrate on optimization problems, where nding \"the largest,\" \"the smallest,\" or \"the best\" answer is the goal. We apply some of the techniques developed in earlier chapters to nd local and global maxima and minima. A new Mastered Material Check 1. How do you nd the critical points of a function f(x)?challenge in this chapter is translating a word-problem into a mathematical problem. We start with elementary examples, and work to more complex situations with biological motivation. 7.1 Simple biological optimization problems Section 7.1 Learning goals 1.Given a function, nd the derivative of that function and identify all critical points. 2.Using a combination of sketching and tests for critical points developed in Section 6.2, diagnose the type of critical point. In the rst examples, the function to optimize is specied, making the problem simply one of carefully applying calculus methods. Density dependent (logistic) growth in a population Biologists often notice that the growth rate of a population depends not only on the size of the population, but also on how crowded it is. Constant growth is not sustainable. When individuals have to compete for resources, nesting sites, mates, or food, they cannot invest time nor energy in reproduction, leading to a decline in the rate of growth of the population. Such population growth is called density dependent growth . One common example of density dependent growth is called the logistic growth law. Here it is assumed that the growth rate of the population, G146 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES depends on the density of the population, N, as follows: G(N) =rN\u0012K\u0000N K\u0013 . Here Nis the independent variable , and G(N)is the function of interest. Mastered Material Check 2. Give an example of units for N. 3. What units might Gcarry?All other quantities are constant: r>0 is a constant, called the intrinsic growth rate , and K>0is a constant, called the carrying capacity . It represents the popula- tion density that a given environment can sustain. Importantly, when differentiating G, we treat randKas \"numbers\". A generic sketch of Gas a function of Nis shown in Figure 7.1. 0 K/2 KNG Figure 7.1: In logistic growth, the pop- ulation growth rate rate Gdepends on population size Nas shown here.Example 7.1 (Logistic growth rate) Answer the following questions: a)Find the population density N that leads to the maximal growth rate G (N). b)Find the value of the maximal growth in terms of r ,K. c)For what population size is the growth rate zero? Solution. We can expand G(N): G(N) =rN\u0012K\u0000N K\u0013 =rN\u0000r KN2, from which it is apparent that G(N)is a polynomial in powers of N, with constant coefcients randr/K. a)To nd N=K 2. critical point, but is it a maximum? We check this in one of several ways. First, a sketch in Figure 7.1 reveals a downwards- opening parabola. This conrms a local maximum. Alternately, we can apply a tool from Section 6.2 such as the second derivative test : G00(N) =\u00002r K<0) G(N)concave down ) N=K 2is a local maximum Thus, the population density with the greatest growth rate is K/2. b)The maximal growth rate is found by evaluating the function Gat the critical point, c)To nd the population size at which the growth rate is zero, we set G=0 and solve for N: G(N) =rN\u0012K\u0000N K\u0013 =0. There two solutions. One is trivial: N=0. (This is biologically interesting in the sense that it rules out the ancient idea of spontaneous generation - a defunct theory that held that life can arise on its own, from dust or air. If N=0, the growth rate is also 0, so no population spontaneously arises according to logistic growth.) The second solution, N=Kmeans that the population is at its \"carrying capacity\". \u0006 We return to this type of growth in Chapter 13. Cell size for maximal nutrient accumulation rate According to the model of Section 1.2, the nutrient absorption and consump- tion rates, A(r),C(r), of A(r) =k1S=4k1pr2,C(r) =k2V=4 3pk2r3, fork1,k2>0constants. The net rate of increase of nutrients, which is the difference of the two is: Mastered Material Check 4. Give example units for each ofA(r),C(r)andN(r). Are there restrictions in place?N(r) =A(r)\u0000C(r) =4k1pr2\u00004 3pk2r3. (7.1) This quantity is a function of the radius rof the cell. Example 7.2 Determine the radius of the cell for which the net rate of increase of nutrients N (r)is largest. Solution. We are asked to maximize N(r)with respect to r. We rst nd critical points of N(r), keeping in mind that 8k1pand4k2pare constant for the purpose of differentiation. Critical points occur identify the type of critical point, we use the second derivative test N00(r) =8k1p\u00008k2pr=8p(k1\u0000k2r). Substituting second derivative is negative at at r=2k1/k2, verifying that this is a local maximum. Hence the net rate of nutrient uptake is greatest for cells of radius r=2k1/k2. \u0006148 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 7.2 Optimization with a constraint Section 7.2 Learning goals 1.Set up an optimization word problem involving formulae for volume and surface area of geometric solids. 2. Identify a constraint in an optimization problem. 3.Use the constraint to eliminate one of the independent variables, and nd a desired critical point. (As before, this includes classifying the critical point as a local minimum, maximum or neither.) In the next examples, identifying the function to optimize is part of the challenge. We also consider cases with more than one independent variable, where a constraint is used to eliminate all but one. A cylindrical cell with minimal surface area Not all cells are spherical. Some are cylindrical or sausage shaped. We explore how minimization of surface area would determine the overall shape of a cylindrical cell with a circular cross-section. The volume of the cell is assumed to be xed, because the cytoplasm in its interior cannot be \"compressed\". However, suppose that the cell has a \"rubbery\" membrane that tends to take on the smallest surface area possible. In physical language, the elastic energy stored in the membrane tends to a minimum. We want to nd the proportions of the cylinder (that is, the ratio of length to radius) so that the cell has minimal surface area . Lr L 2r Figure 7.2: Properties of a cylinder Recall the following properties for a cylinder of length Land radius r: The volume of a cylinder is the product of its base area, A, and its height, L. That is, V=AL. For a cylinder with circular cross-section, V=pr2L. As in Figure 7.2, a cylinder can be \"cut and unrolled\" into a rectangle withOPTI MI ZATIO N 149 side lengths Land2pr, where ris the radius of the circular cross-section. The surface area is the product of these side lengths, Sside=2prL. Mastered Material Check 5. If a cylindrical cell has volume 100 mm3and length 10 mm, what is its radius? 6. What is the surface area of a cylindrical cell with volume 100 mm3and length 10 mm?If the \"ends\" of the cylinder are two flat circular caps then the sum of the areas of these two ends is Sends=2pr2. While in a real cell, the end caps would not be actually flat, for simplicity, we assume flat, circular ends. The total surface area of the cylinder with flat ends is then S=2prL+2pr2. Mathematically, our problem can be restated as follows Example 7.3 Minimize the surface area S=2prL+2pr2of the cell, given that its volume V =pr2L=K is constant1.1I would like to thank Prof Nima Geffen (Tel Aviv University) for providing the inspiration for this example.Solution. The shape of the cell depends on both the length, L, and the radius, r, of the cylinder. However, these are not independent. They are related to one another because the volume of the cell has to be constant. This is an example of an optimization problem with a constraint , i.e., a condition that has to be satised. The constraint is \"the volume is xed\" , i.e., V=pr2L=K, where K>0is a constant. This constraint allows us to eliminate one variables. For example, solving for L, we have L=K pr2. (7.2) substituting this pr2+2pr2) S(r) =2K r+2pr2, where a function of a single independent variable, r(Kandpare constants). We have formulated the mathematical problem: nd the minimum of S(r). We compute derivatives to classify S0(r) =\u00002K r2+4pr,S00(r) =4K r3+4p. Since is always positive, so S(r)is concave up. Any critical point we nd is thus automatically a minimum. (In Exercise 7 we also consider the rst derivative test as practice.) Setting S0(r) =0: S0(r) =\u00002K r2+4pr=0.150 THE LI FE SCIEN CES obtain 2K r=\u0012K 2p\u00131/3 . We this cell from Eqn. 7.2. L=\u00124K p\u00131/3 . (Details are left for Exercise 7). We can nally characterize the shape of the cell. One way is to specify the ratio of its radius to its length. Based on our previous results, we nd that ratio to be:L r=2 (Exercise 7). This implies that L=2rwhich coincides with the length of a diameter of the same circle. Mastered Material Check 7. Redo Example 7.3 for a cell with xed volume 100 mm3.This means the \"cylindrical cell\" with rubbery membrane would be short and fat - something almost like a sphere of radius rwith flattened ends. Some cells do grow as long cylindrical laments, but such growth is inconsistent with an elastic membrane or a minimal surface area. (In fact, lamentous growth is one way for cells to maximize their surface area, and reduce the challenge of absorbing nutrients.) \u0006 Wine for Kepler's wedding In 1613, Kepler set out to purchase a few barrels of wine for his wedding party. To compute the cost, the merchant would plunge a measuring rod through the tap hole, as shown in Figure 7.3 and measure the length Lof the \"wet\" part of rod. The cost would be set at a value proportional to L. Kepler noticed that barrels come in different shapes. Some are tall and skinny, while others are squat and fat. He conjectured that some shapes would contain larger volumes for a given length L, i.e. would contain more wine for the same price. Knowing mathematics, he set out to determine which barrel shape would be the best bargain for his wedding. L Figure 7.3: Barrels come in various shapes. But the cost of a barrel of wine was deter- mined by the length L(dashed blue line segment) of the wet portion of the rod inserted into the tap hole. Kepler gured out which barrels contain the most wine for a given price. Kepler sought the wine barrel that contains the most wine for a given cost. This is equivalent to asking which cylinder has the largest volumeOPTI MI ZATIO N 151 for a xed (constant) length L. Below, we solve this optimization problem. An alternate approach is to seek the wine barrel that costs least for a given volume (Exercise 14), which leads to the same result. Example 7.4 Find the proportions (height:radius) of the cylinder with largest volume for a xed length L (dashed line segment in Figure 7.3). Solution. We make the following assumptions: 1. the barrel is a simple cylinder, as shown in Figure 7.4, 2.the tap-hole (normally sealed to avoid leaks) is half-way up the height of the barrel, and 3. the barrel is full to the top with wine. Mastered Material Check 8. Give two different examples of barrel dimensions which would both yeild a volume of 160L.Letr,hdenote the radius and height of the barrel. These two variables uniquely determine the shape as well as the volume of the barrel. Note that because the barrel is assumed to be full, the volume of the cylinder is the same as the volume of wine, namely V=base area\u0002height.) V=pr2h. (7.3) The rod used to \"measure\" the amount of wine (and hence determine the cost of the barrel) is shown as the diagonal of length Lin Figure 7.4. Because the cylinder walls are perpendicular to its base, the length Lis the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle whose other sides have lengths 2randh/2. (This follows from the assumption that the tap hole is half-way up the side.) Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, L2= (2r)2+\u0012h 2\u00132 . (7.4) The problem can now be stated mathematically: maximize Vin Eqn. (7.3) subject to a xed value of Lin Eqn. (7.4) . The fact that Lis xed means that we have a constraint , as before, that we use to reduce the number of variables in the problem. h Lh 2 2r Figure 7.4: We simplify the problem to a cylindrical barrel with diameter 2rand height h. We assumed that the height of the tap-hole is h/2. Length Ldenotes the \"wet\" portion of the merchant's rod, used to determine the cost. We observe a Pythagorean triangle formed by the dashed line segments.Expanding the squares in the constraint and solving for r2leads to L2=4r2+h2 4) r2=1 4\u0012 L2\u0000h2 4\u0013 . When we use this to eliminate rfrom the expression for V, THE LI FE SCIEN CES The function V(h)is positive for hin the range 0\u0014h\u00142L, and V=0at the two endpoints of the interval. We can restrict attention to this interval since otherwise V<0, which makes no physical sense. Since V(h)is a smooth function, we anticipate that somewhere inside this range of values there should be a maximal volume. Computing rst and second We verify that this solution is a local maximum by the following reasoning. The second derivative V00(h) =\u00003 8ph<0is always negative for any positive value of h, soV(h)is concave down for h>0, which conrms a local maximum. We also noted that V(r)is smooth, positive within the range of interest and zero at the endpoints. As there is only one critical point in that range, it must be a local maximum. Finally, we nd the radius of the barrel by plugging the optimal hinto the constraint the optimal barrel can now be characterized. One way to do so is to specify the ratio of its height to its radius. (Tall skinny barrels have a large h/rratio, and squat fat ones have a low ratio.) By the above reasoning, the ratio of h/rfor the optimal barrel is h r=2Lp 3 1p 3p 2L=2p 2. (7.5) Hence, for greatest economy, Kepler would have purchased barrels with height to radius ratio of 2p 2=2.82\u00193. \u0006Mastered Material Check 9. If all barrels had a radius of 25cm, given the result Example 7.4, what would be the best barrel height? 10. What would the volume of such a barrel be? 11. Consider a barrel with radius 25cm and height 100cm. What is this barrel's volume? 7.3 Checking endpoints Section 7.3 Learning goals 1. Recognize the distinction between local and global extrema. 2. Find the global minimum or maximum in a given word problem.OPTI MI ZATIO N 153 In some cases, the optimal value of a function does not occur at any of its local maxima, but rather at one of the endpoints of an interval. Here we consider such an example. Example 7.5 (Maximal perimeter) The area of a rectangle with side lengths xandyisA=xy. Suppose that the variable xis only allowed to take on values in the range 0.5\u0014x\u00144. Find the dimensions of the rectangle having largest perimeter whose xed area is A =1. Mastered Material Check 12. How do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle? 13. Why can a negative root ofP0(x) =0 in Example 7.5 be rejected as irrelevant?Solution. The perimeter of a rectangle whose sides are length x,yis P=x+y+x+y=2x+2y. We are to maximize this quantity subject to the area of the rectangle being xed, A=xy=1. This is the constraint. We use it to solve for and to eliminate yfrom P. y=1 x,) P(x) =2x+2 x. We satisfying x2=1orx=\u00061. We reject the negative root as irrelevant. We have found that P00(x)>0for all x>0, so the critical point is a local minimum ! This is clearly not the maximum we were looking for. This example reinforces the importance of diagnostic tests for the type of critical point. 11.522.533.54246810 xP(x)perimeter Figure 7.5: In Example 7.5, the critical point is a local minimum. The maximum occurs at the right end point of the interval 0.5\u0014x\u00144.Next, checking the endpoints of the interval, we evaluate P(4) =8.5and P(0.5) =5. The largest perimeter for the rectangle thus occurs when x=4, at the right endpoint of the domain, as shown in Figure 7.5. \u0006 Mastered Material Check 14. Use Figure 7.5 to estimate the side length xwhen P(x) =6. 15. Verify your estimate algebraically.In Appendix G.4, we provide further examples of optimization in the context of geometric solids. 7.4 Optimal foraging Section 7.4 Learning goals 1.Explain the development of a simple model for an animal foraging (col- lecting food to gain energy) in a food patch. 2.Interpret graphs of the rate of energy gain in various food patches, and explain the distinctions between types of food patches. 3.Determine how long to spend foraging in a food patch in order to optimize the average rate of energy gain per unit time.154 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Animals spend much of their time foraging - searching for food. Time is limited, since when the sun goes down, the risk of becoming food (to a predator) increases, and the likelihood of nding food decreases. Individuals who are most successful at nding food over that limited time have the greatest chance of surviving. It is argued by biologists that evolution tends to optimize animal behaviour by selecting those that are faster, stronger, or more t, or - in this case - most efcient at nding food. In this section, we investigate a model for optimal foraging. We follow the basic principles of [Stephens and Krebs, 1986] and [Charnov, 1976]. food patch timet ftravel time Figure 7.6: A bird travels daily to forage in a food patch. We want to determine how long it should stay in the patch to optimize its overall average energy gain per unit time. Notation . We dene the following notation: t= travel time between nest and food patch (this is considered to be time that is unavoidably wasted). t=residence time in the patch (i.e. how long to spend foraging in one patch), also called foraging time , f(t)= total energy gained by foraging in a patch for time t. Energy gain in food patches. In some patches, food is ample and found Mastered Material Check 16. Which of the energy gain functions in Figure 7.7 are strictly increasing?quickly, while in others, it takes time and effort to obtain. The typical time needed to nd food is reflected by various energy gain functions f(t)shown in Figure 7.7. Example 7.6 (Energy gain versus patch residence time) For each panel in Figure 7.7, explain what the graph of the total energy gain f(t)is saying about the type of food patch: how easy or hard is it to nd food? Solution. The types of food patches are as follows: 1.The energy gain is linearly proportional to time spent in the patch. In this case, the patch has so much food that it is never depleted. It would make sense to stay in such a patch for as long as possible. 2.Energy gain is independent of time spent. The animal gets the full quantity as soon as it gets to the patch.OPTI MI ZATIO N 155 tf(t) tf(t) tf(t) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 7.7: Examples of various total energy gain f(t)for a given foraging time t. The shapes of these functions determine how hard or easy it is to extract food from a food patch. 3.Food is gradually depleted, (the total energy gain levels off to some constant as tincreases). There is \"diminishing return\" for staying longer, suggesting that it is best not to stay too long. 4.The reward for staying longer in this patch increases: the net energy gain is concave up ( f00(t)>0), so its slope is increasing. 5.It takes time to begin to gain energy. After some time, the gain increases, but eventually, the patch is depleted. 6.Staying too long in such a patch is disadvantageous, resulting in net loss of energy. It is important to leave this patch early enough to avoid that loss. \u0006Mastered Material Check 17. Which model(s) can you automatically dismiss as not very biologically realistic? Example 7.7 Consider the hypothetical patch energy function f(t) =Emaxt k+twhere E max,k>0,are constants . (7.6) a)Match this function to one of the panels in Figure 7.7. b)Interpret the meanings of the constants E max,k. Solution. a)The function resembles Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Figure 1.8). In Figure 7.7, Panel (3) is the closest match. b)From Chapter 1, Emaxis the horizontal asymptote, corresponding to an upper bound for the total amount of energy that can be extracted from the patch. The parameter khas units of time and controls the steepness of the function. Foraging for a time t=k, leads the animal to obtain half of the total available energy, since f(k) =Emax/2 (Exercise 27(a)). \u0006156 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example 7.8 (Currency to optimize) We can assume that animals try to maximize the average energy gain per unit time , dened by the ratio: R(t) =Total energy gained total time spent, Write down R (t)for the assumed patch energy function Eqn. 7.6. Solution. The 'total time spent' is a sum of the xed amount of time t traveling, and time tforaging. The 'total energy gained' is f(t). Thus, for the patch function f(t)assumed in Eqn. (7.6), Mastered Material Check 18. What units might be used in the function R(t)?R(t) =f(t) (t+t)=Emaxt (k+t)(t+t). (7.7) \u0006 We can now problem: Find the time tthat maximizes R(t). In nding such a twe are determining the optimal residence time . Example 7.9 Use tools of calculus and curve-sketching to nd and classify the critical points of R (t)in Eqn. (7.7) . Solution. We rst sketch R(t), focusing on t>0 for biological relevance. Fort\u00190, we have R(t)\u0019(Emax/kt)t, which is a linearly increasing function. Ast!\u00a5,R(t)!Emaxt/t2!0, so the graph eventually decreases to zero. These two conclusions are shown in Figure 7.8 (left panel), and strongly suggest that there should be a local maximum in the range 0<t<\u00a5, as shown in the right panel of Fig 7.8. Since the function is continuous for t>0, this tR(t) tR(t) Figure 7.8: In Example 7.9 we rst compose a rough sketch of the average rate of energy gain R(t)in Eqn. (7.7) . The graph is linear near the origin, and decays to zero at large t. sketch veries that there is a local maximum for some positive tvalue.OPTI MI ZATIO N 157 To nd a local maximum, we compute R0(t)using the quotient rule (Exercise 27c), and set R0(t) =0: R0(t) =Emaxkt\u0000t2 (k+t)2(t+t)2=0. (7.8) This can only be satised if the numerator is zero, that is kt\u0000t2=0) t1,2=\u0006p kt. Rejecting the (irrelevant) negative root, we deduce that the critical point of the function R(t)istcrit=p kt. The sketch in Figure 7.8, veries that this critical point is a local maximum. \u0006 Example 7.10 For practice, use one of the calculus tests for critical points to show that t crit=p ktis a local maximum for the function R (t)in Eqn. (7.7) . Solution. R(t)is a rational function, so a second derivative is messy. Instead, we apply the rst derivative test (Section 6.2), that is, we check the sign of R0(t)on both sides of the critical point. Eqn. (7.8) gives R0(t). Its denominator is positive, so the sign of R0(t)is determined by its numerator, (kt\u0000t2). Thus, R0(t)>0 for t<tcrit, and R0(t)<0 for t>tcrit. This conrms that the function increases up to the critical point and decreases afterwards, so the critical point is a local maximum, henceforth denoted tmax. \u0006 To optimize the average rate of energy gain, R(t), we found that the animal should stay in the patch for a duration of t=tmax=p kt. Mastered Material Check 19. Given tmaxis the duration of time an animal should stay in a patch, and t is travelling time, explain why the constant kis also in units of time.Example 7.11 Determine the average rate of energy gain at this optimal patch residence time, i.e. nd the maximal average rate of energy gain. Solution. (7.9) The reader is asked to ll in the steps for this calculation in Exercise 27(d). \u0006 In Appendix G.5, we extend this example by considering a more general problem. Geometric arguments play a key role in that discussion. 7.5 Summary 1.Optimization is a process of nding critical points, and identifying local and global maxima/minima. 2.A scientic problem that address \"biggest/smallest, best, most efcient\" is often reducible to an optimization problem.158 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 3.As with all mathematical models, translating scientic observations and reasonable assumptions into mathematical terms is an important rst step. 4.

You are building a fence to completely enclose part of your backyard for a vegetable garden. You have already purchased material for a fence of length 100 ft. What is the largest rectangular area that this fence can enclose? 7.12. Two gardens. A fence of length 100ft is to be used to enclose two gardens. One garden is to have a circular shape, and the other to be square. Determine how the fence should be cut so that the sum of the areas inside both gardens is as large as possible. 7.13. Dimensions of an open box. A rectangular piece of cardboard with dimension 12 cm by24 cm is to be made into an open box (i.e., no lid) by cutting out squares from the corners and then turning up the sides.

In this exercise we follow an alternate approach to the most economical wine barrel problem posed by Kepler (as in Example 7.4). Through this approach, we nd the proportions (height:radius) of the cylinder that minimizes the length Lof the wet rod in Figure 7.3 for a xed volume.

Find the shortest path that would take a milk-maid from her house at (10,10 )to fetch water at the river located along thex-axis and then to the thirsty cow at (3,5). 7.17. Water and ice. Why does ice float on water? Because the density of ice is lower! In fact, water is the only common liquid whose maximal density occurs above its freezing temperature. This phenomenon favours the survival of aquatic life by preventing ice from forming at the bottoms of lakes. According to the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, a mass of water that occupies one liter at 0\u000eC occupies a volume (in liters) of V=\u0000aT3+bT2\u0000cT+1 atT\u000eC where 0\u0014T\u001430 and where the coefcients are a=6.79\u000210\u00008,b=8.51\u000210\u00006,c=6.42\u000210\u00005. Find the temperature between 0\u000eC and 30\u000eC at which the density of water is the greatest. ( hint: maximizing the density is equivalent to minimizing the volume. Why is this?). 7.18. Drug doses and sensitivity. Thereaction R(x)of a patient to a drug dose of size xdepends on the type of drug. For a certain drug, it was determined that a good description of the relationship is: R(x) =Ax2(B\u0000x) where AandBare positive constants. The sensitivity of the patient's body to the drug is dened to be R0(x). (a)For what value of xis the reaction a maximum, and what is that maximum reaction value? (b)For what value of xis the sensitivity a maximum? What is the maximum sensitivity? 7.19. Thermoregulation in a swarm of bees. In the winter, honeybees sometimes escape the hive and form a tight swarm in a tree, where, by shivering, they can produce heat and keep the swarm temperature elevated. Heat energy is lost through the surface of the swarm at a rate propor- tional to the surface area ( k1Swhere k1>0is a constant). Heat energy is produced inside the swarm at a rate proportional to the mass of the swarm (which you may take to be a constant times the volume). We assume that the heat production is k2Vwhere k2>0 is constant. Swarms that are not large enough may lose more heat than they can produce, and then they die. The heat depletion rate is the loss rate minus the production rate. Assume that the swarm is spherical.164 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Find the size of the swarm for which the rate of depletion of heat energy is greatest. 7.20. Cylinder inside a sphere. Work through the steps for the calculations and classication of critical point(s) in Example G.2, that is, nd the dimensions of the largest cylinder that would t in a sphere of radius R. 7.21. Circular cone circumscribed about a sphere. A right circular cone is circumscribed about a sphere of radius 5. Find the dimension of this cone if its volume is to be a minimum. Note: this is a rather challenging geometric problem. 7.22. Optimal reproductive strategy. Animals that can produce many healthy babies that survive to the next generation are at an evolution- ary advantage over other, competing, species. However, too many young produce a heavy burden on the parents (who must feed and care for them). If this causes the parents to die, the advantage is lost. Fur- ther, competition of the young with one another for food and parental attention jeopardizes the survival of these babies. Suppose that the evolutionary Advantage Ato the parents of having litter size xis A(x) =ax\u0000bx2. Suppose that the Cost Cto the parents of having litter size xis C(x) =mx+e. TheNet Reproductive Gain Gis dened as G=A\u0000C. (a) Explain the expressions for A,CandG. (b) At what litter size is the advantage, A, greatest? (c) At what litter size is there least cost to the parents? (d) At what litter size is the Net Reproductive Gain greatest?. 7.23. Behavioural Ecology. Social animals that live in groups can spend less time scanning for predators than solitary individuals. However, they waste time ghting with the other group members over the avail- able food. There is some group size at which the net benet is greatest because the animals spend the least time on these unproductive activi- ties - and thus can spend time on feeding, mating, etc. Assume that for a group of size x, the fraction of time spent scanning for predators is S(x) =A1 (x+1) and the fraction of time spent ghting with other animals over food is F(x) =B(x+1)2OPTI MI ZATIO N 165 where A,Bare constants. Find the size of the group for which the time wasted on scanning and ghting is smallest. 7.24. Logistic growth.

Logistic growth with harvesting. Consider a sh population of density Ngrowing logistically, i.e. with rate of growth R(N) = rN(1\u0000N/K)where randKare positive constants. The rate of harvesting (i.e. removal) of the population is h(N) =qEN where E, the effort of the shermen, and q, the catchability of this type of sh, are positive constants. At what density of sh does the growth rate exactly balance the harvesting rate? This density is called the maximal sustainable yield: MSY . 7.26. Conservation of a harvested population. Conservationists insist that the density of sh should never be allowed to go below a level at which growth rate of the sh exactly balances with the harvesting rate. At this level, the harvesting is at its maximal sustainable yield. If more sh are taken, the population keeps dropping and the sh eventually go extinct. What level of shing effort should be used to lead to the greatest harvest at this maximal sustainable yield? Note: you should rst complete the Exercise 25. 7.27. Optimal foraging.

Rate of net energy gain while foraging and traveling. Animals spend energy in traveling and foraging. In some environments this energy loss is a signicant portion of the energy budget. In such cases, it is customary to assume that to survive, an individual would optimize the rate of netenergy gain, dened as Q(t) =Net energy gained total time spent=Energy gained\u0000Energy lost total time spent(7.10) Assume that the animal spends penergy units per unit time in all activities (including foraging and traveling). Assume that the energy gain in the patch (\"patch energy function\") is given by Eqn. (7.6). Find the optimal patch time, that is the time at which Q(t)is maxi- mized in this scenario. 7.29. Maximizing net energy gain: Suppose that the situation requires an animal to maximize its net energy gained E(t)dened as E(t) = energy gained while foraging \u0000energy spent while foraging and traveling. (This means that E(t) =f(t)\u0000r(t+t)where ris the rate of energy spent per unit time and tis the xed travel time).

(b)Indicate a condition of the form k<?that is required for existence of this critical point.8 Introducing the chain rule Mastered Material Check 1. Give an example each of: (a) a power function, (b) a polynomial function, and (c) a rational function.So far, examples were purposefully chosen to focus on power, polynomial, and rational functions that are each relatively easy to differentiate. We now introduce the differentiation rule that opens up our repertoire to more elaborate examples involving composite functions . This allows us to model more biological processes. We dedicate this chapter to the chain rule and its applications. 8.1 The chain rule Section 8.1 Learning goals 1.Summarize function composition and express a composite function in terms of the underlying composed functions. 2.Produce the chain rule of differentiation and apply it to nd the derivative of a composite function. Function composition Consider Figure 8.1 which depicts a function composition: an independent variable, x, is used to evaluate a function, and the result, u=f(x)then acts as an input to a second function, g. The nal value is y=g(u) =g(f(x)). x f g yu Figure 8.1: Function composition. We refer to this two-step function operation as function composition . Example 8.1 Consider the functions f(x) =pxandg(x) =x2+1. Deter- mine the FFERENTI AL CALC = (px)2+1=x+1 (provided x\u00150.) b)Forh2, the functions are applied in the reversed order so that h2(x) =p x2+1 (for any real x). We note that the domains of the two functions are slightly different: h1is only dened for x\u00150since f(x)is not dened x, whereas h2is dened for all x. \u0006 Mastered Material Check 2. Can you dene the domain of a function? 3. What are the domains of f(x) andg(x)found in Example 8.2?Example 8.2 Express the function h(x) =5(x3\u0000x2)10as the composition of two simpler functions. Solution. We can write this in terms of the two functions f(x) =x3\u0000x2and g(x) =5x10. Then h(x) =g(f(x)). \u0006 The chain rule of differentiation Given a composite function y=f(g(x)), we require a rule for differentiating y with respect to x. Ify=g(u)andu=f(x)are both differentiable functions and y=g(f(x))is the composite function, then the chain rule of differentiation states that dy dx=dy dudu dx. Informally, the chain rule states that the change in ywith respect to xis a product of two rates of change: 1. the rate of change of ywith respect to its immediate input u, and 2. the rate of change of uwith respect to its input, x. Why does it work this way? Although the derivative is not a simple quotient, we gain an intuitive grasp of the chain rule by writing dy dx\u0019Dy Dx=Dy DuDu Dx then it is apparent that the \"cancellation\" of terms Duin numerator and denominator lead to the correct fraction on the left. The proof of the chain rule uses this essential idea, but care is taken to ensure that the quantity Duis nonzero, to avoid the embarrassment of dealing with the nonsensical ratio 0 /0. The proof of the chain rule is found in Appendix E.4.IN TRODU CIN G THE C HAI N RULE 169 Example 8.3 Compute the derivative of the function h (x) =5(x3\u0000x2)10. Solution. We express the function as y=h(x) =5u10where u= (x3\u0000x2) and apply du\u0013\u0012d(x3\u0000x2) dx\u0013 =50u9(3x2\u00002x). Substituting for uleads to Compute the derivative of the function y=f(x) =p x2+a2, where a is some positive real number. /facetime_videoA quick summary of the rst and second derivatives of the function in Example 8.4 for the case a=1.Solution. This function can be considered as the composition of g(u) =pu= u1/2andu(x) =x2+a2, that is, we can write f(x) =g(h(x)). Then using the chain rule, we obtain dy dx=1 2\u0001(x2+d2)\u00001/2\u00012x=x (x2+d2)1/2=xp x2+d2. \u0006 Example 8.5 Compute the derivative of the function y=f(x) =xp x2+d2, where d is some positive real number. Solution. We use both the quotient rule and the chain rule for this calcula- tion. dy dx=[x]0\u0001p x2+d2\u0000[p x2+d2]0\u0001x x2+d2\u0000[1 2\u00012x\u0001(x2+d2)\u00001/2]\u0001x (x2+d2). We simplify algebraically by multiplying top and bottom by (x2+d2)1/2and cancelling factors of 2 to obtain dy dx=x2+d2\u0000x2 (x2+d2)1/2(x2+d2)=d2 (x2+d2)3/2. \u0006 Interpreting the chain rule While the chain rule is not rigorously proved here (see Appendix E.4), we hope to extend our intuition about where it comes from. The following intuitive examples may help to motivate why the chain rule is based on a product of two rates of change.170 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example 8.6 (Pollution level in a lake) A species of sh is sensitive to pollutants in a lake. As humans populate the area around the lake, the sh population declines due to increased pollution levels. Quantify the rate at which the pollution level changes with time based on the pollution produced per human and the rate of increase of the human population. Solution. The rate of change (decline in this case) of the sh population depends on: the rate of change of the human population, and the rate of change in the pollution created per person. If either increases, the effect on the sh population increases. The chain rule implies that the net effect is a product of the two rates. Formally, for ttime in years, x=f(t)the number of people at the lake in year t, and p=g(x)the pollution created by xpeople, the rate of change of the pollution pover time is a product of g0(x)andf0(t): d p dt=d p dxdx dt=g0(x)f0(t). \u0006Mastered Material Check 4. If pollution is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3), give units for p andd p/dt. Example 8.7 (Population of carnivores, prey, and vegetation) The pop- ulation of large carnivores, C, on the African savannah depends on the population of gazelles that are their prey, P. The gazelle population, in turn, depends on the abundance of vegetation V, which depends on the amount of rain in a given year, r. Quantify the rate of change of the carnivore popula- tion with respect to rainfall. Solution. We can express these dependencies through hypothetical functions such as V=g(r),P=f(V)andC=h(P), each depicting a relationship in the food chain. A drought that decreases rainfall also decreases the abundance of vege- tation. This then decreases the gazelle population, and eventually affect the population of carnivores. The rate of change in the carnivores population with respect to the rainfall, dC/dr, according to the chain rule, would be dC dr=dC dP\u0001dP dV\u0001dV dr. \u0006 Example 8.8 (Population of carnivores) Consider Example 8.7, with the specic example of the relationships of carnivores and prey, C=h(P) =P2, prey on vegetation, P=f(V) V=g(r) = r1/2(Figure 8.2). Quantify the rate of change of the carnivore population with respect to rainfall.IN TRODU CIN G THE C HAI N RULE 171 PC VP rV Figure 8.2: An example in which the population of carnivores, depends on prey Pacording to C=h(P) =P2, while the prey depend on vegetation, =2V, and the vegetation depends on necessary derivatives, dV dr=1 2r\u00001/2,dP dV=2,dC dP=2P, so that, from Example 8.7, the rate of change in the carnivores with respect to the rainfall is dC dr=dC dPdP dVdV dr=1 2r\u00001/2(2)(2P) =2P dC dr=2P V=2(2V) V=4. \u0006Mastered Material Check 5. Take an alternative approach to Example 8.8 by expressing the number of carnivores Cexplicitly in terms of rainfall r, and then differentiating. Verify that both approaches yield the same solution. 6. While both approaches work in this case, why might they not in general?Example 8.9 (Budget for coffee) Your budget for coffee depends on the number of cups consumed per day and on the price per cup. The total budget changes if either price or the consumption goes up. Dene appropriate variables and quantify the rate at which the coffee budget changes if both consumption and price change. Solution. The total rate of change of the coffee budget is a product of the change in the price and the change in the consumption. For ttime in days, x=f(t)the number of cups of coffee consumed, and y=g(x)the price for x cups of coffee, we obtain dy dt=dy dxdx dt=g0(x)f0(t). \u0006 Example 8.10 (Earth's temperature and greenhouse gases) In Exercise 21 of Chapter 1, we found that the temperature of the Earth depends on the albedo a(fraction of incoming radiation energy reflected) according to the T=\u0012(1\u0000a)S es\u00131/4 .

Temperature Tdepends on the level of greenhouse gases Gthrough the albedo a, so we write T(a(G)).

We generalize our results in Exercise 3. \u0006 8.2 The chain rule applied to optimization problems Section 8.2 Learning goals 1. Read and interpret the derivation of each optimization model. 2.Carry out the calculations of derivatives appearing in the problems (using the chain rule). 3. Using optimization, nd each critical point and identify its type. 4. Explain the interpretation of the mathematical results. Armed with the chain rule, we can now differentiate a wider variety of functions, and address problems that were not tractable with the power, product, or quotient rules alone. We return to optimization problems where derivatives require use of the chain rule.IN TRODU CIN G THE C HAI N RULE 173 Shortest path from food to nest Ants are good mathematicians! They can nd the shortest route connecting their nest to a food source. But how do they do it? Each ant secretes a chemical pheromone that other ants tend to follow. This marks up the trail that they use and recruits nest-mates to food sources. The pheromone (chemical message for marking a route) evaporates after a while, so that, for a xed given number of foraging ants, a longer trail has a less concentrated chemical marking than a shorter trail. This means that whenever a shorter route is found, the ants favour it. After some time, this leads to selection of the shortest possible trail. Shown in Figure 8.3 is a common laboratory test scenario: ants in an articial nest are offered two equivalent food sources. We ask: what is the shortest total path connecting nest and sources? This is a simplied version of the problem that the ants are solving. Example 8.11 (Minimizing the total path length) Use the diagram to determine the length of the shortest path that connects the nest to both food sources. Assume that d <<D. Solution. We rst consider two possibile paths connecting nest to food: 1. a V-shaped path and 2. a T-shaped path. The length of a V-shaped path is 2p D2+d2, whereas the length of a T- shaped path is D+2d. Mastered Material Check 9. If D=2m and d=20cm, how long is the V-shaped path? The T-shaped path?Now consider a third possibility: a Y-shaped path, where the ants rst walk straight ahead and then veer off to the left and right. All three possibili- ties are shown in Figure 8.3.

Thus, 0\u0014x\u0014Dis the appropriate domain, and we have determined the values of Lat the two domain endpoints. To nd the minimal path length, we look for critical points of the function L(x).

For D=2m and d=20cm, what is the shortest path length for the ants? To determine the actual length of the path, we substitute x=d/p 3into the function L(x)and obtain (after simplication, see Exercise 4) L=L(x) =D+p 3d. The nal result is summarized in Figure 8.4. The shortest path is Y-shaped, with x=d/p 3. The ants march straight for a distance D\u0000(d/p 3), and then their trail branches to the right and left towards the food sources.

What is the most economical way to cut the beam so as to waste the least amount of material?IN TRODU CIN G THE C HAI N RULE 175 Food choice and attention The following example is based on research about animal behaviour. As before, we consider how animals should spend their time, but now a choice is provided between two types of food. Paying attention. Many types of food are cryptic - hidden in the environ- ment - and so, require time and attention to nd. Some types of food are more easily detected, but other foods might provide greater nourishment. Behavioural ecologist Reuven Dukas (McMaster U) studied how blue jays allocate attention to two food types [Dukas and Ellner, 1993, Dukas and Kamil, 2000, 2001]. The goal in the following problem is to nd the optimal subdivision of time and attention between the food types so as to maximizes the total energy gain. Setting up the model. Suppose that there are twoavailable food types. Dene notation as follows: x = attention devoted to nding food of type 1 P(x)= probability of nding the food given attention xMastered Material Check 11. If x=1 and full attention is devoted to nding food type 1, is any attention devoted to nding food type 2? 12. If x=0.5, how much attention is being paid to nding food of type 1? We assume that 0\u0014x\u00141, with x=0representing no attention and x=1 meaning full attention is devoted to nding food type 1. Moreover, Pis a probability which mean 0\u0014P\u00141. We assume that P(0) =0which means that when no attention is paid ( x=0) the probability of nding food is zero ( P=0). We also assume for simplicity that P(1) =1, so when full attention paid x=1, there is always success ( P=1).Mastered Material Check 13. Use Figure 8.6 to estimate the attention xneeded to have a 50% probability of nding food type 1. That is, roughly estimate xsuch thatP(x) =0.5 for each of the probability curves. 14. If we fully divide attention between food types 1 and 2, and we spend 0.25 of our attention on nding food type 1, how much attention is given to food type 2? Converting the probability to a percentage may help with understandingFigure 8.6 displays hypothetical examples of P(x). The horizontal axis is attention 0\u0014x\u00141, and the vertical axis, is the probability of success, 0\u0014P\u00141. All these curves share the assumed properties of full success with full attention, and no success with no attention. However, the curves differ in overall shape. Questions. 1. What is the difference between foods of type 1 and 4? 2. Which food is easier to nd, type 3 or type 4? 3.Compare the above to the case that P(x) =xand explain what this new case implies. 4.

We show possible curves for four types of foods, some easier to nd than others.Observe that concave down curves such as 3 and 4 rise rapidly at small x, indicating that the probability of nding food increases a lot just by increas- ing the attention by a little: these represent foods that are relatively easy to nd. Other curves (1 and 2) are concave up, indicting that much more atten- tion is needed to gain appreciable increase in the probability of success: these represent foods that are harder to nd. The concavity of the curves carries176 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES this important information about the relative ease or difculty of nding a given food type. Letxandydenote the attention divided between food types 1 and 2, and suppose that type 2 is N-times more nutritious than type 1.

(These functions satisfy P(0) =0,P(1) =1, in accordance with Figure 8.6.) Further, suppose that both foods are equally nutritious, so N=1. Find the optimal V (x). Solution. The total nutritional value in this case is V(x) =P1(x) +N P 2(1\u0000x) =x2+ (1\u0000x)3. We look for a maximum value of V.

Unfortunately, this problem, turns out to be algebraically nasty. However, we can look for an approximate solution to the problem, using Newton's Method. A plotting the graph of V(x)in Figure 8.8 demonstrates that there is a maximum inside the interval 0\u0014x\u00141, i.e., for attention split between nding both foods.

Example 8.14 Use Newton's Method to nd the critical point for the func- tion V (x)in Example 8.13. Solution. Finding the critical point of V(x)reduces to solving V0(x) =0. Letf(x) =V0(x)- we must solve f(x) =0using Newton's Method (Recall Section 5.4). Since the interval of interest is 0\u0014x\u00141, we start with an initial \"guess\" for the critical point at x0=0.5, midway along this interval. Then, according to Newton's method, the improved guess would be x1=x0\u0000f(x0) f0(x0). and, repeating this, at the k'th stage, xk+1=xk\u0000f(xk) f0(xk). To use this method, 2x1/2\u00001 3(1.0\u0000x)(2/3),178 =V00(x) =\u00001 4x(3/2)\u00002 9(1.0\u0000x)(5/3). Thus, we might use a spreadsheet in which cells A1 stores our initial guess, whereas B1, C1, and D1 store the values of f(x),f0(x)andx0\u0000f(x0)/f0(x0). In the typical syntax of spreadsheets, this might read something like the following: /_462Link to Google Sheets. This spreadsheet implements Newton's method for Example 8.14.

We see that the values converge to the location of the critical point, x=0.61977 (and y=1\u0000x=0.38022 ) within the interval of interest. Epilogue. While the conclusions drawn above were disappointing in one specic case, it is not always true that concentrating all one's attention on one type is optimal. We can examine the problem in more generality to nd when the opposite conclusion might be satised. In general, the value gained is V(x) =P1(x) +N P 2(1\u0000x). A critical point Check 19. Can you see where the (\u00001)comes from in V0(x)? Suppose we have found a value of xin0<x<1where this is satised. We then examine the function Vis thus related to the concavity of the two functions P1(x)andP2(1\u0000x). If these are concave down (e.g. as in food types 3 or 4 in Figure 8.6), then V00(x)<0and a local maximum occurs at any critical point found by our differentiation. Another way of stating this observation is: if both food types are relatively easy to nd, one can gain most benet by splitting up the attention between the two. Otherwise, if both are hard to nd, then it is best to look for only one at a time.IN TRODU CIN G THE C HAI N RULE 179 8.3 Summary 1.In this chapter we reviewed function composition, in which one func- tion acts as the input to another function.

Both kinds of seeds are hidden among litter on the forest floor and have to be found. If the bird splits its attention into x1(a fraction of 1 - its whole attention) searching for seed type 1andx2(also a fraction of1) searching for seed type 2, then its probability of nding 100 seeds of the given type is P1(x1) = ( x1)3,P2(x2) = ( x2)5.

At the instant that r=1 cm, dV dt=4pk. Importantly, the numerical value r=1cm holds only at one instant and is used at the end of the calculation, after the differentiation and simplication steps are completed. \u0006 Featured Problem 9.1 (Growth of a cell) The mass of a cell is m=rV where Vis cell volume and ris cell density.

Describe implicit differentiation geometrically. 3.Compute the slope of a curve at a given point using implicit differentiation, nd tangent line equations, and solve problems based on such ideas.188 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Implicit and explicit denition of a function A review of the denition of a function (e.g. Appendix C) reminds us that for a given xvalue, only one yvalue is permitted. For example, for y=x2 any value of xleads to a single yvalue (Figure 9.7a). Geometrically, this means that the graph of this function satises the vertical line property : a given xvalue can have at most one corresponding yvalue. Not all curves satisfy this property. The elliptical curve in Figure 9.7b clearly fails this, intersecting some vertical lines twice. This simply means that, while we can write down an equation for such a curve, e.g. (x\u00001)2 4+ (y\u00001)2=1, we cannot solve for a simple function that describes the entire curve. Never- theless, the idea of a tangent line to such a curve - and consequently the slope of such a tangent line - is perfectly reasonable. In order to make sense of this idea, we restrict attention to a local part of the curve, close to some point of interest (Figure 9.7c). Then near this point , the equation of the curve denes an implicit function , that is, close enough to the point of interest, a value of xleads to a unique value of y. We refer to this value as y(x)to remind us of the relationship between the two variables. xy xy xy xy xy(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 9.7: (a) A function has to satisfy the vertical line property. Hence, the curve shown in (b) cannot be a function. We can write down an equation for the curve, but we cannot solve for yexplicitly. (c) However, close to a given point on the curve (dark point), we can think of how changing the x coordinate of the point (shaded interval on x axis) leads to a change in the corresponding ycoordinate on the same curve (shaded interval on yaxis). (d) We can also ask what is the slope of the curve at the given point. This corresponds to limDx!0Dy/Dx. Implicit differentiation can be used to compute that derivative. How can we generalize the notion of a derivative to implicit functions? We observe from (Figure 9.7d) that a small change in xleads to a small change in y. Without writing down an explicit expression for yversus x, weCH AIN RULE APPLI ED TO RELATED RATES AND IM PLI CIT D IFFEREN TIATIO N 189 can still determine these small changes, and form a ratio Dy/Dxwhich is a (secant line) slope.

What does this say about the bottom part of the circle?Note: we can see from the last expression that the second derivative is negative for y>0, i.e. for the top semi-circle, indicating that this part of the curve is concave down (as expected). Indeed, as in the case of simple functions, the second derivative can help identify concavity of curves.

The highest point on the ellipse has a horizontal tangent line, so we should look for the points on this curve at which dy/dx=0. 1.Finding the slope of the tangent line: d dx[x2+3y2\u0000xy] =d dx1)d(x2) dx+d(3y2) dx\u0000d(xy) dx=0. We must use the product rule to compute the derivative of the last y=2xat the point of interest. Next, we nd the coordinates of the point. 2.Determining the coordinates of the point we want: We look for a point that satises the equation of the curve as well as the condition y=2x.

After simplifying, this equation becomes 11x2=1, leading to the two possibilities x=\u00061p 11,y=\u00062p 11. Which of these two points is at the top?

In Exam- ple 9.9, we nd the point at the top of the ellipse using implicit differentiation.3.Identifying the point at the top: The top point on the ellipse is located at a point where the curve is concave down. Concavity can be determined using the second derivative, computed (from the rst derivative) using the quotient rule: y00=[y\u00002x]0(6y\u0000x)\u0000[6y\u0000x]0(y\u00002x) (6y\u0000x)2 =[y0\u00002](6y\u0000x)\u0000[6y0\u00001](y\u00002x) (6y\u0000x)2. 4.Plugging in information about the point: Now that we have set down the form of this derivative, we make some important observations about the specic point of interest. (This is done as a nal step, only after all derivatives have been calculated) We are only concerned with the sign of the second derivative. The denom- inator is always positive (since it is squared) and so does not affect the sign. At the top of ellipse, y0=0, simplifying some of the terms above. At the top of ellipse, y=2xso the term (y\u00002x) =0. Mastered Material Check 16. Verify by hand that x=\u00061p 11are two possible solutions to Example 9.9. 17. Repeat Example 9.9 looking for the lowest point on the rotated ellipse.We can thus simplify the expression for the y00to obtain y00(x) =[\u00002](6y\u0000x)\u0000[\u0000x](0) (6y\u0000x)2=[\u00002](6y\u0000x) (6y\u0000x)2=\u00002 (6y\u0000x). Using the the nal form y00(x) =\u00002 (6(2x)\u0000x)=\u00002 11x. Consequently, the second derivative is negative (implying concave down curve) whenever xis positive. This tells us that at the point with positive x value ( x=1/p 11), we are at the top of the ellipse.

We use the term \"related rates\" to describe such problems. 2.Curves that fail the vertical line property cannot be describe by a single function y=f(x), even if we can represent some of those curves by equation(s). 3.Zooming in on such a curve, we can dene an implicit function that describes some local piece of the curve. 4.When we use implicit differentiation in two variables, we treat one vari- able as independent and the other as dependent. This allows us to differen- tiate the equation with respect to the independent variable using the chain rule. 5.Through implicit differentiation we showed that the derivative of y=xm/n isdy dx=m nx(m n\u00001). 6.

A single cell of the bacterium E. coli would, under ideal circumstances, divide every twenty minutes. That is not particularly disturbing until you think about it, but the fact is that bacteria multiply geometrically: one becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so on. In this way it can be shown that in a single day, one cell of E. coli could produce a super-colony equal in size and weight to the entire planet Earth.\" Michael Crichton, The Andromeda Strain, p. 247 [Crichton, 1969] In this chapter, we introduce the exponential functions. We rst describe the discrete process of population doubling , represented by powers of 2, namely, 2n, where nis some integer. We generalize to a continuous function 2xwhere xis any real number. We can then attach meaning to the notion of the derivative of an exponential function. In doing so, we encounter a specially convenient base denote e, leading to the most useful member of this class of functions, y=ex.

With this preparation, we can now check the accuracy of Crichton's statement about bacterial growth.Mastered Material Check 4. Why would the approximation 210\u0019103be helpful? Example 10.1 (Growth of E. coli) Use the following facts to check the assertion made by Crichton's statement at the beginning of this chapter.

How many cells of E. coli would there be after 20 minutes? 1 hour? 2 hours?Solution. Based on the above two facts, we surmise that the size of an E. coli colony (number of cells, m) that together form a mass equal to Planet Earth would be m=6\u00011024kg 10\u000015kg=6\u00011039.EXPO NENTIA L FUNC TIONS 205 Each hour corresponds to 3twenty-minute generations. In a period of 24 hours, there are 24\u00023=72generations, each doubling the colony size. After 1day of uncontrolled growth, the number of cells would be 272.We can nd a decimal approximation using the observation that 210\u0019103: 272=22\u0001270=4\u0001(210)7\u00194\u0001(103)7=4\u00011021. Using a scientic calculator, the value is found to be 4.7\u00011021, so the approxi- mation is relatively good. \u0006 Apparently, the estimate made by Crichton is not quite accurate. However it can be shown that it takes less than 2 days to produce a number far in excess of the \"size of Planet Earth\".

Ea>0is constant for the given substance. The fraction of bimolecular reactions in which this collision energy is achieved is F=e\u0000(Ea/RT), where Tis temperature (in degrees Kelvin) and R>0is the gas constant. Suppose that the temperature Tincreases at some constant rate, C, per unit time. Determine the rate of change of the fraction Fof collisions that result in a successful reaction. Solution. This is a related rates problem involving an exponential function that depends on the temperature, which depends on time, F=e\u0000(Ea/RT(t)). We are asked to nd the derivative of Fwith respect to time when the tempera- ture increases. We are given that dT/dt=C. Let u=\u0000Ea/RT. F=eu.

Compute the derivative dy/dx and interpret its meaning. (c)What population level this year would result in the greatest possible population next year? The function exsatises a new kind of equation We divert our attention momentarily to an interesting observation. We have seen that the function y=f(x) =ex satises the relationship dy dx=f0(x) =f(x) =y. In other words, when differentiating, we get the same function back again. We summarize this observation: The function y=f(x) =exis equal to its own derivative. It hence satises the equation dy dx=y. An equation linking a function and its derivative(s) is called a differential equation . This is a new type of equation, unlike others previously seen in this course. In Chapters 11-13 we show that these differential equations have many applications to biology, physics, chemistry, and science in general. 10.3 Inverse functions and logarithms Section 10.3 Learning goals 1.Explain the concept of inverse function from both algebraic and geometric points of view: given a function, determine whether (and for what re- stricted domain) an inverse function can be dened and sketch that inverse function. 2.Describe the relationship between the domain and range of a function and the range and domain of its inverse function. (Review Appendix C.5). 3.Apply these ideas to the logarithm, which is the inverse of an exponential function. 4.Reproduce the calculation of the derivative of ln(x)using implicit differen- tiation. In this chapter we dened the new function exand computed its derivative. Paired with this newcomer is an inverse function, the natural logarithm, ln(x). Recall the following key ideas:212 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Given a function y=f(x), its inverse function, denoted f\u00001(x)satises f(f\u00001(x)) = x, and f\u00001(f(x)) = x. The range of f(x)is the domain of f\u00001(x)(and vice versa), which implies that in many cases, the relationship holds only on some subset of the original domains of the functions. The functions f(x) =xnandg(x) =x1/nare inverses of one another for all Material Check 19. Are f(x) =xnandg(x) =x1/nalso inverses of one another for even integer n? Is this true for all x? 20. What is the inverse function for y=x? Over what range of values is the inverse dened? 21. What is the inverse function to y=x2/3and over what domain are the two functions inverses of one another? /_481Note symmetry about the line y=x for this graph of f(x) =xnand g(x) =x1/n. Adjust the slider for nto see how even and odd powers behave. What do you notice about the domain over which g(x)is dened? Adjust the slider for ato observe \"corresponding points\" on the two graphs.The domain of a function (such as y=x2or other even powers) must be restricted (e.g. to x\u00150) so that its inverse function ( y=px) is dened. On that restricted domain, the graphs of fandf\u00001are mirror images of one another about the line y=x. Essentially, this stems from the fact that the roles of xandyare interchanged. The natural logarithm is an inverse function for ex Fory=f(x) =exwe dene an inverse function, shown on Figure 10.6. We call this function the logarithm (base e), and write it as y=f\u00001(x) =ln(x). 4 2 2 4 4224ex y=xln(x) xy Figure 10.6: The function y=exis shown inverse, y=lnx.We have the following connection: y=eximplies x=ln(y). The fact that the functions are inverses also implies that eln(x)=xand ln (ex) =x. The domain of exis\u0000\u00a5<x<\u00a5, and its range is x>0. For the inverse function, this domain and range are interchanged, meaning that ln(x)is only dened for x>0(its domain) and returns values in \u0000\u00a5<x<\u00a5(its range). As shown in Figure 10.6, the functions exandln(x)are reflections of one another about the line y=x. Properties of the logarithm stem directly from properties of the exponen- tial function. A review of these is provided in Appendix B.2. Briefly, Mastered Material Check 22.

A tree can provide advantage to nearby plants by creating better soil permeability, higher water retention, and more stableEXPO NENTIA L FUNC TIONS 213 temperatures. At the same time, trees produce shade and increased competi- tion for nutrients. Both the advantage A(x)and the shading S(x)depend on distance from the tree, with shading a dominant negative effect right under the tree. Suppose that at a distance xfrom a given tree species, the net benet B to a crop plant can be expressed as the difference Figure 10.7: Too close to a tree, shading (grey) S(x)interferes with crop growth. Just beyond this region, the advantage A(x)to crop growth outweighs any disadvantage due to shading.

(b) Find the optimal distance to plan crops so that they derive maximal benet from the nearby tree. Derivative of ln(x)by implicit differentiation Implicit differentiation is helpful whenever an inverse function appears. Knowing the derivative of the original function allows us to compute the derivative of its inverse by using their relationship. We use implicit differenti- ation to nd the derivative of y=ln(x). First, restate the relationship in the inverse form, but consider yas the dependent variable - that is think of yas a quantity that depends on x: y=ln(x)) ey=x)d dxey(x)=d dxx.

Adjust the slider to see the tangent lines at various points along the curves. What do we mean by \"corresponding points\"? the role of independent and dependent variables are switched.

Using the logarithm for base conversion The logarithm is helpful in changing an exponential function from one base to another. We give some examples here. Mastered Material Check 23. Why might one base be preferred over another? Example 10.9 Rewrite y =2xin terms of base e. Solution. We apply lnand then exponentiate the result. Manipulations of exponents and logarithms lead to the desired results =0.6931 :::This coincides with the value we computed earlier for C2in Example 10.4, so we have y=ekxwhere k=ln(2) =0.6931 ::: \u0006 Example 10.10 Find the derivative of y =2x. Solution. In Example 10.9 we expressed this function in the alternate form y=2x=ekxwith k=ln(2). From Example 10.7 we have dy dx=kekx=ln(2)eln(2)x=ln(2)2x. Through the above base conversion and chain rule, we relate the constant C2 in Example 10.4 to the natural logarithm of 2: C2=ln(2).\u0006EXPO NENTIA L FUNC TIONS 215 The logarithm helps to solve exponential equations Equations involving the exponential function can sometimes be simplied and solved using the logarithm. We provide a few examples of this kind. Example 10.11 Find zeros of the function y =f(x) =e2x\u0000e5x2. Solution. We seek values of We write e2x\u0000e5x2=0) e2x=e5x2)e5x2 e2x=1) e5x2\u00002x=1. Taking logarithm of both sides, and using the facts that ln(e5x2\u00002x) =5x2\u00002x and ln (1) =0, we obtain e5x2\u00002x=1) 5x2\u00002x=0) x=0,2 5. We see that the logarithm is useful in the last step of isolating x, after simpli- fying the exponential expressions appearing in the equation. \u0006 Andromeda Strain, revisited. In Section 10.1 we posed the question: how long does it take for the Andromeda strain population to attain a size of 6\u00011039 cells, i.e. to grow to an Earth-sized colony? We now solve this problem using the continuous exponential function and the logarithm. Recall that the bacterial doubling time is 20min. If time is measured in minutes, the number, B(t)of bacteria at time tcould be described by the smooth function: B(t) =2t/20.Mastered Material Check 24. Verify that B(t)agrees with Figure 10.1 and give powers of 2 att=20,40,60,80, :::minutes. 25. When, in general, will B(t)give a power of 2? Example 10.12 (The Andromeda strain) Starting from a single cell, how long does it take for an E. coli colony to reach size of 6\u00011039cells by doubling every 20 minutes? Solution. We compute the time it takes by solving for tinB(t) =6\u00011039, =2643.27 60hr. Hence, it takes 44 hours (but less than 2 days) for the colony to \"grow to the size of planet Earth\" (assuming the implausible scenario of unlimited growth). \u0006216 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example 10.13 (Using base e)Express the number of bacteria in terms of base e (for practice with base conversions). Solution. Given B(t) =2t/20is the number of bacteria at time units of 1/time. We refer to kas the growth rate of the bacteria. We observe that this constant can be written as: k=ln(2) doubling time. As we see next, this approach is helpful in scientic applications. Logarithms help plot data that varies on large scale Living organisms come in a variety of sizes, from the tiniest cells to the largest whales. Comparing attributes across species of vastly different sizes poses a challenge, as visualizing such data on a simple graph obscures both extremes. Suppose we wish to compare the physiology of organisms of various sizes, from that of a mouse to that of an elephant. An example of such data for metabolic rate versus mass of the animal is shown in Table 10.4.basal animal body weight metabolic M(gm) rate (BMR) mouse 25 1580 rat 226 873 rabbit 2200 466 dog 11700 318 man 70000 202 horse 700000 106 Table 10.4: Animals of various sizes (mass Min gm) have widely different basal metabolic rates (BMR, generally measured in terms of oxygen consumption rate, i.e. ml O2consumed per hr). A log-log plot of this data is shown in Figure 10.8.It would be hard to see all data points clearly on a regular graph. For this reason, it is helpful to use logarithmic scaling for either or both vari- ables. We show an example of this kind of log-log plot , where both axes use logarithmic scales, in Figure 10.8. In allometry, it is conjectured that such data ts some power function of the form y\u0019axb, where a,b>0.

Example 10.15 (Finding the constants) Use the straight line superimposed on the data in Figure 10.8 to estimate the values of the constants a and b. Solution. We use the straight line that has been tted to the data in Fig- ure 10.8. The Yintercept is roughly 8.2. The line goes approximately through (20,3)and(0,8.2)(open dots on plot) so its slope is \u0019(3\u0000 8.2)/20=\u00000.26. According to the relationship we found in Example 10.14, 8.2=A=ln(a)) a=e8.2=3640, and b=\u00000.26. Thus, reverting to the original allometric relationship leads to y=axb=3640 x\u00000.26=3640 x0.26. From this we see that the metabolic rate ydecreases with the size xof the animal, as indicated by the data in Table 10.4. 10.5 Summary 1.We reviewed exponential functions of the form y=ax, where a>0, the base, is constant. 2.The function y=exis its own derivative, that isdy dx=ex. This function satisesdy dx=y, which is an example of a differential equation . 3.Ify=f(x), its inverse function is denoted f\u00001(x)and satises f(f\u00001(x)) = xandf\u00001(f(x)) = x. The graph of f\u00001is the same as the graph of fre- flected across the line y=x. The domain of a function may have to be restricted so that its inverse function exists. 4.Letf(x) =ex. The inverse of this function is f\u00001(x) =ln(x). The derivative of ln (x)is1 x. 5.We can transform exponential relationships into linear relationships using logarithms. Such transformations allow for more meaningful plots, and can aid us in nding unknown constants in exponential relationships. 6.

Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was invented by Mullis in 1983 to amplify DNA. It is based on the fact that each strand of (double-stranded) DNA can act as a template for the synthesis of the second (\"complementary\") strand. The method consists of repeated cycles of heating (which separates the DNA strands) and cooling (allowing for new DNA to be assembled on each strand). The reaction mixture includes the original DNA to be amplied, plus enzymes and nucleotides, the components needed to form the new DNA). Each cycle doubles the amount of DNA. A particular PCR experiment consisted of 35 cycles. (a)By what factor was the original DNA amplied? Give your answer both in terms of powers of 2and in approximate decimal (powers of ten) notations. (b)Use the approximation in the caption of Table 10.1 (rather than a scientic calculator) to nd the decimal approximation. 10.2. Invention of the game of chess. According to some legends, the inventor of the game of chess (who lived in India thousands of years ago) so pleased his ruler, that he was asked to chose his reward. \"I would be content with grains of wheat. Let one grain be placed on the rst square of my chess board, and double that number on the second, double that on the third, and so on, \" said the inventor. The ruler gladly agreed. A chessboard has 8\u00028squares. How many grains of wheat would be required for the last square on that board? Give your answer in decimal notation. Note: in the original wheat and chessboard problem, we are asked to nd the total number of wheat grains on all squares. This requires summing a geometric series, and is a problem ideal for early 2nd term calculus. 10.3.

This means P(t) =Cert, where r>0. We investigate this claim. To this end, we consider the human popula- tion beginning in year 1800 ( t=0). Hence, we ask whether the data in Table 10.5 ts the relationship P(t) =Cer(t\u00001800), where tis time in years and r>0?year human population (billions) 1 0.2 1000 0.275 1500 0.45 1650 0.5 1750 0.7 1804 1 1850 1.2 1900 1.6 1927 2 1950 2.55 1960 3 1980 4.5 1987 5 1999 6 2011 7 2020 7.7 Table 10.5: The human population (billions) over the years AD 1 to AD 2020.(a)Show that the above relationship implies that ln(P)is a linear function of time, and that ris the slope of the linear relationship (hint: take the natural logarithm of both sides of the relationship and simplify).

The data in Table 10.6 is claimed to have been What is exponential peeling? generated by a double exponential function of the form N(t) =C1e\u0000r1t+C2e\u0000r2t,t\u00150. Use the data to determine the values of Exercise 20; data to be t to a function of the form N(t) = C1e\u0000r1t+C2e\u0000r2t,t\u00150.10.21. Shannon Entropy. In a recent application of information theory to the eld of genomics, a function called the Shannon entropy, H, was considered. In it, a given gene is represented as a binary device: it can be either \"on\" or \"off\" (i.e. being expressed or not). Ifxis the probability that the gene is \"on\" and yis the probability that it is \"off\", the Shannon entropy function for the gene is dened as H=\u0000xlog(x)\u0000ylog(y) Note that xandybeing probabilities just means that they satisfy 0<x\u00141, and 0<y\u00141 and the gene can only be in one of these two states, so x+y=1. Use these facts to show that the Shannon entropy for the gene is greatest when the two states are equally probable, i.e. for x=y=0.5. 10.22. A threshold function. The response of a regulatory gene to inputs that affect it is not simply linear. Often, the following so-called \"squashing function\" or \"threshold function\" is used to link the input x to the output yof the gene: y=f(x) =1 1+e(ax+b), where a,bare <y<1.

Note: The second derivative is not very informative here, and we do not ask you to use it for determining concavity in this example. However, you may wish to calculate it for practice with the chain rule. 10.25. The Ricker Equation. In studying salmon populations, a model often used is the Ricker equation which relates the size of a sh population this year, xto the expected size next year y. The Ricker equation is y=axe\u0000bx where a,b>0. (a)Find the value of the current population which maximizes the salmon population next year according to this model. (b)Find the value of the current population which would be exactly maintained in the next generation. (c) Explain why a very large population is not sustainable. Note: these populations do not actually change continuously, since all the parents die before the eggs are hatched. 10.26. Spacing in a sh school. Life in a social group has advantages and disadvantages: protection from predators is one advantage. Dis- advantages include competition for food or resources. Spacing of individuals in a school of sh or a flock of birds is determined by the mutual attraction and repulsion of neighbours from one another: each individual does not want to stray too far from others, nor get too close. Suppose that when two sh are at distance x>0from one another, they are attracted with \"force\" to the magnitudes of the forces, while a,rto the spatial range of these effects.

The density of seeds at a distance xfrom a parent tree is observed to be D(x) =D0e\u0000x2/a2, where a>0,D0>0are positive constants. Insects that eat these seeds tend to congregate near the tree so that the fraction of seeds that get eaten is F(x) =e\u0000x2/b2 where b>0. Note: These functions are called Gaussian or Normal distributions. The parameters a,bare related to the \"width\" of these bell-shaped curves. The number of seeds that survive (i.e. are produced and not eaten by insects) is S(x) =D(x)(1\u0000F(x)) Determine the distance xfrom the tree at which the greatest number of seeds survive. 10.28.

Use as many terms as necessary to nd an approximate value for the number eand for 1 /eto 5 decimal places. Note: in other mathematics courses we see that such expansions, called power series, are central to approximations of many functions.11 Differential equations for exponential growth and decay In Section 10.2 we made an observation about exponential functions and a new kind of equation - a differential equation - that such functions satisfy. In this chapter we explore this observation in more detail. At rst, this link is based on the simple relationship between an exponential function and its derivatives. Later, this expands into a more encompassing discussion of 1. how differential equations arise in scientic problems, 2. how we study their predictions, and 3. what their solutions can tell us about the natural world. We begin by reintroducing these equations. 11.1 Introducing a new kind of equation /facetime_videoA screencast summary of the introduction: differential equations for exponential growth and decay. Edu.Cr.Section 11.1 Learning goals 1.Explain that the exponential function and its derivative are proportional to one another, and thereby satisfy a relationship of the form dy/dx=ky. 2.Give the denitions of a differential equation and of a solution to a differ- ential equation. 3. Explain that y=ektis a solution to the differential equation dy/dt=ky. Observations about the exponential function In Chapter 10, we introduced the exponential function y=f(x) =ex,and noted that it satises the relationship dex dx=ex,)dy dx=y. The equation on the right (linking a function to its own derivative) is a new kind of equation called a differential equation (abbreviated DE). We say that228 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES f(x) =exis a function that \"satises\" the equation, and we call this a solution to the differential equation . Note: The solution to an algebraic equation is a number, whereas the solution to a differential equation is a function. We call this a differential equation because it connects (one or more) derivatives of a function with the function itself. Mastered Material Check 1. For whar constant Cdoes y=Cex satisfy the differential equation dy/dx=y? 2. What function satises the DE dy/dz=y?Denition 11.1 (Differential equation) A differential equation is a mathe- matical equation that relates one or more derivatives of some function to the function itself. Solving the differential equation is the process of identifying the function(s) that satises the given relationship. We will be interested in applications in which a system or process varies over time. For this reason, we will henceforth use the independent variable t, fortime in place of the former generic \" x\". Observations. 1.Consider the function of time: y=f(t) =et.Show that this function Hint: Notice that we merely changed the notation very slightly. Now the derivative is \"with respect to\" t rather than x.satises the differential equation dy dt=y. 2. The functions y=ekt(forkconstant) satisfy the differential equation dy dt=ky. (11.1) We can verify by differentiating y=ekt, using the chair rule. Setting u=kt, andy=eu, we have dy dt=dy dudu dt=eu\u0001k=kekt=ky)dy dt=ky Hence, we have established that y=ektsatises the DE (11.1). It is interesting to ask: Is this is the only function that satises the differential equation 11.1? Are there other possible solutions? What about a function such as y=2ektory=400ekt? The reader should show that for any constant C, the function y=Cekt is a solution to the DE (11.1) . To do so, differentiate the function and plug Hint: Notice that the constant Cin front will appear in both the derivative and the function, and so will not change the equation.into(11.1) . Verifying that the two sides of the equation are then the same establishes the result. While we do not prove it here, it turns out that y=Cekt are the only functions that satisfy Eqn. (11.1). Let us summarize what we have found out so far:DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 229 Solutions to the differential equation dy dt=ky (11.2) are the functions y=Cekt(11.3) for C an arbitrary constant. A few comments are in order. First, unlike algebraic equations - whose solutions are numbers - differential equations have solutions that are func- tions . Second, the constant kthat appears in Eqn. (11.2) , is the same as the Mastered Material Check 3. Give an example of an algebraic equation and its solution. 4. Verify that y=3e\u0000tsatises differential equationdy dt=\u0000y. 5.

Depending on the sign of k, we get either a)exponential growth fork>0, as illustrated in Figure 11.1(a), or b)exponential decay fork<0, as illustrated in Figure 11.1(b). Third, since ektis always positive, the constant Cdetermines the sign of the function as a whole - whether its graph lies above or below the taxis. A few curves of each type ( C>0,C<0) are shown in each panel of Figure 11.1. The collection of curves in a panel is called a family of solution curves. The family shares the same value of k, but each member has a distinct value of C. Next, we ask how to specify a particular member of the family as thesolution. t k >0y t k <0y (a) (b) Figure 11.1: (a) A family of solutions to the differential equation (DE) (11.2) . These are functions of the form y=Cektfork>0and arbitrary constant C. (b) Ampther family of solutions of a DE of the form (11.2) , but for k<0. The solution to a differential equation Denition 11.2 (Solution to a differential equation) By a solution to a differential equation, we mean a function that satises that equation. We often refer to \"solution curves\" - the graphs of the family of solutions of a differential equation, as shown, for example in the panels of Figure 11.1. So far, we found that \"many\" functions can be valid solutions of the differential equation (11.2) , since we can chose the constant Carbitrarily230 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES in the family of solutions y=Cekt. Hence, in order to distinguish one specic solution of interest, we need additional information. This additional information is called an initial value , orinitial condition , and it species one point belonging to the solution curve of interest. A common way to set an initial value is to specify a xed value of the function (say y=y0) at time t=0. Denition 11.3 (Initial value) Aninitial value for a differential equation is a specied, known value of the solution at some specic time point (usually at time t =0). Example 11.1 Given the differential Eqn.

We proceed as follows: y(t) by the initial condition, y(0) =y0. So, C=y0 and we have established that y(t) =y0ekt, where y0is the initial value. \u0006 For example, in Figure 11.1, the initial value species that the solution we want passes through a specic point in the ty-plane - namely, the point (0,y0). Only one curve in the family of curves has that property. Hence, the initial value picks out a unique solution. Example 11.2 Find the solution to the differential equation dy dt=\u00000.5y that satises the initial condition y(0) =3. Describe the behaviour of the solution you have found. Solution. The DE indicates that k=\u00000.5, so solutions are exponential functions y=Ce\u00000.5t. The initial condition sets the value of C. From previous discussion, we know that C=y(0) =3. Hence, the solution is y=3e\u00000.5t. This is a decaying exponential. \u0006DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 231 11.2 Differential equation for unlimited population growth Section 11.2 Learning goals 1.Recall the derivation of a model for human population growth and de- scribe how it leads to a differential equation. 2.

In this section we examine the way that a simple differential equation arises when we study continuous uncontrolled population growth. Here we set up a mathematical model for population growth. Let N(t)be the number of individuals in a population at time t. The population changes with time due to births and mortality. (Here we ignore migration). Consider the changes that take place in the population size between time tandt+h, where Dt=his a small time increment. Then Mastered Material Check 12. What is the dependent variable in this model? The independent variable? 13. What are the units associated with each variable in this model? 14. What does \" xis proportional to (11.4) is just a \"book-keeping\" equation that keeps track of people en- tering and leaving the population. It is sometimes called a balance equation . We use it to derive a differential equation linking the derivative ofNto the value ofNat the given time. Notice that dividing each term by the time interval h, we obtain N(t+h)\u0000N(t) h=\u0014Number of births h\u0015 \u0000\u0014Number of deaths h\u0015 . The term on the left \"looks familiar\". If we shrink the time interval, h!0, this term is a derivative dN/dt, so dN dt=2 4Rate of change of N per 4Number of births per unit time3 5\u00002 4Number of deaths per unit time3 5 For simplicity, we assume that all individuals are identical and that the number of births per unit time is proportional to the population size. Denote byrthe constant of proportionality. Similarly, we assume that the number of deaths per unit time is proportional to population size with mthe constant of proportionality.232 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Both randmhave meanings: ris the average per capita birth rate , and m is the average per capita mortality rate . Here, both are assumed to be xed positive constants that carry units of 1/time. This is required to make the units match for every term in Eqn. (11.4). Then r=per capita birth rate =number births per unit time population size, Mastered Material Check 15. If there are 10 births/year in a population of size 1000, what is the birth rate r? Give units. 16. If there are 11 deaths/year in a population of size 1000, what is the mortality rate m? Give units. 17. Given the above conditions, what is the net growth rate kfor such a population? Give units. Is the population growing or shrinking?m=per capita mortality rate =number deaths per unit time population size. Consequently, we have Number of births per unit time =rN, Number of deaths per unit time =mN. We refer to constants such as r,masparameters . In general, for a given population, these would have specic numerical values that could be found through experiment, by collecting data, or by making simple assumptions. In Section 11.2, we show how some elementary assumptions about birth and mortality could help to estimate approximate values of randm. Taking the assumptions and the form of the balance equation (11.4) together we have arrived at: dN dt=rN\u0000mN= (r\u0000m)N. (11.5) This is a differential equation: it links the derivative of N(t)to the func- tionN(t). By solving the equation (i.e. identifying its solution), we are be able to make a projection about how fast a population is growing. Dene the constant k=r\u0000m. Then kis the net growth rate , of the population, so dN dt=kN, for k= (r\u0000m). Suppose we also know that at time t=0, the population size is N0. Then: The function that describes population over time is (by previous results), N(t) =N0ekt=N0e(r\u0000m)t. (11.6) (The result is identical to what we saw previously, but with Nrather than y as the time-dependent function. We can easily check by differentiation that this function satises Eqn. (11.5).) Since N(t)represents a population size, it has to be non-negative to have biological relevance. This is true so long as N0\u00150. The initial condition N(0) =N0, allows us to specify the (otherwise arbitrary) constant multiplying the exponential function.DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 233 The population grows provided k>0which happens when r\u0000m>0i.e. when birth rate exceeds mortality rate. Ifk<0, or equivalently, r<mthen more people die on average than are born, so that the population shrinks and (eventually) go extinct. A simple model for human population growth The differential equation (11.5) and its initial condition led us to predict that a population grows or decays exponentially in time, according to Eqn. (11.6) . We can make this prediction quantitative by estimating the values of parame- tersrandm. To this end, let us consider the example of a human population and make further simplifying assumptions. We measure time in years. Assumptions. 80age 0number of people Figure 11.2: We assume a uniform age distribution to to determine the fraction of people who are fertile (and can give birth) or who are old (and likely to die). While slightly silly, this simplication helps estimate the desired parameters.The age distribution of the population is \"flat\", i.e. there are as many 10 year-olds as 70 year olds. Of course, this is quite inaccurate, but a good place to start since it is easy to estimate some of the quantities we need. Figure 11.2 shows such a uniform age distribution . The sex ratio is roughly 50%. This means that half of the population is female and half male. 80age 015 55fertilenumber of people Figure 11.3: We assume that only women between the ages of 15 and 55 years old are fertile and can give birth. Then, according to our uniform age distribution assumption, half of all women are between these ages and hence fertile.Women are fertile and can have babies only during part of their lives: we assume that the fertile years are between age 15 and age 55, as shown in Figure 11.3. A lifetime lasts 80 years. This means that for half of that time a given woman can contribute to the birth rate, or that(55\u000015) 80=50% of women alive at any time are able to give birth. During a woman's fertile years, we assume that on average, she has one baby every 10 years. We assume that deaths occur only from old age (i.e. we ignore disease, war, famine, and child mortality.) We assume that everyone lives precisely to age 80, and then dies instantly. 80age 0mortality occurs herenumber of people Figure 11.4: We assume that the people in the age bracket 79-80 years old all die each year, and that those are the only deaths. This, too, is a silly assumption, but makes it easy to estimate mortality in the population.Based on the above assumptions, we can estimate the birthrate parameter ras follows: r=number women population\u0001years fertile years of life\u0001number babies per woman number of years Thus we compute that r=1 2\u00011 2\u00011 10=0.025 births per person per year.234 AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Note that this value is now a rate per person per year, averaged over the Mastered Material Check 18. Under these assumptions, for a population size of 800, how many male 35 year-olds would you expect? Women in their 60's? 19. Is the fertility assumption reasonable? Why or why not? 20. Explain the units attached to the birthrate parameter r.entire population (male and female, of all ages). We need such an average rate since our model of Eqn. (11.5) assumes that individuals \"are identical\". We now have an approximate value for the average human per capita birth rate, r\u00190.025 per year. Next, using our assumptions, we estimate the mortality parameter, m. With the flat age distribution shown in Figure 11.2, there would be a fraction of 1/80of the population who are precisely removed by mortality every year (i.e. only those in their 80thyear.) In this case, we can estimate that the per capita mortality is: m=1 80=0.0125 deaths per person per year. The net per capita growth rate is k=r\u0000m=0.025\u00000.0125 =0.0125 per person per year. We often refer to the constant kas agrowth rate constant and we also say that the population grows at the rate of 1.25% per year. Example 11.3 Using the results of this section, nd a prediction for the population size N (t)as a function of time t. Solution. We have found that our population satises the equation dN dt= (r\u0000m)N=kN=0.0125 N, so that N(t) =N0e0.0125 t, (11.7) where N0is the starting population size. Figure 11.5 illustrates how this function behaves, using a starting value of N(0) =N0=7 billion. \u0006 20 40 60 80 1005101520 t(years)N(t)Human population Figure 11.5: Projected world population (in billions) over 100 years, based on the model in Eqn.

Based on Figure 11.5, when would we expect the human population to reach 15 billion?Example 11.4 (Human population in 100 years) Given the initial condi- tionN(0) =7billion, determine the size of the human population at t=100 years predicted by the model. Solution. At time t=0, the population is N(0) =N0=7billion. Then in billions, N(t) =7e0.0125 t so that when t=100 we would have N(100) =7e0.0125\u0001100=7e1.25=7\u00013.49=24.43. Thus, with a starting population of 7 billion, there would be about 24.4 billion after 100 years based on the uncontrolled continuous growth model. \u0006 A critique. Before leaving our population model, we should remember that our projections hold only so long as some rather restrictive assumptions are made. We have made many simplications, and ignored many features that would seriously affect these results. These include (among others),DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 235 variations in birth and mortality rates that stem from competition for resources and, epidemics that take hold when crowding occurs, and uneven distributions of resources or space. We have also assumed that the age distribution is uniform (flat), but that is not accurate: the population grows only by adding new infants, and this would skew the distribution even if it is initially uniform. All these factors suggest that some \"healthy skepticism\" should be applied to any model predictions. Predictions may cease to be valid if model assumptions are not satised. This caveat will lead us to think about more realistic models for population growth. Certainly, the uncontrolled exponential growth would not be sustainable in the long run. That said, such a model is a good starting point for a rst description of population growth, later to be adjusted. Growth and doubling In Chapter 10, we used base 2to launch our discussion of exponential growth and population doublings. We later discovered that base eis more convenient for calculus, having a more elegant derivative. We also saw in Chapter 10, that bases of exponents can be inter-converted. These skills are helpful in our discussion of doubling times below. The doubling time. How long would it take a population to double, given that it is growing exponentially with growth rate k? We seek =2N0. Then N(t) =2N0and N(t) 2N0=N0ekt,) 2=ekt) ln(2) =ln(ekt) =kt. We doubling time , denoted tis: t=ln(2) k. Mastered Material Check 22. What are the units associated witht? 23. The human population hit 3 billion in 1959. How does this t with our (imperfect) model?Example 11.5 (Human population doubling time) Determine the doubling time for the human population based on the results of our approximate growth model. Solution. We have found a growth rate of roughly k=0.0125 per year for the human population. Based on this, it would take t=ln(2) 0.0125=55.45 years236 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES for the population to double. Compare this with the graph of Fig 11.5, and note that over this time span, the population increases from 6 to 12 billion. \u0006 Note: the observant student may notice that we are simply converting back from base eto base 2 when we compute the doubling time. We summarize an important observation: In general, an equation of the form dy dt=ky that represents an exponential growth has a doubling time of t=ln(2) k. This is shown in Figure 11.6. We have discovered that based on the uncontrolled growth model, the population doubles every 55 years ! After 110 years, for example, there have been two doublings, or a quadrupling of the population. ty y02y0 Figure 11.6: Doubling time for exponential growth.Example 11.6 (A ten year doubling time) Suppose we are told that some animal population doubles every 10years. What growth rate would lead to such a trend? Solution. In this case, t=10 years. Rearranging t=ln(2) k, we obtain k=ln(2) t=0.6931 10\u00190.07 per year. Thus, a growth rate of 7% leads to doubling roughly every 10 years. \u0006 11.3 Radioactive decay Section 11.3 Learning goals 1.Describe the model for the number of radioactive atoms and explain how this leads to a differential equation. 2. Determine the solution of the resulting differential equation. 3.Given the initial amount, determine the amount of radioactivity remaining at a future time. 4.Describe the link between half-life of the radioactive material and its decay rate; given the value of one, be able to nd the value of the other.DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 237 A radioactive material consists of atoms that undergo a spontaneous change. Every so often, some radioactive atom emits a particle, and decays into an inert form. We call this a process of radioactive decay . For any one atom, it is impossible to predict when this event would occur exactly, but based on the behaviour of a large number of atoms decaying spontaneously, we can assign a probability kof decay per unit time. Can we give an \"for example..\" for this? In this section, we use the same kind of book-keeping (keeping track of the number of radioactive atoms remaining) as in the population growth example, to arrive at a differential equation that describes the process. Once we have the equation, we determine its solution and make a long-term prediction about the amount of radioactivity remaining at a future time. Deriving the model We start by letting N(t)be the number of radioactive atoms at time t. Gener- ally, we would know N(0), the number present initially. Our goal is to make simple assumptions about the process of decay that allows us to arrive at a mathematical model to predict values of N(t)at any later time t>0. Assumptions. (1)The process of radioactive decay is random, but on average, the probabil- ity of decay for a given radioactive atom is kper unit time where k>0is some constant. (2)During each (small) time interval of length Dt=h, a radioactive atom has probability khof decaying. This is merely a restatement of (1). Mastered Material Check 24. Suppose a given atom has a 1% chance of decay per 24 hours. What is this atom's probability of decay per week? Per hour?Suppose that at some time t, there are N(t)radioactive atoms. Then, according to our assumptions, during the time period t\u0014t\u0014t+h, on average khN(t0)atoms would decay. How many are there at time t+h? We can write the following balance-equation: 2 64Amount left at time t\u0014t\u0014t+h3 75 or, restated: N(t+h) =N(t)\u0000khN(t). (11.8) Here we have assumed that his a small time period. Rearranging Eqn. (11.8) leads to N(t+h)\u0000N(t) h=\u0000kN(t). Considering the left hand side of this equation, we let hget smaller and smaller ( h!0) and recall h=dN dt=N0(t)238 AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES where we have used the notation for a derivative of Nwith respect to t. We have thus shown that a description of the population of radioactive atoms reduces todN dt=\u0000kN. (11.9) We have, once more, arrived at a differential equation that provides a link between a function of time N(t)and its own rate of change dN/dt. Indeed, this equation species that dN/dtis proportional to N, but with a negative constant of proportionality which implies decay. Above we formulated the entire model in terms of the number of radioac- tive atoms. However, as shown below, the same equation holds regardless of the system of units used measure the amount of radioactivity Example 11.7 Dene the number of moles of radioactive material by y(t) number of molecules \u00196.022\u00021023- quantity, i.e. just a number with no associ- ated units). Determine the differential equation satised by y (t). Solution. We write y(t) =N(t)/Ain the form N(t) =Ay(t)and substitute this expression for N(t)in Eqn. (11.9) . We use the fact that Ais a constant to simplify the derivative. Then dN dt=\u0000kN)Ady(t) dt=\u0000k(Ay(t))) Ady(t) dt=A(\u0000ky(t)) cancelling the to dy(t) dt=\u0000ky(t), or simplydy dt=\u0000ky. (11.10) Thus y(t)satises the same kind of differential equation (with the same negative proportionality constant) between the derivative and the original function. We will refer to (11.10) as the decay equation . \u0006 Solution to the decay equation (11.10) Suppose that initially, there was an amount y0. Then, together, the differential equation and initial condition are dy dt=\u0000ky,y(0) =y0. (11.11) We often refer to this pairing between a differential equation and an initial condition as an initial value problem . Next, we show that an exponential function is an appropriate solution to this problem Example 11.8 (Checking a solution) Show that the function y(t) =y0e\u0000kt. (11.12) is a solution to initial value problem (11.11) .DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 239 Solution. Ee compute the derivative of the candidate function (11.12) , and rearrange, obtaining dy(t) dt=d dt[y0e\u0000kt] =y0de\u0000kt dt=\u0000ky0e\u0000kt=\u0000ky(t). This veries that for the derivative of the function is \u0000ktimes the original function, so satises the DE in (11.11) . We can also check that the initial condition is satised: y(0) =y0e\u0000k\u00010=y0e0=y0\u00011=y0. Hence, Eqn. (11.12) is the solution to the initial value problem for radioactive decay. For k>0a constant, this is a decreasing function of time that we refer to as exponential decay . \u0006 The half life Given a process of exponential decay, how long would it take for half of the original amount to remain? Let us recall that the \"original amount\" (at time t=0) isy0. Then we are looking for the time tsuch that y0/2remains. We must solve for tin y(t) =y0 2. We refer to the value of tthat satises this as the half life . Example 11.9 (Half life) Determine the half life in the exponential decay described by Eqn. (11.12) . e\u0000kt=ekt. Thus we nd the same result as in our calculation for doubling times, namely, ln(2) =ln(ekt) =kt, so that the half life is t=ln(2) k. This is shown in Figure 11.7. ty y0 y0 2 Figure 11.7: Half-life in an exponentially decreasing process.Example 11.10 (Chernobyl: April 1986) In 1986 the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, and scattered radioactive material over Europe. The radioactive element iodine-131 (I131) has half-life of 8 days whereas cesium- 137 (Cs137) has half life of 30 years. Use the model for radioactive decay to predict how much of this material would remain over time.240 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Solution. We rst determine the decay constants for each of these two elements, by noting that k=ln(2) t, and recalling that ln (2)\u00190.693. Then for I131we have k=ln(2) t=ln(2) 8=0.0866 per day. Then the amount of I131left at time t(in days) would be yI(t) =y0e\u00000.0866 t. For Cs137 k=ln(2) 30=0.023 per year. so that for Tin years, yC(T) =y0e\u00000.023 T. Note: we have used Trather than tto emphasize that units are different in the two calculations done in this example. Example 11.11 (Decay to 0.1% of the initial level) How long it would take for I131to decay to 0.1 % of its initial level? Assume that the initial level occurred just after the explosion at Chernobyl. Mastered Material Check 25. Repeat the calculation in Example 11.11 for Cesium. 26. Convert the Cesium decay time units to days and repeat the calculation of Example 11.10 with the new time units. 27. If the decay rate of a substance is 10% per day, what is its half-life?Solution. We must calculate the time tsuch \u00000.0866=\u00006.9 \u00000.0866=79.7 days. Thus it would take about 80 days for the level of Iodine-131 to decay to 0.1% of its initial level. \u0006 11.4 Deriving a differential equation for the growth of cell mass /facetime_videoDerivation of a differential equation that describes cell growth resulting from absorption and consumption of nutrients.In Section 1.2, we asked how the size of a living cell influences the balance between the rates of nutrient absorption (called A) and consumption (denoted C). But what if the two processes do not balance? What happens to the cell if the rates are unequal? If a cell absorb nutrients faster than nutrients are consumed ( A>C), some of the excess nutrients accumulate, and this buildup of nutrient mass can be converted into cell mass. This can result in growth (increase of cell mass). Conversely, if the consumption rate exceeds the rate of absorption of nutrients (C>A), the cell has a shortage of metabolic \"fuel\", and needs to convert some of its own mass into energy reserves that can power its metabolism - this would lead to loss in cell mass.DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 241 We can keep track of such changes in cell mass by using a simple \"balance equation\". The balance equation states that \"the rate of change of cell mass is the difference between the rate of nutrient (mass) coming in ( A) and the rate of nutrient (mass) being consumed ( C), i.e. dm dt=A\u0000C. (11.13) Each term in this equation must have the same units, mass of nutrient per unit time. Acontributes positively to mass increase, whereas Cis a rate of depletion that makes a negative contribution (hence the signs associated with terms in the equation). It also makes sense to adopt the assumptions previously made in Section 1.2 (and Featured Problem 9.1) that A=k1S,C=k2V,m=rV, where S,V,rare the surface area, volume, and density of the cell, and Mastered Material Check What are the units of k1,k2,r?k1,k2,rare positive constants. Then Eqn. (11.13) becomes dm dt=A\u0000C)d(rV) dt=k1S\u0000k2V. (11.14) The above equation is rather general, and does not depend on cell shape. Now consider the special case of a spherical cell for which V= (4/3)pr3, S=4pr2. This simplication will permit us to convert the balance equation into a differential equation that describes changes in cell radius over time. Now Eqn. (11.14) can be rewritten as d[r\u0001(4/3)pr3] dt=k1(4pr2)\u0000k2(4/3)pr3. (11.15) We can simplify the derivative on the right hand side using the chain rule, as done in Featured Problem 9.1, obtaining r4p 3p(3r2)dr dt=k1(4pr2)\u0000k2(4/3)pr3. (11.16) What does this tell us about cell radius? One way to satisfy Eqn. (11.16) is to set r=0in each term. While this is a \"solution\" to the equation, it is not biologically interesting. (It merely describes a \"cell\" of zero radius that never changes.) Suppose r6=0. In that case, we can cancel out a factor of r2from both sides of the equation. (We can also cancel out 4 p.) After some simplication, we arrive at Hint: If we use units of mm (=10\u00006m) for cell radius, pg (=10\u000012gm) for mass, and measure time in hours, then approximate values of the constants are r=1pgmm\u00003, k1=1pgmm\u00002hr\u00001, and k2=0.3pg mm\u00003hr\u00001. In that case, units and taking into account typical cell size and density, this equation might look something like dr dt=(1\u00000.1r). (11.17)242 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES From a statement about how cell mass changes, we have arrived at a resultant prediction about the rate of change of the cell radius. The equation we obtained is a differential equation that tells us something about a growing cell. In an upcoming chapter, we will build tools to be able to understand what this equation says, how to solve it for the cell radius r(t)as a function of time t, and what such analysis predicts about the dynamics of cells with different initial sizes. 11.5 Summary 1.A differential equation is a statement linking the rate of change of some state variable with current values of that variable. An example is the simplest population growth model: if N(t)is population size at time t: dN dt=kN. 2.A solution to a differential equation is a function that satises the equation. For instance, the function N(t) =Cekt(for any constant C) is a solution to the unlimited population growth model (we check this by the appropriate differentiation). Graphs of such solutions (e.g. N versus t) are called solution curves. 3.To select a specic solution, more information (an initial condition) is needed. Given this information, e.g. N(0) =N0, we can fully characterize the desired solution. 4.Thedecay equation is one representative of the same class of problems, and has an exponentially differential equations with simple (exponen- tial) functions for their solutions. In general, it may be quite challenging to make the connection between the differential equation (stemming from some application or model) with the solution (which we want in order to understand and predict the behaviour of the system.)Scientic problem or system Facts, observations assumptions, hypotheses\"Laws of Nature\" or statements about rates of change Mathematical model Differential equation(s) describing the systemSolutions to the differential equationsPredictions about the systme behaviour Figure 11.8: A \"flow chart\" showing how differential equations originate from scientic problems.In this chapter, we saw examples in which a natural phenomenon (popula- tion growth, radioactive decay, cell growth) motivated a mathematical model that led to a differential equation. In both cases, that equation was derived by making a statement that tracked the amount or number or mass of a system over time. Numerous simplications were made to derive each differential equation. For example, we assumed that the birth and mortality rates stay xed even as the population grows to huge sizes.DI FFERENTI AL EQUATI ONS FO R EXPO NENTIA L GROW TH AND DECAY 243 With regard to a larger context. Our purpose was to illustrate how a simple model is created, and what such models can predict. In general, differential equation models are often based on physical laws (\"F=ma\") or conservation statements (\"rate in minus rate out equals net rate of change\", or \"total energy = constant\"). In biology, where the laws governing biochemical events are less formal, the models are often based on some mix of speculation and reasonable assumptions. In Figure 11.8 we illustrate how the scientic method leads to a cycle between the mathematical models and their test and validation using observations about the natural world. Quick Concept Checks 1.

We encountered a differential equation that tracks changes in cell mass due to nutrient absorption and consumption. Finally, we learned that the solutions to a differential equation is a function. In applications studied, that function can be interpreted as predictions of the behaviour of the system or process over time. In this chapter, we further develop some of these ideas. We explore several techniques for nding and verifying that a given function is a solution to a differential equation. We then examine a simple class of differential equations that have many applications to processes of production and decay, and nd their solutions. Finally, we show how an approximation method provides for numerical solutions of such problems. 12.1 Verifying that a function is a solution Section 12.1 Learning goals 1.Given a function, check whether that function does or does not satisfy a given differential equation. 2.Verify whether a given function does or does not satisfy an initial condi- tion. In this section we concentrate on analytic solutions to a differential equation. By analytic solution , we mean a \"formula\" such as y=f(x)that satises the given differential equation. We saw in Chapter 11 that we can check whether a function satises a differential equation (e.g., Example 11.8) by simple differentiation. In this section, we further demonstrate this process. Example 12.1 Show that the function y(t) = ( 2t+1)1/2is a solution to the250 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES differential equation and initial condition dy dt=1 y,y(0) =1. Solution. First, we check dt=1 2(2t+1)\u00001/2\u00012 = ( 2t+1)\u00001/2=1 (2t+1)1/2=1 y. Hence, the function satises the differential equation. We must also verify the initial condition. We nd that y(0) = ( 2\u00010+1)1/2=11/2=1. Thus the initial condition is also satised, and y(t)is indeed a solution. \u0006 Example 12.2 Consider the differential equation and initial condition dy dt=1\u0000y,y(0) =y0. (12.1) a)Show that the function y(t) =y0e\u0000tisnota solution to this differential equation. b)Show that the function y (t) =1\u0000(1\u0000y0)e\u0000tisa solution. Solution. a)To check whether y(t) =y0e\u0000tis a solution to the differential equa- tion(12.1) , we substitute the function into hand side\", LHS; \"right hand side\". RHS) of the equation. We show the results in the columns of Table 12.1. After some steps in the simplication, we see that the two sides do not match, and conclude that the function is not a solution, as it fails to satisfy the equationLHS RHS dy y(t) =y0e\u0000tis not a solution to the differential equation (12.1) . Plugging the function into each side of the DE and simplifying (down the rows) leads to expressions that do not match. b)Similarly, we check the second function. The calculations (1\u0000y0)e\u0000tis a solution to the differential equation (12.1) . The expressions we get by evaluating each side of the differential equation do match.are shown in columns of Table 12.2. We nd that RHS=LHS, so the differential equation is satised. Finally, let us show that the initial condi- tiony(0) =y0is also satised. Plugging in t=0 we have y(0) =1\u0000(1\u0000y0)e0=1\u0000(1\u0000y0)\u00011=1\u0000(1\u0000y0) =y0. Thus, both differential equation and initial condition are satised. \u0006 Example 12.3 (Height of water draining out of a cylindrical container) A cylindrical container with cross-sectional area Ahas a small hole of area a at its base, through which water leaks out. It can be shown that height of water h (t)in the container satises the differential equation dh dt=\u0000kp h, (12.2)SOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 251 (where kis a constant that depends on the size and shape of the cylinder and its hole: k=a Ap2g>0andgis acceleration due to gravity.)

Substi- tutet=0into the function (12.3) . Then we nd h(0) =h0, verifying the initial conditions. To show that the differential equation (12.2) is satised, we differentiate the have used the power law and the chain rule, remembering that h0,k are constants. Now we notice that, using Eqn. (12.3) , the expression forp h(t) exactly matches what we have computed for dh/dt. Thus, we have shown that the function in Eqn. (12.3) satises both the initial condition and the differential equation. \u0006 As shown in Examples 12.1- 12.3, if we are told that a function is a solution to a differential equation, we can check the assertion and verify that it is correct or incorrect. A much more difcult task is to nd the solution of a new differential equation from rst principles. In some cases, integration , learned in second semester calculus, can be used. In others, some transformation that changes the problem to a more familiar one is helpful - an example of this type is presented in Section 12.2. In many cases, particularly those of so-called non-linear differential equa- tions, great expertise and familiarity with advanced mathematical methods are required to nd the solution to such problems in an analytic form, i.e. as an explicit formula. In such cases, approximation and numerical methods are helpful.252 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 12.2 Equations of the form y0(t) =a\u0000by Section 12.2 Learning goals 1.Dene steady states of a differential equation, and be able to nd such special solutions. 2.Starting with the differential equation (12.4) y0=a\u0000by, nd a new differential equation for the deviation away from a steady state, z(t)and show that it is a simple decay equation. 3.Use the transformed (decay) equation to nd the solution for z(t)and, for y(t)in the original equation, (12.4). 4.Explain Newton's Law of Cooling (NLC), and the differential equation of the same type, y0=a\u0000by.

In this section we introduce an important class of differential equations that have many applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and other applica- tions. All share a similar structure, namely all are of the form dy dt=a\u0000by,y(0) =y0. (12.4) First, we show how a solution to such equation can be found. Then, we examine a number of applications. Special solutions: steady states We rst ask about \"special solutions\" to the differential equation (12.4) in which there is no change over time. That is, we ask whether there are values ofyfor which dy/dt=0. /facetime_videoAn explanation of the way we nd solutions to equations of the form dy dt=a\u0000by, with y(0) =y0.From (12.4), we nd that such solutions satisfy dy dt=0) a\u0000by=0) y=a b. Figure 12.1: y=a/bis a constant solution to the differential equation in (12.4) . We call this type of solution a steady state .In other words, if we were to start with the initial value y(0) =a/b, then that value would not change, since it satises dy/dt=0, so that the solution at all future times would be y(t) =a/b. (Of course, this is a perfectly good function; it is simply a function that is alway constant.) We refer to such constant solutions as Steady States .SOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 253 Other solutions: away from steady state What happens if we start with a value of ythat is not exactly at the \"special\" steady state? Let us rewrite the DE in a more suggestive form, dy dt=a\u0000by)dy dt=\u0000b\u0010 y\u0000a b\u0011 , (having factored out \u0000b). The advantage is that we recognize the expression (y\u0000a b)as the difference, or deviation ofyaway from its steady state value. (That deviation could be either positive or negative, depending on whether yis larger or smaller than a/b.) We ask whether this deviation gets larger or smaller as time goes by, i.e., whether ygets further away or closer to its steady state value a/b. Dene z(t)as that deviation, that is Figure 12.2: We dene z(t)as the deviation ofyfrom its steady state value. Here we show two typical initial values of z, where z0=y0\u0000a b.z(t) =y(t)\u0000a b, Then, since a,bare constants, we recognize that dz dt=dy dt. Second, the initial value of zfollows simply from the initial value of y: z(0) =y(0)\u0000a b=y0\u0000a b. Now we can transform the equation (12.4) into a new differential equation for the variable zby using these two facts. We can replace the yderivative by thezderivative, and also, y\u0000a b\u0011 =\u0000bz. Hence, we have transformed the original DE and IC into the new problem Figure 12.3: The deviation away from steady state (blue, grey curves) is z(t) =y(t)\u0000a/b. We can solve the differential equation for z(t)because it is a simple exponential decay equation. Here we show two typical solutions for z. Figure 12.4: Finally, we can determine the solution y(t).dz dt=\u0000bz,z(0) =z0,h where z0=y0\u0000a bi . But this is the familiar decay initial value problem that we have already solved before. So z(t) =z0e\u0000bt. We have arrived at the conclusion that the deviation from steady state decays exponentially with time, provided that b>0. Hence, we already know that y should get closer to the constant value a/bas time goes by! We can do even better than this, by transforming the solution we found forz(t)into an expression for y(t). To do so, use the denition once more, setting /_481Adjust the sliders to see how the parameters aandband the initial value y0affect the shape of the function FE SCIEN CES Example 12.4 ( a=b=1)Suppose we are given the differential equation and initial conditiondy dt=1\u0000y,y(0) =y0.

Rewrite these four initial conditions as the initial deviations away from steady state, that is, give the initial values, z0of the deviation.By substituting a=1,b=1 in the solution found above, we observe that y(t) =1\u0000(1\u0000y0)e\u0000t. Representative curves in this family of solutions are shown in Figure 12.5 for various initial values y0. \u0006 We now apply the methods to a number of examples. Featured Problem 12.1 (Predicting the size of a growing cell) Find a solution to the differential equation (11.17) for the radius of a growing cell r(t)(in units of mm=10\u00006m) as a function of time t(in hours), that is nd r(t)assuming that at time t =0the cell is 2 mm in radius. By solving the above problem, we get a detailed prediction of cell growth based on assumed rates of nutrient intake and consumption. Newton's law of cooling Consider an object at temperature T(t)in an environment whose ambient temperature is E. Depending on whether the object is cooler or warmer than the environment, it heats up or cools down. From common experience we know that, after a long time, the temperature of the object equilibrates with its environment. Isaac Newton formulated a hypothesis to describe the rate of change of temperature of an object. He assumed that The rate of change of temperature Tof an object is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature, E. To rephrase this statement mathematically, we write dT dtis proportional to (T(t)\u0000E). This implies that the derivative dT/dtis some constant multiple of the term (T(t)\u0000E). However, the sign of that constant requires some discussion. Denote the constant of proportionality by atemporarily, and suppose a\u00150. Let us check whether the differential equation dT dt=a(T(t)\u0000E), makes physical sense. Mastered Material Check 7. What can we say about the units ofTandE?Suppose the object is warmer than its environment ( T(t)>E). Then T(t)\u0000E)>0anda\u00150implies that dT/dt>0which says that theSOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 255 temperature of the object should get warmer ! But this does not agree with our everyday experience: a hot cup of coffee cools off in a chilly room. Hence a\u00150cannot be correct. Based on this, we conclude that Newton's Law of Cooling, written in the form of a differential equation, should read: dT dt=k(E\u0000T(t)), where k>0. (12.7) Note: the sign of the term in braces has been switched. Typically, given the temperature at some initial time T(0) =T0, we want to predict T(t)for later time. Example 12.5 Consider the temperature T(t)as a function of time. Solve the differential equation for Newton's law of cooling dT dt=k(E\u0000T), together with the initial condition T (0) =T0. Solution. As before, we transform the variable to reduce the differential equation to one that we know how to solve. This time, we select the new variable to be z(t) =E\u0000T(t). Then, by steps similar to previous examples, we nd that dz(t) dt=\u0000kz. We also rewrite the initial condition in terms of z, leading to z(0) =E\u0000 T(0) =E\u0000T0. After carrying out Steps 1-3 the solution for T(t), T(t) =E+ (T0\u0000E)e\u0000kt. (12.8)Mastered Material Check 8. Fill in the details for Example 12.5. 9.

Example 12.6 Explain (in words) what the form of the solution in Eqn. (12.8) of Newton's law of cooling implies about the temperature of an object as it warms or cools. Solution. We make the following remarks It is straightforward to verify that the initial temperature is T(0) =T0 (substitute t=0into the solution of Eqn. (12.8) ). Now examine the time dependence. Only one term, e\u0000ktdepends on time. Since k>0, this is an exponentially decaying function, whose magnitude shrinks with time. The whole term that it multiplies, (T0\u0000E)e\u0000kt, continually THE LI FE SCIEN CES Thus the temperature of the object always approaches the ambient temper- ature. This is evident in the solution curves shown in Figure 12.6. We also observe that the direction of approach (decreasing or increasing) depends on the sign of the constant (T0\u0000E). IfT0>E, the temperature approaches Efrom above, whereas if T0<E, the temperature approaches E from below. In the specic case that T0=E, there is no change at all. T=Esatises dT/dt=0, and corresponds to a steady state of the differential equation, as previously dened. Steady states are studied in more detail in Chapter 13.Mastered Material Check 11. Consider three cups of coffee left in a 20\u000eC room. If one is iced, another is piping hot, and the third is room temperature, which cup will not change temperature? Which, thus, represents a steady state? 12. Convert the temperatures in Example 12.7 to Fahrenheit and repeat. Using Newton's law of cooling to solve a mystery Now that we have a detailed solution to the differential equation representing Newton's law of cooling, we can apply it to making exact determinations of temperature over time, or of time at which a certain temperature was attained. The following example illustrates an application of this idea. Example 12.7 (Murder mystery) It is a dark clear night. The air temper- ature is 10\u000eC. A body is discovered at midnight. Its temperature is 27\u000eC. One hour later, the body has cooled to 24\u000eC. Use Newton's law of cooling to determine the time of death. /facetime_videoDetails of the calculations for Example 12.7. Solution. We assume that body-temperature just before death was 37\u000eC (normal human body temperature). Let t=0be the time of death. Then the initial temperature is T(0) =T0=37\u000eC. We want to nd the time elapsed until the body was found, i.e. time tat which the temperature of the body had cooled down to 27\u000eC. We assume that the ambient temperature, E=10, was constant. From Newton's law of cooling, the body temperature satises dT dt=k(10\u0000T). From previous work and Eqn. (12.8), the solution to this DE is T(t) =10+ (37\u000010)e\u0000kt. We do not know the value of the constant k, but we have enough informa- tion to nd it. First, at discovery, the body's temperature was 27\u000e. Hence at time t 27=10+27e\u0000kt) 17=27e\u0000kt. Also at t+1 (one hour after discovery), the 24\u000eC, =10+ (37\u000010)e\u0000k(t+1)=24,) S 257 We have two equations for the two unknowns tandk. To solve for k, take a ratio of the sides of the equations. Then 14 17=27e\u0000k(t+1) 27e\u0000kt=e\u0000k) \u0000 k=ln\u001214 17\u0013 =\u00000.194.

Use your plot to estimate how long it took for the body to cool off to 33\u000eC. t=0.4626 k=0.4626 0.194=2.384 hours. \u0006 Related applications and further examples Having gained familiarity with specic examples, we now return to the general case and summarize the results. The differential equation and initial condition dy dt=a\u0000by,y(0) =y0 (12.9) has the . Then we can summarize the behaviour of the solutions (12.10) as follows: The time dependence of Eqn. (12.10) is contained in the term e\u0000bt, which (forb>0) is exponentially decreasing. As time increases, t!\u00a5, the exponential term becomes negligibly small, so y!a/b. If initially y(0) =y0>a/b, then y(t)approaches a/bfrom above, whereas ify0<a/b, it approaches a/bfrom below. If initially y0=a/b, there is no change at all ( dy/dt=0). Thus y=a/bis asteady state of the DE in Eqn. (12.9). Recognizing such general structure means that we can avoid repeating similar calculations from scratch in related examples. Newton's law of cooling is one representative of the class of differential equations of the form Eqn. (12.9) . If we set a=kE,b=kandT=yin Eqn. (12.9) get back to258 DI FFERENTI CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Eqn. (12.7) . As expected from the general case, Tapproaches a/b=E, the ambient temperature, which corresponds to a steady state of NLC. Next, we describe other examples that share this structure, and hence similar dynamic behaviour.

(12.11) comes from a simple force balance: ma=Fgravity\u0000Fdrag, and from the assumption that Fdrag=mv, where m>0 is the \"drag coefcient\". Dividing both sides by mand replacing abydv/dtleads to this equation, with k=m/m.tion satised by the velocity v(t)of the falling object with friction is dv dt=g\u0000kv (12.11) where g>0is acceleration due to gravity and k>0is a constant representing the effect of air resistance. (In contrast to the \"upwards pointing\" coordinate system used in Example 4.10, here we focus on how the magnitude of the velocity changes with time.) Usually, a frictional force is assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the object, and to act in a direction that slows it down. (This accounts for the negative sign in Eqn. (12.11) .) Parachutes operate on the principle of enhancing that frictional force to damp out the acceleration of a skydiver. Hence, Eqn. (12.11) is often called the skydiver equation . Example 12.8 Use the general results for Eqn. (12.9) to write down the solution to the differential equation (12.11) for the velocity of a skydiver given the initial condition v(0) =v0. Interpret your results in a simple description of what happens over time. Mastered Material Check 16. Assign appropriate units to each of the parameters in Example 12.8. 17. When a sky-diver steps into the void, her initial vertical velocity is zero. Write down her velocity v(t)based on results of Example 12.8 .Solution. Eqn. (12.11) is of the same form as Eqn. (12.9) , and has the same type of solutions. We merely have to adjust the notation, by identifying v(t)!y(t),g!a,k!b,v0!y0. Hence, without further calculation, we can conclude that the solution of (12.11) together with its initial condition is: v(t) =g k\u0000\u0010g k\u0000v0\u0011 e\u0000kt. (12.12) The velocity is initially v0, and eventually approaches g/kwhich is the steady state orterminal velocity for the object. Depending on the initial speed, the object either slows down (if v0>g/k) or speed up (if v0<g/k) as it approaches the terminal velocity. \u0006 Chemical production and decay. A chemical reaction inside a xed reaction volume produces a substance at a constant rate Kin. A second reaction results in decay of that substance at a rate proportional to its concentration. Let c(t) denote the time-dependent concentration of the substance, and assume that time is measured in units of hours. Then, writing down a balance equation leads to a differential equation of the form dc dt=Kin\u0000gc. (12.13)SOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 259 Here, the rst term is the rate of production and the second term is the rate of decay. The net rate of change of the chemical concentration is then the difference of the two. The constants Kin>0,g>0represent the rate of production and decay - recall that the units of each term in any equation have to match. For example, if the concentration cis measured in units of milli-Molar (mM), then dc/dthas units of mM/hr, and hence Kinmust have units of mM/h and gmust have units of 1/hr. Example 12.9 Write down the solution to the DE (12.13) given the initial condition c (0) =c0. Determine the steady state chemical concentration. Solution. Translating notation from the general case to this example, c(t)!y(t), Kin!a, g!b. Then we can =Kin g\u0000\u0012Kin g\u0000c0\u0013 e\u0000gt. (12.14) Regardless of its initial condition, the chemical concentration will approach a steady state concentration is c=Kin/g. \u0006 In this section we have seen that the behaviour found in the general case of the differential equation (12.4) , can be reinterpreted in each specic situation of interest. This points to one powerful aspect of mathematics, namely the ability to use results in abstract general cases to solve a variety of seemingly unrelated scientic problems that share the same mathematical structure.

Note: Information for Problem 12.2 is adapted from [Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2016], and may reflect many simplications and approximations. In actual fact, most \"constants\" in the problem are time-dependent, making the real problem of predicting CO 2levels much more challenging. 12.3 Euler's Method and numerical solutions Section 12.3 Learning goals 1.Explain the idea of a numerical solution to a differential equation and how this compares with an exact or analytic solution. 2.Describe how Euler's method is based on approximating the derivative by the slope of a secant line. 3.Use Euler's method to calculate a numerical solution (using a spreadsheet) to a given initial value problem. So far, we have explored ways of understanding the behaviour predicted by a differential equation in the form of an analytic solution , namely an explicit formula for the solution as a function of time. However, in reality this is typically difcult without extensive training, and occasionally, impossible even for experts. Even if we can nd such a solution, it may be inconve- nient to determine its numerical values at arbitrary times, or to interpret its behaviour. For this reason, we sometimes need a method for computing an approx- imation for the desired solution. We refer to that approximation as a nu- merical solution . The idea is to harness a computational device - computer, laptop, or calculator - to nd numerical values of points along the solution curve, rather than attempting to determine the formula for the solution as a function of time. We illustrate this process using a technique called Euler's method , which is based on an approximation of a derivative by the slope of a secant line. Below, we describe how Euler's method is used to approximate the solution to a general initial value problem (differential equation together with initial condition) of the form dy dt=f(y),y(0) =y0. Set up. We rst must pick a \"step size,\" Dt, and subdivide the taxis into discrete steps of that size. We thus have a set of time points t1,t2,:::,spacedSOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 261 Dtapart as shown in Figure 12.8. Our procedure starts with the known initial value y(0) =y0, and uses it to generate an approximate value at the next time point ( y1), then the next ( y2), and so on. We denote by ykthe value of the independent variable generated at the k'th time step by Euler's method as an approximation to t4 t5timet Figure 12.8: The time axis is subdivided into steps of size Dt. Method. We approximate the differential equation by a nite difference equation dy dt=f(y)approximated byyk+1\u0000yk Dt=f(yk). This approximation is reasonable only when Dt, the time step size, is small.Mastered Material Check 18. IfDt=0.1andt0=0, what are t1,t2 andt3? 19. Explain the difference between the value y1and the true solution y(t1). 20. If Dtis not sufciently small, why might Euler's method give a bad approximation to the solution? Rearranging this equation leads to a process (also called recurrence relation ) for linking values of the solution at successive time points, yk+1\u0000yk Dt=f(yk),) yk+1=yk+Dt\u0001f(yk). (12.16) Application. We start with the known initial value, y0. Then (setting the index to k=0 in Eqn. (12.16)) we obtain y1=y0+f(y0)Dt. The quantities on the right are known, so we can compute the value of y1, which is the approximation to the solution y(t1)at the time point t1. We can then continue to generate the value at the next time point in the same way, by approximating the derivative again as a secant slope. This leads to y2=y1+f(y1)Dt. The approximation so generated, leading to values y1,y2,:::is called Euler's method . Mastered Material Check 21. In Euler's method, can you determine t2directly? That is, without rst computing t1? 22. In Euler's method, can you determine y2directly? That is, without rst computing y1?Applying this approximation repeatedly, leads to an iteration method , that is, the repeated THE LI FE SCIEN CES From this iteration, we obtain the approximate values of the function yk\u0019y(tk) for as many time steps as desired starting from t=0in increments of Dtup to some nal time Tof interest. It is customary to use the following notations: t0:the initial time point, usually at t=0. h=Dt:common notations for the step size, i.e. the distance between the points along the taxis. tk:the k'th time point. Note that since the points are at multiples of the step size that we have picked, tk=kDt=kh. y(t):the actual value of the solution to the differential equation at time t. This is usually not known, but in the examples discussed in this chapter, we can solve the differential equation exactly, so we have a formula for the function y(t). In most hard scientic problems, no such formula is known in advance. y(tk):the actual value of the solution to the differential equation at one of the discrete time points, tk(again, not usually known). yk:the approximate value of the solution obtained by Euler's method. We hope that this approximate value is fairly close to the true value, i.e. that yk\u0019y(tk), but there is always some error in the approximation. More advanced methods that are specically designed to reduce such errors are discussed in courses on numerical analysis. Euler's method applied to population growth We illustrate how Euler's method is used in a familiar example, that of unlimited population growth. Example 12.10 Apply Euler's method to approximating solutions for the simple exponential growth model that was studied in Chapter 11, dy dt=ay,y(0) =y0 where a is a constant (see Eqn 11.2).

Subdivide the taxis into steps of size Dt, starting with t0=0, and t1=Dt,t2=2Dt,:::The rst value of yis known from the initial condition, y0=y(0) =y0. We replace the differential equation by the approximation yk+1\u0000yk Dt=ayk) yk+1=yk+aDtyk,k=1,2,:::SOLVI NG DI In particular, y1=y0+aDty0=y0(1+aDt), y2=y1(1+aDt), y3=y2(1+aDt), and so on. At every stage, the quantity on the right hand side depends only on value of ykthat as already known from the step before. \u0006 The next example demonstrates Euler's method applied to a specic differential equation.

Clearly, these kinds of repeated calculations are best handled on a spreadsheet or similar computer software. Euler's method applied to Newton's law of cooling We apply Euler's method to Newton's law of cooling. Upon completion, we can directly compare the approximate numerical solution generated by Euler's method to the true (analytic) solution, (12.8) , that we determined earlier in this chapter. Example 12.12 (Newton's law of cooling) Consider the temperature of an object T(t)in an ambient temperature of E=10\u000e. Assume that k=0.2/min. Use the initial value problem dT dt=k(E\u0000T),T(0) =T0 to write the exact solution to Eqn. (12.8) in terms of the initial value T 0. Solution. In this case, the differential equation has the form dT dt=0.2(10\u0000T), and its analytic solution, from Eqn. (12.8), is T(t) =10+ (T0\u000010)e\u00000.2t.

Use a spreadsheet for the calculations. Note that Dt=1.0is not a \"small step;\" we use it here for illustration purposes. Solution. The procedure to implement is Tk+1=Tk+0.2(10\u0000Tk)Dt. In Figure 12.9 we show a typical example of the method with initial value T(0) =T0and with the time step size Dt=1.0. Black dots represent the dis- crete values generated by the Euler method, starting from initial conditions, T0=0,5,15,20 . Notice that the black curve is simply made up of line seg- ments linking points obtained by the numerical solution. On the same graph,Mastered Material Check 26. What change would you make in the process set up in Example 12.14 to improve the approximation made by Euler's method? we also show the analytic solution (red curves) given by Eqn. (12.17) with theSOLVI NG DI FFERENTI AL EQUATION S 265 same four initial temperatures. We see that the black and red curves start out at the same points (since they both satisfy the same initial conditions). How- ever, the approximate solution obtained with Euler's method is not identical to the true solution. The difference between the two (gap between the red and black curves) is the numerical error in the approximation. 12.4 Summary 1.Given a function, we can check whether it is a solution to a differential equation by performing the appropriate differentiation and algebraic simplication. 2.Solutions to differential equations in which there is no change at all (\"constant solutions\") are referred to as steady states. 3. The differential equations dy dt=a\u0000by, y(0) =y0 has a steady state solution y=a/b. 4.If we dene the deviation from steady state, z(t) =y(t)\u0000a b, we get a decay equation for z(t)that has exponentially decreasing solutions provided b>0. This says that the eviation from steady state always decrease over time. 5. The resulting solution for y(t)is y(t) =a b\u0000\u0010a b\u0000y0\u0011 e\u0000bt. 6.For some differential equations, it is not always possible to determine an analytic solution (explicit formula). Numerical solutions can be found using Euler's method, and serve as an approximate solution. 7.Euler's method takes a known initial value y0and uses the iteration scheme: yk+1=yk+f(yk)Dt. to generate successive values of ykthat approximate the solution at time points tk=kDt 8.

What is meant by an analytic solution to a differential equation? 2. What other kind of solutions are possible? 3. Give an example of a nonlinear function f(y).Not all differential equations are easily solved analytically. Furthermore, even when we nd the analytic solution, it is not necessarily easy to interpret, graph, or understand. This situation motivates qualitative methods that promote an overall understanding of behaviour - directly from information in the differential equation - without the challenge of nding a full functional form of the solution. In this chapter we expand our familiarity with differential equations and assemble new, qualitative techniques for understanding them. We consider differential equations in which the expression on one side, f(y), isnonlinear , i.e. equations of the form dy dt=f(y) in which fis more complicated than the form a\u0000by.

We showed that this differential equation has exponential solutions. It means that two behaviours are generically obtained: explosive growth ifk>0 orextinction ifk<0. Mastered Material Check 4.What happens in the case that k=0? Explain under what conditions this might arise and what happens to the population N(t)in this case.The case of k>0is unrealistic, since real populations cannot keep growing indenitely in an explosive, exponential way. Eventually running out of space or resources, the population growth dwindles, and the population attains some static level rather than expanding forever. This motivates a revision of our previous model to depict density-dependent growth . The logistic equation for population growth LetN(t)represent the size of a population at time t, as before. Consider the differential equation dN dt=rN(K\u0000N) K.

If so, what are the values of a,b,g?Denition 13.1 (Linear differential equation) A rst order differential equation is said to be linear if it is a linear combination of terms of the form dy dt,y, 1 that is, it can be written in the form ady dt+by+g=0 (13.2) where a,b,gdo not depend on y. Note that \"rst order\" means that only the rst derivative (or no derivative at all) may occur in the equation.QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 277 So far, we have seen several examples of this type with constant coef- cients a,b,g. For example, and b=bin Eqn. (12.4) . A differential equation that is not of this form is said to be nonlinear. Example 13.1 (Linear versus nonlinear differential equations) Which of the following differential equations are and which are nonlinear? (a)dy dt=y2,(b)dy dt\u0000y=5,(c) ydy dt=\u00001. Solution. Any term of the form y2,py,1/y, etc. is nonlinear in y. A product such as ydy dtis also nonlinear in the independent variable. Hence equations (a), (c) are nonlinear, while (b) is linear. \u0006Mastered Material Check 6. For what values of a,bandgcan Example 13.1(b) be put into the form (13.2)?The signicance of the distinction between linear and nonlinear differ- ential equations is that nonlinearities make it much harder to systematically nd a solution to the given differential equation by \"analytic\" methods. Most linear differential equations have solutions that are made of exponential func- tions or expressions involving such functions. This is not true for nonlinear equations. However, as we see shortly, geometric methods are very helpful in under- standing the behaviour of such nonlinear differential equations. Law of Mass Action Nonlinear terms in differential equations arise naturally in various ways. One common source comes from describing interactions between individuals, as the following example illustrates. In a chemical reaction, molecules of types AandBbind and react to form product P. Let a(t),b(t)denote the concentrations of AandB. These concentrations depend on time because the chemical reaction uses up both types in producing the product. The reaction only occurs when AandBmolecules \"collide\" and stick to one another. Collisions occur randomly, but if concentrations are larger, more collisions take place, and the reaction is faster. If either the concentration aor bis doubled, then the reaction rate doubles. But if both aandbare doubled, then the reaction rate should be four times faster, based on the higher chances of collisions between AandB. The simplest assumption that captures this Mastered Material Check 7. If the concentration of Ais tripled, and that of Bis doubled, how much faster would we expect the reaction rate to be? 8. Why does the product a\u0001b, rather than the sum a+bappear in the Law of Mass Action ?dependence is rate of reaction is proportional to a\u0001b) rate of reaction =k\u0001a\u0001b where kis some constant that represents the reactivity of the molecules. We can formally state this result, known as the Law of Mass Action as follows:278 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES The Law of Mass Action: The rate of a chemical reaction involving an interaction of two or more chemical species is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the given species. Example 13.2 (Differential equation for interacting chemicals) Substance A is added at a constant rate of Imoles per hour to a 1-litre vessel. Pairs of molecules of Ainteract chemically to form a product P. Write down a differ- ential equation that keeps track of the concentration of A, denoted y (t). Mastered Material Check 9. In each of Examples 13.2 and 13.3, clearly identify the constant quantities.Solution. First consider the case that there is no reaction. Then, the addition ofAto the reactor at a constant rate leads to changing y(t), described by the differential equation dy dt=I. When the chemical reaction takes place, the depletion of Adepends on interactions of pairs of molecules. By the law of mass action, the rate of reaction is of the form k\u0001y\u0001y=ky2, and as it reduces the concentration, it appear with a minus sign in the DE. Hence dy dt=I\u0000ky2. This is a nonlinear differential equation - it contains a term of the form y2.\u0006 Example 13.3 (Logistic equation reinterpreted) Rewrite the logistic equation in the form dN dt=rN\u0000bN2 (where b =r/K is a positive quantity). a)Interpret the meaning of this restated form of the equation by explaining what each of the terms on the right hand side could represent. b)Which of the two terms dominates for small versus large population levels? Solution. a)This form of the equation has growth term rNproportional to population size, as encountered previously in unlimited population growth. However, there is also a quadratic (nonlinear) rate of loss (note the minus sign) \u0000bN2. This term could describe interactions between individuals that lead to mortality, e.g. through ghting or competition. b)From familiarity with power functions (in this case, the functions of N that form the two terms, rNandbN2) we can deduce that the second, quadratic term dominates for larger values of N, and this means that when the population is crowded, the loss of individuals is greater than the rate of reproduction. \u0006QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 279 Scaling the logistic equation Consider units involved in the logistic equation (13.1): dN dt=rN(K\u0000N) K. This equation has two parameters, randK. Since units on each side of an equation must balance, and must be the same for terms that are added or subtracted, we can infer that Khas the same units as N, and thus it is a population density. When N=K, the population growth rate is zero (dN/dt=0). It turns out that we can understand the behaviour of the logistic equation by converting it to a \"generic\" form that does not depend on the constant K. We do so by transforming variables, which amounts to choosing a convenient way to measure the population size. Example 13.4 (Rescaling) Dene a new variable y(t) =N(t) K, with N (t)and K as in the logistic equation. Then N (t) =Ky(t). a)Interpret what the transformed variable y represents. b)Rewrite the logistic equation in terms of this variable. Mastered Material Check 10. Suppose an environment can sustain 2000 aphids per plant, and the current population size on a given plant is 1700. What is K,N andybased on this information? 11. This population is at what percent of its carrying capacity?Solution. a)The variable, y(t)represents a scaled version of the population density. In- stead of measuring the population in some arbitrary units - such as number of individuals per acre, or number of bacteria per ml - y(t)measures the population in \"multiples of the carrying capacity.\" For example, if the environment can sustain 1000 aphids per plant (so K=1000 individuals per plant), and the current population size on a given plant is N=950then the value of the scaled variable is y=950/1000= 0.95. We would say that \"the aphid population is at 95% of its carrying capacity on the plant.\" b)Since Kis assumed constant, it follows that N(t) =Ky(t))dN dt=Kdy dt. Using this, we can simplify the logistic equation as follows: dN dt=rN(K\u0000N) K,) Kdy CALC CES Eqn. (13.3) \"looks simpler\" than Eqn. (13.1) since it depends on only one parameter, r. Moreover, by understanding this equation, and transforming back to the original logistic in terms of N(t) =Ky(t), we can interpret results for the original model. While we do not go further with transforming variables at present, it turns out that one can also further reduce the scaled logistic to an equation in which r=1 by \"rescaling time units\".Mastered Material Check 12. What are the units of the parameter r? 13. How might we use the parameter r to dene a time-scale? 13.2 The geometry of change Section 13.2 Learning goals 1.Explain what is a slope eld of a differential equation. Given a differential equation (linear or nonlinear), construct such a diagram and use it to sketch solution curves. 2.Describe what a state-space diagram is; construct such a diagram and use it to interpret the behaviour of solution curves to a given differential equation. 3.Identify the relationships between a slope eld, a state-space diagram, and a family of solution curves to a given differential equation. 4.Identify steady states of a differential equation and determine whether they are stable or unstable. 5.Given a differential equation and initial condition, predict the behaviour of the solution for t>0. In this section, we introduce a new method for understanding differen- tial equations using graphical and geometric arguments. Such methods circumvent the solutions that we expressed in terms of analytic formulae. We resort to concepts learned much earlier - for example, the derivative as a slope of a tangent line - in order to use the differential equation itself to assemble a sketch of the behaviour that it predicts. That is, rather than writing down y=F(t)as a solution to the differential equation (and then graphing that function) we sketch the qualitative behaviour of such solution curves directly from information contained in the differential equation. Slope elds Here we discuss a geometric way of understanding what a differential equa- tion is saying using a slope eld , also called a direction eld . We have already seen that solutions to a differential equation of the form dy dt=f(y)QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 281 are curves in the (y,t)-plane that describe how y(t)changes over time (thus, these curves are graphs of functions of time). Each initial condition y(0) =y0 is associated with one of these curves, so that together, these curves form a family of solutions. What do these curves have in common, geometrically? the slope of the tangent line ( dy/dt) at any point on any of the curves is related to the value of the y-coordinate of that point - as stated in the differential equation. at any point (t,y(t))on a solution curve, the tangent line must have slope f(y), which depends only on the yvalue, and not on the time t. Note: in more general cases, the expression f(y)that appears in the differ- ential equation might depend on tas well as y. For our purposes, we do not consider such examples in detail. By sketching slopes at various values of y,we obtain the slope eld through which we can get a reasonable idea of the behaviour of the solutions to the differential equation. Example 13.5 Consider the differential equation dy dt=2y. (13.4) Compute some of the slopes for various values of yand use this to sketch a slope eld for this differential equation. Mastered Material Check 14. Solve Differential Eqn. (13.4) analytically.Solution. Equation (13.4) states that if a solution curve passes through a point (t,y), then its tangent line at that point has a slope 2y, regardless of the value of t. This example is simple enough that we can state the following: for positive values of y, the slope is positive; for negative values of y, the slope is negative; and for y=0, the slope is zero. We provide some tabulated values of yindicating the values of the slope f(y), its sign, and what this implies about the local behaviour of the solution and its direction. Then, in Figure 13.1 we combine this information to yyy f ff(yyy) slope of tangent linebehaviour of yyy direction arrow -2 -4 -ve decreasing & -1 -2 -ve decreasing & 0 0 0 no change ! 1 2 +ve increasing % 2 4 +ve increasing %Table 13.1: Table for the slope eld diagram of differential equation (13.4) ,dy dt=2y, described in Example 13.5. generate the direction eld and the corresponding solution curves. Note that the direction of the arrows (rather than their absolute magnitude) provides the most important qualitative tendency for the slope eld sketch. \u0006282 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 0 1 2 3 4 521012 ty 0 1 2 3 4 521012 ty Figure 13.1: Direction eld and solution curves for differential equation,dy dt=2y described in Example 13.5. In constructing the slope eld and solution curves, the following basic rules should be followed: 1.By convention, time flows from left to right along the taxis in our graphs, so the direction of all arrows (not usually indicated explicitly on the slope eld) is always from left to right. 2.According to the differential equation, for any given value of the vari- able y, the slope is given by the expression f(y)in the differential equa- tion. The sign of that quantity is particularly important in determining whether the solution is locally increasing, decreasing, or neither. In the tables, we indicate this in the last column with the notation %,&, or!. 3.There is a single arrow at any point in the ty-plane, and consequently so- lution curves cannot intersect anywhere (although they can get arbitrarily close to one another). We see some implications of these rules in our examples. Example 13.6 Consider the differential equation dy dt=f(y) =y\u0000y3. (13.5) Create a slope eld diagram for this differential equation. /facetime_videoA summary of steps in creating the slope eld for Example 13.6. Solution. Based on the last example, we focus on the sign, rather than the value of the derivative f(y), since that sign determines whether the solutions increase, decrease, or stay constant. Recall that factoring helps to nd zeros, and to identify where an expression changes sign. For example, dy dt=f(y) =y\u0000y3=y(1\u0000y2) =y(1+y)(1\u0000y). The sign of fdepends on the signs of the factors y,(1+y),(1\u0000y). For Mastered Material Check 15. Graph the function f(y) =y(1+y)(1\u0000y)and indiate where it changes sign. 16.

The sign of f(y)changes at each of the three points y=0,\u00061where one or another of the three factors changes sign,QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 283 as shown in Table 13.2. Eventually, to the right of all three (when y>1), the sign is negative.

We observe an agreement between the detailed solutions found analyt- ically (Example 12.5), found using Euler's method (Example 12.13), and those sketched using the new qualitative arguments (Example 13.7). State-space diagrams In Examples 13.5-13.7, we saw that we can understand qualitative features of solutions to the differential equation dy dt=f(y), (13.7) by examining the expression f(y). We used the sign of f(y)to assemble a slope eld diagram and sketch solution curves. The slope eld informed us about which initial values of ywould increase, decrease or stay constant. We next show another way of determining the same information. First, let us dene a state space , also called phase line , which is essen- tially the y-axis with superimposed arrows representing the direction of flow. Denition 13.2 (State space (or phase line)) A line representing the depen- dent variable ( y) together with arrows to describe the flow along that line (increasing, decreasing, or stationary y) satisfying Eqn. (13.7) is called the state space diagram or the phase line diagram for the differential equation. Rather than tabulating signs for f(y), we can arrive at similar conclusions by sketching f(y)and observing where this function is positive (implying thatyincreases) or negative ( ydecreases). Places where f(y) =0(\"zeros off\") are important since these represent steady states (\"static solutions\", where there is no change in y). Along the yaxis (which is now on the hori- zontal axis of the sketch) increasing ymeans motion to the right, decreasing y means motion to the left. As we shall see, the information contained in this type of diagram pro- vides a qualitative description of solutions to the differential equation, but with the explicit time behaviour suppressed. This is illustrated by Figure 13.4, where we show the connection between the slope eld diagram and the state space diagram for a typical differential equation.QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER /arrownortheast/upslope/upslope/upslope/upslope /arrowsoutheast/downslope/downslope/downslope/downslopey ty yf(y) (a) (b) (c) Figure 13.4: The relationship of the slope eld and state space diagrams. (a) A typical slope eld. A few arrows have been added to indicate the direction of time flow along the tangent vectors. Now consider \"looking down the time axis\" as shown by the \"eye\" in this diagram. Then the taxis points towards us, and we see only the y-axis as in (b). Arrows on the y-axis indicate the directions of flow for various values of y as determined in (a). Now \"rotate\" the y axis so it is horizontal, as shown in (c). The direction of the arrows exactly correspond to places where f(y), in (c), is positive (which implies increasing y,!), or negative (which implies decreasing y, ). The state space diagram is the y-axis in (b) or (c).Example 13.8 Consider the differential equation dy dt=f(y) =y\u0000y3. (13.8) Sketch f(y)versus yand use your sketch to determine where yis static, and where yincreases or decreases. Then describe what this predicts starting from each of the three initial conditions: (i)y(0) =\u00000.5, (ii)y(0) =0.3, or (iii) y(0) 13.6, we know that f(y) =0aty=\u00001,0,1. This /facetime_videoVideo explanation of the steps in the solution to Example 13.8.means that ydoes not change at these steady state values, so, if we start a system off with y(0) =0, ory(0) =\u00061, the value of yis static. The three places at which this happens are marked by heavy dots in Figure 13.5(a). yf(y) yf(y) (a) (b) Figure 13.5: Steady states (dots) and intervals for which yincreases or decreases for the differential equation (13.8) . See Example 13.8. We also see that f(y)<0for\u00001<y<0and for y>1. In these intervals, y(t)must be a decreasing function of time ( dy/dt<0). On the other hand, for286 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI CES 0<y<1or for y<\u00001, we have f(y)>0, soy(t)is increasing. See arrows on Figure 13.5(b). We see from this gure that there is a tendency for yto move away from the steady state value y=0and to approach either of the steady states at 1 or \u00001. Starting from the initial values given above, we have (i)y(0) =\u00000.5 results in y!\u0000 1, (ii)y(0) (iii) y(0) =2 implies y!1. \u0006 Example 13.9 (A cooling object) Sketch the same type of diagram for the problem of a cooling object and interpret its meaning.

The steady state at which f(y) =0is at y=a/b. Starting from an initial condition y(0) =a/b, there would be no change. We also see from this gure that yapproaches this value over time. After a long time, the value of ywill be approximately a/b. \u0006 a byf(y) Figure 13.7: Qualitative sketch for Eqn. (13.10) in Example 13.10.Steady states and stability From the last few gures, we observe that wherever the function fon the right hand side of the differential equations crosses the horizontal axis (satises f=0) there is a steady state. For example, in Figure 13.6 this takes place at T=10. At that temperature the differential equation species that dT/dt=0and so, T=10is a steady state, a concept we rst encountered in Chapter 12. Denition 13.3 (Steady state) A steady state is a state in which a system is not changing. Example 13.11 Identify steady states of Eqn. (13.8) , dy dt=y3\u0000y.QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 287 Solution. Steady states are points that satisfy f(y) =0. We already found those to be y=0 and y=\u00061 in Example 13.8. \u0006 From Figure 13.5, we see that solutions starting close to y=1tend to get closer and closer to this value. We refer to this behaviour as stability of the steady state. Denition 13.4 (Stability) We say that a steady state is stable if states that are initially close enough to that steady state will get closer to it with time. We say that a steady state is unstable , if states that are initially very close to it eventually move away from that steady state. Example 13.12 Determine the stability of steady states of Eqn. (13.8) : dy dt=y\u0000y3. Mastered Material Check 21. In the state space diagram in Figure 13.4, identify the stable steady states.Solution. From any starting value of y>0in this example, we see that after a long time , the solution curves tend to approach the value y=1. States close to y=1get closer to it, so this is a stable steady state. For the steady state y=0, we see that initial conditions near y=0move away over time. Thus, this steady state is unstable. Similarly, the steady state at y=\u00001is stable. In Figure 13.5 we show the stable steady states with black dots and the unstable steady state with an open dot. \u0006 13.3 Applying qualitative analysis to biological models Section 13.3 Learning goals 1.Practice the techniques of slope eld, state-space diagram, and steady state analysis on the logistic equation. 2.Explain the derivation of a model for interacting (healthy, infected) individuals based on a set of assumptions. 3.Identify that the resulting set of two ODEs can be reduced to a single ODE. Use qualitative methods to analyse the model behaviour and to interpret the results. The qualitative ideas developed so far will now be applied to to problems from biology. In the following sections we rst use these methods to obtain a thorough understanding of logistic population growth . We then derive a model for the spread of a disease, and use qualitative arguments to analyze the predictions of that differential equation model. Qualitative analysis of the logistic equation We apply the new methods to the logistic equation.288 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example 13.13 Find the steady states of the logistic equation, Eqn.

(13.1) , i.e. the level of population that would not change over time, we look for values of Nsuch that dN dt=0. This leads to rN(K\u0000N) K=0, which has solutions N=0(no population at all) or N=K(the population is at its carrying capacity). \u0006 We could similarly nd steady states of the scaled form of the logistic equation, Eqn.

This comes as no surprise since these values of ycorrespond to the values N=0 and N=K./facetime_videoA second way to analyze the scaled logistic equation, using the phase line approach, and its connection to the slope eld method as described in Example 13.14.

Circle the steady states in Figure 13.8 and identify which one is stable. 23. Why is y<0 not relevant in Example 13.14?Solution. In the plot of Figure 13.8 only y\u00150is relevant. In the interval 0<y<1, the rate of change is positive, so that yincreases, whereas for y>1, the rate of change is negative, so ydecreases. Since yrefers to population size, we need not concern ourselves with behaviour for y<0. 1ydy/dtRate of change Figure 13.8: Plot of dy/dtversus yfor the the scaled logistic equation (13.3).From Figure 13.8 we deduce that solutions that start with a positive y value approach y=1with time. Solutions starting at either steady state y=0 ory=1would not change. Restated in terms of the variable N(t), any initial population should approach its carrying capacity Kwith time. \u0006 We now look at the same equation from the perspective of the slope eld.

How do we know that initial conditions in the range 0 <y0<1 lead to increasing solutions?dy dt=ry(1\u0000y) =ry\u0000ry2 Differentiate both sides using the chain rule and factor, to get d2y dt2=rdy dt\u00002rydy dt=rdy dt(1\u00002y).290 THE LI FE SCIEN CES An inflection point would occur at places where the second derivative changes sign. This is possible for dy/dt=0or for (1\u00002y) =0. We have already dismissed the rst possibility because we argued that the rate of change is nonzero in the interval of interest. Thus we conclude that an inflection point would occur whenever y=1/2. Any initial condition satis- fying 0<y0<1/2would eventually pass through y=1/2on its way to the steady state level at y=1, and in so doing, would have an inflection point. \u0006 A changing aphid population In Chapters 1 and 5, we investigated a situation when predation and growth rates of an aphid population exactly balanced. But what happens if these two rates do not balance? We are now ready to tackle this question. Hint: Growth rate (number of aphids born per unit time) contributes positively, whereas predation rate (number of aphids eaten per unit time) contributes negatively to the rate of change of aphids with respect to time (dx/dt).Featured Problem 13.1 (aphids) Consider the aphid-ladybug problem (Example 1.3) with aphid density x, growth rate G(x) =rx, and predation rate by a ladybug P(x)as in (1.10) . (a) Write down a differential equation for the aphid population. (b) Use your equation, and a sketch of the two functions to answer the following question: What happens to the aphid population starting from various initial population sizes? 13.3.1 The radius of a growing cell In Section 11.4 we examined a cell in which nutrient absorption and con- sumption each contribute to changing the mass balance of the cell. We rst wrote down a differential equation of the form dm dt=A\u0000C. Assuming the cell was spherical, we showed that this equation results in the differential equation for the cell radius r(t): dr dt=1 r\u0012 k1\u0000k2 3r\u0013 ,k1,k2,r>0 (13.12) Using tools in this chapter, we can now understand what this implies about cell size growth. Featured Problem 13.2 (How cell radius changes) Apply qualitative methods to Eqn. (13.12) so as to determine what happens to cells starting from various initial sizes. Is there a steady state cell size? How do your results compare to our ndings in Section 1.2? A model for the spread of a disease In the era of human immunodeciency virus (HIV), Severe Acute Respira- tory Syndrome (SARS), Avian influenza (\"bird flu\") and similar emergingQUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 291 infectious diseases, it is prudent to consider how infection spreads, and how it could be controlled or suppressed. This motivates the following example. For a given disease, let us subdivide the population into two classes: healthy individuals who are susceptible to catching the infection, and those that are currently infected and able to transmit the infection to others. We consider an infection that is mild enough that individuals recover at some constant rate, and that they become susceptible once recovered. Note: usually, recovery from an illness leads to partial temporary immunity. While this, too, can be modelled, we restrict attention to the simpler case which is tractable using mathematics we have just introduced. The simplest case to understand is that of a xed population (with no birth, death or migration during the timescale of interest). A goal is to predict whether the infection spreads and persists (becomes endemic) in the population or whether it runs its course and disappear. We use the following /facetime_videoA video summary of the model for the spread of a disease, together with its analysis.notation: S(t) =size of population of susceptible (healthy) individuals, I(t) of population of infected individuals, N(t) =S(t) +I(t) =total population size. We add a few simplifying assumptions. 1.The population mixes very well, so each individual is equally likely to contact and interact with any other individual. The contact is random. 2.Other than the state ( SorI), individuals are \"identical,\" with the same rates of recovery and infectivity. 3.On the timescale of interest, there is no birth, death or migration, only exchange between SandI. Example 13.18 Suppose that the process can be represented by the scheme S+I!I+I, I!S The rst part, transmission of disease from ItoSinvolves interaction. The second part is recovery. Use the assumptions above to track the two popula- tions and to formulate a set of differential equations for I (t)and S(t). Solution. The following balance equations keeps track of individuals 2 64Rate of change of I(t)3 75=2 64Rate of gain due to disease transmission3 75\u00002 64Rate of loss due to recovery3 75 According to our assumption, recovery takes place at a constant rate per unit time, denoted by m>0. By the law of mass action, the disease transmission292 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES rate should be proportional to the product of the populations, (S\u0001I). Assigning b>0to be the constant of proportionality leads to the following differential equations for the infected population: dI dt=bSI\u0000mI. Similarly, we can write a balance equation that tracks the population of susceptible individuals: 2 64Rate of change of S(t)3 75=\u00002 64Rate of Loss due to disease transmission3 75+2 64Rate of gain due to recovery3 75 Observe that loss from one group leads to (exactly balanced) gain in the other group. By similar logic, the differential equation for S(t)is then dS dt=\u0000bSI+mI. We have arrived at a system of equations that describe the changes in each of the groups, dI dt=bSI\u0000mI, (13.13a) dS dt=\u0000bSI+mI. (13.13b) \u0006Mastered Material Check 26. Identify any constants in Eqns. (13.13)(a) and (b). 27. What are the units of those constants? 28. Why does the hint given in Example 13.19 help? From Eqns. (13.13) it is clear that changes in one population depend on both, which means that the differential equations are coupled (linked to one another). Hence, we cannot \"solve one\" independently of the other. We must treat them as a pair. However, as we observe in the next examples, we can simplify this system of equations using the fact that the total population does not change. Example 13.19 Use Eqns. (13.13) to show that the total population does not change ( hint: show that the derivative of S (t) +I(t)is zero). /facetime_videoVideo showing that the population N(t) =I(t) +S(t)is constant. Solution. Add the equations to one I(t) +S(t)] = N=constant, so the total population does not change. (In Eqn. (13.1) , here Nis a constant and I(t),S(t)are the variables.) \u0006 Example 13.20 Use the fact that Nis constant to express S(t)in terms ofI(t)andN, and eliminate S(t)from the differential equation for I(t). Your equation should only contain the constants N, b,m.QUA LITATIVE METHO DS FOR DIFFER ENTIA L EQUATI ONS 293 Mastered Material Check 29. Redo Example 13.20 but eliminate I(t)instead of S(t). 30. Analyze the equation you get for dS(t)/dtas done for dI/dtin Example 13.21.Solution. Since N=S(t) +I(t)is constant, we can write S(t) =N\u0000I(t). Then, plugging this into the differential equation for I(t)we obtain dI dt=bSI\u0000mI,)dI dt=b(N\u0000I)I\u0000mI. \u0006 Example 13.21 a) Show that the above equation can be written in the form dI dt=bI(K\u0000I), where K is a constant. b)Determine how this constant K depends on N ,b,andm. c)Is the constant K positive or negative? Solution. a)We rewrite the differential N\u0015m b)K\u00150, N<m b)K<0. \u0006 Using the above process, we have reduced the system of two differential equations for the two variables I(t),S(t)to asingle differential equation forI(t), together with the statement S(t) =N\u0000I(t). We now examine implications of this result using the qualitative methods of this chapter. Example 13.22 Consider the differential equation for I (t)given =bI(K\u0000I),where K =\u0012 N\u0000m b\u0013 . Find the steady states of the differential equation (13.14) and draw a state space diagram in each of the following cases: (a)K\u00150, (b)K<0.294 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Use your diagram to determine which steady state(s) are stable or unstable. Mastered Material Check 31. What is the signicance of the grey shaded regions in Fig. 13.10. 32. Draw Fig. 13.10 for K=0. 33. Why is I=Knot an admissible steady state if K<0?Solution. Steady states of Eqn. (13.14) satisfy dI/dt=bI(K\u0000I) =0. Hence, these steady states are I=0(no infected individuals) and I=K. The latter only makes sense if K\u00150. We plot the function f(I) =bI(K\u0000I)in Eqn. (13.14) against the state variable for K\u00150and (b) forK<0. Since f(I)is quadratic in I, its graph is a parabola and it opens downwards. We add arrows pointing right ( !) in the regions where dI/dt>0 and arrows pointing left ( ) where 0KIf(I) differential equation (13.14) . Plots of f(I) as a function of Iin the cases (a) K\u00150, and (b) K<0. The grey regions are not biologically meaningful since Icannot be negative. In case (a), when K\u00150, we nd that arrows point toward I=K, so this steady state is stable. Arrows point away from I=0, so this represents an unstable steady state. In case (b), while we still have a parabolic graph with two steady states, the state I=Kis not admissible since Kis negative. Hence only one steady state, at I=0is relevant biologically, and all initial conditions move towards this state. \u0006 Example 13.23 Interpret the results of the model in terms of the disease, assuming that initially most of the population is in the susceptible Sgroup, and a small number of infected individuals are present at t =0. Solution. In case (a), as long as the initial size of the infected group is positive ( I>0), with time it approaches K, that is, I(t)!K=N\u0000m/b. The rest of the population is in the susceptible group, that is S(t)!m/b(so that S(t) +I(t) =Nis always constant.) This rst scenario holds provided K>0 which is equivalent to N>m/b. There are then some infected and some healthy individuals in the population indenitely, according to the model. In this case, we say that the disease becomes endemic . In case (b), which corresponds to N<m/b, we see that I(t)!0regardless of the initial size of the infected group. In that case, S(t)!Nso with time, the infected group shrinks and the healthy group grows so that the whole population becomes healthy. From these two results, we conclude that the disease is wiped out in a small population, whereas in a sufciently large population, it can spread until a steady state is attained where some fraction of the population is always infected. In fact we have identied a threshold that separates these two behaviours:Mastered Material Check 34. In the case that b=0.001per person per day and m=0.1 per day, how large would the population have to be for the disease to become endemic? 35.

Many current and much more detailed models for disease transmission also have such threshold behaviour, and the ratio that determines whether the disease spreads or disappears, R0is of great interest in vaccination strategies. This ratio represents the number of infections that arise when 1 infected individual interacts with a population ofNsusceptible individuals. 13.4 Summary 1.A differential equation of the form ady dt+by+g=0is linear (and \"rst order\"). We encountered several examples of nonlinear DEs in this chapter. 2.A (possibly nonlinear) differential equationdy dt=f(y)can be analyzed qualitatively by observing where f(y)is positive, negative or zero. 3.A slope eld (or \"direction eld\") is a collection of tangent vectors for solutions to a differential equation. Slope elds can be sketched from f(y) without the need to solve the differential equation. 4.A solution curve drawn in a slope eld corresponds to a single solution to a differential equation, with some initial y0value given. 5.A state space (or \"phase line\" diagram) for the differential equation is a y axis, together with arrows describing the flow (increasing/decreasing/stationary) along that axis. It can be obtained from a sketch of f(y). 6.A steady state is stable if nearby states get closer. A steady state is unsta- ble if nearby states get further away with time. 7.Creating/interpreting slope eld and state space diagrams is helpful in understanding the behavior of solutions to differential equations. 8.

The Law of Mass Action in Section 13.1 led to the assumption that the rate of a reaction involving two types of molecules (A and B) is proportional to the product of their concentra- tions, k\u0001a\u0001b. Explain why the sum of the concentrations, k\u0001(a+b)would not make for a sensible assumption about the rate of the reaction. 13.11. Biochemical reaction.

Consider a sh population of density N(t)growing at rate g(N), with harvesting, so that the population satises the differential equation dN dt=g(N)\u0000h(N). Now assume that the growth rate is logistic, so g(N) =rN(K\u0000N) K where r,K>0are constant. Assume that the rate of harvesting is proportional to the population size, so that h(N) =qEN where E, the effort of the shermen, and q, the catchability of this type of sh, are positive constants. Use qualitative methods discussed in this chapter to analyze the behaviour of this equation. Under what conditions does this lead to a sustainable shery? 13.13. Logistic growth with constant number harvesting. Consider the same sh population as in Exercise 12, but this time assume that the rate of harvesting is xed, regardless of the population size, so that h(N) =H300 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES where His a constant number of sh being caught and removed per unit time. Analyze this revised model and compare it to the previous results. 13.14. Scaling time in the logistic equation. Consider the scaled logistic equation (13.3) . Recall that rhas units of 1/time, so 1/ris a quantity with units of time. Now consider scaling the time variable in (13.3) by dening t=s/r. Then scarries no units ( sis \"dimensionless\"). Substitute this expression for tin(13.3) and nd the differential equation so obtained (for dy/ds). 13.15. Euler's method applied to logistic growth. Consider the logistic differential equation dy dt=ry(1\u0000y). Letr=1. Use Euler's method to nd a solution to this differential equation starting with y(0) =0.5, and step size h=0.2. Find the values ofyup to time t=1.0. 13.16. Spread of infection. In the model for the spread of a disease, we used the fact that the total population is constant ( S(t)+I(t) =N=constant) to eliminate S(t)and analyze a differential equation for I(t)on its own. Carry out a similar analysis, but eliminate I(t). Then analyze the differential equation you get for S(t)to nd its steady states and behaviour, practicing the qualitative analysis discussed in this chapter. 13.17. Vaccination strategy. When an individual is vaccinated, he or she is \"removed\" from the susceptible population, effectively reducing the size of the population that can participate in the disease transmission. For example, if a fraction fof the population is vaccinated, then only the remaining (1\u0000f)Nindividuals can be either susceptible or infected, so S(t) +I(t) = ( 1\u0000f)N. When smallpox was an endemic disease, it had a basic reproductive number of R0=7. What fraction of the population would have had to be vaccinated to eradicate this disease? 13.18. Social media. Sally Sweetstone has invented a new social media App called HeadSpace, which instantly matches compatible mates according to their changing tastes and styles. Users hear about the App from one another by word of mouth and sign up for an account. The account expires randomly, with a half-life of 1month.

Perhaps most familiar is the continually repeating heartbeat that accompanies us through life. Electrically active muscles power the heart. That electrical activity can be recorded on the surface of the body by an electrocardiogram (ECG), as shown in Figure 14.1. In a normal healthy human at rest, the electrical activity pattern associated with a complete cycle repeats itself with roughly 1 heartbeat per second. At exercise, the beating heart pumps faster, so the pattern repeats more frequently. Figure 14.1: An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the pattern of electrical activity of the heart. Vertical axis: millivolts, horizontal axis: time in seconds. At rest (top), the heart beats approximately 60 times per minute, but in exercise (lower trace), the heart rate increases.To study the behaviour shown in Figure 14.1, we must rst develop language that describes such periodic phenomena. For example, we need to quantify what is meant by \"more frequent repetition\" of a heart beat, \"skipping a beat,\" or other shifts in the pattern of this or of any other cycling system. Before trying to understand intricate examples such as ECG's, we begin with simple prototypes of periodic functions: the trigonometric functions , sine andcosine . Belonging to a wider class of periodic functions, these cases illustrate ideas of amplitude ,frequency ,period , and phase . Many cyclic phenomena can be described approximately by suitably adjusting such basic functions. Our study in this elementary context then aids in the goal of analyzing periodic functions in general - and periodicity of the ECG's in particular (we return to this in Example 14.2). As a second theme, we return to inverse functions and show that restric- tions must be applied to ensure the existence of an inverse, particularly for trigonometric functions. Then, in Chapter 15, we calculate the derivatives of trigonometric functions and explore applications to rates of change of periodic phenomena or changing angles.304 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 14.1 Basic trigonometry Section 14.1 Learning goals 1. Dene radian as a measure for angles. 2.Describe the correspondence between a point moving on a unit circle and the sine and cosine of the angle it forms at the origin. 3.Make correspondence between ratios of sides of a Pythagorean triangle and the trigonometric functions of one of its angles. 4.Review properties of the functions sin(x)andcos(x)and other trigono- metric functions. State and apply the connections between these functions (\"trigonometric identities\"). Trigonometric functions are closely associated with angles and ratios of sides of a right-angle triangle. They are also connected to the motion of a point moving around a unit circle. Before we articulate these connections, we must agree on a universal way of measuring angles. Angles and circles Angles can be measured in a number of ways. One is to assign a value in degrees , with the convention that one complete revolution is represented by 360\u000e. It turns out that this measure is not particularly convenient, and we instead replace it with a more universal quantity. Our denition of angles will be based on the fact that circles of all sizes have one common geometric feature: they have the same ratio of circumfer- ence, to diameter, no matter what their size (or where in the universe they occur). We call that ratio p, that is p=Circumference of circle Diameter of circle. Diameter, D Circumference, CRadius, RFigure 14.2: Circumference, diameter and radius of a circle. By construction, the diameter Dof a circle is a distance that corresponds to twice the radius Rof that circle, so D=2R. This leads to the familiar relationship of circumference C, to radius R, C=2pR. This statement is merely a denition of the constant p. As shown in Figure 14.3, an angle qcan be put into correspondence with an arc along the edge of a circle. For a circle of radius Rand angle qwe dene the arclength, Sby the relation S=Rqwhere qis measured in a RS Figure 14.3: The angle qin radians is related to the radius Rof the circle, and the length of the arc Sby the simple formula, S=Rq.PERI ODI C AND TRI GONO METR IC FU NCTI ONS 305 convenient way that we now select. Both SandRcarry units of \"distance\" or \"length\". But their ratio is, q=S R, so the units in numerator and denominator cancel, and the angle qisdimen- sionless (carries no units). Mastered Material Check 1. What angle qcorresponds to a 1/6 revolution around the perimeter of a circle? 2. Sketch an angle of p/4 radians. 3. If the radius of a circle is 2 and an arc on its perimeter has length 0.5, what is the angle corresponding to that arc (in radians)?Now consider a circle of radius R=1(called a unit circle ) and denote by s a length of arc around the entire perimeter of this unit circle. Then q=s 1. In particular, for one complete revolution around the circle, the arclength is s=2p\u00011=2p, which is just the circumference of the unit circle. In that case, it makes sense to consider the angle corresponding to one revolution as q=2p 1=2p. This leads naturally to the denition of the radian :we identify an angle of 2pradians with one complete revolution around the circle . Note that (like degrees or other measures of angles), a radian is a number that carries no \"units\". We can now use this measure for angles to assign values to any frac- tion of a revolution, and thus, to any angle. For example, an angle of 90\u000e corresponds to one quarter of a revolution around the perimeter of a unit circle, so we identify the angle p/2radians with it. One degree is 1/360of a revolution, corresponding to 2 p/360 radians, and so on. We summarize the properties of radians: 1.The length of an arc along the perimeter of a circle of radius Rcorre- sponding to an angle qbetween radians. 2.An angle is the ratio of the arclength it subtends in a circle to the radius of that circle (and hence, a radian carries no units). 3.One complete revolution, or one full cycle corresponds to an angle of 2p radians. We can convert between degrees and radians by remembering that 360\u000e corresponds to 2pradians ( 180\u000ethen corresponds to pradians, 90\u000etop/2 radians, etc.) Mastered Check 4.

We dene the functions sine and cosine, both dependent on the angle t (abbreviated sin (t)and cos (t)) as follows: sin(t) =y 1=y, cos (t) 1=x That is, the function sine tracks the ycoordinate of the point as it moves around the unit circle, and the function cosine tracks its x coordinate. /_481A demonstration of the link between motion on a circle and the function y=sin(x).

This means that the xcoordinate of any point (x,y)on the unit circle cannot be larger than 1or smaller than\u00001. The same holds for the ycoordinate.

The maximum value of each function is 1, the minimum is\u00001, and the average is 0. We adopt the convention that when the radius vector points along the x-axis, the angle is t=0, and coordinates of the point are x=1,y=0. This implies that cos (0) =1, sin(0) =0. When the radius vector points up the y-axis, the angle is p/2(correspond- ing to one quarter of a complete revolution), and coordinates of the point arex=0,y=1 so that cos (p/2) =0,sin(p/2) =1.PERI ODI C AND TRI GONO METR IC FU NCTI ONS 307 Through geometry, we can also determine the lengths of all sides - and hence the ratios of the sides - of particular triangles, namely -equilateral triangles (in which all angles are 60\u000e), and -right triangles (two equal angles of 45\u000e). These types of calculations (omitted here) lead to some easily determined values for the sine and cosine of such special angles. These are shown in Table F.1 of the Appendix F.Mastered Material Check 6. Review Appendix F and then use triangles to determine the xandy coordinates of angles of 60\u000e and 45\u000ein the unit circle. 7. Why does cosine have its largest value when the angle t=0, at the beginning of the cycle?Characteristics of sine and cosine. Both sin(t)andcos(t)go through the same values every time the angle t completes another cycle around the circle. We refer to such functions as periodic functions. The two functions, sine and cosine depict the same underlying motion, viewed from two perspectives: cos(t)represents the projection of the circularly moving point onto the x-axis, while sin(t)is the projection of the same point onto the y-axis. In this sense, the functions are \"twins\", and as such we expect many relationships connecting them. The cosine has its largest value at the beginning of the cycle, when t=0 (since cos(0) =1), while sine has its peak value a little later ( sin(p/2) = 1). Throughout their circular race, the sine function is p/2radians ahead of the cosine, that is, cos(t) =sin\u0010 t+p 2\u0011 . See Figure 14.5 for graphs of both functions showing this shift by p/2. Theperiod Tof the sine function sin(t)is dened as the value of tfor which one whole cycle (around the circle) has been completed. Ac- cordingly, this period is T=2p. Similarly the period of the cosine function cos (t)is also 2 p. (See Figure 14.5.) The point (x,y) = ( cos(t),sin(t))is on a circle of radius 1, and, thus, its coordinates satisfy x2+y2=1. This implies that sin2(t) +cos2(t) =1 (14.1) for any angle t. This is an important relation, (also called a trigonometric identity ), and one that is frequently used. See Appendix F for a review of other trigonometric identities. The sine and cosine functions have symmetries that we already encoun- tered: sin(t)is an odd function (symmetric about the origin) and the cos(t)is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis). These symme- tries also imply that sin (\u0000t) =cos(t).308 DI FFERENTI SCIEN CES y=sin(t) 1 0 1t period,T 2 3 4 23 25 2 y=cos(t) 1 0 1t period,T 2 3 23 25 2 Figure 14.5: Periodicity of the sine and cosine.

Here we formalize the denition of a periodic function, dene its period, frequency, and other properties. Denition 14.1 (Periodic function) A function is said to be periodic if f(t) =f(t+T), where Tis a constant that we call the period of the function. Graphically, this means that if we shift the function by a constant \"distance\" along the horizontal axis, we see the same picture again. Make demo? Example 14.1 Show that the trigonometric functions are indeed periodic. Mastered Material Check 8. If cos (a) =b, what is cos(a+2p)? cos(a\u00006p)?Solution. The point (x,y)in Figure 14.4 repeats its trajectory every time a revolution around the circle is complete. This happens when the angle t completes one full cycle of 2pradians. Thus, as expected, the trigonometric functions are periodic, that is sin(t) =sin(t+2p), and cos (t) =cos(t+2p). Similarly tan(t) =tan(t+2p), and cot (t) =cot(t+2p). We say that the period of these functions is T=2pradians. The same applies to sec (t)and csc (t), that is, all six trigonometric functions are periodic. \u0006 Phase, amplitude, and frequency/_481Use the sliders on this desmos graph to see how the amplitude, A, frequency w, and phase faffect the graph of the function y=M+Asin(w(t\u0000f)). You can also vary the mean value M. In Appendix C we review how the appearance of any function changes when wetransform variables. For example, replacing the independent variable x byx\u0000a(orax) shifts (or scales) the function horizontally, multiplying fby a constant Cscales the function vertically, etc. The same ideas apply to shapes of a trigonometric function when similar transformations are applied.Mastered Material Check 9.

What is the frequency of a trigonometric functions whose period is 1 hr? If we examine a graph of the function y=f(t) =Asin(w(t\u0000a)), we nd that the basic sine graph has been shifted in the positive tdirection by a, as in Figure 14.6(d). At time t=a, the value of the function is y=f(t) =Asin(w(a\u0000a)) = Asin(0) =0, so the cycle \"starts\" with a delay of t=arelative to the basic sine function.Mastered Material Check 15. Sketch a graph of y=3sin(t\u0000p 2) andy=3cos(t) 16. Sketch a graph of y=cos(4(t\u0000p)) Another common variant of the same function can be written in the form y=f(t) =Asin(wt\u0000f). Here fis called the phase shift of the oscillation. The above two forms are the same if we identify fwith wa. The phase shift, fhas no units, whereas a has units of time, which is the same as the units of t. When f=2p, (whichPERI ODI C AND TRI GONO METR IC FU NCTI ONS 311 happens when a=2p/w), the graph has been moved over to the right by one full period, making it identical to the original periodic graph. Some of the scaled, shifted, sine functions described here are shown in Figure 14.6. The periodic electrocardiogram With the terminology of periodic function in place, we can now describe the ECG pattern for both normal resting individuals and those at exercise. Figure 14.7: One full ECG cycle (left) has been \"wrapped around a circle\".Recall that at rest, the heart beats approximately once per second. Con- sider the ECG trace on the left of Figure 14.7. This corresponds to a single heartbeat, and so, takes 1second from start to nish. Suppose trepresents time in seconds, and let y=f(t)represent the electrical activity (in mV) at time t. Then, since this pattern repeats, the function fis periodic, with period T=1 second. We can write f(t) =f(t+1),tin seconds. However, suppose the individual starts running. Then this relationship no longer holds, since heartbeats become more frequent, and the length of their period, T, decreases. This suggests a more natural way to mark off time - the amount of time it takes to complete a heartbeat cycle. Thus, rather than seconds, we dene a such a variable, denoting it \"the cycle time\" and use the notation \u00aft. Then the connection between clock time tand cycle time is t=time in seconds =number of cycles\u0001length of 1 cycle in sec =\u00aft\u0001T Restated, Mastered Material Check 17. If a runner's heart beats every 0.6 seconds, how many beat cycles ellapse in 10 seconds? 18. Suppose t=4 sec and \u00aft=5. Determine Tand interpret this situation.\u00aft=t T. Note: the \"number of cycles\" need not be an integer - for example, \u00aft=2.75 means that we are 3 /4 way into the third electrical activity cycle. Since fis a periodic function, we can \"join up\" its two ends and \"wrap it around a circle\", as shown in the schematic on Figure 14.7. Then successive heartbeats are depicted by traversing the circle over and over again. This suggests identifying the beginning of a cycle with 0 and the end of a cycle with 2 p. To do so, we revise our cycle time clock as follows. Dene t=number of radians traversed since time 0. Then every heartbeat corresponds to this clock adding an increment of 2p. The connection between this cycle clock and time tin seconds is t=2p\u00aft=2pt T(14.2) (We check that when 1 cycle is complete, t=Tandt=2p, as desired.) We can now describe the periodicity of the ECG in terms of the cycle clock by the formula f(t) =f(t+2p). (14.3)312 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES As a check, we show in the next example that the relationship in Eqn. (14.3) reduces to the familiar period and frequency notation in terms of our original time tin seconds. Example 14.2 (Period and frequency of heartbeat) Use the formula we arrived at for tand its connection to clock time tto transform back to time t in seconds. Express the periodicity of the function fboth in terms of the period T and the frequency wof heartbeats. Solution. Start with Eqn. (14.3), f(t) =f(t+2p). Substitute t=2pt/Tfrom Eqn. (14.3) and simplify f\u00122pt T\u0013 =f\u00122pt T+2p\u0013 =f\u00122p T(t+T)\u0013 . We now rewrite in terms of the frequency w=2p/Tto arrive at f(wt)=f(w(t+T)). This relationship holds for any regular heartbeat, whether at rest or exercise where the frequency of the heartbeat, w, is related to the period (duration of 1 beat cycle) by w=2p/T. \u0006 Rhythmic processes Many natural phenomena are cyclic. It is sometimes convenient to represent such phenomena with a simple periodic functions, such as sine or cosine. Given some periodic process, we determine its frequency (or period), ampli- tude, and phase shift. We create a trigonometric function (sine or cosine) that approximates the desired behaviour. To select a function, it helps to remember that (at t=0) cosine starts at its peak, while sine starts at its average value of 0. A function that starts at the lowest point of the cycle is \u0000cos(t). In most cases, the choice of sine or cosine to represent the cyclic phenomenon is arbitrary, they are related by a simple phase shift. Next, pick a constant wsuch that the trigonometric function sin(wt) (orcos(wt)) has the correct period using the relationship w=2p/T. We then select the amplitude, and horizontal and vertical shifts to complete the process. The examples below illustrate this process.PERI ODI C AND TRI GONO METR IC FU NCTI ONS 313 Example 14.3 (Daylight hours:) In Vancouver, the shortest day (8 hours of light) occurs around December 22, and the longest day (16 hours of light) is around June 21. Approximate the cyclic changes of daylight through the season using the sine function. Solution. On Sept 21 and March 21 the lengths of day and night are equal, and then there are 12 hours of daylight (each of these days is called an equinox ). Suppose we identify March 21 as the beginning of a yearly day- night length cycle. Let tbe time in days beginning on March 21. One full cycle takes a year, i.e. 365 days. The period of the function we want is thus T=365 and its frequency (in units of per day) is w=2p/365. Daylight shifts between the two extremes of 8 and 16 hours: i.e. 12 \u00064 hours. This means that the amplitude of the cycle is 4 hours. The oscillation take place about the average value of 12 hours. We have decided to start a cycle on a day for which the number of daylight hours is the average value (12). This means that the sine would be most appropriate, so the function that best describes the number of hours of daylight at different times of the year is: D(t) =12+4sin\u00122p 365t\u0013 where tis time in days and Dthe number of hours of light. \u0006Mastered Material Check 19. In August, the average number of daylight hours is 14. How does this t with our model? 20. Repeat Example 14.3 using a cosine function. Example 14.4 (Hormone levels) The level of a certain hormone in the bloodstream fluctuates between undetectable concentration at t=7:00 and 100 ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre) at t=19:00 hours. Approximate the cyclic variations in this hormone level with the appropriate periodic trigonometric function. Let t represent time in hours from 0:00 hrs through the day. Solution. We rst note that it takes one day (24 hours) to complete a cycle. This means that the period of oscillation is 24 hours, so that the frequency is w=2p T=2p 24=p 12. The level of hormone varies between 0 and 100 ng/ml, which can be ex- pressed as 50\u000650 ng/ml. (The trigonometric functions are symmetric cycles, and we are nding both the average value about which cycles occur and the amplitude of the cycles.) We could consider the time midway between the low and high points, namely 13:00 hours as the point corresponding to the upswing at the start of a cycle of the sine function. (See Figure 14.8 for the sketch.) Thus, if we use a sine to represent the oscillation, we should shift it by 13 hrs to the left. 100 50 0H(t) 1 7 13 19 24 1tperiod: T= 24 hrs 12 hrs 6 hrsFigure 14.8: Hormonal cycles. The full cycle takes 24 hrs (hence the period is T=24h and the frequency is w=2p/24 per hour). The level H(t)swings between 0 and 100 ng/ml. From the given information, we see that the average level is 50 ng/ml, and that the origin of a sine curve should be att=13(i.e. 1/4 of the cycle which is 6 hrs past the time point t=7).314 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Assembling these observations, we obtain the level of hormone, Hat time tin hours: H(t) =50+50sin\u0010p 12(t\u000013)\u0011 .

In this version, the quantity f=13p 12 is the phase shift. In selecting the periodic function to use for this example, we could have made other choices.

The horizontal axis is time in days, and the vertical axis represents P(t), the fraction of the moon that is visible from Earth on day t.Solution. The period of the cycle is T=29.5 days, so w=2p T=2p 29.5. LetP(t)be the fraction of the moon face on day tin the cycle. Then we should construct the function so that 0<P<1, with P=1in mid cycle (see Figure 14.9). The cosine function swings between the values -1 and 1. To obtain a positive function in the desired range for P(t), we add a constant and scale the cosine as follows: 1 2[1+cos(wt)]. This is still not quite right, since at t=0 this function takes the value 1, rather than 0, as shown in Figure 14.9. To correct this we can either introduce a phase shift, i.e. set P(t) =1 2[1+cos(wt+p)]. Then when t=0, we we can P(t) =1 2[1\u0000cos(wt)], which achieves the same result. \u0006Mastered Material Check 22.

If this is done, merely skip Sections 15.1 and 15.3. Section 14.3 Learning goals 1. Review inverse functions, and dene the inverse trigonometric functions. 2.Explain why the domain of a periodic function must be restricted to dene its inverse. Given any of the trigonometric functions, identify the suitably restricted domain on which an inverse function can be dened. 3.Simplify and/or interpret the meaning of expressions involving the trigono- metric and inverse trigonometric functions. Trigonometric functions provides another opportunity to illustrate the roles and properties of inverse functions. The inverse of a trigonometric function leads to exchange in the roles of the dependent and independent variables, as well as the the roles of the domain and range. Recall that geo- metrically, an inverse function is obtained by reflecting the original function about the line y=x. However, we must take care that the resulting graph rep- resents a true function, i.e. satises all the properties required of a function. Mastered Material Check 23. What property of a function might fail when we dene an inverse function? 24. Give an example of two different functions which are not one-to-one. 25. Why is the range of tan (x) \u0000\u00a5<y<\u00a5? Why are some points not in the domain?The domains of sin(x)andcos(x)are both\u0000\u00a5<x<\u00a5while their ranges are\u00001\u0014y\u00141. In the case of the function tan(x), the domain excludes values \u0006p/2as well as angles 2np\u0006p/2at which the function is undened. The range of tan (x)is\u0000\u00a5<y<\u00a5. There is one difculty in dening inverses for trigonometric functions: the fact that these functions repeat their values in a cyclic pattern means that a given yvalue is obtained from many possible values of x. For example, the values x=p/2,5p/2,7p/2, etc. all satisfy sin(x) =1. We say that these functions are not one-to-one . Geometrically, this means the graphs of the trigonometric functions intersect a horizontal line in numerous places. When these graphs are reflected about the line y=x, they would intersect avertical line in many places, and would fail to be functions: the function would have multiple yvalues corresponding to the same value of x, which is not allowed. See Appendix C where the inverse function for y=x2is discussed. /_481The trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions are shown. Turn the graphs on or off by clicking on the (grey) circles to the left of the formulae. Notice that each function and its inverse are reflections of one another about the liney=x. Also observe that the domain of the inverse functions is restricted, to avoid multiple yvalues for a given x value.To avoid this difculty, we restrict the domains of a trigonometric func- tions to a portion of their graphs that does not repeat. To do so, we select an interval over which the given trigonometric function is one-to-one, i.e. over which there is a unique correspondence between values of xand values of y. We then dene the corresponding inverse function, as described below. Arcsine is the inverse of sine. The function y=sin(x)is one-to-one on the316 DI FFERENTI LI FE SCIEN CES interval\u0000p/2\u0014x\u0014p/2.

Note that one is the reflection of the other about the line y=x. The graphs in parts (a) and (b) are not on the same scale. To interpret this function, we note that arcsin (x)is \"the angle (in radians) whose sine is x\". In Figure 14.11, we show a triangle in which q=arcsin (x). This follows from the observation that the sine of theta, opposite over hy- potenuse ( sinq=opp hypas reviewed in Appendix F) is x/1=x.

In the rst case, xis an angle whose sine we compute rst, and then reverse the procedure. In the second case, xis a number whose arc-sine is an angle. While we can evaluate arcsin (sin(x))for any value of x, the result may not agree with the original value of x- unless we restrict attention to the interval \u0000p/2\u0014x\u0014p/2.

Notice that x=2is outside of the interval \u00001\u0014x\u00141. Thus arcsin (2)is simply not dened, and so neither is sin (arcsin (x)).\u0006 Indeed, care must be taken in handling the inverse trigonometric functions. Inverse cosine. We cannot use the same interval (as that for sine) to restrict the cosine function because cos(x)is an even function, symmetric about theyaxis (and not one-to-one on the interval p/2\u0014x\u0014p/2).

Unlike the case for Sin(x), we must exclude the endpoints, where the function tan(x)is undened. We therefore restrict the domain to p/2<x<p/2, that is, we dene, y=Tan(x) =tan(x)p/2<x<p/2. Again in contrast to the sine function, as xapproaches either endpoint of this interval, the value of Tan(x)approaches\u0006\u00a5, i.e.\u0000\u00a5<Tan(x)<\u00a5. This means that the domain of the inverse function is \u0000\u00a5<x<\u00a5, i.e. the inverse function is dened for all real values of x.

A summary of the above inverse trigonometric functions, showing their graphs on a single page is provided in Figure F.3 in Appendix F. Some of the standard angles allow us to dene precise values for the inverse trig functions. A table of such standard values is given in the same Appendix (See Table F.2).

We compute derivatives, and then use these results in a medley of problems on optimization, related rates, and differential equations. 15.1 Derivatives of trigonometric functions Section 15.1 Learning goals 1.Use the denition of the derivative to calculate the derivatives of sin(x) and cos (x). 2.Using the quotient rule, compute derivatives of tan(x),sec(x),csc(x), and cot (x). 3.Using properties of the inverse trigonometric functions and implicit differentiation, calculate derivatives of arcsin (x), arccos (x), and arctan (x).

Note: the same two limits appear in this calculation, as well as the trigono- metric identity Eqn. (F.4). We can now calculate the derivative of the any of the other trigonometric functions using the quotient rule.

The volume of air in the lungs can be modelled by a function of the form V(t) =C+Asin(wt+f), where Vis the volume in millilitres (ml) and tis time in seconds. Suppose that the minimum and maximum volumes are 1400 and 3400 ml, respectively, and that the maximum rate of change of Vis 1200 ml/sec. What is the period of V(t)? Derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions Implicit differentiation - introduced in Chapter 9 - can be used to deter- mine the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions, explored in Section 14.3. As an example, we demonstrate how to compute the derivative ofarctan (x). To do so, we need to recall that the derivative of the func- tiontan(x)issec2(x). We also use the identity tan2(x) +1=sec2(x). (See Eqn. (F.1).) Lety=arctan (x).Then on the appropriate interval, we can replace this relationship with the equivalent one: tan(y) =x.

The examples in this section provide practice with chain rule applica- tions based on trigonometric functions. We discuss a number of problems, and show how the basic properties of these functions, together with some geometry, are used to arrive at desired results.

Determine the rate of change of the xandycoordinates of that point. Solution. We have q(t),x(t), and y(t)all functions of t. (The geometry is captured by Figure 14.4, but the angle has been renamed q, and we consider it to be time-dependent.) The fact that qis proportional to tmeans that dq dt=w. Thexandycoordinates of the point are related the by x(t) =cos(q(t)) = cos(wt), y(t) =sin(q(t)) = sin(wt).

If w=2 per min, what is the rate of change of the xandycoordinates when q=p/2?Example 15.4 (Runners on a circular track) Two runners start at the same position on a circular race track of length 400meters. Joe Runner takes 50sec, while Michael Johnson takes 43.18 sec to complete the 400me- ter race. Find the rate of change of the angle formed between the two runners and the center of the track, assuming that they run at a constant rate. Solution. We are told that the track is 400meters in length (total). However, this information does not actually enter into the solution. Joe completes one cycle around the track ( 2pradians) in 50 sec, while Michael completes a cycle in 43.18 sec. This means that Joe has a period of T1=50sec, and a frequency of w1=2p/T1=2p/50 radians per sec. Michael has period is T2=43.18 sec, and a frequency of w2=2p/T2= 2p/43.18 radians per sec. LetqJ,qMbe the angles subtended between one of the runners and the starting line. We take the x-axis as that starting line, by convention, as in Figure 14.4. From this, we nd sec. Thus, the angle between at the rate d(qM\u0000qJ) dt=dqM dt\u0000dqJ dt=0.145\u00000.125 =0.02 sec. \u0006 (Simple law of cosines) The law of cosines applies to an arbitrary triangle, as reviewed in Appendix F (see Eqn (F.2)). Consider the triangle shown in Figure 15.1. Suppose that the angle qincreases at a acb Figure 15.1: Law of cosines states that c2=a2+b2\u00002abcos(q).constant rate, dq/dt=k.

The law of cosines states that c2=a2+b2\u00002abcos(q). We identify the changing quantities by writing this relation in the form c2(t) =a2+b2\u00002abcos(q(t)) so it is evident that only candqvary with time, while a,bremain constant. Differentiating with respect to tand using the chain rule leads to: 2cdc At the instant in question, a=3,b=4, and c=5, forming a Pythagorean triangle in which the angle opposite cisq=p/2.

Solution. We call q1the angle that the minute hand subtends with the x-axis (horizontal direction) and q2the angle that the hour hand makes with the same axis as depicted in Figure 15.2(a). If our clock is working properly, each hand moves around at a con- stant rate. The hour hand traces one complete revolution ( 2pradians) ev- ery12hours, while the minute hand completes a revolution every hour. Both hands move in a clockwise direction, which (by convention) is towards negative angles. This means that dq1 dt=\u00002pradians per hour, dq2 dt=\u00002p 12radians per hour.

At what rate is the distance between the ends of the hands changing when it is 3:00 o'clock? Solution. We use the law of cosines on the triangle shown in Figure 15.2. Side lengths are a=3,b=4, and c(t)opposite the angle q(t). From the previous example, we have dc dt=ab csin(q)dq dt. At precisely 3:00 o'clock, the angle in question is q=p/2and it can also be seen that the Pythagorean triangle abcleads to c2=a2+b2=32+42=9+16=25 so that c=5.

Visual angles Example 15.8 (Visual angle) In the triangle shown in Figure 15.3, an object of height sis moving towards an observer. Its distance from the observer at some instant is labeled x(t)and it approaches at some constant speed, v. Determine the rate of change of the angle q(t)and how it depends on speed, size, and distance of the object. Often qis called a visual angle, since it represents the angle that an image subtends on the retina of the observer. /_481Demo of the changing visual angle. You can see how the angle depends on the size of the object s. Notice that the angle hardly changes when the object is far away, and changes dramatically as the object gets closer. (t) x(t)s Figure 15.3: A visual angle qwould change as the distance xdecreases. The size sis assumed constant. See Example 15.8.Solution. The object approaches at some constant speed, vso that dx dt=\u0000v. where the minus sign means that the distance xis decreasing. Using the trigonometric relations, we see that tan(q) =s x. If the size, s, of the object is constant, then the changes with time imply that tan(q(t)) =s x(t).

Where did the minus sign go in the nal result ofdq dtfor Example 15.8? sv/(x2+s2). The angle thus changes at a rate proportional to the speed of the object. \u0006 The dependence on the size of the object is more involved. This is ex- plored next. The Zebra danio and a looming predator Visual angles are important to predator avoidance. We use the ideas of Example 15.8 to consider a problem in biology, studied by Larry Dill, a biologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, BC. The Zebra danio is a small tropical sh, with many predators. In order to survive, it must sense danger quickly enough to be able to escape from a pair of hungry jaws. At the same time, over-reacting to every perceived motion could be counter-productive, wasting energy and time better spent on foraging. Here, we investigate the visual basis of an escape response, based on a hypothesis by Dill [Dill, 1974a,b]. Figure 15.5 shows the relation between the angle subtended at the danio's eye and the prole size Sof an approaching predator, currently located at distance xaway. Suppose that the predator approaches at constant speed, vso that the distance xis decreasing. Then dx dt=\u0000v. Using this information and geometry, we characterize the rate of change of the angle a.334 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE CES preyS predator x Sx Figure 15.4: A cartoon showing the visual angle, a(t)and how it changes as a predator approaches its prey, the Zebra danio.

Solution. If we consider the top half of the triangle shown in Figure 15.5 we nd a Pythagorean triangle identical to that of Example 15.8, but with q=a/2ands=S/2.

Featured Problem 15.2 (Demo of looming predator) Set up an interactive (Desmos) graph that represents an elliptical \"predator\" centered at x=a that approaches its prey along the xaxis. Draw the visual angle that this predator creates at (0,0). Assume that the equation of the predator is given by the ellipse (x\u0000a)2+y2/s2=1. By animating the parameter a, you should be able to make the predator move. (Refer to Featured Problem 9.3 for the geometry.) Example 15.10 (Distance-dependence) Use the relationship in Eqn. (15.4) to sketch a rough graph of the rate of change of the visual angle aversus the distance x of the predator.CYC LES ,PERI ODS ,AN D RATES OF CHAN GE 335 Solution. We are asked to sketch da/dtversus x. Let us denote by f(x)the function of xthat we want to graph. Then from Eqn. (15.4), f(x)\u0011Sv x2+ (S2/4). We rst make three observations about this function. Reference sketching skills developed throughout course? Particular chapters? When x=0, (and the predator has reached its prey), f(0) =Sv 0+ (S2/4)=4v S. This provides the \"y-intercept\" of the graph. Since xappears in the denominator, the function f(x)is always decreas- ing. Forx!\u00a5(the predator is very far away), the denominator is very large, so f(x)!0. The sketch of f(x)(the rate of change of the visual angle, da/dt) versus distance xof the predator is shown in Figure 15.6. 4v Sf(x) x Figure 15.6: The function f(x)plotted against x. This graph shows that the rate of change of visual angle da/dt\u0011f(x)is small when the distance to the predator xis large.\u0006 When to escape? What sort of visual input should the danio respond to, if it is to be efcient at avoiding the predator? In principle, we would like to consider a response that has the following features: If the predator is too far away, or moving slowly, (or moving further away), it is likely harmless and should not trigger an escape response. If the predator is moving quickly towards the danio, it is likely a threat, and should trigger the escape response. Accordingly, the hypothesis proposed by Dill is that: The escape response is triggered when the predator approaches so quickly, that the rate of change of the visual angle is greater than some critical value. Then the critical value, denoted Kcrit>0, is a constant that depends on the \"skittishness of the prey or level of perceived danger of its environment. Hence, the danio's escape response is triggered when da dt=Kcrit. \u0006 Example 15.11 (Finding the predator's distance) How far away is the predator when the escape response is triggered?336 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Solution.

The value x=xreactis the distance of the predator at the instant that the escape response is triggered, termed the reaction distance . Solving for x, (Exercise Interpret the reaction distance xreact. Are there ever cases in which the prey does not notice a predator in time to escape? Solution. Figure 15.7(b) illustrates a case where Kcrit=Sv/(x2+ (S2/4)) is never satised. This could happen if either the danio has a very high threshold of alert (large Kcrit), or if 4v/Sis too low. That happens either if S is very large (big predator) or if vis small (predator slowly \"stalks\" its prey). From this scenario, we nd that in some situations, the fate of the danio would be sealed in the jaws of its pursuer. \u0006 Large slow predators beat danio's escape response. Notice the reaction distance, xreact, of the danio with reaction threshold Kcritis largest for certain sizes of predators. In Figure 15.8, we plot the reaction distance xreactversus the predator size S. We see that for very small predators ( S\u00190) or large predators ( S\u00194v/Kcrit) the distance at which escape response is triggered is very small. This means that the danio may miss noticing such predators until they are too close for a comfortable escape, resulting in calamity.CYC LES ,PERI ODS ,AN D RATES OF CHAN GE 337 On the other hand, some predators are detected when they are very far away- they have a large xreact.

Which panel of Figure 15.8 would you use to determine the distance at which a danio would react to a predator of xed size? 20. According to Figure 15.8 what size predator is easiest to detect farthest away? what size is undetectable until it is too close? 21. According to Figure 15.8 what is the slowest moving predator that is just barely detected? How far away is a predator detected if its speed is 10 distance units per unit time?Example 15.13 (Bad design for a predator) Some predators are more easily detected than others. Find the size of predator for which the reaction distance is maximal, and interpret your nding. Solution. We solve this problem using differentiation (Exercise 12) and nd that xreacthas a critical point at S=2v/Kcrit. From Figure 15.8(a), we see that this critical point is a local maximum. We can also reason based on Eqn. (15.6) :xreactcannot be negative. However, we see that xreact=0atS=0 and at S=4v/Kcrit. Hence, xreacthas a local maximum for some predator size between these two values. In short, a predator of size S=2v/Kcritwould be detected as far away as possible (largest possible xreact), giving the prey a good chance to escape. \u0006 Observe that at sizes S>4v/Kcrit, the reaction distance is not dened. We also see this Figure 15.7(b): when Kcrit>4v/S, the straight line and the curve fail to intersect, and there is no solution. Figure 15.8(b) illustrates the dependence of the reaction distance xreacton the speed vof the predator. We nd that for small values of v,xreactis not dened: the danio would not notice the threat posed by predators that swim very slowly. See Exercise 13 for the largest velocity that fails to trigger the escape response. Alternate approach involving inverse trig functions Note: this section is optional and can be skipped or left for independent study. In Section 15.3, we studied the escape response of the Zebra danio and showed that the connection between the visual angle and distance to predator338 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS tan\u0010a 2\u0011 =(S/2) x. (15.7) We also computed the rate of change of the visual angle per unit time using implicit differentiation and related rates. Here we illustrate an alternate approach using inverse trigonometric functions. (This provides practice with differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions.) Example 15.14 Use the inverse function arctan to restate the angle ain Eqn. 15.7 as a function of x. Then differentiate that function using the chain rule to compute d a/dt. Solution. Restate the relationship using the function arctan: a 2=arctan\u0012S 2x\u0013 . Both the angle aand the distance xchange we indicate this by writing a(t) =2arctan\u0012S 2x(t)\u0013 . Applying the chain rule, let u=S/2x. Recall that Sis a constant, so a(u) = 2arctan (u). Using the derivative of the inverse trigonometric function, darctan (u) du=1 u2+1 and the result, da dt=Sv x2+ (S2/4).

What does this imply about the constants Sandf? Mary starts studying in school at time t=0 with no knowledge at all. How much knowledge does she have after 4 years (i.e. at t=4)? (b)Tom learned so much in preschool that his knowledge when en- tering school at time t=0isy=100. However, once Tom is in school, he stops studying completely. What does this imply about the constants Sandf? How long does it take him to forget 75% of what he knew? (c)Jane studies at the rate of 10units per year and forgets at rate of0.2per year.

Slope of a straight line . We dene the slope of a straight line as follows: Slope =Dy Dx where Dymeans \"change in the yvalue\" and Dxmeans \"change in the x value\" between two points. See Figure A.1 for what this notation represents. xy xy Figure A.1: The slope of a line (usually given the symbol m) is the ratio of the change in the yvalue, Dyto the change in thexvalue, Dx.Equation of a straight line. Using this basic geometric property, we can nd the equation of a straight line given any of the following information about the line: The y-intercept, b, and the slope, m: y=mx+b. A point (x0,y0)on the line, and the slope, m, of the line: y\u0000y0 x\u0000x0=m Two points on the line, say (x1,y1)and(x2,y2): y\u0000y1 x\u0000x1=y2\u0000y1 x2\u0000x1 Note: any of these can be rearranged or simplied to produce the standard form y=mx+b, as discussed in the problem set. The following examples serve as a refresher on nding the equation of the line that satises each of the given conditions.364 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Example A.1 In each case write the equation of the straight line that satis- es the given statements. Note: you should also be able to easily sketch the line in each case. (a) The line has slope 2and y-intercept 4. (b) The line goes through the points (1,1)and(3,\u00002). (c) The line has y-intercept -1 and x-intercept 3. (d) The line has slope \u00001and goes through the point (\u00002,\u00005). Solution. (a)We can use the standard form of the equation of a straight line, y=mx+b where mis the slope and bis the y-intercept to obtain the equation: y= 2x+4. (b)The line goes through the points (1,1)and(3,\u00002). We use the fact that the slope is the same all along the line. Thus, (y\u0000y0) (x\u0000x0)=(y1\u0000y0) (x1\u0000x0)=m. Substituting in 3,\u00002), (y\u00001) (x\u00001)=(1+2) nd y-intercept\u00001andx-intercept 3, i.e. goes through the points (0,\u00001)and(3,0). We can use the method in (b) to get y=1 3x\u00001 Alternately, as a shortcut, we could nd the slope, m=Dy Dx=1 3. Note:Dmeans m=1/3 and b=\u00001 (y-intercept), leading to the same result.

Similarly, we can derive many properties of manipulations of exponents. A list of these appears below, and holds for any positive base a. 1. 2a2b=2a+bas with all similar exponent manipulations. 2.(2a)b=2abalso stems from simple rules for manipulating exponents. 3. 2xis a function that is dened, continuous, and differentiable for all real values x. 4. 2x>0 for all values of x. 5.

B.2 Manipulating logarithms The following properties hold for logarithms of anybase (we used base 2 in our previous section and keep the same base here). Properties of the logarithm stem directly from properties of the exponential function, and include the following: 1. =\u0000log2(a).C A Review of Simple Functions We review a few basic concepts related to functions. C.1 What is a function? A function is just a way of expressing a special relationship between a value we consider as the input (\" x\") value and an associated output (\" y\") value. We write this relationship in the form y=f(x) to indicate that ydepends on x. The only constraint on this relationship is that, for every value of xwe can get at most one value of y. This is equivalent to the\"vertical line property\" : the graph of a function can intersect a vertical line at most at one point. The set of all allowable xvalues is called the domain of the function, and the set of all resulting values of yare the range . Naturally, we do not always use the symbols xandyto represent indepen- dent and dependent variables. For example, the relationship V=4 3pr3 expresses a functional connection between the radius, r, and the volume, V, of a sphere. We say in such a case that \" Vis a function of r\". xy Figure C.1: The above elliptical curve cannot be the graph of a function. The dashed vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point: this means that a given value of xcorresponds to \"too many\" values ofy. If we restrict ourselves to the top part of the ellipse only (or the bottom part only), then we can create a function which has the corresponding graph.All the sketches shown in Figure C.2 are valid functions. The rst is merely a collection of points, xvalues and associated yvalues. The second a histogram. The third sketch is meant to represent the collection of smooth continuous functions - those of most interest to usnin the study of calculus. On the other hand, the example shown in Figure C.1 is not the graph of a function. We see that a vertical line intersects this curve at more than one point. This is not permitted since a given value of xmay have at most one corresponding value of y.368 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES y x xy y x Figure C.2: All the examples above repre- sent functions. C.2 Geometric transformations It is helpful to recognize what happens to the graph of a function when the relationship between the variables is changed slightly. Often this is called applying a transformation . In Figure C.3 we illustrate (a) an original function f(x), (b) the function f(x\u0000a)which shifts fto the right along the positive x-axis by a distance a, and (c) the function f(x) +bshifting fup they-axis (c)y=f(x) +b Figure C.3: Shifting the graph of a function horizontally and vertically Figure C.4 illustrates what happens to a function when shifts, scaling, or reflections occur: a function y=f(x)is shown with a black solid line. On the same graph are superimposed the reflections of this graph about the x axis, y=\u0000f(x)(dashed black), about the y axis y=f(\u0000x)(red), and about theyand the x-axis, y=\u0000f(\u0000x)(red dashed). The latter is equivalent to a rotation of the original graph about the origin. y=f(x) y=f(x)y=f(x) y=f(x)xy Figure C.4: A function and its reflections about xandy-axes.A R EVIEW OF SI M PLE FUNC TIONS 369 C.3 Classifying While life offers amazing complexity, one way to study living things is to classify them into related groups. A biologist looking at animals might group them according to certain functional properties - being warm blooded, being mammals, having fur or claws, or having some other interesting characteristic. In the same way, mathematicians often classify the objects they study (e.g. functions) into related groups. An example of way to group functions into very broad classes is also shown in Figure C.5. constant linear power smooth wild unpredictablehas a derivativeeasily computedconstant slope Figure C.5: Classifying functions according to their properties. From left to right, the complexity of behaviour in this chart grows: at left, we see constant and linear functions; these are \"most convenient\" or simplest to describe: one or two parameters sufce (e.g. intercept or slope). Further to the right are smooth and continuous functions, while rightmost some more irregular, discontinuous function represents those that are outside the group of the \"well-behaved\". In Section C.4 we study examples along this spectrum. Towards this end, we describe properties they share, properties they inherit form their \"cousins,\" and new characteristics that appear at distinct branches. C.4 Power functions and symmetry In this section we list some features of each family of power functions. Even integer powers.

What are the coordinates of the three intersection points of even power functions?1.The graphs of all the even power functions intersect at x=0and at atx=\u00061.

We equivalently say that these functions are \"un- bounded from above.\" 4.The graphs are all symmetric about the y-axis. This special type of symme- try is of interest in other types of functions (not just power functions). A function with this property is called an even function . Odd integer powers . For n=1,3,5,7, :::and other odd powers, the graphs have shapes shown in Figure 1.4(b) and the following characteristics: Mastered Material Check 2. What are the coordinates of the three intersection points of odd power functions?1. The graphs of the odd power functions intersect at x=0 and at x=\u00061. 2. None of the odd power functions have a minimum value. 3.Asx!+\u00a5,y!+\u00a5. As x!\u0000\u00a5,y!\u0000\u00a5. The functions are \"unbounded from above and below.\" 4.The graphs are all symmetric about the origin. This special type of symme- try is of interest in other types of functions (not just power functions). A function with this type of symmetry is called an odd function . Further properties of intersections Consider the even and odd functions graphed in Figure C.6. Notice that a horizontal line intersects the graph only once for the odd power but possibly twice for the even power. Note: we must allow for the case when the line does not intersect at all, or that it intersects precisely at the minimum point. These observations holds in the case of general even and odd power functions as well. 1.510.5 0.5 1 1.50.511.52 (b) Figure C.6: The even power functions intersect a horizontal line in up to two places, while the odd power functions intersect such a line in only one place.A R EVIEW OF SI M PLE FUNC TIONS 371 A horizontal line has an equation of the form y=Cwhere Cis some constant. To nd where it intersects the graph of a power function y=xn, we solve an equation of the form xn=C. (C.1) To do so, take nthroot of both sides: (xn)1/n=C1/n. Simplifying, using algebraic operations on powers leads to (xn)1/n=xn/n=x1=x=C1/n. However, we must allow that there may be more than one solution to Eqn. (C.1) , as shown for some C>0in Figure C.6. This demonstrates a distinction between odd and even power functions. If nis even then the solutions to Eqn. (C.1) are x=\u0006C1/n, whereas if nis odd, there is a single solution, x=C1/n. In general, we can dene even and odd functions . Denition C.1 (Even and odd functions) A function that is symmetric about the y-axis is said to be an even function. A function that is symmetric about the origin is said to be an oddfunction. Even functions satisfy the relationship f(x) =f(\u0000x). Odd functions satisfy the relationship f(x) =\u0000f(\u0000x). Examples of even functions include y=cos(x),y=\u0000x8,y=jxjwhich are all their own mirror images when reflected about the y-axis. Examples of odd functions are y=sin(x),y=\u0000x3,y=x. Each of these functions is its own double-reflection (about yand then x-axes). In a later calculus course, when we compute integrals, taking these sym- metries into account can help to simplify (or even avoid) calculations. Optional: Combining even and odd functions Not every function is either odd or even. However, if we start with symmetric functions, some manipulations can either preserve or reverse the symmetry. Example C.1 Show that the product of an even and an odd function is an odd function.372 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI CES Solution. Letf(x)be even. Then f(x) =f(\u0000x). function. Then g(x) =\u0000g(\u0000x). We dene h(x)to be the product of these two functions, h(x) =f(x)g(x). Using the properties of get h(x) =f(x)g(x) but this is just the same as \u0000h(\u0000x). We have established that h(x) =\u0000h(\u0000x), so the new function is odd. \u0006 A function is not always even or odd. Many functions are neither even nor odd. However, it ispossible to show that given any function, y=f(x), we can write it as a sum of an even and an odd function. This is left as a challenge for the reader, with the following hint: Hint: suppose f(x)is not an even nor an odd function. Consider dening the two =1 2(f(x)\u0000f(\u0000x)). Can you draw a sketch of what these would look like for the function given in Figure C.3(a)? Show that fe(x)is even and that f0(x)is odd. Now show that f(x) =fe(x) +f0(x). C.5 Inverse functions and fractional powers Suppose we are given a function expressed in the form y=f(x). This implies that xis the independent variable, and yis obtained from it by evaluating a function, i.e. by using the \"rule\" or operation specied by that function. This mathematical statement expresses a certain relationshipA R EVIEW OF SI M PLE FUNC TIONS 373 between the two variables, xandy, in which the roles are distinct: xis a value we pick, and yis calculated from it. However, sometimes we can express a relationship in more than one way: as an example, if the connection between xandyis simple squaring, then provided x>0, we might write either y=x2or x=y1/2=py to express the same relationship. In other words y=x2,x=py. We have used two distinct functions to describe the relationship from two points of view: one function involves squaring and the other takes a square root. We may also notice that for x>0, f(g(x)) = (px)2=x, g(f(x)) =q functions invert each other's effect. Functions that satisfy y=f(x),x=g(y) are said to be inverse functions . We often use the notation f\u00001(x)to denote the function that acts as an inverse function to f(x). Graphical property of inverse functions The graph of an inverse function y=f\u00001(x)is geometrically related to the graph of the original function: it is a reflection of y=f(x)about the 45\u000e line, y=x. This relationship is shown in Figure C.7(a) for a pair of functions f andf\u00001. But why should this be true? The idea is as follows: suppose that (a,b)is any point on the graph of y=f(x). This means that b=f(a). That, in turn, implies that a=f\u00001(b), which then tells us that (b,a)must be a point on the graph of f\u00001(x). But the points (a,b)and(b,a)are related by reflection about the line y=x. This is true for any arbitrary point, and so must be true for allpoints on the graphs of the two functions. Restricting the domain The above argument establishes that, given the graph of a function, its inverse is obtained by reflecting the graph in an imaginary mirror placed along a liney=x. However, a difculty could arise. In particular, for the function y=f(x) =x2,374 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE CES a)y=f(x) y=f1(x) xy (a, b)(b, y=f(x)y=f1(x) xy (b) C.7: The point (a,b)is on the graph ofy=f(x). If the roles of xandyare interchanged, this point becomes (b,a). Geometrically, this point is the reflection of(a,b)about the line y=x. Thus, the graph of the inverse function y=f\u00001(x)is related to the graph of the original function by reflection about the line y=x. In (b), the inverse is not a function, as it does not satisfy the vertical line property. In (a), both fand its reflection satisfy that property, and thus the inverse, f\u00001is a true function. a reflection of this type would lead to a curve that cannot be a function, as shown in Figure C.8. Note: the sideways parabola would not be a function if we included both its branches, since a given value of xwould have two associated yvalues. To x such problems, we simply restrict the domain to x>0, i.e. to the solid parts of the curves shown in Figure C.8. For this subset of the x-axis, we have no problem dening the inverse function. 1.510.5 0.5 1 1.5 11y=x1/2 y=x2 omit this branch blue curve is not a function if this branch is includedxy Figure C.8: The graph of y=f(x) =x2 (black) and of its inverse function (red). We cannot dene the inverse for all x, because the red parabola does not satisfy the vertical line property. However, if we restrict the original function to positive xvalues, this problem is circumvented. Observe that the problem described above would be encountered for any of the even power functions by virtue of their symmetry about the y-axis but not by the odd power functions. For example, y=f(x) =x3, y=f\u00001(x) =x1/3 are inverse functions for all xvalues: when we reflect the graph of x3about the line y=xwe do not encounter the problem of multiple yvalues.A R EVIEW OF SI M PLE FUNC TIONS 375 This follows directly from the horizontal line properties that we saw in Figure C.6. When we reflect the graphs shown in Figure C.6 about the liney=x, the horizontal lines are reflected onto vertical lines. Odd power functions have inverses that intersect a vertical line exactly once, i.e. they satisfy the \"vertical line property\" discussed earlier. C.6 Polynomials Recall that a polynomial is a function of the form y=p(x) =anxn+an\u00001xn\u00001+\u0001\u0001\u0001+a1x+a0. This form is sometimes referred to as superposition (i.e. simple addition) of the basic power functions with integer powers. The constants akare called coefcients. In practice, some of these may be zero. We restrict attention to the case where all these coefcients are real numbers. The highest power n (whose coefcient is not zero) is called the degree of the polynomial. We are interested in these functions for several reasons. Primarily, we nd that computations involving polynomials are particularly easy, since operations include only the basic addition and multiplication. Features of polynomials Zeros of a polynomial: values of xsuch that y=p(x) =0. Ifp(x)is quadratic (a polynomial of degree 2) then the quadratic formula gives a simple way of nding roots of this equation/zeros of the polyno- mial. Generally, for most polynomials of degree higher than 5, there is no analytical recipe for nding zeros. Geometrically, zeros are places where the graph of the function y=p(x)crosses the x-axis. This fact is ex- ploited in Chapter 5 to approximate the values of the zeros using Newton's Method . Critical Points: places on the graph where the value of the function is locally larger than those nearby (local maxima) or smaller than those nearby (local minima) are of interest to us. Calculus is one of the main tools for detecting and identifying such places. Behaviour for very large x:all polynomials are unbounded as x!\u00a5and asx!\u0000\u00a5. For large enough values of x, the power function y=f(x) =xn with the largest power, n, dominates over other power functions with smaller powers, as seen in Chapter 1. For p(x) =anxn+an\u00001xn\u00001+\u0001\u0001\u0001+a1x+a0,376 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES the rst (highest power) term dominates for large x. Thus for large x (whether positive or negative), p(x)\u0019anxnfor large x. Behaviour for small x:close to the origin, power functions with smallest powers dominate (see Chapter 1). Thus, for x\u00190the polynomial is governed by the behaviour of the smallest (non-zero coefcient) power, i.e., p(x)\u0019a1x+a0for small x.D Limits We introduced notation involving limits without carefully dening what was meant. Here, such technical matters are briefly discussed. The concept of a limit helps us to describe the behaviour of a function close to some point of interest. This is useful in the case of functions that are either not continuous , ornot dened somewhere. We use the notation lim x!af(x) to denote the value the function fapproaches as xgets closer and closer to the value a. D.1 Limits for continuous functions Ifx=ais a point at which the function is dened and continuous (informally: has no \"breaks in its graph\") the value of the limit and the value of the function at a point are the same, i.e. Iffis continuous at x=athen lim x!af(x) =f(a). Example D.1 Find lim x!0f(x)for the function y =f(x) =10. Solution. This function is continuous (and constant) everywhere. In fact, the value of the function is independent of x. We conclude immediately that lim x!0f(x) =lim x!010=10. \u0006 Example D.2 Find lim x!0f(x)for the function y =f(x) =sin(x). Solution. This function is a continuous trigonometric function, and has the value sin (0) =0 at the origin. Thus lim x!0f(x) =lim x!0sin(x) =0.378 FFERENTI LI FE SCIEN CES \u0006 Power functions are continuous everywhere. This motivates the next example. Example D.3 Compute the limit lim x!0xnwhere n is a positive integer. Solution. The function in question, f(x) =xn, is a simple power function that is continuous everywhere. Further, f(0) =0for any na positive integer. Hence the limit as x!0coincides with the value of the function at that point, so lim x!0xn=0. \u0006 D.2 Properties of limits Suppose we are given two functions, f(x)andg(x). we also assume that both functions have (nite) limits at the point x=a. Then the following statements follow. 1. lim \u0001\u0010 lim x!ag(x)\u0011 4. Provided that lim x!ag(x)6=0, we also have that lim x!a\u0012f(x) g(x)\u0013 = lim x!af(x) lim x!ag(x)! . The rst two statements are equivalent to linearity of the process of computing a limit. Example D.4 Find lim x!2f(x)for the function y =f(x) =2x2\u0000x3. Solution. Since this function is a polynomial, and so continuous everywhere, we can simply plug in the relevant value of x, i.e. lim x!2\u0000 2x2\u0000x3\u0001=2\u000122\u000023=0. Thus when xgets closer to 2, the value of the function gets closer to 0. \u0006 Note: when the function is continuous, the value of the limit is the same as the value of the function at the given point.LIM I TS 379 D.3 Limits of rational functions Case 1: Denominator nonzero We rst consider functions that are the quotient of two polynomials, y= f(x)/g(x)at points were g(x)6=0. This allows us to apply Property 4 of limits together with what we have learned about the properties of power func- tions and polynomials. Much of this discussion is related to the properties of power functions and dominance of lower (higher) powers at small (large) values of x, as discussed in Chapter 1. In the examples below, we consider both limits at the origin (at x=0) and at innity (for x!\u00a5). The latter means \"very large x\". See Section 1.4for examples of the informal version of the same reasoning used to reach the same conclusions. Example D.5 Find the limit as x!0and as x!\u00a5of the quotients (a)Kx kn+x,(b)Axn an+xn. Solution. We recognize (a) as an example of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, found in (1.8) and (b) as a Hill function in (1.7) of Chapter 1. We now compute, rst for x!0, (a) lim x!0Kx kn+x=0, (b) lim x!0Axn an+xn=0. This follows from the fact that, provided a,kn6=0, both functions are continu- ous at x=0, so that their limits are the same as the actual values attained by the functions. Now for x!\u00a5 (a) lim x!\u00a5Axn the fact that the constants kn,anare always \"swapped out\" by the value of xasx!\u00a5, allowing us to obtain the result. Other than the formal limit notation, there is nothing new here that we have not already discussed in Sections 1.5. \u0006 Below we apply similar reasoning to other examples of rational functions. Example D.6 Find the limit as x!0and as x!\u00a5of the quotients (a)3x2 9+x2,(b)1+x 1+x3. Solution. For part (a) we note that as x!\u00a5, the quotient approaches 3x2/x2= 3. As x!0, both numerator and denominator are dened and the denominator is nonzero, so we can use the 4th property of limits. We thus nd that (a) lim x!\u00a53x2 9+x2=3, lim x!03x2 9+x2=0,380 AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES For part (b), we use the fact that as x!\u00a5, the limit approaches x/x3=x\u00002! 0. As x!0we can apply property 4 yet again to compute the (nite) limit, so that (b) lim x!\u00a51+x 1+x3=0, lim x!01+x 1+x3=1. \u0006 Example D.7 Find the following function at 0and\u00a5 y=x4\u00003x2+x\u00001 x5+x. Solution. Forx!\u00a5powers with the largest power dominate, whereas forx!0, smaller powers dominate. Hence, we the latter case, the limit does not exist. \u0006 Case 2: zero in the denominator and \"holes\" in a graph In the previous examples, evaluating the limit, where it existed, was as simple as plugging the appropriate value of xinto the function itself. The next example shows that this is not always possible. Example D.8 Compute the limit as x !4of the function f (x) =1/(x\u00004) Solution. This function has a vertical asymptote at x=4. Indeed, the value of the function shoots off to +\u00a5if we approach x=4from above, and\u0000\u00a5if we approach the same point from below. We say that the limit does not exist in this case. \u0006 Example D.9 Compute the limit as x!\u0000 1of the Solution. We compute lim x!\u00001x x2\u00001=lim x!\u00001x (x\u00001)(x+1) It is evident (even before factoring as we have done) that this function has a vertical asymptote at x=\u00001where the denominator approaches zero. Hence, the limit does not exist. \u0006 Next, we describe an extremely important example where the function has a \"hole\" in its graph, but where a nite limit exists. This kind of limit plays a huge role in the denition of a derivative. Example D.10 Find lim x!2f(x)for the function y = (x\u00002)/(x2\u00004).LIM I TS 381 Solution. This function is a quotient of two rational expressions f(x)/g(x) but we note that limx!2g(x) =limx!2(x2\u00004) =0. Thus we cannot use property 4 directly. However, we can simplify the quotient by observing that forx6=2the function y= (x\u00002)/(x2\u00004) = ( x\u00002)/(x\u00002)(x+2)takes on the same values as the expression 1/(x+2). At the point x=2, the function itself is not dened, since we are not allowed division by zero. However, the limit of this function does exist: lim x!2f(x) =lim x!2(x\u00002) (x2\u00004). Provided x6=2 x!2(x\u00002) x!2(x\u00002) (x\u00002)(x+2)=lim x!21 a \"hole\" in its graph at x=2. The limit of the function as xapproaches 2does \"supplies the missing D.11 Compute the limit lim h!0K(x+h)2\u0000Kx2 h. Solution. This is a calculation we would perform to compute the derivative of the function y=Kx2from the denition of the derivative. Details have already been displayed in Example 2.10. The essential idea is that we expand the numerator and simplify algebraically as follows: lim h!0K(2xh+h2) h=lim h!0K(2x+h) =2Kx. Even though the quotient is not dened at the value h=0(as the denominator is zero there), the limit exists, and hence the derivative can be dened. \u0006 See also Example 3.12 for a similar calculation for the function Kx3. D.4 Right and left sided limits Some functions are discontinuous at a point, but we may still be able to dene a limit that the function attains as we approach that point from the right or from the left. (This is equivalent to gradually decreasing or gradually increasing xas we get closer to the point of interest. Consider the function f(x) =( 0 if x<0; 1 if x>0. This is a step function, whose values is 0 for negative real numbers, and 1 for positive real numbers. The function is not even dened at the point x=0and382 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES has a jump in its graph. However, we can still dene a right and a left limit as follows: lim x!+0f(x) =1, lim x!\u00000f(x) =0. That is, the limit as we approach from the right is 0whereas from the left it is 1. We also state the following result: Iff(x)has a right and a left limit at a point x=aand if those limits are equal, then we say that the limit at x=aexists, and we write lim x!+af(x) = lim x!\u0000af(x) =lim x!af(x) Example D.12 Find lim =f(x) =tan(x). Solution. function tan(x) =sin(x)/cos(x)cannot be continuous at x= p/2because cos(x)in the denominator takes on the value of zero at the point x=p/2. Moreover, the value of this function becomes unbounded (grows without a limit) as x!p/2. We say in this case that \"the limit does not exist\". We sometimes use the notation lim x!p/2tan(x) =\u0006\u00a5. (We can distinguish the fact that the function approaches +\u00a5asxap- proaches p/2 from below, and\u0000\u00a5asxapproaches p/2 from higher values.) \u0006 D.5 Limits at innity We can also describe the behaviour \"at innity\" i.e. the trend displayed by a function for very large (positive or negative) values of x. We consider a few examples of this sort below. Example D.13 Find lim x!\u00a5f(x)for the function y =f(x) =x3\u0000x5+x. Solution. All polynomials grow in an unbounded way as xtends to very large values. We can determine whether the function approaches positive or negative unbounded values by looking at the coefcient of the highest power ofx, since that power dominates at large xvalues. In this example, we nd that the term\u0000x5is that highest power. Since this has a negative coefcient, the function approaches unbounded negative values as xgets larger in the positive direction, i.e. lim x!\u00a5x3\u0000x5+x=lim x!\u00a5\u0000x5=\u0000\u00a5. \u0006LIM I TS 383 Example limits: (a)lim x!\u00a5e\u00002x,(b) lim x!\u0000\u00a5e5x, Solution. The function y=e\u00002xbecomes arbitrarily small as x!\u00a5. The function y=e5xbecomes arbitrarily small as x!\u0000\u00a5. Thus we have (a) lim x!\u00a5e\u00002x=0, (b) lim x!\u0000\u00a5e5x=0. (a)lim x!\u00a5x2e\u00002x,(b)lim x!01 xe\u0000x, Solution. For part (a) we state here the fact that as x!\u00a5, the exponential function with negative exponent decays to zero faster than any power func- tion increases. For part (b) we note that for the quotient e\u0000x/xwe have that asx!0the top satises e\u0000x!e0=1, while the denominator has x!0. Thus the limit at x!0 cannot exist. We nd that (a) lim x!\u00a5x2e\u00002x=0, (b) lim x!01 xe\u0000x=\u00a5, \u0006 D.6 Summary of special limits As a reference, in the table below, we collect some of the special limits that are useful in a variety of situations. Function xxx!!! Limit notation value e\u0000ax,a>0 A collection of useful limits. We can summarize the information in this table informally as follows:384 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES 1.The exponential function exgrows faster than any power function as x increases, and conversely the function e\u0000x=1/exdecreases faster than any power of (1/x)asxgrows. The same is true for eaxprovided a>0. 2.The logarithm ln(x)is an increasing function that keeps growing without bound as xincreases, but it does not grow as rapidly as the function y=x. The same is true for ln(ax)provided a>0. The logarithm is not dened for negative values of its argument and as xapproaches zero, this function becomes unbounded and negative. However, it approaches \u0000\u00a5more slowly than xapproaches 0. For this reason, the expression xln(x)has a limit of 0 as x!0.E Proofs This Appendix was written by Dr. Sophie Burrill. E.1 Proof of the power rule We present a proof for the power rule. Recall from Section 4.1: Thepower rule states that the derivative of the power function f(x) = xn isnxn\u00001. Proof. We begin f0(x) =lim h!0f(x+h)\u0000f(x) h=lim (x+h)nentails lenthy algebra. We employ k(k\u00001):::2\u00011xn\u0000kyk+:::+nxyn\u00001+yn Note that this means the expansion of (x+y)nis a sum of terms of the form ckxn\u0000kyk, k=0,1,:::,n where ck(called a \"binomial coefcient\") is a coefcient that depends on both nandk. The exact form of ckis not necessary for the proof of the power rule - except for the terms c0=1 and c1=n, the coefcients of xnandxn\u00001y. Let us use the binomial theorem and expand the numerator in the deni-386 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI ( +:::+cn\u00001xhn\u00001+cnhn)\u0000xn We can rewrite using the fact that c0=1 and note that the terms xncancel: (x+h)n\u0000xn= (xn+c1xn\u00001h+:::+cnhn)\u0000xn=c1xn\u00001h+:::+cnhn. All of the remaining terms have has a factor, which we can factor out: (x+h)n\u0000xn=h[c1xn\u00001+c2xn\u00002h+\u0001\u0001\u0001+cnhn\u00001]. Substituting this into the denition of the derivative we achieve: f0(x) = lim h!0f(x+h)\u0000f(x) h=lim h!0(x+h)n\u0000xn h = lim h!0h[c1xn\u00001+c2xn\u00002h+\u0001\u0001\u0001+cnhn\u00001] h = lim h!0[c1xn\u00001+c2xn\u00002h+\u0001\u0001\u0001+cnhn\u00001] Note that all terms except for the rst have has a factor and so tend to 0 ash!0. This gives that f0(x) =c1xn\u00001, and we have already noted that c1=n, so f0(x) =nxn\u00001, which proves the power rule. \u0003 E.2 Proof of the product rule We proof the product rule. Recall from Section 4.1: The product rule: Iff(x)andg(x)are two functions, each differentiable in then d[f(x)g(x)] dx=d f(x) dxg(x) +dg(x) dxf(x). +g0(x)f(x).PROO FS 387 Proof. Letk(x) = f(x)g(x), the product of the two functions. We use the denition of the derivative: k0(x) =lim h!0k(x+h)\u0000k(x) h=lim helpful factoring: k0(x) = lim h!0f(x+h)g(x+h)\u0000f(x)g(x+h) +f(x)g(x+h)\u0000f(x)g(x) h h = lim h!0f(x+h)\u0000f(x) hg(x+h) +f(x)g(x+h)\u0000g(x) h Due to properties of limits (see Appendix D.2) we can distribute the limit and recognize = f0(x)g(x) the power rule, that [f(x)g(x)]0=f0(x)g(x) +f(x)g0(x). \u0003 E.3 Proof of the quotient rule We provide a proof the quotient rule. Recall from Section 4.1: The quotient rule: Iff(x)andg(x)are two functions, each differentiable in the domain of then d dx\u0014f(x) g(x)\u0015 =d f(x) dxg(x)\u0000dg(x) dxf(x) [g(x)]2. We in the form \u0014f(x) g(x)\u00150 =f0(x)g(x)\u0000g0(x)f(x) [g(x)]2. Proof. This proof also follows from the denition of the derivative; it con- tains some careful arithmetic. Let k(x) =f(x) FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Finding a common denominator and then adding 0=g(x+h)f(x+h)\u0000g(x+ h)f(x+h)in the numerator we proceed: properties of limits and identifying the denition of the derivative forg0(x)andf0(x)leads have thus proved the quotient rule. Despite the arithmetic required, hopefully the fact that the denition of the derivative is all that is required provides the reader with some comfort. \u0003 E.4 Proof of the chain rule We present a plausibility argument for the chain rule. Recall from Section 8.1: Ify=g(u)andu=f(x)are both differentiable functions and y=g(f(x))is the composite function, then the chain rule of differentiation states that dy dx=dy dudu dx. Proof. We rst note that if a function is differentiable, it is also continuous. Because of this continuity, when xchanges a very little, ucan change only by a little - there are no abrupt jumps. Thus, using our notation, if Dx!0then Du!0. Now consider the denition of the derivative dy/du: dy du=lim Du!0Dy Du. This means that for any (nite) Du, Dy Du=dy du+e, where e!0 asDu!0. Then Dy=dy duDu+eDu.PROO FS 389 by some (nonzero) Dx: Dy Dx=dy duDu Dx+eDu Dx. Taking Dx!0we get Du!0, (by continuity) and hence also e!0so that as desired, dy dx=dy dudu dx. \u0003F Trigonometry review The denition of trigonometric functions in terms of the angle qin a right triangle are reviewed in Figure.

These aid in simplifying expressions involving the trigonometric functions, as we shall see. Law of cosines. This law relates the cosine of an angle to the lengths of sides formed in a triangle (see Figure F.2). c2=a2+b2\u00002abcos(q) (F.2) where the side of length cis opposite the angle q. ab c Figure F.2: Law of cosines states that c2= a2+b2\u00002abcos(q).There are other important relations between the trigonometric functions (called trigonometric identities ). These should be remembered. Angle sum identities. The trigonometric functions are nonlinear. This means that, for example, the sine of the sum of two angles is notjust the sum of the two sines. One can use the law of cosines and other geometric ideas to establish the sin(A+B) =sin(A)cos(B) +sin(B)cos(A) (F.3) cos(A+B) =cos(A)cos(B)\u0000sin(A)sin(B) (F.4) These two identities appear in many calculations and aid in computing derivatives of basic trigonometric formulae. Related identities . The identities for the sum of angles can be used to derive a number of related formulae. For example, by replacing Bby\u0000Bwe angle formulae: sin(2q) =2sin(q)cos(q) cos(2q) =cos2(q)\u0000sin2(q) and these can 2cos2(q) =1+cos(2q) 2sin2(q) =1\u0000cos(2q).TRI GONO METRY REVI EW 393 F Summary of the inverse trigonometric functions In Table F.2 we show the table of standard values of functions arcsin (x) andarccos (x).

Section G.3 supplements biological examples in Chapters 3 and 4. The material in G.4 supplements examples in Chapter 7 and provides additional practice with optimization. The optimal foraging time for a specic patch function studied in Chapter 7 is generalized in Section G.5. Section G.6 extends the study of trigonometric functions and their derivatives as seen in Chapter 15 to differential equations. G.1 Michaelis-Menten transformed to a linear relationship Michaelis-Menten kinetics explored in Eqn. (1.8) is a nonlinear saturating function in which the concentration xis the independent variable on which the reaction velocity, vdepends: v=Kx kn+x. As discussed in Section 1.5, the constants Kandkndepend on the enzyme and are often quantied in a biochemical assay of enzyme action. Histori- cally, a convenient way to estimate the values of Kandknwas to measure v for many different values of the initial substrate concentration. Without non- linear tting software widely available, Eqn. (1.8) was transformed (meaning that it was rewritten) as a linear relationship. We can do so as well with algebra. We begin by taking reciprocals of our ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES In which case, the relationship between intercept bof the straight line provide information about the parameters. The relationship in Eqn. (G.1) , which is a disguised variant of Michaelian kinetics, is called the Lineweaver-Burk relationship. In Exercise 30 this is used to estimate the values of Kandknfrom biochemical data about an enzyme. G.2 Spacing of sh in a school Many animals live or function best when they are in a group. Social groups include herds of wildebeest, flocks of birds, and schools of sh, as well as swarms of insects. Life in a group can affect the way that individuals forage (search for food), their success at detecting or avoiding being eaten by a predator, and other functions such as mating, protection of the young, etc. Biologists are interested in the ecological implications of groups on their own members or on other species with whom they interact, and how individual behaviour, combined with environmental factors and random effects affect the shape, spacing and function of the groups. In many social groups, the spacing between individuals is relatively constant from one part of the formation to another, because animals that get too close start to move away from one another, whereas those that get too far apart are attracted back. These spacing distances can be observed in a variety of groups, and were described in many biological publications. For example, Emlen [Emlen Jr, 1952] studied flocks of birds and found that gulls are spaced at about one body length apart. Similarly, Conder [J., 1949] observed a 2\u00003body lengths spacing distance in tufted ducks while Miller [R.S. and J.D., 1966] found that in the flock he observed, sandhill cranes try to keep about 5.8 ft apart. To explain why certain spacing is maintained in a group of animals, it was proposed that there are mutual attraction and repulsion interactions (effectively acting like simple forces) between individuals. Breder [Breder, 1954] followed a number of species of sh that school, and measured the individual spacing in units of the sh body length, showing that individuals are separated by 0.16\u00000.25 body length units. He suggested that the effective forces between individuals were similar to inverse power laws for repulsion and attraction. Breder considered a repulsion, xis the distance between individuals, and m,nare integer powers that govern how quickly the interactions fall off with distance. We could re-express the formula inFOR FURTHER STUDY 397 Eqn. (G.2) as c=Ax\u0000m\u0000Rx\u0000n Thus, the function shown in Breder's cohesiveness formula is related to our power functions, but the powers are negative integers. A specic case considered by Breder was m=0,n=2, i.e. constant attraction and inverse square law repulsion, c=A\u0000(R/x2) Breder specically considered the \"point of neutrality\", distance at which this occurs is: x= (R/A)1/2 where attraction and repulsion are balanced. This is the distance at which two sh would be most comfortable: neither tending to move apart, nor get closer together. G.3 A biological speed machine Lysteria monocytogenes is a parasite that lives inside cells of the host, causing a nasty infection. It has been studied by cellular biologists for its amazingly fast propulsion, which uses the host's actin laments as \"rocket fuel\". Actin is part of the structural component of all animal cells, and is known to play a major role in cell motility. Lysteria manages to \"hijack\" this cellular mechanism, assembling it into its own comet tail, which it uses to propel inside the cell and pass from one cell to the next. Figure G.1 illustrates part of these curious traits. Figure G.1: The parasite Lysteria lives inside a host cell. It assembles a \"rocket- like\" tail made up of actin, and uses this assembly to move around the cell, and to pass from one host cell to another. Figure from [Tilney and Portnoy, 1989]. Researchers in cell biology use Lysteria to learn about motility at the cellular level. It has been discovered that certain proteins on the external surface of this parasite (ActA) are responsible for the ability of Lysteria to assemble an actin lament tail. Surprisingly, even small plastic beads articially coated in Lysteria's ActA proteins can perform the same \"trick\": they assemble an actin tail which pushes the bead like a tiny rocket.398 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FOR THE LI FE SCIEN CES Figure G.2: Small spherical beads coated with part of Lysteria's special actin- assembly kit also gain the ability to swim around. Figure from [Bernheim-Groswasser et al., 2002]. In a recent papr, Bernheim-Groswasser et al. [Bernheim-Groswasser et al., 2002] describe the motion of these beads, shown in Figure G.2. When the position of the bead is plotted on a graph with time as the horizontal axis, (see Figure G.3) we nd that the trajectory is not a simple one: it appears that the bead slows down periodically, and then accelerates. Figure G.3: The distance traveled by a little bead is shown as a function of time. The arrows point to times when the particle slowed down or stopped. We can use this data to analyze the velocity of the particles. Figure from [Bernheim-Groswasser et al., 2002]. With the techniques developed in Chapters 3 and 4, we can analyze the experimental data shown in Figure G.3 to determine both the average velocity of the beads, and the instantaneous velocity over the course of the motion. Average velocity of the bead. We can get a rough idea of how fast the micro- beads are moving by computing an average velocity over the time interval shown on the graph. We can use two (approximate) data points (t,D(t)), at the beginning and end of the run, for example (45,20 )and(80,35 ): the average velocity is \u00afv=DD Dt \u00afv=35\u000020 80\u000045\u00190.43mmin\u00001 so the beads move with average velocity 0.43 microns per minute. Units. One micron is 10\u00006meters.The changing instantaneous velocity. Because the actual data points are taken at nite time increments, the curve shown in Figure G.3 is not smooth. We smoothen it, as shown in Figure G.4 for a simpler treatment. In Fig- ure G.5 we sketch this curve together with a collection of lines that represent the slopes of tangents along the curve. A horizontal tangent has slope zero:FOR FURTHER STUDY 399 this means that at all such points (also indicated by the arrows for emphasis), the velocity of the beads is zero. Between these spots, the bead has picked up speed and moved forward until the next time in which it stops. We show the velocity v(t), which is the derivative of the original func- tionD(t)in Figure G.6. As shown here, the velocity has periodic increases and decreases. Figure G.4: The (slightly smoothened) bead trajectory is shown here. Figure G.5: We inserted a sketch of the tangent line congurations along the trajectory from beginning to end. We observe that some of these tangent lines are horizontal, implying a zero derivative, and, thus, a zero instantaneous velocity at that time. Figure G.6: Here we sketched the velocity on the same graph. G.4 Additional examples of geometric optimization Rectangular box with largest surface area We consider two examples of optimization where volumes, lengths, and/or surface areas are considered.400 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Example G.1 (Wrapping a rectangular box) A box with square base and arbitrary height has string tied around each of its perimeter. The total length of string so used is 10inches. Find the dimensions of the box with largest surface area, i.e. determine the largest amount of wrapping paper needed to wrap this box. xy x Figure G.7: A rectangular box is to be wrapped with paper.Solution. The total length of string is shown in Figure G.7. It consists of three perimeters of the box is as follows: L=2(x+x) +2(x+y) +2(x+y) =8x+4y=10. This total length is to be kept constant, so this equation is the constraint in this problem. This means that xandyare related to one another. We use this fact to eliminate one of them from the formula for surface area. The surface area of the box is S=4(xy) +2x2 since there are two faces (top and bottom) which are squares (area x2) and four rectangular faces with area xy. At the moment, the total surface area S is expressed in terms of both variables. Suppose we eliminate yfrom Sby rewriting the constraint in the form: y=5 2\u00002x. Then S(x) =4x\u00125 2\u00002x\u0013 +2x2=10x\u00008x2+2x2=10x\u00006x2. We show the shape of this function in Figure G.8. Note that S(x) =0atx=0 and at 10\u00006x=0 (which occurs at x=5/3). 0 5/6 5/3xS(x) Figure G.8: Figure for Example G.1; surface area of a box.Since Sis now expressed as a function of one variable, we can nd its critical points by setting S0(x) =0, i.e., solving S0(x) =10\u000012x=0 forx: we get x=10/12=5/6. To nd the corresponding value of ywe substitute our result back into the constraint. This results in y=5 2\u00002\u00125 6\u0013 =15\u000010 6=5 6. Thus the dimensions of the box of interest are all the same, i.e. it is a cube with side length 5 /6. We can verify that S00(x) =\u000012<0, (indeed this holds for all x), which means that x=5/6 is a local maximum.FOR FURTHER STUDY 401 Further, nd that S=4\u00125 6\u0013\u00125 6\u0013 +2\u00125 6\u00132 =25 6 square inches, the maximum surface area of a box with such a constraint. Figure G.8 shows how the surface area varies as the dimension xof the box is varied. A cylinder in a sphere Example G.2 (Fitting a cylinder inside a sphere) Find the cylinder of maximal volume that would t inside a sphere of radius R. Solution. We sketch a cylinder inside a sphere as in Figure G.9. rR h/2 rh/2R Figure G.9: Denition of variables and geometry to consider. It is helpful to add the radius of the sphere and of the cylinder. We dene the following: h=height of cylinder, r=radius of cylinder, R=radius of sphere. Then Ris assumed a given xed positive constant, and randhare dimensions of the cylinder to be determined. From Figure G.9 we see that the cylinder ts if the top and bottom rims touch the circle. When this occurs, the dark line in Figure G.9 is a radius of the sphere, and so has length R. The connection between the variables (our constraint) is given from Pythagoras' theorem by: R2=r2+\u0012h 2\u00132 . We maximize cylinder, V=pr2h402 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES subject to the above constraint. Eliminating r2using the Pythagoras theorem leads to V(h) =p\u0012 R2\u0000h2 4\u0013 h. We see that the problem is very similar to the previous discussion. The reader can show by working out the steps that V0(h) =0 occurs at the critical point h=2p 3R and this is a local maximum. G.5 Optimal foraging with other patch functions In Section 7.4, we computed an optimal foraging time for a specic patch function f(t)given by Eqn. (7.6) . However, we can gain insight and obtain an interesting result without making this assumption. We now consider a similar analysis with a more general example. Example G.3 Carry out the calculations for the optimal value patch res- idence time for a general patch energy function f(t), without using the formula Eqn. (7.6) . Solution. We use the expression for R(t)given by Eqn. (7.7) . Differentiating, we = ( t+t)2. calculation is easier with this notation.) To maximize R(t)we set R0(t) =0 which can occur only when the numerator of the above equation is zero, i.e. G(t) =0. This means that f0(t)(t+t)\u0000f(t) algebraically, f0(t) =f(t) t+t. (G.3)FOR FURTHER STUDY 403 A geometric argument. In practice, we need to specify a function for f(t)in order to solve for the optimal time t. However, we can also solve this problem using a geometric argument . Eqn (G.3) equates two quantities that can be interpreted as slopes. On the right is the slope of a tangent line. On the left is the slope (rise over run) of some right triangle whose height is f(t)and whose base length is t+t. In Figure G.10, we show each slope on its own: in the left panel, f0(t)is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(t). In the central panel, we have constructed some triangle with the property that its hypotenuse has slope f(t)/[t+t].On the right panel we have superimposed both, selecting a value of tfor which the slope of the triangle is the same as the slope of the tangent line. f/prime(t)f(t) tenergy gain f(t) +tf(t) t 0energy gain Figure G.10: The solution to the optimal foraging problem can be expressed geomet- rically in the form shown in this gure. The tangent line at the (optimal) time tshould have the same slope as the hypotenuse of the right triangle shown above. The diagram on the far right is sometimes termed the \"rooted tangent\" diagram.Notice that in order to t the triangle on the same diagram, we had to place its tip at the point\u0000talong the horizontal axis. When these slopes coincide, it means that we have satised Eqn. (G.3) , and found the desired time tfor optimal foraging. We can use this observation to come up with the following steps to solve an optimal foraging problem in general: 1.A biologist conducts some eld experiments to determine the mean travel time from food to nest, t, and the shape of the energy gain function f(t). Note: this may require capturing the animal and examining the contents of its stomach. We leave this task to our biological colleagues. 2.We draw a sketch of f(t)as shown in rightmost panel of Figure G.10 and extend the taxis in the negative direction. At the point \u0000twe draw a line that just touches the curve f(t)at some point (i.e. a tangent line). The slope of this line is f0(t)for some value of t. 3.The value of tat the point of tangency is the optimal time to spend in the patch! The diagram drawn in our geometric solution (right panel in Figure G.10) is often called a \"rooted tangent\". We have shown that the point labeled tindeed satises the condition that we derived above for R0(t) =0, and hence is a critical point.404 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Checking the type of critical point. We still need to show that this solution leads to a maximum efciency, (rather than, say a minimum or some other critical point). We do this by examining R00(t). Recall that R0(t) =G(t) H(t) in terms of the notation used above. Then R00(t) =G0(t)H(t)\u0000G(t)H0(t) H2(t). But, according to our remark above, at the patch time of interest (the candi- date for optimal time), G(t) =0 so that (t+t)2=f00(t) (t+t). The denominator of this expression is always positive, so the sign of R00(t)is the same as the sign of f00(t). But in order to have a maximum efciency at some residence time, we need R00(t)<0. This tells us that the gain function has to have the property that f00(t)<0, i.e. has to be concave down at the optimal residence time. Returning to some of the shapes of the function f(t)that we saw in Figure 7.7, we see that only some of these lead to an optimal solution. In cases (1), (2), (4) the function f(t)hasnopoints of downwards concavity on its graph. This means that in such cases there is no local maximum. The optimal efciency would then be attained by spending as much time as possible in just one patch, or as little time as possible in any patch, i.e. it would be attained at the endpoints. G.6 Trigonometric functions and differential equations As we saw in Chapter 15, the functions sin(t)andcos(t)are related to one another via differentiation: one is the derivative of the other (with a multiple of the factor (\u00001)): dsin(t) dt=cos(t),dcos(t) dt=\u0000sin(t).FOR FURTHER STUDY 405 The connection becomes even clearer when we examine the second deriva- tives of these functions: d2sin(t) dt2=dcos(t) each of the functions y=sin(t),y=cos(t), we nd that the function and its second derivative are related to one another by the differential equa- tion (DE) d2y/dt2=\u0000y. Here the highest derivative is a second derivative, and we denote this a second order DE. More generally, we make the following observations: The functions x(t) =cos(wt),y(t) =sin(wt) satisfy a pair dt=wx. The functions x(t) =cos(wt),y(t) =sin(wt) also satisfy a related differential equation with a second derivative d2x dt2=\u0000w2x. These follow by the same reasoning, where the chain rule is applied in differentiation. Students of physics may recognize the equation that governs the behaviour of aharmonic oscillator , and see the connection between the circular motion of our point on the circle, and the differential equation for periodic motion.H Short Answers to Problems408 DI FFERENTI AL CALC ULUS FO R THE LI FE SCI ENCES Answers to Chapter 1 Problems Problem 1.1: Problem 1.2: (a) Stretched in ydirection by factor A; (b) Shifted up by a; (c) Shifted in positive xdirection by b.
