How to Use Herbal Medicine Herbs gently bring you body back into balance. The use of herbal medicine is a fundamental part of Classical Chinese Medicine where herbal formulas have been safely used for thousands of years. Herbal medicine has been used for centuries in the East and the West to aid in health, promote well-being, and prevent and treat disease. Herbal medicine helps to balance your being from the inside out. You can take them as delightful whole herb tea blends, handy concentrated powders, quick-absorbing liquids, or pre-made pills. Concentrated powders/granules Concentrated granules are raw herbs that have been brewed into tea and then dried to form crystals similar to instant coffee. You dissolve your formula in warm water to create a tea to drink daily for a prescribed length of time. Granule formulas provide a handy way to take your formula, especially if life or travel does not allow for the use of whole herbs. Whole herb teas Whole herb formulas are made from raw herb materials. Leaves, roots, stems, flowers, barks, minerals, and other natural ingredients are combined to provide the strongest most authentic form of herbal medicine. You cook your herbs in water to create a tea to drink daily for a prescribed length of time. Whole herb formulas provide a full experience of the senses. You get to see, smell, touch, and taste the herbs \u2014bringing you closer to the healing properties of your herbal allies. Liquids/tinctures Liquid herbal formulas, also known as tinctures, are raw herbs that have been soaked in water or alcohol to extract the active ingredients. The raw herb is discarded, leaving a powerful herbal-infused liquid. You add drop doses of the liquid to warm water to expel the alcohol and create a tea to drink daily, for a prescribed length of time. Liquid herbal formulas are easy to take and are quickly absorbed for maximum effect with little effort. Pre-made pills Pre-made pills are raw herbs that have been made into a tea, and then dried, ground, and added to capsules or pressed into pellets, balls, or tablets. Pre-made pills are specifically prescribed for you; however, this form of herbal medicine can not be as specific, as they are pre-made and the specific herbs or dosages of specific herbs within the formula cannot be altered. Pre-made pills are easy to take and travel well, whether to work or around the world. Custom Herbal Formulas Prescription formulas are blended on site specifically for you and your needs. Chinese herbs are rarely prescribed as single herbs but rather in a synergistic blend to address your health concern as well as strengthen your constitution. Each herb has unique healing properties useful for various conditions. A Chinese herbal formula blends together specific herbs together that work in concert to strengthen the healing properties of each herb within the formula. Also the strong effects of one herb can be blended specifically to be softened by another herb in the same formulation. Creating the perfect formula is like making any masterpiece. Combining and balancing flavors, textures, and qualities is important so that the outcome is a perfect blend in which all the pieces work together in a way that could not be achieved by any one piece alone. Combining herbs in this way makes your blend a unique formula, not merely a pile of single herbs sitting at the bottom of your cup. Herbal formulas are dynamic and are designed to change as you change. This ensures that what you need now is being addressed now. Our herbs are purchased from reputable farmers and distributors with trusted reputations for providing high-quality herbs that are pure, effective, and free of heavy metals or other contaminants. Our cruelty-free herbs do not contain any endangered species and are not tested on animals. "}
