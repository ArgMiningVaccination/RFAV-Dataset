Forty percent of individua ls with a debilitating injury or illness, who use dietary supplements, adhere to the label recommendations designed for individuals without a debilitating injury or illness.\u00b9 The recommendations advertised on dietary supplement labels may not consider spec ific types of injuries or illnesses or the energy requirements for specific injuries or illnesses; therefore, may not reflect accurate information for individuals with a debilitating injury or illness. Cancer patients and individuals with a spinal cord inj ury may use supplements to boost the immune system and promote healing; however, supplements have the potential to interfere with the effectiveness of treatment, therapies, and medication. Eating whole foods provides the body with vital vitamins, minerals , energy, and health promoting chemicals such as antioxidants. A healthy mix of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low -fat dairy products is a sufficient way to meet the recommended daily allowances for vitamins and minerals. Dietary supplem ents are an insufficient substitute for a well-balanced diet. Food contains a mixture of nutrients that interact to produce health benefits (such as vitamin D and calcium). Many nutrients do not provide benefits independently; they work in unison with othe r nutrients to provide health benefits. Achieving a proper balance of vitamins and minerals is achieved by consuming a well -balanced diet.
