In view of supporting WHO in the development of WHO benchmarks for training in Yoga, Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi, has been designated as WHO Collaborating Centre in Traditional Medicine (Yoga)-IND 118 in India. MDNIY, as the collaborating centre for traditional medicine (Yoga), aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine through modern science, research, and technology to improve the health and wellness of people and make preventive and curative healthcare, affordable and also accessible to all. The objectives of the WHO Collaborating Centres are diverse and include the collection, and dissemination of information on Yoga, standardization of terminology, methods, and procedures, generating evidence- based information on the safety, quality, and cost-effectiveness of traditional medicine products and therapies, development, and application of appropriate technology, provision of reference substances and other services, participation in collaborative research as well as capacity building through various training programmes. The book, \"Yoga for Geriatric Population\" extensively discusses about Yogic view of aging and old age in ancient classics and epidemiology and discusses the geriatric population ratio at the global level. This document gives an insight about various physical health issues, such as arthritis, indigestion, constipation, etc., faced by old age people system-wise. It explains various psychological issues such as dementia, depression, alzheimer's disease, etc., which are more common in old age people. The manuscript discusses social and security issues in the geriatric population like loss of social roles & esteem, depleted social networks, self-neglect, etc. The publication also educates about the rehabilitation approaches in various conditions generally found in elderly people and deals with understanding the Yogic concept of diet, micro & macronutrients, and the nutritional well-being of an elderly person. Furthermore, the book convoluted the role of Yoga in geriatric health, the method of instruction of Yoga practices, Yoga protocol for the elderly population, and evidence-based research on the elderly population. This book may serve the purpose of integrating the philosophy of Yoga with our daily practice of Yoga through a systematic but simple approach following WHO guidelines. This publication shall be a valuable contribution to the contemporary works on Yoga, acquiring global acceptance and validation. The language and explanations are simple and serve as an introduction for beginners who are looking to learn the unique practice of Yoga. I hope the publication will be very useful for Yoga enthusiasts, particularly the geriatric population and the inquisitive minds searching for timeless truths in modern-day lifestyle. Dr. Ishwar V.

ANNEXURES 80YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India10 YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India1 Ageing is a universal process and it affects every human being in the world, both physically and psychologically. It is a process that begins with conception, but in practice, ageing is regarded as that phase in life when body functioning begins to lose its adaptive response to stress, which leads to an increased risk of age-related diseases. It is a by-product of demographic transition1, the change from high fertility to low mortality rates. The mental health of elderly people, especially the high incidence of geriatric depression, has become an issue of increasing concern with the rapid growth of the ageing population. Old age is an unavoidable reality and is a community need. Ageing has different dimensions, such as social, behavioural, psychological, morphological, and molecular. Elderly people face several problems such as deteriorating physical health, financial issues, feeling of negligence, loss of importance in the family, and those related to the environment. These problems further add to the feelings of loneliness, being undesired or unwanted, being inadequate, and obsolescence of skill and education. Expertise in these aspects is interdependent and inductive in nature. Each one of these aspects may affect the quality and quantity of the problems in other categories. The organic process of ageing is termed Senescence1 ; the medical study of this process is known as Gerontology2; the study of diseases afflicting the elderly is referred to as Geriatrics3. The chronological age denoted as 'old age' varies depending on the culture and history. Thus, old age is a 'social construct' rather than a definite 'biological stage'4 (Salokangas and Joukamaa, 1991). The term 'old age' normally refers to an appearance of frail, hunched, wrinkled, toothless with a dribbling mouth, and uncontrollable bladder and bowels. Therefore, a majority of old people would expect and desire an early death instead of extending the sustenance of life rather than living a prolonged, crippled, and dependent life. However, growing old is an inevitable part of the life cycle. The demographic trends indicate that a strong group of the population above 65 years of age is gradually building up, challenging the medical world and pressurising the governments by way of increased costs of health services (9 times more than young individuals) (Kinsella, K. G., & Phillips, D. R. 2005). As old people have a limited capacity to regenerate, their vulnerability to sickness and various anomalies is more as compared to that of young adults. It is a terminal phase of the human life cycle referring to an age nearing or surpassing the 'life expectancy'. Generally, old-aged persons are denoted by various terms as: 1. Old people (normal worldwide usage) 2. Seniors (America) 3. Senior citizens (Britain and America) 4. Older adults (used in social sciences) 5. Elderly people or elders (in many cultures, including aboriginals), etc. 1 Demographic transition is a phenomenon and theory which, refers to the historical shift from high birth rates and high infant death rates in societies with minimal technology, education (especially of women), and economic development, to low birth rates and low death rates in societies with advanced technology, education and economic development, as well as the stages between these two scenarios.

Chronological time plays a major role in its determination in the developed world. Usually, an age between 60 and 65 years is believed to be the starting of old age, which is more or less equivalent to the age of retirement in most developed countries. At the same time, chronological time has either little or no importance in the meaning of old age in many developing countries. There are some other more significant socially constructed meanings of age depending on the roles assigned to older people. In some cases, it is the loss of roles accompanying physical decline which is significant in defining old age. Thus, in contrast to the chronological milestones that mark the stages of life in the developed world, old age in many developing countries is seen to begin at the point when an active contribution is no longer possible (Gorman, 1999). This classification of age varied between countries and in time spheres which reflected many instances of social class differences or functional capabilities related to the workforce; however, more often than not, the classification of age was a reflection of the prevailing political and economic situation. Often this definition is linked to the age of retirement, which, in some instances, was lower for women than men. This transition in livelihood became the basis for the definition of old age, which occurred between the ages of 45 and 55 years for women and between the ages of 55 and 75 years for men (Thane,1978). The characteristics that distinguish old age are both physical and mental. Looking at the distinction in the marks of old age and middle age, legal scholar Richard Posner suggests that, as an individual transition into old age, he/she can be thought of as different persons 'time-sharing' the same identity (Posner, 1997). These marks may not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Instead, they occur at different rates and orders for different people. Thus, marks of old age can easily vary between people of the same chronological age. One basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is the 'slowness of behaviour' (Birren and Fisher, 1995). This 'slowing down principle' finds a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance (Kausler and Kausler, 2001). At the moment, there is no standard numerical criterion defined by the United Nations (UN); but the UN agreed cut off 60+ years to refer to the older population.5 Old Age in Ancient Classics The Sanskrit word for old age is Jara. The process of becoming old is known as Jara, derived from the root Jri -the act of wearing out or wasting. Vayu Purana personified it as The Daughter of Death.6 Ancient Vedic texts, Ayurveda, and Indian tradition have considered the life span to be of 100 or more years and have praised an active and healthy life as referred a life span of 116 years and states that the duration of Vriddha Avastha or old age is of 48 years. Acharya Sushruta believes that Vriddha Vaya (old age) stretches to 30 years (71-100 years of age). However, the Hani or the degenerative phase, starts from the 41st year of life. It is also stated that during old age, a gradual decrement occurs in Dhatu (body tissues-components), Virya (potency), Indriya (sensory and motor apparatus), Bala (strength), (enthusiasm/zeal) occurs. Along with that, Khalitya (alopecia), Valita (wrinkling of the body), Kasa (cough), 5 www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en (last accessed on 6 February 2017). 6 www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=0413-414 (last accessed on 24, September 2018)YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3 Shvasa (breathlessness) etc., also occur. Acharaya Sharangadhara describes the gradual depreciation of various aspects of the body in different decades of life as given below (Dwiwedi et al..,1993). Decadal period of life First decade of life Balya (Childhood) Second decade of life Vriddhi (Growth) Third decade of life Chhabi (Beauty) Fourth decade of life Medha (Intellect) Fifth decade of life Tvak (Health of skin) Sixth decade of life Drishti (Vision) Seventh decade of life Shukra (Potency/libido) Eighth decade of life Vikrama (Gait/valour) Ninth decade of life Buddhi (Wisdom) Tenth decade of life Karmendriya (Activities - Motor apparatus) The Yogic View of Ageing The Yogic concept of ageing is unique. As per this concept, there is a life-and youth-sustaining nectar- like liquid oozing from the place of Soma (moon); it travels through the Talu (palate) and reaches the Nabhi (navel), and gets absorbed there. Nabhi is known as the place of Surya (sun). This fluid is known by many names, such as Sara, Amrita , and Amaravaruni . The constant downward flow and the absorption/ destruction of this fluid causes decay or degeneration of the body. The wastage of this fluid is regarded to be the cause of mortality in human beings (Digamberji and Jha, 2001). References 1. Birren J E and Fisher L M. 1995.

This growth in the number of elderly people, mostly due to an increase in the overall population figure, is also largely influenced by a decline in the leading causes of mortality. Such demographic changeovers reverberate in society, especially due to a rise in the need for medical care and dependency. This is expected to increase in the time to come (Lutz, Sanderson, and Scherbov [2008]; Park [2015]). The epidemiological and demographical perspectives prompt policymakers and society to be prepared for generating proper avenues in the structure and function of the health care system as well as the provisions for social protection. It is apparent that such alarms were missed to be heard at the due time in the past; as a result, the health-care system for the elderly today has a challenge for society. An increase in chronic morbidity is not the only consequence of a large number of people reaching an advanced stage of old age. They will be more susceptible to various disorders as well. Decrement in functional abilities as well as social and psychological problems, affect the parameters of their well- being and quality of life. Epidemiology has made further contributions to a better understanding of the health status and functional capabilities or insufficiencies of elderly people, thus trespassing the demographic focus of just calculating and projecting the number of elderly in society (Lutz, Sanderson, and Scherbov [2008]). Geriatric epidemiology approaches these challenges by studying the health, functional status, and quality of life of representative populations of individuals, ideally throughout the entire life span. The results of these population-based studies have often generated interventions aimed at improving the lives of millions of older individuals (Luigi Ferucci, 2008). Epidemiology The World Health Organization (WHO) says Population ageing is a triumph of humanity but also a challenge to 'society' (WHO, 2002) . Worldwide, the number of persons over 60 years is growing faster than any other age group. The number of this age group was estimated at 688 million in 2006, projected to grow to almost 2 billion by 2050 (WHO, 2018). By that time, the population of older people will be much larger than that of children under the age of 14 years for the first time in human history. Moreover, the oldest segment of population, aged 80 and above is prone to falls and their consequences. This 80-plus segment is expected to represent 20% of the older population by 2050. It is noteworthy that the world is on the verge of a demographic milestone. Young children have always outnumbered the number of elderly (aged 65 or older) since the beginning of the recorded history but now the condition is going to be just the opposite, where the elderly population will outnumber children under the age of 5 years. Owing to a decrease in the fertility rate and remarkably increasing life expectancy, the ageing of the population is g oing to continue and will also accelerate (Figure1). EPIDEMIOLOGY 02YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India5 Figure1. Young children and older people as a percentage of the global population: 1950-2050 Source: United Nations. World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision. (Available at: http://esa.un.org/ unpd/wpp.) The number of people aged 65 or older is projected to grow from an estimated 524 million in 2010 to nearly 1.5 billion in 2050, with most of the increase in developing countries. Thus, developed countries have the most older people, and less developed countries have the most rapidly ageing population (United Nations, 2004). Most developed nations have had decades to adjust to their changing age structures. It took more than 100 years for the French population aged 65 or older to rise from 7% to 14%. In contrast, many less developed countries are experiencing a rapid increase in the number and percentage of older people, often within a single generation (Figure 2). Figure 2.The speed of population ageing time required or expected for the percentage of population aged 65 and above to rise from 7% to 14% Source: Kinsella K, He W. 2009. An Aging World: 2008. Washington, DC: National Institute on Aging and U.S. Census BureauYOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India6 Thus, it is quite evident that the developing countries will need to quickly adjust and adapt to this new reality; and lesser developed nations must focus on framing fresh policies for agencies that provide financial securities and for those agencies that provide health and social care needed by the elderly population. The geriatric population also will suffer from the lack of extended period, of economic growth as experienced by the ageing societies of the West, i.e., some countries would grow old before they become rich. In some countries, the number of people entering older age will pose a challenge of different dimensions in terms of building national infrastructure as a whole and the health-care system in particular. Figure 3 captures this numeric surge in older people in the world's two most populous countries: China and India. Figure 3. Growth of the population aged 65 and older in India and China: 2010-2050 Source: Kinsella K, He W. 2009. An Aging World: 2008. Washington, DC: National Institute on Aging and U.S. Census Bureau China's older population (over age 65) will likely swell to 330 million by 2050 from 110 million in 2010. India's older population of 60 million in 2010 is projected to exceed 227 million in 2050, an increase of nearly 280% (WHO, 2010). References 1. Luigi Ferucci, Francesco G. Jack M, Guralnik. 2008.

YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India7 As the body starts growing old, a gradual decay in the body tissues and other aspects sets in. This is usually due to a decrease in the capacity for regeneration and lower nutritional levels. The body of elderly people begins to show various signs and symptoms pertaining to various systems of the body. Although it is not necessary that all elderly people show the same signs and symptoms that are identical to each other, the majority of them show some or a number of signs and symptoms. Some of them are described below. 1. Musculoskeletal system Conditions afflicting the musculoskeletal system are especially frequent in elderly people. Identification of potential rheumatic consequences of inter-current medical conditions and the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases of geriatric patients require special attention (Kasper et al.., 2016). A few specific medical issues afflicting the musculoskeletal system in elderly persons are listed below. a. Bone and joint: As the age grows, the bones tend to become thin and shrink in size, which may be reflected in the loss of height, changes in posture in many people, stooping, and increased susceptibility towards diseases related to bones and joints such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.1 b. Mobility impairment or loss: Owing to mal-alignment of the bones and joints and a decrease in the tone and power of the muscles, 14% of elderly people between the age of 65 and 74 and 50% of those over 85 years of age are seen to be affected by impaired mobility.2 This condition not only affects the physical body of elderly people but has serious psychological and social consequences as well (Gary McCleane, et al.., 2006). c. Pain: With the increase in age, pain is a symptom that afflicts old people around 25% of the time and reaches up to 80% of those who are either hospitalized or in nursing homes (Kasper et al.., 2016). In most cases, such pains are either rheumatological or malignant (K. Park, 2015). d. A wide range of articular and non-articular diseases-fibrositis, myositis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and spondylitis of the spine - affect elderly persons (Pistelli et al., 2003). 2. Respiratory system The respiratory system also undergoes degenerative changes with increasing age. Some changes from which the lung suffers in the old age areas are listed below (Heart Health, 2011). a. Decrease in peak airflow and gas exchange b. Decrease in lung functions like vital capacity c. Weakening of the respiratory muscles d. Decrease in the potency of lung defence mechanisms e. Chronic mucus hyper-secretion (CMH) (US Health Services, 2011) 1 The Normal Aging Process.

Circulatory system Like other systems, the organs of the circulatory system are also affected by old age. The problems may be enlisted as under: (Shamburek et al. ., 1990, Heart Health, 2011). a. Angina b. Arrhythmia c. Anaemia d. Arteriosclerosis e. Congestive cardiac failure f. Coronary artery diseases g. High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension h. Aortic stenosis i. Transient ischemic attack j. Deep vein thrombosis k. Varicose veins l. Aneurysms m. Peripheral vascular diseases n. Heart ailments (Tanvir et al.., 2010). 4. Digestive system About 40% of the time, digestive disorders marks an old age. These include the ones listed below. (Grassi, M et al.., 2011) a. Decreased ability to eat enough b. Decreased capability to absorb nutrients c. Constipation d. Bleeding e. Diverticulosis f. Gastro-oesophageal reflux diseases (GERD) g. Polyps h. Peptic ulcer diseases i. Atrophic gastritis j. Lactose intolerance k. Seniors who have diabetes would have digestive disorders like gastroparesis. l. An elderly buccal cavity may have a reduced proportion of saliva, along with decreased oral hygiene, it may increase the chances of tooth infection and decay in old age. 5. Nervous system a) Gait change: Owing to senile changes in the musculo-skeletal and nervous systems, the gait of the elderly changes with increasing age. The velocity slows, the double stance time increases, and, at times, it also appear s like a person is walking on ice (JamesO, 2016). YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India9 b) Essential tremor: Owing to weakening neurological conditions and support from muscles and tendons, an elderly person suffers from tremors in a part of the upper body. This condition worsens with growing age. Due to this, the performance of daily routine, particularly fine work, is adversely affected (Sullivan, K. L.2004). c) Falls: In old age, due to varied reasons, balancing the body in various activities becomes a problem leading to falls. This increases the risk of injuries from falls in elderly people. This becomes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for elderly people (Finlayson ML, 2010). 6. Uro-genital system a. Incontinence of urine is one of the most common problems in old age (Ouslander, J.G., 1981). b. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). (Ballentine Carter H, 1990). c. Andropause or semenopause, where a male struggles to perform sexual activities (Matsumoto M, 2002). d. Menopause, where females undergo a lot of changes leading to such symptoms as hot flushes, mood swings and excessive or less or painful menstrual bleeding (Monteleone P , et al.., 2018). e. The sexual drive in both sexes decreases after the active fertile period is over (Todd B. Nippoldt, 2015). At the same time, the growing body of research on sexual behaviours and desires of the elderly does not fully agree with the 'asexual' image of older people. The fact that people in the age group of 75-102 years continue to experience sensuality and sexual pleasure gives credence to the growing research on this topic (BretschneiderJ.G. 1988). Besides this, the sexual behaviour of the elderly includes sexual thoughts, fantasies and erotic dreams, masturbation, oral sex, vaginal and anal intercourse, etc., (DeLamater. J, 2012). 7. Endocrine system The ageing process leads to a gradual decline in the functions of endocrine glands that secrete various hormones. Malfunctioning of endocrine glands affects the secretion of respective hormones, which can cause various ailments such as the ones listed below (Chahal, H.S, 2007, Karasek, M. (2004). a. Melatonin: Sleeplessness, etc. b. Dopamine: Tremors, etc. c. Insulin: Diabetes Sex hormones: Andropause and menopause e. Suprarenal gland-related hormones: Weak immune responses, etc. 8. Immune system: Senescence affects the immune system leading to several disorders. (Fuentes E et.al., 2018, Akha A A,. 2017) a. Diminished immune response b. Increased risk of autoimmune disorders c. Slower healing process d. Increased risk of cancers, etc. YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India10 9. Skin-related issues Skin is an important physical marker of old age. Various senile changes occurring in the integumentary system, as listed below, may be observed (Chang CH et.al, 2017., Vary JC Jr, 1999). a. Loss of skin elasticity b. Dryness of the skin c. Wrinkled skin d. Thinning of hair e. Balding f. Greying of hair 10. Special senses and other functions The elderly population is also affected by diminishing functions of the special senses. This may be summed up as given below. a. Vision: Presbyopia hinders reading abilities in low light and small print, which usually occurs by the age of 50 years. Impairment in the reading speed and ability to locate objects may be observed (Sheeladevi S, et al.. 2019). Cataract is another common visual problem in the elderly (Krishnaiah S, 2018). b. Hearing: Old age adversely affects the sense of hearing by the age of 75 and above; 48% of males and 37% of females encounter impaired hearing (Davis A et al.., 2016). This condition of partial hearing loss is predominantly seen to damage communication between the elderly and young people (Reiss M, 2002). c. Gustation: The functioning of taste buds diminishes, marking the onset of senility. This, in turn, impairs the taste of food, food intake as a whole, and reception of proper nutrition (Sergi G et.al, 2017). d. Thirst perception: The perception of thirst also decreases in elderly people, and it has been observed that above the age of 85, 41% of the elderly drink insufficiently (Volkert D et.al, 2005). e. Voice: As the vocal cords become weak and vibrate more slowly, the voice in old age tends to become weak (\u00c7iyiltepe M, 2017). f. Sleep: A sound sleep at night does not usually happen in old age in more than 55% of cases, which may result in day-time sleepiness. Almost 88% people reported sleep-related complaints with a mean age of 74 in a study of 9000 persons (McCall, W. V. 2004). References 1.

J Nutr Health Aging. 9 (5): 305-9.YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India13 While defining health, WHO has laid an emphasis on psychological well-being also. As a person crosses the limit of youthful years, the mind and body undergo certain changes, which may be the starting point for the psychological issues of old age. Mental disorders afflict about 15% of people aged 60+ according to WHO estimates (WHO, 2016). Another survey carried out in 15 countries reported that mental disorders of adults interfered with their daily activities more than physical problems (Allyn & Bacon, 2010). These may be summarised as under. Reduced mental and cognitive ability: (Timothy A, 2009). The overall degenerative phenomenon induces reduction in the mental and cognitive abilities of seniors, leading to various problems; some of which are listed below. 1. Dementia: Dementia is a general term used to denote memory loss and other intellectual abilities that are serious enough to interfere with the daily life of a person. Its prevalence increases in old age from about 10% at an the age of 65 years to about 50% over the age of 85 (Jacoby S, 2011). It is estimated that 47.5 million people worldwide are living with dementia (Chertkow H, 2018). There is a decrease in the speed of encoding storage, and retrieval of the received information in old age due to memory loss. Further, people with dementia take more time to learn new information (Carrol JA, 2018). 2. Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's disease accounts for almost 50%-80% of dementia cases. A demented behaviour can include wandering, physical aggression, verbal outbursts, depression, and psychosis (Ganapathi HB, G.J, 1996)According to Coxet al..(2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e., 'deprejudice'). When people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rate of depression as they get older. (K. Park, 2015). The suicide rate is highest due to depression among the 65-plus population (Avasthi A, 2018). 4. Anxiety: Anxiety disorders including, phobias, social anxiety, etc., are psychological issues centred on the feeling of fear and may sometimes include panic attacks. They are often triggered in elderly people because of life changes (Tajikabad M, et. al, 2017). 5. Substance abuse: As ageing comes with many physical and psychological changes, people may find it difficult to cope with them. This may lead them to turn to various substance abuse rather than seeking support from the immediate society. Life changes, stress, depression, and anxiety may trigger this attitude further (Diniz A et. al, 2017). 6. Incompetence: The fragility of the body and impairment in adventures or fine work renders an elderly person to be dependant, and this induces the feeling of incompetence and worthlessness (Laura E, 2010). 7. Caution: As an elderly starts knowing the decreased functionality, ability, and capacity to perform different tasks, a natural sense of extra caution creeps in. This is further supported by the thought that old people have less to gain and more to lose by taking undue risks in comparison to young people (Richard A, 1995).PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES RELATED TO GERIATRIC POPULATION 04YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India14 8. Fear of crime: The fear of crime is sometimes a bigger concern than finances or health, especially among frail elderly people. This fear becomes a major reason for them to restrict their activities despite the fact that younger people become victims of crime more often than old people (Laura E, 2010). References 1.

Retrieved 2016-04-04.YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India15 Owing to increasing psychophysical limitations, older people have many disorders and disabilities as compared to younger ones. In particular, problems related to social life security and its influence on the life, risk, and experience of illness are seen more in elderly people (Kaplan DB, 2015). Such social issues may be categorised under different captions as listed below (Smith-Ruiz D. 1985, Dury R, 2014). a. Loss of social roles b. Loss of esteem c. Limited economic resources d. Depleted social networks e. Self-neglect f. Devaluation Loss of Social Roles During an active life in younger days, every person shoulders various responsibilities and acts in different roles in various capacities. This helps in building the importance and esteem of a person keeping him/ her worthy and fit. However, this worthiness and fitness come at the cost of his/her leisure time. With the gradual onset of senescence, a person has slowly drifted away from such responsibilities, designations, and importance. Though the elderly people seem to become more respected and more designated but in reality, their actual active input decreases; this would make them feel that their social roles are gradually decreasing. Loss of Esteem Esteem is built with the confidence a person gains because of one's capabilities and sequential successes in various sectors of life. As one moves towards senility, the physical and mental capabilities start diminishing, and a person may not succeed in his/her actions as frequently as he or she is used to during younger days. This condition shakes the roots of confidence leading to loss of esteem. Limited Economic Resources When people are young, they work for their livelihoods and are easily able to meet financial requirements. As they advance in age and retire from their active life, their physical strength decreases, as also the capacity to work. This situation eventually leads to a decrease in financial earnings, affecting their psychological and social status. Depleted Social Networks Old age not only induces physical and psychological limitations but also restricts the capacity of a person to socialise and even to communicate, at times. The fragility of the body and the extra sense of caution limit elderly people to from carrying out frequent journeys also. This results in the depletion of their social networ ks. SOCIAL AND SECURITY ISSUES IN GERIATRIC POPULATION 05YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India16 Self-neglect Self-neglect means not caring for one's own self. It can include ignoring personal hygiene, not paying bills, not maintaining the integrity or cleanliness of the home, not obtaining or preparing food (leading to under nutrition), not seeking medical care for potentially serious symptoms, not filling medical prescriptions or taking drugs, and skipping follow-up visits. Devaluation The value of a person depends on the capabilities and contributions that the person makes in the physical, psychological, financial, emotional, and social spheres of life. A young person is more capable in all those fields, and it remains so till the age of retirement from active life, work, etc. When a person starts feeling that his/her value has decreased, the society and family also (at times) neglect such a person who has lost their job, designation, power, etc. Once the leading persona of the family ceases to be so, and the place is taken over by someone else, a feeling of devaluation dawns in the minds of such people.

The scope of rehabilitation is wide, and it includes acute and chronic cases. This definition embodies various aspects, including the following: a. Impairment(specific deficit) b. Activity limitation c. The resultant limitations in the functional capacity due to impairment d. Participation restrictions affecting the quality of life e. Damaged system and its impact f. Damaged system and its impact on other body systems g. Psychological attitude h. Immediate material environment (e.g., clothes) i. The near environment (e.g., housing, equipment) j. Distant environment (e.g., shops, social outlets) Therefore, comprehensive rehabilitation tends to include all of the above and more. Such a rehabilitation process calls for interventions at all levels (listed above) and can only be carried out only through the involvement of multiple professionals such as a physician, rehabilitation nurse/caregiver, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, medical social worker, and recreational therapist (Weber, D. C.,1995). The same principles can be extrapolated to a wider group of conditions and are usually similar for different age groups. Besides, older patients, owing to their multiple needs and background frailty, may require lengthier and more complex processes as compared to similarly impaired younger people. Stages of rehabilitative process The rehabilitative process includes the following stages (Stuck AE, 1993): a. Assessment: identification and analysis of the problems b. Planning: analysis of the problem(s) and setting of goals c. Treatment: determination of the modes of intervention to reduce disability d. Evaluation/reassessment: checking the effectiveness of selected interventions and review e. Care: interventions to alleviate consequences of disability f. Advice: coping strategies for patients and caregivers Usually, three areas are covered in geriatric rehabilitation: (1) normal ageing due to disease and de- conditioning; (2) cardiovascular problems such as vascular disease and stroke; and (3) skeletal problems, including osteoarthritic condition and osteoporosis. With increasing age, patients often suffer REHABILITATION AND GERIATRIC POPULATION 06YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India18 from multifaceted physical, psychological, and emotional changes, which affect their levels of activities, function, and well-being. Rehabilitation helps elderly people to maintain their functional independence. Rehabilitation is essential in geriatric people, not only to maintain their own well-being but also for the society as it is related to socio-economic stability and development. Communication is equally essential to geriatric rehabilitation, especially for improving any sensory impairment, including those related to vision and hearing. A patient's health and longevity can be improved by preventing the incidents of falls and conditions like osteoporosis. Taking care of proper nutrition can avoid malnutrition and would promote healing along with vitalizing a patient to participate in a formal rehabilitation programme. Depression is commonly observed in elderly people due to loss of mobility and inability to perform activities of day-to-day life. The goals and outcomes of rehabilitation are adversely affected due to cognitive impairments such as delirium and dementia (Starr, L. 2013). One of the main components of geriatric rehabilitation is proprioceptive training, which will help in the prevention of falls and would promote maximum functional independence (Suetterlin, K. J. (2014). In intermediate care, where there is a requirement to provide hospital-based short-term intensive physical therapy, geriatric rehabilitation plays an important role. This kind of treatment may be for recovery of muscular skeletal function, specifically a recovery from joint, tendon or ligament repair and/or physical medicine and rehabilitation care when an elderly person get unsynchronized with their medications which results in deteriorating personal health or that which reduces their ability of independent survival (Starr, L. 2013). A few geriatric rehabilitation approaches in various conditions generally found in elderly people may be charted as follow. a. Geriatric musculoskeletal/orthopaedic rehabilitation: Orthopaedic rehabilitation is most commonly required in elders due to painful conditions associated with musculoskeletal injuries and dysfunctions. Some researchers have proved that walking, stair climbing, high-intensity resistance training, low-intensity resistance training; aerobic exercise, etc., can be useful rehabilitative approaches (Taaffe, D. R. 2000). Besides, these are helpful in the management of musculoskeletal pains in geriatric people. The utilisation of physical therapy, thermal agents, manual therapy, protective and supportive devices, Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS), cognitive behavioural therapy, mind-body therapy, warming-up exercise, cooling-down exercise, strengthening exercise, aerobic exercise, stretching exercise, flexibility exercise, etc., would prove to be good rehabilitative approaches (Subhedar, R. 2014). b. Geriatric cardiac rehabilitation: It was earlier believed that geriatric patients with cardiac problems should not be subjected to exercises, but some researchers have proved that a gradual onset of exercises such as aerobics, resistive training, and inspiratory muscles training, are actually helpful for geriatric cardiac rehabilitation (Baldasseroni, S, 2016). c. Geriatric Pulmonary rehabilitation: Physical therapy in such condition may include walking, aerobic exercise, stationary bicycling, stretching of muscles, etc., depending on the tolerance of the patients and required specialist interventions as and when necessary (Couser Jr, J.L, 1995). d. Geriatric Psychiatric rehabilitation: Old age induces many kinds of physical and functional limitations and changes in psychological and emotional conditioning. The near and distant environment, social adaptability and conditioning, etc., further add to the existing problem. As a whole, all these render an elderly person to have abnormal psychological conditioning. Geriatric psychiatric rehabilitation is required for elders suffering from chronic psychological problems. Such rehabilitation includes training interventions such as social skills training programme, combined skills training programme, health management training programme, functional adaptation skills training (FAST), cognitive behavioural social skills training (CBSST), and vocational rehabilitation (Pratt, S. I, 2008).YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India19 References 1.

Elsevier.YOGA FOR GERIATRIC Morarji Desai of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India20 Ageing induces various changes in the physio-psycho-social conditioning of a person. Such changes lead to a decreased sense of taste and smell, reduced appetite, loss of vision and hearing, impaired oral health, etc. The ramifications of ageing are many, but a few are listed below. The altered needs for energy may render the usual normal diet to be lacking in essential nutrients. Decreased physical activity may result in the progressive depletion of body weight and loss of appetite. Muscle loss (Sarcopenia) may give rise to decreased functional ability, which would require external assistance to carry out day-to-day activities. Psycho-social conditioning of an aged person may get disturbed. For example, the isolation/death of the partner would become one of the causes of decreased appetite. Altered environmental conditions such as financial position and change of residence may result in limited access to food or qualitatively and quantitatively poor diet. The cumulative effect of these factors would be progressive undernutrition (Visvanathan R, 2002. Chapman I M, 2004., MacIntosh C, et al.. 2006). Impaired nutrition can further leads to depleted immune response, decreased muscle strength, increased fatigue, inactivity, disturbed temperature regulation, impaired healing, improper regulation of fluids, electrolytes, and unusual psycho-social behaviour (Milne A C et al ., 2009,. Elia M et al.., 2009) In elderly people, dietary factors play a vital role in causing various diseases. Some of the dietary discrepancies may be persisting since the younger days also. It seems that dietary fats may be associated with the production of cancer of prostate, colon, and pancreas. Elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, glucose intolerance, etc., known as atherogenic risk factors, are considerably affected by dietary factors and may result in coronary heart diseases in elderly people. Degenerative disorders, such as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disorders, etc., are due to improper diet. It has been observed that micronutrients play an important role in promoting health and preventing the incidence of non-communicable diseases; deficiency of micronutrients is commonly found in older people (WHO, 2002). In a study carried out by researchers from 12 countries on 4507 people (75.2% female) with a mean age of 82.3 years, the prevalence of malnutrition in elderly people was evaluated using the mini nutritional assessment (MNA). The study found that in four different types of settings - though the number varied with considerable differences - the prevalence of malnutrition in the group of people under rehabilitation was 50.5%, those in hospitals it was 38.7%, in nursing home it was 13.8%, and in community it was 5.8%. The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 22.8%. The 'at risk' group had a prevalence of 46.2%. Thus, approximately two-thirds of the participants were either at nutritional risk or malnourished (Kaiser M.J. et.al 2010). The available data further suggest that one in four older adults is malnourished and two in four adults are at nutritional risk (Kaiser M.J. et. al, 2009). An unintentional weight loss in the elderly could adversely affect physical abilities and can be associated with increased health risks. (Visvanathan, 2009,.Ritchie, C. S, 2008). Nutritional well-being of elderly person Nutritional well-being is directly related to the physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and social status of an elderly person. It also positively influences independence, living arrangements, and diseases DIET AND NUTRITION FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION 07YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India21 management of the elderly. Good relationships with the members of the family as well as interpersonal relationships with caregivers and the community as a whole would go a long way in ensuring a better quality of life for an elderly person (Niedert, K. C. 2005). To achieve the goal of nutritional well-being, the diet of the elderly has to be rich in certain macronutrients and micronutrients as listed below. 1. Macronutrients a. Protein: Protein is the main building block of the human body. In old age, as the regenerative capacities decrease and the degenerative processes increase, it is important to maintain the protein level in the diet. Studies have proved that elderly people with high protein intake are able to retain lean muscle mass, a high-protein diet also works as an important measure to prevent falls. If the lean muscle mass decreases and the proportion of fat mass increases, there are chances of an increase in metabolic imbalances and related chronic conditions. Hence, a high protein diet would decrease the incidence of metabolic disorders in elderly people. It was also found that high protein intake is associated with lower bone loss, which would be beneficial in preventing orthopaedic problems (Hosten DK et. al, 2008. Hannan M T et. al, 2000). b. Fat: An elderly adult who is fit and within the range of normal body weight should minimize the intake of saturated fats to improve heart health. If a person is frail with a body weight lower than the healthy limit or with less appetite may require a diet that is rich in fat so as to increase the calorie input and aid weight gain (Chernoff, R., 2001). c. Omega 3 fatty acids: The diet of elderly people should be rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which are easily found in flax seeds and flax seed oil, walnuts, canola oil, and some types of fish. These fatty acids are believed to decrease inflammation, cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, recurrent myocardial infarctions, cardiac deaths, etc.), diabetes, and cognitive decline (Eveleth, P . B et.al, 1998. Pray, Leslie, et al.,2010). d. Fibres: Constipation and other problems related to bowel movements are commonly seen in elderly people. This may be attributed to various factors such as decreased muscle tone, diminished neural impulses, lack of a fibre-rich diet and less physical activity. A diet rich in fibre will minimise bowel issues and irritation as well as ensure the health and functioning of the digestive system. The fibre-rich sources of diet include wholegrain cereal, porridge, wholegrain bread, brown pasta and brown rice, fresh fruit and vegetables, and pulses (Chernoff, R., 2001). 2. Micronutrients Table 1 provides dietary recommendations for various micronutrients for the elderly. Table 1. Dietary Recommendations for Various Micronutrients (Montgomery, Stephanie C., et al.. 2014).

Vitamins a. Vitamin A: Studies have shown that Vitamin A deficiency is not a common phenomenon as only about 3.9% of elderly people are found with inadequate serum retinol concentrations (Carmem-Costa-do- Nascimento, Christiane, et al.. 2011). Elderly people who are deficient in Vitamin A may show higher risk of cancer and heart diseases, specifically deaths related to cardiovascular diseases (Brazionis L et. al, 2012). Sufficient Vitamin A intake would reduce the risk of hearing loss (Gopinath B et.al, 2011). Vitamin A is believed to decrease the risk of prostate cancer or be helpful in the early detection of it. Further, clinically Vitamin A has shown to slow down the progression of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Proper intake of Vitamin A also boosts the function of the immune system (Mondul A M et.al, 2011., Beydoun H A et.al, 2011., Ono K et. al, 2012., Wardwell T J et. al, 2008). Dietary sources: Animal and plant foods such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, squash and eggs and beef liver. Root vegetables and tubers are rich sources of Vitamin A. b. Vitamin B1: As per a clinical study, thiamine supplements to the elderly population have improved the quality of life decreased systolic blood pressure, induced some weight loss, improved sleep, and increased energy (Wilkinson T J et. al, 1997). Dietary sources: Vitamin B1 is found in legumes, whole grains, almonds, Bengal gram dhal, groundnut, gingelly seeds, liver of sheep, cauliflower, kale, yeast, eggs, etc., (Park K, 2015, Doets, Esmee L., et al.., 2013). c. Vitamin B12/Cobalamin: The deficiency of Vitamin B12 would result in megaloblastic anaemia and/or demyelinating neurologic disease, altered mentation, depression, and psychosis. Some studies have reported that there is a significant association of Vitamin B12 deficiency with the risk of dementia or global cognitive decline. O'Leary F et.al,2012., Gorrschlich M M, 2007). Dietary sources: The only reliable source of this vitamin is animal products such as milk. Microorganisms are the ultimate source of all naturally occurring B12 (Olsen A et.al, 2009). In European countries and the United States, meat is the most important contributor. Other dietary sources of Vitamin B12 is fortified cereals, fish, poultry, and eggs. Strict vegetarians are at a higher risk of developing this deficiency as compared to others (Tabacchi G et.al, 2009). d. Folic acid: The main symptoms of folic acid deficiency are megaloblastic anaemia and diarrhoea. This deficiency further induces the risk of osteoporosis, and decreased physical functions, particularly balance and gait, as well as the risk for stroke and cardiovascular diseases (Solomon, L. R. 2013, Ngtp et.al, 2 012).YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India23 Dietary sources : Dark leafy vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, peas, dairy products, eggs, sea food, poultry, and meat (Yang H T et.al, 2012., Park K,2015). e. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid and Dehydro ascorbic acid): Deficiency of Vitamin C may cause fatigue, muscle pain, and increased susceptibility to infection. Vitamin C is required for the proper functioning of the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system and for intestinal absorption of iron. This vitamin serves as an antioxidant and it reacts with superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in an aqueous environment. Vitamin C also plays a role in the biosynthesis of collagen, bile acids, carmitine and as a transmitter of epinephrine. Many disorders pertaining to the deficiency of this vitamin are observed in the elderly population. The classical syndrome generated by the deficiency of Vitamin C is known as scurvy, characterised by disorders in connective tissues leading inflamed and bleeding gums, joint effusions, anaemia, improper wound healing, and at times even death.xxx Vitamin C is also required for better physical performance (Saito K et.al, 2012). Dietary Sources: Fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruit, broccoli, strawberry, green peppers, cantaloupe, and tomato (WHO, 2004). Amla or Indian gooseberry is the richest source of Vitamin C both in fresh and dry conditions. Guava is another cheap and rich source of this vitamin (Park K,2015). f. Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) and Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3): Vitamin D is basically required for maintaining the levels of calcium and phosphors supporting the cellular processes. Recent findings have observed that it participates in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic and immune cell lines (Montgomery, Stephanie C., et al..2014). Worldwide, the deficiency of Vitamin D is commonly seen in the aged and institutionalised elderly people (Hilger J et.al, 2014). Dark-skinned older adults and those having less exposure to the sun also suffer from its deficiency (Institute of Medicine, US, 1997). It has also been observed that deficiency of Vitamin D in elderly people reduces their mobility, increases the risk of falls and fractures, as well as deaths by cardiovascular means (Boucher B.J, 2012). Normal levels of Vitamin D reduce the risk of cancer, infections, and metabolic diseases (Qin W et.al, 2013, Bouillon R et.al, 2013). Elders deficient in vitamin D have poorer cognitive function, and it is also associated with depression (Gschwind Y.J et.al, 2014, Lapid M I et.al 2013). Dietary sources : There are limited dietary sources containing natural Vitamin D. Sunlight happens to be its major source. Some animal products - particularly milk or fortified milk and fatty fishes like Salmon, Tuna, and Mackerel - contain natural Vitamin D (Moore C E et.al, 2014). Liver, egg yolk, some species of fish, and fish liver oil are other sources that provide Vitamin D (Park K, 2015). g. Vitamin E (Tocopherol and Tocotrienol): Vitamin E comprises eight compounds: ). The most active form is -tocopherol, which removes free radicals in the lipophilic environment, specifically in the cell membrane and helps to maintain their integrity (Devore E E et.al, 2010).The deficiency of Vitamin E results in the fragility of red blood cells, which leads to haemolytic anaemia the deficiency also results in the degeneration of nerve cells, which leads to peripheral neuropathies, destruction of posterior columns of the spinal cord, and ophthalmoplegia. The antioxidant properties of this vitamin are being studied, and some studies have shown that proper level of vitamin E reduces the risk of dementia (AlaviNaeini A M et.al). If proper intake of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and carotenes are done, the risk of global cognitive decline decreases in elderly people (Rafnsson S B et.al, 2013).Intake of Vitamin E above the recommended level may enhance the T cell function in aged animals and humans (Pae M et.al, 2012). It has also been observed that life expectancy increased by six months among those who were supplemented by Vitamin E (Hemila H et.al, 2011). Antioxidant vitamins like Vitamin E and Vitamin C are good for eye YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India24 health, slowing the progression of age-related cataract and delaying macular degeneration (Mathew M C et.al, 2012, Evans et.al, 2012). Dietary sources: There are many dietary sources that provide Vitamin E, such as nuts, seeds, green vegetables, and vegetable oils. Vitamin E is widely distributed in foods like vegetable oils, cotton seeds, sunflower seeds, egg yolk, and butter (Traber M G et.al, 2012). h. Vitamin K: Vitamin K helps in blood clotting and plays some role in bone health. There is some evidence to suggest that the rate of fracture in post-menopausal women can be reduced by Vitamin K (Cheung A M et.al, 2008). Evidence suggests that Vitamin K has a role in cognition and better memory performances (Presse N et.al, 2013). Dietary sources : Good natural food sources that provide Vitamin K are vegetables like spinach, asparagus, broccoli, beans, soya beans, strawberries, eggs and meat. Cow's milk is a richer source of Vitamin K (Schurgers, L. J., 2007). B. Minerals and trace elements a. Iron: Iron is one of the most needed minerals useful for numerous important functions of the body. Notably, it plays the role of carrying oxygen to tissues through haemoglobin and myoglobin. Iron, being associated with immune functions, the deficiency of iron increases the risk of infectious diseases more in elderly people. The lower level of iron may result in a poor supply of oxygen to tissues and may produce symptoms of iron deficiency, including hypochromic anaemia, fatigue, weakness, paleness, spoon-shaped nails, cheilosis, glossitis, headaches, and tachycardia (Ahluwalia et.al, 2004, Good win J S, 1995, Thomas DR, 2004). Dietary Sources: There are two forms of dietary iron: heme and non-heme iron. The former is easily absorbed in the abdomen and frequently found in beef, fish, poultry, and pork. The latter is found in plant sources such as beans, dried fruit, enriched grains, and fortified cereals (McCall K A, 2000). b. Zinc: Cellular metabolism is largely dependent on zinc. In more than 300 different enzymes, zinc is essential (Bogden JD, 2004). It is important for cell structure and regulatory functions, immune response, growth and development, neurological function, and reproduction. Even a mild deficiency of zinc can reduce immune function in elderly people (Nuttall J R, 2014). In elderly people, it is also associated with Alzheimer's disease, dermatitis, diarrhoea, depression, subdued appetite, and impaired taste (Shils M E, 2006). Dietary sources: The dietary sources that provide a good amount of zinc are beef, poultry, pork, fish, legumes, nuts, fortified cereals, and dairy products. c. Calcium: Various physiological processes such as muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and nerve impulse transmission, as well as those functions, which are an essential co-factor for multiple enzymes, have calcium as a vital element. Particularly for elderly people, the role of calcium in bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis is of primary importance (Institute of Medicine, US, 1997,. Ross A C et.al, 2011). Dietary sources: The best dietary sources providing calcium are milk, yogurt, and chillis. Smaller amounts of calcium are found in dried beans, kale, spinach, and tofu. In addition, food fortified with calcium are fruit juices, milk alternatives, etc. 3. Hydration Elderly people become reluctant to drink water frequently. This adversely affects many physiological functions, including the viscosity of blood and the movement of bowels in the intestines. Hence, the YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India25 elderly people may be encouraged to drink more water/liquids as the need may be (Pirlich, M., & Lochs, H. 2001). The above discussion not only brings forth the complexities in the nutritional status of elderly people, but also calls for continuous monitoring/supervision and individualized attention in every case. The Yogic concept of diet The macro and micronutrients and the caloric concepts of diet can be regarded as modern dietetics. However, ancient literatures are full of detailed description about diet, its components, and dietetics. Although Yogic texts do not specifically indicate any special diet for elderly people, the texts of Hatha Yoga has clearly mentioned about the Do's and Don'ts regarding diet during the initial phase of Yoga practice. It focuses on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of diet as well as the methodology of its preparation and consumption. As the science of Yoga and other ancient scriptures believe that the dominance of Sattva Guna is good for blissful existence, the components of Rajas and Tamas must be kept under strict check, which can be easily done through a selective diet. Further, the quantitative aspect also has been stressed through the concept of Mitahara (moderate eating) in ensuring good health and preventing many disorders (Digamber ji, 2001, Digamberji,1997,. Srisachandravasu R B, 1914). Mitahara: Eating wholesome food offered first to the Divine, with one-fourth of the stomach kept empty is Mitahara or moderate eating as per Hatha Yoga Pradipika I:59. The body needs energy to survive, so the Yoga practitioner needs to learn how to live on a proper diet in tune with Yogic discipline. Hatha Yoga texts provide guidelines on how to practice Mitahara. This includes eating only until three-fourths of the stomach is full to provide space for air and water to move the contents of the stomach. Eating only fresh, nutritious, and plant-based food is essential to achieve success in the Yogic path or discipline. Shrimad Bhagavad Gita talks about the different types of diets by people of different temperaments. The important aspects of it are mentioned below (Easwaran E, 1985). a. Foods that enhance longevity, increasing Sattva Guna, strength, health, happiness, and cheerfulness, which are juicy, unctuous, nourishing, cardiotonic, and palatable, are often liked by persons dominated by Sattvik temperament. b. Foods that are pungent, sour, and salty in taste, very hot, penetrative, dry, and acidic in nature are liked by people who are dominated by Rajasik temperament, and such foods produce pain, grief, and diseases. c. Foods cooked more than 3 hours before consumption, tasteless, putrid, stale, refused and impure in nature are liked by people who are dominated by Tamasik temperament. A detailed analytical study on 'Linkage of the Modern and Yogic concepts of food' carried out by Vaishali Agte et al.. (2007) confirms that the concepts of Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik diet have relevance to the references found in the classics regarding their nutritional status and the psycho-physical effects. After careful scrutiny of around 110 cooked eatables on scientific guidelines, it was derived that some foods listed under Sattvik may not contain the levels of micronutrients as per the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), but all other qualities of good food were found to be intact. The Rajasik and Tamasik also followed the same line. Usually, a person is conditioned by the type of diet eaten and the traditional belief suggests that there is a connection between the expression of moods/thoughts and the diet consumed. YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India26 Table 2 lists such foods that are common in Indian households divided as per the probable Sattvik , Rajasik , Tamasik qualities and their average micronutrient contents. Table 2.

YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India32 Old age should be regarded as a normal, inevitable biological phenomenon. Over the years, the ageing process has brought many changes in the life of an individual. One such change is the body becoming vulnerable to many problems due to lack of regenerative processes and an increase in degeneration. The psychological and psycho-social issues generated during the ageing process add complexity to its management. At the macro level, the ageing of citizens has its impact on a country's overall health condition, policies, and financial management. Therefore, governments across the world treat the issue of ageing of their citizens with all seriousness. For instance, On December 14, 1990, the United Nations General Assembly voted to establish October 1 as the International Day of Older Persons as recorded in Resolution 106 /45. International Day for the Elderly is celebrated every year on 1st October. This day is observed to focus on the importance of senior citizens who sometimes are neglected in our society. WHO adopted the theme \"Take a Stand against Ageism\" while celebrating the International Day for the Elderly on 1 October 2015 . All these messages were aimed at improving the quality of life of the aged. As per the United Nations, persons of 60+ years of age and older are defined as elderly (Bowling, A. 2005). Successful ageing is multi- dimensional in nature, with key ingredients as (a) avoidance of disease and disability, (b) maintenance of cognitive and physical functions, and (c) sustenance of social and productive activities. The science of Yoga, a practical spiritual science, empowers an individual to attain a state of holistic and integrated development in all aspects and at all levels. Various scientific studies have documented its potential to normalise the psycho-physiological functions of an individual. Yoga is basically a science that leads to ultimate liberation (Moksha ). The Yogic way of living provides a popular by-product in the form of attaining a dynamic state of health and well-being. However, this depends on the Karma of an individual manifested as the genetic predisposition and the conditioning of the environment in which one is born. The main focus or the central theme of Yoga happens to be the golden mean, locating the middle path, a constant drive for improvisation and moderation, and a harmonious homeostatic balance. Yoga, the uniting impulse of life, always thrives to create a union of diverse streams into a single powerful flow. The judicious practice of science generates inner balance of the mind that remains serene and stable even amidst chaos. This potent ancient science guides its followers to a clear path ensuring the enduring stability even when there are lots of external turmoils (Bhavanani, A. B. 2013). Mastery in Yoga can be achieved by anyone who may be young, old, very old, diseased or emaciated, if the practice is continued regularly without being lethargic and lazy (Digamberji S, 2001). This also suggests that the practice of Yoga can be undertaken and may prove beneficial for elderly people. Yoga, the science of union, guides an individual through a number of practical techniques and advises a proper lifestyle helping to attain and maintain a state of health and well-being. External (Bahiranga and Pranayama help to produce the social and physical health while Pratyahara and internal (Antaranga ) practices like Dharana and Dhyana work on producing psycho- spiritual health. Yoga, with special emphasis on the psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrine axis, functions towards harmonising all the systems of the human body. Yoga also intends to promote positive health, which would help an individual to overcome the health challenges during the whole span of life. This is a unique contribution of Yoga to modern health care as it carries out both roles - promotion of health and prevention of diseases. Further, it is cost-effective in nature, and it can be well integrated with other systems of medicines to benefit the sufferers (Stephens, I. 2017).ROLE OF YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION 08YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India33 Shifting from individual to universal self The science of Yoga emphasises universality, which is an antidote to modern human activities, which usually glorify the individuality. A person masked by ego will soon face the conditions of despair and depression, being overwhelmed by his own superficiality. Yoga, in contrast, visualises the universal aspect of spiritual nature and perceives the unity of the entire creation. Yoga helps one find an endless fountain of inspiration and bliss. In a nutshell, the practice of Yoga helps an individual to evolve from an 'I-centric' approach (Vyashti ) to 'We-centric' approach (Samashti ). Thus, it may be understood that having Yoga as a way of life leads to an immensely conscious and aware physical, mental, and emotional existence enables to gain conscious control over all aspects of life. This also happens owing to a practice of detachment where the work is for the sake of work only and not for any reward or presumptive gains. These attitudes will produce dexterity in all actions. Complete concentration and control are generated because of a continuous practice (Abhyasa /Sadhana). Detachment from the fruits of the action generates the greatest efficiency as an individual keeps aloof from competitive and goal-oriented thinking. These practices, as a whole, reform a person, and the individual self evolves to become a universal self (Bhavanani, Y. D. A. B.2013., Tolahunase, M,.2017). Holistic Approach of Yoga Yoga has a holistic approach towards life, which helps an individual to improve in all spheres of existence. The use of natural resources like sunlight, air, and water for various practices and careful observation of diet are suggestive of the all-round care that Yoga helps an individual through his/her daily requirements Yoga does so without manipulating the natural laws of rejuvenation and healing. It also clearly demarks the understanding and need of an 'exertion-relaxation' cycle for getting the ultimate balance within. With an increasing awareness about introvertedness, extrovertedness gradually subsides and leads an individual to depend less or no external means of entertainment and/or addictive substances. This benefits not just the personal health but social health also. Further, an understanding of the philosophy of Yoga enables one to develop inner peace and equanimity, which will help to decrease the suffering from pleasure or pain and other such dualities in day-to-day life. Decreasing or refraining from socialising will help in decreasing social problems, and regular introspection would help one to understand one's own true nature and bio-rhythmic patterns. This holistic approach will aid in reaching the goal of total health. Initiation of the Elderly to Yoga Practices Kavitha S and Kumudini Achchi (2015) in their study stated Yoga and Pranayamas were considered the cheapest means of gaining new strength and energy for the institutionalized elders in the modern technological era to have a stress-free life. However, the fact remains that a huge number of elderly people are devoid of this knowledge or do not have the inclination to start something new at that ripe age. At times, they may not have the required facilities or lack of initiation to start Yoga practices. Some simple suggestions or moderations in their daily activities may boost the process of going for Yoga practices. It is a fact that senior citizens need to have ample amount of rest and must avoid straining their joints and musculature as damage to the body may turn out to generate somatopsychic problems. Therefore, it is essential to counsel elderly persons to avoid high-impact activities as well as weight lifting (if they are not trained and used to it). They may be instructed to take short breaks while doing any prolonged activities like driving, watching TV or working on a computer, etc. Guidance about a healthy overall posture with the neck aligned to shoulders and spinal column also needs to be incorporated. Gentle stretching and strengthening practices involving breath and body, coordination such as Jathis , Sukshma , Sthula Vyayama , and other activities help to restore psycho-somatic harmony, which is the root cause of YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India34 many health issues. Such practices can usually be done by most older adults and seem to be a good way to introduce Yoga practices in a gentle and safe manner in the initial stages. This may then be fortified by inclusion of other simple and gentle Hatha Yoga practices, which helps to facilitate a psychosomatic balance. All such practices must be done with an awareness of the body and spine movements as well as conscious rhythmic breathing (Ingle, G. K., 2008). The thymus gland is important for the proper functioning of the immune system. In this context, twisting postures like Vakrasana create a healthy flow of vital energy (Prana ) into the heart centre (Anahata Chakra). The Brahma Mudra, done with breath sequence and appropriate vibrational sounds, such as AAA, OOO, EEE, and MMM, can relax and energise the neck region and relieve the frequent occurrences of pain in the neck. Along with that, it also energises the whole central nervous system with an enhanced flow of Prana, providing beneficial effects, namely, boosting self-confidence, mood, and memory. For elderly people, it is advisable to work with a partner in Yoga practices to remove phobias, gain self-confidence, and provide necessary physical support. It is important that the patterns of the body movement and breath must be well synchronised during Yoga practices. In the practice of Kriya or structured movements like Suryanamaskara, the lifting of the body is done on inhalation and lowered on exhalation. Some breathing patterns like Bhastrika (Bellow Breathing) are useful to strengthen the entire solar plexus area, including the diaphragm, which builds up stamina and facilitates internal cleansing of the organs and the circulating life force. Kapalabhati happens to be another dynamic breathing technique that enables the warding off of depressive conditions as it creates a sense of activation. The Suryabhedana and Ujjayi Pranayamas can also help in the activation of healthy well-being. The three locks (Mula-Uddiyana-Jalandhara Bandhas ) as well as the Ashvini Mudra act on revitalising the whole psycho-neuro-endocrine system and, thus, affect positively on depression. The Aum chanting (Pranava) and the Bee Sound (Bhramari ) Pranayama create an inner harmony resulting in the attainment of mental calmness and bliss, thus initiating the inherent regenerative processes. The pattern of breath has a direct correlation with the energy level, lifespan, state of mind, clarity of thought and quality of emotions (Ramanathan, M, 2014). Pranayama also helps in reducing hyper-reactivity to day-to-day tensions and thus enables senior citizens to relax better, which culminates in a better quality of sleep and enhanced quality of life. Yogic techniques of relaxation like Shavasana and Yoga Nidra help to remove stress, producing autonomic balance; they aid in correcting the faulty psychosomatic conditioning prevalent in elderly people. Practices like Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), Dharana (focused concentration), and Dhyana (meditation) work towards modulating the individual perspectives and normalising the higher functions, crafting a rational and positive attitude towards life. Focusing between the eyebrows (Antah or Bhrumadhya Trataka ) helps in activating the brow centre (Ajna Chakra), energising the neuro-endocrine axis. Dhyana (meditation) on energy centres (Chakras ), with a special focus on the heart centre (Anahata Chakra), would activate the thymus, thus potentiating the elderly against immunological issues as well as strengthening cardiac functioning. Repetitive recitation (Japa ) of AUM and Soham mantras are other potent methods for sharpening the focus (Bhavanani, Y. D. A. B. 2013). Yoga in Caring for the Caregivers Taking care of an elderly requires a lot of patience and perseverance as the conditions are usually irreversible, and pursuing someone to cope is hard. Further, the mood shifts, irritability, obstinate behaviour, etc., attitudes of the one being cared for - may generate feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, hopelessness, etc., in the caregiver. The caregiver also goes through physical, psychological, emotional, and economic strain and drain. Lack of time to rest, relax, and entertainment adds to this tally. Many a time, the caregivers may easily fall victim to depression and other problems. Yoga may prove beneficial YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India35 to such people. Proper understanding of the concepts of Karma (action), Dharma (code), Seva (service), Daya (mercy), Karuna (compassion), etc., along with some Yoga practices, may prove beneficial for the caregivers. To reiterate the point, Waelde LC et al..have stated in their paper, titled 'A pilot study of a Yoga based intervention for dementia caregiver stress', that a Yoga - meditation programme may be an effective intervention for the family or caregivers of an elderly person for enhancing the extension of services, coping and keeping one's stress levels to normal (Waelde LC,2014).

However, owing to varied reasons, they need to be cared for, supervised, and at times even kept motivated, especially children and elderly (Uma P , 2012). A child is often unaware of the requirements and long-term effects of different activities they indulge in. In the case of the elderly, although they have the maturity, knowledge, and experience of life, they tend to develop a casual approach and self-neglect towards health maintenance in their greying years of age. The physical, psychological, social and security issues worsen this condition. Therefore, today, there is a need to focus on healthy and graceful ageing, considering especially such factors as deteriorating ecological conditions and increasing life expectancy. The health benefits of regular Yoga practices are no longer a secret, if one goes by its increasing popularity and numerous evidence-based studies. It is one of the most cost-effective and easily adoptable methods for maintaining and regaining health, happiness, and harmony with minimal requirements and prerequisites. Further, it can be easily imbibed in one's routine lifestyle. The major difference between other methods of health maintenance and Yoga is that in other methods, an external support or device or assistance is required or an internal ingestion of some substance or drug is necessary, where the amount of self-responsibility and active participation of a person decreases comparatively. However, in the case of Yoga, everything depends on how regularly and devotedly an individual offers one's own self to do the necessary practices. As active participation is a prime requisite, the main concern is about the amount of time to be devoted and the psychophysical fitness and preparedness of the individual. A study carried out by Kavitha S and Kumudini Achchi (2015) stated that the majority of elders are well aware of the significance of Yoga and its positive health benefits and showed interest and readiness to practice Yoga. The elders also agreed that there are good opportunities to learn Yoga, but the outcome is less owing to lack of interest, continuous motivation, physical problems, etc. This is where the role of the caregivers, instructors, designing of the practice, etc., comes into play. Some healthcare providers also project that owing to their age, maintenance of health and wellness and activities related to prophylactic measures may not be much helpful for the elderly. On the contrary, Yoga is not an age-specific concept as it is required by all. Although a variety of chronic disorders may be causing serious defects, adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can actually delay such defects, as per some studies. Yoga for wellness and prevention of diseases has proved to be effective, especially in inducing a lifelong behavioral change, as indicated by research studies. As the elderly population is at a high risk of major diseases and defects, their health education needs to be handled with the utmost care by the members of health care community/units (Reicherter and Greene, 2005). Health education links directly to the promotion of health in both clinical and educational preparation fields (Choi et al.., 2010). The initial portion of Yoga practices falls under the category of education as the practitioners are taught and trained in Yogic aspects and practices. Senior citizens are regarded and respected in society. They have limitations due to decreased physical strength, flexibility, and with individually conditioned psychological responses. Therefore, the planning of Yoga practices and the mode of instruction to be given to them need special attention. Based on the findings of some studies on communicating with geriatric people, geriatric education, geriatric nursing, planning the Yoga interventions for randomized trials, etc., (Smith, 2006, Cornett, 2011, Karen J. Sherman, 2012), a methodology for the same may be charted out as given below.METHODS OF INSTRUCTION FOR YOGA PRACTICES IN GERIATRIC POPULATION09YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India37 1. Style/School of Yoga : Today, there are many styles/schools for imparting the knowledge of Yoga available in society. Keeping the necessity of an individual or the target group in mind, the most suitable style of performance must be selected, keeping safety and appropriateness in view (e.g., rigorous manner or calming manner). 2. Frequency and Duration: All bodies are not alike, and hence the requirement of everybody is different. This segment indicates the need of planning the frequency and duration of practices with regard to the duration and frequency of practice sessions. These aspects will depend on the requirement and conditions of the person or a given group. This level of planning will help address such questions as (a) how long should be the Yoga practice time in a day; (b) how long a given Asana should be performed; and (c) how many times in a day/week the practices must be repeated. 3. Yoga Practices: There are eight limbs of Yoga, according to sage Pantanjali and all are equally important for attaining spiritual bliss and self-evolution. However, their practice may be altered based on the health condition of the practitioner. For instance, a person suffering from back pain may need more focus on posture-related Asanas and a person with hypertension may need more meditative practices. 4. Specific Class Sequence: After deciding on the practices, it is necessary to set a sequence for them based on, for example, the need and condition of the practitioner and the time of the day/season. 5. Inclusion of Modification: Not all people are able to perform every practice uniformly. Therefore, keeping the physical limitations in mind, the required improvisations and modifications in the given practice/s may be incorporated in a way that the Yoga practice may yield proper potency and the benefit. The use of proper props and support devices may be required for a person with limited flexibility or the final posture may be improvised instead of avoiding the whole posture itself. 6. Instructors: The knowledge, skill, nature, and communication of an instructor/expert must be sound in all aspects so that the practitioner does not get a negative impact from the practices and his/her interest in doing Yoga is sustained. 7. Facilitation of home practice: The ultimate goal of Yoga is Kaivalya or merging with the Supreme, which would be adversely affected if the practices are always done in a group. Therefore, the practitioners are encouraged to do their practice at home as well. This will also test their ability to memorise and recall the practices, their names, and the methodology of doing the practices, thus helping an individual to evolve and be self-supportive. 8. Evaluation of the Effects: Training an elderly is a challenge in itself. Yoga practices are done to generate the desired results. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the progress made and benefits derived at regular intervals through proper documentation procedures, even through audio-visual means. Such evaluation would help to understand the effectiveness of the practice also. Besides the above considerations, the following points would make the instructions and Yoga training for elderly persons more meaningful. Prior to the starting of Yoga practice sessions, a detailed counseling must be done. The condition of the health of an individual must be examined, if required, needed medical advice must be asked for. Instruction/teaching should be imparted by using short, simple, and proper words and all ambiguities must be avoided. While instructing, instead of an authoritarian attitude, a calm and understanding approach must be adopted in communication. YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India38 The voice must be clearly heard with the correct pronunciation. The information must be repeated frequently till they are properly understood. Important parts of information or some specific important information should be written on cards. If required, pictorial information may also be prepared. Exaggerations in any form must be avoided. Judicious use of Maitri (friendliness), Karuna (compassion), Mudita (pleasuring), Upeksha (ignoring) must be imbibed to make the instructions effective (Goyanka. H, 2016). Yoga sessions should be kept short and may be repeated. All possible sources for the individual and his or her family should be used. Appropriate learning style for a given individual must be derived, and training must be organised in this direction. The training should be supported by visual tools such as videos. Assistance from the individual's family members, relatives, neighbours, and volunteers must be accepted and encouraged. The desire to learn and the joy of life must be kept alive through motivation and appreciation. There should be no frowning. An ever-smiling, positive, optimistic, and open-hearted attitude must be kept. The session must be conducted in an indoor, peaceful, serene, noise- and pollution-free environment. References: 1.

YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India39 Designing a generalised Yoga protocol for elderly people needs scrutiny of many aspects related to the physio-psycho-socio-spiritual aspects of individuals. Based on (1) a study carried out by Hariprasad V R et al.. (2013) regarding designing a validated Yoga intervention protocol for the elderly, (2) a selection from the classics of Yoga, and (3) the publications about geriatric care by the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, two protocols - one for a shorter duration of time (30 minutes) and another for a longer duration of time (45 minutes) -have been incorporated in the forthcoming pages along with a few general guidelines to be followed before, during, and after the Yoga practices. General guidelines for Yoga practices A Yoga practitioner should follow the general guidelines while performing Yogic practices. 1) Before the practice a. Cleanliness is an important requirement for Yogic practice. It incorporates the cleanliness of the body, purity of the mind, and serenity of the surrounding. b.

YOGA PROTOCOL FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION 10YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India40 f. The practices must be performed according to individual capacity. g. Exaggerations or the use of force must be consciously avoided. h. It is essential to do practices persistently and regularly as good results are achieved only after sometime. i. The instructions of the Yoga instructor/expert must be heard and understood properly before going into the practice. j. There are contra-indications/limitations for each Yogic practice, which should always be understood and kept in mind. k. A Yoga practice session must end with a meditative practice/deep silence/ Sankalpa /Shanti Patha . 3) After the practice a. Bath may be taken only after 20-30 minutes of practice. b. Food may be consumed only after 20-30 minutes of practice. Precautions for Yoga practices: Yoga practices should not bring undue pressure on the muscles and the heart. Vigorous and jerky movements should be avoided to reduce the danger of injuries. In Yoga practices, abrupt stretching of muscles, excessive twisting and holding of breath should be avoided. Breathing out consciously is more important. Regular Yoga practice is better than intermittent practice. The diet, bowel movements, sleep, rest and recreation should be regulated. Emphasize proper relaxation and practice of controlled respiration. Include leafy vegetables, raw vegetables and fruits to provide roughage in the diet. Pay more attention to spiritual activities and keep yourself busy with some favorite activity.YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India41 The Yoga Protocol for GERIATRIC Population (30minutes) S.

Brief details about the available studies are presented below. 1. V.R. Hariprasadet al.. (2013) conducted a study on the Effects of yoga intervention on sleep and quality-of-life in the elderly: A randomized controlled trial and concluded that Yoga interventions seem to improve the quality of life and quality of sleep of elderly people living in old-age homes. 2. David Haber (1983) carried out a research work titled, Yoga as A Preventive Health Care Program for White and Black Elders: An Exploratory Study. This work has revealed that the regular practice of Yoga would improve psychological well-being and also show a lowering effect on the systolic blood pressure level. On the other hand, doing Yoga practices only once a week may not yield the desired results. 3. Pranay Kumar Gupta et al.. (2010) conducted a research study on Anuloma-Viloma Pranayama and Anxiety and Depression among the Aged, which revealed that regular practice of Anuloma-Viloma Pranayama for three months, was able to decrease the level of anxiety and depression in senior citizens. 4. Allen KS et al.. (1987) carried out a study titled Yoga in a Geriatric Mental Clinic: Activities, Adaptation & Aging. Elderly people living in an independent retirement community were subjected to a weekly 60 minutes beginner Iyengar Yoga practices. The practices were tailored to individual functional levels using probes, which included stretching, flexibility, endurance, balance, and relaxation practices. Pre- and post-interventions at baseline, 12 weeks, and 1 year duration revealed that Yoga improved gait and balance, decreased pain, decreased the need for medications, decreased stress, improved sleep, less anxiety and depression, increased mobility, increased self-awareness, and greater sense of peace. No adverse events were reported. However, care-giving obligations, relocation, and perceived interference with religious beliefs hindered subjects' ability to fully participate. Older adults' perceived Yoga benefits extended to mental, psycho-social, and spiritual health. Caregiving obligations and religious belief conflicts deserve further exploration in future Yoga interventions for recruitment and retention of participants. 5. A research carried out by Harinath K, et al.. (2010) on Effects of Hatha yoga and Omkar meditation on cardio-respiratory performance, psychologic profile, and melatonin secretion concluded that Yoga practices for 3 months resulted in an improvement in cardio-respiratory performance and psychological profile. The plasma melatonin levels also showed an increase, suggesting that psycho- physiological stimuli to increase the endogenous secretion of melatonin, which, in turn, might be responsible for improved sense of well-being. 6. Loren M fishman et al.. (2009) carried out a work on Yoga for osteoporosis: A Pilot study, which included a small number of elderly people about the age of 68 years. Although suffering from osteoporosis or osteopenia, they were able to complete the total trial period of two years. During this period, they were subjected to 10 yoga postures with less holding followed by ample rest on a regular basis. The findings suggest that Yoga appears to have built bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis or osteopenia.viEVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH ON GERIATRIC POPULATION 11YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India44 7. Prachi Deshbhratar et al.. (2016) carried out a work titled To compare the effect of Pranayama and Breathing exercise on expiratory capacity in the geriatric population. In this study, 60 elderly people between the age of 55-75 years were divided in two groups of Pranayama (Anuloma-Viloma and Bhramari ) and conventional breathing exercises for 12 weeks. The result showed that the group that practiced Pranayama increased the expiratory capacity. 8. Indla Devasena et al.. (2011) conducted a study on Effect of Yoga on heart rate and blood pressure and its clinical significance where Yoga therapy was given for six months on healthy people above 40 years of age. Pre- and post-assessment suggested that the systolic blood pressure lowered to highly significant level, the diastolic blood pressure was reduced significantly, whereas the heart rate also decreased significantly, proving that Yoga intervention may provide significant improvement in ageing population in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. 9. A review article by Kannan K et al.. (2015) on Effectiveness of Pranayama on depression in elderly includes the findings of the studies based on the research papers published on Pranayama and its effects on depression between the years 2000 and 2013. The article concluded that the statistics supported the effectiveness of Pranayama on treating depression of elderly people effectively. It further suggested that this information can provide guidelines to clinicians and health-care providers for inclusion of the practice of Pranayama in treating older people with symptoms of depression. 10. A research work carried out by David S Black et al.. (2015) titled Mindfulness meditation and improvement in sleep quality and daytime impairment among older adults with sleep disturbances involved randomized clinical trial in two parallel groups. One group went through with mindful awareness practices and the other with sleep hygiene education as interventions. Both these groups received interventions for six weeks (2 hours per week) with assigned homework. The results revealed that the participants in the mindfulness awareness practices showed significant improvements compared to those in the sleep hygiene education group. This benefit was recorded on sleep disturbances and on the secondary health outcomes of insomnia symptoms, depression symptoms, fatigue interference and fatigue severity. 11. Lether land Leader et al.. (2013) in Mindfulness and dementia: A report of pilot study -carried out on people in the early stage of dementia- suggest that mindfulness meditation would improve the quality of life across a wide range of domains. These include reduction in anxiety, pain control, coping with the condition of dementia, regulations of emotions, improved sense of self, improved cognitive functioning, improved awareness and sense of appreciations, and improved interpersonal relationships. 12. MK Taneja (2016) carried out a study on Pranayama in presbyacusis and dementia, on15 middle-aged and senior citizens who did not benefit from wearing the hearing aid. After practising Bhramari Pranayama (Shanmukhi Mudra) for 3 months, 11 patients had an improvement of average 9 dB, 2 patients did not show any improvement. Out of the three known diabetic patients the blood sugar level of one patient came down to near normal limits, 5 patients having a history of forgetfulness bettered subjectively. This pilot study showed that there was an improvement in hearing in 11 (84.6%) patients and quality of life improved in 12 (92.3%) patients. Improvement was also found in diabetes or prostate symptoms. 13. Amin H et al.. (2014) in their paper on Memory loss in geriatric age and its prevention through yogic lifestyle suggest that the eight limbs Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dhyana, Dharana, of the overall health of ageing populations. It further prevents the accumulation of stress metabolites and keeps the physiology supple.YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India45 14. Dhar HL (1997) in work titled Health and aging concludes that regular meditation is the key to health (physical, mental, and social well-being). It elevates the mind from a grosser to a subtler level and makes the body and mind follow nature's law of living. Meditation helps achieve good health, prevent diseases, improve performance, and control the ageing process. A balanced diet (less sugar, salt, and fat with advancing age, with proper supplementation of micronutrients) along with mild to moderate exercise (walking, etc.,) add to the effect of meditation.xiv 15. VR Hariprasad, et al.. (2013) carried out an open-label exploratory pilot study testing the feasibility of the validated Yoga-based interventions on nine consenting elderly subjects having mild cognitive impairment. They were taught Yoga-based interventions for 1 month, where they were encouraged to participate daily with a minimum attendance of 12 sessions in one month. The post-intervention evaluation suggested that six (75%) subjects increased their physical ability, improved their memory condition, and were able to coordinate breathing with Yogasana ; five (62%) subjects were able to perform breathing as instructed in Pranayama section of the Yoga module. All subjects reported one or more benefits, which according to them were due to Yoga practices. They also experienced an improvement in concentration, elevated mood, and improvement in backache. No adverse event was reported. 16. Chen KM, et al.. (2008) carried out a research work, titled Sleep quality, depression state, and health status of older adults after silver Yoga exercises: cluster randomized trial , to evaluate the effect of 6 months of silver Yoga exercises. The Yoga intervention was aimed at promoting the mental health of elderly people in senior activity centres, focusing on their sleep quality, depression, and self-perception of health status. The participants were randomly bifurcated into two groups -experimental group and control group -based on their attendance at the selected senior activity centre. The subjects in the experimental group were allocated 70-min silver Yoga exercise program 3 times a week for 6 months. It was observed that after 3 months of intervention, many mental health indicators improved in the experimental group, which was maintained throughout the total duration of the study. After the completion of 6 months, sleep quality, depression, and health status improved in older adults. The results found in the experimental group were better than the control group. 17. Donesky-Cuenco D, et al.. (2009) published the results of their research work titled Yoga therapy decreases dyspnoea-related distress and improves functional performance in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study. The main purpose of undertaking this study was to evaluate a Yoga program for its safety, feasibility, and efficacy for decreasing the dyspnoea intensity and dyspnoea-related distress in elderly people with COPD. Clinically stable 29 patients (female -21) of average age 69.9 +/- 9.5 and having FEV1 47.7 +/- 15.6% were randomised to a 12-week Yoga program specifically designed for people with COPD or usual care control. Carried out twice a week, the Yoga program included Asanas (Yoga postures) and Vishama Vritti Pranayama (timed breathing). Safety measure outcomes included heart rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnoea, and pain. Feasibility was measured by patient-reported enjoyment, difficulty, and adherence to Yoga sessions. At baseline and at 12 weeks, dyspnoea intensity (DI) and dyspnea-related distress (DD) were measured during incremental cycle ergometry and a 6-minute walk (6MW) test. Secondary efficacy outcomes included physical performance, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). After the program, the subjects tolerated more activity with less dyspnoea-related distress (DD) and improved their functional performance. 18. A research work titled The effect of Yoga on mood in psychiatric inpatients was carried out by Lavey R, et al.. (2005) on 13 psychiatric inpatients to assess the effect of Yoga interventions on registered subjects with the profile of mood states (POMS). The results revealed that Yoga interventions provided YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India46 significant improvement on all negative factors of emotion that contributed to POMS- tension, anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue and confusion. The study reiterated the positive role of Yoga on mood improvement and stress reduction in the treatment of psychiatric inpatients. 19. A randomised control trial by NK Manjunath (2005/06) -Yoga and Geriatric Care: an Evaluation of Positive Health Indicators - reported improvement in various psycho-physiological parameters in geriatric population after 6 months of an integrated Yoga programme comprising Asanas (physical postures), Pranayama (breathing techniques), guided relaxation, and devotional sessions for 60 minutes a day/6 days a week. The improvement was observed in semantic, primary and working short-term memory and episodic memory. It was also noticed that depression scores and self-rated quality of sleep improved after the study period. These changes may be attributed to the possible reduction in anxiety and distractibility as well as increased secretion of 'feel good' hormones such as endorphins and reduced secretion of stress hormones. The control group showed deterioration in different aspects of functioning.xix 20. Karel Nespor, a Czech psychiatrist, (1993) in his article Twelve years of experience with Yoga in psychiatry\", had identified lack of suitable physical activity and stimulation as the commonest problem. According to him, gentle joint exercises and relaxations are found to be beneficial and well- accepted by the patients. Regardless of the religion, Yoga enhances one's spiritual life and perspective beyond the physical life. A detailed outline of the potential benefits of Yoga in alcohol and drug abuse has been provided in this article. Stress, anxiety, and depression are relieved by Yogic techniques like relaxation and meditative practices. People practicing Yoga are usually not inclined to drug or alcohol abuse, which provides a safer social network. The feeling of helplessness, which is normally found in the patients of such abuses, is counteracted by increased self-awareness and improved self-control of one's physical and psychological nature. Yoga provides a safer non-pharmacological management of psychosomatic problems like insomnia, headache, and general body pain, thus reducing the use of addictive analgesics. Yoga aids people to come out of such abuses by helping them to overcome the stress of early abstinence after withdrawal symptoms. 21. A study by Shapiro D, et al.. in 2007 - Yoga as a Complementary Treatment of Depression: Effects of Traits and Moods on Treatment Outcome-revealed that Yoga produces benevolent effects on emotional, psychological, and biological spheres, which can be observed by significant reductions in depression, anger, anxiety, neurotic symptoms and low-frequency heart rate variability with improvement in mood. Further, Yoga is a promising intervention due to its cost-effectiveness and easy implementation for depressives and other patients. 11 out of 17 patients (64.7%) subjected in this work achieved remission levels of their problems post-intervention. Participants who remitted differed from the non-remitters at intake on several traits and on physiological measures, indicative of a greater capacity for emotional regulation.xxi 22. Sharma VK, et al..(2006), in their study titled Effect of Sahaj Yoga on neurocognitive functions in patients suffering from major depression have talked about the effectiveness of Yoga in managing depression. Sahaj Yoga, in addition to improvement in various other cognitive domains seen with conventional anti-depressants, led to additional improvement in executive functions such as manipulation of information in verbal working memory and added improvement in attention span and visuo-motor speed of depressives. 23. The study by Krishnamurthy MN and Telles S (2007) evaluated the effects of two ancient interventions, namely, Yoga and Ayurveda, on 69 subjects older than 60 years of age living in a residential home. All the subjects were suffering from geriatric depression. For the study - titled Assessing depression following two ancient Indian interventions: Effects of Yoga and Ayurveda on older adults in a residential YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India47 home-the subjects were randomly segregated into three groups -Yoga, Ayurveda, and wait list control - after stratifying them by age and gender. Three assessments using the 15-item geriatric depression scale were used prior to the intervention at the end of 3 months and after 6 months post intervention. The Yoga program, which lasted for 7 hours and 30 minutes per week for 24 weeks, had included physical postures, relaxation techniques, regulated breathing, devotional songs and lectures. The Ayurveda group received a herbal preparation twice daily for the total duration. After the 3 and 6 months periods, the Yoga group showed a significant decrease in the depression symptoms score - from the average baseline of 10.6 to 8.1 and 6.7, respectively (p<0.001, paired t-test). There was no change in other groups. The study concluded that an integrated approach to Yoga (with the inclusion of mental and philosophical aspects, and physical practices) was useful for institutionalized elderly people. xxiii 24. The study by Beena Ranu K (2013) entitled Yogic practice and diabetes mellitus in geriatric patients concluded that Yoga improves the risk profile induced by stress in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as preventing and delaying its complication. In this study, 73 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the age group of 60-70 years with a chronicity of 5-10 years and poor glycemic control (HbA1c >8%) were enrolled and divided into three groups according to their glycemic control- Group A with Hb1c 8.6-9.7%, group B with 9.7-10.7 %, and group C with Hb1c 10.8- 12.7%. In all the groups, patients were advised Yoga practice for 90 minutes daily for three months under supervision. Biochemical assessment of HbA1c, blood glucose, lipid profile, cortisol, ferritin, malondialdehyde, and catalyse activity were carried out initially and after 90 days found improvement at a statistically significant level. 25. A study by Furtado G E, et al..(2016) titled Effects of a Chair-Yoga exercises on stress hormone levels, daily life activities, falls and physical fitness in institutionalized older adults was conducted in 35 female participants (20 study group + 15 control group). Chair Yoga was practiced for twice a week for 14 weeks. The study results showed improvement in physical fitness and reduction in stress hormones, mainly cortisol and - amylase, in the study group when compared to the control group.xxv 26. The study by Nick Narjes, et al..(2016) titled The effect of Yoga on balance and fear of falling in older adults RCT [Study group (Yoga Intervention) and Control group (No Yoga intervention)] was conducted to determine the effect of falling on older adults. 40 subjects in the age group 60-74 years were recruited for the study. Pre- and post-Yoga therapy Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES) score and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score data were recorded. After the 8-week Yoga program, the analysed pre- and post-data showed significant changes in both the variables - MFES and BBS-as compared to the Control group. The result suggests that Yoga may be used to reduce the fear of falling and improve balance in older adults. xxvi 27. A systematic review and meta analysis have been done by Cramer, Holger, et al..(2014) in their study titled Effects of Yoga on cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In this work, 44 RCTs with a total of 3168 samples were included; the samples were predefined cardio- vascular or non-diabetic with a high risk of cardio-vascular diseases or participants with diabetes mellitus type 2. The pre- and post-therapy analysis of the participants showed a significant difference as compared to the control group. Yoga intervention improved anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, and cardio-vascular parameters like blood pressure and heart rate. This meta-analysis reveals evidence that Yoga can be beneficial in cardiovascular risk factors. 28. Mittal, Karuna, et al.. (2016) studied the Effect of mind body therapy (Yoga, meditation & music) on elderly hypertensive people. 100 elderly hypertensive patients (ages of> 60 years) were recruited for the study and divided into two groups randomly. Baseline data of body mass index (BMI), waist-YOGA FOR GERIATRIC POPULATION Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India48 to-hip ratio, fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, lipid profile (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C) were recorded. Blood pressure data were recorded weekly in a regular manner. After MBT therapy for three months continuously (minimum five times a week), the post-therapy data were recorded and analysed. Results showed significant change when comparing in between the 2 groups (p<0.01). A highly significant difference was observed in blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, changes in lipid profile like HDL, LDL, and VLDL. It indicates Yoga can be used as adjunctive therapy in the management of hypertension. References 1. V. R. Hariprasad, P . T. Sivakumar, V. Koparde, S. Varambally, J. M. Varghese, I. V.

Then exhale slowly through the left nostril by closing the right nostril with the right thumb. Instead of exhaling through the left nostril, one can slowly exhale through both the nostrils.
