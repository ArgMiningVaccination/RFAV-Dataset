This is the first attempt to produce a consolidated document covering medical conditions includ ed in the task agreement between the National Highway Traffic Sa fety Administration (NHTSA1) and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA2). Many medical conditions are not covered by this document. They have been excluded in order to limit the project to manageable objectives and to focus on the most common conditions. Additional conditions will be addressed in subsequent proj ects. Evaluations of driver fitness should not be limited to only those medical conditions that are addressed in this guide. A broad- spectrum approach is best when addressing driv er fitness. Individual evaluations should assess vision, physical impairments, and medical conditions such as diabetes, dementia, sleep apnea, and seizures. Temporary medical conditions should also be assessed. These guidelines are voluntary. They ar e provided to assist motor vehicle administrations in making the difficult decisions that weigh an individual's driving privilege against the demands of public safet y. Establishing medical guidelines that are applicable for all jurisdictions has been ch allenging. This guid e was not created to determine the methods by which jurisdictions should make these decisions. Whether to use medical advisory boards, administrative re view, or a combination of these should be determined within each jurisdiction. Although these guidelines are based upon a scientific literature review and provide ge neral recommendations, decisions concerning a driver's ability should be made on a case-by-case basis. It is understood that drivers should be allowed to continue to drive as long as possible provided there is a reasonable expectation that they can safely operate a vehicle. Only when an individual poses an imminent thr eat to public safety should their driving privilege be withdrawn or rest ricted. The driving privileg e may be restored when the individual's condition becomes stable or returns to a state where their mental and physical capability allows them to operate a vehicle safely. An individual's having a disease is not sufficient cause for a jurisdic tion to withdraw the dr iving privilege. The disease must affect that person visually, physically, or cognitively in a manner that jeopardizes public safety. These medical gu idelines are based upon research and a best practices approach toward dete rmining whether an individual is capable of driving safely. However, when making decisions about an indi vidual's fitness for driving, it is important that licensing agencies comply with th e Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a Federal civil rights law that pr ovides comprehensive protection for disabled individuals. Federal ADA regulations explicitly forbid dr iver licensing agencies from administering their programs in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. Ex cept with respect to a limited number of functional deficits about which there is c onsensus in the medical and highway safety communities (for example, the need for an applicant to be seizure-free for a period of time prior to licensing), States may not use inflexible medical standards to exclude disabled applicants from th eir licensing programs. Rather , the ADA requires that States Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines iii individually assess an appli cant's fitness to drive, as through the review of m edical documentation or the performance of written or on-road driving examinations. The guidelines in this document should help licensing authorities to make appropriate licensing decisions that are compliant w ith these civil rights requirements. The AAMVA Driver Fitness Working Group (DFWG 3) was composed of jurisdictional representatives. The DFWG served as the sounding board and provided important direction for the development of these guidelines for making licensing decisions on medically at-risk drivers. Part icipants of the DFWG included: Kim Snook, Iowa Motor Vehicle Division, Chair; Mike Alderman, Florida Divi sion of Driver Licenses; Michael Bailey, Oklahoma Depa rtment of Public Safety; California Depa Motor Vehicles; Cydney DeModica, Arizona Motor Vehicle Jamie Dow M.D., de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec ; Cheryl Forehand, R.N., Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration; Jack Joyce, J.D., Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration; Jennifer Kroeker-Hall, Driver Licensi ng Policy Insurance Corporation of British Columbia; Jean G. LeBlanc, New Brunswick Department of Transport; Diana McIntosh-Dilworth, Indian a Bureau of Motor Vehicles; William Merrill, Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicle Services; Jill Reeve, Wisconsin Bureau of Driver Services; Selma Sauls, Florida Division of Driver Licenses; Susan Stewart, North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles; Carl Soderstrom M.D., Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration; sity of Iowa; and Wendy Stav, Ph.D., Towson University. This document is the result of a great deal of research. The DFWG's mission was to establish guidelines that jurisdictions can use to apply a scient ific, evidence-based approach to their licensing decisions. Thr oughout the development of this document, the DFWG sought input from stakeholders through mee tings and open lines of communication. The DFWG considered each recommendation and issue raised by individuals within th e stakeholder community in devel oping these guidelines. Every effort was made to accommodate those r ecommendations. Recommend ations that could not be supported by outside evidence were not included. There are, however, several cases where there is a legitimate diffe rence in opinion between the DFWG and stakeholders in how the outside evidence c ould be interpreted in the formulation of guidance to the driver licensing adm inistrato r. By recognizing these differences in opinion, our intent is to provi de decision-makers with a better understanding of and respect for potentially-dissenting points of view. The guidelines are designed to provide Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines iv Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines v evidence-based support to the driver licensing community in order to enhance highway safety and protect public health. All stakeholders should conti nue an active involvement in bringing new evidence to the attention of AAMVA, NHTSA, a nd the licensing community to enhance revisions of this document. This document will be updated as research and data becomes available from the medical and motor vehicle communities. To submit comments to AAMVA, please forward comments to: AAMVA Program Director, Prog rams Division 4301 Wilson, Blvd., Suite 400 Arlington, VA 22203 Questions or comments regarding NHTSA's involvement in the development of this guide should be forwarded to: NHTSA Chief, Safety Countermeasures Division 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE. Washington, DC 20590 How to Use the Guide In the guide, there are ratings of the quality of the evidence: high, moderate, and low. These ratings represent the repl icability of the research pres ented in each study. A \"low\" rating for a study does not mean that the rese arch was poorly conducted; it suggests that there are limits to its applica tion in real-world settings. A group of studies with low ratings is more meaningful than a single, si milarly-rated, study. Much of the research that was uncovered in the development of these guidelines falls into the low to moderate replicability. The volume of re search in any particular area, combined with the quality of evidence, contributes to the strength of the guidance that is offered to the driver licensing authority. Chapter 1 contains key guidance for driver licensing authorities, medical providers, and drivers. Because the primary audience for this guide is driver licensing authorities, the guidance for the other audiences should be used to educate these important referral sources on how to keep drivers safe. Chapters 2 through 5 contain background in formation, detailed recommendations, and guidance for a range of the most commonly reviewed medical conditions that drivers present to licensing authorities. Guidan ce is provided, based on the quality of the evidence, in one of the three following categories: 1. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. 2. Evidence is not so clear-cut but is sugges tive and allows for a guidance statement. 3. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or nonexistent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Appendix B contains a sample medical examination form that aims to help the driver licensing authority to collect useful and complete information so it may make an informed decision regarding the licesensure of an individual driver. This form reflects the guidance on soliciting information that is included in the body of the guide. When reading this guide you will see numbers just above important or frequently used key words. These numbers correspond to the definition or acronym of the word that can be found in the glossary on page 136. Some nu mbers appear more than once, since some words appear in several chapters. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines vi Chapter 1: Recommendations for DMVs, Clinicians, and Drivers Introduction Balancing public safety and i ndividual driving privileges has been a difficult challenge for driver licensing agencies. The need to establish policies for conducting initial medical assessments, evaluating drivers, and de ciding what, if any, re strictions should be imposed on their driving privilege has le ft licensing agencies looking for reliable guidlines. It must be emphasised that the Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs 4) are tasked with determining whether or not individuals are func tionally able to drive safely. The larger health aspects of these guidelines may be of interest to clinicians and researchers but are not an immediate concern for the DMV. For instance, DMVs determine whether a driver's visual acuity 5 meets a prescribed standard. Generally, questions of how an i ndividual's visual acuity is corrected, i.e., spectacles versus contact lenses, are not within the DMV's purview. It is up to drivers to ensure that they meet the visual acuity standard s. If a driver's curre nt prescription is not appropriate, it is not up to the DMV to ensu re that it is change d. Drivers who are suspended can take steps to correct their visu al acuity and request a retest. The DMV can then determine whether the individual's corre cted vision meets the standard. If it does the license will be renewed. If not , the suspension will be reconfirmed. It should also be noted that DMVs rely on me dical forms to gather vision information on drivers, particularly with the growing popular ity of remote permit renewals where drivers are not required to be physically present. Medical Guidelines for DMVs These recommended guidelines can be supported by scientific evidence: Vision : 1. The DMV should test visual acuity at pe rmit renewal for all driv ers age 65 or older. 2. The DMV should test visual acuity w ith both eyes open and examined together. 3. When a driver is identified who does not meet the visual acuity 5 standard for licensure, it is appropriat e for the DMV to suggest that the driver seek a comprehensive eye examination. 4. States that permit drivers with relatively low vision to driv e should evaluate the safety (i.e., crash involvement) of these drivers ove r time and compare th em to drivers who do pass the visual acuity scr eening test that the jurisdiction administers. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 1 5. The DMV should give drivers with visual field6 defects that re nder them unfit according to the standards on visual fields the opportunity to demonstrate that they can drive safely despite their disability. 6. The DMV should test visual fields w ith both eyes open and examined together. 7. With regard to color vision the DMV s hould require that drivers be able to discriminate between the different traffic lights. 8. Since slowed visual processing speed has b een repeatedly shown to be associated with driver safety and performance pr oblems, jurisdictions should consider implementing a screening test for licensure and re-licensure that assesses processing speed. Physical Limitations: 1. The DMV should define a physical limitati on as the incapacity to perform any of the physical operations required to operate a st andard (unmodified) motor vehicle of the class of vehicle that the driver wishes to operate. 2. The DMV should individually assess driver s with physical limitations regarding their ability to drive. 3. The DMV should conduct an assessment to evaluate an individual's ability to drive each class of vehicle included in the proposed permit. DMVs 4 may require adaptations or modifications to the vehicle and/or restrict driving to vehicles with automatic transmissions. 4. The DMV should clearly state that a driver's inability to safely ope rate a vehicle that has been modified to accommodate a driver's physical limitations is incompatible with driving and the license should be suspended. 5. In the case of degenerative disorders that affect physical function, such as Parkinson's Disease and multiple sclerosis, the DMV s hould evaluate the drivers, at a minimum using behind the wheel testing, on a periodic basis to ensure that they are capable of continued safe driving. Dementia: 1. The DMV should note that severe dementia7 is incompatible with safe driving. 2. The DMV should recognize that mild and moderate dementia may be compatible with safe driving. Individual functional assessment of driving skills is necessary to determine fitness to drive. Reassessment is required at 6- to 12- month intervals based on the evolution of the dementia. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 2 3. There is insufficient evidence to recomm end driver licensing countermeasures such as restricted driver licenses in drivers with dementia. There is concern among some experts that issueing restricted licenses to individuals with dementia may falsely give the impression that they are deemed safe to drive, when in fact they are deemed not safe without the restrictions. 4. \"Co-piloting,\" or having another individual guide a driver with dementia through the driving task, is not a safe dr iving practice. DMVs should not issue restricted licenses that are contingent on a driver with de mentia having a passenger to help them. 5. Indicators that DMVs can consider using to require a cognitive assessment by a health care professional include at least two * of the following: (1) Age 80 years or older; (2) History of a recent crash or moving violation; (3) Applicant self-report or caregiv er report of impaired skills; (4) Use of psychoactive medications 8 such as benzodiazepines9, neuroleptics10, antidepressants11, or use of medications for Alzheimer's disease12 (AD13); (5) History of activ e alcohol abuse; (6) History of falls; (7) Inability to understand or hear instructions during interactions with the DMV 4 examiner or the health professional; (8) Scores with simple screening tools that indicate the possibility of a cognitive deficit; and (9) Inability to complete the DMV knowledge test. Applicants with greater number s of risk factors should be considered at greater risk, although the relative risks are not necessarily additive. Diabetes : 1. The DMV should note that recurrent hypoglycemic14 episodes requiring third-party assistance are incompatible with safe driving unless certification by the treating clinician demonstrates that the driver has been stable for three months. 2. The DMV should establish policies that following a hypoglycemic episode requiring third-party assistance, a driv er should not resume driving unless the treating clinician has certified that the diabetes 15 is under control. * Whle the above recommendations came from the Driver Fitness Working Group, not all experts agree. Both the Alzheimer's Association and AARP disagreed with the presence of only two risk factors as justification for further assessment at the request of the DMV. For a better understanding of their reasons for non-concurrence, readers should contact those organizations. While the above recommendations cam e from the Driver Fitness Working Group, not all experts agree. Alternative viewpoints are presented in Appendix C. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 3 3. The DMV should note that hypoglycem ic unawareness is incompatible with safe driving. 4. The DMV should require periodic medical controls from drivers with diabetes who experience hypoglycemic episodes requiring th e intervention of a third party. The frequency of these reports should be determined by the DMV. Seizures: 1. A diagnosis or history of seizures s hould preclude unconditional certification by the DMV to drive. 2. The DMV should note that a driver who suffers a convulsive seizure caused by abuse of alcohol or drugs is unfit to drive until the driver can demonstrate a period of at least 6 months of abstinence. 3. The DMV should require periodic medical controls of drivers with epilepsy 16 at a frequency to be determined by the DMV4. 4. The DMV should note that a driver who suffers a convulsive seizure 17 is considered unfit to drive for a period of at least 6 months following the incident. Resumption of driving should require a positive recommendation by the treating clinician. 5. A drivers with epilepsy who no longer require AEDs 31 and has not had a seizure for at least 2 years should no longer requir e annual medical recertification. Sleep Disorders: 1. The DMV should note that a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea18 (OSA19) is incompatible with safe driving if the driv er manifests daytime drowsiness or has an apnea hypopnea index20 (AHI)21 of 20 or more unless treatment is demonstrated to have eliminated the daytime drowsiness or to have lowered the AHI to 19 or less. The DMV should establish policies such that maintenance of driving privileges is conditional upon the maintenance of the succe ssful therapy and s ubject to periodic medical controls at a frequency to be established by the DMV. 2. The DMV should note that narcolepsy22 is incompatible with safe driving unless successfully treated by a clinician or health care provider. Medical Guidelines for Clinicians and Other Health Care Providers Many of the recommendations by the research ers concern matters that are not in the purview of the DMV but are important considerations for the clinicia ns and other health care professionals who must evaluate driver medical fitness. The DMV should educate these professionals about th e effects of functional impairments on safe driving, particularly in the context of medical controls. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 4 In evalu ating a driver's medical fitness, the health professional must consider a number of factors. Any medical condition that affect s physical or mental functioning may affect driving fitness. When the physical or mental effects of the condition are progressive in nature, periodic evaluations are required. The presence of multiple medical conditions means that the cumulative effects of all the medical conditions must be evaluated. Medical conditions that affect driving fall into three categories: 1. Conditions that engender functional limitations (chronic compromise); 2. Conditions that involve an associated risk of compromise of consciousness (acute compromise); and 3. Use of substances (alcohol, drugs, me dications) judged to be incompatible with safe driving. This classification is useful when dealing wi th questions of driver fitness. All the medical conditions that may affect driver fitn ess will fall into one of these categories. Unfortunately, it is impossible to draw up a co mprehensive list of c onditions that health professionals must consider in their evaluati on of medical driving fitness. Any disease process that over time will affect sensory, motor, or cognitive ability can influence driving ability. Driving cessation is an unfortunate fact of life. Everybody will ceas e driving one day if they live long enough. Men can expect to cease driving about 6 years before their death and for women the figure is about 11 years. Consequently, health professionals can expect to be confronted by mobility problems fo r their clientele as thei r patients age. The maintenance of mobility and the problems caused by the loss of driving privileges will become a major concern for most health-care providers in the near future. However, mobility concerns must take second place to road safety considerations when driver fitness is compromised. Health professionals must always bear in mind that they do not withdraw or suspend driving privileges; only the DMV has the auth ority to do so. The health professional's role is to provide the DMV with the inform ation it requires in order to make the appropriate decision about the driv er's ability to drive safely in the light of the driver's state of health. Consequently, it is acceptabl e for health professionals to inform the DMV that they are unable to form a definite opini on about the driver's medical fitness to drive based upon their office evaluation since ma ny instances will require a road test. Some conditions or their treatment may have temporary effects on driving fitness. Temporary unfitness to drive is the purview of the treating clinician when the period of unfitness will be of short duration. The routin e advice given to the patient in the normal course of managing the condition should al ways include driving considerations. However, if the patient indicates the inten tion to disregard this advice, the health professional should document the advice and the pa tent's stated intentions in the patient's file and inform the DMV of the potentially dangerous situation. The following sections present a discussi on of the considerations a health care professional should review when evaluating a driver's medical fitness to drive. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 5 Vision: 1. Health care professionals should recognize that drivers of private automobiles and motorcycles require a visual acuity 5 and field of vision test according to the statutory requirements within their jurisdiction with both eyes open and examined together. Any visual condition that lead s to a lowering of either co rrected visual acuity or visual field6 to levels inferior to the standard renders the driver unfit for driving without restrictions issued by the DMV. 2. Health care professionals should be aware that, should this occu r, the driver who wishes to continue driving will be requi red to undergo a functional evaluation in order to determine if they are able to drive safely despite their failure to meet the standards. In order to succeed in th e functional evaluation, the driver must demonstrate that their condition is stable and that they are able to compensate for the resulting disability. In the event that th e driver's condition is unstable, or still evolving, the health professiona l should encourage the driver to wait for the condition to stabilize. 3. Health care professionals should be aware that changes in visual acuity or visual fields following stroke 23 or traumatic head injury24 are often accompanied by changes in cognitive status. Consequen tly, the investigation of visual changes related to such events should always include evaluations of the speed of visual processing. 4. Health care professionals should be aware that although it is agr eed that contrast sensitivity25 is an important factor in the visu al evaluation of a patient, the current state of the art does not permit its incorpor ation into the driver evaluation process. 5. Health care professionals should be aware th at after the sudden loss of one eye, the patient will require a period of adapta tion to monocular vision before resuming driving. The length of the period required can vary greatly from one individual to another and clinicians should advise their patients in this situ ation to cease driving until their evaluations conf irm successful adaptation. Physical Limitations: 1. Health care professionals should be aware th at any condition that affects the upper or lower limbs, the neck, and the back may ha ve an effect on the patient's fitness to drive. It is extremely rare that the driver's vehicle cannot be modified to accommodate a physical limitation. However, unless the appropriate evaluation of the driver's needs is perfor med, the driver may persist in driving a vehicle without modifications, thereby creating a situation that is potential ly dangerous. The health care professional should make referrals to driving professionals for assessment and rehabilitation related to driving. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 6 2. Health care professionals should be aware th at in situations where there is an acute injury (fractures, dislocations) or a post -surgical situation, th e functional lim itations may be temporary. As long as the immob ilization is in place or the affected articulation has not achieved full mobility the driver should be advi sed to refrain from driving. For example, attempting to drive us ing the unaffected left leg to operate the pedals, using a cane or other device to opera te the pedals, or having a co-driver work the stick-shift are not safe alternatives to temporary driver cessa tion in this situation. 3. Health care professionals should be aware th at the removal of an immobilization after several weeks of immobilization does not impl y immediate fitness to resume driving. After a 3- to-4 week immobilization, an ankle may take up to 9 weeks before the ankle achieves full function. While this does not mean that the resumption of driving requires an additional 9 weeks, it does m ean that resumption should only occur when the mobility of the articulation is adequa te for driving rather than immediately following cast removal. 4. Health care professionals should be awar e that immobilizations of the upper limbs, especially immobilizations of the wrist, ha nd, or fingers, may have an adverse effect upon the driver's ability to ma nipulate the controls and the steering wheel. Adaptive devices that are recommended by a driving professional could alleviate the person's vehicle control issues. 5. Health care professionals should be aw are that when the loss of function is permanent, the impact upon driving will depend upon the extent of the loss of function. Minimal limitations, su ch as partial loss of one or several fingers or toes, may not require modification of the driver's vehicle because they have no effect on the physical functions required for driving. 6. The health care professional must assess the extent of the physi cal and psychomotor limitations and determine if further func tional evaluation is indicated. Any doubts about the capacity of the driver to perform the tasks requi red for driving safely must be subjected to further assessment, usually by an occupational th erapist or a driving specialist. In-office evalua tion is rarely adequate. 7. Since every case must be evaluated on its individual merits, there are no generalized rules of the type \"If you have X, you cannot drive for 3 weeks.\" Each case must be assessed taking into consideration the i ndividual characteristics of the person involved. Dementia: 1. Health care professionals should be aware that suspicion of the possibility of a diagnosis of dementia7 should immediately trigger a functional evaluation of the driver's fitness to drive. So me experts suggest that any cognitive deficit, particularly a newly observed deficit, should also trigger a functional evaluation. 2. Health care professionals should be aware that although there is unanimous agreement that severe dementia is incomp atible with safe driving, precluding the requirement for a functional evaluation, the cognitive deficiencies in mild and Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 7 moderate dem entia are so varied that it is impossible to predict on-road driving performance on the basis of the results of th e various tests used to evaluate cognitive deficits. 3. Health care professionals should be awar e that self-awareness/insight and judgment are vital to safe driving but are difficult to measure in cognitive tests. Even when the off-road examiner can identif y problems with insight and ju dgment it is not easy to predict driver performance. Consequentl y, except in the most extreme cases, which should probably be classified as severe ra ther than mild or moderate dementia, the road test is an integral part of the functional evaluation of driving skills. 4. Health care professionals shoul d be aware that a number of tests have been identified as useful in predicting driver pe rformance. Trail Making A and B 26 and similar tests are useful in identifying drivers who ma y perform badly on road tests. Their predictive power is not sufficient for licen sing decisions to be based solely on the results of these and similar tests, but it is appropriate for identi fying individuals for further examination. 5. Health care professionals should be aw are that the Mini Mental Status Exam 27 (MMSE28) or Folstein test is a screening t ool useful in identifying people with a cognitive problem that requires further assessment. Although it has some predictive value as far as on-road performance is con cerned, it can not be used to exclude the person from holding a license. 6. Health care professionals should be awar e that a score of 24/30 or less on the MMSE 28 equates to a 70-percent chance of fa ilure on the road test and a score of 19/30 to a 95-percent failure rate. Howe ver, a score of 24 also equates to a 30- percent chance of success. No method has b een developed to identify which group an individual will fall into. Consequently, an MMSE score, by itself, is insufficient to justify a recommendati on of driving cessation. 7. Health care professionals should be awar e that even a score of 30/30 on the MMSE does not preclude the chance of failure on the road test. Since the MMSE does not evaluate insight or judgment, deficiencies in these areas are possible with such a result. 8. The health-care professional who suspects a cognitive problem, no matter what the MMSE result, should insist upon a functional assessment. The same is true when the MMSE result is abnormal. 9. Ideally health care professionals would de tect the potentially-compromised patient before there is a road-safety-related incide nt. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, partly because most health professiona ls have little knowledge of or awareness of the road safety implications of ma ny medical conditions, including mild dementia 7. However, the diagnosis of dementia can be difficult and the first sign of cognitive problems may be a crash. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 8 The practice of \"co-piloting,\" or having anothe r individual guide a dr iver with dem entia through the driving task, is not safe and s hould be strongly discouraged by health care professionals. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 9 Diabetes: 1. Health care professionals should be aware that drivers with diabetes15 as a group are at increased risk of having road crashes. Although it is agreed that the major risk involved is that associated with hypoglycemia14, it appears that the hypoglycemic phenomenon by itself does not explain all th e increased risk. Consequently, all drivers with diabetes should be counseled to the effect that they are at an increased risk and that even mild hypoglycemia shoul d be avoided when they are driving. Patients should be counseled on the importa nce of frequent stops and snacks, easy availability of glucose supplements a nd early recognition of signs of impending hypoglycemia. 2. Health care professionals should be aware that DMVs4 concentrate their efforts on those drivers who suffer hypoglycemic episodes that require the assistance of a third party. Professionals should counsel any driver who experi ences such an episode to not drive until the driver's treating clinician is certain that the risk of a recurrence has been minimized. In some instances this period without drivin g may last several months and some experts feel that a 3- month period for almost everyone in this situation would be appropriate. However, it is the clinical judgment of the treating clinician that is the important factor since the individual's particular situation will be the major factor. 3. Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes that requir e third-party interv ention are a counter- indication to driving. Resuming driving for such an individual will depend upon an informed opinion from the treating clinician. 4. Hypoglycemic unawareness, where the hypoglycemic episode occurs with no forewarning being perceived by the individual, is an absolute c ounter-indication to driving. As long as the unaw areness persists, the person mu st be counseled to refrain from driving. 5. Insulin 29-treated diabetes15 is not, in itself, a justification for disqualification from driving. However, the potential for a hypoglycemic14 episode is considered to be higher for the insulin-treated diabetic than for diabetics treated by oral medication. Consequently, health care professionals should provide patient education on the problems associated with drivi ng and insulin-treated diabetes. 6. All drivers with diabetes s hould see their treatin g clinician at least annually. Those who encounter difficulties with control should be seen more frequently in accordance with their treating clinicians' assessme nt of the requirements for follow-up and control. Any changes in status \u2014 for exam ple, the initiation of insulin treatment \u2014 should be communicated to the DMV, pr eferably by the drivers themselves. 7. Before recommending that their patient with diabetes continue driving, the treating clinician should ensure that there is a good understanding of the disease, that the patient is free of hypoglycemic episodes requi ring third-party intervention and that While the above recommendations cam e from the Driver Fitness Working Group, not all experts agree. Alternative viewpoints are presented in Appendix C. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 10 the patient is willing to follow the sugge sted treatment plan. The patient's compliance with the suggested therapy and the maintenance of blood sugar readings within an acceptable range are important in establishing that th e patient understands and is compliant in the management of the condition. The patient should demonstrate to the clinician that they are ab le to recognize in cipient hypoglycemia14 and can take the appropriate action when they become symptomatic. Seizures: 1. Health care professionals should be aware that anti-epileptic drugs30 (AEDs31) are known to produce side effects in some patients that may affect driving. Normally patients affected by AEDs will complain to their clinicians, who should then counsel them on restricting their driv ing until the side effects have passed. Such patients should have their levels of the drug monitored regularly and should be counseled to cease driving if toxic effects occur. 2. Following a unique seizure 17, the patient should be counsel ed to not drive while under investigation. Driving may be resumed if the neurological32 and cardiac investigations have not revealed a cause or if a treatable cause has been identified and the therapy successful. If the neurological investigation reveals that the patient has epilepsy16, the health care professional should co unsel the patient that they will be subjected to the local jurisdiction's medical standard for epileptic seizures. 3. Following a diagnosis of epilepsy, the driv er should undergo an annual examination by the treating clinician. The frequency of the controls by the treating clinician may be relaxed gradually in accordance with the treating clinician's clinical assessment of the situation. 4. Cessation of AEDs may lead to a new seiz ure. The driver who suffers a seizure following a prescribed cessation of AEDs should be counseled to not drive until therapeutic levels of AEDs are achieved that are comparable to the levels prior to the cessation of AEDs. A seizure following voluntary cessation of AEDs by the driver without medical supervision should be treated in the same manner as an unprovoked seizure. 5. Health care professionals s hould be aware that seizures 17 induced by the ingestion of alcohol or drugs must be followed by a 6- month period of abstinence before driving can be resumed. If substance abuse or dependence is present that meets the diagnostic criteria described in the Dia gnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders33 (DSM-IV34), driving is counter-indicated until the person meets the diagnostic criteria for prolonged remission. Jurisdictional requirements vary for alcohol treatment program attendance and other measures such as mandatory installation of ignition interlock devices. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 11 Sleep Disorders: 1. Drivers who have obstructive sleep apnea18 (OSA19) may be counseled by their health care professionals to continue to drive if there is no daytime drowsiness or if the AHI21 is less than 20. Drivers with daytime sleepiness or an AHI of 20 or more may drive only if the condition ha s been treated effectively or as long as the patients continue the therapy. Ceasing the th erapy should be accompanied by driving cessation if the OSA is still present. 2. Continuous positive airway pressure35 (CPAP36) therapy has been shown to be an efficient treatment for OSA. Health care professionals should be aware that CPAP therapy reaches optimal effectiveness after 2 weeks but the effects disappear rapidly upon cessation of its use. Even a single night of non-compliance has been shown to adversely affect surrogate markers of crash risk. 3. In the event of therapeutic non-co mpliance for a patient with OSA 19, no matter what the reason, the health care pr ofessional should counsel that driving be ceased immediately. 4. Some sleep disorders are amenable to pharm aceutical treatment. When the treatment has eliminated the daytime drowsiness or the sudden onset of sleep, the patient may be counseled to resume driving for as long as the therapy is effective. Recommendations for Drivers With At-Risk Conditions General: 1. Most jurisdictions have regulations that require drivers to self-report any change in their medical condition. Generally, failure to do so may be grounds for suspension and, in some jurisdictions, criminal procedures. 2. In most cases, the ADA requires that States individually assess an applicant's fitness to drive safely, as through the review of medical documentation or the performance of written or on-road driving examinations. U nder that statute and comparable State and local laws, the DMV must reasonably accomm odate the needs of individuals with disabilities who can demonstrate their ability to drive safely. Vision: 1. Generally, it is recommended th at drivers whose visual acuity5 just meets the standards should not drive at night. Darkness diminishes visual acuity so a person with a visual acuity that just meets the sta ndard will have an effective visual acuity in darkness that is lower than the standard. Some jurisdictions will impose a restriction on the driver's license to this effect for such a driver. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 12 2. Drivers who require correction of their visu al acu ity to meet the visual acuity standards for drivers must wear their co rrective devices (e.g., glasses or contact lenses) when driving. 3. DMVs will base their decision for licensure upon the corrected visual acuity that is demonstrated by the driver in the visual test. It is in the driver's interest to have optimal correction. A DMV may advise a driver who fails the visual acuity test to seek specialist advice to improve visual acu ity. Some States may offer restricted licenses on a case basis to drivers who even with correction cannot achieve the visual acuity standard. Physical Limitations: 1. Drivers with progressive neuromuscular diseases37 may be required to drive a vehicle that has been modified in order to permit manipulation of all the controls required for safe operation of the vehicle. Only an occupational therapist or a driving rehabilitation specialist is able to evaluate a driver with physical limitations in order to determine the appropriate modifications. 2. Most physical limitations can be accommodated by a vehicle modification. Only a small percentage of drivers must cease driving because of a purely physical limitation. However, when the physical limitation is accompanied by a cognitive limitation, learning to oper ate the modified controls can be difficult. Dementia: 1. A driver who is identified as having a cognitive problem may be required to undergo certain tests that will evaluate problems asso ciated with driving. The primary test is the on-road evaluation but there are tests that are administered in an off-road setting that are also used to evalua te certain cognitive functions necessary for safe driving. These evaluations may be conducted by the DMV4 or by other professionals such as occupational therapists or driv ing rehabilitation specialists. 2. Many jurisdictions will not issue a restricted driver's license to someone with dementia7 because the driver may not be able to comply with the restrictions. 3. The practice of \"co-piloting,\" or having another individual guid e a driver with dementia through the driving task is not safe and should be strongly discouraged. Diabetes \u00a7: 1. Driving with diabetes15 treated with oral drugs or insulin29 can be a challenge. Drivers with diabetes must plan thei r trips taking into considerations the \u00a7 While the above recommendations cam e from the Driver Fitness Working Group, not all experts agree. Alternative viewpoints are presented in Appendix C. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 13 particularities of their m edical condition. Frequent st ops, blood sugar checks every four hours, regular meals or snacks, and good hydration are essential for long trips. 2. Drivers should interrupt their trip if th ey feel symptoms of impending hypoglycemia14 or if their blood sugar is lower than 70 mg/dL. They should not resume driving until they have recuperated completely. 3. Drivers with diabetes 15 treated with oral drugs or insulin29 should wear a bracelet identifying them as having diabetes. 4. Any driver who suffers a hypoglycemic 14 episode necessitating the assistance of another person must cease driving immediat ely and not resume driving until their treating clinician has informed the dr iver that he or she may do so. 5. All drivers with diabetes s hould see their treatin g clinician on a regular basis. The frequency of visits will be determined by the clinician according to their assessment of the clinical situation. Seizures: 1. Drivers with epilepsy16 who require anti-epileptic drugs30 must be monitored in order to avoid drug toxicity. Any driver who suffers from the side effects of AEDs31 should immediately consult the treating clinician. 2. A new seizure 17 must be reported to the tr eating clinician immediately. 3. Drivers with epilepsy should see their trea ting clinicians on a regular basis. The frequency of visits will be determined by the clinician according to an assessment of the clinical situation. Sleep Disorders: 1. Drivers with daytime drowsiness should not drive until the therapy suggested by the treating clinician has been shown to be e ffective. Even then, such drivers should monitor their drowsiness and cease drivi ng immediately if they feel drowsy. 2. CPAP 36 has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment of OSA19. However, once initiated, the treatment must be conti nued for as long as the person wishes to maintain a driver's license. Any interruptions of CPAP, ev en if it's only for one day, can have adverse effects on driving safety. Since CPAP takes at least two weeks to be effective, any interruption in treatment means at least a two-week interruption in driving. 3. Drivers with untreated sleep disorders must not drive if they have daytime drowsiness or sudden onset of sleep. 4. Drivers with an AHI 21 score of 20 or more (\"sleepine ss index\") must not drive unless treated effectively with CPAP or drugs. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 14 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Introduction This chapter examines various conditions that are associated with physic al impairment of the driver. Generally speaking, an individual asse ssment of driver fitn ess is necessary to determine if modifications are appr opriate and if driving is safe. Amputation An amputation38 is the absence of a limb due to a congenital39 limb deficiency or surgical removal of a limb following trauma or illness. The functional implicati on of the absence of a limb is the inability to operate one or more vehicle controls as intended by the vehicle manufacturer. Upper limb amputations limit acc ess and control of the steering wheel, gear selector, directional signal, hor n, lights, and other controls located on the dashboard. Right lower extremity amputations limit access and co ntrol of the vehicle accelerator and brake pedals. Left lower extremity amputations hind er access to the clutch in manual transmission vehicles and the emergency brake in some auto matic transmission vehicles. When the loss of function is permanent, the impact upon driving will depend upon the extent of the loss of function. Minimal limitations may not require modi fication of the driver's vehicle. In fact, the majority of amputees are able to drive th eir own vehicle with no modification since most amputations involve the partial lo ss of one or several fingers or toes that have no affect on the physical functions required for driving. The health care professional must assess the ex tent of the physical limitations and determine if further functional evaluation is indicated. If the health care professional or the DMV have any doubts about the capacity of th e driver to perform the tasks required for driving safely, the driver must be subjected to further assessmen t, usually by an occupational therapist or a driving specialist. In-office ev aluation by a physician is rarely adequate, especially when performed by professionals unversed in the practical aspects of driver evaluation. Since every case must be evaluated on its individual merits , there are no generalised rules of the type \"If you have X, you cannot drive for 3 weeks.\" DMVs must assess each case individually, taking into consideration the in dividual characteristics of the person involved. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Amputation: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any studies that examined the relationship between drivers with amputati ons and safety, specifi cally motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: A single study of sufficient ri gor was conducted examining partial task performance of driving (brake reacti on time) using a repeated measure design to determine the safest, most effective method of operating foot pedals following a right lower Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 15 extrem ity amputation. Meikle, Devlin, and Pauley (2006) studied four different techniques of foot pedal controls in lieu of the absence of the right lower extremity. In measures of reaction time, movement time, total response time, and preferred pedal configuration, it was determined that the slowest technique involved th e prosthesis on the accelerator and left foot on the brake pedal. Use of a left foot accelerator was equivalent to usi ng the right prosthesis on both pedals. Left-footed operation of both vehi cle manufacturer's pedals was the fastest, although not likely realistic for ex tended real-life driving. Table of the Quality of Evidence Driving Pedal Reaction Time After Right Transtibial40 Amputations (Meikle, Devlin, & Pauley, 2006) Objective Determine safety of right transtibial am putees and driving with a prosthetic foot: which of four techniques has fastest reaction times? Level/Design Participants Design: repeated measures (tested reaction, movement, and response time across four pedal configurations during single session in a random sequence; 10 subjects with right transtibial amputations at least 6 months after prosthetic fitting). Intervention and Outcome Measurement Outcome measure: Reaction time, movement time, total response time, and pedal configuration preference. Results Driving reaction times slowest in two-footed driving technique ( P <.001). Total response time comparable using left-sided accelerator versus prosthesis (P =.07). Using left foot to operate both accelerator and brake in conventional right-footed accelerator designing led to fastest reaction and total response times (P<.001). Unclear if realistic driving technique for all amputees. Limitations Small sample size, brief duration of testing, lack of real driving situations, lack of testing of pedal pressure control, and artific ial nature of testing apparatus, results cannot be used to make specific recommendations. This study does not provide adequate evidence to support or op pose use of left-sided accelerator. Other Considerations: Drivers with a right lower extremity amputation38 must be examined for cognitive ability to determine which pedal configurations are r ealistic to understand and learn for safe and consistent operation. If the right lower extremity prosthesis will be used to operate the pedals, careful assessment of sensory aw areness of foot location is criti cal to safe, consistent vehicle operation. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked: Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 16 Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Due to the small sample size and inconclusi ve results, no recommendations can be made about driving with a prosthetic lower extremity, using a left-f oot accelerator, or use of the manufacturer's foot pedals. A two-footed technique with the prosthesis operating the accelerator and left foot operating the brake pedal is not recommended. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 17 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Arthritis Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that is either age-related or caused by overuse, injury, or autoimmune mechanisms. The infl ammation of the joint causes pain, decreased flexibility, instability of the joint, and may result in weakness of the effected limbs or torso. Any condition that affects the upper or lower limb s, the neck, and the back may have an effect on the patient's fitness to drive. The functional implications of arthritis as related to driving are limited ability to operate the vehicle prim ary controls including the foot pedals, steering wheel, ignition, gear selector, safety belt, and any other contro l requiring a reach, strength, or leverage. It is extremely rare that the driver's vehicle cannot be modified to accommodate a physical limitation. However, unless the approp riate evaluation of the driver's needs is performed, the driver may persist in driving a vehicle without modifications, thereby creating a situation that is potentiall y dangerous. Immobilizations of the upper limbs, especially immobilizations of the wrist, hand, or fingers, may have an adverse effect upon the driver's ability to manipulate the controls and the steer ing wheel. Health-care providers tend to ignore the effects of arthritis or other joint problems upon the person's ability to control the steering wheel whereas the simple adaptations could alleviate the person's prehensile problems. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Arthritis: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any studies that examined the relationship between drivers with arthritis and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: A single study of sufficient rigor was conducted to examine the driving performance of individuals with ar thritis, specifically rheumatoid arthritis 41 (RA)42, osteoarthritis43 (OA)44, (FM)47, ankylosing spondylitis48 (AS)49, and miscellaneous arthritis. Jones, McCann, and Lassere (1991) examined 94 drivers with a drivi ng evaluation that in cluded an in-vivo50 road test and found that while many had difficulty with specific aspects of the driving task, 82 percent were able to continue driving with or without minor safety adjustments. Table of the Quality of Evidence Driving and Arthritis (Jones, McCann, & Lassere, 1991) Objective Experience of driving assessment service based in the occupational therapy department of a rheumatology unit. Wanted to define difficulties faced by individuals with different types of arthritis and see how they could be overcome. Level/Design Participants 94 patients assessed. Six categories: RA42, OA44low back pain with or without sciatica45, FM47, AS49, miscellaneous. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Comprehensive driving evaluation including an on-the-road test. Results Drivers with RA showed difficulties in all areas of function, mostly with hand and Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 18 upper limb function and reaching the seat belt. Drivers with OA had problems reversing, steering, cornering, seating, and minimally lower limb functions. Those drivers with back pain/sciatica only had difficulties in seated use of foot pedals, and less frequently reversing, steering, and cornering. Some with FM had a wide range of difficulties, mostly spinal and lower limb function. Reversing was a problem with individuals with AS. Overall, 77 of 94 were considered safe to drive with or without minor safety adjustments. Fifteen were unsatisfactory, while two were deemed unsafe. Limitations Low representation in each category of patients. Other Considerations: Many limitations caused by arthritis can be re duced through adaptive e quipment or adaptive strategies that can improve function, safety, and prevent further joint deterioration. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Individuals with arthritis that disrupts functional performance in other areas of their lives should participate in a comprehensive driving evaluation by a trained driving rehabilitation specialist to determine areas of deficit, need for adaptive e quipment or strategies, and to prevent further joint deformity. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 19 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Cerebral Vascular Accident A cerebral vascular accident23 (CVA51), commonly referred to as a stroke, is caused by a lesion in the brain that can effect visual fields6, hinder attention to one side of the body/environment, reduce problem-solving, in terrupt communication skills for speech, understand spoken language, and impair physical strength, range of motion, coordination, and sensation on one side of the body. The physical f unctional implications of a stroke as related to driving are limited ability to operate the vehi cle controls on the effected side of the body. Drivers with a left CVA may have decreased mo tor control, sensation, and strength on the right side of the body, limiting their ability to op erate the gear selector, ignition, windshield wipers, steer while operating the directional signal, fasten a nd unfasten the seat belt, and operate the accelerator and brake pedals. Drivers with a right C VA may have decreased motor control, sensation, and strength on the right side of the body, lim iting their ability to operate the directional signal, reach for th e seat belt, perform tasks with both hands simultaneously, and operate the clutch on a manual transmission vehicle. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Cerebral Vascular Accident: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study th at examined the relationship between drivers sustaining a C VA and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: A single study of sufficient rigor examined the physical ability to return to driving following a CVA. Lings a nd Jensen (1991) examined driving performance on a simulator and found that individuals with both left and right hemiparesis 52 exhibited decreased reaction time while thos e with right hemiparesis made significantly more errors in driving than their healthy controls. Table of the Quality of Evidence Driving After Stroke: A Controlled Laboratory Investigation (Lings & Jensen, 1991) Objective Determine the capacity of individuals with left- and right-sided CVAs to operate a motor vehicle. Level/Design Participants Descriptive study of 109 people who had sustained CVAs (46 with left hemiparesis; and 67 with right hemiparesis). Intervention and Outcome Measurement Partial task simulator measuring drivin g performance against control groups. Results Left-sided hemiparesis related to reaction time, but spasticity was not associated. No statistically significant differences in the number of errors between the study and control groups. Right-sided hemiparesis : the degree of paresis 53 correlated significantly with reaction times, while no relationship existed between spasticity and reaction time. Significant increase in directional errors compared to the control group ( x 2=7.8, df=1, p <.01). Results illustrate magnitude and severity of difficulties for post Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 20 stroke patients in operating car controls. Limitations Results of simulator-based testing cannot be predicted on basis of a clinical examination alone. An assessment of driving capability can not be made on the basis of clinical examination alone. Other Considerations: An individual who has sustained a CVA51 can present with deficits in several areas, namely visual, cognitive, motor, and sensory. Practitioners and licensing agencies should use caution in making licensing decisions based on outwardly visible limitations. Many individuals can return to safe driving following a comprehe nsive evaluation and training in the use of adaptive equipment. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Given the complicated and variable nature of cerebral vascular accidents with regard to size, location, and severity, individuals should be considered on a case-by-case basis with comprehensive driving rehabilita tion evaluation by a trained driv ing rehabilitation specialist to determine fitness to drive. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 21 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis54 (MS55) is a progressive neurological32 disorder of unknown origin that affects vision (double vision), cognition (problem-solving, atte ntion, and memory), sensation, and physical strength. Individuals with multiple sclerosis may have difficulty visually interpreting the drivi ng environment, traveling through complex driving environments, remembering where they are going, transferring in and out of the vehicle, turning the key in the ignition, feeling the pedals under their feet, rotating the st eering wheel with enough force to turn the vehicle, depressing the foot pedals to stop when necessary, or operating the vehicle while seated in a power wheelchair. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Multiple Sclerosis: Driver Safety: A cohort study examined the rela tionship between a clinically based multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC56) and driving and found a significant correlation to crashes reported to the DMV4 (r = -.40, p<.05) (Shawar yn, Schultheis, Garay, & DeLuca, 2002). Lings (2002) conducted a cohort study examining 10 years of data and found a significant increase of emergency department treatments as a result of automobile crashes among individuals with MS compared to their health counterparts (ratio 3.46). Driver Performance: No sufficiently rigorous evidence exists examining drivers with MS and partial or full task driving performance. Table of the Quality of Evidence Assessing Functional Status: Exploring the Re lationship Between the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and Driving (Shawaryn, Schultheis, Garay, & DeLuca, 2002) Objective Explore the relationship between the MSFC and driving. Level/Design Participants Cohort study with 29 individuals with MS55. Intervention and Outcome Measurement MSFC that measures arm, hand, and, le g function, ambulation, and cognition; Neurocognitive Driving Test (NDT 57); violations and crashes per DMV records. Results Overall score on the MSFC was moderately correlated with the DMV crashes ( r = -.40, p<.05) and not associated with DMV violations (-.18). Subtests of the MSFC were not correlated with DMV violations, DMV crashes, or self-report crashes. Limitations Only individuals with minimal or no physical involvement were included. The period of time for which DMV records were gathered was not reported. Table of the Quality of Evidence Driving Accident Frequency Increased in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis54 (Lings, 2002) Objective Assess the influence of MS55 on the ability to drive safely. Level/Design Participants 10 year cohort study, 197 participants with MS and 545 controls. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 22 Intervention and Outcome Measurement Treatment at the emergency department fo llowing a crash in which the person with MS was the driver. Results Drivers with MS were more likely to be seen in the emergency department from a crash than their healthy counte rparts at a ratio of 3.46 ( p = .04). Crashes with the study group were all collisions with othe r vehicles while the healthy controls collided mostly with fixed object s or without a counterpart. Limitations Only those treated in the emergency ro om were included, which omits smaller crashes that did not involve injury. Other Considerations: Individuals with multiple sclerosis can often drive for extended periods of time following diagnosis with proper evaluations and training in the use of adaptive e quipment to compensate for physical deficits. Careful consideration should be paid to the driver's cognitive status and their ability to learn and safely use new equipmen t. While different classifications of multiple sclerosis exist, published studies do not explicitly identify which types of the disease are included in the studies. Therefore the evidence does not suggest any differences in driving ability or safety based on type of multiple sc lerosis. There is also no evidence to suggest a benefit or risk associated with timing of medi cation for individuals with multiple sclerosis as this variable was not incl uded in the published studies. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Given the complicated and variable nature of multiple sclerosis, potential for visual, cognitive, motor, and sensory impairment, driv ers should be considered on a case-by-case basis with comprehensive testi ng by a trained driving rehabilitation specialist to determine fitness to drive. Also, given the progressive nature of the illness, individuals should be evaluated upon diagnosis to establish baseline scores and periodically thereafter to prolong driving privileges as long as possible. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 23 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease58 is a progressive neurological32 disorder that itself with physical symptoms (akinesia59, tremors60, dyskinesia61, bradykinesia62, postural problems, and joint rigidity), psychiatric (dementia7, confusion, and hallucinations63), and cognitive symptoms (concentra tion, visual perception, processi ng speed, and reaction time). Drivers can have any number of these symptoms to varying degrees depending on the stage of progression and symptom manageme nt with medications. The functional implications for driving include difficulty transferring in /out of the vehicle, reaching for and fastening/unfastening the seat belt, inserting the key in th e ignition and turning, steadily rotating the steering wheel, accurately reaching for vehicle controls on the steering column and dashboard area, turning head to s can environment visually, and smoothly depressing/releasing the foot pedals. Th e psychiatric and cognitive symptoms of PD64 also have driving implications related to difficu lties in timely decision making, judgment, problem solving, attending to the drivi ng task and driving environmen t simultaneously, memory, and navigating through complex driving environments. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Parkinson's Disease: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers with Parkinson's disease and safe ty, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: Much of the research on driv ers with Parkinson's disease has focused on measuring driving performance r eaction time because of the vast number of performance deficits drivers can exhibit. Borromei and colleagues (1999) examined one portion of driving, reaction time, during a simula ted driving task and found that reaction time increased with age, was slower for drivers th an the reaction time nor ms, and was faster in response to aural stimulus compared to visual stimulus. Another study measuring partial task performance measured steering and stopping at a red light against a control group of healthy drivers and revealed that driv ers with PD have less accurac y, slower reaction time, and miss more red lights while those who had progresse d further in the dis ease process performed worse (Madeley, Hulley, Wildgust, & Mindham, 1990). Stolwyk and colleagues also studied partial driving task performance by comparing si mulator driving between drivers with PD and healthy controls. The resear chers found several performan ce discrepancies between the groups including slower approaches to signals, later initiation of decel eration, travel past traffic signals, slower travel through curves, and higher variabili ty in lateral lane position (Stolwyk, Triggs, Charlton, Iansek, & Bradshaw , 2005). While they did find performance differences, they did not find relationships between performance and motor function, including scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 65 (UPDRS66), severity of illness, or reaction time. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 24 Driver Performance continued: Other studies aim ed to find clini cal measures that were predic tive of driving performance on roadways. Most studies found a substantial porti on of the drivers (over half) to be safe with varying results in the ability of other measures to predict driving performance. Grace and fellow researchers (2005) found 67 percent of the partic ipants with PD64 to be safe with predictive tools being the motor scale of the UPDRS66 (specifically postural stability, speech, facial expression, and neck rigidity items), a nd Hoehn & Yahr ratings. Radford, Lincoln, and Lennox (2004) found 64 percent of the participants with Parkinson's58 to be safe with relationships between driving and the Webster's Rating Scale67 and select items from the Stroke Drivers Screening Assessment68 (SDSA69), specifically Dot Cancellation task, Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery70 (AMIPB71) Story Recall, and AMIPB Information Processing A. Uc and colleagues (2007) used similar clinical assessments in their battery while searching for links to driving pe rformance and found that drivers with PD made more errors and tended to drive slower while discovering that cognition and vision tests were better safety predictors than motor assessments. In another effort to identify clinical assessment tools predictive of driving performance, Worringham and colleagues (2006) found the Purdue Pegboard test 79 to be a predictor of pass-fail on th e road test and associated with safety while the UPDRS was not predictive. In a study comparing driving performance between individuals with PD and healthy cont rols, Wood and fellow researchers found that those with PD are significantly less safe than th eir healthy counterparts and scored at a level would have resulted in a failure in the licensing agency's driving test. Table of the Quality of Evidence Ability and Fitness to Drive of Parkinson's Disease Patients (Borromei, Caramelli, Chieregatti, d'Orsi, Guerra, Lozito, et al., 1999) Objective Identify the correlation between PD symptoms and number of accidents when compared to the general population. Level/Design Participants N=204 participants diagnosed with PD, av erage age of female participants was 72.4 years and males was 70.6. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Partial task measure of reaction time was compared to Webster scale and Crichton Geriatric Behavioral Scale. Participants were also asked for the reason why they did or did not drive. Results Reaction time increased with age. Reaction time was slightly faster to aural stimuli (250 msec 72) compared to visual stimuli (338 msec). Both times were slow compared to healthy norms with a 13.5 percent time increase for visual and 10 percent time increase for aural stimuli. Limitations Reaction time alone is not indicative of driving performance. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 25 Table of the Qualit y of Evidence Neuropsychological Deficits Associated wi th Driving Disease12 (Grace, Amick, Abreu, Festa, Heindel, & Ott, 2005) Objective Compare how motor and cognitive function relates to on-road driving performance in individuals with PD64 and Alzheimer's disease. Level/Design Participants Cohort study N = 21 with mild to moderate PD, 21 mild AD13, 21 healthy older adult controls. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Neuropsych battery of tests: - Motor scale of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale65 (UPDRS66) - Hoehn and Yahr Staging Scale73 - Trailmaking Test26 - Finger Tapping Test74 - Standardized road test Results Sixty-seven percent of PD participants were found to be safe drivers but had a mean of 7.6 errors on the road test. Th e finger-tapping test was not predictive of driving safety. Some items on UPDRS motor scale were significantly correlated with driving ability (postural stability, speech, facial expression and neck rigidity). Hoehn and Yahr results of severity of PD were correlated with driving performance (marginal performance). Limitations Small sample size and only included pe ople with mild to moderate PD. Parkinson's Disease and Driving Ability (Madeley, Hulley, Wildgust, & Mindham, 1990) Objective Explore how PD affects driving safety. Level/Design Participants Case control study of 10 drivers with PD , 4 nondrivers diagnosed with PD, and 10 healthy drivers. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Partial task (steering and stopping at a red light) measure of reaction time on a driving simulator Webster's rating scale67 was used to determine the motor impairments of the PD participants. Results Drivers with PD showed impairments in accuracy (U=21.0, p=.01), reaction time (U=17.0, p=.006), and missed red lights (U=34.5, p=.12) when compared against healthy controls. The severity of PD was found to be correlated with driving safety issues for reaction time (r=.53), accuracy (r-, 78), simple reaction (r=.63). Limitations Can not generalize results due to small sample size and selection bias. The Effects of Cognitive Abilities Drivin g in People with Parkinson's Disease58 (Radford, Lincoln, & Lennox, 2004) Objective Create a screening process to determine possible cognitive problems related to driving safety. Level/Design Participants Two group comparison, N = 51 participants diagnosed with PD, age 44 to 85 who currently drive. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Webster's Rating Scale, UPDRS, SDSA69, and a tapping task. Outcome measure: determination of safety with an on road assessment. Results - 33 found to be safe drivers. - Unsafe drivers identified by Webster's Rating Scale. - Correlations were found between the SDSA Dot Cancellation task, AMIPB Story Recall and AMIPB Information Processing A and driving safety (p< .05). Limitations All participants were currently drivin g, therefore the sample may not have accurately represented people with PD. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 26 Impact of Internal Versus External Cueing on Driving Performance in People with Parkinson's Disease58 (Stolwyk, Triggs, Charlton, Iansek, & Bradshaw, 2005) Objective Explore the correlation between neuropsychological75 test outcomes and driving simulator performance. Level/Design Participants Nonrandomized control trial, N = 18 participants diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease58 and 18 control participants, age 54 to 78. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Partial task (negotiating traffic signals and curves) on a driving simulator. Results Compared with controls, participants with PD64 approached signals slower (F [1,34] =3,42; p later ( F[1,34] traffic signals ( F [1,34] =26.76; P<.001), traveled through curves at slower speeds ( F [1,34] =7.13; P =.012), and had higher lateral lane position ( F[1,34] =11.08; P =.002). Motor function, reaction time, and severity of illness were found to not be significantly correlated with the specified driving behaviors. This included the motor section of the UPDRS66, which is widely used to determine the severity of PD64. Limitations Small sample size. Only looked at the co rrelation of the tests to the STI driving simulator and did not look at the predictability of the tests on STI simulator performance. The study also had a sm all sample size with an inaccurate representation of women. Impaired Navigation in Drivers with Parkinson's Disease (Uc, Rizzo, Anderson, Sparks, Rodnitzky, & Dawson, 2007) Objective Investigate driving safety when completing a route-following task76 (RFT77). Level/Design Participants Nonrandomized control trial, N = 77 drivers diagnosed with mild-moderate and 152 healthy driver controls. Intervention and Outcome Measurement - UPDRS - Tapping test74 - Walking speed test - Standardized road test - On-road route-following task Results PD participants made more errors than th e healthy controls. PD drivers tended to drive slower, however there was no significant difference between variability of speed and steering. Found that cognition and vision were better predictors of safety than motor impairments. Limitations All participants still drove, which could exclude people with more severe symptoms. Quantitative Assessment of Driving Performance in Parkinson's Disease58 (Wood, Worringham, Kerr, Mallon, & Silburn, 2005) Objective Determine how PD64 affects driving performance. Level/Design Participants Nonrandomized matched control trial, N = 25 PD participants mostly with moderate systems and 21 controls. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Standardized on-road test. Results Drivers with PD significantly less safe when compared against controls ( t=3.26; p=.002). Fourteen of the 25 drivers with PD scored at a level that would have resulted in failing the licensing agency's driving test. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 27 Limitations Small sample size. Predictors of Driving Assessment Outcome in Parkinson's Disease (Worringham, Wood, Kerr, & Silburn, 2006) Objective Evaluated the ability of functional tests to predict driving performance in PD. Level/Design Participants Nonrandomized matched control trial, N = 25 PD participants mostly with moderate systems and 21 controls. Intervention and Outcome Measurement - UPDRS66 - Aiming task78 - Coincidence- Anticipation - Purdue Pegboard test79 - On-road test Results Purdue Pegboard test was found to be a good predictor of driving ability against pass-fail ( t=3.59; p<.005) and correlated to safety score ( was not predictive of driving and only minimally correlated to safety ( r= -.24). Limitations Small sample size. Other Considerations: Individuals with Parkinson's di sease likely use prescription medi cation to alleviate or manage their symptoms and therefore all medication contraindications80 should be considered, particularly drowsiness as a comm on side effect. There is no evidence to suggest a benefit or risk associated with timing of medication be cause all studies reviewed included a strict inclusion criterion of peak medication levels to control for functional level and reduce confounding variables. Recommendation: Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Most of the existing literature identifies disc repancies in driving perf ormance for individuals with Parkinson's disease58; however a conclusive link to safet y, crashes, injuries, or fatalities has not been made. Due to the highly individu alized nature of the disease and variable progression, individuals in quest ion should participate in a co mprehensive driving evaluation by a trained driving reha bilitation specialist. There was significant variability and even contradi ctions in the studies specific to which tests were predictive of driving performance and sa fety, therefore agencies and providers should use caution when assigning pass-fa il thresholds to assessments for determination of safety or licensure. Licensing agencies and healthcare pr oviders should also use a driving test to measure performance in determini ng medical fitness to drive. Given the progressive nature of the illness, individuals should be evaluated upon diagnosis to establish baseline scores and periodically therea fter to prolong driving privileges as long as possible. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 28 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Spinal Cord Injury A spinal cord injury is a lesion, injury, or severing of the spinal cord that limits or prevents motor and sensory function from the location of the injury down. The severity of functional involvement is highly dependent upon th e location of the injury (cervical81, thoracic82, or lumbar83 region of the spine) and the completeness of the injury (a complete sever versus an incomplete injury in which only some of the spinal cord fibers are affected). The most severe injuries result in total paralysis and sensory lo ss from the location of the injury down to the feet. The functional implicati ons for driving may include (dep ending on the level and severity of the injury) difficulty transferring in/out of the vehicle, fastening/unf astening the seat belt, maintaining an upright sitting position while the ve hicle is moving, turning the key in the ignition, operating the vehicle while seated in a power wheelchair, operating the foot pedals, rotating the steering wheel, se lecting gears, activ ating the directiona l signal, sounding the horn, operating the lights, and any other vehicle c ontrols attached to th e steering column or located in the dashboard area. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Spinal Cord Injury: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers with spinal cord injuries and safe ty, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: No sufficiently rigorous evidence exists examining drivers with spinal cord injuries and partial or full task driving performance. Other Considerations: Spinal cord injuries are highly variable based on vertebral level, completeness of the injury, and level of immediate medical intervention an d therefore should be c onsidered on a case-by- case basis following a comprehensive driving reha bilitation evaluation to determine the need and a capacity for adaptive equipment to compensate for motor loss. Many individuals can return to safe, independent driving following a spinal cord injury with the assistance of a driving rehabilitation evaluation and training in the use of proper adaptive equipment to meet the driver's needs. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 29 Chapter 2: Physical Impairment Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injuries24 can be caused by any number of insults to the head including a fall, automobile crash, gunshot wound, and possibly even a non-traumatic cause such as a tumor. Functional limitations in people who have sust ained brain injuries are highly variable depending on the location and size of the lesion in the brain. There is a array of possible deficit areas that may include one or more of the following: visual changes (double vision, visual field loss, perceptual deficits), cognitive changes (difficulties in problem solving, attention, judgment, memory), and physical cha nges (abnormal muscle tone in any or all of the limbs, impaired balance, decreased strength, contracted joints, decr eased sensation). The functional implication of brain in juries for driving is the inability to operate one or more vehicle controls as intended by the vehicle ma nufacturer. Drivers may have decreased motor control, sensation, and strength, limiting their abil ity to transfer in a nd out of the vehicle, reaching for and fastening/unfastening the seat belt, turn the key in the ignition, operate the gear selector, windshield wipe rs, directional signal, steeri ng wheel, feel and depress the accelerator and brake pedals, and operate the ve hicle while seated in a power wheelchair. Performance of tasks with both hands simultaneously may prove to be particularly difficult. Drivers with visual and/or c ognitive changes may have difficu lty visually interpreting the driving environment, traveling through comp lex driving environments, and remembering where they are going. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Traumatic Brain Injury: Driver Safety: In a systematic review of the literature, McCabe and colleagues (2007) found that while 50 percent of people with severe TBI84 and 75 percent moderate TBI return to driving, those who resume driving against professional recommendations have a higher crash risk. Haselkorn, Meuller, and Rivara (1998) examined the risk of drivers following brain injuries and found that there was no increa sed risk of crashes, but the prevalence of violations increased among thos e with brain injuries. In an attempt to predict driving performance following a brain injury, resear chers examined individuals for one year following their rehabilitation a nd found that measures of motor performance were not predictive, but pre-injury drivi ng, personality, and viol ations were predictive of crashes and violations. Driver Performance: A study using both simulator and on-road measures of driving performance found individuals with brain injuries significantly worse at driving compared to the healthy controls in speed control, direction control, handling of vehicle controls, regulation of trajectory, basic maneuvers, and high- order skills. The road test was not related to driving performance at a 10-month follow up. Additionally, measurement of skills on the simulator was more sensitive and accurate than measurement through professional or family observation (Lew, Poole, Lee, Jaffe, Huang, & Brodd, 2005). Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 30 Table of the Qualit y of Evidence Characteristics of Drivers and Driving R ecord After Traumatic and Nontraumatic Brain Injury (Haselkorn, Mueller, & Rivara, 1998) Objective Determine whether individuals with a TBI84 or stroke23 have an increased risk of subsequent motor vehicle crash or moving violations. Level/Design Participants Retrospective cohort study. Four coho rts of participants; 1,910 with CVA51, 896 with TBI, 4,369 with fractures, and 2,409 with appendicitis. Intervention and Outcome Measurement State records of crashes and citations for 12 months following. Results Drivers with TBI do not have an elevated risk of crashes following hospitalization compared to the matched non-hospitalized cohort. With adjustments for prior driving record, those with TBI had an elevated risk of driving violations (RR = 1.3, 1.0-1.7). Limitations Unable to distinguish severity of brain injury due to retrospective nature of study. Predictive Validity of Driving Simulato r Assessments Following Traumatic Brain Injury24: A Preliminary Study (Lew, Poole, Lee, Jaffe, Huang, & Brodd, 2005) Objective Evaluate whether driving simulator and ro ad tests can predict long-term driving performance. Level/Design Participants Prospective study on 11 patients with moderate to severe TBI. Sixteen healthy subjects tested to provide normative values on simulator at baseline. Time ranged from 2 to 25 months post-TBI. Two phases: 1 month then 10 months later came in again. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Initial evaluation measures: - Simulator Performance Index (SPI 85) - Driver Performance Inventory (DPI86) - Road test 10-month follow up: - Family observation using Driver Performance Inventory Results TBI group scored more than 4 standard devi ations below normal control on SPI (t = 3.83, p=.001) and DPI ( t = 5.36, p<.001). TBI group significantly impaired on both simulator subscales: speed control and direction control. Observational rati ngs of TBI simulator performance were significantly poorer on: - handling of controls; - regulation of trajectory; - basic maneuvers; and - high-order skills. Road test results at evaluation showed no significant relation to driving performance follow-up. Simulator skills more sensitive and accurate than observational skills of measures of simulator. Limitations Small sample size. Untrained person evaluation follow-up performance. Community Reintegration Following Acquired Brain Injury (McCabe, Lippert, Weiser, Hilditch, Hartridge, & Villamere, 2007) Objective Evaluate intervention and strategies to enable transition from acute care or post- acute rehab to community following brain injury. Level/Design Participants Systematic literature review. Intervention Evidence of return to driving in existing literature from 1980-2005. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 31 and Outcome Measurement Results Perino and Rago (1997) estimated only 50 percent of people with severe TBI84 and 75 percent moderate TBI return to drivi ng. Those who resume driving against professional advice have a high crash risk (Formisano et al., 2005). Limitations Lack of randomized control trials. Role of Premorbid87 Factors in Predicting Safe Re turn to Driving After TBI (Pietrapiana, Tamietto, Torrini , Mezzanato, Rago, & Perino, 2005) Objective Explore predictability of safe driving following severe traumatic brain injury24. Level/Design Participants Sixty-six pairs of adults; each pair consisted of one with a brain injury and one healthy relative or significant other. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Measures: - Functional Independence Measure 88 (FIM89)-Functional Assessment Measure90 (FAM91) - Driving records by personal and family report Results About 50 percent of survivors of TBI resume driving; nearly two-thirds did so without specific medico-legal examination or formal evaluation. FIM-FAM scores were not predictive for post-injury driv ing. Factors most predictive were: - # years post-injury - Pre-TBI accidents and violations - Pre-TBI risky personality index - Pre-TBI risky driving style index Limitations FIM-FAM measures are unrelated to driving safety. Other Considerations: Drivers with traumatic brain injuries typically have a variety of deficit areas in addition to risk of seizures and may be using prescription me dication to reduce symptoms. All medication contraindications80 should be considered, including drow siness and medication interactions. For guidance on seizures, please see page 82. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Given the complicated and variable nature of traumatic brain injuries24 based on size, location, and severity, individuals should be considered on a case-by-case basis. While more than half of the individuals with moderate a nd severe brain injuries return to driving, resumption of driving should not be done wit hout a comprehensive dr iving evaluation by a trained driving rehabilitation sp ecialist to properly assess vi sion, cognition, motor, and safe driving performance. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 32 Chapter 3: Vision Introduction Visual standards for drivers cannot be evidence-based since the scien tific evidence to support them does not exist. Although everyone agrees th at vision is essential to driving, there is no consensus on the minimum level of vision necessa ry for safe driving. In fact, as in other fields, some individuals are able to demonstrat e safe driving abilites despite severely limited vision. However, there is consensus that correc ted visual acuity shoul d be 20/100 (6/30) or better and that drivers who do not meet the jurisdiction's standard should be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate safe driv ing despite their legal unfitness. Visual Acuity Impairment Visual acuity5 refers to the spatial resolving ability of the visual system. In other words, it refers to the smallest size detail that a person can see. It is typically measured by asking a person to read a letter chart from a certain pr e-specified distance where the top of the chart has big letters, and as one moves down to succe eding rows on the chart, the letters are smaller in size. It should be tested w ith both eyes open and examined together. Impairments in visual acuity can result from a number of different eye and neurological32 conditions. These conditions include but are not limited to the following: macular atrophy99, diseases amblyopia101, and uncorrected refractive error102 (e.g., uncorrected myopia103). Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Visual Acuity Impairment: Driver Safety: Many studies over the years have exam ined the association between visual acuity and incident crash involveme nt or a history of crash invol vement. These studies are so numerous that they cannot all be listed below, so just a few citations are provided [1-5]. The overriding conclusion that can be drawn from this body of work is that visual acuity has not been related to crash involvement, or at best, is very weakly related to crash involvement. Thus, based on the available eviden ce, it has not been established th at visual acuity testing is a useful screening test to identif y drivers at high risk for crash involvement. However, there are important reasons, as discussed below, that support the continued use of visual acuity screening of applicants for driver licensure. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 33 Driver Safety Continued: It is important to keep in mind the difficu lties encountered in examining the relationship between visual acuity and crash involvement in research. People with severely impaired visual acuity (e.g., worse than 20/ 100) are less likely to be driv ers, and thus they are less likely to be in study samples evaluating this relati onship. They are less likely to be drivers for two reasons - first, many jurisdictions have vision re-screening po licies where people who have acuity worse than a certain level are not granted a license, and second, many people with severely impaired visual acuity voluntarily give up driving or drastica lly reduce the amount of driving they do. Thus, it is difficu lt to evaluate the safe ty records of drivers with severe visual acuity impairment if there are small numbers of these individuals on the road. Many but not all States have vision re-screening policies where re-licensure applicants undergo a visual acuity 5 screening test when they apply fo r renewal of the license. The exact details of these policies vary among States, such as the number of years the renewal applies to, and whether all drivers undergo acuity re-screening at renewal, or only those who fall into certain age groups. Research has evaluated the impact of vision re-screening policies, particularly as they affect fatality rates in older drivers [6-9]. This research suggests that these policies are associated w ith a reduction in fatalities, al though one must be cautious in interpreting the resu lts of these studies sin ce it is unknown exactly what it is about the policy that is associated with the fatality rate reduction (e.g., the visual acuity screen ing test itself, requiring older drivers to go to the licensing office for re-evaluation, or other aspects of the license renewal policy). It is also important to poin t out that there is a growing consensus among those serving on medical advisory boards and researchers alik e that visual acuity down to a level of approximately 20/70 - 20/100 is probably not a threat to safe dr iving. This growing consensus stems from two factors. First, as mentioned above, there is no evidence that people with acuity down to 20/100 are unsafe drivers. And second, an increasing number of jurisdictions are allowing people with visual acuity as low as 20/100 to be licensed if these people can demonstrate driving fitness in an on-road performance evaluation by a driving specialist. Driver Performance: Visual acuity is associated with highway sign le gibility in that those with impaired visual acuity are more likely to make errors in iden tifying signs at a distan ce [10]. This is not surprising since engineers and highway departments se lect a font size for si gns so that the sign can be effectively read at appr opriate braking distances by peopl e who have at least 20/30 or 20/40 acuity or better [11]. Thus people with vi sual acuity worse than this level are likely to experience difficulty reading highway signs a nd street name signs. The design of other aspects of the roadway environment (e.g., lane ma rkings on the pavement) is also predicated on 20/30 - 20/40 acuity and thus the effectiveness of these measures on driver performance is practically linked to the driv er's visual acuity level.

[overview] Other Considerations: When a driver is identified w ho does not meet the visual acuity5 standard for licensure, it is appropriate for the DMV to suggest that the driver seek a comprehensive eye examination from an ophthalmologist or optometrist (in case they have not had one recently). In some cases, the reduced visual acuity might be improved with appropriate treatment (e.g., corrective lenses, cataract93 surgery). Since visual acuity im pairment often has a very gradual onset, particularly in older adults, the person may not be aware that vision has declined. Some jurisdictions allow for the use of the bioptic telescope104 by drivers with visual acuity impairment, and among these jurisdictions, there is wide variability in the eligibility criteria for bioptic driving. It is impor tant to note that there is no cl ear evidence either supporting or opposing the safety of bioptic driving. A few studies have been carri ed out but they are methodologically flawed and do not resolve this issue. Although visual acuity has never been shown to be a good screening test for identifying drivers at high-risk for future crash involveme nt, a visual screening test used at licensing offices does ensure that a driver meets so me minimum level of vision. The critical importance of the acuity test fulfilling this function at licensi ng offices cannot be ignored or denied; the public wants and deserves a govern ment agency that has some method for not Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 35 allowing the licensure of people with serious vision impairment. However, the issue then becomes what should the cut point be for pass versus fail on the visual acuity screening test. As discussed above, the research does not tell us what this cut point should be. Some jurisdictions allow drivers with visual acuity down to 20/100 to drive if they can demonstrate driving fitness in an on-road test by a drivi ng specialist. It is recommended that these jurisdictions evaluate the safety (i.e., crash involvement) of these drivers over time and compare them to drivers who do pass the visual acuity screeni ng test that the jurisdiction administers. This would be very helpful inform ation for jurisdictions that are considering the wisdom of extending licensure of applicant with visual acuity as low as 20/100. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: The use of a visual acuity5 screening test at licensure and re-licensure ensures that a driver meets a jurisdiction's vision standard at the mome nt of licensure or re-licensure. Driving is inarguably a highly visual task, and thus visual acuity screening is an important step jurisdictions take to prevent people with se rious impairment in their central vision from becoming licensed. A positive impact of visual acu ity screening is that it ensures that signs and other critical markings in the roadway e nvironment (lane markings) will be adequately legible to most drivers. Driver re-screening policies that include a visu al acuity screening test have been shown to reduce the fatality rate of older drivers, but it is important to recognize that it remains to be determined what it is about re-screening polic ies that makes them effective in reducing fatality rates. An important advantage that visual acuity screening for licensure or re- licensure offers is that it provides feedback to drivers who fail the screening test that they may need a comprehensive eye examination that might lead to treatments to improve their vision. There are several benefits to visual acuity screening at licensure. However, it is important to recognize that visual acuity is unrelated to or only weakly related to future driver safety (i.e., crash involvement). Thus, visual acuity testing by itself is not an effective way to screen for drivers at high risk for crash involvement. Ot her visual factors (discussed in other sections) are much more important in understanding crash ri sk, particularly in older drivers, than is visual acuity. It is difficult to suggest the a ppropriate pass-versus-fail cut-off that should be used for visual acuity screening. The research to date does not provide an answer to th e \"cut-point\" problem. However, there is an important opportunity going forward that might go far in addressing this question. Specifically, some jurisdictions are al lowing applicants with visual acuity down to 20/100 to drive if they can demonstrate safe dr iving skills in an on-road evaluation conducted by a driving specialist. Comparis on of the motor vehicle collision rate of these drivers to that of drivers who pass the visual acu ity screening test could be very informative as to the safety impact of such a policy. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 36 Chapter 3: Vision Contrast Sensitivity Impairment Contrast105 refers to the light-dark transition at the border or edge of an image or object that defines the existence of a pattern or an object. Contrast sensitivity25 refers to the amount of contrast a person needs in order to detect or identify an object or pa ttern. A person who has poor contrast sensitivity requires a higher contrast to see objects or patterns than a person who has good contrast sensitivity. There are a number of different methods fo r measuring contrast sensitivity. One of the most popular involves re ading letters from a chart. As one moves down the chart, the size of the le tters stay the same, but the cont rast of the letters is reduced such that it is increasingly difficult to read the letters correctly. Impairment in contrast sensitivity can result from a number of different eye and neurological32 conditions. Cataract93 is a common cause of contrast sensitivity impairment in older adults. Other causes of contrast sensitivity impairment 106 include but are not limited to macular degeneration92, atrophy99, diseases amblyopia101, and uncorrected refractive error102 (e.g., uncorrected myopia103). Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Contrast Sensitivity Impairment: Driver Safety: There are very few studies that have examined to what extent contrast sensitivity impairment is associated with an increased crash rate. One study focused on older drivers with cataract and found that older drivers with seriously impaired contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson test scores of 1.25) were much more likely to have a re cent history of at-fault crash involvement compared to those with good contrast sensitiv ity [1]. Another study focused on license renewal applicants and found that the inclusion of a contrast sensitivity test in the vision screening process significantly strengthened the ability to identify older drivers with a recent history of crash involvement [2]. A recent study on a population-based community sample of older adults found no association between contra st sensitivity and incident crash involvement [3]. Driver Performance: A study simulated cataracts in ol der drivers, which caused cont rast sensitivity impairment whereas acuity was still within the vision standard for licensure [4]. On-road driving performance was then evaluated on a closed-roa d course with results indicating that those with impaired contrast sensitivity were more likely to have reduced ability to maneuver the vehicle. A recent study evaluate d driving performance before and after second-eye cataract surgery and found that improvement in contrast sensitivity was predictive of improvement in driving performance following cataract surgery [5].

Bilateral Cataract Surgery and Driving Performance. British Journal of O phthalmology, 90:1277-1280. [moderate] Other Considerations: The California Department of Motor Vehicles has been using contrast sensitivity25 testing on a limited and experimental basis in some license renewal offices. Preliminary results imply this test may add some predictiv e ability to identify drivers at risk for crash involvement beyond that provided by visual acuity5, particularly in those 70 and older. The California studies also revealed that a contrast sensitiv ity screening test was publicly acceptable, brief, and easy for examiners to administer. Results from the final evaluation will not be available for several years. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Since there are not a large number of studies evaluating associations between contrast sensitivity and crash involvement, particularly population-based studies in a license renewal setting, one must be very cautious about making recommendations that it be added as a vision screening test for licensure. The preponderance107 of data thus far, however, does suggest that contrast sensitivity testing may be highly promisi ng as a screening tool for licensure in that it may add something over and above current vision screening appr oaches for identifying older drivers at high risk for unsafe driving. However further evaluation of this issue using population-based samples are needed before a recommendation can be made as to contrast sensitivity's utility as a screening test for licensure. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 38 Chapter 3: Vision Visual Field Impairment The visual field6 refers to one's entire spatial area of vision when fixation is stable, and includes both central108 and peripheral vision109. The size of the visual field is defined in terms of a \"visual angle.\" Fo r an adult with normal vision, when both eyes are open, the visual field extends horizontally about 180 to 200 degrees of visual angl e and vertically about 100 degrees. For each eye individually, the horizont al field is about 160 degrees. The visual field of one eye overlaps with that of the other eye to a very large degr ee, although not totally. The visual field is typically ev aluated using a device called a pe rimeter or a tangent screen. Visual fields should be tested with both eyes open and examined together. Impairment in the visual field can result from a number of different eye and neurological32 conditions including but not limited to glaucoma95, optic neuritis94, diabetic retinopathy98, brain injury (e.g., stroke, trauma, tumor), retinal degenerations (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa96), and eye trauma. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Visual Field Impairment : Driver Safety: The research literature on visual field impairment110 and driver safety does not provide a clear answer as to what types of visual field impairment and what degree of visual field impairment is a threat to safe dr iving. What literature on this topic does exist provides some general information, but little in the way of specific data that could serve as a basis for recommendations or guidance. Visual field impairment appears to elevate crash risk when it is serious (covers a great deal of the visu al field with severe lig ht sensitivity loss) and when it is binocular (i.e., occurs in both ey es) [1-4]. However, what is unknown is how spatially extensive the visual defects must be , and how severe the light sensitivity deficits must be, before safe driving is threatened. In addition, it remains unknown to what extent drivers with severe visual field impairment can compensate for their field impairment through scanning eye and head movements. If field loss is in only one eye, driver safety does not appear to be affected [1]. Driver Performance: A study on simulated binocular visual field loss and driving performance on a closed course showed that when the diameter of the visual field was reduced to 40 degrees or 20 degrees, drivers sh owed decrements in th eir ability to identify road signs, avoid obstacles, and maneuver th rough limited spaces, with the 20-degree field causing more severe decrements than the 40-degr ee field [5]. In another study, most drivers with moderate binocular visu al field loss (i.e., horizontal field ranging from 78 to 165 degrees) displayed acceptable on-road driving skills [6], although another study showed that some had problems with peripheral obstacle detec tion [7]. Given that there are so few studies on driving performance and visual field impairment, it is difficult to make any conclusions about the driving capabilities of people with various types of fi eld loss and various degrees of impairment.

[moderate] Other Considerations: As mentioned above, there is a paucity of inform ation from the research literature as to the safety of drivers with visual field6 impairment. Given this situ ation, a fair approach when considering the appropriatene ss of licensure of a driver with visual field impairment110 might be to have a driving specialist evaluate the driving skills of th e individual under a variety of on-road driving situations. Based on this in formation (and any other information required by the jurisdiction), the juri sdiction and its medical review sta ff could then make a decision about licensure. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Given that there is a shortage of informati on on the safety of drivers with visual field impairment, the only recommendation that can be ma de is that which is stated in the section on \"Other Considerations.\" One approach when considering the approp riateness of licensure of a driver with visual field impairment might be to have a driving specialist evaluate the driving skills of the individual under a va riety of on-road driv ing situations. Recommendation or Guidance Statement Continued: Using this information (and any other info rmation required by the jurisdiction), the jurisdiction and its Medical Advisory Board could then make a decision about licensure on a case-by-case basis. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 40 Chapter 3: Vision Color Vision Deficits Color vision deficit111 is a general term that refers to impairment in the ability to discriminate among colors, and can either be inherited, or acq uired later in life. There are many different types of color vision deficits. There ar e many screening tests for detecting color discrimination problems. The public often refers to color vision deficits as \"color blindness.\" Inherited forms of color vision deficits are much more common among men than women, with an estimated 8 percent of the male popul ation affected by these conditions. Acquired color vision deficits can be caused by many conditions includ ing but not limited to macular atrophy99, brain injury (e.g., stroke, trauma, tumor), a nd diseases of the cornea100. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Color Vision Deficits: Driver Safety: A review of the literatu re on color vision and driving indica tes that color deficiency does not elevate the risk of crash involvement [1]. Driver Performance: Color deficiency may theoretically pose difficu lty in interpreting traffic control devices in some situations; however the critical cues from these signals can be generally obtained from multiple sources of information, allowing drivers with color vision deficits to compensate. Reference Number Compete Citation (With Quality of Evidence) 1 Vingrys, A. J., & Cole, B. L. (1988). Are Color Vision Standards Justified for the Transport Industry? Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics, 8:257-274. [overview] Other Considerations: Some color deficiencies that are acquired (in other words, they are due to eye or neurological32 conditions that are not inhe rited or present from birth) can co-occur with other types of vision impairments (for example, visual acuity5 impairment). In these situations, while the color vision problem itself may not be a source of driver sa fety and performance problems, the other visual problems could lead to unsafe driving. Thus, it is important to consider several aspects of visi on during the licensure process (see other parts of this report). Currently there are Federal policies that re quire color vision scr eening for drivers of commercial vehicles, buses and similar vehicl es that come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration112 (FMCSA113). The present document speaks to the issue of drivers of personal vehicles and does not address vision-screening standards under FMCSA jurisdiction. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 41 Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Drivers must be able to discriminate between the different traffic lights, but color vision deficiency by itself should not be a barrier to obtaining a driv er's license for a personal vehicle. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 42 Chapter 3: Vision Slowed Visual Processing Speed This functional deficit refers to a slowing in the speed at which a person processes visual information, particularly as related to rec ognizing and identifying objects and patterns and making decisions about them. Many tests have been developed to assess visual processing speed; among the most common are the Trails A and B tests26. Slowed visual processing speed is common among older adults, peopl e with brain injury (e.g., stroke23, trauma, tumor), and older adults with Alzheimer's disease12. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Slowed Visual Processing Speed114: Driver Safety: Several studies have shown that slowed visual processing speed in older drivers is associated with crash involvement [1-3]. Driver Performance: Several studies have shown that slowed visual pr ocessing speed is associated with deficits in on-road and simulator driving performance [4-7]. Other Considerations: Tests of visual acuity5, visual fields6, and contrast sensitivity25 do not screen for visual processing speed, and thus will not identify drivers with slowed visual processing speed114.

Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non- existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Since slowed processing speed ha s been repeatedly shown to be associated with driver safety and performance problems, jurisdictions should consider implementing a screening test for licensure and/or re-licensure that assesses processing speed. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 44 Chapter 3: Vision Hemianopia Homonymous hemianopia115 is a visual field impairment110 where complete or near complete loss of light sensitivity occurs in one half of the visual field6 on the same side in visual space. In other words, when the person with hemianopia gazes straight ahead, one half of the person's visual world, either on the right or left, is largel y absent. Hemianopia can be confirmed by an ophthalmologist, neurologist, or opt ometrist using a visual field test. It is caused by damage to the visual pathway due to a brain injury, the most common causes being stroke23, trauma, or tumor. A relate d condition is called quadrantanopia116, in which there is a loss of sensitivity in one-quarter (or one quadrant) of the visual field. It is also caused by brain injury. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Hemianopia Driver Safety: There are no previous studies that have ex amined the relationship between hemianopia and crash involvement. Driver Performance: A few studies have examined driving performan ce in people with hemianopia, either on-road driving or performance in a driving simulator [1-4]. Results suggested some but not all drivers exhibited problems with on-road stee ring steadiness and vehi cle control skills. However, some drivers with hemianopia or quadrantanopia who were evaluated on-road displayed driving skills that we re indistinguishable from people who had normal visual fields and were rated as safe driv ers by the driving specialist.

[moderate] Other Considerations: Several studies on hemianopia115 and driving performance have methodological limitations that preclude their being generalized to people with hemianopia at large. Some of these problems include study samples that are small, a focus on drivers who were known to have Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 45 driving problem s even before they are evalua ted, and drivers who are only two months from the time of their brain injury so are they sti ll in the process of recovering. Recent work has demonstrated that some drivers with hemianopia can display safe drivi ng skills and drive in a manner that cannot be differentiated from the driving of people with normal visual fields6. The fairest approach may be to allow license applican ts with hemianopia to be evaluated by a driving specialist before determining the suitability of licensure. Currently, many jurisdictions categorically deny people with hemianopia licensure on the basis of the jurisdiction's visual field requirement, without ever evaluating the person's actual driving performance. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Drivers with hemianopia or quadrantanopia116 should be given the opportunity for a comprehensive on-road evaluation by a driving specialist, and if judged fit to drive, should be given the opportunity to take the jurisdiction's road test. Given the wide individual variability in driving skills of people with hemianopia, it could be viewed as unfair for jurisdictions to categorically deny licensure to people with hemianopia or quadra ntanopia without the opportunity for them to demonstrate safe driving skills. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 46 Chapter 3: Vision Age-Related Macular Degeneration Age-related macular degeneration92 is the leading cause of irreversible vision impairment for older adults in many countries including the Unite d States and Canada. In its advanced stages it causes a serious loss of central vision108 including visual acuity5 impairment and contrast sensitivity impairment106. Peripheral vision109 is not impacted by AMD117 and thus the extent of the visual field6 for people with AMD is comparable to those without AMD. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Age- Related Macular Degeneration (AMD, ARM or ARMD) Driver Safety: A recent review of the literature on AMD and dr iving indicated that li ttle to nothing is known about the safety of drivers with AMD. As mentioned above, advanced AMD can cause serious visual acuity impairment, so the reader is referred to the se ction on visual acuity impairment for guidance on this functional impairment. Driver Performance: A recent review of the literature on AMD and dr iving performance indicated that little to nothing is known about driving performance in people with AMD. As mentioned above, advanced AMD can cause serious visual acuity impairment, so the reader is referred to the section on visual acuity impairment for guidance on this functional impairment. Reference Number Compete Citation (With Quality of Evidence) 1 Owsley, C., & McGwin Jr., G. (2008) Drivi ng and Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Journal of Vision Impairment and Blindness, 14, in press. [overview] Other Considerations: It is important to keep in mind that AMD has a wide spectrum of disease severity, and simply because a person has AMD does not mean that they have serious vision impairment. In the early phases of AMD, visual acuity is often within normal range and would meet the vision standard in most jurisdictions. Even in the in termediate stages of AMD, good visual acuity or only moderate impairments can occur. Thus, it is important to emphasize that drivers with AMD should not be stigmatized as having seriousl y impaired visual acuity, when in fact for many of these drivers, this will not be the case. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 47 Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Visual acu ity5 can be seriously impaired in the inte rmediate to advanced stages of AMD117, although there is considerable variability in what level of acuity impairment manifests itself in a given person. Thus, simply because a person has intermediate or advanced AMD does not mean that the person should be denied licensure . They, like all driver applicants, should be evaluated with the visual acuity screening te st and appropriate road tests used by their jurisdiction. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 48 Chapter 3: Vision Cataract Cataract93 refers to an increased opacification118 of the lens in the eye. In other words, the lens becomes cloudy thus causing objects and patt erns to look washed out, blurry, and/or indistinct. The most common form of cataracts, by far, is age-related cataracts that occur in the later decades of life. Age-related cataracts do not come on suddenly but typically develop over a period of years. Cataracts cause vision impairment, especially visual acuity5 and contrast sensitivity impairment106. Cataracts are highly treatable in that vision impairment can be substantially reversed by surgical cataract re moval and intraocular le ns insertion (typically an outpatient procedure). Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Cataract: Driver Safety: Cataracts that are clinically significant and causing vision impairment are associated with a history of crash involvement [1]. Furthermor e, older adults with cataracts who underwent surgery had a rate of crash involvement that was 50 percent lower than older adults with cataracts who did not undergo surgery [2]. It appears that contrast sensitivity impairment underlies the increased cras h risk in older drivers with cataracts [3]. Driver Performance: A study evaluated driving performance before and after second-eye cataract surgery and found that driving performance significantly improved following cataract surgery and the degree of improvement was associated with the degree of improvement in contrast sensitivity25 [4].

[moderate] 4 Wood, J. M., & Carberry, T. P. (2006). Bilateral Cataract Surgery and Driving Performance. British Journal of O phthalmology, 90:1277-1280. [moderate] Other Considerations: Cataract93 has a wide range of severity, and in it s earliest phases may not noticeably impair vision. When cataracts develop to the point of impairing vision and interfering with the person's performance of the visu al activities of daily living, health insurance (including Medicare) typically covers the co st of surgical removal and intr aocular lens insertion in order to reverse vision impairment (typi cally an outpatient procedure) . Thus, cataracts are a highly Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 49 treatable condition. If a person with significan t, vision-im pairing ca taracts would like to maintain licensure and the ability to drive safely, cataract surger y is considered for most of these individuals to be an effective treatme nt option for both improving vision and enhancing driver safety. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: A diagnosis of cataract per se should not preclude licensure. However, when clinically significant cataracts are present, contrast sensitivity25 is typically seriously impaired, as is visual acuity5. When contrast sensitivity or visual acuity impairment due to cataract becomes severe, the driver in consulta tion with their ophthalmologist should consider any potential benefits that cataract surgery might have for improved driver safety. See also recommendation under visual acuity impairment a nd contrast sensitivity impairment. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 50 Chapter 3: Vision Glaucoma Glaucoma95 is a leading cause of ir reversible vision impairment in many countries including the United States and Canada. Glaucoma, a dise ase where the optic nerv e degenerates, causes visual field impairment110 and in its advanced stages can al so lead to loss of central vision108 including impaired visual acuity5 and contrast sensitivity25. Increased pressure inside the eye is a common characteristic of glaucoma, a lthough one can have glaucoma but not have high eye pressure. Glaucoma can o ccur at any age but is more common among adults age 40 or older. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Glaucoma Driver Safety: One study did find that self-reported glaucoma (rather than that diagnosed in a medical record) was associated with in creased crash involvement, alt hough it is important to point out that self-reports of conditions such as glaucoma can be quite unreliable [1]. A recent study showed that having a diagnosis of glaucoma in the medical record was not associated with crash involvement [2]. However, among those who have glaucoma, moderate to severe visual field impairment can elevate crash risk, particularly if the field loss is in both eyes [3, 4]. Driver Performance: There are only a small number of studies on driving performance by people with glaucoma. One study examined on-road driving performance in a sample of drivers with visual field loss due to glaucoma [5]. These dr ivers did not have se vere field loss, but minor to moderate binocular visual field loss (i .e., horizontal field ranging fr om 78 to 165 degrees). They displayed acceptable on-road driving skills. Another study [6] examined on-road driving performance in drivers with minor to moderate field loss and also found that these drivers performed most driving skills appr opriately. However, the study al so reported that they were more likely to have difficulties in seeing pe ripheral hazards than di d drivers with normal visual fields.

Investigative Ophthalmology and Visu al Science, 49:3035-3041. [moderate] Other Considerations: It is important to keep in mind that glaucoma95 has a wide spectrum of disease severity, and simply because a person has glaucoma does not mean the person has a serious visual field impairment110. In the early phases of glaucoma95, visual field impairment is often minor and only in one eye, and the horizontal visual field6 for both eyes together would meet the vision standard in most jurisdictions. Thus, it is impor tant to emphasize that drivers with glaucoma should not be stigmatized as having seriously impa ired visual fields when in fact for many of them this will not be the case. There is a great deal of variab ility in the driving performan ce of people with glaucoma who have visual field impairment. Although research has not yet addressed this issue, the more successful drivers may be using scanning strategies to compensate for visual field loss. This suggests that some drivers with glaucoma w ho are having driving diffi culties could benefit from rehabilitation programs that teach these strategies. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: A diagnosis of glaucoma95 per se should not preclude licensure. Serious visual field impairment110 in both eyes from glaucoma is likely to elevate crash risk. However, how serious field impairment should be defined and where the cut point should be cannot be determined from existing research. As discussed in the visual field impairment section, a fair approach when considering the appropriateness of licensure of a driver with visual field impairment might be to have a driving specialis t evaluate the driving skills of the individual under a variety of on-road driv ing situations. Based on this information (and any other information required by the jurisdiction), the ju risdiction could then make a decision about licensure. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 52 Chapter 3: Vision Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy98 is a vascular complicat ion of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes where blood vessels in the eye swell and leak or abnormal new blo od vessels grow. (For more information on diabetes see page 72.) There are several stages of diabetic retinopathy, and vision can range from relatively normal to severe ly impaired. Diabetic retinopathy can impair vision in several different ways, including causing impairments in visual acuity5, contrast sensitivity25 and/or visual field6. Good control of blood sugar decreases the risk for vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Diabetic Retinopathy Driver Safety: There have been no studies on diabet ic retinopathy and crash involvement. Driver Performance: There have been no studies on diabetic retinopathy and driv ing performance. Other Considerations: See section on diabetes for a discussion of this issue. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Visual acuity and the visual fields can be se riously impaired in diabetic retinopathy, although there is considerable variability in what le vels of acuity and visual field impairment110 manifests itself in a given person. Thus, simp ly because a person has diabetic retinopathy does not mean that the person should be denied licensure. They, like all driver applicants, should be evaluated with the vision screen ing tests used by th eir jurisdictions. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 53 Chapter 4: Medical Conditions Introduction This chapter groups together the most common medical conditions associ ated with increased driver risk. These conditions differ from the previous chapters in that they may not lend themselves to on-road assessment. The episodic nature of epilepsy and diabetes mean that there may not be any functional limitations between episodes of total or partial incapacity. However, the evolutive nature of most of th ese conditions means that functional limitations may occur that could require functional evalua tion. Each case will require individual assessment to determine the appropriate means of evaluation. Dementia Dementia7 is impairment in short-term and long-term memory, associated with impairment in abstract thinking, impaired judgment, other di sturbances of higher cortical function, or personality change. The disturbance is seve re enough to interfere significantly with work, usual social activities or relations hips with others. The diagnosi s of dementia is not made if these symptoms occur in delirium119. Among the many causes of dementia, the neurodegenerative disorder120 Alzheimer's disease12 is the most common and vascular dementia (caused by strokes23) is the next most common. Ot her neurodegenerative causes of dementia include Parkinson's disease58, brain tumors, trauma, and chronic alcoholism. Multiple sclerosis54 sometimes causes dementia as can brain infections including viral encephalitis121, late-stage syphilis122, and HIV/AIDS123 as well as other rare disorders. Metabolic124 causes of dementia include hypothyroidism125, and Vitamin B12 and other vitamin deficiencies and poisons, such as heavy metal (e.g., lead) poisoning. In mild cognitive impairment, older individuals demonstrate cognitive impairments that are greater than those expected with normal aging, but are not sufficient to diagnose dementia. Cognitive impairments in dementia can reduce driver perfor mance and increase the risk of driver errors that can lead to a vehicle crash. Based on popul ation aging trends, the number of individuals who meet the criteria for dementia is exp ected to triple by mid-century, with clear implications for driving risk. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Dementia: Driver Safety: To maintain their autonomy, individuals may be encouraged to continue to drive until they meet some societal or lega l criteria for unsafe driving. Risk assessment depends on driver competence and the amount and type of driving exposure. Private clinicians do not directly m easure driving competence and must infer it from demographic, historical and cognitive measures , but these estimates may disagr ee with direct clinical and behind the wheel assessments of occupationa l therapists or driving rehabilitation professionals. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 54 Driver Safet y Continued: Evidence of linkages between c ognitive abilities measured by neuropsychological75 tasks and driving behavior assessed us ing driving simulators, road tests, and State crash records can help standard ize the assessment of fitness-to-drive. Driver Performance: There is consensus that suspicion of the possibility of a diagnosis of dementia should immediately trigger a functional ev aluation of the driver's fitness to drive. Some experts go so far as to suggest that any cognitive deficit, particularly a newly observed deficit, should also trig ger a functional evaluation. Although there is unanimous agreement that seve re dementia is incompatible with safe driving, precluding the requirement for a functional evaluation, the cogniti ve deficiencies in mild and moderate dementia are so varied that predicting on-road driving performance on the basis of the results of the vari ous tests used to evaluate cogni tive defects is impossible. Self-awareness/insight and judgmen t are vital to safe driving but are difficult to measure in cognitive tests. Even when the off-road ex aminer can identify problems with insight and judgment it is still not easy to predict driver performance. Consequentl y, except in the most extreme cases, which should probably be classified as severe rather than moderate dementia7, the road test is an integral part of the functional evaluation of driving skills. A number of tests have been identified as usef ul in predicting driver performance. Useful Field of View 232 (UFOV233), Trail Making A and B26, and similar tests are useful in identifying drivers who may perform badly on road tests. Unfortunately, the predictive power of these tests is not sufficient for licensing decisi ons to be based solely on the results of these and similar tests. The Mini Mental Status Exam 27 (MMSE28), or Folstein test, is a screening tool useful in identifying people with a cognitive problem that requires furthe r assessment. Although it has some predictive value as far as on-road perf ormance is concerned, it cannot be used to exclude the person from hol ding a driver's license. A score of 24/30 or less on the MMSE equates to a 70-percent chance of failure on the road test and a score of 19/30 to a 95- percent failure rate. However, a score of 24 also equates to 30-percent chance of success and no method of identifying into which group a particular individual will fall has yet been devised. Consequently, an MMSE score, by itself, is insufficient to justify suspension of a driver's license. Even a score of 30/30 on the MMSE does not preclude the chance of failure on the road-test. Since the MMSE does not evalua te insight or judg ment, deficiencies in these areas are possible with such a result. The bottom line is that the health care profe ssional who suspects a cognitive problem, no matter what the MMSE result, should insist upon a functional assessment. The same is true when the MMSE result is abnormal. Ideally health care professiona ls would detect the potentially compromised patient before there is a road-safety-related in cident. Unfortunately, this is not the case, partly because most he alth professionals have little knowledge or awareness of the road safety implications of many medical conditions, including mild dementia. However, the diagnosis of dementia can be difficult and the first sign of cognitive problems may be the in cident at the wheel. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 55 Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: 1. Applicants with a clinical di agnosis or history of dementia7 who seek a license to drive a motor vehicle should be examined and certified fo r functional ability at periodic intervals by a qualified clinician with appropriate neurological32 training and expertise. Neuropsychological75 assessment may also be needed. 2. DMVs4 may be able to screen for drivers who need neurological examination by observation, interview, and questionnaire. In addition, DMV personnel may be able to apply simple screening tools (e.g., MMSE28, Trail Making Test26). Criteria for triggering referral for neurological assessment could include at least two of the following: (1) Age 80 years old or greater; (2) History of a recent crash or moving violation; (3) Applicant self-report or caregiv er report of impaired skills; (4) Use of psychoactive medications 126 such as benzodiazepines127, neuroleptics128, antidepressants129, or use of medications for Alzheimer's disease130 (AD131); (5) History of activ e alcohol abuse; (6) History of falls; (7) Inability to understand or hear instructions during interactions with the DMV 4 examiner or the health professional; (8) Scores with simple screening tools that i ndicate the possibility of a cognitive deficit; or (9) Inability to complete the DMV knowledge test. 3. Applicants must present themselves for a neurological or neurops ychological evaluation when directed by their State DMVs, and submit a copy of the clinician's report to the DMV at the time of the recertification. 4. Medical assessments of drivers with possible dementia must include results of screening tests, such as the MMSE or C linical Dementia rating scale 132 (CDR133). An MMSE score of less than 24 is generally, but not absolutely, correlated with unsafe driving. Drivers with scores of 17 and below are proba bly (but not always) unsafe to drive. Applicants with a MMSE of 17 or below (reflecting moderate de mentia) who are certif ied to drive should possibly be reconsidered for re-evaluation for driving competence at 6-month intervals. 5. A driver who is identified as having a cognitive problem may be required to undergo certain tests that will evaluate problems associated with drivi ng. The primary test is the on- road evaluation but there are test s that are administered in an off-road setting that are also used to evaluate certain cogni tive functions necessary for safe driving. These evaluations may be conducted by the DMV4, occupational therapists, or driv ing rehabilitati on specialists. Many jurisdictions will not issue a conditional driver's license to someone with dementia7. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 56 6. As a group, patients w ith CDR133 of 0.5-1 should probably be c onsidered to be at higher risk for failing an on-road driving test. Patients with a CDR of 1 are at a slightly higher risk than those with CDR 0.5. However, CDR of 0.5-1 patients should probably not be categorically considered to be unsafe, as a s ubstantial percentage ca n still pass an on-road driving test. Patients with a CDR of 1 (reflecting moderate dementia) should possibly be reconsidered for re-evalu ation for driving competence at 6-month intervals. 7. Tests of attention, executive functioning, visuospatial 134 skills, and memory should be applied in neurological32 assessments of applicants who screen positive for dementia. In Alzheimer's disease12 there is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Trails A and B Test26, the UFOV233, the Judgment of Line Orientation Test135 (JLO)136, the Block Design Test137, the Benton Visual Retention Test138 (BVRT)139, the Complex Figure Test140 (CFT141), and the Facial Recognition Test142. In Parkinson's disease58, there is sufficient evidence to recommend tests of executive functioning, a nd visuospatial skills for use in driving assessments. There is also evidence to recommend the use of Trails B. In general, scores on these tests that are compatible with moderate dementia should be considered as predictive of unsafe driving. Drivers who show unawaren ess of cognitive impairment should not be certified to drive. 8. Applicants with greater numbers of risk factors should be consider ed at greater risk, although the relative risks are not necessarily additive. Additi onal factors besides screening and neuropsychological 75 test scores to consider are history of crashes, applicant self-report of fair skills, family member or ca regiver report of fair skills, ap plicant habits (self restriction, aggression, impulsivity, and alcohol abuse) and use of psychoactive medications8 benzodiazepines9, neuroleptics10, tricyclics143, narcotic analgesics144. 9. In dementing disorders in which we do not have sufficient evidence to draw statistical conclusions on driver sa fety, it is reasonable to apply th e same safety standards as for applicants with Alzheimer's disease until proven otherwise (even if different tests may have differential predictive validity for different types of dementia). 10. Applicants with dementia must be capable of providing informed consent in order to be considered for certification to dr ive. The applicants should be judged on if they are able to comply with all medical therapy (e.g. , blood pressure medications, diabetes 15 medication, dopaminergic medications145, spectacles, hearing aids) and un likely to have reduced driving ability due to complications affecting other systems (e.g., vision, auditory, cardiovascular, psychiatric) mediating abilities that are critical to safely operating a motor vehicle. They must present themselves for neurological or neurops ychological evaluations when directed by their State licensing authority, and subm it a copy of the neurological re port to the DMV at the time of the recertification. 11. Driver training programs should be considered, but there is no evidence as yet that they work in dementia7, and completion of driver training or education is not a factor in recertification. 12. There is insufficient evidence to recommend countermeasures such as restricted driver licenses in drivers with dementia. There is concern among some e xperts that issueing Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 57 restricted licenses to individuals with dem entia may falsely give the impression that they are deemed safe to drive, when in fact, they are deemed not safe w ithout the restrictions. 13. The practice of \"co-piloting,\" or having anothe r individual guide a dr iver with dementia through the driving task should be strongly discouraged by hea lth care professionals. DMVs should not issue restricted licen ses that are contingent on a dr iver with dementia having a passenger. 14. Adjudication of cases in which an individual is deemed unlikely to be fit to drive by a certified neurological 32 practitioner, in which the individu al insists on further deliberation of driving privileges, should be made by the DMV4, including consideration of a road test.

Alcohol -related relative risk of driver fatalities and driver involvement in fatal crashes in rela tion to driver age and gender: an update using 1996 data. Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 61:387-95. Evidence: 1. Effects of Aging on Driving Competence In a prospective study, driver's age > 78 increased the odds of future crashes in the next 4 to 5 years (OR 1.26 (1.01, 1.57), multivariate regression) (Ball, 2006). In a DMV study, increasing age correlated with poorer perfor mance on a test to resume driving (OR not available) (Janke, 1998). In a longitudi nal study of drivers with aging and AD 13, the Cox proportional hazard ratio of dr iving cessation increased over a year (HR: 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) (Duchek, 2003) Class 2 studies gave mixed results. Three st udies used an on-the-r oad test: one study of normal drivers found that older drivers made fewer errors (C arr, 1992). Age did not differ between fit and unfit drivers with PD 64 or AD13 and elderly controls (Grace, 2005). In the third, age (corrected for MMSE28) correlated with driving score (0-3) worsened with age (Pearson's r = -0.43) (Odenheimer, 1994). In a 5-year study of community-dwelling ag ing drivers (7.3% with possible cognitive impairment), increasing age predicted driving ce ssation at the next yearly assessment (Antsey, 2006). The OR for each 1-year increase in age in the second year was OR 1.11, (95% CI 1.02,1.20); third year OR 1.21, (1.13,1.31); fourth year OR 1.19, (1.13,1.26); but was not significant for the fifth year. In a survey st udy of older nondemented drivers renewing their licenses, increasing age predicted health status ( r2 = 0.19), driving avoidance ( r2 = 0.19) and driving exposure ( r2 = -0.22) (Vance, 2006). In a Class 2 st udy, increasing ag e in the control group correlated with po orer performance in an on-the-road test ( r = 0.45) (Whelihan, 2005). Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 58 Two Class 3 studies found that increasing age d ecreased the odds of continuing to drive. (Adler, 2003; Foley, 2000). In th e three studies using governm ental crash data, crash rates per million vehicle miles of travel were greater for youngest and the oldest drivers than for middle-age drivers (16 and 11 versus 4) (Kim, 1998; Langford, 2006; Li, 2003). Drivers > 75 years old had a greater proportion of crashes involving judgment erro rs at intersections (Langford, 2006). A simulator study found increasing age was poorly associated with failure rate (Di Stefano, 2003). One study found that ol der drivers exhibited more flexibility in route-finding and confidence in their route-finding abilities during a computerized route- finding task with continuous traffic updates (Walker, 1997). Comment: Age alone probably does not predict crash risk. Increasing age is associated with more driving errors, more crashes, and future driving cessa tion (classes 1-3). Yet olde r drivers also decrease their driving exposure, with some mitigation of driv ing risk (classes 2, 3). Increasing age is probably not an independent risk factor for decreased competence. 2. Relationship Between Global Measures of Dementia7 Severity and Driving Competence (a) Mini Mental Status Exam27 (MMSE28) MMSE score and on-road driving test perfor mance tend not to correlate unless a study population includes MMSE scores < 24. For ex ample, in one Class 2 case control study (Odenheimer, 1994) where the mean MMSE score for cases was 14.8, there was a significant correlation (r = .72, p<0.01). Another Class 2 study (Fitten, 1995) demons trated a correlation (r = 0.63) for those with MMSE scores < 24; above 24, there was no correlation. When the study population is primarily or exclusively t hose with MMSE scores greater than 24, two Class 2 studies (DeRaedt, 2001a, Grace, 2005) failed to demonstrate correlations with on-road driving test scores. In a Cl ass 3 study (Johannsen, 1996), 78 percent of suspended drivers had an MMSE score above 25. An MMSE score of less than 24, however, does not completely correlate with unsafe driving. In a Class 2 study (Kantos, 2004), when patients with scores less than 24 and co-morbid conditions (e.g., slow reaction time s, visual problems) were excluded, a score of less than 24 did not significantly increase the odds of failing (OR 1.20, 0.73-20). Comment: MMSE scores of 24 or above should probably not be considered to be sensitive in discriminating between safe and unsafe drivers. An MMSE score of less than 24 is generally, but not absolute ly, correlated with unsafe drivi ng. Drivers with scores of 17 and below are probably, but not always, unsafe to drive. b) Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 132 (CDR133) One Class 1 and three Class 2 studies analyzed on-road driving test performance and CDR scores. In the Class 1 study (Brown, 2005), compared to drivers with CDR 0, the RR for unsafe driving for those with CDR 0.5 was 82.7 (5.1, 1333); for CDR 1 vs. 0, the RR was 88.67 (5.4, 1444). Yet, 46 percent of the CDR 0.5 group and 41 percent of the CDR 1 group passed the test, compared to 84 percent of controls. The first Class 2 study (Hunt, 1997) found that drivers with a CDR of 0.5 had a RR of 9.67 (2.3, 40.7) for being judged unsafe in a comparis on to drivers with a CDR of 0, drivers with CDR of 1 had an RR was 12 (2.8, 50.1). Howe ver 67 percent of the CDR 0.5 group and 41 percent of the CDR 1 group still passed th e test, versus 78 percent of controls. In the second study (Duchek, 2003), drivers with CDR133 of 1 were more likely to be judged unsafe on 6-month follow-up on-road driving test s than drivers with a CDR of 0 (RR 2.68 vs. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 59 (1.4, 4.8); N S for CDR of 0.5 vs. 0 and CDR 1 vs. 0.5). In the third study (Grace, 2005), the RR for unsafe driving of drivers with CDR of 0.5 or 1 vs. CDR 0 was 25 (1.5 - 384). A substantial percentage (45%) of CD R 0.5-1 drivers passed the test. Comment: Individuals with CDR of 0.5-1 shoul d probably be considered to be at higher risk for failing an on-road driving test (RR range 9.67 - 88.67). T hose with CDR of 1 are at a slightly higher risk than those with CDR 0.5. However, CDR of 0.5-1 patients should probably not be categorically considered to be unsafe, as a s ubstantial percentage ( 41% - 67%) can still pass an on-road driving test. Patie nts with a CDR of 1 should possi bly be reconsidered for re- evaluation for driving compet ence at 6-month intervals. 3. Neuropsychological75 Prediction of Driving Safety Evidence is summarized by cognitive domain as in Lezak (2004) and Strauss, Sherman and Spreen (2006) and for different diseases becau se different neuropsychol ogical tests may have differential predictive validity fo r different types of dementia7. a) Attention and Concentration Alzheimer's disease 12 UFOV: The Useful Field of View232 test depends on speed of processing and attention subtests. Uc et al., 2004 reported that the tota l UFOV score (sum of the four UFOV subtests) correlated significantly with inco rrect turns (r = .42), times lost (r = .23), and at-fault safety errors (r = .25) on a road test (Class 1). UFOV total score was associated with incorrect turns in several adjusted and unadjusted regression analyses. Rizzo et al ., (1997) reported that UFOV total loss greater than 50 percent predicte d crashes during a simula ted driving scenario (OR = 18.13, CI = 2.34, ). The association was no longer si gnificant in a stepwise logistic regression with other tests. In a Class 2 st udy (Uc et al, 2006) UFOV was associated with abrupt slowing (OR = 1.20, CI = 1.05, 1.37), but not crash or risky beha vior, or premature stopping (Class 2). The association with abrupt slowing remained signi ficant after adjusting for diagnosis. UFOV total loss > 50 percent was not associated with cr ash in another Class 2 study of simulated driving (Rizzo et al., 2001). Trails A26: Trails A was evaluated in 4 Class 2 studies. Of the three studies that examined ro ad test outcomes, one reported a difference in Trails A scores between safe and unsafe drivers with AD13 (mean+SD = 41.22+17.29 and 106.63+56.09 for safe and unsafe, respectively) (G race, 2005), and one reported a significant correlation between Trails A and a pass-fail ro ad test outcome among control subjects and participants with AD ( = .344, p = .02) (Hunt et al., 1993). Th e third road test study reported no significant relationship (Fox, 1997). A simulator study (Uc et al., 2006) reported an association between Trails A and abrupt slowing (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01, 1.04), but not two other driving outcomes. Digit Symbol: Two Class 2 studies reported conflicting results. The first reported a significant correlation between this cognitive test and a pass-fail driving outcome among adults with AD13 and healthy older controls (r = -.39, p = .007; Hunt et al., 1993). However, another study found no correlation between Digit Symbol performance and a total driving score or a pass-fail driving outcome among subjects with probable AD (Fox et al., 1997). Digit Span: Rizzo et al., (1997) suggested that an age-corrected score <10 (forward plus backward) predicted simulated car crashe s among subjects with AD a nd controls without dementia7 (OR = 10.04, CI = 1.31, ). A Class 2 study, by the same team , failed to replicate this finding when Digit Span was used to predict simu lated intersection crashes (OR = 6.58, CI = .60, 354.77; Rizzo et al., 2001). Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 60 Parkinson's disease58 Trails A26: Non-demented patients with mild to moderate PD64 completed a neuropsychological75 battery, including Trails A and a standardized road test (Grace, 2005). There was no difference between safe and unsafe drivers with PD on Trails A (Class 2). In a second Class 2 study (Stolwyk et al., 2006), Trails A correlated with only one of six simulated driving outcome measures (meter s traveled past traffic signals ) among 18 participants with PD (r = .49, p<.05). Choice reaction time: One study failed to detect a relatio nship between a choice reaction time test and simulated driving outcomes (Stolwyk et al., 2006). In a second study, correct responses on a choice reaction time test correlat ed with number of road test faults (r = -.56, p<.01), but not number of road test offenses in a sample of patients with PD (Heikkila et al., 1998; Class 3). Decision time on the task correlate d with both faults and offenses, but choice reaction time was not an independent predictor of road test errors. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task146 (PASAT147): (Radford et al, 2004, Class 2), found no relationship between the PASA T and road test performance. In a second study, PASAT correlated with road test speed (r = .32, p = .01) and speed variability (r = -.27, p = .03) among mild to moderate PD patients (Uc et al ., 2006; Class 1). However, PASAT was not a significant independent predicto r of driving performance. Dementia7/Suspected Dementia Several studies examined samples that combined patients with several types of dementia, or did not describe or assess speci fic diagnoses in groups with suspected dementia. Since this data may supplement research reviewed above for specific diagnostic groups, all relevant studies are described. Trails A: In a Class 2 driving simulator study (Szlyk et al., 2002), Trails A correlated with lane boundary crossing (r = .73, p = .0001), Speed (r = -.57, p = .009), and brake pedal pressure, calculated as the SD of pressure during the session (r = -.61, p = .01; Class 2). In a Class 3 study of patients with mild dementia (C DR = 0.5), Trails A did not correlate the road test score (Class 3). In anot her Class 3 study of older and dementia patients (Odenheimer et al, 1994), Trails A correlated with the in-traffic road test score in the whole sample (r = .52, p < .01; age adjusted, r = .33, p < .05). In a battery of tests used to predict fitness to drive (based on a road test), Trails A made a signi ficant contribution to the model (p = .005; de Raedt et al., 2001a) and the test battery's combined test score of 24 out of 30 (including Trails A, MMSE 28, the Clock Test, age, and visual acuity) demonstrated a sensitivity of .80 and a specificity of .85. Other tests: Complex reaction time also correlated w ith in-traffic score in a Class 2 study (Odenheimer et al., 1994; r = -.70, p < .01; r = -. 58, p < .01), while simple reaction time did not correlate. UFOV233 and Letter Cancellation were examined by Whelihan et al., (2005; Class 2). All three UFOV subtests administered correlated with the ro ad test score in the patient group (r's .46 to .61, p's < .05). There was no relationship between Letter Cancellation and the road test score. A Cl ass 1 study examined the Sternberg Test, an adapted version of the Mackworth clock, and a visual tracking test in relation to a road test in several dementia7 and control groups (Fitten et al., 1995) . Drive score correlated with the Sternberg (r = .71) and Mackworth clock (r = -.52) tests. In a stepwise multiple regression, the Sternberg test, visual track ing and one other test (MMSE28) best correlated with drive Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 61 score. In a Class 2 sim ulator study (Szylk, 2002), Digit Span correlated with brake pedal pressure (r = .48, p = .04), but not lane boundary crossing or spee d. Digit Symbol correlated with lane boundary crossing (r = -.47, p = .03), bu t not the other two driving outcomes. In a Class 3 study (Cushman, 1992), low scores on a sustained attention task (vigilance) discriminated between drivers who met or failed a road test (t = -3.26, p =.008). b) Executive Functioning Alzheimer's disease12 Trails B26: Trails B was administered in two Class 1 studies and four Class 2 studies that included subjects with Alzheimer's disease. All but one Class 2 study (Fox, 1997) reported a significant association between Trails B perfor mance and driving outcomes. Rizzo et al (1997) found an association between impaired Tr ails performance (scaled score equivalent < 3; < 1 percentile) and crashes durin g simulated driving (OR = 30.19, CI = 3.81, ). Uc et al., (2004) reported significant co rrelations between Trails B performance and both incorrect turns (r = .27, p < .001) and at-fault safety erro rs (r = .19, p = .01) on a road test (Class 1). Neither study identified Trails B as a significant predictor in stepwise logistic regressions. In Class 2 studies, Trails B discriminated be tween safe and unsafe drivers on a road test (184.55+94.00 and 289.91+24.42 sec respectively) (Grace, 2005), predicted simulated driving crashes (Trails B scaled score equivalent <3, < 1st percentile; OR = 13.47, CI = 1.19, 747.68) (Rizzo et al., 2001), and predicted abrupt slowing (OR = 1.31, CI = 1.12, 1.54), premature slowing (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.02, 1.35), and crash or risky behavior (OR = 1.22, CI = 1.01, 1.46) during simulated driving (Uc, 2006). However, in the latter study, these tests demonstrated no additive pred ictive value beyond diagnosis. Controlled Oral Word Association 148 (COWA149): Two Class 1 studies and three Class 2 studies examined the COWA. Scores less than 30 (corrected for age and education) were a ssociated with crashes during simulated driving (OR = 24.56, CI = 2.16, 1373.29; Class 1; Rizzo, 1997). Results were mixed in a second Class 1 study; COWA co rrelated with incorrect turns on a road test (r = -0.21, p = .005), but not times lost or at-fault errors (Uc, 2006). Evidence was also mixed in Class 2 studies. Rizzo et al. reported a signi ficant association with crashes during simulated driving (COWA < 30; OR = 41.68, CI = 3.02, 2716.06), but Uc et al (20 06) did not find an association with road test outcomes. Parkinson's disease58 Trails B26: Four Class 2 studies examined executive functioning with Trails B, and all reported significant associations with driving performance. Trails B discriminated between safe and unsafe drivers with PD64 (142.55+79.88 and 214.57+89.14 sec, respectively) (Grace, 2005; Class 2), and Trails B pe rformance correlated with four of six simulated driving outcomes in a second study (r's = -.44 to -.50) (Stolwyk et al., 2006). Trails B scores (adjusted for Trails A) correlated with road te st speed (r = -.35, p = .005), speed variability (r = .37, p = .003), and steering variability (r = -.28, p = .03) among mild to moderate PD patients (Uc et al., 2006). An additional st udy also demonstrated a correlation between simulated driving performance and Trails B (r = .48; p<0.01) (Zesiewicz et al., 2002). Stroop: In one Class 2 study Stroop interference scores did not differentiate between safe and unsafe drivers with PD (Radford, 2004). Suspected/Other Dementia7 In one Class 2 study of patient s with Huntington's disease150 (Rebok et al., 1995), scores on the Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test151 (WCST152), and Trails B did not correlate with simulated driving performance. One Class 1 study (Cushman, 1992), two Class 2 studies Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 62 (Szlyk, 2002 ; Whelihan, 2005) provided additional support for Trails B. Similarly mazes were supported in one Class 2 study and one Class 3 study. Maze navigation time correlated with road test performance (r = .52, p < .01) but not maze errors in a second study (Class 2; Whelihan, 2005). Maze errors (OR = 15.51, P < .001) and maze completion time (OR = 5.87, p <.01) were both associated with road test pa ss-fail scores. In one Class 3 study, there was a significant difference between dementia patie nts with and without crashes on Category Naming (Lucas-Blaustein, 1988). Alzheimer's disease12 Line Orientation135: Judgment of line orientation was examin ed in two Class 2 articles. Uc et al. found that line orientati on correlated significantly with landmark and traffic sign identification (r= 0.25; p=0.0009) Rebok et al . found that line orientation correlated significantly with hazard reaction time(r= 0.23). Block Design137: Block design was examined in two Cla ss 2 articles. Uc et al. found that block design correlated significantly landmark and traffic sign identification (r=0.4; p<0.0001) and at fault safety errors (r= -0.24; p=0.0022). Rizzo et al. found that block design with simulator performance (OR= 40.78; CI= 3.29, Benton Visual Retention Test 138 (BVRT139): The BVRT was examined in one Class 1 article. Hunt (1993) found that BVRT-Copy (Form D) (mean 9.2, SD = 1.5) correlated significantly with a pass -fail road test (r= -0.42; p=0.008). Complex Figure Test140 (CFT141): CFT was examined in two Class 2 articles. Rizzo et al. found that CFT copy was associated with simulator performance (OR= 57.61; CI= 6.88, ; p<0.001). Rizzo et al. found that CFT copy (<20) was Parkinson's Class 2 article (S tolwyk et al., 2006) block design correlated with traffic signal approach speed (r= -0.502; p< 0.05), mean curve speed (r= 0.556; of within curve lane position Line Orientation135: Judgment of Line Orientation deceleration signal stop point (r= - 0.628; p<0.01), curve direction effect on mean lane position (r= 0.373), and variability of within curve lane position (-0.336) (Stolwyk et al., 2006). Picture Completion: P icture completion correlated with traffic signal stop point (r= -0.502; p<0.05), curve direction effect on mean lane pos ition (r= 0.284), and variability of within curve p<0.05) (Stolwyk et al., 2006). Dementia7 Block Design: I one Class 2 article (Szlyk et al., 2002) Block Design correlated with lane boundary crossing (r= -0.48; p<0.05) and speed (r= 0.469; visual memory test- revised153 (BVMT-R154) was found to correlate significantly for the delayed r ecall (r= -0.28), but the BVMT-R total score did not (Whelihan et al., 2005; Class 2). Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 63 c) Memory Alzheimer's disease12 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test155 (AVLT156): In a Class 2 article (Uc et al., 2005) AVLT- recall correlated significantly with landmark and traffi c sign identification (r= 0.50; p<0.0001) e rrors (r= -0.28; p<0.0002). BVRT139 was examined in one Class 1 article and three Cla ss 2 articles. Hunt, (1993) found that BVRT- recall (form C) correlated significantly with pass/ fail on a driving test (r= -0. 43; p=0.003; Class 1). Rizzo et al., 2001 found that low scores on the BVRT (n umber correct <4) were associated with simulator performance (OR= 1.95; CI= 0.21, 18.18; Class 2). Rizzo et al., 1997 found that BVRT- correct was associated with simulator performance (OR= 12.3; CI= 1.41, ; p=0.01; Class 2. Facial Recognition142: Facial recognition was examined in tw o Class 2 articles. Rizzo et al., 1997 found that facial recognition was associated with car crashes in a driving simulator (OR= 58.53; CI= 4.32, 3784.18; p<0.001).Rizzo et al., 2001 found that facial recognition was associated with simulator performance (O R= 1.24; CI= 0.09, 11.74). Logical memory was examined in one Class 1 and one Class 2 articl es. Hunt, (1993) found that logical memory in AD13 (mean 6.7+4.8) correlated significantly with pass-fail road test performance (r= -0.47; p=0.0009; Class 1). Rebok et al., 1994 found that immediate logical memory (mean in AD = 7.8+5.4] correlated significantly with a driving performance test measuring reaction to hazards (r= 0.32; Class 2). Visual reproduction: One Class 2 article (Rebok et al ., 1994) found that immediate visual reproduction in AD (mean =14+9.4) correlated signi ficantly with a driving performance test measuring reaction to hazards (r= 0.28). Parkinson's disease58 AVLT was examined in one Class 2 article. Uc et al., 2006 found that AVLT correlated significantly with speed vari ability (r= -0.31; Dementia7 Logical Memory: A Class 2 article (Szlyk et al., 2002) found that Logical Memory I correlated significantly with simulator performance, specifically, with lane boundary crossing (r= -0.59; p<0.01) and brake pedal pressure (r= 0.66; p<0.01). Szlyk et al. also found that logical memory II correlated significantly with speed (r= 0.50; p<0.05) and brake pedal pressure (r= 0.55; p<0.05) in the same simulator task. Visual memory was examined in one Class 2 and one ungraded (as of now) article. Sl eek et al. (2002) found that visual memory I correlated significantly with lane boundary crossing (r= 0.50) in a simulator task. Odenheimer et al. (1994) found that visual memo ry correlated significantly with anon- traffic driving score (r= Comments: Tests of attention, ex ecutive functioning, visuospatial134 skills, and memory are useful to assist in assessments of drivers with Alzheimer's disease12. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Trails B26, UFOV233, Line Orientation135, Block Design137, BVRT-Copy139 and BVRT-Recall, CFT-Copy141, Facial Recognition142, and Logical Memory in assessments of drivers with Alzheimer's di sease. For patients with Parkinson's disease58, there is sufficient evidence to recommend te sts of executive functioning, and visuospatial skills for use in driving assessments. There was also evidence to recommend the use of Trails B. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 64 4. Demographic Factors and Driving Risk (a) Gender After age 25, men crash about 20 to 30 percen t more often than wo men, but women have crash rates per mile driven about 20 to 30 pe rcent higher than men (Janke, 2003, Ryan, 1998). After 65, four Class 3 studies (Stamatiadis, 1995, 1996; Ha kamies-Blomqvist, 1994; Kim, 1998) report women to have a 7.9 percent (Sta matiadis, 1996) to 47 percent (Kim, 1998) higher overall, nonmileage adjusted risk for at-fau lt crashes than men. In one of these studies (Kim, 1998) (n=69,077), women over 70 were the highe st risk group for at-fault crashes. A smaller Class 3 study (Ball, 2005) reported lower odds for wo men being at-fault (OR=0.59). Comment: There are no clear indications fo r increased risk related to gender. (b) Living Status A single Class 3 study (Lefrancoi s, 1997) reported a higher adjust ed OR (2.22) for a crash in older people living alone. Comment: The evidence is limited. (c) Driver and caregiver assessment of driving competence and risk. Patients who rate themselves as \"poor\" or \"fai r\" drivers have usually begun to restrict their driving or have stopped entirely (Hakamies-Bl omqvist, 1998). Those w ho continue to drive with restrictions have a fivefold increase d risk of crashes (C lass 2) (Lesikar, 2002). Most who continue to drive rate themselves as \"safe\" drivers, yet their ratings correlate poorly with actual driving performance (Marottoli, 1998). In a Class 1 study of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease12 (AD13) (CDR133 0.5 to 1) (Brown, 2005b), 94 percent of patients rated themselves as \"safe,\" but only 41 percen t passed an on-road driving test. This is a specificity of 10.7 percent for self-rating as \"safe.\" In another Class 1 study of patients with mild AD (Hunt, 1993), all patie nts who failed the on-road driving test considered themselves to be safe drivers. A third Class 1 study of patients with mild AD (Wild, 2003) also reported signifi cant discrepancies between self -rating as \"safe\" and on-road driving test performance. Ca regiver ratings correlate modest ly with on-road driving test performance. A Class 1 study of mild AD patients (Brown, 2005b) reported figures that calculate to a sensitivity of 53 percent and spec ificity of 71 percent fo r caregiver ratings of \"marginal\" or \"unsafe.\" A caregiver rating of \"safe\" had a sensitivity of 81.8 percent and a specificity of 47.8 percent. A second Class 1 study of mild AD patients (Wild, 2003) reported that, while there was no significant differen ce between informant ratings and patient performance in most categories of an on-road driving test, informants overrated performance in nearly every category. Comment: There is a poor correlation between a self-rating of \"safe\" and on-road driving test performance (three Class 1 st udies). One Class 2 study re ported a higher incidence of crashes in patients with low se lf-ratings. One Class 1 study repor ted that an informant rating of marginal or unsafe more accurately predicts on-road driving test performance than a rating of \"safe.\" In a second Class 1 study, informants ' ratings were generall y higher than those of the driving instructor, but were not significantly different. Clinicians should not consider a patient or informant rating of \"s afe\" to accurately reflect driving competence. An informant's rating of \"marginal\" or \"unsaf e\" should be considered to be more reliable (but still Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 65 insensitive) than a rating of \"s afe.\" A self-rating of \"poor\" or \"fair\" probably indicates a higher risk for crashes. (d) Driving history asso ciated with driving competence or risk Traffic Citations Among all elements of the driving history, violati ons are the best predictor of future crashes (Janke, 2003; Gebers, 1992). After 80, 60 percen t of citations are for disregarding traffic signs, improper signaling, or failure to yield (Janke, 2003). In elders, citations are moderately correlated with cognitive impairment (r = 0.4-0.5; McKnight, 1999). Drivers 60 to 69 showed an increase in the RR for a crash of 0.77 per traffic citation; for drivers over 70, the RR was 0.54 per citation (Gebers, 1992). For dr ivers over 70, two or mo re convictions result in RR of a motor vehicle crash that exceeds that of any other age group. A Class 1 study (Keall, 2004) of all New Zeal and drivers over 80 (n = 39, 318) reported that, among patients with traffic citations in the two years prior to the study, the adjusted OR for a subsequent injury crash in the following two years was 2.16 (95% CI 1.10-4.21, p = 0.025). The logistic regression model us ed in this study reported a st rong correlation between prior infractions and subsequent crashes (r = 0.768, p = 0.025). Another large Class 1 study of drivers over 65 (n = 426, 408) (D aignault, 2002a) also reported a significant but much weaker correlation between prior convictions in the firs t three years of the study and State reported crashes in the following three years ( = 0.062 for 65 through 69, 0.088 for age > 80; p < 0.0001). Using an on-road driving test as the outcome measur ement, one Class 2 (DiStefano, 2003) and one Class 3 (McKnight, 1999) study of ol der drivers reported previous convictions to be modestly correlated with failing or scoring lower on the on-road driving test. Comment: Reported violations are relatively uncommon in older dr ivers and are predictive of increased driving risk (three Class 1, one Cla ss 2, and one Class 3 study). Because of the correlation between previous vi olations and poor performance on a driving test or future crashes in drivers over 65, clin icians should obtain a history of traffic violations or other officially reported incidents from a reliable in formant. Previous violations, especially multiple violations, are strongly correl ated with increased driving risk. Crashes In older drivers, previous cras hes are strongly correlated with deficits in executive functions, (Daigneault, 2002b) visuospatial 134, and psychomotor capabilities (Lundberg, 1998). Two Class 2 studies reported an association be tween previous accidents and decreased competence. One study of drivers over 65 (DeR aedt, 2000a) reported a si gnificant correlation between self-reported accidents and lower on -road driving test scores (r = 0.29, p<.007). Cutoff scores for failing the on-road driving te st were not provided. Since self-reported crashes are usually underreported, the correlation with all crashe s is probably stronger. A large Class 2 study of drivers over 65 (Dai gneault, 2002a, n = 426, 408) reported significant correlations between all reported crashes in the first three year s of the study and subsequent crashes in the recent three years (regressi on coefficient B range 0.092 to 0.771, p<0.0001). Since cognitive status was not reported, it is unknown to what degr ee this correlation is independent of cognitive status. A Class 1 double cohort study of patients with mild dementia 7 and controls (Fitten, 1995) reported a significant correlation, with all groups combined, between the combination of reporte d collisions and moving violations per mile driven and lower on-road driving test scores (r = 0.38, p<.02). A history of previous crashes Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 66 portends a higher risk of future crashes than does the presence of m ild dementia alone. A Class 1 study of drivers 55 to 87 (Owsley, 1998) repor ted that the relative risk of any crash in the last three years of the study was higher for th ose with a history of a motor vehicle crash in the previous five years (RR 2.0, 95% C1 1.06 to 3.79, p = .03) than for those with cognitive impairment, as defined by a Mattis Organic Mental Syndrome Screening Examination157 (MOMSSE158) score of greater than 9 (RR 1.17, 95 % CI 0.61 to 2.27, p = .63). A Class 2 study of drivers over 65 (McGwin, 2000) reported that the OR for an at-fault motor vehicle crash in the final year of the study was higher for drivers with one or more at-fault crashes in the first four years of the study (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.0) than for drivers with cognitive impairment, defined as three or more erro rs on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire 159 (SPMSQ160) (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.4). A third Class 2 study of drivers over 65 (Foley, 1 995) reported that the OR for a future crash was higher for drivers with a crash in the prev ious two years (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7) than it was for drivers with mild cognitive impairment , defined as more than two errors on the SPMSQ (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.2). The circumstan ces of a crash differ with age. For older drivers, crashes most often result from the improper execution of a turn (Ryan, 1998, Andre, 1999). For drivers over 70, a Cla ss 2 study (Preussner, 1998) reporte d that failure to yield at an intersection results in a RR for a crash of 2.94, increasing to 10.62 by 85. In a Class 3 study (Chandraratna, 2003), drivers over 65 had < OR of 1.98 (1.82 to 2.17) for an at-fault crash while turning left at an intersecti on; above 85, the OR was 8.20 (6.43 to 10.46). Crossing a road had an OR of 1.25 at 65 and 4.44 at 85; unsafe lane changes had an OR of 1.11 at 65 and 4.41 at 85. Comment: The history of a motor vehi cle crash in the previous one to five years is likely to be predictive of reduced driving competence in older patients or patients with dementia 7, as measured by future crashes or on-road driving te st performance (one Class 1 and four Class 2 studies). In patients with dementia, one Class 1 study reports an associ ation between previous violations and crashes (combined) and poor perf ormance on an on road driving test. The risk of a motor vehicle crash in th e one to three years following as sessment is probably two times higher in older patients with a history of a previous motor vehicl e crash than in patients with mild dementia alone (one Class 1 and two Class 2 studies). Crashes at in tersections appear to be a particular problem. In older patients a nd in patients with mild dementia, clinicians should consider obtaining a corrobo rated history of crashes, as previous crashes are correlated with reduced driving competence. Reduced Mileage Drivers over 60 begin to reduce their annual driving mileage by about 20 to 30 percent per decade of life, with drivers above 85 averaging 75 miles per week (Dellinger, 2001a). People more likely to reduce their driving exposure include females (Charlton, 2003; Lyman, 2001; Margolis, 2002; Vance, 2006) and those w ith visual impairment (Lyman, 2001; McGwin, 2000; Stutts, 1998) or functional disability (Campbell, 1993; Maratt oli, 1993). These variables were controlled for in all studies cited in this analysis. Patients with mild dementia, as a group, drive less than their age-matched cont rols (Table 1). Reductions in mileage begin at the earliest stages of dementia, assumedly b ecause the patient or caregiver has evidence or concerns of declining competence. The weight ed median weekly mileage is 63.3 for patients with very mild dementia versus 149.9 for cont rols. Two Class 2 studies (Lyman, 2002; Stutts, 1998) using a cutoff of 3,000 miles per year, or 57 miles per week, also reported that restricted driving was more fr equent in cognitively impaired patients (OR's range 1.5 to 3.41). Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 67 Decreased exposure itself is not only a surrogate m arker for dementia, but represents an independent risk factor for decreased co mpetence. A Class 1 mixed population study (Cushman 96) of people over 55 and patients with mild AD13 reported that the mean weekly mileage of the group failing the on-road driv ing test was 64.6 (SD 51) versus 210 (SD 165) for the passing group (t = -7.22, p< .001). Becau se the passing and failing groups also had significant differences in cognitive status, mileage and multiple cognitive test scores were added into a stepwise logistic re gression model to predict failure of the on-road driving test. Annual mileage emerged as the only significant predictor of failure (c hi square = 12.84, p = .0003). A Class 2 study of drivers over 65 reported for unsafe driv ing (DeRaedt, 2000b) excluded patients with a previous diagnosis of dementia, but included people who were subsequently found in the study to have sign ificant cognitive impairment. Using linear regression analysis, reduced mileage was not significantly correlated with MMSE 28 score (r = .26, p>.12), but was moderately correlated with worse scores on the on-road driving test (Standardized Beta = 0.281, t = 3.185, p = .002, r = 0.334). One Class 3 study of drivers over 65 reported significant differences in driving exposure, but no t MMSE scores, between crash- involved and noncrash-involved drivers (MacGregor, 2001). The apparently independent correlation betw een reduced exposure and reduced competence may reflect the deterioration of a skill (driving) that requires practice, or may indicate that reduced exposure is actually a surrogate for dementia 7 severity that is not detected within standard global measures. In either cas e, reduced exposure emerges beyond standard measures of dementia as an independent predictor of reduced driving competence. Comment: Patients with mild dementia signifi cantly reduce their drivi ng exposure, with an average exposure of about 60 to 80 miles per week (two Class 2 and four Class 3 studies). In older drivers and drivers with mild dementia, there are significant and independent correlations between reduced exposure and poor pe rformance on an on road driving test (one Class 1, one Class 2, and one Cla ss 3 study). Clinicians addressi ng driving risk in the older people and in patients with dementia should consider obtaining information on driving exposure. Whether reported mileag e rates are accura te is unclear. Situation Avoidance Avoidance of particular driving s ituations, such as driving at night , is associated with some of the same factors as described for reduced mil eage\u2014increased age, female gender (Charlton), visual problems, declining health status (Baldock, 2006; Anstey, 2005), previous crashes (Daignaeault, 2002b, Ball, 1998), and awareness of cognitive deficits (Cotrell and Wild, 1999). Two Class 1 (Vance, 2006, Baldock, 2006) and three Class 2 studies (Ball, 1998, Staplin, 2003; Stutts, 1998) of olde r drivers have reported significant, modest correlations (r = 0.2-0.4) between avoidance of driv ing at night, in the rain, or in heavy traffic, and deficits in visual attention (Baldock, 2006b, Ball, 1998), concentration, and executive function (Staplin, 2003, Stutts, 1998, Vance, 2006). Drivi ng avoidance may be a surrogate marker for these types of cognitive deficits that are correla ted with reduced driving competence. A Class 1 mixed-population study of drivers over 60 and medically referred drivers (Baldock, 2006a) found correlations between self-reported avoidanc e of driving in the rain or at night and failing an on-road driving test (r = 0.33 to 0.35, p<.01). Cognitive testing was not performed. In a Class 2 study (Lesikar, 2002), drivers who re ported changing their driving habits because of safety concerns had a RR of 5.3 (95% CI 0.63 to 44.63) of a crash in the following two years. Driving avoidance is not a completely reliable surrogate for reduced competence, Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 68 however. In a Class 1 study (Baldock, 2006b) mo st drivers reported that they \"never\" avoided dif ficult situations, even those w ith deficits in visual contrast sensitivity25, processing speed, and visuospatial134 memory that were severe enough to result in failing an on-road driving test. In a Class 2 study of older and medically re ferred drivers (Staplin, 2003), those with substantial cognitive impairment were just as likely to report that they \"never\" avoided difficult situations as always. Thus, while avoidance is correlated with cognitive deficits and reduced driving competence, the lack of avoidance does not indicate competence. Comment: There are significant, modest correl ations between avoidance of difficult driving situations and cognitive impairment (two Class 1 and three Class 2 studies). There is also a correlation between avoidance and future crashes or failing an on-road driving test (one Class 1 and one Class 2 study). However, cognitively impaired patients are equally likely never to avoid difficult situations (one Class 1 and one Class 2 study). Clin icians should obtain a history of avoidance of driving at night, in th e rain, or in heavy traffic. Patients who report \"always\" avoiding these situations are at higher risk for cogniti ve impairment that correlates with reduced driving competence. The reportin g of \"never\" avoiding these situations should probably be disregarded, as there is no correlation with competence. Other Driving Habits Across all age groups, violations and crashes ar e associated with aggressive or impulsive behaviors, such as willful disreg ard of traffic laws or expressed anger at other drivers (Parker, 1995; Simon, 1996; Noyes, 1985). In patien ts with mild to moderate dementia 7 (mean MMSE28 = 21.9), a Class 1 study (Herrmann, 2006) reported that agita tion and aggression were predictive of a refusal to discontinue driving (HR for driving cessation = 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90). In a Class 2 study (L esikar, 2002); self-repo rted anger or frustration with other drivers was associated with a higher risk of future crashes. Comment: Clinicians should consider aggressive or impulsive personality characteristics to be associated with increased driving risk. (e) Interventions to reduce driving risk. Programs to educate elders about at-risk mane uvers have had variable success. A Class 1 randomized controlled trial161 (RCT162) of drivers over 55 (Bedard, 2004), reported no significant difference in on-road dr iving test scores between drivers randomized to a driver's education program and a control group. In another Class 1 RCT of visually impaired, cognitively unimpaired, crash-involved driv ers over 60 (Owsley, 2003), drivers were randomized to a control group or a driver educ ation program that id entified potentially hazardous driving situations (e.g., left turns acr oss traffic, driving al one) and interventions (e.g., make three right turns around the block, us e a copilot). By se lf-report, the driver education group significantly reduced their overa ll driving exposure to hazardous situations. In a Class 2 study of crash-invol ved, visually impaired drivers with a MMSE of greater than 23 (Stalvey, 2003), those randomized to an e ducational program re ported a significantly increased awareness of visual impairment and a n eed to self-regulate thei r driving. In a Class 3 study of drivers over 59 asked to maintain a daily driving diary for 30 days (Kiernan, 1999), there were significant decreases in self reporte d dangerous events by the end of the reporting period. In another Class 3 study, (Marshall, 200 5) the on-road drivi ng test scores of 628 subjects were analyzed. Of 11 driving elem ents, cognitive ones (a nticipating hazards, observing pedestrians, having proper stopping pos ition) are more predictive of passing or failing an on-road driving test and should be considered as a component of driving assessment Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 69 program s. In a Class 3 study of referral a nd reassessment procedures in 20 people with dementia (Lovell, 2005), routine referral and reassessm ent after six months were found to be appropriate. Comment: Clinicians may consider referring older drivers with visual impairment for a targeted education program. Safety benefits of education programs for older drivers or drivers with dementia are unproven. In-Person License Renewal or Restricted Licenses In a Class 2 study of all-aged drivers (Mayhall , 2002), the application of driving and licensing restrictions to at-risk drivers resulted in a reduced crash rate of 12.8 percent (2.4 to 23.2%) and a reduced violation rate of 10 percent (4.4 to 15.7%). In drivers over age 70, two Class 2 studies have reported conflicting results: one (Levy, 1995) reported a slightly lower risk of a fatal crash in States w ith mandated visual acuity 5 tests (RR 0.93; 0.89 to 0.97); the second study (Grabowski, 2004) reported no differen ce except for mandated in-person license renewal for drivers over 85 (f atal crash RR 0.83, 0.72 to 0.96). Comment: None. Summary: Because age and medical diagnosis alone are ofte n unreliable criteria for licensure, decisions on fitness to drive should be based on empiri cal observations of performance. There is variability in the psychometric support for variou s driving tests, and debate remains regarding the \"Gold Standard\" for driving ability. State road tests provide qualitative assessments of driving behavior, and are often considered the determinant of driver competence. However they are typically designed to test if novice drivers know and can apply the rules of the road, not to predict crash involvement in skilled drivers who may now be impaired. They are rarely able to evaluate driving competen ce in unsafe or emergency conditions. State-recorded at-fault crash data are a reasonable surroga te measurement of unsafe driving. However, crashes are sporadic, uncontrolled events during which few objectives observations can be made. Personal accounts and State cras h records may be incomplete, and crashes are under-reported. Crash data are somewhat inse nsitive, because not all certifiably unsafe drivers have had a crash and nonspecific because not all drivers with an at-fault crash are unsafe drivers. Crash data that do not include an at fault determination are even less sensitive and specific. Self-reported at-fault crashes ar e underreported relative to caregiver-reported crashes and State-recorded crashes. Driv ing simulator studies permit qualitative and quantitative assessments and can evaluate dr iving behavior in (simulated) dangerous circumstances, but have varying degrees of standardization and \"ecological validity.\" Current evidence shows se veral potentially useful clinical associations between a specific cognitive test and driving outcome, although cut- points for safe-unsafe driving often vary between studies or are not provided. In the abse nce of clear cutoffs, cognitive test scores in the range of moderate dementia 7 may be construed to raise th e same level of concern as a CDR133 of 1 (moderate dementia). Tests of attention, executiv e functioning, visuospatial 134 skills, and memory are useful to assist in assessments of driv ers with Alzheimer's disease12. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Trails B26 , UFOV233, Line Orientation135, Block Design137, 70 Copy139 and BVRT-Recall, CFT-Copy141, Facial Recognition142, and Logical Memory in assessments of drivers with Alzheimer's diseas e. For patients with Parkinson's disease58, there is sufficient evidence to recommend te sts of executive functioning, and visuospatial skills for use in driving assessments. There was also evidence to recommend the use of Trails B. Potential sources of error and bias in th ese studies must be considered. Many studies report univariate analyses. As many cognitive tests are inter-correlated, it is unclear in these reports whether significant findings represent unique strengths of a specific test, or if other inter-correlated tests better predict a driving outcome. Similarly, when st udies included control subjects, most did not adjust analyses for diagnosis. In these studies , it is not possible to determine predictive value (\"added value\") of tests beyond diagnosis . The very diagnosis of dementia7 depends on cognitive tests. Another issue is whether to use raw or transformed (scaled) neuropsychological 75 test scores in predictions of driver safety. Neuropsychological test scores are often corrected (e.g., scaled for age, education or gender) to improve ability to detect deviations from normative reference groups. Yet, it can be argued that what matters on the road is pure ab ility, regardless of demographic characteristics. For instance, if a driver exhibits slowed processing speed, it matters that they are slow compar ed to all other drivers, not just compared to other drivers in the same demographic group. Consequentl y, efforts to relate neuropsychological performance with driving perfor mance and to generate predicti ons of safety in individual older drivers at risk for dementia should consid er using raw scores. Evidence suggests that individuals over 70 years are at critical risk for developing age-related cognitive deficits. Raw neuropsychological test scores across this group of older dr ivers will have largely the same meaning for driving, and the number who sc reen positive for unsafe driving will tend to increase with age. For instance, a raw score of 212 for Trails B 26 will screen positive (unsafe) in 5 percent of 70-year-olds and in 16 percent of all 81-year-olds. Different clinical approaches and judgments are needed for younger patients in whom test scores have different implica tions: a 55-year-old who performs like an average 80-year-old on neuropsychological tests may well have significant brain disease. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 71 Chapter 4: Medical Conditions Diabetes In diabetes15 the body does not produce enough insulin29 or properly use it, resulting in elevated blood glucose163. Genetics, obesity, and inactivity are factors. Over 20 million children and adults in the United States are estim ated to have the dis ease. Many individuals with diabetes are unaware that they have it. Most people with diabetes are adults who have type 2 diabetes164 due to insulin deficiency and resistance. A minority (<10 percent) have type 1 diabetes165 due to failure of the pancreas to produce insulin. In pre-diabetes166, blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to diagnose diabetes. Other causes of high blood glucose incl ude gestational diabetes167, steroid medications, and pancreatitis168. Treatments for diabetes incl ude oral hypoglycemic agents169 and injected insulin. Oral hypoglycemic drugs slow down absorption of suga rs from the gut, decrease glucose release from the liver, increase glucose uptake by fat and mu scle cells, or have a combination of actions such as appetite re duction, increased prod uction of insulin, and decreased glucose release from the liver. Standard human insuli n begins to act within 30 to 60 minutes of injection, achieves peak effect in 2 to 3 hours, and acts for 6 to 8 hours wh en injected into the abdomen at a dosage of 0.1 to 0.2 U/kg. Duratio n of action is prolonged when a larger dose of regular insulin is injected into the thigh or hip. Short-acting insulin has more abrupt effects on blood glucose levels. Diabetes can result in high blood suga r producing frequent urination (polyuria 170), extreme thirst (polydipsia171), weight loss, fatigue, irritabili ty, and blurred vision. Treatment of diabetes with diet, oral hypoglycemic agents, and particularly insulin to reduce blood sugar may result in acute hypoglycemia14, with confusion, coma, and even death. Chronic complications of diabetes include heart and bl ood vessel disease, stroke (large and small blood vessel), visual loss due to retinopathy98 and hemorrhages172, foot ulcers, infections, neuropathy173, joint deformities (Charcot joints), pa in, and kidney disease or failure (and effects of dialysis). (For more information on diabetic retinopathy see page 53). Some patients require kidney transplants and take immune therapy. People with diabetes tend to have risk factors for heart disease in cluding obesity, high blood pressure, and atheros clerosis174. Drugs that lower blood pressure a nd cardiac drugs may affect people due to fluid and electrolyte shifts , low blood pressure, and psychoac tive effects. Medications for neuropathy can affect brain function. These secondary factors complicate predictions of driver safety in diabetes. According to the National Institution of Hea lth, diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes or poor blood sugar control. It can develop slowly after many years of diabetes or may occur early in the di sease. People with diabetes may develop nerve damage throughout the body and may manifest sy mptoms that include pain or numbness in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. The most common types of diabetic neuropathy may results in problems with sensation in the feet. The pain can be intense and require treatment to relieve the discomfort. The loss of sensation in the feet may also increase the possibility that foot injuries will go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected. In some cases, diabetic neuropathy can be Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 72 associated with difficulty walking and some w eakness in the foot musc les. There are other types of diabetic-related neuropa thies that affect specific pa rts of the body. For example, diabetic amyotrophy causes pain, weakness, and wasting of the thigh muscles, or cranial nerve infarcts that may result in double vision, a drooping eyeli d, or dizziness and lightheadedness. Most people with diabetes will eventually ha ve some kind of neuropathy. Symptoms may develop at any time; however the longer one has diabetes15 the greater risk of symptoms. These symptoms may affect the person's ability to operate a motor vehicle safely due to the diminished sensation of the hands and feet wh ile operating the steering wheel and pedals of the vehicle. In addition, the long-term eff ects on vision and cognition may place the safe operation of a vehicle at increased risk. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Diabetes: Driver Safety: The best available evidence on diabetes and driving is of low-to-moderate methodologic quality. This eviden ce indicates that th e average driver with diabetes (type 1165 or type 2164) has a statistically significant (19%) increase in risk for a motor vehicle collision compared to individuals w ithout diabetes. One possible mechanism for crashes is hypoglycemia14. While some case reports support th is, no well-designed study has provided direct evidence. Indirect evidence from multiple independent studies consistently shows that moderate-to-severe hypoglycemia impairs driving ability, cogn ition, and psychomotor function in some individuals w ith type 1 diabetes. A body of evidence indicates that insulin29 therapy is a key risk factor for hypoglycemia, yet evidence is not yet cl ear on whether insulin- dependent drivers are at a greate r risk for a motor vehicle col lision than non-insulin-treated drivers. Individuals with insu lin-treated diabetes may self-rest rict and have less exposure to risk. Because indirect evidence suggests that hypoglycemia is a key factor to increased crash risk in diabetes, educational programs have aimed to diminish its incidence. Blood glucose awareness training175 (BGAT176) appears to improve the ability to estimate blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes, but it is not clear if this leads to me asurable reductions in episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The value of BGAT has no t been assessed in type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed that directly compare crash risk data of individuals with non-insulin- and insulin-dependent diabetes and matc hed individuals without diabetes. Driver Performance: Drivers with diabetes, as a group, ar e at an increase d risk of having crashes. Although it is agreed that the majo r risk involved is th at associated with hypoglycemia, it appears that the hypoglycemic phenomenon by itself does not explain all the increased risk. Consequently, all drivers with di abetes should be counsel ed to the effect that they are at increased risk and that even m ild hypoglycemia should be avoided when they are driving. Frequent stops and snacks, easy ava ilability of glucose supplements, and early recognition of signs of impending hypoglycem ia are important in this context. DMVs4 concentrate their efforts on t hose drivers who suffer hypoglycemic14 episodes that require the assistance of a third party. Any drivers who experiences such episodes must not drive until their treating clinicians are certain that the risk of a repetition has been minimised. In some instances this period without driving ma y last several months and some experts feel that a three-month period for almost everyone in this situation w ould be appropriate. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 73 However, it is rea lly the clinical judgment of th e treating clinician that is the important factor since the individual's particular situation will be the major factor. Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes that require third-party inte rvention are a counter-indication to driving. Resuming driving for such an individual will, once again, depend upon an informed opinion from the treating clinician. Hypoglycemic unawareness, where the hypoglycemic episode occurs with no forewarning being perceived by the individual, is an absolute count er-indication to driving. As long as the unawareness persists, the person mu st be disqualified from driving. Insulin 29-treated diabetes15 is not, in itself, a justification for disqualification. However, the potential for a hypoglycemic episode is consider ed to be higher for the individual with insulin-treated diabetes than for a person treated by oral medication. Consequently, patient education as to the problems associated with dr iving and insulin-treated diabetes is important for this group. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: A person with a clinical diagnosis or history of diabetes mellitu s who seeks a license to drive a motor vehicle should be examined and certified by a qualified clinician (M.D./D.O.177) periodically. Those who encounter difficulties with control should be seen more frequently in accordance with their treating c linician's assessment of their requirements for follow-up and control. Any changes in status \u2014 for example, the initiation of insulin treatment \u2014 should be communicated to the DMV, preferably by the driver himself. Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes requiring third-pa rty assistance are incompatible with safe driving unless certification by the treating clinic ian demonstrates that the driver has been stable for three months. Following a hypoglycemic episode requiring third-party assistance, a driver should not resume driving unless the treating clinician has certified that the diabetes is under control. Hypoglycemic unawareness is in compatible with driving. Drivers with diabetes who experience hypoglycemic episodes requiring the intervention of a third-party should be subject to periodic medi cal controls at a frequency to be determined by the DMV. Before recommending that a patient with diabet es continue driving, the treating clinician should ensure that there is a good understanding of the disease, that the patient is free of hypoglycemic episodes, and that the patient is wi lling to follow the suggested treatment plan. The patient's compliance with the suggested therapy and the maintenance of blood sugar readings within an acceptable range are impor tant in establishing the patient's understanding and management of their condition. The patient should demonstrate that they are able to recognize incipient hypoglycemia14 and can take the appropriate action when they become symptomatic. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 74 To be certified to drive the applicant shoul d be judged to be com pliant with diabetes15 therapy and unlikely to have reduced driving ability due to diabetes or to complications affecting other organ systems (e.g., vision, cardiovascular, neurological32) mediating abilities that are critical to safely operating a motor vehicle. Before issuing a license, DMVs should requir e individuals with diabetes who require antihyperglycemic therapy 178 to be free of a pattern of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (i.e., insulin29 reactions) of 45 mg/dl or less, not have hypoglycemia unawareness, and show they are willing and ab le to properly monitor and manage their diabetes. DMVs should require drivers who use insulin to agree and comply w ith the following: (a) develop and maintain a clear and demonstrable understanding of th e relationship between blood sugar levels, food intake, exercise, insulin intake, and temporal effects of different insulins and doses, by means of diabetes training, and (b) submit a copy of the clinician's report to the DMV at the time of the recertification. Driving with diabetes treated with oral drugs or insulin can be a challe nge. Individuals with diabetes must plan their trips taking into cons iderations the particular ities of their medical condition. Frequent stops, blood sugar checks ev ery four hours, regular meals or snacks, and good hydration are essential for long trips. Drivers should interrupt their trips if they feel symptoms of impending hypoglycemia or if their blood sugar is lower than 70 mg/dL. They should not resume driving until they have recu perated completely. Drivers with diabetes treated with oral drugs or insu lin should wear bracelets iden tifying them as having diabetes. Any driver who suffers a hypoglycemic episode necessitating the assistance of another person must cease driving immediately and not resume driving until their treating clinician has informed them that they may do so. All drivers with diabetes s hould see their treating clinician on a regular basis. The frequency of visits will be determined by the clinician according to their assessment of the clinical situation. Evidence: 1. Individuals With Diabetes15 Mellitus Are at a Greater Risk for Motor Vehicle Crashes Compared to Individuals Without Diabetes Thirteen low-to-moderate quality case-control studies compared crash risk among drivers with diabetes to drivers wit hout diabetes. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled data showed that the risk for crashes among drivers with diabetes was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08-1.31) times greater than the risk for crashes among comparable drivers without diabetes (Tregear et al., 2007). The strong findings ar e weakened by factors relate d to study design, procedures, and potential bias inherent in case-control studies, particularly failure to control for differences in exposure to risk (amount of driving) between groups. Yet data from the 13 studies was homogeneous, suggesti ng that failure to control for differences in exposure did not result in biased risk-ratio estimates. Also, a sensitivity analysis that compared risk-ratio data in studies that controlled for exposure and studies that did not, found no evidence that Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 75 failure to control for exposure produced a syst ematic over or underestim ate of the observed risk ratio. It is unclear if drivers with type 1165 or type 2 diabetes164 are overrepresented among drivers who have had motor vehicle crashes. Three moderate-quality case-control studies of individuals over 65 with type 2 diabetes compared the prevalence of drivers with a nd without diabetes among drivers who had and who had not had a motor vehicle crash. A random -effects meta-analysis showed that drivers with diabetes are overrepresented among driver s who have crashed, bu t the result did not reach statistical significance (Odds Ratio=1.41; 95% CI: 0.86-2.29, P=0.1760). Consequently, it remains unclear whether drivers with Type 2 diabetes are overrepresented among populations of drivers who have had motor vehicle crashes. There is no comparable evidence for type 1 diabetes. It is unclear whether drivers with diabetes who use insulin29 are overrepresented among drivers who have had motor vehicle crashes. Three of the case-control studies above addresse d this issue. This data was homogeneous and was pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Drivers with insulin-dep endent diabetes tended to be overrepresented among drivers who have had crashes, but this result did not reach statistical significance (Odds Ratio=1.35; 95% CI: 0.86-1.70, P=0.1695). More data are needed for an evidence-based conclusion on whethe r drivers with diabetes treated with insulin are overrepresented among dr ivers who have crashed. Hypoglycemia 14 is a risk factor for a motor ve hicle crash among individuals with diabetes mellitus. Three small, moderate-quality studies assessed the eff ects of induced hypoglycemia on simulated driving ability in type 1 diabetes 165. All three studies found that driving ability was impaired during hypoglycemia. However, there was little agreement on exactly which aspects of driving are vulnerable to hypoglycemia and at what hypoglycemia levels. The available studies examined effects of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes only. Due to a paucity of data, it is not possible to quantify the relationship be tween the deterioration in driving performance and blood glucose163 levels. 2. Hypoglycemia14 Impairs Cognitive and Psychomoto r Function of Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes165 (Insulin29-Dependent Diabetes15 Mellitus) A number of small, low-to-moderate-quality studies assessed the effects of induced hypoglycemia on cognitive and psychomotor func tion. These studies co nsistently showed that moderate (blood glucose163 levels of ~ 2.5-3.0 mmol/L [45-54 mg/dl]) produced acute decline on performance on a range of cognitive and psychomotor tasks in some (but not all) individuals with insulin-d ependent diabetes. No comparable data are available on individuals with diabetes who do not need insulin. 3. Several Treatment Risk Factors Are Associ a ted With an Increased Risk of Severe Hypoglycemia in Diabetes Mellitus. Known treatment-related risk factors for severe hypoglycemia include lower HbA1c, insulin use, and multiple insulin injections per day. Whether specific treatments (types of insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or combinations th ereof) increase the incidence of severe Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 76 hypoglycemia in diabetes rem ains unclear. Epidemiology provides study designs for evaluating risk factors associated with a particular condition among representative populations, while controlling for other known risk factors. Several case-control studies or cohort studies attempted to determine the re lative risk for hypoglycemia with differing treatment options, regimes, or modes. Most available information comes from efficacy and safety studies, usually ra ndomized controlled trials 161 (RCTs)162, which may be considered to be the \"gold standard cohort studies\" for assessing treatment efficacy and safety. However, RCTs may not accurately estimate the true incide nce of hypoglycemia because they tend to be small and short-term, enroll selected patient s who do not reflect the broader population, and use protocols that do not reflect real-world disease management. 4. Whether Hypoglycemia Awareness Trai ning Can Pre vent Consequences of Hypoglycemia Is Unclear Blood glucose awareness training175 improves the ability of individuals with type 1 diabetes165 to accurately estimate their blood glucose163 levels. Five low- to-moderate-quality studies demonstrated that BGAT improves the ability of i ndividuals with type 1 di abetes to accurately estimate their blood glucose levels. However, it is not clear if BGAT reduces the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. Two m oderate-quality studies examin ed the incidence of severe hypoglycemia following BGAT in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One study found a benefit and the other did not. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 77 Chapter 4: Medical Conditions Obstructive Sleep Apnea Driver sleepiness is a major cause of motor vehi cle crashes. Most of these crashes probably occur in otherwise healthy but sleep-deprived drivers, but drivers w ith obstructive sleep apnea18 (OSA19) appear to be at particul ar risk. Other causes of excessive driver sleepiness include sleep deprivation due to medical, neurological32, and psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, licit and illicit drug usage, narcolepsy22, idiopathic hypersomnia179, restless leg syndrome180, and shift work sleep disorder. OSA is caused by recurrent airway obstruc tion during sleep. Obstruction causes apnea181, the cessation of breathing, which reduces blood oxygen sa turation. The tongue, tonsils, and other tissues can obstruct the upper airway, especially when muscles relax and the airway collapses during sleep. Jaw and airway structure and nasa l pathway obstruction may also be factors in OSA. Treatments for OSA include continuous positive airway pressure35 (CPAP36), surgical procedures, medications, and treatment of underl ying risk factors, particularly obesity. Some individuals with OSA may be unaware of their sleepiness a nd cognitive impairment, leading them to unwittingly engage in risky dr iving behavior. OSA is relatively common and affects about 2 to 4 percent of middle-aged pe ople, many of whom have not been diagnosed. Sleep fragmentation leads to chronic sleep deprivation and excessive daytime sleepiness 182 (EDS183), a cause of cognitive dysfunc tion. Repeated nocturnal hypoxia184 also causes cognitive deficits, some of which may be irre versible. Symptoms of OSA include chronic loud snoring, witnessed apneas or breathing pauses during sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Driver Safety: OSA increases crash risk. The predic tors of a crash are self-report of sleepiness (AHI21). The gold standard for assessing OSA is to conduct a polysomnograph187 (PSG188) or an overnight sleep study in a laboratory, although portable monitoring devices have also been used. CPAP is the only tr eatment demonstrated to reduce crash risk. However, once initiated, the treatme nt must be continued for as long as the person wishes to maintain their driver's license. It is difficult to show reduction of crash risk after one night of CPAP, but there is measurable im provement in surrogate markers of crash risk (e.g., disordered breathing, blood oxygen saturation) . CPAP reaches optimal effectiveness after two weeks. Any interruptions of CPAP, ev en if it's only for one day, can have adverse effects on driving fitness. Since CPAP takes at least two weeks to be fully effective, any interruption in treatment means at least a two-we ek interruption in drivi ng. In the event of non-compliance for a patient with OSA, no matter what the reason, driving should be ceased immediately. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 78 Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: 1. Drivers with daytime drowsiness should not drive until the ther apy suggested by the treating clinician has been shown to be effec tive. Even then, such drivers should monitor their drowsiness and cease driv ing immediately if they feel drowsy. A diagnosis of OSA19 precludes unconditional certificati on to drive a motor vehicle. A person with OSA may drive if they have untreated OSA with an AHI21 of 20 or below (an issue to resolve) and no daytime sleepiness, or has OSA that is being effectiv ely treated. An individual with OSA who meets these requirements should be recertified a nnually, based on demonstrating satisfactory compliance with therapy. Drivers with daytime sleepiness of an AHI of 20 or more may drive only if the condition has been treated effectiv ely for as long as the patient continues the therapy. Ceasing the therapy should be accompan ied by driving cessation if the OSA is still present. 2. People with a clinical diagnosis or history of OSA who seek certification to drive a motor vehicle should be examined and certified by a qualified clin ician at least annually. The clinician who would be evalua ting and treating drivers should be a qualified clinician (M.D./D.O. 177) with relevant expe rtise in sleep apnea181. To be certified to drive the applicant should demonstrate compliance with OSA ther apy (see introduction) and unlikely to have reduced driving ability due to OSA or to co mplications affecting other organ systems (e.g., vision, cardiovascular, neurological32). Also, individuals wi th OSA who require CPAP36 therapy should be free of repeated episode s of sleepiness, not have unawareness of impairment, show they are willing and able to properly monitor and manage their OSA, and sign a document indicating adherence to OSA therapy and awareness of risk of sleepy driving. 3. Drivers with OSA should not be certified for unrestricted driving if they report excessive sleepiness while driving, or have had a crash asso ciated with falling asleep, or have an AHI > 20 and have not yet been treate d for OSA successfully, including demonstration of adherence to therapy, or have been noncompliant with treatm ent. Drivers treated with surgery need to be re-evaluated for driving safety. 4. Driver's license applicants who meet the fo llowing criteria should be evaluated for OSA: high risk for OSA according to the Berlin Questionnaire 189, BMI186 33 kg/m2, small jaw, large neck size ( 17 inches in a man or 15.5 inches in a woman), sma ll airway or at risk for OSA based on a clinical evaluation. DMVs4 may screen for OSA in drivers. 5. Individuals with OSA who have had surgery treatment for weight loss may be certified to drive if they are compliant w ith CPAP, or are 6 months post-surgery (providing time for weight loss), have an AHI 20, are no longer excessively sleepy, and are cleared by the treating clinician. Individuals off CPAP therapy should be instructed to seek reevaluation if they gain significant weight or symptoms of OSA recur. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 79 6. Individuals with OSA19 who have been treated for apnea181 with oropharyngeal190, tracheostomy191, or facial bone surgery may be certifi ed if they are more than 1 month post- surgery, are cleared by trea ting clinician, have an AHI21 20 and are no longer excessively sleepy. Individuals off CPAP36 therapy should be instructed to seek reevaluation if symptoms of OSA recur. 7. Drivers with OSA who use CPAP must agree and comply with: (a) submitting sleep logs and CPAP usage to thei r clinician at their periodic examinations or when directed by their State DMVs, (b) submitting a copy of the clinic ian's report to the DMV at the time the recertification, and (c) undergoing education on the importance of adequate slee p and relevant lifestyle changes including weight loss, smoking cessa tion, regular exerci se, reduced alcohol consumption, treatment compliance, consequences of untreated OSA including loss of driver's license, motor ve hicle collisions, hypertension 192, cognitive dysfunction193, heart disease194, reflux esphagitis195, headaches, sleep disruption, reduc ed quality of life, shorter survival, and effects of respiratory or cen tral nervous system depressants on OSA. Evidence: 1. Drivers With OSA Have a Greater Motor Vehicle Crash Risk Than Individuals Without OSA Seventeen case-control studies of low to moderate quality show that drivers with OSA are at greater risk for motor vehicle crashes than similar drivers without OSA. Analysis of combined data from 9 of the 15 studies showed that individuals with OSA are between 30 percent and 472 percent more likel y to have a crash. The mean crash risk ratio is 2.72, which indicates individuals with OSA have a 172 perc ent increased chance of a motor vehicle crash (Tregear et al., 2008) 2. Several Disease-Related Factors Predict In creased Mo tor Vehicle Crash Risk in OSA Ten studies addressed these issu es in OSA. Several paramete rs repeatedly indicate high motor vehicle crash risk: (a) Se verity of disordered respirat ion during sleep indexed by the AHI21 or the RDI196; (b) presence and degree of daytime sleepiness measured using the ESS197 (Epworth Sleepiness blood oxygen level; and (d) BMI186. There are no clear cut-points for the prediction measures. Evidence suggests a continuum, e.g., as BMI increases motor vehicle crash risk increases. Research shows a difference in crash risk between obese (defined as BMI of 30 or greater) and non-obese individuals. 3. Individuals With OSA19 Become Unsafe Soon After Cessation of CPAP36 (e.g., Due to Noncompliance) Evidence suggests that individua ls with OSA are not good at j udging how sleepy they are. Three studies used ESS197 self-report questionnaire scores to index sleepiness before and after treatment with CPAP. In one study, subjects with moderate-to-seve re OSA judged their sleepiness levels before CPAP as being much higher than they had originally reported. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 80 Another study found discrepancies between subj ective and objective m easures of sleepiness on ESS and MSLT199 scores. A third study found no difference in ESS in OSA and ESS scores estimated by their partners. 4. Screening and Diagnostic Tests May Help to Identify Individuals With OSA (Who Are at Increased Risk for Crashes) Severity of OSA is most accurately measured with PSG188 in controlled clinical settings. Forty-three studies (32 high-quality, 11 moderate -quality) assessed if different portable treatment systems are as good as a PSG test in a sleep lab for assessi ng OSA. The portable instruments are not as accurate , but may be a sufficient and less expensive alternative to a PSG test in a sleep lab. Cost-b enefits analysis would be needed to determine consequences of false negative and false positive outcomes with a portable system. No psychometric instrument, score, or model has been shown to accurately predict motor vehicle crash risk in individuals with OSA. (See Centers for Me dicare & Medicaid Services 2008 guidelines regarding use of portable units.) 5. OSA Treatment Can Reduce Crash Risk Several randomized control trials assessed trea tments for OSA. Only CPAP is shown to reduce crash risk in OSAA meta-analysis. Treg ear et al. (2008) indicat ed that crash risk declines by ~ 72 percent following CPAP. It is not clear if CPAP reduces crash risk in OSA to normal levels. Some patients may not recove r fully because of co-morbid factors such as cerebral vascular disease or effects of repeated hypoxia184 on brain function. Other interventions in OSA include medications, de ntal appliances (mandibular advancement), surgery (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty203), behavioral modification, a nd weight loss, but there is insufficient evidence on how these aff ect driving or surrogate measures. 6. Optimal Treatment of Sleep Disordered B reathing in At-Risk Drivers With OSA Is Reached Within 2 Weeks Twenty-four studies assessed time to reach optimal effectiveness of therapy in OSA. These included 8 high-quality, 14 moderate -quality and 2 low-quality st udies. Crash risk reduction among individuals with OSA is reported after as little as one night of CPAP. Simulated driving performance, severity of disordered respiration, blood oxyge n saturation, and some cognitive and psychomotor performance scores also improve after one night of CPAP. The number of nights needed to reach maximu m CPAP benefit is probably <2 weeks. 7. Individuals With OSA19 Become Unsafe Soon After Cessation of CPAP36 (e.g., Due to Noncompliance) Four studies assessed the eff ects of stopping CPAP. CPAP cessation increases OSA severity and daytime sleepiness and decreases simulate d driving performance. Deterioration may occur as soon as 24 hours after CPAP cessation. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 81 Chapter 4: Medical Conditions Seizures A seizure17 is a sudden alteration in behavior that may range from loss of consciousness or body control to a mild subjective feeling, due to acute abnormal brain el ectrical activity. People who have had a seizure are generally at greater risk for another seizure than people who have never had a seizure. The risk de pends on the underlying cause. As a rule, the longer the seizure-free period, the less likely a pe rson is to have another seizure. Epilepsy16 is the common medical disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Pa tients with epilepsy (seizure disorders) are at increased risk for motor vehicle crashes because of a seizure, the underlying condition causing seizures, or anti-epileptic drug30 (AED31) side effects. Epilepsy patients who have ongoing seizures are legally or medically forbi dden to drive. Many patents with epilepsy (perhaps two-thirds) have well-c ontrolled seizures based on effective treatment with AEDs or (less commonly) surgery for epilep sy. Patients who are seizure-free for periods varying from 3 to 18 months are generally pe rmitted to seek driving privileges, and many drive. The incidence of epilepsy is approximately 0.5-1.0 percent worldwide, in the range of type 2 diabetes 164, lung cancer in men, or breast cancer in wo men. In the United States there is a 9- to 10-percent lifetime risk of a spontaneous seiz ure. In epilepsy, the risk of another seizure drops below 2 percent in patients who are seizure-free for more than 10 years, an annual risk of approximately .05 percent. However, it is not possible to predic t precisely whether and when a subsequent seizure will occur. The many causes of seizures include stroke 23, tumor, trauma, hypertension192, infections, abnormal blood vessels of the brain, complicatio ns of pregnancy, liver and kidney disease, alcohol, illicit drugs such as cocaine, medication withdrawal , and high fever in children. Epilepsy includes a range of seizure types, some of which pose greater risks for driving safety than others. Some types of ep ilepsy (such as febrile seizures204) are confined to childhood and resolve in adulthood; other types may occur only at night while asleep. Broadly, seizure types may be considered as e ither partial or generalized. Partial seizure 205 types are most common, occurring in approximately 70 percent of all those with seizures, and are either simple partial206, complex partial207, or secondary generalized208. Symptoms of partial seizures depend on which area of the br ain generates the seizur es and how quickly and how far an individual seizure may spread th rough the brain, and commonly vary in type within a given individual. In simple partial seizures, the patient is alert, conscious, and remembers what happened during the event. Depending upon which area the seizure arose from in the brain, behavioral alterations vary between abnormal motor activity such as posturing or twitching, peculiar id eation including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (the feeling that something that should be unfamiliar has happened before), a feeling of numbness or tingling, or peculiar visual sensations such as flashing lights or even formed hallucinations 63. In complex partial seizures207, consciousness is impaired, and patients cannot recall what happened. A partial seizure of either of these types may al so progress to a generalized seizure. Generalized seizures208 include several types. Tonic-clonic seizures209 (grand mal seizures) generally last between 30 seconds to 2 mi nutes and start with body stiffening followed by Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 82 jerk ing of the arms and legs, loss of cons ciousness, occasional tongue biting and loss of bladder or bowel control, and post-ictal210 confusion. Tonic seizures211 last 5 to 20 seconds and involve flexion and extensi on of the trunk, neck, and limbs, and often occur at night. Absence seizures212 are brief (3 to 20 seconds) stari ng episodes that impair cognition and awareness without warning or post-icta l confusion. Atypical absence seizures213 last up to 30 seconds, and include staring, and occasional eye-blinking an d lip-twitching. Myoclonic seizures214 involve jerking of the muscles of the neck, trunk, shoulders, upper arms, and upper legs, while conscious. Atonic seizures215 last up to a minute, and are comprised of sudden loss of body tone, with head nods, jaw drops , falls, and impaired consciousness. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Seizures: Driver Safety: The U.S. mortality rate report indicat es that the number of fatal driver crashes related to seizures17 is relatively small. During a 3-year period there were 80 to 97 fatal crashes annually involving drivers with seizure disorders, indicating that only a small fraction of total fatal driver crashes in the United States are related to seizure occurrence while driving. Some seizure types probably create lower risk for driving than others. These include simple partial seizures206 that do not interfere with co nsciousness or motor control, seizures with consistent and prolonged auras216, a pattern of pure nocturnal seizures, and seizures related to acute reversible illnesses or exposures (such as anesthetics) that are unlikely to be repeated while driving. Retrospective studies of epilepsy16 patients who had motor vehicle collisions attributed to seiz ures suggest that complex partial seizures207 (involving loss of consciousness) pose the most significant risk, particularly when not preceded by an aura. However, evidence to guide determination of fair State driving laws is st ill generally lacking; for example, one recent study of crash rates in drivers with epilepsy preceding and following a change in legal restrictions in Arizona (i .e., reduction from Stat e requirements from a 12- month to a 3-month seizure-free interval) show ed no significant increase in seizure-related crashes. Regulations on driving certifi cation vary but often require a seizure-free period on or off medications of several months, 6 months bei ng common. Changes to re gulations should be supported by evidence, readily en forced, and implemented at DMV 4 and medical examiner offices, and transparent to the public. Severe restrictions may discourage drivers fr om reporting seizures to their clinicians, lessening the chances that they will seek treat ment and increasing their health- and driving safety risks. In this situa tion, clinicians may be discouraged from reporting drivers who have had a seizure, but there is potential liability fo r certifying poten tially unsafe drivers. Duration of the seizure-free period helps to predict futu re risk for seizure re currence. The odds of crashing are markedly reduced with long seizur e-free intervals. Annual risk of seizure recurrence is < 2 percent after 8 years and < 1 percent after 10 years (which is still 20 times greater than the genera l population seizure risk of 0.05% per year). The tolerable risk of a seizure17 while driving depends on specific circumstances. The risk relationship between seizures a nd car crashes is continuous, but not in a linear fashion; the Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 83 difference between 3 and 6 m onths is very small and there is no clear cutoff. A driver who is seizure-free for 6 months is probably safer to certify than a driv er who has been seizure-free for 3 months, however there is no evidence to say th at the latter have more crashes. Rules for commercial drivers are traditionall y much more stringent because of the high stakes of a crash by, say, a driver of a passenger bus or tractor-trailer. Information on seizure-free periods as an index of seizure control often depends on patient accounts, which may be inaccurate. Consequently, evaluation of driving risk in epilepsy 16 should consider additional factors besides seizure-free interval, including specific seizure types, causes and treatment factors. There are few data on crash risk in specific ep ilepsy subtypes, yet some types may carry lower risk. These include si mple partial seizures 206 that do not interfere with consciousness or motor control, seizures with consistent and prolonged auras216, a pattern of pure nocturnal seizures, and seizures related to reversible acute illnesses. Having a seizure differs from having a crash. Many patients will crash if they have a seizure while driving, but some with auras may have sufficient warning to abort a tr ip or pull off the road. There are concerns about the effects of discontinuing or a ltering a driver's an ti-epileptic drug30 (AED31) drug regimen because of increased seizure risk and drug side effects. AEDs that produce the lowest risk of cognitive and psychomotor impairment should be encouraged and drugs with highest risk of impairment s hould be discouraged. There is insufficient evidence on whether restricted licensure in epilepsy is an effective countermeasure. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: 1. A diagnosis or history of se izures should preclude unconditional certification to drive. 2. A driver with a history of epilepsy who has been granted conditional certification to drive must be recertified on a periodic basis. 3. Antiepileptic drugs are known to produce side effects in some patients that may affect driving. Normally patients who are affected by AEDs will complain to their clinicians, who should then counsel them on restri cting their driving until the si de effects have passed. Such patients should have their levels of the drug mo nitored regularly and should be counseled to cease driving if toxic effects occur. 4. To be conditionally certified to drive the applicant should be judged (a) unlikely to have a seizure17 while driving, (b) unlikely be impaired by the condition causing the seizures or to have complications in other organ systems medi ating abilities that are critical to safely operating a motor vehicle, (c) free of a pattern of repeated episodes of AED31 side effects or noncompliance, (d) show willingness and abil ity to properly monitor and manage the condition, (e) be educated not to drive for long hours without rest, not to drive when fatigued or ill, and to avoid excessive alcohol use, and (f) sign a document indicating adherence to AED therapy, awareness of AED toxicit y, and seizure reporting requirements. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 84 5. Following a unique seizure, the patient should not drive while under investigation. Driving may be resumed if the neurological32 and cardiac investigations have not revealed a cause or if a treatable cause ha s been identified and the therapy successful. If the neurological investigation reveals that the patient is epileptic16, they will be subjected to the local jurisdiction's medical standard for an epileptic seizure. 6. Following a diagnosis of epilepsy, the driver should undergo an annual examination by the treating clinician. The frequenc y of the controls by the trea ting clinician may be relaxed gradually in accordance with the treating clinician's clinical a ssessment of the situation. 7. Drivers with epilepsy must agre e and comply with the following: (a) know the regulations and restrict ions for driving with epilepsy (b) submit seizure logs to their clinicians at their periodic examination or when directed by their State DMV, and (c) submit a copy of the clinician's report to the DMV at the time of the recertification. 8. Drivers with epilepsy who are seizure-free but still require AEDs for seizure control require periodic recertification on a cas e-by-case basis with medical re porting from private clinician. 9. Cessation of AEDs may lead to a new seizure. The driver w ho suffers a seizure following a prescribed cessation of AEDs should not drive until therapeutic levels of AEDs are achieved that are comparable to the levels prior to the cessation of AEDs. 10. People with alcohol withdraw al seizures should not be recertified unless a qualified clinician determines that they will abstain pe rmanently from all further drinking. To qualify for recertification, the patient should have attended an alcohol treatment program and be seizure-free for at least 6 months. If substance abuse or dependence is present that meets the diagnostic criteria described in DSM-IV, driv ing is counter indicated until the person meets the diagnostic criteria for prolonged remission. Jurisdictiona l requirements vary for alcohol treatment program attendance and other measures such as ignition interlock devices that may be compulsory. 11. Drivers who take AEDs for seizure prophylaxis 217 or control should have their AED levels monitored (including serum drug le vels as appropriate) and shoul d be evaluated for signs of drug toxicity. They should sign an affidavit certifying they have been seizure-free for at least 6 months, compliant with medicatio n, and free of drug side effects. 12. Drivers with epilepsy16 who no longer require AEDs31 and have not had a seizure17 for at least 2 years should no longer requir e annual medical recertification. 13. Drivers with epilepsy who take AEDs shoul d be warned not to drive after medication adjustment if the medication adjustment results in central nervous system adverse effects that could impact safe driving. 14. Drivers with epilepsy who take AEDs and e xperience central nervous system side effects that could impair driving safety in the opinion of the treating clinicia n should be warned not to drive until they are free from side effects following medication adjustments. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 85 15. Drivers with epilepsy who take AEDs and have been seizure-free on AEDs, no matter how long, and then have their AEDs tapered shou ld be warned not to drive after m edication adjustment for a period of at least one to 3 m onths and should also ha ve annual re certification for 2 years. 16. Patients who have had surgical treatment for epilepsy should be seizure-free for 6 months after surgery before seeking driver's li cense recertification, and should receive a neurological 32 examination to ensure that no major surgical complications resulting in cognitive or visual field impairment that could aff ect safe driving have occurred. 17. A history of a single, unprovoked seizure precl udes unconditional certific ation to drive. A person who has a new seizure should not be elig ible for licensure until a detailed neurologic evaluation is completed. Conditional certification to drive may be possible if the driver has been seizure-free for at least 6 months on or off AEDs. An individual who has had a single, unprovoked seizure and has been gran ted conditional certif ication to drive must be recertified after one year. Whether an individual who ha d had a single provoked se izure can be certified requires an expert medical evaluation to determ ine whether the individual is at low risk for exposure to the seizure precipitant . Examples include a lidocaine 218 induced seizure during a medical procedure, postconcussive219 seizure in the immediate aftermath of a mild head injury, a seizure from an acute toxic metabolic124 derangement not likely to recur, or an episode of convulsive syncope220. 18. Individuals with a probable si ngle episode of drug toxicity ma y be treated less restrictively than those with structural br ain lesions, depending on the outcome of the neurological evaluation. 19. Individuals with seizures provoked by struct ural brain lesions (e .g., tumor, trauma, and infection) should be assessed more stringently than those with other causes (e.g., a single seizure caused by exposure to a drug, such as lidocaine, or a history of febrile seizures 204 in childhood). 20. Conditions that are at moderate-to-high risk for further seizures, which would militate against certification, include more severe h ead injury (with loss of consciousness or amnesia 221 greater than 30 minutes or penetra ting head injury), brain hemorrhage222 due to stroke or trauma, infecti ons such as encephalitis223, meningitis224, brain abscess225 and cysticercosis226, stroke, tumors and brain surgery. 21. Individuals who have had an unprovoked seizure 17 and who have a history of a previous provoked seizure should be cons idered as having epilepsy16. 22. A driver who suffers a convulsive seizure is unfit to drive for a pe riod of at least six months following the incident. Resumption of driving requires a positive recommendation by the treating clinician. 23. A driver who suffers a convulsive seizure ca used by abuse of alcohol or drugs is unfit to drive until they can demonstrate a period of at least six months of abstinence. 24. A driver with epilepsy is subject to peri odic medical controls at a frequency to be determined by the DMV 4. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 86 References: Drazkowski, J. F., Fisher, R.

Individuals With Epilepsy Are at a G rea ter Risk for a Motor Vehicle Crash Compared With Individual's Without Epilepsy A recent meta-analysis of available evidence indicates they are 1.13 to 2.16 times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash than comparable individuals who do not have epilepsy. The limited data come from several lower-quality stud ies. Additional data suggest a significant reduction in risk if a dr iver has a reliable aura216 (seizure warning) before onset of a seizure. 2. Seizure Recurrence Likelihood Decreases as Time Since Last Seizure Increases in Patients Taking AED31 Treatment. The likelihood of seizures among those on AEDs is difficult to predict. No high-quality studies are available, but availa ble data suggest that risk of seizure is significantly reduced after eight seizure-free years (to about 2% per ye ar). The risk is further reduced to about 1 percent after 10 seizure-free years. 3. Seizure17 Recurrence Likelihood Decreases as Ti me Since Last Seizure Increases in Patients Who Have Had Surgery for Epilepsy16 Limited data indicates that the longer a person is seizure-free, the less likelihood there is of a future seizure. The risk of seizures is similar to those of people on AEDs31, about 2 percent per year after eight years. 4. Seizure Recurrence Risk After a Single Lifeti me Unprovoked Seizure There is a high rate of additional seizures in the second year; however seizure risk declines significantly so that the risk of seizur e is about 2 percent by the fifth year. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 87 Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 88 5. Seizure Recurrence Risk and AED Therapy Compliance (Based o n Serum Drug Levels) One study showed no significant increase in cras h rate regardless of whether a driver was consistent in taking AEDs. Four studies show ed conflicting or inconsistent results. No evidence-based conclusion can be drawn. 6. Long-Term Effects of an AED on Surr ogate Markers of Driver Safety Among Individuals With Epilepsy Two small studies suggested a negative effect on driving skills, but the data were limited and neither relied on driving performance measures for results. No evidence-based conclusion can be drawn. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 89 Chapter 5: Temporary Conditions Introduction DMVs4 require a certain time to perform the admini strative procedures involved in processing a dossier or case and rendering a decision on driver fitness. Consequently, conditions that will limit driving fitness for a short period of several weeks will be resolved before the DMV can complete the administrative procedures. Such temporary conditions are the purview of the treating clinician rather th an the DMV and advice on fitness to drive should be included in the treating clinician's discharge instructions to his patient. Patients who refuse to follow the advice of the treating clinician s hould be referred to the DMV if the clinician believes that their driving is potentially hazardous, as reco mmended by the American Medical Association. Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury/Surgery Surgical repair to the anterior cruciate ligament227 in the right knee results in compromised stability of the joint and decreased reacti on time in the weeks immediately following the operation. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury/Surgery: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers with anterior cruciate ligament surgical repairs and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: Two studies examining partial ta sk performance of driving (brake reaction time) were conducted using experimental designs to determine a safe time threshold to resume driving following surgical repair of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Gotlin and colleagues (2000) noted the br ake response time decreased steadily over the 10 weeks following surgery, but clear improvements to th e point of safety occurred until week 4. Nguyen, Hau, and Bartlett (2000) found that 75 percent of the sample returned to preoperative reaction time 6 weeks after surgery. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 90 Table of the Quality of Evidence Measurement of Brake Response Time Af ter Right Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (Gotlin, Sherman, Sierra, Kelly, & Scott, 2000) Objective Find out how many weeks is necessary to wait to drive after ACL228surgery. Level/Design Participants 2 groups: 1 group (n=10) right ACL surgery; 1 (n=12) aged matched controls with no history of right knee dysfunction Intervention and Outcome Measurement Brake response time (BRT). How ma ny weeks until they can drive again? Results Brake response time decreased over a 10-week period ( P = .043). Clear improvement in BRT scores until week 4. Person with right ACL reconstruction can drive safely 4 weeks after surgery. Limitations Confounding variables may have delaye d return to normal BRT if they had measured them. Limb strengthening typi cally does not occur until 3 to 6 weeks of rehab (can take place as early as 2). Study sample size was small and cannot guarantee they will be safe drivers at the point of 4 weeks. Driving Reaction Time Before and After Anterior Cruciate Ligament227 Reconstruction (Nguyen, Hau, & Bartlett, 2000) Objective Determine driving reaction time of right knee in normal controls and in patients with ACL228 instability in right knee or left knee. Level/Design Participants 73 patients who underwent ACL reconstruc tion together with 25 normal subjects as controls. Driving reaction test performed on computer linked automobile simulator constructed by department of el ectrical and computer system engineering of Monash University. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Tests carried out 24 hours before operation a nd 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after surgery. Regardless of which knee was operated on, tests were performed on right leg. Performance of each of these 2 tests in 10 seconds was recorded. Results Six weeks post surgery, right ACL group: 37.5 percent returned to preoperative level in stepping test, 56.3 percent returned to standing test and 75 percent returned to reaction time test. Surgery on the le ft knee does not affect driving reaction time of right leg, and patients are able to resume as early as 2 weeks after surgery. After right ACL reconstruction patient s should wait 6 weeks before resuming driving. Limitations Simulator only tested with automatic transmission. Other Considerations: Drivers enter surgery with vary ing levels of health and fitn ess with different comorbidities229 of other diagnoses that may slow or hasten the healing proces s and therefore decisions about resumption of driving should consider the overall health and well-being of the driver. In addition, all studies were c onducted with simulators usi ng automatic transmission and therefore cannot make pred ictions about operating manua l transmission vehicles. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 91 Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Individuals may resume driving 4 to 6 weeks following anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 92 Chapter 5: Temporary Conditions Disk injury Disk injuries typically involve a herniation230 or rupture of one or mo re vertebral disks that provide cushioning and flexibility between each ve rtebra from the neck down to the pelvis. The status of a disk injury can range along a continuum and includes a bulge, herniation, rupture, surgical replacement , or removal and fusion of th e vertebrae. The functional implications of a disk injury as they are a ssociated to driving are largely due to pain, decreased range of motion, decrea sed strength, and impaired sens ation. Individuals with disk injuries may have difficulty entering/exiting a vehicle, reaching/releasing the seat belt, fastening/unfastening the seat belt, operating the ignition, turning to see the entire driving environment to observe obstacles or make la ne changes, maneuvering the leg between the accelerator and brake pedals, steering, or reachi ng for any vehicle controls located on the steering column or dashboard area. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety an d Performance With Respect to Disk injury: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers sustaining a disk in jury and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: A study of driving performance while wearing a neck orthosis 231, like a driver with a cervical n eck injury would wear, revealed that the limited range of motion caused by the orthosis results in slower speed s, decreased lateral acce leration around corners, and less than optimal visual evaluation of traffi c and obstacles at intersections (Barry, Smith, Lennarson, Jermeland, Darling, Steirman, et al., 2003). The authors suggest that while there is no evidence that wearing a neck brace increases crashes, there could be an increased risk for crashes. Table of the Quality of Evidence The Effect of Wearing a Restrictive Neck Brace on Driver Performance (Barry, Smith, Lennarson, Jermeland, Darling, Stierman, et al., 2003) Objective Assess the effects of wearing a restric tive neck brace on driver performance on the open road. Level/Design Participants Prospective, randomized block design137, 23 licensed drivers without neck injuries. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Completion of a 20-minute road test both with and without a cervical orthosis 231. Results The cervical orthosis reduced cervical range of motion while driving and resulted in decreased speed, decreased lateral accel eration, and suboptimal evaluation of intersection traffic. Limitations Narrow sample size. Sample did not have neck problems and therefore the results may not accurately reflect driving performance in a person experiencing decreased mobility and pain. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 93 Other Considerations: Individuals with disk injuries may be taking prescription or over-the-counter medication to alleviate pain and therefore all medication contraindications80 should be considered including drowsiness and medication interactions. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Given the complicated and variable nature of disk injuries re lated to location and severity, individuals with limitations in other areas of functi onal performance should be considered on a case-by-case basis with comprehensive te sting to determine fitness to drive. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 94 Chapter 5: Temporary Conditions Fracture Fractures, or a broken bone, can be sustaine d in any of the 206 bones of the body. When a bone in one of the extremities occurs, it may interrupt operation of the vehicle controls due to pain or limitations in range of moti on from a cast or external fixator232. In these situations where there is an acute injury (fracture, disloc ation) or a post-surgical situation, the functional limitations may be temporary. Individuals may ha ve difficulty operating the foot pedals if the right lower extremity is fractured and may ha ve difficulty with steering, shifting gears, operating the directional signal, turning the ignition, or any ot her control requiring reach or dexterity if a bone in the upper extremity is fractured. As long as the immobilization is in place or the affected articulati on has not achieved full mobility the driver should be advised to refrain from driving. Attempting to drive using the unaffected left leg to operate the pedals, using a stick to work the clutch, or having a co-driver work the stick-shift are not safe alternatives to temporary driver cessation in this situation. The removal of an immobilization after seve ral weeks of immobilization does not imply instant fitness to resume driving. A three to four week immobilization of an ankle may take up to nine weeks before the ankle achieves fu ll function. While this does not mean that the resumption of driving requires an additional nine weeks, it does mean that resumption should only occur when the mobility of the articulation is adequate for driving rather than immediately following cast removal. Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Fracture: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers with fractures and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: In a study of control over ve hicle functions comparing three different upper-extremity casts, it was determined that casts that rest rict thumb movement significantly impair control (Blair, Chaudhri, & Gregori, 2001). A similar study comparing driving performance with short and long arm casts on the left and right extremities discovered the inability to drive safely with any type of cast on eith er upper extremity (Kalamaras, Rando, & Pitchford, 2006). The ability to return to driving after a lower-extremity fracture is considered differently as individuals need to quickly and accurately operate the vehicle foot pedals. A repeated measures study of 31 indi viduals following surgical repair of ankle fractures was conducted against a healthy contro l sample and determined that nine weeks following surgery drivers' reaction times returned to normal (Egol, Sheikhazadeh, Mogatederi, Barnett, & Koval, 2003). Table of the Quality of Evidence Doctor, Can I Drive With This Plaster? An Evidence Based Response (Blair, Chaudhri, & Gregori, 2002) Objective Assess the effect of commonly used below elbow plaster casts on driving ability. Level/Design Case control study, same driver used for all tests after having three different casts Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 95 Participants applied and completing separate driving tests. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Road test following the application of cast. Colles cast: below elbow cast leaving thumb and fingers free. Wrist flexed to 20\u00b0. Scaphoid casts: below elbow cast with thumb immobilized up to IP joint. Bennett's cast: below elbow cast with thumb immobilized in extension. Driving abilities tested: gear changing, steering, reversing, hand break control, indicator/horn control and around town driving. Results Colles cast is unlikely to affect driving controls in most cases. Scaphoid and Bennett's-type casts have significant effects on driving control. Limitations Only one person used to test three casts. Lower Extremity Function for Driving an Automobile After Operative Treatment of Ankle Fracture (Egol, Sheikhazadeh, Mogatederi, Barnett, & Koval, 2003) Objective Determine when patients recover the ability to operate the foot controls of a motor vehicle following operative repair of an ankle fracture. Level/Design Participants Repeated measures study of 31 individuals who had fractured their right ankles. Intervention and Outcome Measurement Measure of simulated driving performance on a simulator at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-surgery. Each variable tested 6 times for each of 3 driving scenarios (city, suburban, and highway). Results Total brake time was 1,079 msec72 for group I and group II- 1,330, 1,172, and 1,160 msec for group II at 6, 9, and 12 weeks. Total braking consistently improved for each of the driving scenarios at each successive data point. At 9 weeks, braking response returns to normal. Limitations Driving simulator was not actual vehicle. Driving Plastered: Who Does It, Is It Safe, and What to Tell Patients (Kalamaras, Rando, & Pitchford, 2006) Objective Determine the ability to safely drive wh ile wearing an upper extremity cast. Level/Design Participants Case control study, same driver used for road tests wearing short and long arm casts on the right and left upper extremity. Intervention and Outcome Measurement A road test while wearing various upper-limb casts. Results No cast: Passed driving tests. Right short arm cast: Failed driving tests in both manual and automatic transmission vehicles. Right long arm cast: Failed driving tests in both manual and automatic transmission vehicles. Left short arm cast: Failed driving tests in both manual and automatic transmission vehicles. Left long arm cast: Failed driving tests in both manual and automatic transmission vehicles. Limitations Driving test carried out by professional rather than actual client so results may not accurately reflect how a driver with a painful fracture would perform. Other Considerations: A person who has sustained a facture may be using prescription or over-the-counter medication to alleviate pain and ther efore all medication contraindications80 should be considered, including drowsiness a nd medication interactions. In addition, factors other than reaction time should be considered prior to resuming driving, including pain and weight- bearing status. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 96 Both studies of upper extremities were conducted in countries where driving occurs on the left side of the road and therefore results related to le ft versus right upper-extremity fractures should be interpreted with cauti on and consideration of the right-sided driving laws of the United States. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Individuals with upper-extremity casts should delay driving resumption until the cast is removed if a large portio n of the arm and/or the thumb is immobilized. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 97 Chapter 5: Temporary Conditions Hip Arthroplasty A person undergoing hip arthroplasty233 surgery has all or some of the parts of a hip joint replaced following a hip fractur e or to replace a joint deteriorated from arthritis. Many surgical patients must adhere to strict \"hip precautions\" that prohibit certain movements of the hip for as long as three months. Those restri cted movements -- hip fl exion greater than 90 \u00b0 (often used to transition from accelerator to brake), hip internal rotation (often used to transition from accelerator to brake), and hip adduction (often used to transition from accelerator to brake) -- are typically involve d in the operation of an automobile and transferring in and out of the vehicle. In a ddition, many individuals must adhere to weight- bearing precautions that limit the amount of fo rce that can be pushed up through the hip that might become necessary during hard braking. Th e functional implications of hip arthroplasty are transferring in and out of the vehicle, oper ating the accelerator and the brake (with right hip surgery), and operating the clutch or emergency brake (with left hip surgery). Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Hip Arthroplasty: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers with hip arthropl asty and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: Ganz and colleagues (2003) studi ed the rate at which reaction time returned following total hip arthroplasty surgery and found th at reaction time returned four to six weeks following surgery. In an effort to sp eed the recovery process and return to function, Berger and colleagues (2004) studied a minimally invasive surgical procedure coupled with a rapid rehabilitation protocol and found clients were able to retu rn to driving six days after surgery. Table of the Quality of Evidence Rapid Rehabilitation and Recovery With Mi nimally Invasive Total Hip Arthroplasty (Berger, Jacobs, Meneghini, Dell a Valle, Paprosky, & Rosenberg, 2004) Objective Assess potential recovery rate and return to function following hip surgery. Level/Design Participants 100 patients prospectively enrolled in study of surgical and rehabilitation protocol. Intervention and Outcome Measurement A minimally invasive surgical total hip arthroplasty (THA 234) followed by rapid progression through rehabilitation. Results The average time to drive for the 98 pati ents who drove was 6 days compared to 4 to 8 weeks using old surgical and rehabilitation techniques. Limitations None Table of the Quality of Evidence Improvement in Driving Reaction Time After Total Hip Arthroplasty233 (Ganz, Levin, Peterson, & Ranawat, 2003) Objective Determine rate of improvement in driving reaction time after total hip arthroplasty Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 98 and determine when driving reaction time after total hip arthroplasty returns to preoperative values. Level/Design Participants Repeated measures of brake reaction tim e among 90 individuals with total hip arthroplasty trial (52 right hip; 38 left hip). Intervention and Outcome Measurement Preoperative and serial postoperative (1 week, 4 to 6 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks) partial task measures of break reaction time using the AAA brake reaction timer. Results Mean reaction time was slower 1 week after surgery. Reaction time improved at 4 to 6 weeks (p<.001), 26 weeks (p<.001), and 52 weeks (p<.001) and was faster than the preoperative reaction time. Mean reaction times: Preoperative .56 \u00b1 .12 1 week post .59 \u00b1 .22 4 to 6 weeks post .50 \u00b1 .09 26 weeks post .45 \u00b1 .06 52 weeks post .48 \u00b1 .08 Limitations Hip pain and muscle strength were not addressed in this study. Only brake reaction time considered, not driving performance or safety. Other Considerations: Individuals who have undergone hi p replacement surgery may be facing a period of time with compromised weight-bearing stat us, observance of hip precauti ons, or any number of co- morbid235 diagnoses. The individuals may be us ing prescription or over-the-counter medication to alleviate pain and ther efore all medication contraindications80 should be considered, including drowsiness a nd medication interactions. In addition, factors other than reaction time should be considered prior to resuming driving, including pain and weight- bearing status. Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Advice regarding when to resume driving should be determined by side of surgery, invasiveness of surgical proce dure, time for adherence, and to tal hip arthroplasty precautions. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 99 Chapter 5: Temporary Conditions Knee Arthroplasty A person who has undergone knee ar throplastic surgery has all or some of the parts of the knee joint replaced to rec onstruct a joint deteriorated from arthritis. Many individuals must adhere to weight-bearing precautions that lim it the amount of force that can push up through the knee that might become necessary during ha rd braking. The functional implications of knee arthroplasty are transferring in and out of the vehicle, op erating the acce lerator and the brake (with right knee surgery) and operating the clutch or em ergency brake (with left knee surgery). Review of Evidence on Driver Safety and Performance With Respect to Knee Arthroplasty233: Driver Safety: The literature review was unable to identify any study that examines the relationship between drivers w ith knee arthroplasty and safety, specifically motor vehicle collisions, injurious crashes, fatal crashes, or violations. Driver Performance: Person, Earles, and Wood (2003) st udied the rate at which reaction time returned following total knee arthroplastic surgery and found that reaction time returned to the preoperative level three weeks followi ng surgery and surpassed preoperative reaction time nine weeks after surgery. Table of the Quality of Evidence Brake Response Time After Total Knee Arthro plasty: When Is It Safe for Patients to Drive? (Pierson, Earles, & Wood, 2003) Objective Compare pre- and post-operative brake response times among patients with knee surgery to determine when safe driving can resume. Level/Design Participants Repeated measure of brake reaction time among 31 individuals with total knee arthroplasty (13 bilateral, 18 unilateral). Intervention and Outcome Measurement Pre-operative and serial post-operative (3 w eeks, 6 weeks, and 9 weeks) partial task measures of break reaction time using the AAA brake reaction timer. Results Brake response time significantly improved post-operatively at 6 weeks (12.5%) and again at 9 weeks (17.5%). Results suggest resumption of driving is safe after 6 weeks. Limitations Small sample size, no control group. Other Considerations: Individuals who have undergone knee replacement surgery may be facing a period of time with compromised weight-bearing stat us or any number of co-morbid235 diagnoses. The individuals may be using prescr iption or over-the-counter medi cation to alleviate pain and therefore all medication contraindications80 should be considered, including drowsiness and medication interactions. In addition, factors other than reaction time should be considered prior to resuming driving, including pain and weight-bearing status. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 100 Recommendation: One of the following will be checked. Evidence is relatively clear and allows for a recommendation. Evidence is not so clear cut but is sugge stive and allows for a guidance statement. Evidence is either highly inconclusive or non-existent and does not suggest a specific driver licensing action. Recommendation or Guidance Statement: Heath care practitioners should use caution when considering the results of this single study in making recommendations regarding driving.

Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 133 Appendix C Alternate Viewpoint on Assessing Driver Fitness The American Diabetes Association objects to significant elements of the guidance related to diabetes. Key points raised by th e ADA that conflict with the Driver Fitness Working Group guidance include: (1) the ADA f eels that it is only necessary for those who have experienced a hypoglycemic event that require d third-party intervention (defined as requiring another person to activ ely administer a carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative ations) with in the last three months to be evaluated and monitored by the DMV; (2) the ADA believes that the guidanc e is open to too much subjectivity on the part of DMV administrators, clinicians, and drivers; (3) the ADA believes that the treating clinician is best positioned to determine whether the patient presents a driving risk; (4) the ADA feels that it is inap propriate to concl ude that hypoglycemic unawareness is always incompatible with driving; (5) the ADA f eels that relying on a specified blood glucose level in determining wh ether to issue a licen se is inappropriate; and (6) the ADA believes that the research pr esented does not adequately suggest that complications from diabetes can be appropr iately managed, and mo re recent research should be included. The DFWG did not agree with these points and maintains that the guidance provided in this document is appropriate to help driver licensing administrators in their decisions related to drivers with diab etes. Please note that the rationale for each point of guidance is included in Chapter 4. A brief description of each general concern raised by the ADA follows, paired with the DFWG reasoning for its guidance. Generally, the American Diabetes Association asserts that it is unnecessary and costly to review case information for a ll drivers with diabetes, and th at focus should instead be on those drivers who have experienced a hypoglyc emic event that required third-party intervention, as they are deemed to be at greatest risk of crash involvement. The DFWG believes it is important to evaluate and monito r all drivers with diabetes. Increased crash risk is not limited to drivers who have e xperienced a hypoglycemic event, and in fact extends to all drivers with di abetes. Periodic controls, such as the submission of medical forms that are completed by clinicians, are a reasonable means of monitoring drivers who are at increased risk of crashing. The American Diabetes Association expre sses concern about ambiguous language in the guidance. In particular, it finds statements such as \"free from hypoglycemic episodes,\" \"compliant with diabetes therapy,\" \"stable, \" and \"under control\" to be subjective, unnecessarily broad, and without definition in the diabetes medical community. The DFWG opts to keep the guidance as it is in order to meet th e needs of driver licensing administrators. The DFWG believes that th e language is appropriate to convey the meaning and intent of the guidance to a non-me dical audience. It al so believes that the language can serve as a framework around wh ich sound policy can be structured, with specific approaches to be adopted at the State level. ADA does not agree with the DFWG that all hypoglycemic unawareness is incompatible with safe driving. In support of this, ADA notes that literature shows that a two- to three- Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 134 week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycemia is enough to regain hypoglycemic awareness. In addition, ADA suggests that a person with hypoglycemia unawareness may still be safe to drive with proper precauti ons, including testing blood glucose before driving and testing at least hourly on long drives. The DFWG suggests that it is important to review the case of each pers on who may be at increased risk of a crash, and that people with hypoglycemic unawareness fall into this category. The American Diabetes Association recomme nds that the responsib ility for determining whether an individual is safe to drive be focused on the trea ting clinician rather than the DMV. The DFWG recommends that licensi ng fitness decisions remain with licensing aministrators with input from treating clinicians. The DFWG opts to provide guidance that driver licensing administrators can use in working with clinicians regarding driving safety. The relationship between the DMV a nd clinicians should be a balanced one where both parties contribute their own expertis e while respecting that of the other party. The ADA disagrees with the requirement that, in order to qualify for a license, people with diabetes must be free of a pattern of repeated episodes of hypoglycemia where their blood glucose levels are 45 mg/dL or less. The ADA believes that a requirement that the clinician certify that the indi vidual has not had an episode of hypoglycemia requiring intervention from another person is suffici ent and that relying on a specified blood glucose level as a measure of safety risk is unreliable due to in dividual differences. Finally, the American Diabetes Association beli eves that the research findings presented in Chapter 4 are incomplete, and that they inadequately state the manageability of the disease. The DFWG believes that the research findings pr esented in Chapter 4 suggest that complications from diabetes can be appropriately managed, but that the management should also include monitoring by the DMV. The American Diabetes Association also suggests that research from the last year that it published be included. From a practical perspective, this is not feasible. The DF WG suggests that available research was considered at the time of th e review and that these gui delines should be revisited periodically as new research findings become available. For further information and clarifications on these ADA positions, we encourage driver licensing administrators to contact the American Diabetes Association.

Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. These medications can cause drowsiness. 10 neuroleptics are antipsychotic drug that are used to treat mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations that indicate impaired contact with reality. 11 antidepressants are medications prescribed to relieve major depression 12 Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain diseas e of unknown cause that is the most common form of dementia. The disease usually starts in late middle age or in old age as a memory loss for recent events spreading to memories for more distant events and progressing over the course of five to ten years to a profound intellectual decline. 13 AD - Alzheimer's disease 14 hypoglycemia is low blood sugar that occurs qu ickly. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar (or blood glucose) concentrations fall below a level necessary to properly support the body's need for energy and stability throughout its cells. 15 diabetes is a disease in which the body doe s not properly use or produce enough insulin, resulting in el evated blood glucose 16 epilepsy is the common medical disorder characterized by recurrent seizures 17 seizure is a sudden alteration in behavior that may range from loss of consciousness or body control to a mild subjective feeling, due to acute abnormal brain electrical activity 18 obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially life-threat ening condition characterized by episodes of breathing cessation during sleep alternating with snoring or disordered breathing. The low levels of oxygen in the blood of patients with OSA may eventually cause heart problems or stroke. 19 OSA - obstructive sleep apnea 20 apnea hypopnea index is an index of severity that combines apneas and hypopneas. Combining them both gives an overall seve rity of sleep apnea including sleep disruptions and desaturations (a low le vel of oxygen in the blood). The apnea- Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 137 hypopnea index is calculated by dividing the number of apneas and hypopneas by the number of hours of sleep. 21 AHI - apnea hypopnea index 22 narcolepsy is a disorder marked by excessive daytime sleepiness, uncontrollable sleep attacks, and cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone, usually lasting up to half an hour) 23 stroke or cerebral vascular accident is the sudden death of some brain cells due to lack of oxygen when the blood flow to the brai n is impaired by blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain 24 traumatic brain injury is brain damage from trauma 25 contrast sensitivity refers to the amount of contrast a person needs in order to detect or identify an object or pattern, it is the visual ability to see objects that may not be outlined clearly or that do not stand out from their background. 26 Trails A and B Tests often called the Trail-Making Tests or TMT are popular tests that are recommended by the American Medical Association for older driver screening. The tests are designed to screen the cognitive functi on of an individual and monitor subjects for cognitive decline, brain injury, or cognitive impairment. The test consists of two parts; The Trail Making Test Part A, c onsisting of 25 circles numbered 1-25 and the patient has to draw lines to conn ect the numbers in ascending order and The Trail Making Test Part B, consisting of 25 circles including both numbers (1-13) and letters (A-L) and the pa tient has to draw lines to connect the circles alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc.). 27 Mini Mental Status Exam is a brief 30-point que stionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. 28 MMSE - Mini Mental Status Exam 29 insulin is a hormone that is needed to conve rt sugar, starches, and other food into energy needed for daily life 30 anti-epileptic drugs are drugs used to treat or prev ent convulsions (as in epilepsy) 31 AED - anti-epileptic drugs 32 neurological has to do with the nerv es or the nervous system 33 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is published by the American Psychiatric Association and pr ovides diagnostic criteria for mental disorders. It is used in the United Stat es and in varying degrees around the world, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers. 34 DSM-IV - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 35 continuous positive airway pressure is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. CPAP patients during sleep wear a f ace mask connected to a pump that forces air into the nasal passages at pressures high enough to overcome obstructions in the airway and stimulate normal breathing. The airway pressure delivered into the upper airway is continuous during bot h inspiration and expiration. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 138 36 CPAP - continuous positive airway pressure 37 neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that either directly, via intrinsi c muscle pathology, or indirectly, via nerve pathology, impair the functioning of the muscles 38 amputation is the absence of a limb due to a congenital limb deficiency or surgical removal of a limb following trauma or illness 39 congenital involves defects or damage to a developing fetus 40 transtibial is an amputation above th e foot but below the knee 41 rheumatoid arthritis : is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints, the tissu e around the joints, as well as other organs in the body. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body tis sues are mistakenly attacked by its own immune system. 42 RA - rheumatoid arthritis 43 osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis caused by inflammation, breakdown, and eventual loss of cartilage in the joints 44 OA - osteoarthritis 45 sciatica is pain resulting from irritation of the sciatic nerve. Sciatica pain is typically felt from the low back to behind the thigh and radiating down below the knee. The sciatic nerve is the larges t nerve in the body and begins from nerve roots in the lumbar spinal cord in the low back and extends through the buttock area to send nerve endings down the lower limb. 46 fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterize d by widespread pain, tenderness, and stiffness of muscles and associated connec tive tissue structures that is typically accompanied by fatigue, headache, and sleep disturbances 47 FM - fibromyalgia 48 ankylosing spondylitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. The sacroiliac joints are located in the low back where the sacrum (the bone directly above the tailbone) meets the iliac bones (bones on either side of the upper buttocks). Chronic inflammation in these areas causes pain and stiffness in and around the spine. Over time, chronic spinal inflammation (spondylitis) can lead to a complete cementing together (fusion) of the vertebrae, a process referred to as ankylosis. Ankylosis leads to loss of mobility of the spine. 49 AS - ankylosing spondylitis 50 in vivo means in the living organism, as oppos ed to in vitro (in the laboratory) 51 CVA - cerebral vascular accident 52 hemiparesis is weakness on one side of the body 53 paresis is slight or incomplete paralysis 54 multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological disorder of unknown origin that affects vision (double vision), cognition (p roblem solving, attention, and memory), sensation, and physical strength 55 MS - multiple sclerosis 56 MSFC - Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 57 NDT - neurocognitive driving test Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 139 58 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that characterized by tremors, rigidity, slow movements and posture instability 59 akinesia is an absence, poverty, or loss of control of voluntary muscle movements 60 tremors are an unintentional (invol untary), rhythmical alternating movement that may affect the muscles of any part of the body, which is caused by the rapid alternating contraction and relaxation of muscles and is a common symptom of diseases of the nervous system 61 dyskinesia is an impairment in the ability to control movements, characterized by spasmodic or repetitive motions or lack of coordination 62 bradykinesia is extreme slowness in movement 63 hallucinations are false or distorted sensory expe riences that appear to be real perceptions. These sensory impressions ar e generated by the mind rather than by any external stimuli, and may be seen, heard, felt, and even smelled or tasted. 64 PD - Parkinson's disease 65 The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is a rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. It is made up of the (1) mentation, behavior, and mood, (2) activit ies of daily living and (3) motor sections. These are evaluated by interview. Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity. A total of 199 points are possi ble. 199 represents the worst (total) disability, 0 represents no disability. 66 UPDRS - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 67 Webster's Rating Scale is an assessment of the sever ity of Parkinson's disease and clinical impairment against 10 items usi ng a scale of 0 = normal to 3 = maximum impairment: bradykinesia, rigidity, postur e, upper extremity swing, gait, tremor at rest, facies, seborrhoea, speech, and self care. 68 The Stroke Driver Screening Assessment (SDSA) is used to predict the driving performance of individuals following a str oke. Therapists use the set of tests to identify drivers who are unfit to drive after a stroke. This assessment consists of three tests: road-sign recognition, a concentration task, and a verbal-reasoning task. The SDSA has been used to test the cognitive abilities of patients with neurological disabilities, including dementia. 69 SDSA - Stroke Driver Screening Assessment 70 The Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery is a test of the speed of information processing in patients with multiple sclerosis 71 AMIPB - The Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery 72 msec - millisecond 73 The Hoehn and Yahr Staging Scale is a commonly used system for describing how the symptoms of Parkinson's disease progress. The scale allocates stages from 0 to 5 to indicate the relative level of disability. 74 The Finger Tapping Test is a neuropsychological test that assesses motor speed and motor control 75 neuropsychological is a discipline combining neur ology and psychology to study the relationship between the func tioning of the brain and cogni tive processe s or behavior Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 140 76 route following task is a test that measures visual and cognitive abilities that are critical to safe automobile driving. At th e beginning of the test the driver is required to recite and learn correctly a brief set of verbal directions to a destination. Then the driver is tested on the number of (a) incorrect turns, (b) times lost, and (c) at-fault safety errors during the task. 77 RFT - route following task 78 aiming task is a test in which the coordination of eye and hand movements is measured when a subject attempts to catch up with a visual target 79 The Purdue Pegboard Test has been used extensively to aid in the selection of employees for jobs that requi re fine and gross motor dext erity and coordination. It measures gross movements of hands, fingers and arms, and fingertip dexterity as necessary in assembly tasks. 80 contraindications means to indicate the inadvisa bility of something, such as a medical treatment 81 cervical pertains to the neck 82 thoracic pertains to the thorax or chest 83 lumbar pertains to the lower back 84 TBI - traumatic brain injury 85 SPI - Simulator Performance Index 86 DPI - Driver Performance Inventory 87 premorbid means occurring before development of disease 88 The Functional Independence Measure is an 18-item, seven-le vel ordinal scale. It is the product of an effort to resolve the long standing problem of lack of uniform measurement and data on disability and rehabilitation outcomes. The FIM can be completed in approximately 20-30 minutes in conference, by observation, or by telephone interview. It a ssesses areas of dysfunction in activities that commonly occur in individuals with any progressi ve, reversible or fixed neurologic, musculoskeletal and other disorders. On e limitation relative to using the FIM in evaluating survivors of TBI is that it is not diagnosis-specific. Although found to be reliable and valid, the scal e has few cognitive, behavior al, and communication related functional items relevant to assessing people with TBI. 89 FIM - Functional Independence Measure 90 The Functional Assessment Measure was developed as an adjunct to the FIM to specifically address the major functional areas that are rela tively less emphasized in the FIM, including cognitive, behavioral , communication and community functioning measures. The FAM consists of 12 items. These items do not stand alone, but are intended to be added to the 18 items of the FIM. The total 30 item scale combination is referred to as the FIM+FAM. The time required to administer the FIM+FAM is approximately 35 minutes. 91 FAM - Functional Assessment Measure 92 macular degeneration is a disease associated with aging that in its advanced stages causes a serious loss of central vision including visual acuity impairment 93 cataract refers to an increased opacification of th e lens in the eye. The lens becomes cloudy thus causing objects and patterns to look washed out , blurry, and indistinct. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 141 94 optic neuritis is a vision disorder characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve 95 glaucoma is a common eye condition in which the fluid pressure insi de the eyes rises because of slowed fluid drainage from the ey e. It causes visual field impairment and in its advanced stages it can also lead to a loss of central vision including impaired visual acuity. 96 retinitis pigmentosa refers to a group of inherited disorders that slowly lead to blindness due to abnormalities of the photoreceptors (primarily the rods) in the retina. 97 Stargardt's disease is an inherited disorder that affects children and young adults. Stargardt's generally refers to a group of inherited diseases causing light-sensitive cells in the inner back of the eye (retina) to deteriorate, pa rticularly in the area of the macula where fine focusing occurs. Centra l vision loss also occurs, while peripheral vision usually is retained. 98 diabetic retinopathy is a vascular complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes where blood vessels in the eye swell and leak or abnormal new blood vessels grow 99 optic atrophy is a degeneration of the optic nerve fibers that can lead to a loss of clarity, changes in the fi eld of vision or both 100 cornea refers to the transparent, convex, anteri or portion of the outer fibrous coat of the eyeball that covers th e iris and the pupil and is continuous with the sclera 101 amblyopi a is a disorder of the visual system that is characterized by poor or indistinct vision in an eye that is othe rwise physically normal, or out of proportion to associated structural abnormalities. It has been estimated to affect 1 to 5 percent of the population. The problem is caused by either no transmission or poor transmission of the visual image to the brain for a sust ained period of dysfunction or during early childhood 102 uncorrected refractive error is an optical defect of the eye that results in light not being focused clearly on the retina. 103 myopia or nearsightedness affect s 20 percent to 30 percent of the population, but this eye disorder is easily corrected with eyeg lasses, contact lenses or surgery. People who have myopia or nearsightedness have difficulty seeing distant objects, but can see objects that are near, clearly. 104 a bioptic telescope looks like a standard pair of glasses with a small telescope attached to the top of the frames. It is portable and light-weight, yet it automatically magnifies images to four time's normal size when looking at an object at a distance and five times normal size in close range. The bioptic telescope magnifies distant objects; drivers with th is device are taught to use their carrier lens most of the time and glance through the telescope for only a few seconds at a time to read a road sign or street name. 105 contrast refers to the light-dark transition at th e border or the edge of an image or object that defines the existen ce of a pattern or an object 106 contrast sensitivity impairment is the inability to detect or identify an object or pattern clearly. A person with contrast se nsitivity impairment sees objects as having very little distinction between boundaries. 107 preponderance is a superiority in weight, power, importance, or strength Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 142 108 central vision refers to straight-ahead vision. Cent ral vision permits a person to read, drive, and perform other activities that require fine, sharp, st raight-ahead vision. 109 peripheral vision refers to side vision. It is th e ability to see obj ects and movement outside of the direct line of vision. Peripheral vision is the work of the rods, nerve cells located largely outside the macula (the center) of the retina. The rods are also responsible for night vision and low-light vision but are insensitive to color. 110 visual field impairment is having reduced vision that constitutes a significant limitation of visual capability resulting fr om disease, trauma, or a congenital or degenerative condition that cannot be corrected by conventional means 111 color vision deficit refers to impairment in the ability to discriminate among colors, and can either be inherited, or acquired later in life 112 The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was established as a separate administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation on January 1, 2000, pursuant to the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. Its primary mission is to reduce crashes, injuries, and fataliti es involving large trucks and buses. 113 FMCSA - Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 114 slowed visual processing speed refers to a slowing in the speed at which a person processes visual information, particularly as related to recogn izing and identifying objects and patterns and making decisions about them 115 hemianopia is a visual field impairment where complete or near complete loss of light sensitivity occurs in one half of the visual fiel d on the same side in visual space 116 quadrantanopia refers to the loss of sensitivity in one-quarter (or one quadrant) of the visual field. 117 AMD - age-related macular degeneration 118 opacification is the process of becoming or rendering opaque (impervious to light rays, x-rays or other electro magnetic radiation), the rendering opaque for x-rays of a tissue or organ by introduction of a contrast medium 119 delirium is an acute and relatively sudden (d eveloping over hours to days) decline in attention-focus, perception, and cognition.

This condition progressively reduces the effectiv eness of the immune system and leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic in fections and tumors. HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membra ne or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, semen, vagi nal fluid, preseminal fluid, and breast milk. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 143 124 metabolic means relating to, or resulting from metabolism 125 hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid, develops wh en the thyroid gland fails to produce or secrete as much thyroxine as th e body needs. Because thyroxine regulates such essential functions as heart rate, digestion, physical growth, and mental development, an insufficient supply of this hormone can slow life-sustaining processes, damage organs and tissues in every part of the body, and lead to life- threatening complications. 126 psychoactive medication is a substance that effect s emotional and psychological perception in the brain 127 benzodiazepines are central nervous system depre ssant medications used to relieve nervousness, tension, and other symptoms. Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. These medications can cause drowsiness. 128 neuroleptics are antipsychotic drug that are used to treat mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations that indicate impaired contact with reality. 129 antidepressants are medications prescribed to relieve major depression 130 Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain diseas e of unknown cause that is the most common form of dementia. The disease usually starts in late middle age or in old age as a memory loss for recent events spreading to memories for more distant events and progressing over the course of five to ten years to a profound intellectual decline. 131 AD - Alzheimer's disease 132 clinical dementia rating scale is a numeric scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia 133 CDR - clinical dementia rating scale 134 visuospatial pertains to the ability to understa nd visual represen tations and their spatial relationships 135 Judgment of Line Orientation Test is a relatively pure measure of visuospatial perception, analysis, and judgment 136 JLO - Judgment of Line Orientation Test 137 block design is a subtest on many intelligence tests that tests visuospatial and motor skills. The testee is required to take blocks that have all white side s, all red sides, and red and white sides and arrange them accordi ng to a pattern. They are timed on this task and compared to a normative sample. 138 Benton Visual Retention Test or \"the Benton,\" as it is usually called, is a widely used instrument that assesses visual per ception, visual memory, and visuoconstructive abilities. Because it measures perception of spatial relations and memory for newly learned material, it is used in clinical diagnosis of brain damage and dysfunction in children and adults, as well as in research. The individual is shown 10 designs, one at a time, and asked to reproduce each one as exactly as possible on plain paper from memory. The test is untimed, and the re sults are professionally scored by form, shape, pattern, and arrangement on the paper. 139 BVRT - Benton Revised Visual Retention Test 140 Complex Figure Test is a test of visual-spatial perception/construction and memory Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 144 141 CFT - Complex Figure Test 142 Facial Recognition Test assesses memory, visual recognition, and face processing.

They work on three brain neurotransmitters in relieving depression symptoms, such as irritability and anger. 144 narcotic analgesics is a drug derived from opium or opiumlike compounds, with potent painkilling effects asso ciated with significant alteration of mood and behavior, and with the potential for dependence and to lerance following repeated administration 145 dopaminergic medications are activated or transmitted by dopamine, which is a neurochemical made in the brain that is i nvolved in many brain activities, including movement and emotion 146 Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task a measure of rate of information processing, is presented as a convenient test for estima ting individual performance during recovery of amnesia or concussions 147 PASAT - Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task 148 Controlled Oral Word Association is a kind of psychological test in which participants have to say as many words as possible from a category in a given time (usually 60 seconds). This category can be semantic, such as fruits, or phonetic, such as words that begin with the letter p 149 COWA - Controlled Oral Word Association 150 Huntington's disease is a genetic neurolog ical disorder characterized after onset by uncoordinated, jerky body movements and a dec line in some mental abilities. These characteristics vary per individual, physical ones less so, but the differing decline in mental abilities can lead to a number of pot ential behavioral problems. The disorder itself isn't fatal, but as symptoms progress, complications reducing life expectancy increase 151 The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is a neuropsychological test of \"set-shifting,\" i.e., the ability to display flexibility in the f ace of changing schedules of reinforcement. 152 WCST - Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 153 The brief visual memory test - revised is designed for use as a criterion measure of visuospatial memory within a large battery of neuropsychological te sts, as a screening measure within a brief neuropsychological battery, and as a repeat measure to document changes in neurocognitive skills over time. It has been standardized and normed for use with adults 18 to 79 years old. 154 BVMT-R - brief visual memory test - revised 155 The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test measures motivational impairment after mild head trauma 156 AVLT - Auditory Verbal Learning Test 157 Mattis Organic Mental Syndrome Screening Examination - an extensive screening exam that estimates the patient's previous level of functioning and comparing this with test results 158 MOMSSE - Mattis Organic Mental S yndrome Screening Examination Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 145 159 The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire is a brief 10-item tool that screens for the presence and degree of cognitive impairment. It was developed specifically for use with older adults. It can be admi nistered by clinicians in office and hospital settings. 160 SPMSQ - Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire 161 A randomized controlled trial is a type of scientific experiment most commonly used in testing the efficacy or effectivene ss of healthcare services (such as medicine or nursing) or health technologies (suc h as pharmaceuticals, medical devices or surgery) 162 RCT - randomized controlled trial 163 blood glucose is the main sugar that the body makes from the food in the diet. Glucose is carried through th e bloodstream to provide ener gy to all cells in the body. Cells cannot use glucose wit hout the help of insulin. 164 type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabet es. In type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. 165 type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and was previously known as juvenile diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin. 166 pre-diabetes occurs before people develop type 2 diabetes, when their blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not ye t high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes 167 gestational diabetes occurs when a pregnant woman who has never had diabetes before has high blood sugar (glu cose) levels during pregnancy 168 pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, can either be acute or chronic 169 hypoglycemic agents are any various agents that decr ease the level of glucose in the blood and are used in the treatment of diabetes 170 polyuria is a condition characterized by the passage of large volumes of urine 171 polydipsia is a medical symptom in which a pa tient drinks abnormally large amounts of fluids 172 hemorrhage is a large discharge of blood from the blood vessels 173 neuropathy is a functional disturbance or pathological change in the peripheral nervous system 174 atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque on the inside of blood vessels. It is responsible for most heart disease and is a type of hardening of the arteries 175 blood glucose awareness training (BGAT) is a psycho-educational programmatic intervention designed to improve the accuracy of patients' detection and interpretation of relevant blood glucose symptoms and other cues. BGAT has been shown to improve accuracy of overall recognition of current blood glucose levels as well as to specifically improve detection of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. 176 BGAT - blood glucose awareness training 177 M.D./D.O. - medical doctor/osteopathic doctor 178 antihyperglycemic therapy is often necessary to achieve optimal glycemic control in the management of diabetes. Orally ad ministered antihyperglycemic agents (OHAs) can be used either alone or in co mbination with other OHAs or insulin. 179 hypersomnia is an excessively long sleeping time but is normal in the waking intervals. These person may have daytime sleepiness. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 146 180 restless leg syndrome is an uncomfortable cree ping, crawling, tingling, pulling, twitching, tearing, aching, throbbing, prick ling or grabbing sensation in the calves that occurs while sitting or while lying dow n. Whatever the nature of the sensation, the result is an uncontrollable urge to relieve it by moving the legs. 181 apnea is a period of time during which brea thing stops or is markedly reduced. Apneas usually occur during sleep, and wh en they do occur, sleep is usually disrupted. Sometimes the person wakes up completely, but sometimes the person comes out of a deep level of sleep and into a more shallow level of sleep. 182 excessive daytime sleepiness is a neurological disorder in which there is a sudden recurrent uncontrollable compulsion to sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also known as narcolepsy. 183 EDS - excessive daytime sleepiness 184 hypoxia is a pathological condition in which the body as a whole or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply 185 body mass index is a measurement of the relative percentages of fat and muscle mass in the human body, in which mass in kilograms is divided by height in meters squared and the result used is an index of obesity 186 BMI - body mass index 187 polysomnograph is a polygraph performed during sleep. Physiological variables such as pulse, blood pressure, and re spiration are monitored and charted 188 PSG - polysomnograph 189 The Berlin Questionnaire , developed in 1996, includes a series of questions about risk factors for sleep apnea, including snoring behavior, wake time sleepiness or fatigue, and obesity or hypertension. 190 oropharyngeal pertains to the mouth and pharynx (throat) 191 tracheostomy surgical procedure used to create an opening into the trachea through the neck that allows the insertion of a tube to restore normal breathing 192 hypertension is high blood pressure 193 cognitive dysfunction is the loss of intellectual functions (such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily functioning 194 heart disease is any disorder that affects the heart 195 reflux esophogitis is inflammation of the lower es ophagus caused by the backflow of stomach contents 196 RDI - Respiratory Di sturbance Index 197 ESS - The Epworth sleepiness scale 198 The Epworth sleepiness scale is a questionnaire intended to measure daytime sleepiness. This can be helpfu l in diagnosing sleep disorders. 199 MSLT - The Multiple Sleep Latency Test 200 The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is a sleep disord er diagnostic tool. It is used to measure the time it takes from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep, called sleep latency. The test is based on the idea that the sleepier people are, the faster they will fall asleep. 201 MWT - Multiple Wakefulness Test Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 147 202 A Multiple Wakefulness Test is a test usually performed to check CPAP compliance or to ensure optimal treatment of sleep apn ea. A MWT is a series of four controlled sessions approximately1.5 hours apart. During the session, the patient sits upright in a darkened room and tries to remain alert. The parameters recorded will help determine the patient's level of alertness. 203 uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is a surgical resection of tissue of the mo uth to open the airway, intended to cure extreme cases of snoring. 204 febrile seizures are seizures associated with high fever, and occurr in infants and children 205 partial seizures are a type of seizure that affects only one part of the brain. Symptoms depend on which part is affected. One part of the body, or multiple body parts confined to one side of the body, may start to twitch uncontrollabl y. Partial seizures may involve head turning, eye moveme nts, lip smacking, mouth movements, drooling, rhythmic muscle contractions in a part of the body, apparently purposeful movements, abnormal numbness, tingling, a nd a crawling sensation over the skin. Partial seizures can also in clude sensory disturbances, su ch as smelling or hearing things that are not there, or having a sudden flood of emotions. Although the patient may feel confused, consciousness is not lost . Also known as a focal seizure or a local seizure. 206 simple partial seizures are a type of seizure where the patient is alert, conscious, and remembers what happened during the even t. Depending upon which area the seizure arose from in the brain, behavioral altera tions vary between a bnormal motor activity such as posturing or twitching, peculiar id eation including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (the feeling that something that should be unfamiliar has happened before), a feeling of numbness or tingling, or peculiar visual sensations such as flashing lights or even formed hallucinations. 207 complex partial seizures are a type of seizure where consciousness is impaired, and the patient cannot recall what happened 208 generalized seizures are a type of seizure (as an absence seizure or tonic-clonic seizure) that originates in both cerebral hemispheres 209 tonic-clonic seizures are a type of generalized seizur e distinguished by a sudden loss of consciousness and involuntary muscle co ntraction that lasts for a few minutes. People affected may bite their tongues, clen ch their teeth, and lose control of bodily functions such as defecation or urination. Often the patient has no memory of the event on awakening. Also called grand mal seizure. 210 post-ictal is the time following a seizure 211 tonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that last 5 to 20 seconds and are characterized by tonic (body becomes rigi d) not clonic (uncon trolled jerking) contractions. This type of seizure involv es flexion and extension of the trunk, neck, and limbs, often at night. 212 absence seizures are a type of generalized seiz ure that is marked by transient impairment or loss of consciousness, usually with a blank stare, that begins and ends abruptly (3 to 20 seconds), impairs cogn ition and awareness wit hout warning or post- ictal confusion and is usua lly unremembered afterward. Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 148 213 atypical absence seizures are a type of generalized seiz ure that last up to 30 seconds where the person will stare (as they would in any absence seizure) but often is somewhat responsive. Eye blinking or slight jerking movements of the lips may occur. This behavior can be hard to di stinguish from the person's usual behavior, especially in those with cognitive impair ment. Unlike other absence seizures, these seizures usually cannot be produced by rapid breathing. These seizures last up to 30 seconds, and include star ing, and occasional eye blinking and lip twitching 214 myoclonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure involving jerking of the muscles of the neck, trunk, shoulders, upper arms, and upper legs, while conscious 215 atonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that last up to a minute, and are comprised of sudden loss of body tone, with head nods, jaw drops, falls, and impaired consciousness 216 auras are a premonition. There is often an au ra before a migraine or a grand mal seizure. The aura, a sympto m of brain malfunction, may consist of flashing lights, a gleam of light, blurred vision, an odor, th e feeling of a breeze, numbness, weakness, or difficulty speaking. 217 prophylaxis is a measure taken for the prevention of a disease or condition 218 lidocaine is a common local anesthetic and anti arrhythmic drug. Lidocaine is used topically to relieve itching, burning and pain from skin inflammations, injected as a dental anesthetic, and in minor surgery. 219 postconcussive is a set of symptoms th at a person may experience for weeks, months, or occasionally years after a concussion, a mild form of traumatic brain injury 220 convulsive syncope is a brief loss of consciousness caused by a sudden fall of blood pressure or failure of the cardiac systole w ith convulsive movements that are milder than those seen in epilepsy. 221 amnesia is the loss of memory. 222 brain hemorrhage occurs within the brain tissue its elf. It can be caused by brain trauma, or it can occur spontaneously in hemorrhagic stroke. 223 encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the br ain. It can be caused by a bacterial infection such as bacterial meningitis sp reading directly to the brain (primary encephalitis), or may be a complication of a current infectious di sease like rabies or syphilis (secondary encephalitis). 224 meningitis is a medical condition that is caused by inflam mation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal co rd, known collectively as the meninges. The inflammation is usually caused by inf ection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms but may also arise due to ce rtain drugs, or other diseases. Meningitis is potentially life threatening due to the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; it is theref ore a medical emergency. 225 brain abscess is an abscess caused by inflamma tion and collection of infected material coming from local (ear infection, dental abscess, infection of paranasal sinuses, infection of the mastoid air cells of the temporal bone, epidural abscess) or remote (lung, heart, kidney etc.) infectious sources within the brain tissue. 226 cysticercosis is the most common parasitic infest ation of the centra l nervous system worldwide. Humans develop cysticercosis wh en they ingest eggs or larvae of the Driver Fitness Medical Guidelines 149 tapeworm Taenia solium. The eggs and larvae are usually found in fecally- contaminated water and undercooked pork. 227 anterior cruciate ligament is one of the large ligaments in the knee that crosses from the underside of the femur (the thigh bone) to the top of the tibia (the bigger bone in the lower leg).
