This is the first approval for Cosentyx in a pediatric population in the US. The Cosentyx clinical profile is supported by five years of adult data showing long-lasting efficacy and a consistent safety profile across moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis4-10. \"Treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children can be complicated, as we need to balance the ability of a treatment to provide symptom relief while considering the safety profile as the top priority,\" said John Browning, MD, FAAD, FAAP, MBA, clinical trial investigator, Adjunct Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Dermatology at the University of Texas Health, San Antonio. \"In the pediatric pivotal study, the majority of patients treated with Cosentyx were able to achieve clear or almost clear skin with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials in adults. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, Cosentyx is a welcome addition as a treatment option for families dealing with this challenging condition.\" Psoriasis is a common chronic, inflammatory condition which affects approximately 8 million Americans and 1% of children and adolescents in the US2,11. Onset is most common during adolescence, with one-third of psoriasis cases beginning in the pediatric years2,12. Psoriasis can have a negative impact on the quality of life of children, especially during their formative years13. The approved pediatric dosing for Cosentyx is 75 mg or 150 mg depending on the child's weight at the time of dosing and is administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks after an initial loading regimen1. After initial counseling and proper training in injection technique, Cosentyx can be administered by an adult caregiver outside of a healthcare provider's office via a single-dose prefilled syringe or Sensoready\u00ae pen. \"Today's FDA approval represents an important milestone for Cosentyx demonstrating our commitment to help meet the needs of pediatric plaque psoriasis patients and their families,\" said Victor Bulto, President, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. \"With more than 400,000 patients treated in over 100 countries worldwide, this expanded indication builds on the established safety and efficacy profile of Cosentyx.\" This Cosentyx approval is based on two Phase III studies evaluating the use of Cosentyx in children aged 6 to <18 years with plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in these trials was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis trials. No new safety signals were observed. The first study, which evaluated efficacy and safety, was a 52-week (236 weeks total), randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study which included 162 children six years of age and older with severe plaque psoriasis. The data showed Cosentyx reduced psoriasis severity at Week 12 compared with placebo as demonstrated by the following efficacy results by baseline weight strata for the approved doses (75mg for <50kg and 150mg for 50kg): Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 response (55% 75 mg vs 10% placebo (N=22 and N=20, respectively), 86% 150 mg and respectively), total Cosentyx total placebo (N=43 and N=41, respectively) and Investigator's Global Assessment modified 2011 (IGA) \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" skin response (32% 75 mg vs 5% placebo, 81% 150 mg vs 5% placebo, 56% total vs 5% total placebo), co-primary endpoints of the study1. The second Phase III study was a randomized open-label, 208-week trial of 84 subjects six years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis1. \"Living with psoriasis is challenging, and can be highly stressful for children and adolescents,\" said Randy Beranek, President and CEO, National Psoriasis Foundation. \"Having expanded treatment options for this patient population is a step in the right direction to help reduce the burden of plaque psoriasis.\" INDICATIONS COSENTYX\u00ae (secukinumab) is a prescription medicine used to treat: - people 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that involves large areas or many areas of the body, and who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light, alone or with systemic therapy) - adults with active psoriatic arthritis - adults with active ankylosing spondylitis - adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and objective signs of inflammation IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Do not use COSENTYX if you have had a severe allergic reaction to secukinumab or any of the other ingredients in COSENTYX.
