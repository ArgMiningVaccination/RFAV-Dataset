Although candidates should bear in mind that there are several similarities between homeopathy and Ayurveda, aspiring herbal healers and alternative medicine practitioners need to decide which form of alternative treatment will be most suitable for their needs. To make an informed choice about the sort, of course, you want to study and which college you would like to apply for if you are accepted on the course then it's best to familiarize yourself with the basic differences between these two medical systems, as this article will help to explain. Aayurvedic V/s Homeopathy Ayurveda is also a holistic form of medicine that utilizes herbal treatments to heal diseases. However, natural remedies are accompanied by dietary regimes designed with balance in mind; rich foods should be coupled with light ones and warm dishes go with cool rice to ensure the presence of all three Humors: Vata, Pitta, Kapha . This concept is vital for good health! Homeopathy is an alternative, holistic form of medicine that believes symptoms should be mitigated through a process called potentization, which introduces substances from an organic plant to an aqueous solution derived from those plants. In essence, this creation mimics the natural development of embryonic cells. Homoeopathy and Ayurveda have differences because of their ideologies and emphasis. What is Ayurveda? In English 'Ayurveda' means, as derived from its origin in Sanskrit, 'The Science of Life'. This system of healing has existed for thousands of years, although it developed its modern form in India during the Vedic period. In India, herbs, spices and minerals are used to bring about the necessary changes that prevent or cure disease. However, the primary feature of Ayurveda has always been a balancing of the whole human being. We also notice how Ayurveda advocates yoga, massage and meditation as crucial aspects of treatment - treating the mind and body in unison. While some may argue this form of treatment can take a long time to deliver results we feel it's important not to overlook Ayurveda's lack of side effects which undoubtedly increases its appeal especially among some demographics. What is Homeopathy? The term homeopathy refers to a system of alternative medicine, which was developed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann, and translates into \"similar suffering\". The principle of this medical practice is that a patient's disease can be cured by the remedies used on people who have similar symptoms and have been afflicted with similar diseases in the past. This medical practice looks at treating the \"entirety\" rather than just addressing an affected part. Homoeopathic treatment is slow but more importantly, it works without creating any side effects as well. There are three basic principles that guide this kind of medicine: - 'Like cures like' - Minimum dose - Single remedy Similarities between Homeopathy and Ayurveda Both Ayurveda and Homeopathy practice natural medicine, otherwise known as alternative medicine. Yet another connection between these two is the fact that they do not try to use pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of any illness. Instead, it's made clear that there are other more natural elements at our disposal than just modern-day medicine; And there are no random side effects from either homoeopathy or Ayurvedic medicine - unlike other medications, alternative treatments only treat a specific condition but also go beyond it and develop full-body health by improving your mental state too.
