We Treat Mind, Body, and Spirit A holistic healthcare approach using traditional medicine and integrative alternative therapies.

We believe that one must integrate the mind, body, and spirit in order to achieve the best health state possible. We take care of the \"whole\" person. It is our belief that the combination of traditional Western or Allopathic medicine as well as complementary and Integrative homeopathic treatments can result in the best possible health outcomes. We are proud to announce we received the \"2020 Best of Tallahassee Award\" in the category of Nurse Practitioners. Our Services We provide high-quality services to help you enhance your health, wellness, and natural beauty. Angela Myers, APRN After many years in the traditional healthcare system as a Registered Nurse and seeing patients getting worse instead of better, Angela Myers opted to seek a more natural approach to healing. After becoming an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN), she wanted to make a difference in chronically ill patients and knew traditional medicine alone was not working. In 1999, Angela opened The Medical Healing Center to provide Tallahassee and surrounding areas with a truly holistic approach to healthcare. A place that treats the whole person-mind, body and spirit. Where every person has individual needs and there is not a one size fits all mentality. We believe that each person should have individualized care. Our goal is to get each patient to their highest functioning state. Check out Angela Myers' latest interview with Jean Adrienne on the clinic and specifically prolozone. Fat Elimination & Muscle Building EMSCULPT NEO is the first and only non-invasive body shaping procedure that provides simultaneous fat elimination and muscle building in a combined 30-minute session. EMSCULPT NEO builds off the legacy of its predecessor, EMSCULPT, by simultaneously emitting both radio frequency and high-intensity electromagnetic energies. The end result is more fat reduction and muscle growth than any single gold-standard product, for less time and less money. Best of all, EMSCULPT NEO has broad appeal as it can treat patients up to BMI 35! Interested In Financing? Check out Cherry by clicking the button below! by clicking the button below!
