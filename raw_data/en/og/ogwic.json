Cachexia increa ses fatigue, reduces performance status, as well as quality and length of life. It is accepted that this conditi on is a result of tumor-host interactions and often activation of an inflammatory response. However, the molecular causes responsible for cachexia are still unknown. Among other malignancies, advanced stage ovarian cance r (OC) is frequently accompanied by cachexia. OC cachexia is an und erstudied condition, partly due to the clinical presentation and to the paucity of experimental models. In OC, ca chexia associate s with high le vels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6. We recently rep orted that IL-6 signaling to ST AT3 in muscle contributes directly to muscle loss in experimental cancer cachexia. However, anti-IL-6 therap ies are only partially protective against cachexia, indicating that other m ediators are involved. IL-11, an IL-6 family cytokine that binds a distinct alpha receptor (IL-11ra versus IL-6ra) and signals through the common gp130 receptor, is markedly elevated in cachectic mice bearing the C 26 tumor. Moreover, IL-11 is kno wn to cause lipolysis and reduce adipogenesis in several human cancers. Despite this, whether IL -11 plays a causal role in OC cachexia remains to be elucidated. Here w e show that IL-11 and its recep tor (IL-11R) were highly expressed in most human ovarian cancers, such as serous, mucinous, endometrioid o varian adenocarcinomas and clear cell carcinomas. This was also cons istent with previous observations reporting high IL-11R expression in several experimental OC cell lines. Similarly, IL-6 and IL-11 levels we re generally elevated in serum and ascites collected from OC patients with advanced disease. In our experi mental in vitro model, IL-11, like IL-6, induced serous (HGS) OC, showed with muscle and fat wasting and ascites fo rmation. This was also a ssociated with elevated IL-11 and IL-11R localization in ES-2 tumors, high IL-6 and IL- 1 1 l e v e l s i n s e r u m a n d a s c i t e s f l u i d s a n d increased STAT3 activation in s keletal muscle. Interestingly, m yofibers exposed to HGS-OC-conditioned medium for up to 48h underwent fiber shrinkage that was counter acted by administration of IL-6 and IL-11 neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these experimental dat a implicate for the first time IL-11 as a causal agent in muscle wasting and strongly suggest that IL-6 and IL-1 1 both play a major role in OC cachexia. Moreover, our findings contribute to establish a novel and powe rful experimental model of HGS-OC cachexia that might facilitate the advance ment of the field. Future expe riments are needed in order to validate whether modulation of IL-6 and/or IL-11 s ignaling can prevent cachexia in OC.

Using conventional two-dimensional tissue culture techniques and animal models, significant progresses have been made toward understanding PDAC. However, P DAC is still difficult to diagnosis and its survival rate is extremely low, in large part due to the limite d understanding of the complex interplay between PDAC cells and pancreatic desmop lasia. The inherent limitations associated with current in vitro and ex vivo tumor cell culture techniques prompted us to design highly defi ned and tunable biomimetic matrices for studying PDAC cell fate. We have reported bio-orthogonal hydrog els for independent control over hydrogel biophysical and biochemical pro perties. Built upon our prior wo rk, current project fo cuses on fabricating synthetic desmoplasia-mimetic mic roenvironment for examining th e influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble factors on epithelia l-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC cells. Methods: COLO-357 (provided by Dr. Murray Korc), a ine, component in the pancreatic desmoplasia, was incor porated in the gels to evaluat e the effect of integrin binding on PDAC cell growth and morphogenesis under the influence of soluble TGFbeta (0.5nM) and EGF (1nM). Cell survival and proliferation were quantified by total DNA content, Edu sta ining, and AlamarB lue reagent. staining, immuno-fluore scent staining, and confocal imaging. The expression levels of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were de tected using western blot and real time PCR. Gemcitabine was added to evaluate the drug resistance of these cells in 3D culture. Results: More than 90% of the encapsulated COLO-357 ce lls remained alive following the gelation process and the cells proliferated to form clusters with different morphology, depending on the growt h factor supplements. Specifically, cell proliferation was suppressed in the presence of TGFbeta and EGF . On the other collagen-laden hydrogels exhib ited extensive protrusions and ad opted irregular shapes when TGFbeta and EGF were added to the culture med ia. Intensive MT1-MMP expressi on was detected with the t reatment of growth factor. On the mRNA level, expression of mesenchymal mar kers (e.g., vimentin) was significantly up- regulated in 3D culture while the addition of growth factors le d to even higher vimentin expression. We also found that MT1-MMP mRNA expression was independent of collagen but was significantly up-regulated by soluble TGFbeta and EGF. COLO-357 cells encapsulated in hydroge ls exhibited drug resistance as compared to the 2D monolayer culture.

Mutations in NF1 are linked to neurofibroma tosis type 1, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and Watson syndrome.

We have prev iously shown that CD1d-mediated antigen presentation is regulated by cell signaling pathways. To study wheth er a haploinsufficiency in NF 1 would affect CD1d-mediated activation of NKT cells, we analyzed the NKT cell population as well as the f unctional expression of CD1d in Nf1+/- mice. Nf1+/- mice were found to have similar levels of NKT cells as WT litt ermates. Interestingly, CD1d expression o n B M D C s f r o m Nf1+/- mice was lower than those from WT littermates. There was also a slight, but statistically significant decrease in the splenic B220+CD1dhi population from Nf1+/- mice. in vivo significantly enhanced antitumor activity in WT but not in Nf1+/- m i c e . N K T c e l l s f r o m Nf1+/- m i c e w e r e found to be more responsive to C D1d-mediated antigen presentati on in vitro , which may partly explain the increased antitumor ac tivity observed in Nf1+/- mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that NF1 is important to CD1d expression and NKT cell activation. This is manifested in vivo in terms of enhanced antitumor activity in mice with a haploin sufficiency in NF1.

Cells in the bone microenvironment, including ost eoblasts and osteoclasts, express MET and VEGFRs and respond to HGF and VEGF. Cabozantinib (cabo) is an i nhibitor of tyrosine kinases including MET, VEGFR2, and RET. Cabo treatment in preclinical models resu lts in tumor regression and blockade of tumor invasiveness and metastasi s, and has shown clinical activ ity in patients with castra tion-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer tumors with bone metastases. To elucid ate the mechanisms underlying some of these clinical observations, the effects of cabo were studied in a hu man breast cancer bone xenograft and in a non- tumor bearing model. Female nude mice were inoculated with MDA- MB-231 cells into the left cardiac ventricle and treated with cabo (10 or 60 mg/kg/day). Treatment was initiated 13 days a fter tumor inoculation when osteolytic lesions were det ectable on x-ray, and continued for 11 days. In a non-tumor model, female nude mice (~5 weeks old) were treated with similar doses for 28 days. Tumor-bearing mice treated with cabo 60 mg/kg showed a reduction in osteolytic lesion area as measur ed by x-ray (p<0.05). Ca bo treatment at both doses reduced the intensity of p hoton emission from tumors as m easured by optical imagi using a Cathepsin analysis showed a reduc tion in tumor burden in mice treated with cabo 60 mg/kg (p<0.05). This was accompanied by re duction in osteoclast numbers at the tumor bone interface with cabo 60 mg/kg (p<0.01) and 10 mg/kg (P<0.05 ). Mice treated with cabo 60 mg/kg did not exhibit as much weight loss as vehicle-treated mice (P<0.05). M ice treated with cabo at both doses showed significantly improved survival c ompared with vehicle treated m ice (p<0.01). In non-tumor bearing mice, bone mineral density (BMD) incre ased at the tibia with cabo 60 mg/kg (p<0.001). Mic roCT data analysis showed that treatment of mice w ith cabo 60 mg/kg resulted in an increase in trabecular bone volume (TBV) the femur (p<0.001), tibia (p<0.001) and lumbar spine (p<0.05). This was accompanied by an increase in trabecular thickness (p<0.001) and connectivity density (femur trabecular spacing (p<0.001 tibia & femur), and an increase in structure model index (p<0.001). No difference w a s d e t e c t e d i n c o r t i c a l b o n e p a r a m e t e r s w i t h e i t h e r d o s e . I n c onclusion, cabo reduced osteolytic lesions, reduced tumor burden, reduced osteoclast number and improved su rvival in mice with established breast cancer bone metastases, and increased trabecular bone volume in non-tumor bearing mice. Studies to further characterize the molecular mechan isms underlying these effects are ongoing.

However less is understood about them and their regulatory mech anisms. In this study, we construct a repertoire of 1344 RBPs identifie d from several experimental st udies and present a comphrehensive analysis to understand their characteristics at a global scale. The doma in architecture of RBPs enabled us to classify them into three groups - Classical (29%), Non-classical (19%) a nd Unclassified (52%). A higher percentage of proteins with unclassified domains reveals the presence of vari ous uncharacterised motif s that can potentially bind RNA. In addition, enrichment of various unconventional sup erfamilies suggest that RBPs could form an integral part of the cellular ar chitecture. Further, RBPs were found to be highly disordered compared to non- RBPs (p<2.2e-16, Fisher's exact test), indicating a dynamic reg ulatory role of RBPs in cellular functioning. Evolutionary analysis in 62 different species showed that RBPs are highly conserved compared to non-RBPs (p<2.2e-16, Wilcox-test), reflec ting the conservation variou like mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis. The expre ssion patterns of RBPs from Human Body Map 2.0 revealed that ~60% of them are ubiquitously expressed w hile ~40% are tissue-specific. Additionally, non-classical proteins were found to be higher expressed than the classical proteins across all the tissues (p<0.001 , Wilcox test). RBPs were also seen to be highly associated with several neurologica l disorders, cancer and inflammatory diseases.

Rece nt work by many groups has demonstrated that inflammation causes alterations i n DNA methylation, microRNA ex pression, and, on a global level, histone marks. Since by definition the se epigenetic changes are mitotic ally heritable and affect gene expression, they likely play a role in establishing disease phenotypes. During c arcinogenesis, aberrant gains in promoter DNA methylation transcriptionally s ilence tumor suppressor genes, l inking DNA methylation directly to tumorigenesis. However, it is unk nown what the mechanisms of ta rgeting and initiation are for these stable disease-specific epigenetic marks. Many toxins, including those produced by bacteria, cause an increase in inflammation and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidize lipids and proteins and damage DNA by base oxidation as well as single and double strand breaks. We find t hat oxidative damage induces the formation of a large epigenetic silencing comp lex containing DNA methyltrans ferases (DNMTs) and members of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 4, including SIRT1 and EZH2. By exa mining chromatin on a genome-wide scale, we demonstrate that oxida tive damage results in the relo calization of these epigenetic silencing proteins from non-GC-rich to GC-rich areas of the genome, including CpG- islands of which some are DNA hypermethylated and silenced in ca ncer cells. This relocalizati on results in histone mark and nascent transcription changes and, speci fically at the CpG island-conta ining promoters of low expression genes, gains in DNA methylation. Furthermore, using a mouse model of inflamm ation-induced tumorigenesis, we demonstrate that, in inflamed tissue, oxidative DNA damage and enrichment of epigene tic silencing proteins occurs in CpG island-containing promoters of key genes. We are currently using this model to study the molecular progression from acute oxidative-induced chromatin ch anges to permanent epigenetic silencing events during tumorigenesis. This work uniquely links oxidative damage to genome-wi de changes in the binding of epigenetic silencing pr oteins, describing a potentia l mechanism for the in itiation of epigenetic changes in cancer. Understandi ng the mechanism of initiation an d the timing of cancer-specific epigenetic changes will allow for the rationa l development of treatments t hat reverse epigenetic cha nges after exposure to oxidative damage and therefore reduce disease.

Reza Saadatzadeh1,2 1 Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Mayo Clinic, Indianapolis, IN Email: msaadatz@iupui.edu Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) com prises the largest group of br ain tumors which are drug resistant and respond very poorly to the current therapies. In this study, we used sulforaphane (SFN), a multi-targeting agent with cancer preventive an d anti-cancer activities and sho wed that it targets GBM established cell lines, early primary cultures, and CD133+ GBM stem cells as well as in SFN at 5-50 \u00b5M triggered significant inhibition of cell survival and induced a poptotic cell death in GBM cells and CD133+ stem cells isolated from four G BM cell lines. SFN induced apopt osis in U87MG cells was associated with activation. Moreover, SFN triggered formation of intr acellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and when the cells were pre-treated with 10 mM N-acetyl cysteine (N AC), ROS production and cell survival in cells treated with 5-10 \u00b5M were similar to the control untreate d U87MG cells, revealing that SFN-triggered cell death is ROS-dependent. More over, SFN-generated ROS in U87 MG cells were formed at the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain (MRC) level. SFN also increased expression of the TRAIL receptor DR5 in GBM cells, U87MG and SF767 cells b y 24 h post-exposure. Moreove r, as revealed by comet assay, SFN increased single and double-strand DNA breaks in GBM. Compared to untreated control cells, a significantly higher amount of -H2AX foci a nd as consequence higher number o f DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) breaks were observed in the SFN-treated sample. In vivo studies , using NOD/SCID mice revealed that SFN administration via oral gavage at 100 mg/kg for 3 cycles signif icantly decreases the growth of ectopic xenografts established from the early passage primary cultures of GBM10. Our results show that SFN robustly inhibits growth of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo and induces c ell death in established cell cultures, early passage primary cultures, as well as it is effective in elimina ting GBM cancer stem cells, which play a major role in drug resistance and disease recurrence. These results s uggest that use of SFN alone or in combination with other agents, may potentially improve survival of brain tu mor patients.

Mendonca4, John J.

While synergy has bee n observed with concomitant cisplatin-IR treatment, the mechanism remain s unclear. We hypothesize that t he synergistic cytotoxicity observed with combination cisplatin-IR therapy is dependent on the formation of complex cisplatin-double strand break (DSB) lesions and that the degr ee of radiosensitization is dete rmined by the DNA repair capacity of the tumor. METHODS : Two NSCLC cell lines, H460 and A549, were used for these studie s. Cisplatin was given at varying time-points prior to and following administration of IR in order to determine sequence and schedule- dependent cytotoxicity of combination cisplatin-IR therapy. Sur vival was determined by clonogenic survival assays. DNA damage response was ev aluated by as observed by fluorescence microscopy, flow and immunoblotting at v arying time points, ranging fr om 0-24 hours. DNA damage response was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Propidium iodide staining det ermined the effects Sensitization of cultu red A549 and H460 NSCLC cells to IR is de pendent on the timing of cisplatin administration, with sensitizatio n observed only in cells treat ed with cisplatin prior to IR. An antagonistic interaction was observed when cisplatin was administered after treatment with IR (p<0.01). The morphology of -H2AX foci varied based on th e type of DNA damaging treatme nt. Cells treated with combination cisplatin-IR therapy showed di fferent nuclear immunofluorescent staining patterns depending on the time from IR treatment: early time points showed and IR-induced -H2AX foci but by 24 hours, foci were similar to that observed in IR-treated cells. Gamma H2Ax foci formation was significantly inc reased in both IR and combinatio n cisplatin-IR treated cells at early time points, while resolution of foci was delayed at 24 hours in com bination cisplatin-IR treated cells (p<0.001). This effect is not due to treatme nt-specific alterations in -H 2Ax de-phosphorylation as measured by immunoblot. The DNA damage response does not differ in cells tr eated with cisplatin-IR and IR alone, as measured by cell cycle and Chk1 and Chk2 activation. CONCLUSIONS :These data demonstrate that sensitization of NSCLC cells to IR is dependent on cisplatin tr eatment prior to IR. Persistent -H2Ax foci in combination cisplatin-IR treated NSCLC cells suggests impaired repair of DNA DSB lesions. Cisplatin-IR treatment was associated with act ivation of IR-induced downstre am damage response pathways independent of cisplatin-induced DNA damage response. This supports a mecha nism in which cisplatin-IR synergy is dependent of IR-induced DNA dam age but augmented by cisplatin t reatment. Taken together with our previous findings, this data are consistent with a model by whi ch that the repair of DNA double strand breaks, such as those induced by IR, is significantly impaired by the p resence of a closely approximated cisplatin- DNA lesion.

MM frequently involves skeleton and causes lytic bone disease. We previously reported that GFI1 is induced by MM cells in osteoblast precursors and suppresses osteoblast differentiation, which suggest that GFI1 may be a therapeutic targe t for reversing the persistent osteoblast suppression in MM bone disease. However, GFI1 in MM cells has never been studied, although GFI1 was shown to repress pro-apoptotic p53 target genes in leukemia cells. In this study, we investigated the role of GFI1 in human MM cells. First, we demonstrated that GFI1 was inhibited when H929 MM cells were treated with the pro teasome antagonist, Bortezomib down-regulated GFI1, which by cleavage of Caspa se-3. Next, using lentiviral RNA interference system, we targeted GFI1 in H929 cells and found tha t cells transduced with GFI1 shRNA showed severe growth inh ibition compared with cells trans duced with scrambled control shRNA. This phenomenon was seen in both H929 and JJN3 MM cells. Consistent with the repressive effects of GFI1 on p53 target genes, we found that p53 target genes ( PUMA , NOXA , GFI1 in H929 MM cells. Further, cleavage of was observed in cells transduced with GFI1 shRNA. modifiers such histone deacetylases (HDACs), we treated cell s with HDAC inhibitors. As we expected, inhibition of histone deacetylas es strongly induced cleavage of CNKN1A ) Taken together, our findings suggest that GFI1 plays a critical role in human MM cell survival possibly by repressing p53 target genes, and may mediate the therapeutic effects of MM drugs such as proteasome inhibitors a nd HDAC inhibitors. Our study suggest therapeutic strategies targeting GFI1 may be efficacious in the treatment of MM.

Using a murine model of human breast cancer that is metastatic to bone ( MDA-MB-231) we show skeletal muscle oxidative stress and muscle dysfunction in mice with bone metastases. Skeletal muscle weakness occurs without direct i nvolvement of tumor cells in mu scle and the tumor-bone microenvironment is a critical determinant of muscle weakness because there was no muscle weakness in the absence of bone metastasis. Tetanic calcium (Ca2+), which directly determines the force of muscle contraction, w as reduced in mice with bone metastases (4.91\u00f10.21 v. 2.28\u00f10.28;p<0.0001).

Muscle wasting reduces quality of life and decreases response to therapy. Cachexia is caused partly by elevated inf lammatory cytokines. Recently w e found that such cytokines induce sonic hedgehog (SHH) activity in muscle , which in turn leads to muscl e wasting through dual effects on progenitor cell proliferation and myofiber atrophy. Recently GDC-0449 (vis modegib), which targets the Shh pathway by inhibiting Smoothened ( Smo), became F DA approved for basal cell carcinoma. Previously we found that GDC-0449 reduced muscle wasting in experimental cancer cachexia . Here we sought to identify new approaches to blocking cachexia b y targeting the SHH pathway. U sing C2C12 myotubes, we found that treatment with SHH or a Smo agonist (SAG) induced significant a trophy (-22.35%) versus control. In contrast, Smo inhibitors (Cyclopamine, GDC-0449, and LDE-225) w ere capable of inducing hypertrophy. Furthermore, Gli1 inhibitor hypertrophy (+32.97% versus control myotubes) when compared with the Smo inhibitors. We also measured number of nuclei per myotube. SAG treatment resulted in a 14.51% decrease in nuclei per fiber versus control, while GANT61 resulted in a 32.98% increase. Thus SHH effects might be mediat ed both through effects on nuclear accretion a s w e l l a s p r o t e i n d y n a m i c s .

The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene is mutated or silenced by hypermethylation in 18-70% of sporadic breast cance rs depending on subtype;however, the molecular mechanisms downstream of APC loss in the breast remai n largely unexplored . While inactivation of APC most commonly leads to increased signaling through the W nt/-catenin pathway, there are multiple, less-investigated functions of AP C, including regulation of GSK 3-mediated signaling, proliferation, epithelial polarity, cytoskeletal organization, and DNA repair. Given that restoration of tumor suppressors is a hurdle in treating tumors arisi ng from loss of gene function, i t is critical to investig ate and understand the downstream signaling pathways inv olved in tumorigenesis. Our la boratory is particularly interested in investigating the effect of APC loss or mutation in breast canc er, and the complex Wnt-independent signaling downstream of APC loss in the breast. We previously demonstrate d that Apc mutation accelerates the mouse mammary tumor virus-Polyoma midd le T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) a dhesion kinase (FAK)/Src/JNK signaling was up-regulated and required for the enhanced proliferation and sq uamous phenotype mediated by Apc mutation. Despite the lack of Wnt/-catenin pathway activation, Apc-mutan t mammary tumor cell lines demonstrated enhanced expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), known to be important in triple-negative and inflammatory breast cancers, t wo aggressive breast cancer subtypes. While treatment with the Src inhibito r (PP2) decreases COX-2 protein expression, there is no effect on the level of phosphorylated JNK, indicating a non-linear signaling pathway. Consistent with this, treatment with an inhibitor of JNK (SP600125) has no effect on COX-2 expression. These data suggest tha t while Src activation downstream of Apc mutation enhan ces COX-2 in a Wnt-independent manner, the pathway does not travel through activation of JNK. Therefore, the mechanisms by which A pc mutation initiates this stream of events to enhance mammary tumorigenesis, and the contribution of COX-2 to the phenotypes acquired in APC- mutant breast cancer remain unclear.

IBC is characterized by the lack of primary tumor formation and the rapid accumulation of cancerous epithelial cells in the der mal lymphatic vessels. G i v e n t h a t n o r m a l epithelial cells require attach ment to the extracellular matrix ( E C M ) f o r s u r v i v a l , a c o m p r e h e n s i v e examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBC cell sur vival in the lymphatic vessels is of paramount importance to our understanding of IBC pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that in contrast to normal mammary epithelial cells, IBC cells evade SUM1 49 cells, respectively, causes decreased colony growth in soft agar and increased caspase activation follo w i n g E C M d e t a c h m e n t . E R K / M A P K signaling was found to operate downstream of ErbB2 and EGFR to protect cells from anoikis by f acilitating the formation of a protein complex containing Bim-EL, LC8, and Beclin-1. This complex form s as a result of Bim-EL phosphorylation on serine 59, and thus Bim-EL cannot localize to the mitochondr ia and cause anoikis. These results reveal a novel mechanism that could be t argeted with innovative therapeu tics to induce anoikis in IBC cells.

ETS and AP-1 represent multi-protein transcr iption factor families that have many overlapping and unique functions. Some members of both of these families are responsive to RAS/ERK signaling while others are unresponsive to signaling by this pa thway. Although some ETS/AP-1 sites have been discovered in regulatory re gions of genes that are crucial for cellular invasion, migration, and transformation, such as PLAU, matrix metalloproteases, and inte grins, these sites have not been monitored across the genome to determine if they represent a distinct cla ss of potentially oncogenic binding sites. In this study bioinformatic and genomic analyses were performed to dete rmine the landscape of genes that contain ETS/AP-1 sites and to search for genetic characteristics that d efine how these sites function in living organisms. ETS transcription factors bind to a conserved 5'-GGA (A/T)-3' motif while AP-1 proteins hetero- dimers with other AP-1 subfamily members (Jun, F o s , A T F , C R E B , a n d M A F ) , a t a conserved palindromic 5'-TGA(G/C) TCA-3' motif. Through genome-w ide pattern matching and gene ontology analysis it was determin ed that the subset of genes th at contain ETS/AP-1 sites are enriched for cell migration, cell morphogenesis, and developmental processes. Wit h the access to microarray experiments with RAS inhibition/activation on GEO, and the ability to search ope n chromatin for ETS/AP-1 binding sites from DNase-seq data on ENCODE, it was possible to correlate the resp onse of genes with ETS/AP-1 sites to the status of the RAS pathway. To identify the role of AP-1 subunit s at ETS/AP-1 sequences, we used RNA- sequencing analysis of knockdowns for various members of the Ju n subfamily. Based on this analysis it was found that ETS/AP-1 sites represent a unique subset of AP-1 tar gets where cJUN and JUNB have opposing function to JUND and regulate cell migration phenotypes.

One type of variant cell cycle is the endocycle in which cells go through alternating periods of synthesis (S) and gap (G) phases without an intervening mitosis, which leads to polyploidy. Polyploid cells are one hallmark of cancer, but the mechanisms that induce polyploidy and how they contribute to on cogenesis are not well understood. Previous work from the Calvi lab showed that Drosophila cells can be induced into the e ndocycle by treatments that perturb cell cycle progression, and that cells in the endocycle are resistant to apoptosis. Upon cessation of treatment, these polyploid cells resumed mitotic proliferation, but these mitoses we re error-prone, with markers of genomic instability a nd aneuploidy. Because many che motherapeutic agents target the cell cycle machinery, we hypothesized that some of these drugs may induce a subset of cells into an apoptotic resistant endocycle. Upon cessation of therapy, these polyploid cells may resume an error-prone mitosis leading to aneuploidy and disease progression. To test this idea we treate d MDA-MB-231 cells with multiple anti- mitotic drugs and found that some of these drugs induced polypl oidy. Of these drugs, SU6656 reproducibly induced a large fraction of the cells to have higher DNA conten t, indicative of an endocycle. Live cell imaging after drug treatment showed that cells undergo mitotic-like rou nding, but then re-flatten without completing division, resulting in large, multi-lobed nuclei. Analysis of f ixed cells in the rounded state showed cells in early but not late mitosis, suggesting that SU6656 causes a spe cific type of endocycle known as endomitosis. To ask whether cells in the endocycle could resume mitotic prol iferation, cells were synchronized, treated with drug, the drug was removed, and cell fate was analyzed by FACS, by time-lapse microscopy, and by fixed cell analysis. After drug withdrawal, polyploid MDA-MB-23 1 cells were able to resume mitotic divisions and returned to a pseudo-diploid state. Polyploid cel ls re-entered mitosis with supernumerary centrosomes and formed large mu lti-polar spindles that containe d hundreds of extra kinetochores. Upon cell division there were lagging chromosomes and chromosome bridges, suggesting that mitotic errors in these cells contribute to further aneup loidy. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of normal cell cycle progression can lead to polyploidization a nd genome instability. Cancer cel l polyploidization may represent a survival mechanism for cells in response to cancer therapies and may be a major contributor to disease relapse.

Likewise, prostatitis has been lin ked to prostate cancer develo pment and progression. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which inflam mation is regulated may provid e the foundation for novel approaches to controlling inflammation. Myeloid d e r i v e d s u p p r e s s o r c e l l s ( M D S C) are a heterogeneous population of immature cells that expand during benign and cancer-associated inflammation. MDSC bl ock T-cell immunity and promote tumor progression by helping tumors to escape antit umor immune responses. Increased metabolism of L-Arginine, through the enzymes arginase 1 (ARG1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), is well documented MDSC suppressive mechanism for contr olling T-cell respon ses. However, mechanism by which extracellular L-Arginine is transported into MDSC has not been defined. Using murine models of prostate specific infl ammation and prostate cancer, w e h a v e s h o w n t h a t M D S C a r e r e c r u i t e d t o localized inflammatory sites and tumor sites. MDSC at both site s display increased expression of cationic amino acid transporter 2 ( Cat2 ) mediates the transport of L-Arginine in MDSC and acts as an important regulator of MDS C suppressive function. MDSC that lack CAT2 have significantly reduce d suppressive ability and the abr ogation of suppressive function is due to low intracellular L-Arginine levels, which leads to the impaired ab ility of ARG1 and NOS2 to catalyze L-Arginine metabolic processes. Together, these findings suggest that MDSC are important regulators of immune responses in prostate inflammatio n and prostate cancer. CAT2 is a novel molecule that plays a critical role in regulation of MDSC suppressive function and can be utilized as a target to intervene MDSC suppressive activity in order to improve cancer therapy.

Although poorly unders tood, protein malnutrition sev erely disrupts cellular and humeral immunity. T h e s e s t u d i e s s u g g e s t p r o t e i n m a l nourishment may alter antigen presentation and the cognate interaction between T and B cells that are important for mounting host immu ne responses to tumors. At the cellular level, protein deprivation induces macroautophagy to promote survival and scavenging of molecular building blocks. Furthermore, macroautoph agy appears to play a critical role in wasting of lean muscle tissue in cancer patients suffering from cachexia. We found protein deprivation in B lymphocytes drama tically skewed antigen trafficking and MHC class II (M HCII) antigen presentation to CD 4+ T cells. The preferential presentation of epitopes derived from membrane proteins such as the B cell rece ptor (BCR), was compromised in response to protein deprivation. Instead, epitopes from antigens targeted f or capture by autophagosomes were presented at higher levels with protein depri vation. Protein deficiency did not alter the expression MHC class II proteins but did upregulate lysosomal p rotease activity. BCR surface lev els and trafficking were significantly perturbed with reduced receptor endocytosis. Macromolecular act ivation of macropinocytosis in B lymphocytes restored antigen pre sentation and BCR trafficking. These results demonstrate a key role for nutritional sensing in modulating intracellular antigen traffic king and immune recognition. Futhermore, these studies suggest alterations in autophagy may alter other endocy tic pathways. While several therapies for cancer alter the autophagy pathway, these studies bring to ligh t the affect these drugs may have on antigen presentation, a critical component of the immune response to tu mors.

Rare point mutations are of particular interest and significance in early detection of cancer predispo sition and relapse, thus a re important in finding key driver mutations. Despite o f its clinical significance, our capacity of accurately identify rare mutations are limited due to both the sequencin g technologies and the availab ility of high quality variant-calling algorithms. Here we present a combination of experimental protocol and anal ysis pipeline that can be used to accurately identify de novo somatic mutatio ns with extremely low allele fr equency. The overall st rategy includes four major components, benchmark sample design, target region amplif ication and sequencing, variant identification, and variant reca libration using machine-learnin g approaches. The benchmark sample was made by pooling DNA samples from 18 individuals with known genotype information from 1000 Genomes Project. The pooling strategy aims to max imize number of rare variants, with targeted lowest fre quency 0.005. Allele frequencies of over 30% variants in the result benchmark sample are no more than 0.01. The preliminary data showed much improved accuracy on the rare variants identificati on. For point mutations with observed frequency <=0.01, the precision is ~74% with recall ~ 55%. When observed frequency >0.025, the cumulative precision is ~ 94% with recall at ~ 93%.

Adenosine deaminases that act RNA (ADARs) are the e nzymes that catalyze adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing events. Human brain RNA is reported to have highest number of editing events. Many neurotransmitter receptors and io n channels undergo editing wit hin exonic regions, which generates a different protein that that encoded by the genome. In addition, ALU repeats in introns and untranslated regions of brain mRNAs are oft en targeted by editing events and result in altered splicing and post- transcriptional gene regulation. In this study, we identified t he single nucleotide RNA editing events in ~160 glioblastoma patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA ). We developed a robust statistical framework for comparing both RNA and DNA reads in each patient to discriminate DNA level Single- Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from A-to-I RNA level editing e vents. This framework enabled the identification of hundreds of very high confident edit sites wi th most of them found reproducible across patients. We extracted significantly editing events that were d etected in at least 25 patients resulting in the construction of a gene set of ~ 590 genes affected by the editin g in glioblastoma. Analysis of the underlying protein interaction network of this gene set allowed the identi fication of a small number of hub proteins which might contribute significantly to the rewiring the glioblastoma network. Additional analysis such as survival modelling to identify and priori tize the genes associated with editing levels and their contribution to the cancer phenotype is underway usi ng the TCGA clinical metadata.

Regulation of genomic informatio n is critical for a variety of cellular process including growth and responses to the external environment in n ormal and diseased cells. RNA P olymerase II (RNAPII) is a highly conserved enzyme responsible for transcribing the DNA template into a com plementary RNA message. A unique feature to RNAPII is its carboxy terminal domain (CTD) that extends fro m the core enzyme. This disordered \"tail\" is comprised 3-Thr 4-Ser 5-Pro 6-Ser 7. This highly conserved sequence is repeated up to 26 times in yeast and 52 times in hu mans. The CTD tail has been extensively studied over recent years due to its intrinsic role in regulati ng dynamic interactions w ith initiation factors, mRNA capping, elongation factors, termination factors, and an a ssortment of chromatin remodelers. These interactions occur modific ations of the CTD: serines 2, 5, and 7, as well as tyrosine 1 and threonine 4 can all be phosphorylated, and tyros ine 1 and threonine 4 can be glycosylated. In light of a myriad of publications describing how different CTD proteins regulate these modifications during transcription, there is controversy as to the role of CTD phosp hatases, specifically, th e phosphatase activity of RPAP2 of yeas t Rtr1). Shortly after initiation , serine 5 phosphorylation begins to decrease through the action of Rtr1/RPAP2. Several groups, including our own, have reporte d Rtr1 exhibiting phosphatase activity; however, others have not been able to obs erve phosphatase activity. Moreover, crystal structures could not reveal an apparent active site in Rtr1/RPA P2 and as a result, the phosphatase activity of this enzyme remains controversia l. To overcome this controversy we present data indicating RPAP2 is a novel phosphatase whose interaction w ith RNAPII requires the CTD inte racting domain ation, RPRD1A and 1B form a as a scaffold RPAP2 dephosphorylation of serine 5. Additionally, RPAP2 phosph atase activity was characterized in vitro on the small molecule substrate D iFMUP. We show that RPAP2 is i nhibited by divalent metal ions and known phosphatase inhibitors par tially explaining data from oth e r g r o u p s i n w h i c h R P A P 2 s h o w e d n o activity. The results from this s tudy stress the importance of understanding basic biological process since RPRD1B is an oncoprotein whose ov erexpression has been document ed in a large number of human cancers including colon, lung, and breast cancer. Therefore, understand ing the mechanism of CTD phosphatases may prove fruitful in the developmen t of cancer trea tments that tar get CTD phosphatase activity.

The spindle is composed of a dynamic array of microtubules and its ass ociated proteins that facilitate the proper attachment , alignment, and segregation of chromosomes. Interfering with microtubule dynamics blocks mitotic progression, eventually leading to apop tosis, and has been a powerful target for chemotherapeutics. However, these drugs often have significant side effects, highlighting the need for new drugs that could have the benefits of anti-microtubule agents w ith fewer side effects. One idea would be to develop drugs that target microtu bule regulators, whose activit ies are limited to dividing cells. The Kinesin- 13, MCAK, is one such regulator. MCAK uses ATP hydrolysis to ac tively depolymerize microtubules and is required for mitotic spindle assembly and to prevent erroneous kinetochore microtubule attachments to the chromosomes. Interestingly, MCAK is overexpressed in numerous c ancers including breast, lung, and gastric, and its expression can be corre lated with metastasis and poor l ong-term survival. These data indicate that development of specific MCAK inhibitors has the potential to se lectively hinder tumors overexpressing MCAK without the limiting adverse effects of anti-microtubule a gents. To begin to screen for inhibitors of MCAK, we developed two 96-well plate assays to monitor MCAK act ivity. The first is an image-based screen in which stabilized microtubules are bound to the plate and the n incubated with MCAK to induce microtubule depolymerization. A custom image- analysis algorithm was develop ed to quantify MCAK activity. This assay has a Z' of 0.6, and can readily detect two known inhibitors of MCAK. The second assay takes advantage of our recently developed FRET-based biosensor for MCAK. MCAK unde rgoes conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, which can be detected by this biosensor.

The framework includes two supportive tasks. First , we introduced a new method to construct disease-specific pathway models that are more comprehensive and better annotated than previous methods for pathway model construction. Pat hway models developed from our p rocedure are useful in retrieving drug- disease mechanisms and developing repurposing methodologies by examining opposite profiles of drugs and diseases. Second, we developed a model-driven algorithm, PETS, which is able to perform various tasks: predict uncovered drug-protein e ffects, suggest repurposing can didates by using the di sease pathway model and rank the drug candidates. By predicting unknown effects of drugs on proteins, we reveal potential drug's mechanisms on diseases. Our pathway-algorithm methodology has a pplications in personalized medicine. We suggested 5 candidate drugs for B reast Cancer ER+ repurposing a nd 8 candidate drugs for Breast Cancer ER- repurposing. We were able to figure out 17 drugs which were the rapeutic for one Breast Cancer subtype but not for the other subtype; among them several cases were suppor ted by literature. Our pathway-PETS mechanism could be further applied for drug's evaluation and pr ediction on other cancer diseases.

TGF- is a potent cytokine with diverse effects on the immune system. In a previous study, we showed that the mitogen- activated protein kinase family member, p38, is a negative regu lator of Ag presentation by CD1d. In an attempt to understand what upstr eam signals could activate p38, we found that several studies had implicated a role for TGF- in the activation of p38. Therefore, we hypoth treatment of murin e antigen presenting cells (APC) impaired Ag presentation by CD1d to murine NKT cells. However, this inhibition was not through p38 activation, as TGF--induced impairment of Ag presentation by C D1d was also observed in APCs expressing a dominant negative form of p38. We then asked whether the sign al transducing receptor regulated proteins, S m a d s 2 , 3 a n d 4 , d o w n s t r e a m e l e m e n t s o f t h e c a n o n i c a l T G F - s i gnaling pathway, contributed to the observed effects on CD1d-mediated Ag presentation. Using a lent iviral shRNA-based approach, we found that knockdown of Smads 2, 3 or 4 in AP Cs resulted in enhanced endog enous lipid Ag presentation to murine NKT cells, as compared to the ne gative control. F inally, to und erstand if TGF- has any effect on lipid Ag processing, we tested the ability of Smad 2-, 3- or 4 shRNA-exp ressing APCs to present exogenous lipid the prototypic NKT cell ligand which does not need processing) to murine NKT cells, in the presence or absence of TGF-. There was enhan ced presentation of -GalGalCer in the presence or absence of TGF- in Smad 2, 3 or 4 knocked down cel l lines compared to the control, however, -GalCer was presented to a similar extent by all the cell line s. This suggests that TGF- impairs lipid Ag processing. In marked contrast to CD1d, TGF- was found to enha nce MHC class II-mediated Ag presentation. Overall, these resu lts suggest that the canonical TGF-/Smad pathway has distinctly different effects on the regulation of antigen presentation pathways invo lved in the innate (i.e., CD1d) and adaptive (i.e., MHC class II) immune response.

Aberrant expression of one of th ese oncogenic ETS genes causes prostate adenocarcinoma in mouse models in the presence of a constitutively active PI3K pathway. In cell l ine models, expression of oncogenic ETS genes increases prostate cell migration and invasion, attributes of a ggressive disease. Thus, defining mechanisms by which oncogenic ETS contribute to prostate cancer biology is of high priority, as it may aid in identifying novel targets to treat primary as well as advanced forms of pro state cancer. Our group recently showed that over-expression of these four on cogenic ETS genes, but not othe r ETS family members, in a cell line derived from normal prostate epithelia (RWPE1), activates a specific tr anscriptional program that drives prostate cell migration. The objective of the present study is to map and cha racterize unique domains that allow these four ETS proteins, but not other ETS family members, to drive prosta te cell migration. We proposed that oncogenic ETS factors would diffe r from non-oncogenic ETS facto rs because they either have unique gene targets, or a unique transactiva tion potential. To test these p ossibilities, I attached a h eterologous activation domain (HAD) to six full length non-oncoge nic ETS proteins repr esenting the full diversity of the ETS family. Interestingly, every ETS tested was able to induce pros tate cell migration by 2 to 5 fold when fused to a HAD, compared to their respective wild-type (WT) proteins. Th is observation favors the model that all ETS proteins, when over-expressed, are able to bind gene targets th at promote cell migration, but oncogenic ETS are unique because they have a domain that allows activation of these target genes. To map these critical activation domains, I made a variety of truncations in ERG and ETV5 and tested their ability to drive prostate cell migration. Preliminary resu lts suggest that an activation domain critical for prostate cell migration is located in N-terminal portion of both ERG and ETV5 proteins. In the case of ETV5, this migration activation domain is distinct from ETV5 activ ation domains previously mapp ed by reporter assays. Fusions were then made between the N-terminus of E RG and ETV5 and the C-terminus of the non-oncogenic ETS protein FLI1. These chimeric proteins were able to induce cell migration, ind icating that the activa tion domains of ERG and ETV5 are sufficient to confer this function on a non-oncogenic ETS protein. In the future, defined minimal activation domains will help in identifying co-activators which cooperate with oncogenic ETS factors to induce gene expression program critical for prostate cell migra tion. These studies will provide oncogenic-ETS specific mechanisms to target for future drug development. Basic Science Graduate StudentPage 2 5of 12 4 Kim1,2, Mark Alber1,2, M.

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma metastasizes by shedding of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity where the y form multicellular aggregates (MCAs). These metastatic units along with single cells travel with the peritoneal fluid flow, adhere to p eritoneum, migrate through mesothelial cell layer into submesothelial matrix where in they subsequently proliferat e into secondary tumor masses. EOC progression is accompanied by an increase of E-cadherin (Ecad) expression at early stages of metastasis and abundant expression of N-cadherin (Ncad) later in the disease. The contribution of MCA dynamics to the metastatic success and role of c adherins in MCA formation, surv ival in ascitic fluid and further fate remain largely unknown. Previously, we reported striking cadherin-depe ndent differences in ce ll-cell interactions, MCA generation, ucture between mesenchymal-type DOV13 and a nd epithelial-type OvCa433 and that generated less adhesive cell clusters, loosel y conglomerated and covered by uniform microvilli. To further address the relevance of MCA formation and phenotype for EOC progression, we performed live imaging of Ecad+ and Ncad+ singl e cells and MCAs during collagen invasion process. In attempt to mimic cell/aggregate anchorage and invas ion into submesothelial matrix in ovarian cancer tumors, fluorescently tagged OvCa433 (Ecad+) and DOV13 ( N c a d + ) s i n g l e c e l l s o r O v C a 4 3 3 a n d DOV13 MCAs (generated in hanging drops) were applied on top of a 3-dimensional Rat Tail Collagen I construct inside a glass-bottom dish and traced using Nikon A1R -MP confocal microscope in reflectance mode for matrix imaging and fluo rescence mode for cell imaging. Study revealed that both Ncad+ and Ecad+ single cells retain superficial localization and penetrate into the collagen layer stri ctly within 1 single cell diameter. On the contrary, MCA application is associated with h igher invasion rate, penetration depth and degree of surrounding matrix deformation. Moreover, cohesive Nc ad+ DOV13 MCAs demonstrated considerable plasticity and inv asive behavior, attracted neighb or aggregates to form multi-aggregate conglomerates and showed clear i ntra-collagen MCA dispersal. On the other hand, loose Ecad+ OvCa433 MCAs tended to dissociate easier on top of collagen surface and behave less invasively. These preliminary data support the hypothesis that MCA dynamics is important for metastatic success and may largely depend on cadherin composition.

It usua lly remains undiagnosed until afte r the cancer has metastasized, and the resulting disseminated tumors are resistant to all forms of existing ther apeutic modalities. Until recently, therapeutic strategies have mainly focused on targeting the tumor cells the mselves. However, pancreatic tumors are characterized by a prominent stromal/fibrous reaction around th e tumor called desmoplasia, which is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the tumor bed and plays a critica l role in pancreatic cancer progression. Because of its role in cancer progressi on and invasion, stroma is an im portant therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Although some of the pharmacological base d anti-stromal drugs are shown to be therapeutically beneficial in pre -clinical studies, their effec ts are minimal in the c linic. A growing body of evidence suggests that pancrea tic stellate cells (PSCs), stroma l cells to pro-inflammatory cytoki nes/growth factors such secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, a major component in the s troma formation of PDAC. Furthermore, PSCs interact closely with cance r cells to facilitate cancer pr ogression and metastasis. miRNAs are endogenously encoded sm all non-coding RNA molecules that regulate global gene expression and are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is now well established that miRNAs play a critical role in signaling pathways associated with cancer pathogenesis and t he fibrotic process of several organs. Numerous functional studies have demonstrated the pro- and anti -tumorigenic/fibrotic activity of specific miRNAs and their therapeutic pot ential to suppress tumor growth and fibrosis. In an effort to understand the role of miRNAs in PSC-mediated PD AC-stromal expression, a known anti-fibrotic miRNA family . In our preliminary work, we observed significant loss of miR-29 in TGF-1 treated PSCs, in correlati on with an increase in pro-fibrotic mediator connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and ECM compo nent proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. TGF-1 and CTGF are known pro-fi brotic inflammatory cytokines/growth factors, and their up-regulation is well documented in PDAC and chronic pancreatitis, a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In addition, w e observed a loss of miRNA-29 in the pancreata of a PDAC mouse model which carries oncogenic KrasG12D, a frequent mutation found in >90% PDAC cases. Based on these observations, we are currently e valuating the anti-stromal prop erties of miR-29 in vitro and in vivo to target the pancreatic cancer stroma usi ng gene therapy based approache s.

Resistance to chemotherapy due t o the presence of dense desmopl astic stroma (DS) represents an important cause of PDA related mortality. The DS is comprised of active f ibroblasts and stellate cells which interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) p roteins, and protects PDA cell s from environmental stress. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2), a calcium-dependent protein which catal yzes crosslinking of ECM proteins, is highly expressed in PDA cells and also secreted in the DS. We measured TG2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 52 clinically annotated PDA sp on the tissue mi croarray noting 2~3+ TG2 expression in PDA cells of 36 specimens (69%) a nd in the DS of 44 specimens ( 84%). This led us to hypothesize that TG2 secreted from PDA cells promotes PDA progression Panc1) express decreased amount of TG2 (shTG2 tra nsfected cells) caused decrea sed proliferation of hFibroblasts compared to control (p<0.01). Likewise, culture of hFibroblasts with con ditioned media (CM) from shTG2 cells decreased hFibroblasts proliferation in comparison to control ( p=0.01). In addition, proliferation of hFibroblasts was promoted when cultured on TG2-mediated crossli nked xenograft model was c reated by injecting PDA cells +/-TG2 into the tail of pancreas. ShTG2 PDA c ell-derived tumors were smalle r (p<0.02) than controls, suggesting that TG2 promotes tumor growth. In a ddition, response to gemcitabine (Gem) was increased in esponse to chemotherap y. The mechanism by which this occurs was studied by comparing stroma composition i n tumors. Deposition of fibroblasts was decreased in shTG2 tumors (p<0.03) compared to controls, corres ponding to in vitro results. Total collagen deposition was similar between control and shTG2 tumors, but cr osslinked collagen was decreased (p<0.01) in shTG2 tumors, suggesting that secreting tumors are assoc iated with a denser this study demonstrates TG2 secreted from PDA cells plays a piv otal role in modulation of PDA microenvironment and tumor progression. Depletion of TG2 in the PDA stroma may improve response to chemotherapy in PDA patients by providing survival cues to canc er cells. Therefore, TG2 is a promising potential therapeutic targe t within the PDA stroma.

Despite tremendous amounts of informati on about the etiology of breast cancer, many questions remain unanswered. It has been demonstrated that specific subtypes of breast cance r differ in their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic and targeted therapies. The on cogenic events and signaling path ways driving these tumor subtypes are distinct. This indicates that increased knowledge of the molecu lar events defining the unique subtypes will provide opportunities for novel t herapeutic approaches tailored to fit the specific subtypes and will therefore lead to improvement in patient outcomes. The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC ) tumor suppressor is mutated or hypermethylated in 18-70% of sporadic breast cancers depending on subtype. Oncomine database analysis revealed reduced expression of APC in aggressive estro gen receptor (ER) negative breast cancers compared to ER-positive breast cancer or normal breast. Using t he ApcMin/+mouse model, we identified pre- neoplastic lesions in the breast and enhanced breast tumorigene sis in the presence of the Polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) oncogene. Apc mutation changed the tumor histopathology from solid to squamo us adenocarcinomas, resembling the highly aggressive human metapla stic breast cancer. In this model of mouse mammary tumorigenesis, these changes occurred independent of Wn t/b-catenin signaling and required activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src signaling, with a subsequent increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The applicability of th ese signaling pathways to human breast cancer remains unclear. Using the epithelial cell reprogramming assay for growing normal breast e pithelial cells, we have begun to characterize expression of cell surface markers to delineate subtypes of epi thelial cells. We have also assessed APC expression and correlated APC ex pression with ris k and well-est ablished clinical markers, such as ErbB2. Future studies will modulate APC expression in specific compart ments of breast epithelial hierarchy to accomplish our objectivesof diss ecting the molecular alteration s specifically downstream of APC loss and its role in the self-renewal and di fferentiation of breast epitheli al cells.

Al though APC is well known as a negative regulator of the Wnt/&@946;-cate nin signaling pathway, it also binds to microtubules and polarity proteins, such as Dlg and Scribble, suggesting functions in regulation of epithelial polarity and cell migration. The mammary glands of ApcMin/+ mice demonstrate mis-regulation of epithelial polarity, exhibit early neoplastic changes, and develop more aggressi ve mammary tumors when crosse d to the MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that APC knockdown in the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) model altered epit helial morphogenesis and result ed in inverted polarity in 3D culture. While restoration of the b-catenin binding domain was unable to rescue the phenotype, introduction of either full-length or a c-terminal fra gment of APC partially restored these phenotypes. The current studies investigate the Wnt-independent mechanisms by which APC regulat es these processes using the MDCK model and primary mammary ep ithelial cells isolated from ApcMin/+ mice. We hypothesize that the interaction between the c-terminal fragment and epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) plays a key role in regulating 3D morphogenesis and polarity. Interestingly, EMP2 and APC have be e n s h o w n t o r e g u l a t e F A K s i g n a l i n g , suggesting an interaction in signaling pathways. We have demons trated that the up regulation of EMP2 in APC knockdown an integrin inhibit or, eliminated the drastic cyst size changes produced by APC knockdown. In addition, preliminary studies sug gest a role for APC in cell motility as shAPC-MDCK cells exhibited increased cell migration. Future stu dies will aim to dissect the role of the c-terminal fragment of APC in regulating gene expression, cell migration, and polarity and 3D morphogenesis in MDCK cells, and to analyze the polarity and 3D phenotype of mammary epithelial cells from ApcMin/+ mice. Investigating the interac tions of APC with several target s such as those in the FAK/Src signaling pathway will help identify key pl ayers in the role of APC in Wn t-independent tu mor development.

Sharon Stack1,2 1 Chemistry & Biochemistry, University Of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 2 Harper Cancer Research Institute, Notre Dame, IN 3 School Of Medicine, University Of Missouri, Columbia, MO Email: elizabeth.loughran@gmail.com Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynecological cancer. EOC, which often goes undetected until metastatic stages of the d isease, follows a unique form o f metastasis. Tumor cells are shed from the primary tumor into the peritone al cavity. Metastasis progresses when EOC cells adhere to peritoneal tissue and invade through the surface l ayer of mesothelial cells into the submesothelial extra cellular matrix, where they anchor and proliferate. The majority of women diagnosed wi th ovarian cancer are over 60 years of age and 90% are over 40. However, the role of aging in EOC metastas is has not been studied. Additionally, peritoneal tissues are understud ied. Preliminary data on ultras tructure changes in the aged mouse peritoneum and the elevated incidence of EOC in the aged human population have led us to hypothesize that age-related changes in the peritoneum contribute to EOC progression. We aim to identify and characterize differences in peritoneal tissues of young, middle-aged and old mice and to el ucidate mechanisms for how these age-of-host differences affect various stages of EOC peritoneal metastasis.

However, resist ance to Pt-based chemotherapeutic agents has been a major limitation for succes sful treatment for many of th ese cancers, as is evident in the case of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). More than 80% of EOC patients relapse with Pt-resistant disease, where second line therapies are largel y ineffective. Cisplatin is the most commonly prescribe d Pt-based anticancer drug that cross-links DNA interfering with DNA replication, tra nscription and cell division; hence it is lethal for actively replicating cells like cancer cells. Repair of cis platin-DNA adducts occurs p rimarily via nucleotide excision ogous recombination repair (HRR) . Germline mutations in BRCA1/2 predispose women to hereditary ovarian cancers that are HRR def icient. This genetic defect can be exploited by using a chemical inhibitor that targets a protein function, making the original defect lethal for the cancerous cells. Thus, in order t o exploit the concept of synth etic lethality in Pt-based combination therapies; we have targeted the NER pathway in HRR deficient cancers, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 null ovarian cancer. Towards this end we have recently identified NER inhibitors tar geting the DNA bind ing activity of the Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A (XPA) protein, a critical compone nt of the NER pathway. XPA binding to damaged DNA duplex is essential for DNA damage recognition and v e r i f i c a t i o n i n N E R a n d h a s b e e n described as the rate-limiting step in NER-catalyzed repair. We have employed Electro phoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) to identify and characterize third-generation XPA small molecule inhibitors (SMIs). The data demonstrate a 100-fold increase in potency with IC50 values of 1\u00b5M. Analysis of the third generation inhibitors has revealed structure -activity relationships (SARs) that define the chemical and structural features necessary for interaction with X PA and cellular permeability. A nalysis of inhibitory activity against a series of DNA binding proteins indicates a range of selectivity. Addition al SARs were identified towards enhancing specificity for XPA. Since our i nhibitors were modelled against the minimal binding domain (MBD) of XPA, which is the only characterized DNA binding domain in the prote in, we will test whether our inhibitors bind to this MBD alone by an isothermal titration calorimetry assay. We have successfully cloned, expressed and purified XPA-MBD and tested its activity by fluorescence anisot ropy. Based on these in vitro findings, we will pursue cellular cytotoxic ity and sensitization to Pt treat ment in BRCA1 null and wt ovarian cancer cell lines, which will form the basis for in vivo xenograft studies in mouse models for EOC . These fundamental findings shall promise the develo pment of a chemical synthetic lethal approach, targeti ng the NER pathway in HRR deficient cancers combined with cisplatin therapy for incre ased efficacy with minimal toxicity. Basic Science Graduate StudentPage 3 2of 12 4 Purpose: Due to patient free breathing, tumor and other critical organs deform during cancer radiation treatment. The voxel to voxel mapping among the 3DCT images at different time instances will be of great help in dose calculation and trea tment verification. To address these challenges, a n iterative morphing approach has been developed to define the iso-surface feature p oints and to map the 3D volumes. Methods: To map the tumor (similarly for other critical structures) from the source 3DCT to the target 3DCT, first, the tumor iso-surfaces of both the source and target phases are aut omatically detected based on neighboring CT intensity patterns. Then, the minimized bounding boxes of the t umor on both the source and target phases are derived based on tumor iso-surfa ce. The feature points (landmar ks) on the source iso-surface are selected based on gridding on the minimized bounding box and distances t o the iso-surface. Next, for both the source and target phases, the nearest tumor iso-surface intensity and relative positions are projected to the six 2D planes of the bounding boxes. The corresponding landmarks are t hen mapped from the source to the target phase based on image template matching algorithm. Last, using a modified Shepard morphing approach, the entire tumor volume is mapped from the source phase to the targ et phase. Results: A p r o t o t y p e h a s b e e n developed and preliminary experi ments have been performed with the previously acquired 4DCT. One set of the experiments conducted where phase 0 was selected as the sou rce phase and phases 7, 8 and 9 as the target phases, respectively. On the sour ce phase, 31 landmarks were ob tained on the tumor. The landmarks mapping results were evaluated with the similarity of the image intensi ty histogram and the disp lacement of the tumor volume. For the experiment demonstrated, the average landmark i ntensity differences of the predicted and actual 3D volume were 1.09, 1.36, and 1.08 for the phase 7, 8, and 9, respectively, with the average stdev of 0.82. Conclusion: We proposed a tumor iterative mo rphing method for 3D tumor iso -surface and volume mapping from one 3DCT to another with deformation. The dose eff ects from tumor de formation will be further investigated.

In order for metastasis to occur, cells must overcome a cell death process, anoikis, which is triggered by detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Th e viability of ECM-detached cells a l s o r e q u i r e s t h e m a i n t e n a n c e o f p r o p e r metabolism through an anoikis in dependent mechanism. Previous w ork in our lab has demonstrated that overexpression of ErbB2 results in a PI(3)K/Akt-dependent mecha nism that promotes glucose uptake, leads to the neutralization of oxidative stress, and thereby facilitates the survival of ECM-detached cancer cells. These data led us to investigate whet her additional oncogenic insults could signal in a similar manner to promote survival in ECM-detached cancer cells. One oncogene of particul ar interest is Ras due to the fact that it is mutated in approximately 30% of cancers, is known to promote me tastasis, and can signal through the PI(3)K pathway. To investigate the role of Ras in the regulation of me tabolism during ECM-detachment, we engineered MCF-10A cells, a non- tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line, to express a constitutively active form of H-Ras(G12V) or K-Ras(G12V ). Our results to date indicat e that Ras signals through a PI(3) K-dependent, but Akt-independent mechanism to maintain proper m etabolism. These data elucidate a novel role for SGK-1, an alternate down stream effector of PI(3)K, in promoting metabolic maintenance in ECM- detached cancer cells. Our result s provide evidence that target ing SGK-1 in cancers harboring Ras mutations may be an effective chemotherape utic strategy to eliminate ECM- detached cancer cells.

Targeting survival proteins directly has proven problematic c linically, therefore understanding the mechanisms of their induction within DRPC cel ls may prove critical for novel blockade therapy. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), also know n as redox factor 1 (Ref-1), is upregulated and activated in human prostate cancer. Because APE1/Ref-1 has been shown to regulate the expression of survival proteins via STAT3 re duction in other cells, we sought to assess its redox function's role in drug resistant prostate cancer. Methods: We assessed the expression of APE1/Ref-1, survivin, immunoblotti ng. The effect of APE1/Ref-1 on docetaxel- resistant cells was determined by siRNA and treatment with the redox function-specific inhibitor E3330 (10, inhibition on IL-6-induced APE1 and immunoblotting. Localiz ation of APE1/Ref-1 in human prostate cancer tissue was performed by immunofluorescence and co-locali zation was performed b y co-staining with survivin, pGP130, or STAT3 -specific antibodies. Results: W e f o u n d t h a t D R P C c e l l s s h o w e d a 4 - f o l d induction of APE1/Ref-1 expression, a 12-fold induction 5.2-fold induction of Mcl-1 expression relative to paren tal prostate cancer cell line s . C o - I P s h o w e d t h a t A P E 1 / R e f - 1 i n t e r a c t s directly with STAT3 in DRPC ce lls. We found that inhibition redox function by siRNA or E3330 prevented DRPC cell growth and induced cell death, and th is treatment sensitized previously resistant cells to docetaxel. We found that IL-6 induced survivin express ion and STAT3 activity, an effect that was attenuated by E3330 and siRNA knockdown of APE1/Ref-1. We found that STAT3 inhibition reduces its direct interaction with APE1/Ref-1. Finally, we found that APE1 /Ref-1 is highly expressed in human prostate cancer and co-localizes strongly with survivin and pGP130 activ ation. Conclusions: These data indicate that DRPC cells exhibit induced surviv in and APE1/Ref-1 to docetaxel. Future studies in vivo and ultimately in clinics will determine if tar geting specifically the redox a ctivity of APE1/Ref-1 may allow for the specific targeting of drug resistance while leaving other functions of t his protein intact.

The nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is an important family o f transcription factors whose a berrant activation has been found in many types of cancer, including colo n cancer. Therefore, understandi ng the regulation of NF-kB is of ultimate importance for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study is to use a novel validation-based insertional mutagenesis (VBIM) strategy to identify novel regulators of NF- kB, and further evaluate their roles in the regulation of NF-kB signaling in colon cancer cells. We infecte d Z3 cells (293 derived cells with hyper active NF-kB activity) with VBIM virus to cause the overexpression of negative regulators of NF-kB, and then further selected the mutant ce lls with low NF-kB activity under ganciclovir (GCV) treatment. Targeted gene was then identified by using VBIM specific primers. In a prelim inary screen, we the novel b-catenin like protein ( BCLP ) gene as a negative regulator of NF-kB. Overexpression of BCLP led to decreased NF-kB activity by kB reporter assay, while knocking it down had the o pposite effect. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of BCLP in HT29 colon cancer cellsgreatly reduced both the number and t he size of colonies that were formed in a soft agar assay, while sh-RNA mediated kn ockdown of BCLP in HT29 cells resulted in an opposite effect, confirming that BCLP is a tumor suppressor in HT29 cells. Our future experiments ai m to further assess the role of BCLP in colon tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. In summary , by using the novel VBIM technique, we identified BCLP as a novel negative regulator of NF-kB. This discovery could lead to the esta blishment of BCLP as a potential biomarker and th erapeutic target in colon cance r.

Improper cont rol of gene expression can be observed in various diseases and is considered a hallmark of cancer. Recent ly, over one million inosines have been discovered in the human transcriptome. These noncanoical nucleo sides are a result of RNA editing by ADARs, a process that can regulate gene expresssion by altering the genomically encoded sequence. Throughout evolution, RNA editing has become more common and co mplex, with numerous sites of essential editing occurring in t he nervous sysytem. Loss of the editing e nzymes in model systems, such as worms, fliesand mice shows that RNA ed iting is required for normal dev elopment and proper neuronal function. Consistent with this, alterations in editing levels have been o bserved in a number of human diseases, including epilepsy, Prader-Willi syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and brain cancers. In humans, there are three ADAR family members, ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3. While ADAR1 and AD AR2 are ubiquitous, ADAR3 is specifically expressed in the n ervous system. Furthermore, A DAR1 and ADAR2 have been shown to catalyze RNA editing r eactions, while initial in vitro studies of recombinant ADAR3 have suggested that the protein lacks the ability to edit RNA. My thesis research is fo cused on understand the brain-specific function of ADAR3. Thus far, I have determined that ADAR3 exhibits both a cellular and molecular phenotype when overexpressed in human cell culture, suggesting a previously un detected functional ro le for the protein. Glioblastoma cell lines exhibit differential protein expression profiles of the human ADARs, making them an ideal system for studying interac tion between the ADARs. Using human cell lines that overexpress ADAR3. I have determined that ADAR3 affects editing levels of coding tra nscripts, such as the DNA repair enzyme NEIL1. Furthermore, ADAR3 overexpression affects proliferation and migration of neuronal cell lines, depending on the ADAR expression profile. The data suggest a dy namic interaction between the human ADARs that is tightly regulated , especially in the nervous syst em.

To further examine HOTAIR regulation, we conducted a promoter analysis using bioinformatics tools and luciferase ass ays. We identified a putative p65-NF-B binding site (906-GGGACACCCC-915) 906 bp upstream of the HOTAIR transcription start site. Treatment of A2780 cells with the NF-B activator TNF- induced HOTAIR (1 vs. assessed by Ch IP assays) at the HOTAIR promo ter. Furthermore, in A2780-cp compared to A2780, total I-B levels were reduced (P<0.05) and nuclear p65 levels were increased, indicating that endogenous activation of NF-B c ontributes to cddp resistance a nd DDR. Consistent this observation, cddp of A2780 cells increased (P<0 .05) HOTAIR expression by 5- and 16-fold at 8 and 24 hrs and decreased (P<0 .05) I-B protein levels at similar time points. Furthermore, inhibiting NF- B by either gliotoxin (5\u00b5M) or Bay-11 (3\u00b5M) completely abolish ed cddp-induced HOTAIR expression in A2780 cells, demonstrating that N F-B is a HOTAIR transcription were enriched (6- and 17- fold) in the I-B promoter at 24 and 48 hours post cddp treatm ent, and HOTAIR depletion using dsiRNA reduced the observed EZH2-H3K27me3 e n r i c h m e n t a t t h e I - B p r o m oter, demonstrating that HOTAIR recruits PRC2 complex to the I-B promoter to prolong NF-B ac tivation during cddp-induced Mouse xenograft studies with A2780 cells overexpressing HOTAIR are ongoing. The results of this study support a role for HOTAIR as a positive regulator of the NF-B pathway and PRC2 during cisplatin- induced DNA damage. We further suggest that HOTAIR may serve as a therapeutic target in cisplatin- resistant OC.

When detached from the ECM, normal ce lls will undergo apoptosis thro ugh a process known as anoikis. The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is well known to antagonize anoikis al though the precise mole cular mechanisms are not entirely known. Interestingly, we have discovered that the overexpression of ErbB2 in non-malignant mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) results in substantial aggre gation of cells that coin cides with protection from anoikis. Therefore, we were interested in understanding if these aggregates could be involved in the evasion of anoikis induction. We found that the disruption of c ell-cell contacts in ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-10A cells (using methylcellu lose or by antagonizing the for mation of adherens junctions) induces caspase activation. Furthermore, in cells that form large aggre g a t e s , E r b B 2 c a n p h y s i c a l l y i n t e r a c t w i t h E-cadherin and EGFR in a fashion that prevents the internalizat ion of EGFR and ultimately its lysosome mediated degradation. The disruption of aggregation causes the ErbB2/EGFR/E-Cadherin complex to fall apart and subsequently results in EGFR degradation in the lysos ome. This degradation of EGFR diminishes signaling through the MAPK pathway which prevents the induction of anoikis. In summary, these data suggest that oncogenic signaling through ErbB2 promotes the for mation of cellular aggregates that function to prevent EGFR from degradation and subsequently to block the ind uction of anoikis.

FLT3-ITDs are characterized by the addition of several amino ac ids in the juxtamembrane domain of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in its constitutive ac tivation, as well as the ab errant hyperactivation of STAT5. The protein tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2, has show n to interact with Tyr599 on WT FLT3, and Tyr599 is commonly duplicated i n FLT3-ITDs. We found previously that treatment of FLT3-ITD-expressing cells with the novel Shp2 phospha tase inhibitor, II-B08, result ed in reduced STAT5, suggesting promotes STAT5 activ ation dephosphorylation, and thus activation, of a STAT5-activating kinase. Based on the findings that both Src family kinases and Syk kinase have been shown to interact with STAT5 and FLT3, and that Shp2 dephosphorylation of Src enhances its kinase our is that the duplic ated Tyr599 on FLT3-ITD permits increased Shp2 recruitment, to dephosphorylate, and thus activate, Src and Syk, constitutive phosphorylation of STAT5 and leukemogenesis . To address this hypothesis, we transfected 32D cells with mutant and control constructs of FLT3 (WT-FLT3, FLT3 -ITD, and FLT3-ITD-Y599F1/2) and measured Mutation of Tyr599 Src and Syk kinases compared to WT-FLT-expre ssing cells, and, as predicted, mutation of the Tyr599 residues on FLT3- ITD corrected the hyperactivation of STAT5, Src, and Syk. findings suggest that interaction of Shp2 with FLT3-ITD Tyr599 promotes STA T5 activation via Src and Syk. Accordingly, in immunoprecipitation analysis, we found decreased S hp2, STAT5, and Src bound to FLT3 in FLT3-ITD-Y599F1/2-expressing cells compared to FLT3-ITD-expressing c ells. We next examined the eff ect and putative cooperation between a Shp2 phosphatase inhibitor inhibitor. patient AML samples, we found that FLT3-ITD+ cells are uniquely sens itive to the Shp2 phosphatase inhibitor, II-B08, implying that leukemia cells bearing FLT3-ITD mutations a re distinctly dependent on Sh p2 signaling, and suggesting that FLT3- ITD+ AML patients may benefit from Shp2 inhibitor therapy. tionally, we found an additive B08 ation of primary FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Together, our findings indicate a novel signaling relationship between the tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2, FLT3-ITD+ AML, and suggest th at targeting this pathway at multiple points may provide a novel therapeutic approach for treating patients with FLT3-ITD+ AML.

Roughly 73% of women with breast cancer at death have bone meta stases, which are incurable. Therefore, understanding what drives cancer to metastasize to bone and ide ntifying treatments that eliminate bone metastasis are essential to impr oving the survival and quality of life of these cancer patients. Currently, the methods used to study bone metastasis are limited to in vitro tissue culture models, which lack the 3-D environment of heterogeneous cell types of the bone and marrow, and to in vivo animal models, which often are limited by the confounding primary tumor burden and also ar e not applicable to rapid screening aimed at targeting bone metastases. In th is multidisciplinary project, w e use a novel bon e bioreactor to grow mouse and human bone explants, study bone metastases, and develop therapi es to help breast cancer patients. The objective of this research is to develop an experimental platfo rm using primary bone and cultured breast cancer cells to recapitulate the complex interactions between t he primary actors (tumor cells, bone, and bone marrow) during breast cancer bone metastasis and to begin to us e this platform to study therapies that reverse metastatic tumor growth in bone. Our culture system preserves t he 3-D environment and heterogeneous culture conditions within the phys iological context of an intac t bone environment and is applicable to faster screening techniques than are av ailable in current animal model s. We will use this ex vivo bone culture bioreactor to help us identify the molecular factors that predi spose some breast cancer patients to develop bone metastases and to aid in th e screenings of new drugs aimed at targeting bone metastasis. We will validate the bioreactor as a means to understand metastasis, specificall y the stages of metastatic tumor colonization, progression, and response to the rapies. We first will compare m etastatic bone growth of cultured bone metastases to in vivo mouse bone metastatic models. Later, we will use the bone bior eactor to study the effects of tumor metastasis on human bone that we will obtain from wast e products of human orthopaedic surgical procedures. If successful, our bioreactor makes it possible to study metastatic cancer progression temporally and independently from primary tu mor growth. Because this syste m is amenable for investigating bone colonization by multiple cancer types, this study also has gene ral application beyond breast cancer. Because this bioreactor utilizes human b one as well as vibrational tech nology that is currently available to patients, this study has high translational value.

In this study, we construct and investigate kidney specific regulatory (KSR) netw ork for mouse. We obtained upstream regions of genes in the mouse genome from ENSEMBL and extracted DNase I Hypersensitive sites (DHS) for 8 week mouse kidney from ENCODE project . Similarly, the position weigh t matrices (PWMs) for TF binding motifs (BMo) were extracted from JASPAR, Jolma, TRANSFAC\u00ae and mapped i n the mouse genome using FIMO. These BMo were integrated with obtained DHS signals (narrow pea k) in 5 KBs upstream regions. The resulting TFs and their targeted genes were modeled as directed interaction network comprising of 619 TFs and their corresponding 13500 target genes. We trimmed the resu lting network by only ke eping the genes that function as TFs. Resulting TF-TF ne twork (of 619 nodes) was ana lyzed to provide a holistic picture of TF-TF interactions in mouse kidney tissue while the global network wa s studied for conservation across 61 species and relevance in kidney associate d diseases. We observed that g enes related to diseases were significantly enriched in second and third laye rs in network hierarchy. Conse rvation analysis of Mouse KSR revealed >50% conservation in close relatives such as rat, human, dog, s quirrel and less conserved in invertebrates and yeast, thus elucidating network complexity increases with incre ase in kidney functionality from lower to higher species. In addition, mouse KSR was examined in its clos est relative, rat for segments of nephron \u2014 TAL (Thick ascending limb), PT (Proximal tubules), IMCD (Inner medullary collecting duct), which revealed a significant enrichment of TFs for their corresponding origina l group in mouse KSR. Further, this network was investigated in diverse model kidney diseases such as hyper tension, diabetes and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). The compendium of the network reported in thi s study can form a roadmap for increasing our understanding of the variations in regulatory wiring in kid ney diseases.

In metast atic disease, inhibiting key pr otein-protein interactions with the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) could be benefici al for developing new treatmen t modalities since this signaling pathway is a critical regulatory point in c ancer progression. Inhibition o f protein binding to the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 by Nutlin-3a can activate pro-apoptotic proteins such p73 and E2F1 as well as decrease pro- angiogenic Hif-1 . Since the DNA damaging agent carboplatin is currently being studied in clinical trials of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), our objective was to ev aluate the effects of car boplatin and Nutlin-3a in combination in TNBC in a mutant p53 background. Using a TNBC cell line TMD231derived from the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line, we performed combinat ion studies using different ratios of carboplatin to Nutlin-3a in vitro to evaluate the range of carboplatin-media ted DNA damage requi red to obtain synergism with inhibition of MDM 2 function. A fixed ratio of 1: 1 carboplatin:Nutlin-3a was strongly synergistic with a combination index of <0.5. In cell prolifera tion assays there was incr eased sensitivity to the drugs when given in combination (p<0.05).TMD231 cells implanted into the mammary fat pad of NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice showed enhanced tumor growth, and me tastasis was evident in the lungs.

Following Nutlin-3 a and carboplatin combination treatment in vivo, there was a statistically significant reduction in tumor volu me and lung metastases compared to vehicle and single drug treated mice (p<0.001). Following Kaplan-Meier analysis, the combination treated mice had a significant increase in survival, (54.3 \u00f1 1.5 days) compared to the vehicle (39.3 \u00f1 0.6 days) and each single drug (Nutlin-3a: 39\u00f11 tin: 47.5 \u00f1 1.8 days) (p<0.00 1 ) .

The IL-1/IGF-1 signaling pathwa y is known to induce epithelial cell expansion in prostate development, reactive hyperplasia, and prostate cancer, but the mechanisms a nd cell types expanded within the epithelium are unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if survi vin, a known survival and proliferative factor in prostate cancer, is involved in a specialized protected stem ce ll population that expands in response to prostatic inflammation. We init iated inflammatory reactive hype rplasia in mice using our bacterially-induced acute inflammation model, harves ting daily for 5 days after inf lammation initiation; these were compared to non-inflamed control prostates. We counted previously character ized prostate epithelial progenitor cells (PEPCs) by their characteristic CD133+/Sca-1+/CD44+/CD117+/Lin- pattern by flow cytometry. We quantified survivin expression in inflamed prostates with both immunofluor escence and immunoblotting. We then expression of survivin in PEPCs by immunofluores cence post-sorting. Fin ally, the of inflammation-driven survivin- PEPC expansion was d survivin expression as described above. O ur data showed that inflammatio n induces PEPC expansion 6-fold in the prostate, increasing the percent of PEPCs within the epithelium from 0.2% to 1.2%. Simultaneously, survivin was up-regulated 5-fold as measured by western, and IF showed t hat survivin express ion was increased gradually throughout the inflammatory period, as it was express ed in less than 1% of cells (exclusively basal) in control prostates but increased to 15% of the epithelium by day 2, and 50% of the epithelium by day 5, suggesting that it is preferent ially the survivin-positive frac tion of cells that reactive Survivin was expressed in 44% of PEPCs so by flow cytometry, but only 15% of non PEPC epithelial cells. Finally, pretreatment of inflamed mice w ith the IGF antagonist PPP attenuated both PEPC expansion and the survivin-percent fraction by 50%, and in flammation in IL-1R1(-/-) completely attenuated the inflammation indu ced effects in this study. Our data indicate that inflammation induces the expansion of a specialized survivin-expressing progenitor cell population in the prostate. Our data further indicate that this expansion is d ependent upon the IL-1/IGF-1 s ignaling loop described in prostate development and reactive hyperplasia. Given the importance of s urvivin to cancer cell survival, our data may lead to a better understanding of how inflammation promotes can cer growth, and how prost ate cancer cells are able to survive the toxi c events of inflammation.

However, the ability of CAFs to re gulate anoikis, detachment-in duced cell death, has yet to be investigated. Here, we describe a novel role for CAFs in blocking anoikis in multiple cell lines, fac ilitating luminal filling in 3D cell culture, and promotin g anchorage-independent growth. In addition, we have discovered a novel mechanism underlying anoikis inhi bition. We demonstrate that CA Fs secrete elevated quantities of IGFBPs that are both necessary for CAF-mediated anoikis inhibition and sufficient to block anoikis in the absence of CAFs. Furthermore, our data reveal a unique anti-apoptotic mech anism for IGFBPs: the stabilization of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. In aggregate, these data reveal a novel role for CAFs in promoting cell survival during detachment and unveil an a dditional mechanism by which t he tumor microenvironment contributes to cancer progression. These results also identify IGFBPs as poten tial targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutics designed to e liminate detached cancer cells.

Here, we map gene expression data from RNAseq and mi croarray technologies from 11 cancer types at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) onto the structural pro teome to identify di fferentially expressed genes with druggable pockets on their protein products. We clas sify these pockets by annotating their role in enzymatic processes or at protein- protein interaction (PPI) int erfaces. In addition, we explore the impact of these proteins in signaling pathwa ys by integrating them onto 2 1 cancer-related pathways in KEGG. We also overlaid these proteins onto a h uman PPI network by integrating data from seven major interaction databases to identify highly connected pro teins implicated in these indiv idual cancers. Finally, druggable pockets were identified among proteins in the urokinase receptor subnetwork. Thus, these structural and network analyses reveal putative druggable binding sites for drug development in various cancers.

CD166 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily capable of mediating both homophilic and heterophilic interacti ons. Accumulative evidence shows that CD166 is pathologically correlate d with disease progression in a variety of cancers including melanoma and breast cancer. However, whether CD166 is involved in MM and how it mediates myeloma disease progression have not been addressed. Studies from our laboratory demonstrat e that both MM primary cells and cell lines express CD166. The aims of this study were to elucidate the rol e of CD166 in MM cell trafficking to the BM and in MM disease progression. H929-GFP MM cells were injected intravenously into NSG mice and BM- homed GFP cells were analyzed 14hr later. The frequency of CD16 6+ cells contained in BM-homed H929 cells was significantly higher co mpared to that in total H929 c ells prior to injection, suggesting that CD166 plays a critical role in directing homing of MM cells to the BM . When we knocked down (KD) CD166 expression cells with shRNA, the number of BM-homed GFP cells was significantly decreased for CD166KD cells compared to mo ck control. We then compared MM progression in NSG mice injected with mock control or CD166 KD H929 cells. Mice receiving contro l cells showed more rapid disease progression than those receiving CD166KD cells as evidenced by higher serum human IgA (kappa) levels and shortened survival. We next examined the potential role of CD16 6 in osteolytic lesions using a novel Ex Vivo Organ Culture Assay (EVOCA) in w hich MM cells were co-cultured over calvarias from 10d-old mice for 7 days. EVOCA data showed that os teolytic lesions were substantia lly reduced when CD166 was absent on either MM (CD166- fraction) or osteoblast lineage cells (calvar ias from CD166-/- mice). Furthermore, co- culturing CD166+ or CD166- H929 cells bone marrow stromal (BMSC) from WT or CD166-/- mice revealed that mRNA levels of RA NKL were decreased when CD166 is absent on either MM or stromal cells while those of OPG, an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, were no t altered. This resulted in decreased RANKL/OPG ratios in cultures containing a CD166- component sugg esting reduced MM-induced osteoclastogenesis in the absence of CD166. Together, these res ults suggest that CD166 plays an important role in homing and retention of MM cells in the BM and promotes MM disease progression as well as bone- lytic disease and that CD166 may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of MM.

High mortality rates in sepsis (200,0 00/yr in the USA) are associate d with the host's failure to eradicate pathogens due to the lack of neutrophils, excessive pro-inflammatory cyto kines, tissue damage and multiple organ failure. While most studies have focused on the late consequenc es of sepsis, little is k nown about the changes occurring in the bone marrow (BM) at early stages of hematopoie sis and how they affect the hematopoietic response to bacterial infection. Using an animal model of sever e sepsis induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which closely recapitulate letha l sepsis in burn patients, we h ave previously reported that HSC undergo a significant expansion in the BM associated with a block of myel oid differentiation. Furthermore, we found that expanded HSC were unable to generate the downstream progen itors (common myeloid progenitors and granulocytes/monocytes progenitors ) produce neutro phils, and had redu ced self-renewal. All these effects were TLR4-dependent. TLR4 is activated by bacteri al LPS and signal through two major pathways: TRIF-dependent and MyD88-dependent. In this study, we show the different contribution of the TLR4-TRIF and the TLR4-MyD88-dependent pathways to the BM respo nse Pseudomonas LPS challenge conducted TRIF -null and MyD88-null mice demon strated that TRIF is involved in the expansion of the HSC pool, but does not play a major role in th e myelosuppression, whereas MyD88 activation was required for LPS- induced myeloid suppression. Mo reover, we observed that the impaired engraftment at long-term observe d in wild-type LPS-challenged H SC during transplantation was rescued by MyD88 loss of function. Taken together, our results indicate a distinct role of theTLR4-TRIF and -MyD88 pathways in the regulation of t he primitive stem/progenitor poo l during sepsis and provide insights for a better understanding of the molecular m echanisms leading to neutropeni a.

Early interference and dietary prevention are crucial in PCa pa tient care. Primary dietary uns aturated fatty acids (UFAs) have diverse regulatory functions. N-3 FAs, which are major components of fi sh oil (FO), are believed to be anti- inflammatory and anti-prolifera tive. The intake of n-3 FA in mo dern life styles is low and epidemiologic studies show that high n-6/n-3 ratio is associated with higher PCa risk. N-3 FAs have been reported to induce cell death in combination with c hemo/radiation therapies by sen sitizing cancer cells. Moreover, Oleic acid (OA), an n-9 FA, also known as one of the main components of co oking oil, may also have anti-tumorigenic effects though the conclusions are controversial. Our current s tudy evaluated the regulatory role of FO and OA on PCa cells and sought to discover the global protein level changes with FA treatment. To address the function of FO and OA, cytotoxici ty and colony formation assays were carried out and results showed FO and not OA suppress cell viability and growth. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a known oncoprotein was knocked down in PCa cell line, then expression levels of several enzyme s involved in UFA metabolism were measured by quantitative PCR and/or weste rn blot. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2 ), an inflammatory molecule, which plays important role in PCa was found to be downregulated when FASN i s depleted. FASN activity assay results showed that both FO and OA inhibit FASN activity, and OA was am ore potent FASN inhibitor than FO. This result suggests the cell death inducing effects might be FASN i ndependent. To further study the underlying molecular mechanism of FO actio n, an LC/MS-based label-free glo bal protein quantification experiment was carried out to measure the differential protein expression in P C3 with different FA trea tment through different periods of time. Significantly changed proteins were selected. In day 1 group, sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1), which is required by autophagy, was found to be expressed at a higher level in FO treated group compared to control and OA treated group, suggesting that autophagy may pla y an important role in FO induced cell death. In day 6 group, proteins with significant expression change wer e searched in the Protein Atlas and UniProt data base for those related to cancer, prostate, or lipid proce ssing. Candidates will be further validated by biochemical methods. Overall, Ou r study connects FASN and COX2 directly, and provides useful information to help understand regulatory effe cts of different dietary FAs on PCa.

However, the extent and biological effects of estrogen-induced alternati ve splicing remain unclear. Moreover, whether and how estrogen-induced alternat ive splicing change with time is still unknown. In this study, we implemented an RNA sequencing assay on estrogen treated MCF7 ce ll line, which captures the MFC7 transcriptomes 0, 1 and 24 hours after estrogen treatment. We i dentified 650 genes diff erentially spliced after 1 hour and 610 after 24 hours. Only 150 genes are uniformly spl iced on both time points. We interpreted the biological effects of these alt ernative splicing events from tw o aspects, 1) the functions of differentially spliced genes and 2) the biochemical features of the peptide en coded by the alternative spliced region, including post translational modi fication, protein disorder, Pf am domains and protein-protein interaction. We confirmed that estrogen can induc e alternative splicing change on a broad range of genes, and the changes are progressive relative to time. The se splicing changes may influe nce protein functions via inclusion/exclusion of protein binding sites and struct ural units on the alternative r egions.

While constitutive activation of STAT5 is a hallmark of FLT3-ITD-induced leukemia, cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Shp2 and phos pho-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) have also been found to promote STAT5 activation. Studies have clarified that tyrosine (Y) 768, 955, and 969 within WT FLT3 recruit the adaptor proteins Grb2, Gab2, and the regulator y subunit of PI3K, p85a, and that mutation of these residues from tyrosine (Y) to phenylalnine (F) results in reduced phopho-Akt levels. Since Shp2 has been shown to participate in pro tein complexes containing Gab2 and p85a in WT-FLT3 cells, we hypothesized that Shp2 may interact with FLT3-ITD via protein complexes at Y768, 955, and/or 969 and that Shp2 and PI3K work cooperatively to promote FLT3-ITD-induced le ukemogeneis. To examine this hypothesis, tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y to F) mutations were m ade at the 768, 955, or 969 residues of N51- FLT3, cloned into the retroviral vector pMSCV, and transfected into the murine cell line 32D. Thymidine incorporation revealed a significant decrease in hyperprolifera tion induced by N51-FLT3 when the 768 residue was mutated to phenyla lanine (N51-FLT3-Y768F), and a mo derate decrease in p roliferation with mutations at 955 or 969 (N51-FLT3 -Y955F or Y969F). Consistently , in immunoblot assays, we observed a significant reduction in p-ERK and p-FLT3 levels in the N51-FLT 3 Y768F-expressing cells, and moderate reduction in Y955F and Y969F ce lls compared to N51-FLT3 express ing cells. Levels of p-STAT5 were unchanged or slightly elevated in the Y768, Y955, and Y969 expr essing cells compared to N51-FLT3 expressing cells. A possible mechanistic explanation for select ive reduction of p-ERK levels is through decreased recruitment of GRB2, w hich normally participates son of sevenless, SOS, to activate RAS to its GTP form and follow the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Therefor e, decreased recruitment of GRB2 could result in decrease d levels of p-ERK. Furthermore, pharmac ologic inhibition cells showed decreased proli feration, with an additive effect when used in combination. These data suggest that the Y768 residue p lays an important role in p-ERK signaling in N51-FLT3 cells, and that py with Shp2 a nd PI3K inhibitors provide a novel treatment approach for FLT3-ITD positive AML. For future direct i o n s , w e p l a n t o p e r f o r m a s y n g e n e i c transplant using C3H/HeJ mice, injecting them with either WT-FL T3, N51-FLT3, N51-Y768F, N51-Y955F, or N51-Y969F cells to determine the effect on overall survival. Also, we plan to perform a similar transplant involving WT-FLT3 or N51-FLT3 cells, followed by treatment with Shp2 inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor, or a combination to determine the effect on overall survival.

In this study, we identified temporal sequence of telomere dynamics by analyzing telomere length, telomerase activity, telomere fusion, and hotspot mutations in oncogenes ( KRAS or BRAF ) and a tumor suppressor gene (TP53 ) in tissue samples obtained fr om 18 colon cancer patients. We show that the extent of mean telomere attrition increases with lymph node invasiveness of tumors, imp lying that mean telomere shortening correlates with colon cancer progression rega rdless of telomerase activati on. Telomerase activity is relatively higher in most cancer tissues with mutation(s) in KRAS o r BRAF and/or TP53 compared to those without hotspot mutations, suggesting that telomerase could fully activate at t he late stage of colon cancer development. Importantly, our results reveal that both the deficiency of p53 and the shortening of mean telomere length are unnecessary for producing telome re fusions in colon tissue. In addition, BRAF-V600E mutation is rarely associated with telomere fusion i n colon cancer, agreeing with the current evidence that the BRAF-V600E mutation is not involved in genomic instability but in high mic rosatellite instability and/or aberrant DNA CpG island hypermethylation. In some c ases, telomere fusion and/or aneuploid DNA was observed even in tissue adjacent to cancerous lesion, su ggesting that genomic instabili ty is initiated in pathologically non-cancerous lesions. Interestingly, the maj ority of telomere fusion junctio ns in colon cancer appear to be a chromatid-type containing chromosome 7q or 12q. Taken together, this careful c orrelative study not only supports the concept that telomere fusion presents in the early stages of cancer pri or to TP53/KRAS mutations, critical mean telomere shortening, and telomera se activation, but also provid es additional insights that targeting key telomere fusion junctions may h ave significant implications for colon cancer diagnostics.

T h e c r i t i c a l c e llular processes and underlying molecular mechanisms that define this ma lignancy remain poorly understood . Using a syngeneic murine model, we investigated the changes that ac companied the progression to in creased aggressiveness induced by in vivo passage of mouse EOC cells. We fo und that enhanced anoikis resi stance was a key cellular process associated with greater aggressiveness and tumorigenicity in vivo . Biochemical studies revealed that the enhanced anoikis resistance was associated with the activation of the Sr c/Akt/Erk signaling pathway. A higher rate of metabolism and autophagy were als o associated with increased an oikis resistance. Blocking these pathways with specific inhibitors and/or g enetic modifications significa ntly increased anoikis in vitro and inhibited tumor development in vivo . In addition, we demonstrated tha t similar signaling pathways were also involved in a human EOC cell line model. C ollectively, our data suggest that anoikis resistance represents a critical and a distinguishing feature underly ing the aggressiveness of ovari an cancer cells.

We now report that a critical epigenetic regulator miR-205 is repressed by Jagged1, a ligand shown to be secreted from the tumor stroma to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. Loss of miR-205 in mamm ary epithelial cells leads to epithelial- mesenchymal transition, disrupted epithelial cell polarity, and enhanced symmetric division to expand the stem cell population. Furthermore , mice deficient in miR-205 sp ontaneously develop mammary lesions, and activation of miR-205 significan tly diminishes the breast cance r stemness. These data provide the first evidence linking the microenvironment and microRNA regulation t o the disrupted epithelial polarity and aberrant stem cell division, leading to an expansion of the ste m cell population and tumorigenesis. Together, this study elucidates a new role for miR-205 in regulation of s tem cell fate, providing a promising therapeutic target for eradicating the genesis of breast cancer.

Thus targeting novel si gnaling molecules in Flt3ITD pa thways remain a viable therapeutic option. Amongst various pathways downstream of Flt3ITD, the role of Sta t5 has been extensively studied. However, the mechanism behind the translocation of active Stat5 into the nucleus of cells bearing Flt3ITD mutation to induce transformation remains un clear. Here we provide in vitro and in vivo pharmacological, biochemical and genetic evidence to demonstr ate that a FAK/Tiam1-Rac1/PAK1 signaling axis plays an essential role in Flt3ITD induced AML. We observed hyperactivation of FAK in Flt3 ITD expressing leukemic cells and human AML patient samples, and also activation of Rac1 downstre am of FAK that was downregulated upon treatment with FAK inhibitors. We next ascertained the underlyi ng mechanism of FAK mediated activation of Rac1 in Flt3ITD expressing cells and observed RacGEF Tiam1 to b e hyperactive in Flt3ITD bearing cells, which was downregulated upon pharmacological inhibition of FAK. More importantly, expression of Flt3ITD in Rac1-/- or FAK-/- deficient bone marrow cells, showed inhibition of Stat5 activat ion and its failure to translocate into the nucleus. Similar results were also observe d upon shRNA mediated knockdown of Tiam1. To determine a downstream effector from Rac1, we observed an es sential role of kinase 1 (PAK1), where shRNA mediated knockdown of PAK1 not only inhibit ed the nuclear translocation of Stat5, it a l s o s i g n i f i c a n t l y d e l a y e d t h e o n s e t o f A M L i n v i v o , w h i l e i n h i bition of PAK2, showed no such effect. Finally, inhibition of FAK, Tiam1 and PAK1 significantly delaye d the onset of AML in the in vivo mouse models along with repression of S tat5 responsive genes involved in survival of leukemic cells. Overall our study indicate an essential role of FAK/Tiam1-Rac1/PAK1 signali ng axis in Flt3ITD mediated proliferation, survival and leukemogenesis; and also demonstrates a novel mech anistic role of FAK, Tiam1 and PAK1 in translocating active Stat5 into the nucleus to induce leukemoge nic transformation.

Signaling between cancer-associa ted fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor are important i n t h e f i b r o t i c p h e n o t y p e a n d m e t a s t a t i c s p r e a d . T h u s , t h e r e i s a critical need to understand the signaling within the cells of the tumor mi croenvironment (TME) and how it contributes to progression of the disease and resistance to treatment. A novel PDAC microenvironment targ et, AP endonuclease/Redox factor-1 (Ref-1), involved in th e transcriptional regula tion of gene expression. Regulation of transcription fact ors, HIF-1a, NF-kB, and STAT3, by Ref-1 and are activated in stromal cells as well as pancreatic tumors. The central hypothesis is that Ref-1 redox activity plays a critical role in the signaling between the tumor microenvironment and tumor. The objective of this work is to determine the outcome of inhibiting Ref-1 in CAFs and the effects of that inh ibition on proliferation and migration in PDAC. We are using several innova tive methods to probe the tumo r-CAF interaction including: 1) co-culture 2 D a n d 3 D m o d e l s ; 2 ) g e n e t i c a p p r o a c h v i a s i R N A t o R e f - 1 ; 3 ) p h armacologic approach via a well- established small molecule inhib itor of Ref-1 redox activity, E 3330; and 4) vivo mouse experiments with tumor-CAF co-injection. Our fi ndings indicate that inhibition o f Ref-1 is more effective in CAFs than tumor cells with nominal effect on norm al fibroblasts. Furthermore, c o-cultures of patient derived cells with normal fibroblasts do not show sensitiv ity to Ref-1 inhibition, in con trast to tumor-CAF co- cultures. Utilizing siRNA to reduce the levels of Ref-1 pro tein in the CAFs results in a decrease in the size and proliferation of 3D colonies that contain tumor cells plus CAFs that express ~80% r educed levels of Ref-1 protein. These data implicate the redox activity of Ref-1 and its regulation of cri tical transcription factors as significant in the signaling between the tumor and t he CAFs. We are also investiga ting the effects of targeting STAT3 in the co- cultures based on our published data demonstrating that Ref-1 c an activate STAT3 DNA binding and that dual targeting of Ref-1 and STAT3 is s ynthetic lethal to PDAC cells. Similar to Ref-1 inhibition, targeting of STAT3 is significant in the CAFs c ompared to normal fibroblasts . However, Gemcitabine treatment not kill PDAC cells in co-culture with CAFs in contr ast to what we observe with Ref-1 or STAT3 targeting. Due to PDAC's fibrotic of tumor-stroma Ref-1 inhibition is a promising avenue for combinati on treatment. The importance of not only targeting the tumor is clear, therefore, novel approaches that target the TME in addition to signaling pathways within the tumor may offer the most promise against this dreaded disease.

Approximately 70% of patients with R CC will develop recurre nce after surgical resection, and 25%-30% of patients will eventually progress to distant metastasis. Honokiol is a small- molecule polyphenol isolated fro m the genus Magnolia, which has been shown to be a potential anticancer agent in multiple facets of signal transduction. We have demons trated that honokiol inhibited proliferation of RCC cells 786-0 and A498 without affecting cell viability. Here , we found that honokio l also significantly suppressed metastasis (cell migr ation, invasion and colony form ation) of 786-0 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Honokiol regulated express ion of many genes related to human tumor metastasis in 786-0 cells based on DNA microarray analysis. Real time PCR analysis confirmed th at metastasis suppressor gene KISS1 and its receptor gene, KISS1R , were upregulated by honokiol. In addition, expression of KISS1 and KISS1R in 786-0 cells. Interestingly, the shape chang es and excessive formation of actin stress fibers were identified in cells treated with honokiol. This phe nomenon disappeared when t reated cells pharmacological Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and honokiol. This inhibition can also be identified in 786-0 cells treated with Y-27632 only.

Repair of those Pt-DNA adducts via nucleotide excision repair (NER) or homologous recombination repair (HRR) can substantially reduce the effectiveness of the Pt therapy, contributing to cellular resistance. Hence, inhibition of these repair pathways holds the potential to sensitize resistant cancer cells to Pt treatment. Unlike most therapies, which are focused on enzyme-substrate interactions, ou r approach addre sses protein-D NA disruption, and it is based on the hypothesis that targeting the NER pathway in HRR deficient canc ers in combination with cisplatin therapy will provide increased efficacy w ith minimal toxicity. Replicat ion protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA binding protein that plays a fundamental role in the NER pathwa y, is the subject of the research herein presented. After having identifie d a small molecule inhibitor ( SMI) of RPA with promising in vitro a n d cellular activity, we synthesized analogs of the lead compound and evaluated their ability to be used in combination therapy. S tructure-activity relationship (SAR) stud ies led us to the selectio n of an optimized lead, which showed single agent activ ity in A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells and in a xenograft lung cancer mouse model.

Brutkiewicz1 1 Microbiology And Immunology, Medicine, Indiana, Indianapolis, IN 2 Pathology, Medicine, Indiana, Indianapolis, IN 3 Neurological Surgery, Medicine, Indiana, Indianapolis, IN Email: rmgallo@iupui.edu Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are a special subset of T cells th at recognize lipid antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like, NKT cells rap idly secrete cytokines. Thus, CD1d-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells serves as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses; therefore, it is an important component of the immune system. Several reports suggest that on e of the mechanisms for immune evasion by tumors is deregulation of the C D1d-NKT cell axis. Malignant gli omas are a prevalent form of brain cancer that often has a poor prognosis. To better understand immune ev asion in malignant gliomas, we studied CD1d-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells by these tumors . includ e NKT cells. The tumors had CD1d expression, but it was lower than that seen in normal brain tis sue. Next, human glioblastoma cell lines as well as tumor cells from patients with malignant glioma were analyze d for CD1d expression and function. Almost all cells analyzed were able to stimulate cytokine production f rom human NKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner. However, several of these cell lines required the addit ion of exogenous lipid antigen. This may be due to the low surface expression of CD1d in many of these cell s. An alternative explanation is the presence of endogenous lipids that bind CD1d but fail to activate NKT ce lls. It has been previously shown that tumor cells can shed lipids as a mechan ism to inhibit recognition by NKT cells. We used both pharmacological and shRNA-mediated inhibition of lip id synthesis. We found that inh ibition of the biosynthesis of these lipids resulted in increased activation of NKT cells. Our results sugg est that malignant gliomas decrease CD1d- mediated antigen presentation as a method of evading immune rec ognition. Therefore, restoring the CD1d- NKT cell axis may be an approach that can be utilized to develo p novel therapeutic strategies for treating these tumors.

Autopha gy pathways appear to be tumor suppressive during cancer development but also play a role in tumor survival during cancer progression. Studies have suggested that a selective form of au tophagy, known as c haperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), is up-regulated in many solid tumors and promo tes tumorigenesis. CMA relies on the lysosome-associated membrane pro tein (LAMP)-2A to translocate p roteins from the cytoplasm into lysosomes. Alternative splicing of the LAMP-2 gene human melanoma cell line , DM331, reduced in vitro cell proliferation. Up-regulation of p53, a tumor supp ressor protein, and p21, a cell cycle regulator, were observed in addition to a dec reased in LAMP-2A protein lev els. Furthermore, LAMP-2C overexpression delayed xenograft tumor growth in mice. Thus, LAMP-2C appears t o be a negative regulator of CMA and a tumor growth inhibitor. Studies a re underway to characterize th e role of LAMP-2C as a tumor suppressor. This work was supported by NIH 5T32AI060519, AI079065 and IUCC pilot grant.

Despite tremendous amounts of information about the etiology of breast cancer, man y questions remain unanswered. It has been demonstrated that specific subty pes of breast cancer respond di fferently to chemothera peutic and targeted therapies. The oncogenic events and signaling pathways driving these tumor subtypes a re distinct, indicating that increased knowledge of thei r molecular basis will provide opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches and knowledge of therapeutic res ponsiveness, to ultimately impr ove patient outcomes. The Adenomatous Polyposis (APC) essor is mutated or hypermethyl ated in 18-70% of sporadic breast cancers depending on subtype; however, the effect of APC mutation on tu morigenic properties remains unexplored. APC binds both directly and indirectly to microtubules and regu lates multiple components of the DNA repair pathway, suggesting it may play a critical role in therapeutic responsiveness. Using the ApcMin/+ mouse model, we previously identified pre-neoplastic lesions in the breast, alterations in genes critical in therapeutic resistance, and enhanced breast tumorigenesis in the presence o f the Polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) oncogene independent of Wnt/-catenin signaling. Apc mutation changed the tumor histopathology from solid to squamous adenocarcinomas, resembling the highly aggressive h uman metaplastic breast cancer. Cell lines derived from PyMT-mediated tumor s demonstrated alterations in e xpression of two ATP-binding cassette transporters, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and ATP-bin ding cassette sub-family G member 2/Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2/BCRP), both of which are criti cal in predicting responsiveness to therapeutic agents. In addition, cells from MMTV-PyMT; ApcMin/+ mice are more sensitive to paclitaxel compared to their wild-type counterparts. To translate our find ings to a human breast cancer cell line, we utilized DU4475 cells, which harbor an APC mutation in the -catenin binding region. We have generated stable DU4475 cell lines expressing the middle region or C-term inal domain of APC, and showed that these cell lines have increased sensitiv ity to paclitaxel, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. A third model system, the MDA- MB-157 human metaplastic breast cancer cells, have wild-type AP C. Knockdown of APC in the MDA-MB- 157 cells results in alterations o f the apoptotic response to c isplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Combined, these data suggest that APC modulates therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells in a cell- and drug- dependent manner. Future studies will involve the continued stu dies in the DU4475 and MDA-MB-157 cohorts of cells, and using targeted therapies (based on our mo lecular characterization studies) in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents.

By using a Notch/R BPJ loss-of-function mo del we demonstrated that RBPJ functions as a transcri ptional repressor of the micro RNA miR-155 , a microRNA involved in inflammation and frequently up-regulated in leukemia cells and solid tumors. Loss of Notch signaling in the bone marrow (BM) niche altered hematopoietic homeostasis and le d to a lethal myeloproliferative disease. Loss of Notch/RBPJ-signaling upregulated miR-155 in and B-Ras1, cytokines, in particular G-CSF a nd TNFa. Importantly, deletion of miR-155 i n t h e s t r o m a o f R B P J-/- mice prevented development of myeloproliferative disease and i nduction of pro- inflammatory cytokines. Analysis o f p a t i e n t ' s s a m p l e s a f f e c t e d by myeloproliferative neoplasia showed elevated levels of miR155 in the BM.

Complex posttrans lational modifications of the p 65 subunit (RelA) are a major aspect of the extremely flexible regulation of NF-B activity. Although phosp horylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, well described, arginine methylation has not yet been found. We now report that, in response to interleukin 1(IL-1) , the p65 subu nit of p65 substantially decreased the abilit y of NF-B to bind to B elem ents and to drive gene expression. PRMT5 was the only arginine methyltransfer ase that co-precipitated with p 65, and its overexpression increased NF-B activity, whereas PRMT5 knockdown had the opposite effect. Micr oarray analysis revealed that ~ 85% of the NF-B-inducible genes that are down regulated by the R30A mutat ion are similarly down regulated by knocking PRMT5 down. Many cytoki ne and chemokine genes are amon g these, and conditioned media from cells expressing the R30A mutant of p65 had much less NF-B-ind ucing activity than media from cells expressing the wild-type protein. Furthermore, overexpression o f PRMT5 promoted colon cancer HT29 cell growth and soft agar colony formation, whereas knockdown of PRM T5 led to the opposite effect. PRMT5 is overexpressed in many types of cancer, often to a striking degr ee, indicating that high levels of this enzyme may promote tumorige nesis, at least in part by facilitating NF- B-induced gene expression.

Hypoxia is an important micro-environmental fact or that promotes tumorigenesis. However, the effect of hypoxia on the two most important Hippo-YAP effec tors YAP and TAZ have not been reported. In this work, we demonstrate t hat TAZ was functionally involved in cell proliferation in EOC cells. Hypoxic conditions (1% O2 or hypoxia mimics) of S69 phosphorylated and total TAZ in EOC and other cancer type cells, including breast, prostate and colon cancers. In contrast, these conditions induced a modest reduction of YAP phosphorylation and total YAP expression. These data suggest that hypoxic conditions differentially regulated these two closely r elated Hippo pathway effectors. Up-regulation of TAZ was canonical Y AP/TAZ kinase LATS was under the same cond itions. In addition, blockage of Akt, anothe r potential YAP-TAZ kinase did not have any effect on DMOG-induced TAZ up-regulation. Together, our data re vealed new regulating mechanisms of TAZ and YAP in cancer cells and suggest that although hypoxia i s tumor-promoting in general, it may play negative regulatory roles under certain conditions. This is imp ortant since it indicate s cautions need to be taken when therapeutic targeting hypoxia.

Epithelial ovarian c ancer (EOC) ranks 5th overall for cancer- related death among women. A woma n's lifetime risk of developin g invasive ovarian cancer is 1 in 72. Currently, 61% of woman newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer alr eady have distant metastasis, and five year s u r v i v a l r a t e s a r e o n l y 2 7 % . T hese statistics highlight urgent needs for both developing early detection strategies and thorough understanding of molecular events that promote metastasis. EOC metastasis occurs through a unique anchorage-indepe ndent mechanism, which involve s shedding of both single cells and multi- cellular aggregates (MCAs) into the peritoneal cavity followed by intra-peritoneal implantation, and is often associated with peritoneal ascites. Recent data showed that ser ially selected MCAs exhibit a 104 increase in tumorigenicity relative to the s ame number of parental single c ells. The factors that regulate the terminal transition from free-floating MCA to peritoneally anchored meta static lesion are currently unknown. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent proteases which ar e capable of degrading extracellular matrix proteins. Membrane type 1 MMP (MT 1-MMP, MMP-14) is a transmembr ane collagenase abundantly expressed in ovarian tumors and correlates with poor survival. Our recent studies demonstrated that acquisition of MT1-MMP expression promotes cellular detachment and MCAs formation. To further assess the effect of MT1-MMP expression on MCAs dynamics in EOC, we ge nerated constructs expressing wild- type MT1-MMP, two functions as , and the cat alytically inactive E240A active site mutant. In this study, we evaluated MCAs morphology and dynamics using the cell lines above as well as DOV13 cells that endogenously express high levels of MT1-MMP. MCAs pr oduced using the hanging drop method were evaluated using light and scanning electron microscopy to assess aggregates area and overall morphology. The kinetics of MCAs dispersal on collagen surfaces was also compared between wild type and mutant cell lines. Ou r results suggest a role for MT1-MMP in re gulation of EOC MCAs dynamics. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPage 6 WITH LYSOSOMAL LIPASE Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: zhaot@iupui.edu Inflammation plays crucial roles at all stages of tumor develop ment, from tumor initiation to metastatic progression, during which myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDS Cs) are an important participant. Although MDSCs are known to suppress immune surveillance, their roles in directly stimulating cancer cell proliferation and metastasis curre ntly remains unclear. Lysosom al acid lipase (LAL) deficiency causes systemic expansion and infiltrat ion of MDSCs in multiple organs and subsequent inflammation. In the LAL- deficient ( lal-/-) mouse model, we found that melanoma metastasized massively in allogeneic lal-/-mice, which was suppressed in allogeneic lal+/+mice due to immune rejection. Therefore, we hypothesized that M DSCs with LAL deficiency directly stimulate cancer cell proliferatio n and metastasis. Bone marrow-derived MDSCs from lal-/- mice directly stimulated B16 melanoma cell proliferation in vitro by co-culture analysis and in vivo by co-implantation in the Matri gel plugs. These tumor cell-stim ulatory effects were diminished when myeloid-specific human LAL (hLAL) was expressed in myeloid cell s in lal-/- mice. addition, lal-/- MDSCs facilitated B16 melanoma stasis in the lungs of recipi ent lal+/+ mice via tail vein injection. Furthermore, the mammalian target o f r a p a m y c i n ( m T O R ) a n d i t s d ownstream gene products were significantly up-regulated in mTOR, Raptor or Rictor in lal-/- M D S C s suppressed their stimulation on B16 melanoma cell proliferation , growth and metastasis, indicating the tumor- promoting function of lal-/- MDSCs is mediated, at least in part, through over-activation o f the mTOR pathway. Finally, lal-/- MDSCs stimulated proliferation and growth of Lewis lung carcin oma (LLC), and transgenic mouse prostate cancer (TRAMP-C2) cells, and these ef fects were impaired af ter mTOR inhibition. Our results indicate that LAL plays a critical role in regulati ng MDSCs ability to directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation, and overcome immune rejection of cancer metastas is in allogeneic mice through modulation of the mTOR pathway, which provides a mechanistic basis for target ing MDSCs to reduce the risk of cancer metastasis. Therefore, MDSCs possess dual functions to facilita te cancer metastasis: suppress immune surveillance, and stimul ate cancer cell proliferation and growt h.

Recent evidence suggests that PRMT5 may function as an oncoge ne and its overexpression contri butes to the development and progression of several human cancers. Howeve r, the mechanism underlying the regulation of PRMT5 expression in cancer cells remains largely unknown. In the present study, we have ma pped the core promoter of PRMT5 to the -240 bp region and identified nuclear transcription factor (NF- Y) as a critical transcription factor to regulate PRMT5 expression in multiple can cer cell lines. Further, we pre sent evidence that PRMT5 is responsible for cell growth inhibition induced by knockdown of NF-YA, a DNA bin ding domain-containing subunit that forms a heterotrimeric complex w ith NF-YB and NF-YC. Significan tly, we have found that activation protein C (PKC) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) cancer induces expression and down-regulates the expression of NF-YA and PRMT5 at transcription level. Given that down-regulation of several PKC isozymes is implicated in the de velopment and progression of several human cancers, our findings suggest that the PKC-c-Fos-NF-Y signaling pathway may be responsible for PRMT5 overexpression in a subset of human cancer patients.

MELK has been associated with diverse processes that include ce ll proliferation, spliceosome assembly, hematopoiesis, stem cell self-re newal, and apoptosis. The level s of MELK are strongly associated with poor prognosis in breast and brain cancer patients. Structure-based computational screening of a compound library led to the discovery of MELK sma ll-molecule inhibitor KIN1. The compound was shown to inhibit MELK enzyme activity with an IC50 of 1 \u00b5M in recombinant protein and in cell culture. Kinome-wide profiling confirmed that MELK is among the top targets of KIN1 and the on ly serine/threonine kinase. The compound was found to inhibit MDA-MB-231 TNBC and U87 GBM cancer cell pr oliferation in anchorage-dependent and independent assays. Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis revealed that the compound caused cell cycle arrest. This is consistent with compound up-regulation of p21, and down-regulation of survivin.

This phase I/II trial evaluates tolerabili ty and efficacy of B combined (EPs) are to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD, phase I) and respons e rate (RR, phase II) to D+B. Secondary EPs were PFS, toxicities and rate o f clinical benefit. Translat ional EPs were treatment effects on circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CHSPCs), containing measurable OC, primary peritoneal (PP), fallopian tube and uterine (phase I on ly) cancer, up to 3 prio rregimens, ECOG PS of 0-1 and normal end-organ functi on. B was given orally BID and D was given IV at 40mg/m2 every 28 days. 3+3 dose escalation was used, starting with B at 150mg BID. Results: Eleven pts were enrolled in phase I. Median age was 59 (range 26-82); 8 pts had OC, 2 uterine and 1 PP Dose lev el+1 (B at 150mg BID) was not tolerated due to grade 3 fatigue, and grade 2 diarrhea, causing treatment interruption (DLT). Among 6 pts at dose level-1 (B at 100mg BID), 1 pt with history of chemotherapy ind uced myelosupression had grade 4 neutropenia (DLT). Other (36.4%), vomiting (27.3%), headache (27.3%), allergic reaction and oral pain (9.1%). Three p ts had PRs, 3 SD and 4 disease progression; 1 was not evaluable. A decrease in the pCHSPC/nCHSPC ratio was ob served after 1 cycle (1.58, n=8) compared to baseline (1.68, n=10, p=0.4). At treatment discontinuation, the pCHSPC/nCHSPC ratio was 1.97 (n=4). Analyses are ongoing. Conclusions: In summary, D+B is t olerated at 40mg/m2 and 100mg BID. An expanded cohort using generic liposomal doxorubicin and B at level -1 is planned before initiation of the phase II cohort.

The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway requ ires over 30 proteins to catalyze the removal of bulky DNA damage including UV-photoproducts and intrastrand DNA lesions induced by platinum-based cancer chemotherapeutics. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway can repair a simple DNA double strand break with as few as four proteins. Many of these interactions have been identified and characterized using immuno-precipitation, yeast two-hybrid assa ys, a number of these interactio ns, we have employed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) which provides excelle nt resolution and quantificat ion of specific protein-protein associations in individual cells. The XPA-RPA interaction has been extensively characterized and occurs independent of exogenous DNA damage. PLA analysis confirmed this interaction u sing multiple antibodies to detect the interaction and in numerous human cancer cell lines. Interestin gly, the analysis of a number of other NER proteins interactions was detec ted independent of exogenous DNA damage including XPG with both RPA and XPA and ERCC1-XPA. These data suggest that sub-complexes of NER proteins exist in cells independent of exogenous DNA damage and that assembly of an active NER complex involves pre-formed sub-complexes. We selected the Ku70-DNA-PKcs in teractions to monitor the NHEJ pathway interactions. Again, a robust signal was detected independent of exogenously induced DNA DSBs . While the interaction of Ku70 with DNA-PKcs is thought to require a free DNA terminus, we cannot r ule out the possibility t hat the interactions detected are occurring at telomeres, where both proteins have b een shown to be localized. Surprisingly, we can also detect interactions with Ku and some of the NER protei ns suggesting the possib ility of inter-pathway interactions. Overall these re sults suggest that sub-complexes of DNA repair proteins exist within cells independent of DNA damage and may serve as a reservoir of compl exes to be deployed to the sites of damage.

However, recent work showed that amplif ication of the MYCN oncogene can also spur the development of retinoblastoma in a f raction of unilateral patients with normal RB1 alleles. Our aim was to identif y small molecules from a library of known bioactive compounds that show selective growth inhibition of a MYCN A RB1 +/+ retinoblastoma cell line A RB1 -/- cell line (Y79) . Such molecules may be leads for therapy of MYCN A RB1 +/+ retinoblastoma, and will further elucidate the molecular differen ces between these two subtypes of retinoblastoma. Compounds from the LOPAC1280 library were tested to judge their effect at 10 m M o n cell proliferation in both Y79 and RB3823 cell lines using Alamar Blue after a 48 hour incubation in 384 well format. Compounds that reduced cell proliferation by at least 40% in one or both cell lines were te sted twice more in both cell lines to confirm efficacy. Dose response testing was conducted using compound co ncentrations ranging from 100 pM to 1 mM in 384 well format. In initial screening, 95 compounds showed c ytotoxicity to one or both cell lines. Secondary screening yielded 9 compounds that reduced RB3823 pro liferation by at least 40% compared to untreated cells. Confirmatory s creening identified 6 of those 9 compounds that reduced RB3823 proliferation by at least twice that of Y79. In dose-response assays of 5 of these compounds, one compound showed reproducibly higher efficacy in RB3823 than Y79. Dimethoxy-naph thoquinone (DMNQ) had a GI 50 i n RB3823 at least 3 times lower tha n that for Y79. DMNQ is an oxi dizing quinone that is thought to work by depleting cellular reduction potential leading to oxidation of proteins and DNA, causing cell death. Given our findings, potential may exist for selective treatment options f or aggressive, MYCN -driven retinoblastoma. DMNQ has not been used in humans, but a DMNQ derivative has sho wn efficacy in a mouse lung carcinoma xenograft. Further characterization of DMNQ's mode of action in the retinoblastoma context is required, but the door is open to the family o f quinones as po tential treatme nt options for MYCN A RB1 +/+ retinoblastoma.

Fairbanks School Of Public Health At IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN Email: sbigatti@iu.edu Over half a million Americans died from some form of cancer in 2008. Actively working through the associated emotions is associated with less distress at the end of life for the cancer patient and partner. There have been only a handful of empirically tested programs focused on the death-related concerns of dying patients, none of which include a partner. Throughout the cance r progression, and especially at the end of life, relationship issues are of foremo st concern for the patient, an d the distress of the patient at the time of death affects the partner much as it does at other points of the canc er journey. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and sa tisfaction with an intervention to decrease death-related distress in patients and their partners. We also did a preliminary evaluation of efficac y and examined potential mediator variables. Advanced cancer patients and their spouses (n = 12 couples) wer e recruited through the IUSCC cancer center into a 4 week intervention. The intervention drew from extensiv e, cross-disciplinary and cross-theoretical research in palliative care and end of life. The result was a m eaning-centered supportive intervention that included activities an d topics that have demonstrated efficacy across a large population of patients, providers and settings.We saw positive cha nges in most variables examined , although most were statistically non- significant given our sample size. We were able to recruit 41% of participants referred to the study. All but one couple completed all assessments; one patient passed away m id-intervention, so that couple's participation ended before completion. All participants reported high levels of satisfaction overall with the intervention, with all agreeing that they wou ld recommend the intervention to others facing advanced disease. Our qualitative interviews at the c onclusion of the intervention pr ovided rich suggestions f or modifications. The pilot study will provide the foundation for a grant proposal to test the intervention in a large-scale study.

Fairbanks School Of Public Health At IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN Email: coek@iu.edu In both developed and developing countries, breast cancer is no w one of the most commonly diagnosed reproductive cancers and a primar y cause of death among women. Women treated for breast cancer are likely to receive either radiation or chemotherapy, both of which have secondary effects. Chemotherapeutic treatment produces a range of re latively immediate effects, inc luding pain, nausea, fatigue, mouth sores, depression, problems sleeping, and temporary hair loss. Of thes e, women across cultures often report that hair loss is one of the more troubleso me; it makes them feel unattra ctive and look like they are sick or dying. Further, they often feel stigmatized by others. Hair, in cultur es located around the world, is regarded as important. As we see a response to hair loss across cultures, a nd the emotional and social responses are so immediate and intense, the evolu tionary history of our species may offer us some clues as to why the loss of hair is so often and so widely reported as being traumatic. One of the identifying characteristics of mammals i s t h e p r e s e n c e o f h a i r - - a l l m a mmals, and only mammals have h air. One of the first physical traits that distinguished the evolutionary path to modern humans, besides b ipedal posture, may have been the loss of much of the body hair, an evolutionary event that may have occu rred over a million years ago. For humans, temporary or permanent hair loss, or the excessive shedding of normal human hairs was probably a fairly rare event in our ancestral past. Temporary loss could have been bro ught about by a variety of stressors including illness and exposure to certain o f the parasitic pests with who m we co-evolved. Hair has been seen across cultures as a biological indicator of general health. Symons (1 979) observed that because \"luxuriant hair\" (e.g., thick, shiny, manage able = the so-called \"healthy hair\") may be universally attractive during our evolutionary history, it has been \"reliably associated with hea lth and vigor\" and a woman's ability to influence others (p. 187). Hair also is an indicator of illness; among ma ny groups, including the Tonga [Polynesia], Hopi [southwestern United States] and Azande [North Central Afr ica], the condition of one's hair was used to diagnose illness and communicated that that person should be av oided. In this poster, we look at the cross- cultural patterns of responses to hair loss and examine its pos sible evolutionary roots. We argue that there is a deep biological basis for these emotions and that, consequently , it is important to develop specific and culturally-tailored interventions to provide support for these women.

Research is needed to understand the complex interplay between individual, social, and health care s ystems and their influence on colonoscopy completion. The purpose of this study was to compare people who completed a scheduled colonoscopy after receiving a referral with those who did not on demographic and clinical characteristic s, CRC knowledge, and health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived b arriers). Quantitative data were collected via telephone interv iews from 90 patients; 46 who completed colonos copy and 44 non-completers. In-depth interviews were conduc ted with 42 participan ts to examine perce ptions of barriers and facilitators to test completion. Data were analyzed us ing two-sample t-tests, chi-sq uare tests, Fisher's exact tests and content analysis. People who completed colonoscopy had a higher mean CR C knowledge score (p=.0008), and a smaller proportion had hypertension (p=.03). No group differenc es in perceived risk (p=0.81), perceived benefits (p=0.66), and perceived barriers scores (p=0.24) were observed. Non-completers frequently reported that life events interfered with their ability to keep their ap pointments. While receipt of a provider recommendation is the most important predictor of CRC screening , results showed that receipt of a recommendation with immediate referral to an endoscopist and au tomatic colonoscopy appointment-making were not sufficient to insure test completion. Education and ta i l o r e d c o u n s e l i n g a b o u t t h e n e e d f o r a n d benefits of colonoscopy, along with reminders and tangible assi stance to complete the test in the context of competing demands, may be required to increase completion rates .

Researchers have focused on the role of social support in cancer patient distress; howev er, social constraints (SCS; e.g., avoidance, criticism, minimization of patient s' concerns) have received le ss attention, despite work suggesting that they may be more strongly associated with distress than social suppo rt. Guided by social cognitive processing theory, we reviewed the relationship between SCS and distress i n cancer patients in order to inform future psychosocial intervention development. This meta-analysis: (1) quantified the average strength of the relationships between SCS and general distress (e.g., depressiv e and anxiety symptoms) and SCS and cancer- specific distress (e.g., avoidance and intrusions); and (2) exa mined whether age, sex, and time since diagnosis moderated SCS-distress relations hips. A total of 30 studies wer e analyzed, including 26 associations between SCS and general distress and 20 associations between SCS and ca ncer-specific distress. Correlation coefficients were weighted by sample size and transformed using Fisher's Z-transformation prior to computation of mean effect sizes. We also examined the homogene ity of effect sizes using I2 and potential moderators (i.e., age, sex, time since diagnosis). A fail-safe N analysis was conducted for each relationship. Moderate, significant relations hips were found between SCS and general distress (r=.37) and SCS and cancer- specific distress (r=.37). Age an d sex did not moderate either relationship. Time since diagnosis moderated the relationship between SCS and canc er-specific distress (=-.82, p=.0001), but not general distress, such that the relationship between SCS and cancer-specific distress was stron ger for samples with a s horter mean time since diagnosis than those with a longer mean time since diagnosis. F indings suggest that SCS may be an important variable to target in interventio ns to reduce distress in cance r patients. Rebecca Adams is supported by R25 CA117865-06 (V. Champion, PI).

To improve the care of pa tients who may be near the end of life, there is a need to better understand their life and treatment goals, psychological well-being, and h ow they may change as patients get closer to death. Patients (N=31; median days until death = 145) with incu rable advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancers completed a self-report survey, inc luding measures of h ope, optimism, and symptoms of anxiety and depression at Time 1 and approximately 3 months later at Time 2 . At both timepoints patients also participated in a semi-structure d interview where they were ask ed to freely list their current life goals and cancer treatment goals. Then, they were asked to select five pr iority goals from among both lists and to rank them in order of importance. Sub sequently, these goals were cod ed using the following categories: Anti- Cancer, Cure, Life Prolongation, Return to Normal Functioning, Symptom Palliation, Life Fulfillment, Social Connectedness, Altruistic, Preparation for Death, Pragmatic, an d Spiritual. Patients listed marginally fewer life goals at Time 2 compared to Time 1, t(30)=1.708, p=.098. There was no significant difference in the frequency or rank of any goal category in priority goals or par amount goals. The number of patients who listed cure in priority goals decreased significantly, 2 (1) = 8.18, p=.004. Although not significant, there was an increase in the number of An ti-Cancer paramount goals (from 7 to 11). There were no significant changes in hope, optimism, or symptoms o f anxiety and depression as pat ients got closer to the end of life. These results suggest that the valued g oals of patients with advanced cancer may not change drastically as they get closer to the end of life. The decrease in Cure goals and incre ase in Anti-Cancer paramount goals may reflect patients regoaling. Social-Conn ectedness was the prevailing the me for priority goals at both timepoints, suggesting spending time with lov ed ones is a valued goal for p atients with advanced cancer. Therefore, clinically it may be important t o discuss the social implicatio ns of treatment options.

Research has suggested that CRC screening interventions be targeted to African Americans based upon cultural dimensions. This seconda ry analysis used baseline data from a large randomized trial to examine: 1) relationships among cultural factors (i.e., provider trust, can cer fatalism, health temporal orientation), health literacy, and CRC knowledge; 2) a ge and gender differences in c ultural variables, health literacy, and CRC knowledge; and 3) relationships among these variables and inten tion to screen for CRC . African-American primary care who were not up-to-date with CRC screenin g (n=817) completed a telephone interview prior to being randomized to one of two CRC screening intervent ions. Data were examined using Pearson's correlation, t-test, chi-square tests, and multiple regression analyses. Provider trust was positively correlated with health temporal orientation (p<.01). Cancer fatalism was n egatively correlated with health literacy (p<.01) and CRC knowledge (p<. 01), whereas health literacy was positively correlated with CRC knowledge ( p < . 0 1 ) .

Men had lower health literacy scores than women (p<.01), but r eported greater intentions to c omplete a SBT (p<.01) or receive a colonoscopy (p<.05). Health lite racy significantly predicted in tention to receive SBT in multiple regression analyses (p<.05). However, neith er overall model predicted inte ntion to receive either SBT or colonoscopy in multiple regression analyses.

Oncology nurses play a vital role in the symptom self-management needs o f cancer patients. Taxane-induced musculoskeletal pain in women w ith ovarian cancer is an importa nt symptom requiring further self- management attention. The purpose of this review was to develop an integrated conceptual model to guide future research on taxane-induced musculoskeletal pain in women with ovarian cancer. Methods: A review of the literature pertaining to thr ee health behavior theories (i. e. Self-efficacy Theory, t he Common Sense Model, and the Transactional model of Stress and Coping) in oncology s ymptom management research was conducted using the Web of Science database. Potential concepts and relationship statements were identified through the supporting literature and integrated into a new mod el. Results: Primary appraisal, perceived self- efficacy for symptom self-management, symptom self-management, secondary appraisal, and outcomes were concepts from health behavior th eory used in the integrated mod el. To date, no models have assimilated concepts from these three theori es to guide oncology symptom ma nagement research. Discussion: Further research is needed to test the concepts and proposed relationsh ips. Findings from future research may facilitate successful interventio n choices, effective symptom m anagement, and improved quality of life in women with ovarian cancer experie ncing taxane-induced musculosk eletal pain from chemotherapy treatment.

Education increases vaccine acc eptance and YMSM tend to have high knowledge regarding HPV transmission, but poor knowledge regard ing the consequences of infection. Objectives: To examine the association of k nowledge on HPV vaccination and intent to get vaccinated among YMSM. Methods: 1,449 YMSM who were 18-26 years old (M=22.5, SD=2.4) and membe rs of an online social and sexual networking site completed an online survey co vering HPV vaccine history, knowledge, and intention. Intent to get vaccinated was measured on a 3-item sc ale with response choices ranging from 0-10. The mean score across the items w as dichotomized into low (0-5) and high (6-10) intention. Knowledge about HPV transmission/prevention was assessed with 5 true/false item s (e.g., Condoms help protect you from HPV). Knowledge about the consequences to males of HPV infectio n also was assessed with 5 items (e.g., HPV can cause penile cancers). Results: 98 (6.8%) reported receiving at least one dose of vaccine. The mean transmission knowledge score (4.1/5) was significantly higher t han the mean score for knowledge about consequences (2.0/5; p<0.001). T hose who were vaccinated had si gnificantly higher knowledge about both transmission (M=4.5/5) and consequences (M=3.0/5) than those wh o were unvaccinated & M=1.9, p<0.01). Among to the intent- to-vaccinate items, 64.3% were in the high intent group, with 35.7% indicating low intent to get vaccinated. Transmission knowledge did not differ between the two groups. However, those with low intent to get vaccinated had significantly lower knowledge scores regarding HPV consequences (M=1.9/5) than those with a high intent to get vaccinated (M=2.1/5; p<0.01). Implications and Impact: Overall, these YMSM had generally high HPV vaccine acceptability and high kno wledge about HPV transmission . However, knowledge regarding the consequences of HPV infection wa s poor. Moreover, low knowledge of consequences was associated with non-vaccination and lower intent to get vaccinated. Our finding s suggest that educa tional interventions focusing on the consequences of HPV infection for YMSM could he lp increase vaccination rates.

Ellen Lee1, Beth Szuck2, Y.K. James Lau3, Janet Carpenter4 1 Public Health, Indianapolis, IN 2 WRHA Breast Health Centre, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, 3 CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, 4 Nursing, Indianapolis, IN Email: leece@iupui.edu Background : Physical activity (PA) has an important role in breast cancer (BC) survivorship. However, these effects depend largely on breast cancer survivors' (BCS) PA adh erence. The purpose of the study was to determine factors that could predict long-term PA adherence amo ng BCS 6 months after completion of a community-based lifestyle intervention program. Methods : Twenty-five BCS who participated in a 6-week lifestyle intervention program, Healthy Eating and Active Livin g Level 1, were included in this study. Non- modifiable factors, including age , ethnicity, education level, and comorbidity, and baseline stage of readiness to change in PA behavior were assessed. Modifiable factors, inc luding working hours, body mass index, PA adherence, and PA self-efficacy were also assessed at baseline, post-program, and 3 months post-program. Hierarchical linear multiple ste pwise regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors of long- term PA adherence at 6 months. Results : A majority (60%) of the partic ipants were at stages of action or maintenance in their PA behavior at baseline. The analyses iden tified two factors that were significant predictors of long-term PA adherence -- baseline PA adherence ( = 0.36; p = 0.058), and post-program PA adherence ( = 0.50; p = 0.011). Both factors accounted for 64. 4% of the variance in long-term PA adherence. Conclusion : The study findings may have important implications for future designs of community-based lifestyle intervention programs for BCS. PA level before and im mediately after intervention appears to be significant determinants for long-term PA adherence, especially in groups that are mostly active or starting to be more active initially.

Objective : To systematically review the different types of IT that are b eing used to change patient behavior, the effectivenes s and impact each form of IT has on changing patient behavior among the many divergent disease categories, and the contrasting theories /models used with these technologies to predict patient behavior. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were sear ched for studies published between February and September 2013, using ke ywords and medical subject headings (MESH). Potentially relevant studies were retrieved and assesse d for eligibility based on pre-determined inclusion criteria. In addition, references to articles identif ied during the search were also reviewed. Result: A total of 133 articles met the inclusion criteria and were revie wed in detail. Overall, 83% of studies showed a positive impact on patient behavior, 11% showed IT as providing no significant value, and 6% showed that patients intend to use technology to modify their behavior. The information technologies used included: Internet-based interventions (48%), mobile-based interventions (3%), a nd email (2%). Only 48% of the studies used behavioral theories to predict patient behavior. Of those, 78% used cognitive theories, while 22% used behavioral learning theories. Conclusion: Although several studies demons trated that IT has a positive i mpact on patient behavior, other studies showed no impact. Therefore, further exploration of mor e comprehensive inte rventions integrating several technologies to change patient behavior may be warrante d. These types of IT int ervention need to be based on sound theory and the tenets of engaging patients and i ncorporating socio-technical design into their development and implementation. I n addition, assessing these ty pes of interventions should be conducted using a myriad of measurements, including motivation for behavi or change, longstanding adherence, expenditure, satisfaction, and health outcomes.

At diagnosis, patients ge nerally have low survival rate s and short life expectancies. Providing comprehensive and timely end of life (EOL) care is imperative y et challenging for this population. Whereas the majority of studies regardin g pancreatic cancer focus on ag gressive treatment, there is a pressing need to maximize the pancreatic cancer patients' comfort level at EOL. Purpose: The purpose of this integrated review was to explore the advanced pancreatic cancer patients' EOL experiences to provide a foundation for future research, education, and practice. Methods: An integrative literature review was conducted to examine studies published between 1980 and 2013 using key words of EOL, palliative or hospice care, and pancreatic cancer. Studies were obtained fro m the Pubmed, Medline, and CIN AHL databases based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Twelve articles were found that m et inclusion criteria. More t han half were case studies (58.3%) and the remaining manuscripts were quantitative descriptive studies (2 5%), literature review (8.3%) and phenomenology study (8.3%). All but one study failed to identify an overarching theory and few studies described the EOL needs from patients' or families' per spectives. The top three foci identified from the studies reviewed were patients' physical symptoms and signs (75 %), psychosocial aspects (41.7%), and communication and decision making issues (33.3%). Few studies d iscussed patients' spiritual needs and overall quality of EOL. Studies which focused on physical sympt oms identified that fatigue and nutrition related symptoms were the most d istressing symptoms and were no ted to increase in intensity in the last 8 weeks before death. Severe and poorly controlled pain was also widely reported. With regard to psychosocial aspects, several issues such as worry, financial problems, loss of role function, compromised autonomy, managing other?s expectations and relationship with health care providers and family were listed in the studies. For decision making issu es, one importa nt example was that patients and families often struggled with deciding the end point of receiving aggressive care. Discussion: This review reveals the challenges of providing EOL care for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. The main issues identified in this review can be categorized in issues related to physical symptoms, psychologic al aspects and communication and decision making. Research is needed that addresses needs and concerns fr om the patient and family prospective and focuses on difficulties of decidi ng end points of treatment and initiation of palliative or EOL care. In addition, more exploratory work is needed to identify the gap between pat ient needs and practice. While symptom management is important in EOL, clinicians should also be aware of other elements such as psychosocial and spiritual needs and the interaction among them.

Participants: Female undergraduates (N=286) at a Midwestern university completed a survey between September and December of 2012. Methods: Pearson's correlations and chi-square analy ses were used to examine relat ionships between health behaviors and HPV vaccine receipt and intentions. Results: HPV vaccine receipt was associated with having a regular healt hcare provider and having one or more hepatitis B vaccine shots, a fl u shot in the past year, a P ap smear, and a dental visit in the past year. Among unvaccinated students (n=1 21), increased HPV vaccine intentions were associated with receiving a flu shot in the past year and HIV t esting. HPV vaccine receipt and intentions were not related to exercise, fruit/ve getable intake, smoking, or al cohol intake. Conclusions: Findings suggest that promoting HPV vaccination in conjunction with other preventive medical services might improve vaccine uptake.

In this breast cancer prevention study, we examined whether: 1) me ssages matched to an individual's preferred coping style would increase phys ical activity; 2) messages matc hed to an individual's preferred coping style would increase information seeking about breast cancer; 3) whet her increased exercise was associated with decreased breast cancer worry and perceived breast cancer risk. Method: Five breast cancer prevention flyers were designed to match either monitoring or blunting preferred coping styles. The flyers provided information about the positive effect of curre nt physical activity on futur e breast cancer risk and attempted to persuade readers to increase exercise. College-aged females ( N = 450) viewed the flyers and completed psychosocial (cancer worry, perceived breast cancer risk, perceived behavior al control), cognitive (monitoring/blunting), exercise, and information-seekin g measures at baseline and four weeks later. The females were categorized as either monitors or blunters, and coded as viewing a matched (1) or an unmatched (0) message. Results: Regarding our first question, m ultinomial logistic regression w as conducted to examine the relationship between matched mess ages and increased physical activity. Resul ts were non-significant. Regarding our second question, binary logistic regression was conducted to pr edict if psychosocial variables and matched messages led to more information- seeking about breast cancer. A test of the full model was statistically significant ( X2 ( 5 , N = 4 3 9 ) = 2 1 , p = .001). Both cancer worry measures'severity and frequency'wer e significant predictors with the odds of seeking more breast can cer information increasing as both severity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.46) and frequency (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.58) increased, as well. Regarding our third question, one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine if increased exercise was related to differences in cance r worry and perceived breast can cer risk. There was no significant difference in cancer worry, but there was a significant difference in perceiv ed breast cancer risk. Individuals who increased their exercise had a significant reduction in their perceived b reast cancer risk after four weeks F (1, 411) = 4.13, p = . 0 4 . Conclusion: Messages matched to an individual's preferred coping style nei ther increased physical activity nor information seeking in our study; however , cancer worry emerged as a significant predictor of information seeking about cancer. This finding sup ports the literature on the potential motivational qualities of cancer worry. Moreover, increased exe rcise was associated with decreased perceived breast cancer risk. Whether decreased perceived breast cancer r isk leads to an increase or decrease in cancer prevention and early detection behaviors warrants further inves tigation. Behavioral Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPage 8 #86 COMMU NICATION: THE SUPPORT IVE BENEFITS OF LEGA CY BUILDING FOR FAMILIES OF ADVANCED CA NCER PATIENTS Jennifer Bernat1, Paul Helft2, Laura Wilhelm3, Karen Schmidt2, Shelley Johns2 1 Nursing, Indianapolis, IN 2 Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Medicine, Charleston, WV Email: jbernat@iupui.edu Background: Being diagnosed with advanced cancer is a painful reality that impacts patients and their family members. Patients with advanced cancer nearing death face great physical, psychological, social, and spiritual distress. Family members face the challenge of living their liv es devoid of their loved one and are left with feelings of loss and sometimes r egret from conversations left u nspoken. Dignity therapy is an evidence-based intervention that encourages te rminally ill patients to reflect upon and communicate their memories, values, and wisdom through the creation of a legacy project. This proje ct succeeds the person in death and is handed down to surviving loved ones, ensuring continuity to the family members who are left behind. Our study qualitatively explores the family members' reactions to the leg acy building process and the communication shared in the legacy project to learn about its potential for f uture bereavement support. Method: Brief (20-30 minute) semi-structured phone interviews with family members (n =7) of terminally ill cancer patients were completed approximately one week after receiving the patient's legacy project. Recipients were spouses (n=4), siblings (n=2), or an adult child (n=1). Interviews were coded using conventional content analysis using an open-coding strategy. Themes were recorded as they emerged. Results: The following communication themes emerged from the data. Legacy building: (1) facilitates convers a t i o n ; ( 2 ) c r e a t e s n e w k n o w l e d g e a n d understanding; and (3) leaves las ting communication for future generations. The family members felt that overall communication improved, and they were able to discuss t he terminal nature of th eir loved one's illness. New knowledge was communicated in the legacy project and someti mes this new knowledge led to further understanding of the patient's p ersonal life events. Furthermor e, the project was viewed as a family heirloom that would be passed down to fut ure generations, creating lasti ng communication. All fa mily members stated they would recommend the project to others. Conclusions: This study adds to the literature on the supportive benefit legacy building has on fa milies of advanced cancer pati ents by examining the unique impact of communication. Participants in our study reported deriving mean ingful benefit from reading the legacy project, and future research should investigate and quantitativ ely assess bereavement outcomes over time, as well as the direct impact these outcomes have on family members ' quality of life.

Lung c ancer is thought asy mptomatic until advan ced; however, many at an early stage experience symptoms but do not seek medical evaluation. Underst anding potential barriers to medical help- seeking behavior in lung cancer symptoms is critical; lung canc er stigma is an important barrier. Purpose: The purpose was to 1) determine if there was a correlation betw een perceived lung cancer stigma and delayed medical help-seeking behavior in lung cancer patients, and 2) d escribe sociodemographic characteristics related to perceived lung cancer stigma. It was hypothesized 1) there would be a positive relationship between lung cancer stigma scores and delayed medical help-seeking beha vior, and 2) lung canc er stigma scores would differ by ethnicity, gender, and smoking status. Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational design (N = 93 patients; diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer - all stages) using survey methodology to measure perceived lung cancer stigma and a n in-person interview to coll ect demographic and medical characteristic data. Results: Pearson correlation revealed a significant relationship betwee n lung cancer stigma scores and delayed medical help-seeking behavior ( r = .27, p = .01). Independent-samples t-tests revealed no significant difference in lung cancer stigma scores by gender, but a statis tically significant difference by ethnicity (t (91) = -2.57, p = .012, two-tailed). One-way ANOV A explored the impact of smoki ng status on lung cancer stigma scores and found no significant difference among never, past, o r current smokers\"(F (2,90) = .14, p = .872). Conclusions: Lung cancer stigma is a potential barrier to timely medical he lp-seeking behavior, subsequent diagnosis and treatment in indi viduals with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer. There may be a cultural component to perceived lung cancer stigma; however, further inv estigation is needed. Findings indicate a public health need for increasing awareness of the prevalence o f perceived lung cancer stigma regardless of smoking status. Future research should target decreasing the st igma associated with lung cancer and increasing early medical help-seeking behavior. Learning Object ives: (1) Report the rel ationship between lung cancer stigma and delayed help-seeking behavior. (2) Describe s ociodemographic characteristics associated with lung cancer stigma. (3) Discuss the public health need of addressing lung cancer stigma in interventions to promote early help-seeking be havior in individuals with symp toms suggestive of lung cancer.

In a U.S. national sample of parents of 11-17- year-old males (N=779), 78.6% of parents reported their sons ha d not received the HPV vaccine. We explored vaccine acceptability (i.e., w illingness to vaccinate) and reas ons for non-vaccination among these parents. The most commonly endorsed reason for non-vaccination (61.6%) was M y doctor or health-care provider has not recommended it. Non-vaccination due to non-recommendation or ot her logistical barriers was associated with significantly higher vaccine a cceptability than non-vaccination due to attitudinal barriers, such as concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy. In sum, many parents are acce pting of the vaccine but have not vaccinated their sons due to lack of access, education, or recommendation from healthcare provider s. These findings have important implications for incr easing HPV vaccination coverage among adolescent males.

For children and their parents, the cancer experience can be transformative and lead t o reappraisals in goals. However, the factors that facilitate growth and the m echanisms by which this process occurs are unknown. Hope is the belief that goals can be met, and it consists of two parts: 1) Agency (one' s perception that he or she can progress and/or persevere toward goals), and 2) Pathways (the perceived ability to find methods of reaching goals). Dispositional hope is believed to influence people's reactions to life events (e.g., diagnosis of chronic illness) with potential to promote either e ngagement or disengagement wi th identified goals. Posttraumatic growth (PTG) is a positive change in major life goals experienced as a result of the struggle with a highly challenging life circumstance. Both hope and PTG are goal-related construct s which can be conceptualized in self- regulation theory. However, few studies have examined how dispo sitional hope is related to PTG as an outcome. In particular, no studies have examined the relationsh ip between hope and PTG in parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer. Objective: To examine the relationshi p between dispositional hope and PTG among parents of children and adolescents receiving tre atment for pediatric cancer. Dispositional hope was hypothesized to be positively related to PTG in this p opulation. Methods: Participants were parents (N=85, 82% female) of children (55% female; 2-18 years) with ca ncer. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire, the Posttraumati c G r o w t h I n v e n t o r y ( P T G I ) , a n d H o p e S c a l e ( H S ) . Results: Hierarchical regressions were conducted. Following the transactional stress and coping model, demographic and illness covariates were entered on Step 1 of the regressions, and the H S total score was entered on Step 2. Hope was related to PTG in parents (p=.0 03), with higher levels of hope associated with greater PTG. There was a trend for the overall model to be significant (p=.057), and it predic ted 15% of the variab ility in PTG. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the subscales of the PTGI. For Relat ing to Others, hope was related to growth (p=.002); the model predicted 17 .2% of the variability in relat ing to others (p=.028). For New Possibilities, hope was related to growth (p=.008); the model predicted 15.6% of the variability in new possibilities (p=.048). For Personal Strength, hope was related to growth (p= .030); however, the model was nonsignificant. The model for Spiritual Change was also nonsignificant. For App reciation of Life, hope was related to growth (p=.005); the model predicted 17. 1% of the variability in life appreciation (p=.029). Conclusions: Findings suggest that dispositional hope ma y facilitate growth in parent s o f c h i l d r e n w i t h c a n c e r . H o p e m a y b e a n important target for promoting positive goal adjustment in this population. Behavioral Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPage 90 of 12 4 37 H PV TYPES OF HPV REDETECTION Marcia Shew1 1 Pediatrics, IU School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: mshew@iu.edu Objective: To examine factors associated with the redetection of anogenit a l H P V t y p e s . Methods: A longitudinal cohort (N=150) of adolescent women, ages 15 to 17 years at enrollment, with behavioral and sexually transmitted infection ( STI) information assessed every 3 months, was used to examine HPV redetection. Cox proportional ha zard models were used to assess the influence of sexual behaviors and STIs in the preceding 3 months on the redetection of low risk (LR) and high risk (HR) HPV. Results: There were 1248 type specific infections (defined as 2 or more samples pos itive for the same type) within the cohort; 766 HR and 482 LR-HPV infections. Redetection after a period of non -detection (defined as greater 2 consecutive negative HPV test, approximately 6 months or greater) occurred for 23.9% of HR-HPV (183/766) and 19.3% of LR-HPV (93/242) of average d 14.5 months (SD=11.8). Univariate models found chlamydia, more sexua l partners, coital frequency, less condom use and use of oral contraceptive pills (ocp) associa ted with frequency of (HR=1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01]) were use (HR=2.73 [95%CI, increased ris k of LR-HPV redetection. The multivariate model for combined HR and LR HPVs found that all 4 variables we re significantly associated with redetection. Discussion: This study demonstrates a role for chl amydia and sexual behaviors in type-specific HPV redetection.Redetection may represent either reactivation o r new infection. However, redection may also be associated with viral persist ance and subsequent progression to cancer. Population Science/Epidemiology FacultyPage 91 of 12 4 cint/crd/admin/abstract_book.ph pPOSTER #91 METABOLIC SYNDROME AND TOTAL CANC ER MORTALITY RESULTS FROM THE THIRD NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITI ON EXAMINATION SURVEY (NHANES III) Wambui Mwangi1, Patrick Monahan2,3, Mwangi Murage1, Jianjun Zhang1,3 1 Department Of Epidemiology, Richard M. Fairbank s School Of Public Health, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Biostatistics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Indiana University Melvin And Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN Email: ggathiru@iupui.edu Objective: Metabolic syndrome (MS) becomes increasingly common primarily due to the epidemic of overweight and obesity in both developed and developing countri es. Epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of several cancers. However, it larg ely remains unclear whether the components of MS are associated with total cance r mortality. Therefore, we so ught to evaluate this important question in the Third National Health and Nutr ition Examination Survey (NHANES) . Methods: Data on demographics, socioeconomics, lifestyle factors, and the components of metabo lic syndrome were collected among 19,296 men and women aged 18 years or o lder (pregnant women excluded). Cancer mortality outcomes of these subjects were determined by linka ge to the National Death Index (NDI) through 2010. A total of 1,136 cases of all sites of cancer were documented during this period of ti me. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% co nfidence intervals (CIs) for total cancer mortality in relation to the components of MS. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, race, education, alcohol, and cigarette smoking, subjects in the highest quartil e of serum glucose CI (1.36-1.37)] experienced an increased risk of total cancer w hen compared with those in the lowest quartile. However, a reduced risk was observed for those in the highest q uartile of HDL cholesterol [HR 0.83; (0.87-0.87)]. S ubjects who were diagnosed with MS (having any 3 of the 5 components abnormal, n=5,940; 31%) had a 20% hig her risk of death from total cancer compared to those without the metabolic syndrome [HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.199-1.203)]. The risk of total cancer mortality increased with increase in abnormal MS components (pt rend <.0001). Compared with individuals without MS, HRs were 1.12, 1.28, and 1.59 for those with 3, 4, and 5 abnormal components, respectively. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the present study is among the first to demo nstrate that some components of metabolic syndrome modulate the r isk of total cancer among a la rge representative sample of the US population. Our findings offer novel evidence for the potential role of metabolic syndrome in cancer carcinogenesis and mechanistic dat a for the associations betwee n obesity and the risk of some cancers.

To facilitat e this goal, this study aimed to replicate the inverse association of cancer and AD using data from the NIA Alzheimer' s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which includes age-matched cases and controls with information on can cer history, AD progression, neuroimaging, and genomic data. Subjects inclu ded individuals with AD (n=234) , mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=542), and healthy controls ( HC, n=293). After con trolling for sex, apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) groups, cancer history was protective against b aseline AD diagnosis (p=0.042), and was associated with later age of AD onset (p=0.0 01). Cancer history appears to result in a cumulative protective effect; in dividuals with more than one ca ncer had a later age of AD onset compared to those with only one cancer (p=0.001). Finally, a protective eff ect of AD was also obser ved in individuals who developed incident cancer after enrolling (post-baseline visit) ; 20 individuals with MCI and 9 HC developed cancer, while no AD patients had subsequent cancer diagnoses (p =0.013). This supports previous research on the inverse association of cancer and AD, and importantly provi des novel evidence that this effect appears to be independent of APOE , the major known genetic risk factor for AD. Future analyses w ill investigate the neurobiological and gene tic basis of this effect.

Laura Tenner1,2 1 Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Melvin And Bren Simon Ca ncer Center, Indianapolis, IN Email: tenner2@iupui.edu Background: The steeply rising cost of cancer care in the United States ad versely impacts the economy as well as patient emotional well-being and financial stability. T he aim of this study was to assess US oncologists' attitudes and percep tions about the cost of cancer c a r e i n t h e w a k e o f A C A i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . Methods: From June through August 2013, a survey instrument was emailed to practicing oncologists in 50 states. Survey items included as sessments of self-reported prac tices concerning commun ication of cost of therapy as well as influences of the ACA. Other survey items as sessed oncologists' perceptions of cost effectiveness data. Results: The electronic survey response rate was 16% with respondents f rom 35 states. Respondents were more likely to strongly or somewhat agree that it was important to discuss out-of-pocket costs [OPC] (89%) and healthcare system costs patients, p<0.0001 . 70% reported influence tment decisions. 60% agreed that OPC and HSC of cancer treatments were likely or extremely likely to have a larger effect on their decisions regarding which cancer treatments to recommend to patients in the future under the ACA. While 4% agreed the go vernment should play a role in determining the value of a cancer therapy, 53% of respondents thought that government price controls for cancer drugs were needed. A large majority ag reed that physician education o n the use of cost-effectiveness data (91%) and communicating cost of therapies w ith patients (85%) was needed. Conclusion: US oncologists reported that they desire more cost and comparative effectiveness research as well as more education on how to communicate with patients about c osts of therapy. Respondents p erceived that both OPC and HSC will play a larger role in their cancer treatment decisions over the next f ive years, and that they w ill need to increase their communication with patients about both OPC costs as well as HSC . Respondents appeared divided on the topic of government intervention on pharmaceutical price contro ls and unified in their resolve to maintain control of decisions on the value of therapy.

Fairbank s School Of Public Health, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Email: ekwagner@iupui.edu Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class key regu latory RNAs that are greater than 200nt and do not code for protein. They appear to be critical for var ious biological processes including gene regulation. Increasing evidence has suggested that aberrantly e xpressed lncRNAs play a key role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. In most studies of breast cancer, breast tumor tissue was compared to adjacent normal-appearing tis sue to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs. However, expression of lncRNAs in normal breast tissue from healthy donors has rarely been studied, and the differences in expression of lncRNAs in breast tumor and normal breast tissue from healthy don ors remain largely unknown. Using RNA-sequencing data gene rated from freshly-frozen breast tissue samples, we ex amined the expression of lncRNAs in 119 breast tumor, 4 7 adjacent normal-appearing br east tissue samples, and 23 normal breast tissue samples from healthy donor s. Bowtie and RESM algorithms were used to align raw reads and quantify transcript abundance. Differential expression analyses were per formed using edgeR software. We assessed the expression of a total of 7,844 mapped lncRNAs using normalized transcript counts. Unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the lncRNA expressi on profile of adjacent normal-appearing tissue was different compared to normal breast tissue from heal thy donors, and partially overlapped with the tumor. At various fold change thresholds, more differentially e xpressed lncRNAs can be detected when the tumor tissue is compared to normal tissue than to adjacent non- tumorous tissue. With a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) of more than \u00b12, we identif ied 107 differentially expressed lncRNAs for the tumor vs. normal breast tissue, 53 lncRNAs for tumor vs. ad jacent normal-appearing tissue, and 20 lncRNAs for adjacent normal-appearing vs. normal breast tissue. In our analyses of tumor vs. adjacent normal-appearing tissue and tumo r vs. normal tissue from health y donors, we identifi ed ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS1 t hat were previously implicated in breast cancer, with considerably higher fold changes in latter comparison. When using normal breast tissue from healthy donors as the base line, we identified novel putati ve breast cancer-associated lncRNAs expresse d in breast tumor. These lncRNAs were not identifiable in a direct comparison of tumor and adjac ent normal-appearing tissue. Our results suggest that adjacent normal-ap pearing tissue undergoes changes in lncRNAs expression similar to those observed in tumor tissue to some extent, and a number of new an d potentially important lncRNAs can only be detected using normal tissue fro m healthy donors as an optimal baseline tissue.

All histological types of thymomas can gi ve rise to metastases albeit with different frequencies. Thymic carcinomas hav e a more aggressive behavior and metastasize earlier and more frequently than thymomas. So far, targeted therapies are not available for either of these cancers. We recently have developed and validated a nine-ge ne and a ten-gene signature to predict metastatic behavior of thymomas and thymic respectively (G\u00f6kmen- 2013; G\u00f6kmen-Polar et al, ASCO 2013 ). Pathway analysis of these signatures revealed that PDGFR is sig nificantly associated with metastatic and carcinomas. In particular , we have PDGFRL ) is down-regulated in metastatic phenotype, which acts as a hu b for tumor suppressor activity re gulating PDGF pathway signaling . Our group also demonstrated the of mTOR pathway in thymic malignancies. Using IU-T AB-1, a thymoma AB cell line and thymic carcinoma cell line 1889c, our initial efforts focused o n the in vitro efficacy of dovitinib alone, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targe ting PDGFR and FGFR and evaluate its efficacy in combination of with standard care of therapy in th ese cancers. Dovitinib alone exhi bited inhibition of cell survival at = 8.39 \u00b5M and 6.44 \u00b5M (IC 50- the concentration that inhibit 50% of cell survival) for IU-T AB-1 and 1889c, respectively. Everolimus alone, a rapalog that inhibits mTOR pa thway, was less sensitive for 1889c (IC 50 = 12.96 \u00b5M) compared to IU-TAB-1 (IC 50 = 8.69 \u00b5M). Furthermore, combination therapy with dovitinib an d everolimus reduced the cell surv ival synergistically [IU-TAB-1 (IC 50 = 1 . 9 \u00b5 M ; 1 8 8 9 c I C 50 = 3 . 5 2 \u00b5 M ) . However, treatment with everolim us increased the phosphorylatio n of AktS473 in these cells. Combinatorial therapy did not decrease the hig h level of p-Akt, suggesting it s ineffectiveness to inh ibit mTOR pathway. In conclusion, these preclinical models will provide excellent too ls to study the relevance and functional role of novel therapeutic agents as well as the rationale for combinati on therapies, and provide insight for the future treatment strategies of patients with these rare malignancies.

Methods: An Expanded Access IND was deve loped for 68Ga-DOTA-NOC, an age nt that has had extensive world-wide use in neuroendocrine t umor imaging, but which is no t available as an FDA-approved drug product in the United States. The 68Ga3+ precursor was obtained in 1.5 mL 0.1M ultrapure HCL by fractionated elution buffered by addition g) at 80\u00a7C for 10-minutes. The 68Ga-DOTA-NOC product was then isolated by C18 solid phase extraction; recovered in 0.6 mL 85% ethanol:15% saline; and diluted with additional sterile saline (12 mL) prior to terminal sterilizing filtration into a sterile evacuated vial. Quality control measu res, and release criteria, followed the specifications of the published EANMMI Procedure Guidelines for such 68Ga-agents (Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 37:2004-2010; 2010). Results: The 68Ga-DOTA-NOC radiopharmaceutical was prepared for PET/CT imaging in 39 patients (adm inistered dose: 4.7 \u00b1 0.6 mCi ; 174 \u00b1 22 MBq) during the first year of the IND. Total synthesis time, from ge nerator elution to post-QC re lease of final sterile product, averaged 46 \u00b1 5 minutes, with a product radiochemical purity of 98.2 \u00b1 0.7%. 68 Ge breakthrough in the final product has been at or near the background count rate, averaging 3.0 \u00b1 3.7 x 10- 7% at the dose expiration time. Conclusions: The manual synthesis approach has been effective for 68Ga-DOTA- NOC production, addressing a local clinical need for imaging to ass ess the location and extent of disease in neuroendocrine cancer patients being considered for surgery.

Therefore, an important stra tegy to effectively control the toxic side effects would be to equip the T-cells prior to re-infusion with a suicide gene that will enable directed elimination of the e ngineered T-cells in vivo in the patient by inducing apoptosis. The prototype suicide gen e, established more than 15 years ago for donor lymphocyte infusio ns (DLIs) in an allogeneic stem cell transplantation setting, is the thymidine kinase from the herpe s simplex virus type 1 (HSV-tk) used in combination with its prodrug, th e antiviral substa nce ganciclov ir (GCV). The HSV-tk/GCV system has been successfully employed in clinical phase I/II trials for control of DLI-induced GvHD. However, some groups a l s o r e p o r t e d t h a t t h e u s e f u l n e s s o f t h i s s y s t e m w a s l i m i t e d b y the strong immunogenicity of the HSV-tk p r o t e i n t h a t c a n l e a d t o t h e r a p i d e l i m i n a t i o n o f t h e g e n e t i c a l ly modified T-cells, even after stem cell transplantation, and by the fact that ganciclovir is paramount for the treatment of viral infections or reactivations after transplantation. We developed a novel human suici de gene by systematically optim izing the inactive P450 family ocess the agent. Using lenti virus-mediated expression in human liver cells and primary T-cells, we dem onstrate that systematically a ltering single amino acids in the human CYP4B1 protein renders the enzyme as active as the rabbit CYP4B 1 protein, the most active isoform of CYP4B1 known in mammals, for processing 4-IPO and thereby induc ing cell death within 24 to 72h. Our human suicide gene is especially interesting for use with recen t adoptive cell therapy strategies, because a critical advantage for use in T- cell therapies is that the CYP4 B1 suicide gene system mediates a proliferation- independent eliminatio n of cells without ma jor bystander effect s for the surrounding tissue/cells.

Scott Boswell, Zhong-Yin 1 Pediatrics, Medicine, IN Email: mkobayas@iu.edu The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) ses, consisting of PRL1, PRL2, and PRL3, represents an intriguing group of proteins being validated as t herapeutic targets in solid tumors. While PRL2 is overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its rol e in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is largely unknown. Recently, we reported that PRL2 regulates hema topoietic stem cell self-renewal through regulating SCF/KIT signaling (Kob ayashi et al., Stem Cells, 201 4). To define the role of PRL2 in the pathogenesis of AML, null and performed in vitro and in vivo assays. We discovered that Prl2 null Lin- cells expressing KITD814V or FLT3-ITD mutant show decreased proliferation compared with w ild-type cells in the a bsence of cytokine. Moreover, PRL2 deficiency significantly delayed the leukemogene sis induced by KITD814V in vivo , mediated cells in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo . Furthermore, we observed increased level of PRL2 proteins in some AML cell lines and inhibition of PRL2 activity with a PRL2-specific small molecule inhibitor (PRLi) results in decreased proliferation an d apoptotic cell death of human AML cell lines expressing PRL2. Importantly, we found that primary human AML c ells isolated from patients with FLT3- ITD positive and normal karyotype AML are sensitive to PRL2 inhibitor treatment in a dosage- dependent manner, suggesting that human AML cells are dependent on PRL2 activity for proliferation and survival. PRL2 is a dual specificity protein phosphatase. Howev er, the substrates of PRL2 are largely unknown. To identify novel targets ofPRL2 activity in AML, we p erformed protein phosp cells, including KIT, SHP2, CBL and PLC-g. We found that the levels of pAKT and pERK1/2 are signifi cantly lower in Prl2 null Kit+ cells compared with those in wild-type cells. When we overexpressed w ild-type or the catalytic inactive mutant form of PRL2 (PRL2/C101S) in Lin- cells isolated from Prl2 null mice, we found that wild-type PRL2, but not the mutant PRL2, augments pAKT and pERK1/2 levels in Prl2 null Lin- cells, indicating that the ability of PRL2 to enhance cytokine signa ling in hematopoietic on its phosphatase activity. Mechanistically, PRL2 y in decreased KIT SCF stimulation, possibly through dephosphorylating Thus, PRL2 phosphatase is an important mediator of oncogenic signaling in AML and may be a druggable target in mye loproliferative disease (MPD) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with onc KIT and Research DEVELOPMENT SE IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYELOID Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University School Of Medicine Email: mczader@iupui.edu Background: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of all ogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and together with immunosuppressive thera py is implicated in the impaired immune reconstitution. Select parameters of immune function and their relation to the clinical outcomes including GVHD have been previously studied. However, only rare reports e xplore the relationship between early bone marrow (BM) morphologic and immun ophenotypic findings and the i ncidence of GVHD. In this study, we evaluated the histopathologic features of bone marrow biopsies and lymphocyte subpopulations in a cohort of patients post allogeneic HCT, and compared these to the develop ment of acute and chronic GVHD (aGVHD and cGVHD). Design: Post-HCT BM specimens and blood at day +30 and/or day +1 00 were retrospectively examined in 98 patients who received either myeloablative or no nmyeloablative HCT for acute fibrosis, bone formation, the presence o f osteoclasts, myeloid:erythr oid ratio, % lymphocytes and % hematogones. B o n e m a r r o w l y m p h o c y t e s u b s e t s ( C D 2 0 + B - c e l l s , C D 3 + T - c e l l s , C D 4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK-cells and stage I hematogones) were quan titated by flow cytometry. These results were correlated with laboratory data, and the presence or abse nce of aGVHD and cGVHD. Results: The study included 98 patients (4 9 males and 49 females; median age 48; age range 17-67 years). There were 32 and 39 patients with aGVHD and cGVHD, respectivel y. Patients with cGVHD had significantly lower numbers of stage I hematogones (p=0.002; 0. 49% vs 1.76% for patients with and without cGVHD respectively). cGVHD was also associated with higher BM a diposity (mean 45%, vs 36% without cGVHD; p=0.02). was a tren for cellularity in thos e with cGVHD (p=0.05). Other morphologic parameters were not statistically significantly different betwe en cases with and without cGVHD. There was also no correlation between histo pathologic parameters and lymp hocyte subsets, and the presence of aGVHD. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that there is an increased incidence of cGVHD among post-HCT patients with lower numbers of stage I hematogones, increased r eplacement of the BM space with adipocytes and lower cellularity. Further st udies are needed to determine whether monitoring of these parameters can be useful in guiding GVHD prophylaxis.

As there h as been limited investigation of the neural substrate of these deficits, this study examined WM-related brain activation after ALL chemothera py using functional MRI (fMRI) and assessed the relationship to academic performance. Methods: 23 children >3 years post ALL chemotherapy (mean age 11.7 years, 10 female) and 21 demographically matched HC (mean age 12.8 years, 13 female) completed an fMRI auditory-verbal n-back WM task, neuropsycholo gical (NP) testing, and parent behavioral ratings (CBCL and BRIEF). Data were analyzed using SPM8 and SPS S version 21. Results: ALL patients evidenced lower processing spee d, executive function, and globa l NP scores than HC. Parent ratings were elevated for ALL relative to HC only for the BRIEF emotional co ntrol scale. Groups had comparable n-back performance, but ALL patients showed greater brain activation t han HC during the most challenging WM condition (2-back), particularly in frontal regions. Within the ALL group, increased frontal activation correlated with better task perfo rmance. Relative to those with out parent-reported academic difficulty, ALL patients with academic difficulty showed lower frontal lobe act ivation, 2-back perform ance, verbal memory, and global NP functioning, and higher parental concerns on seve ral CBCL and BRIEF scales. Conclusion: In the context of comparable task performance, the finding of grea ter frontal brain activation in children after ALL chemotherapy relative to HC suggests compensatory recruitme nt of neural circuitry to support WM processing. This interpretatio n is supported by a positive corr elation between frontal activation and task performance in the ALL group. ALL patients with academic diffic ulty showed lower frontal activation and greater cognitive and behavioral concerns, demonstrating a puta tive neural correlate o f chemotherapy-related changes, and potential for treatment or remediation appr oaches.

The rates of tobacco use in our state are among the highest in the nation, r endering staggering economical and societal cost. The main goal of the TPT wo rking group is to engage a mul tidisciplinary approach that leverages local t a l e n t a n d r e s o u r c e s t o p r e v e n t t h e d e v e l o p m e n t a n d i m p r o v e t h e outcomes of tobacco-related cancers in Indiana. The working group will address both the societal and i ndividual impact of tobacco exposure and morbidity in Indiana, undertaking epidemiological and biologica l approaches to study two major areas: Prevention and Early detection as well as Control and Treatment . Distinct goals of the TPT working group are: 1) To increase primary prev ention of tobacco and similar c arcinogens such as bio mass, smokeless tobacco (e-cigarettes), or shisha use in Indiana. 2) To increase the ra tes of cessation of tobacco use in Indiana. 3) To understand the biology of addictio n to tobacco. 4) To optimize local lung cancer screeni ng implementation. 5) To develop individualized managem ent approaches to improve outc omes of tobacco-related cancers. 5) To understand individual risk of d eveloping a specific lung cancer phenotype, and individualized responses to therapy. Our approach is to identify appropriate stakeholders and engage them in a t eam approach to formulate action and research plans, and pursue their implement ation. The following projects have been identified as initial areas of action: For Prevention of s moking initiation, we will focus on pre-teen targeting. We will use educational initiativ es targeting church groups, yo uth groups, and sports teams; we will engage school nurses association, community nurses; and student nurses . To enhance Smoking Cessation, we will pursue educational initiatives and efforts to synergize or inte grate current resources on campus, including the Indiana University Health, VA Med ical Center, State Health, and Indiana Cancer Consortium. Planned research studies related to this topic are the pharmacogenomics of nicotine cessation drugs; and the impact of implementation of tele-health in remote rural areas to enhance smoking cessation. Another major area of attention will be the a ssessment and integration of existent Lu ng Cancer Screening I nitiatives and pursue research related to appropr iate implementation. The short term milestones of the TPT working group will be the implementation of productive working teams of investigators ; successful internal and extramural grant applications; recruitment of juni or investigators to the workin g group; and increased visibility on campus as a useful local resource for tob acco-related policies and initiati ves. Long term milestones are measurable decreases in rates of tobacco use by the general population and high school students in particular which will likely translate in decreased rates of lung cancer diagnosis an d lung cancer mortality in Indiana.

Th e relationship of current histological subtyping with prognosis is poorly defined, suppor ting the need for a deeper understanding of transcriptional biology to develop targeted therapies. To addre ss this, we performed next-generation RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional landscape of this dis ease. Experimental Design: RNA was sequenced from 13 thymic malignanc ies and 3 normal thymus gland s. Validation of microRNA expression was performed on a separate set of 35 thymomas using qPCR. For cell based studies, a thymoma AB cell line (IU-TAB1) was used. Results: Hierarchical clusteri ng revealed 100% concordance between gene expression subtype. A subsequent clustering of 705 precur sor-microRNAs also showed substantial concordance between clusters and subtype. By analyzing the dend rograms, A & AB tumors were significantly different from other thymomas. A substantial differentiator was a large microRNA cluste r on chr19q13.42 that was significantly over-expressed i n all A & AB tumors and whose expression was virtually absent in the other thymomas and normal tissues. Over-expression of this microRNA c luster, which is normally silent in adult tissues, hyperactivates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Treatment of IU-TAB1 cells, the only known thymoma AB cell line, with a panel of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors resulted in marked reduction of cell viability suggesting sensit ivity to these agents. Conclusions: A large microRNA cluster on chr19q13.42 is a transcriptional hallmark of type A & AB thymomas. Furthermore, this cluster activates the PI3K pathway, suggesting the possible explorati on of PI3K inhibitors in patie nts with these s ubtypes of tumor.

Fluorescence imaging of indocyanine green (ICG) dye is a novel feasible modality for SL N mapping. The FIRES trial (fluorescence imaging for robotic endometrial cancer sentinel node mapping) i s a prospective, multicenter cohort study of comprehensively staged women with endometrial cancer. The prima ry objective of the trial is to estimate the sensitivity and negativ e predictive value (NPV) of SLNs for det ecting metastatic disease. Methods: Patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer undergoing robotic sta ging received cervical injection of ICG (1 mg) and both SLN mapping and pelvic para-aortic (PA) lymphadenectom y. All histologies and grades were eligible. All lymph nodes were e valuated with hematoxylin and e cytoker atin. This study has ongoing re cruitment at seven United States centers. It is registered with Clinical Trials.gov. Results: 109 eligible patients have unde rgone attempted SLN mapping. The mean body mass index of the cohort is 35.2. Pelvic lymphade nectomy was performed in 106 patients (97%) and PA lymphadenectomy in 73 patients (69%). Three patien ts had aborted mapping and no nodes removed due to inability to perfo rm lymphadenectomy; 96 patient s (90.5%) had successfu l mapping (at least one SLN identified). Bilateral SLN s were identified in 66 of th ese patients (69%). The median number of SLNs was 4 (range, 0-15). A medi an number of 23 (range, 2-61) t otal LNs were removed per patient. Thirteen (12%) patients had stage IIIC di sease, 11 of whom mapped a SLN. Among those who mapped, nodal metastases were correctly identif ied in the SLNs in all cases, yielding a sensitivity and NPV of 100%. Isolated PA metastatic disease was SLNs . (7) of nodal metastases were identified with ultrastaging pathology techniques. Conclusions: The interim results of the FIRES trial show a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for SLNs identified w ith robotic fluorescence imaging in women with endometrial cancer. There w ere no false-negative SLNs in p atients who mapped. Replacement of complete lymphadenectomy for SLN biopsy is not advocated until the study's statistical endpoints have been met.

Previous work from our lab has established the murine multidrug resistance-2 mouse (MDR2) mode l of HCC as a reasonable preclinical model that parallels the changes seen in human inflammatory ass ociated HCC (ref). Methods : 18F-FDG and 11C-acetate PET/CT 12m MDR2-/- HCC MDR2-/+ HCC. In addition, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lysophosphatid ic acid (LPA), cAMP and hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) were quantified in 3-12m MDR2-/- mice using commercia lly available ELISA kits. Results: Hepatic18F-FDG metabolism was not signi ficantly increased in MDR2-/- mice. In contrast, hepatic 11C-acetate metabolism was significantly increased in MDR2-/- mice when compared to MDR2+/- controls. Serum AFP and LPA levels increased in MDR2-/- m i c e c o n t e m p o r a n e o u s w i t h t h e e m e r g e n c e o f HCC on imaging. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in serum cAMP levels and an increase in hepatic TNFa. Conclusion: HCC imaging by 11C-acetate PET/CT in MDR2-/- mouse model tracks well with the clinical characteristics of human HCC where we have seen se rologic markers and C11 acetate uptake with the emergence of liver cancer. It is reasonable to consider usi ng11C-acetate PET/CT in evaluating extent of disease burden as well as tumor r esponse after intervention.

We provide experti s e i n e x p e r i m e n t a l d e s i g n , c a r r y o u t t h e procedures, and assist with analyses and interpretation. These state-of-the-art technologies have enabled a large number of grants to be funded over the years, and have re sulted in a very large nu mber of publications. Our next-generation sequencing technology includes SOLiD5500xl, Ion Proton and Ion Torrent PGM (Personal Genome Machine). This set of instruments covers a wid e range of next-generation sequencing capabilities from small bacterial genomes to the whole human ge nome, transcriptome (total RNA), small RNA, targeted DNA fragments, exome, ChIP-seq, and methyl-seq. W e have generated sequencing data for 52 projects over the past two years. Our SNP genotyping facility, using the Sequenom MassArray platform, specializes in targeted genotyping of 20-30 SNPs per assay and is an excellent choice for candidate gene studies and for following up results from GWAS and next-generat ion sequencing. It has been a central part of several large, multi-site collabo rative genetic studies, includ ing Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), bipolar disorder, osteoporosis and hype rtension, as well as many smalle r projects; it is most efficient for sets of approximately 370 samples. We have produced more than 20 millio n targeted SNP genotypes to date. This platform is also capable of meas uring allele-specific gene expr ession, and targeted quantitative for epigenetics study. For many projects, microarra ys offer a good alternative to next-generation sequencing for measuring gene expression. We use Affymetrix Gen eChip microarrays, capable of measuring expression of nearly all genes in humans (and all exons within them), rats, mice and most model organisms, and can measure expression of mi RNAs. We can also use RNA extra cted from FFPE samples.

These changes ca n be characterized as either an increased or decreased expression due to aging, that translate to increased or decreased function in ord er to have an impact on patient response to chemotherapy. Although some of these changes in drug metabolizi ng enzyme expression have been previously observed, the mechanis m responsible for these change s is unknown. In order to determine the cause of these changes in drug disposition, we focused on devel opmentally changing miRNAs in the liver, the primary site of drug metabolism. These miRNAs, through imperfec t complimentary binding to the 3' UTR of the targeted mRNA, cause transla tional repression or degradatio n. We measured expression of 533 miRNAs in 90 human liver samples (30 fetal, 30 pediatric, 30 adult) us ing TaqMan Open Arrays . After correction for multiple testing using false disc overy rate, 121 m iRNAs were up regulated and 119 were downregulated from fetal to pediatric/adult populations and 2 and 3 from pediatric to adult. Next, using Ingenuity Program Analysis to predict miRNA target s among regulatory genes (HNF4A , PXR, CAR) and the top 32 ADME metab olism, excretion) genes determi ned from PharmaADME, there were 132 miRNA-mRNA interactions either predicted or experimentally vali dated involving 85 miRNAs and 28 genes. These targeted mRNAs included many of the Phase I enzymes (CYP4 50s), Phase II enzymes (GSTs, 2-fold from pedi atric to adult, was confirmed to target HNF4A, a transcriptional regulator of drug disposition genes. F urthermore, a SNP in the miRNA binding site of HNF4A was shown to reduce miRNA negative regulation by hsa-m iR-34a, therefore causing an increase in HNF4A and its downstream targets such as CYP2D6, responsible in activation of tamoxifen, first line treatment for breast cancer. We retrospectively genotyped a coh ort previously probed for CYP2D6 activity using dextromethorphan and showed that this SNP in HNF4A abolis hed the miRNA binding site and resulted in increased CYP2D6 activity. Collectively, this data suggests that age-related changes in miRNA expression have the ability to regulate dru g metabolism and disposition by targeting enzymes and transporters directly or indirectly through upstream regu latory genes. Furthermore, SNPs in the miRNA binding sites within the 3' UTR of targeted enzymes, transpor ters, and regulatory genes mRN A, can also contribute to variable drug response in chemotherapy drugs metabolized in the liver. With t he knowledge of validated miRNA-mRNA interactions and characterization of SNPs involved in creating or abolishing miRNA binding sites, personalized medicine across the age spectrum can be further ad vanced.

Its overall survival r ate of 6% underscores the need for improved therapies.Cancer cell proliferat ion and cell-cycle dysregulatio n is a major target in cancer treatment. Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and cyc lin inhibitors act as anti-prolif erative agents that target upregulated cell-cycle progression proteins in various tumors. The efficacy of PD03329 91, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, is currently being investigated in clinical trials in patients with retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-positive breast, ovarian, and non- small-cell lung cancers but has not yet been examined for treat ment in PDAC. We have recently shown that PD0332991 inhibits cell proliferation in PDAC cell lines but in itiates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induces cancer cell invasion in some of these cells. Using human PDAC tissues and tissues from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC, we also re cently showed that loss of RB function is common in PDAC. To further assess the therapeutic potential of PD0332991 in PDAC, we now compared its effects in PANC-1 human PDAC cells (wild-type RB1 gene) and in murine PDAC cells devoid of Rb that were derived from a GEMM expressing mutantKRASG12D and devoid of RB(KRC mice). In PANC-1 cells, PD0332991 (1 \u00b5M) inhibited proliferation and induced EMT. By co ntrast, in KRC 1022-4 murine PDAC cells, the same concentration of PD0332991 induced EMT without altering proliferation. Moreover, removal of PD0332991 from the incubation medium reversed its growth inh ibitory actions in PANC-1 cells, but did not reverse its effects on EMT in either PANC-1 or KRC 1022-4 c ells. Taken together, these findings suggest that PD0332991 may exert long term deleterious effects in patie nts with PDAC limiting its potential therapeutic use in this deadly cancer, except in conjunction wi th agents that target EMT.

To safely and eff iciently target the cholesterol esterification in cancer cells, we developed a cholesteryl in while elevating intracellular free cholesterol le vels, which led to apoptosis a nd suppression of prolifera tion in a wide range of human cancer cell lines. Furtherm o r e , w i t h i m p r o v e m e n t o f t h e w ater-solubility of Avasimibe by up to 40 times, Avasimin can be intravenously injected at high concentra tion, which increases the bioavailability of Avasimibe in blood and tumor compared to standard oral administ ration. Systemic treatment of Avasimin notably suppressed tumor growth and also extended the length of survival time in mouse models of human prostate and colon cancers. No adverse effects of Avasimin trea tment to normal cells, blood components, and organs were observed. Thus, this study shows a new clinically v iable strategy for cancer selective chemotherapy by targeting altere d cholesterol metabolism of can cer cells.

We performed pr oteomic analysis to identify biomarkers using plasma taken 14 days prior to clinical manifestations of GI-GVHD. We selected candidates that were increased at least 1.5 fold in plasma taken from GI-GVHD patien ts compared to HSCT patients motif ligand 14 (CCL14) and CD146 were the two lead candidates. CCL14 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR5 on T cells. CD146 is expressed by a ctivated T cells and endothelial cells. We analyzed peripheral blood cells from 214 HSCT patients (71 GI-G VHD, 48 No GVHD, 33 non-GVHD enteritis, 22 skin first GVHD, 40 isolated skin GVHD) at onset of symptoms. The frequency of CD146+CCR5+T cells was significantly increase d in GI-GVHD patients compare d to patients without GVHD (p<0.001), but not with skin first and then GI-GVHD (p=0.28). We then classified patients into low and high-risk groups according to the median CD146+CCR5+ frequency in GI-GVHD patients (2.3%). A high frequency of CD14 6+CCR5+T cells predicted higher 6-month non-relapse mort ality in patients who eventually d e v e l o p e d G I - G V H D ( 4 2 % v s . 2 0 % , p=0.02). We then further characterized this population. In pati CD146+CCR5+T cells had a Th1 and Th17 phenotype (ROR+T-bet+) compared to CD146-CCR5-T cells. They also expressed a higher level of the activation marker ICOS (p=0.01). In vitro, naive T cells differ entiated with both Th17 inducing cytokines and ICOS stimulation increased the percentage of CD146+CCR5+T cells (expressed hereafter as % mean\u00b1SEM) compared to naive T cells differe ntiated ells differentiated with both Th17 and ICOS also co-expressed more T h1 and markers (IL-22, CD161, Compared BATF, IL-23R). no (Th1, Th17, CD28, or ICOS), sorted CD146+ cells always co- expressed more Th1 and Th17 cytokines as compared to sorted CD1 46- T cells, further suggesting that the CD146+ T cell subset is Th17 prone. We conclude that CD146+CCR5+T cell frequency is a cellular biomarker of GI-GVHD with prognostic value. ICOS is critical for the deve lopment of this CD146+CCR5+T cell population. This subset is Th17 biased. CCR5, ROR, and ICOS ar e drug-targetable and may represent new avenues to treat GVHD.

Current treatments are compromised by adverse side effect s. Fortunately, most prostate cancer cells overexpress the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), whereas the receptor is present at low or undetectable levels in normal cells. This difference could be taken advantage of in order to selectively deliver non-specific cytotoxic drugs to these pathogenic cells while sparing normal cells that lack PSMA, thu s improving potencies and reducing toxicities. PSMA is a very attractive therapeutic target that has high affi nity for the ligand 2-[3-(1,3-Dicarboxypropyl) -Ureido]Pentanedioic Acid (DUPA) (K a DUPA-drug conjugate, PSMA internalizes, unloads the conjuga te, and returns to the surface . A release mechanism that would facilitate the intracellular cleavage of indeno isoquinoline topoisomerase I in hibitors from their DUPA conjugates was investigated in the present stu dy. A suitable peptide linker wa s added as a spacer between the drug and the DUPA ligand in order to ensure the binding of PSMA and its liga nd. In order to provide preliminary support for this methodology, two indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I in hibitors and their DUPA conjugates were synthesized and tested in both LNCaP and 22RV1 cell cultures, b oth of which overexpress PSMA. All of the compounds exhibited GI 50 values in the low nanomolar range. The efficacy in an animal m odel was determined by administering one of the two DUPA-drug conjugates to 22RV1 tumor xenograft-bearing mice, and the results showed a complete cessation of tumor growth and no toxicity (loss of body weight or death of mice) during the treatment period. The results demonstrate that it is possible to selectively target cytotoxic indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitors to prostate cance r cells while reducing adverse side effects to normal tissues.

Although CIPN and cognitive dysfunction are often vi ewed as separate phenomena, w e hypothesized that these effects may be related. Methods Breast cancer patients treated with (Ctx+, n=27) and without ( Ctx-, (HC, n=26) were assayed post-surgery, pre- treatment and one month post-treatment. All but Ctx+ treatment included paclitaxel or docetaxel. Periph eral neuropathy symptom severity (PNS) with the sum of the self-reported FACT/GOG-Ntx 11-ite m scale, cerebral gray matter density (GMD) and perfusion were asses sed using MRI, and cognitive comp laints, depression, and fatigue were assessed with the Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire (M ASQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and the Fatigue Symptom Inventory. Results: Chemotherapy treatment was associated with increased PNS and cognitive complaints (p<0.01), which remained significant after adjusting for fatigue and depression. PNS was associated with increased cerebral perfusio n in the left anterior cingulate (LAC) gyrus, a region associated with pain processing. Interestingly, a previo usly published Ctx+ frontal GMD decrease in this cohort was correlated with the LAC perfusion change (p<0.0 1) and PNS change (p<0.01). Individuals with GMD decrease showed lower LAC perfusion and fewer PNS, whi le increased PNS were correlated with increased cognitive complaints ( p<0.05) and depression and fati gue (both p<0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study to identify cerebral perfusion change associated wi th peripheral neuropathy symptoms in a breast cancer cohort. Our findings suggest that chemotherapy-associate d gray matter decrease may also reduce LAC perfusion and associated pain pe rception. This finding and the observed relationships between CIPN symptoms, depression, fatigue, and cognitive complaints highlig ht the importance of further research on the causal pathways underlying these effects, and of developing the rapies targeting this symptom cluster.

As epigenetic r egulators play a major role in the control of normal stem cell differentiation, epigenetics may play a critic al role in targeting this subpopulation. Epigenetic aberrations, especial ly DNA methylation, result in s ilencing of tumor suppressor and differentiation-associated genes and regulate ovarian cancer st em cell (OCSCs) survival. To test the hypothesis that DNA hypomethylating agents \"reset\" OCSCs toward s differentiation, we investigated the effect of the new DNA methytransferase inhibitor SGI-110 on OCS Cs, defined as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH)(+) cells. We demonstrated that ALDH(+) OC cells possess multiple stem cell characteristics, were highly chemoresistant, and were enriched in xenografts residual after plati num therapy. Low dose SGI-110 reduced the stemness properties of ALDH(+) cells, including the ir tumor initiating capacity, resensitized these OCSCs to platinum, and induced re-expression of differentiation -associated genes. Maintenance treatment with SGI-110 after carboplatin inh ibited OCSCs, caused profound global tumor hypomethylation, and delayed tumor progression, supporting epigenomic targeting as a novel s trategy after platinum-based therapy in OC. Collectively, our data suggest that a strategy targeting DNA me thylation in OC exerts potent anti-tumor activity by allowing elimination of OCSCs enriched in residual, platinum resistant tumors. Our study provides the first evidence that epigenom e targeting strategies delay tu mor progression by targeting and reprogramming residual cancer stem cells, suggesting that SGI-110 in combinat ion with platinum has the potential to prevent recurrent and chemoresistant OC.

Hsin-Jung Wu, Sunil Tholpady1, Dan Spandau2, John Foley3 1 IUPUI School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Dermatology/ IUPUI School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Dermatology/ IUPUI School Of Medicine, Bloomington, IN Email: hsinwu@umail.iu.edu Mastectomy still is a common ou tcome for breast cancer patients , occurring in ~1/3 of the 1.5 million cases worldwide. While breast reconstruction is becoming more routine , approaches for replacement of the nipple still lag behind. The nipple is the aesthetic focal point of th e breast, and similar to lip, palm and sole, it is an example of specialized skin. Sites of specialized skin are char acterized by epidermal layers with reduced numbers of appendages, distinct stratification and unique kerat in expression. In addition, skin of the nipple exhibits extracellular matrix w ith higher carbohydrate content and smaller collagen bund les, a denser capillary network, increased numbers of nerve fibers, monocytes, mast cel ls, as well as dermal melanocytes. Since all of these characteristics are dependent on the inductive and sup portive capacity of the connective tissue fibroblasts, we hypothesized that these cells would express a u nique subset of growth factors relative to dermis. To examine this, we used the nipple-like ventral skin o f the keratin 14 promoter driven parathyroid hormone related protein transgenic mouse (K14-PTHrP) as a sourc e to probe gene expression from these unique fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were isolated from the K14-PTHr P mice and the ventral skin of wild-type littermates using fluorescent ac tivated cell sorting for CD140. RNA was purified and subject to microarray with the Mouse Gene 1.0 ST chip. Analysis of the gene expressio n profile revealed more than 500 genes that were differentially regulated gre ater than 2-fold in nipple fib roblasts as compared to the wild type, including extracellular matrix genes, growth factors, cytokines and sever al hormone receptors.As anticipated, nipple stromal cells express a profile o f genes consistent with reduce d canonical Wnt signaling, as has been reported for fibroblasts from the palm and the sole. Interestingly, tumo r growth factor-beta 1(TGF) levels were reduced and a key regulated tran script hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was up-regulated in nipple fibroblasts. We confirmed that HGF is highly expressed in nipple and nipple- like ventral skin of K14-PTHrP mouse in vitro and in vivo but not in keratinocytes. Moreover, HGF is further up-regulate d in the nipple during growth of the structure associated with pregnancy and lactation. HGF h a s a b r o a d s p e c t r u m o f e f f e c t s o n t i s s u e serving as a key epithelial morphogen, altering wound healing p roperties and influencing pigmentation. We have therefore focused on the TG F/HGF ratio for tissue engineer ing approaches to nipple regeneration. Translational/Clincal Research Graduate StudentPage 11 4of #114 A POTENTIAL SIMPLE BLO OD TEST FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS chromosomal telomere length. Telomerase activity has been shown to be very low or absent in human non-m alignant somatic cells, however, is activated in nearly 90% of human cancers . Therefore, telomerase has been proposed to be a useful diagnostic marker for cancer. In this study, we investigated whether the presence of cancer correlates with telomerase activity in the corresponding plasma, thus representing a surrogate serological maker for cancer patients. Plasma telomerase activity was measured by the TRAP (Telomeric Repeat Amplificati on Protocol) assay in 5 patients with colon cancer, 6 patients with breast cancer, and 7 healthy control su bjects. The TRAP is a PCR-based method and takes only a few hours to obtain the results. Our preliminary d ata show a trend that telomerase activity in plasma distinguishes between healthy subjects and cancer patien ts. Thus, our finding provides an idea that a useful blood test for cancer diagn osis may be developed using t he TRAP assay in plasma. Further case-control studies are necessary to assess the current outcome. Translational/Clincal Research Medical StudentPage 11 5of 12 UNILOBAR YTTRIUM - 90 RADIOEMBOLIZATION H CARCINOMA. William Lea1, Mark Tann1, Matthew Johnson1 1 Radiology, School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: jarebail@iupui.edu Purpose: To determine individual lesion dose-specific multi (MDCT) response unilo bar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: Immediate-post therapy MDCT ima ges of patients who underwent u nilobar Y90 for HCC between February 2011 and July 2012 and had 6 month follow up MDCT scans were evaluated. Individual tumors within the tr eated volumes were measured usin g WHO, RECIST, mRECIST, EASL criteria. Y90 activity on corres ponding immediate-post-Y90 PET images was measured, converted into dose maps using voxel based S value MIRD methodology, and individual lesion dose was calculated using both mean lesion and voxel threshold dose schemes. 6 month follow up triple phase MDCT imaging was evaluated using the same measurement criteri a and each lesion was labeled as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Results: 34 patients with 71 HCC lesions underwent unilobar Y90 therapy with accep table post procedural PET/CT. 29 patients with 61 lesions were included. 61 included lesions with an average follow up of 222 days (SE \u00f1 61 .7 days) received a mean dose of 206 Gy (SE \u00f1 172 Gy) with minimum and maximum lesion doses of 30 and 1091 Gy. We observed a significant dose- reponse relationship for volume, mRECIST and 3D EASL measuremen ts (all p values <0.05). 3D EASL: CR will be achieved with 70% and 90 % probability when 31%, [25%] and [200 Gy] respectively. The fractional response sharp ly improved beyond 150 Gy. Conclusion: Lesion PR and CR are achievable through unilobar radioembolizat ion with increasing dose. 3D EASL and mRECIST suggest lower doses are necessary to achieve 90% likeli hood of CR when compared to RECIST, WHO, and volume measurements. 3D EASL suggests 90% CR is achiev able when 77% of a lesion receives 175 Gy. Voxel dose based evaluations suggest individual interna l likely alters BUT NOT SK3, CORRELATE WITH SURVIVAL A. Liotta3 1 IU School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Rizzoli Orthopedic In stitute, Bologna, Italy, 3 George Mason University, Manassas, VA Email: achiechi@iupui.edu Tumor colonization in bone is a main cause of cancer associated pain and mortality. Despite progress in the understanding of the pathophysiolo gy of bone metastasis, it rem ains incurable. Previous studies indicate the specific involvement of the Rece ptor 1 of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNFR1) in the onset of bone metastasis and the existence of a ligand-dependent and a ligand-independent si gnaling through TNFR1. Recently, the SK3- Orai1 complex has been implicated in human cancer cell migratio n and bone metastasis in mouse models. SK3 is a Ca2+-activated K+ channel that pairs with Orai1, a Ca2+ channel, in the lipid raf t. We hypothesize that the activation of the SK3-Orai1 complex enhances TNFR1 signalin g in bone metastasis by an increased shedding of the receptor due to t he higher concentration of Ca2+ inside the cell. In this study we aim to identify 1) the level of involvement of TNFR1 and SK3 in bone m etastasis and effect on survival, 2) prognostic biomarkers, and 3) nov el therapeutic targets. 143 bo ne metastases frozen samples from different types of primary tumors (22 sarcomas and 12 head/neck, 35 uroge nital, 15 gastrointestinal, 12 breast, 23 lung, 7 melanoma, and 16 unknown carcinomas) were collected at the Is tituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. Each specimen was lysed and were used to quantify the l evel of TNFR1 and SK3 by Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA). Metastases from different primary tu mors showed similar levels of expression for TNFR1 and SK3 across tissue types (Kruskal-Wallis analysis) , except for a higher expression of TNFR1 in metastases from sarcomas. Spearman's comparison analysis showed no correlation between TNFR1 and SK3 expressions, both in the total data set and in each primary tum or group. TNFR1 expression levels were statistically correlated to patie nts' survival after diagnosis of bone metastasis (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p<0.0001). No correlation was f ound between SK3 expression and patients' survival (p=0.2011). Our data suggest a major role for TNFR1 i n the bone metastatic disease. No direct influence on patients' survival has been seen for SK3. Further exper iments will determine whether a nd how SK3 expression contributes to TNFR1 signaling. Animal models of bone metastasis will be used to investigate the effects of a TNFR1- inhibitor therapy on the onset and progression of bone metastas is.

In either definitive or adjuvant settings, proper RT coverage of these lesions involves unnecessary treatment of large volumes of normal brain. We propose a class solution which has not been previously described for thes e lesions using proton therapy (PrT). Materials/Methods: The records of the IU Health Proton Therapy Center were review e d f o r p a t i e n t s presenting between 1 January 2005 and 1 October 2013 with midli ne central nervous system (CNS) lesions. Twenty-four patients were iden tified. After institutional revie w board approval was granted, their dosimetry was reviewed for target volume doses and OAR dose avoidance. Results: Most of these cases were meningiomas (8 cases); the next most prevalent were craniophary ngiomas (6 cases). The others were various different deep mid-line brain tumors (10 cases). In all cases, fields formed by vertex and anterior and/or posterior superior oblique PrT b eams along the mid-sagittal pla ne were used to provide coverage with minimal dose to the brainstem de ep, or to the cerebral hemisphe res. The median prescribed dose to target PTV for treating these patients was 54.0 Gy RBE (range 48.6 to 62.5 Gy RBE) with a mean dose of 53.5 Gy RBE. The average of the mean doses to the brainstems using these fie lds in the twenty-four plans was 17.3 Gy RBE (range 0.0 Gy to 44.7 Gy RBE). S imilarly, the average of the me an doses to the hippocampi was 15.8 Gy RBE (range 0.0 Gy to 52.6 Gy RBE). Conclusions: We consider these patients to b e optimally treated with proton radiotherapy (PrT) and preferentially refer patients p ossible. The use of modified mid-sagittal PrT schemas allows for treatment of midline CNS lesions with sparin g of most of the uninvolved brain.

We pres ent the update of our single institution SBRT experience outcomes and toxicity . This is thought to be the lar gest single institution experience present in the literature. Patients and Methods: We treated 81 patients 89 different times, for a total of 106 lesions. Inclusion criteria were patients with 1-3 liver metastases with out evidence of extra-hep atic progression, and at least 700 cc of liver (minus the GTV) receiving less than 1500 cGy. The majority of patients had colorectal primary cancers. Other diagnoses included: Non-colorectal GI, b reast, ovarian, NSCLC, and others. Among the lesions treated the majority received prior chemotherapy. Results: The median overall survival was 31 months. Kaplan Meier survival estimates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 m onths were 85%, 61%, 34%, and 18%. The local control rate was 94% with Kaplan Meier estimates at 12, 2 4, 36, and 48 months being 95%, 90%, 90% and 90%. The observed toxicities noted among the 106 treatments included mostly CTC grade 1-2 toxicity with only two grade 4 and one grade 5 toxicity. There was no di fference in the toxicity based on the primary site. The majority of patients had grade 1 to 2 non-hepatic GI toxicity, grade 1-2 fatigue or grade 1-2 chest wall pain. The most severe toxicity noted was 1 patient with gr ade 5 hepatic toxicity and 2 patients with grade 4 hepatic toxicity. In addition, t wo patients developed grade 1 pleural effusions thought to be secondary to treatment. Parameters affecting toxicity were evaluated based o n grade 4-5 hepatic toxicity. Generalized estimating equation models were fit to test for an association between each categorical factor and grade 4-5 hepatic toxicity. Linear mixed mod els were used to test for an association between each continuous factor and grade 4-5 hepatic toxicity. The only patient with grade 5 toxic ity was treated three different times to a total of four lesions. Conclusion: Stereotactic body radiation ther apy is a safe and effective tr eatment for patients with 1-3 liver metastases with a limited toxicity profile.

Influencing the decision to use AART may include ill-defined patient func tional or psychological factors as well as parent/physician discretion. We analyzed our experience with AAR T for identifiable patterns reg arding age and gender in children receiving daily proton radiation therapy. Materials and Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed our records from the Indiana University Health Proton Therapy Center for patients requiring AART between January 9, 2004, and June 30, 2013, with respect to age and gender in our pediatric patients (defined as patients <18 years of age). Results: A total of 390 pediatric patients were treated in this era. Of these, 182 were girls and 208 were boys. The median age at start of treatm ent for pediatric patients treated with AART was 4 years vs. 13 years for t hose not requiring AART. Similarl y, the median age at start of treatment for pediatric boys and girls treated with AART compared to those no t requiring AART was 4 years vs. 13 years and 3 years vs. 12 years, respectively. Overall, the likelihood of requiring AART decreased with age after 3 years. All children <3 years of age, 50% of children <7-8 years of age, and 10% of children 12 years of age required AART. There was no significant difference in any age g roup by gender. Conclusion: While children aged <3 invariably require AART in our experience, not surprisi ngly, the need for AART decreases with increasing age. A small cadre of older children have functional or other issues that require them to receive AART for daily radiation treatmen t. There is no difference in A ART requirement by gender. This pattern of care data may assist centers in pre-planning needs for pediatri c radiation therapy cas es referred from distant referral sites. Additionally, it es tablishes a baseline curve f or AART requirements in t he pediatric population from which future st udies can build upon.

Data is limited regarding how long PBSC c an be cryopreserved and retain abilities to engraft. Existing data suggests that PBSC units can reconstitute p atients up to 11 years after cryopreservation, however, decreased colony forming activity has been found in PBSC units stored longer tha n 10 years. No data on transplantation of cryopreserved PBSC into immunodeficient mice has been published to date. Hypothesis: Long-term cryopreservation does not negatively impact recovery of PBSC no r ability to engraft in NOD/SCID/IL2Rnull (NSG) mice. Design: Ten discarded PBSC units were previously collected and cryopre served at our institution for clinical use. Following standard clinical thaw procedures, hematopoietic stem cell recovery was measured by the following: post-thaw cellular counts and viabil ity as compared to pre-fre eze, in vitro colony forming assays for CFU-GM and in vivo transplantation into 25 N SG mice Prior to trans plantation into mice, PBSC units were thawed, washed once with PBS buffer (phosphate- buffered saline supplemented with x 105 CD34+ transplanted. Results: PBSC Unit Characteristics: 10 PBSC units with mean of 17 years in cryopreservation (range 13.6-18.3 years). Mean donor age at time of collection was 47 y ears (range 24-66 years). PBSC Cell Recovery: mean\u00b1SD (ra nge) % Total cell recovery: 88\u00b112% (68-110%) BFU-E growth Post-thaw viability: 69\u00b117% (34-86%) CFU-GM 10 post-thaw. Mouse Engraftment Data: All mice demonstrated long-term engraftment at 12 weeks with m ean 34\u00b124% human CD45+ cells. All mice sho wed evidence of differentiation with presence of human CD19, CD3 and CD33+ cells. Harvested bone ma rrow from all mice demonstrated g rowth of erythroid and myeloid colonies. Conclusion: We demonstrated highly efficien t total cell recovery of 88% in all ten thawed PBSC units and cell viability of 62 to 86% in eight of the ten units. Most uni ts showed growth of myeloid and erythroid colonies with exception of those with lowest post-thaw viabilit y. More importantly, engraftment (both short- and long-term) was demonstrated in NSG mice with differentiatio n into multilineage phenotypes.

Epithelial tissu es, including the mammary gland of humans as well as mice, undergo extensive cell turnover, and recent studies indicate that this involves a n organized hierarchical differentiation process. To date, analysis of telomere le ngth regulation in normal mamma ry epithelial cells has been limited to reports of shorter telomeres in luminal cells in histological sections. However, the presence of telomere fusions has been noted in primary mammary epithelial cells p assaged in vitr o, and we have recently reported that telomere dysfunction-specific chromosomal fusions are common in early-st age Here we show that phenotypically separable compart ments of normal human mammary e pithelial cell subpopu lations, isolated from normal tissue samples, have markedly different telomere le ngths and telomerase activity, along with differential expression of a large set of telomere and DNA dama ge response genes. These subset-specific telomere biological alterations point to a significant change i n telomere maintenance during normal human mammary cell differentiation. Int erestingly, a subset that is h ighly enriched in luminal progenitors (LPs) is uniquely characterized by critic ally short telom eres but posses sed high telomerase. Here we study the modulation mechanism of telomerase control in LPs, which may ac t as a tumor suppressive pathway. Previous studies showed that telomerase nee ds to be associated with Caja l bodies in order to be recruited to telomere. Our preliminary data show that the telomerase in LP does not fo rm complex with Cajal bodies. In addition, the CST complex is known to bind telomeric ends to inhibit telo merase action. Our immunofluorescence data suggests that telomerase in LP cells co-localizes with the CST complex,. Thus, we are beginning to understand how telomerase is con trolled in normal LPs and how t his process may be altered during tumorgenesis.

Plasma samples from 34 patients were analyzed at days +7, +14, +21 and +30. At a media n follow-up of 358 days, 17 patients had experienced aGVHD with a median time to onset of day +36. Risk of aGVHD was associated with elevated plasma ST2 at day Plasma concentrations of TNFR1 and sIL2R were not associated w ith aGVHD risk at any of the time-points studied. This study ST2, Cy/Flu-based NMAT. These results need to be con firmed in an independent validation cohort.
