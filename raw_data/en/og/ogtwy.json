Qigong, \"the study of energy,\" is a self-healing mind-body therapy that originated in East Asia more than four thousand years ago. The purpose of Qigong is to help you improve your internal energy circulation through breathing exercises, slow body movements, and mental focus. Qigong has been researched and recommended as a modern complementary health practice for living with chronic pain, helping to relieve feelings of depression and anxiety, improving sleep quality, and many other conditions. The Body & Brain Energy Healing Qigong program is offered as a series of three courses, with five hours of study for each course. Your registration includes access to video recordings for 14 days after the live sessions. You'll get the greatest benefit if you take all three courses together. Qigong exercises are based on the tradition that our energy moves through six major channels, called meridians, connected from the head to the feet. The healthy ideal in Qigong is for our whole body to move in a fluid way, with energy flowing easily through all six meridians. After these three courses, you will circulate energy more effectively through your whole body. Here's a preview of the three sessions. You can click on the course to see more details: Sunday Nov 1, 2020 12pm-2pm, 4pm-9pm ET (9am-11am, 1pm-4pm, PST) [5 hours total] If you strengthen and activate energy circulation in the lower body, especially the hip joints and knees, you can circulate energy more effectively through the upper body. Sunday Nov 22, 2020 12pm-2pm, 4pm-9pm ET (9am-11am, 1pm-4pm, PST) [5 hours total] Our energy meridians extend from head to toe. If you open and circulate energy throughout the upper body, especially the shoulders and neck, you can improve energy circulation throughout your whole body. Sunday Dec 13, 2020 12pm-2pm, 4pm-9pm ET (9am-11am, 1pm-4pm, PST) [5 hours total] After circulating energy deeply through your whole body, including the spine and internal organs, you can develop your energy system and chakras, activating your sixth sense.
