The lymph system is part of the [immune system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It helps protect the body from [infection](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and disease. The lymph system is made up of the following: Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the [digestive tract](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bronchus](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45629&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and skin. There are two general types of [lymphomas](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Hodgkin lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270800&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults, including during [pregnancy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be [indolent](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46355&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [aggressive](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46053&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few [signs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different. This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma: Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. These and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: These signs and symptoms may be caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: When fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss occur together, this group of symptoms is called B symptoms. Other signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following: In addition to asking about your [personal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: If cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells: Other tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the following: For non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, treatment options also depend on: Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than others do. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are aggressive. Delaying treatment of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. Immediate treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy. The process used to find out the type of [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and if cancer [cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have spread within the [lymph system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of the [tests and procedures](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lymphoma/patient/adult-nhl-treatment-pdq#_150) done to [diagnose](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to help make decisions about treatment. The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging process: For [pregnant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the [fetus](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the harms of [radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used. These tests and procedures include MRI (without contrast), lumbar puncture, and [ultrasound](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer can spread through [tissue](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Stage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45906&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages I and IE. In stage I, [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in one of the following places in the [lymph system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793442&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): In stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system. [Stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45907&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages II and IIE. In stage II, the term bulky disease refers to a larger [tumor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) mass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of [lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In [stage III be described as [contiguous](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [noncontiguous](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350357&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The lymphoma may come back in the lymph system or in other parts of the body. Indolent lymphoma may come back as aggressive lymphoma. Aggressive lymphoma may come back as indolent lymphoma. Different types of treatment are available for patients with [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. For [pregnant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the [fetus](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment decisions are based on the mother's wishes, the [stage](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the trimester of the pregnancy. The treatment plan may change as the [signs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Treatment will be overseen by a [medical oncologist](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46290&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a [hematologist](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46370&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating [blood cancers](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=733834&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The medical oncologist may refer you to other [health care providers](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who have experience and are experts in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of [medicine](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These may include the following [specialists](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): For information about [side effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begin during treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called [late effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment with for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following: Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular [follow-up](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for late effects is important. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Sometimes [total-body irradiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is given before a [stem cell transplant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Proton beam radiation therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of [protons](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44715&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill [tumor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy [tissue](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near a tumor such as the heart or [breast](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). External radiation therapy is used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as [palliative therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to relieve symptoms and improve [quality of life](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For a pregnant woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If treatment is needed right away, the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. A [lead shield](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798602&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to cover the pregnant woman's [abdomen](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed ( [intrathecal chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46681&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), an [organ](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ( [regional chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs. [Steroid drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46601&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be added, to lessen [inflammation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and lower the body's [immune response](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Systemic combination chemotherapy is used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of [lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that first forms in the [testicles](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [sinuses](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (hollow areas) around is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and [spinal cord](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is called [CNS prophylaxis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46472&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the fetus cannot be protected from being exposed to chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester. For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/non-hodgkin). [Immunotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's [immune system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/non-hodgkin). Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Monoclonal antibody](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [proteasome inhibitor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=393541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy, and [kinase inhibitor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750798&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy types of targeted therapy used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Types of monoclonal antibodies include: For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/non-hodgkin). If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects [circulation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [plasmapheresis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is done to remove extra [plasma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with [donated](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming. [Watchful waiting](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45942&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely [monitoring](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) a patient's [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. [Antibiotic](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat [infections](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cancer caused by [bacteria](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [microorganisms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44059&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Surgery](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with [indolent](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [aggressive](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body: Patients who have a heart, [lung](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [kidney](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [pancreas](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [transplant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term [immunosuppression](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45727&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) needed to [diagnose](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [celiac disease](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma. Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high [doses](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the ( [allogeneic transplant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270732&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). [Vaccine therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386223&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the [tumor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and kill it. For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has changed or if the cancer has [recurred](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back). These tests are sometimes called [follow-up](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests or check-ups.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).
