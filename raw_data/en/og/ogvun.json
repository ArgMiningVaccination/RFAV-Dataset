Also effective on heavy legs, sleep disorders, stress, back pain, muscle tension and lack of energy. Supplied with a carry bag 100% organic textiles: organic cotton and coconut fiber A method recognized and trusted by thousands of users Organic cotton, hypoallergenic plastic The Climsom Zen acupressure and magnetotherapy mat is the first acupressure mat to offer magnetotherapy targeted at back pain. It combines 6930 micro acupressure points and 42 strategically placed magnets. The Climsom Zen acupressure and magnetotherapy mat includes 210 discs with 33 acupressure spikes, making a total of 6930 points. This number of spikes, their shape and the spacing between the discs form a harmonious whole that is more important than the numbers themselves. It is indeed important to have neither too few nor too many spikes. Too few spikes will make the experience painful, while too many spikes will make it less effective because each individual spike will exert less pressure, which is necessary for acupressure to be effective. Relieve your pain, release your tension, eliminate stress! The acupressure and magnetotherapy mat is composed of thousands of acupressure spikes, it will stimulate all the areas in contact with the acupressure points. This stimulation acts on nervous and muscular tensions. By releasing endorphins and oxytocin, produced naturally by our body, it provides almost immediate relief from tension, pain and inflammation. Acupressure will also boost blood circulation. It is the blood that allows the transport of essential nutrients and oxygen to our cells. It is also through it that we eliminate toxins. Thanks to this new blood flow, you will be able to have a positive impact on your back pains, heavy legs, muscle pain and stress.

It is made of high quality, fully organic materials, non-allergenic, non-recycled plastic micro-spikes that ensure comfort and durability. The cover is made of 100% organic cotton and the mat is made of 100% organic coconut fibre, a healthy, hypoallergenic and anti-mite material that lasts for many years. Magnethotherapy The power of a single magnet on the Climsom Zen acupressure mat is 400 Gauss. The positioning of the magnets - close to the body and in contact with the skin - and this quantity give them an optimal field of action by acting directly on the pain. The Climsom Zen magnetic acupressure mat is composed of 42 magnets placed in a \"T\" shape. This \"T\" positioning has been specially designed to target the areas of pain of the majority of patients, namely : - A vertical line that runs along the spine. - A horizontal line which is, when the mat is placed \"T\" downwards, positioned at the lumbar region. - A horizontal line which is, when the mat is placed \"T\" upwards, positioned at the level of the trapezius and cervical vertebrae. Thanks to the special shape of the Climsom Zen magnetic acupressure mat, the magnets act on the main painful areas of the back. Depending on the problems and pains encountered, you can then position your acupressure mat in one direction or the other. The use of magnets for therapeutic purposes, or magnetotherapy, dates back to ancient times. Today, magnets are still used to treat a wide variety of health problems. They are mainly used to relieve pain associated with chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetic neuropathy and back pain, and to help healing, for example after surgery. Magnets are also used to combat stress-related symptoms such as migraine and insomnia. By improving the exchanges and the resourcing of the cells, magnetotherapy allows a natural magnetic rebalancing which favours: - relaxation - sleep - circulatory rhythms - bloog circulation - pain relief USE Lie down on the acupressure mat, in a 15 to 20 minutes session, everyday or whenever you feel the need.
