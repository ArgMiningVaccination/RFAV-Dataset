Many lifestyle choices and environmental factors can impact the immune system, including stress and diet. The New York Center for Integrative Health can help you understand how to support your immune system to keep you healthier. What are the Signs of an Unhealthy Immune System? When your immune system is not functioning properly, neither are you. You may have: - Fatigue - Difficulty handling stress - Frequent indigestion - Lots of sick days - Frequent allergies and infections - Slow wound healing - Aches and pains How Do You Support the Immune System? The immune system is a complex network of cells, hormones, proteins, and symbiotic microbes in your body that work together to fight off known invaders and adapt to new ones. As you age, your body's immune system can begin to weaken, and certain medications like antibiotics can speed up the process. Our practice can perform blood screening to check for low levels of hormones, vitamins, or other nutrients that your immune system needs to function properly. We can also check for elevated levels of blood proteins that indicate inflammation and screen your microbiome to look for signs of imbalance. Once we have a clear picture of your health, we can recommend diet and lifestyle changes, customized IV therapies, and botanical formulas to boost your immune system and put things back into harmony. You know your body best. If something does not feel right, we are here to help.

Contact our office today to set up an appointment. Dr. Robert Kachko with an introduction to the immune system and its importance How important is our immune system? Hi, this is Robert Kachko from New York and Stamford Centers for Integrative Health. I want to spend some time today discussing with you the role of the immune system and long-term sustainable health. Our immune system is deeply connected to every other system in our body, including our nervous, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. Much of our immune system response begins in our gut. That's where our immune system learns how to deal with the outside world appropriately. What are the health issues related to the immune system? An immune system that can be over or underactive can cause many symptoms. For example, an overactive immune system can cause autoimmune diseases like joint pain, lupus, or allergies. This includes reactions to any food that we eat or environmental substances we're exposed to. In the same way, an underactive immune system can lead to frequent colds, infections that won't resolve, and sometimes even cancer. We need our immune system to help us prevent these types of long-term chronic issues. What are the treatments available? At our clinic, we take a thorough, comprehensive approach which almost always begins with testing. There are blood work and functional medicine tests that we can do to assess the factors like immune deficiencies, nutrient deficiencies, inflammatory and oxidative cascades, and overactivity of the immune system, including things like autoimmune disease checks. During your thorough whole health assessment, we take a very careful history to understand whether your immune system may play a role in your long-term health. Then one of our clinicians will personally recommend a nutrition plan, high-dose nutrients, botanical medicines, IV therapies, and many other treatments like mind-body medicine techniques, acupuncture, physical medicine, and exercise. Our goal is to help you achieve long-term sustainable well-being, and in supporting your immune system, you'll be that much closer to doing so on your journey toward optimal health. Make an appointment with us today to make your immune system strong.
