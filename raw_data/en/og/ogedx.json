Introduction Monkeypox virus (MPV) is an family Poxviridae.1 The MPV genome is 96.3% identical to smallpox, which is a variola virus that is now eradicated.2 Human monkeypox was first identified in 1970 in a 9-month-old baby.3 Outbreaks continued but were predominantly contained within Africa.4 In May 2022, multiple cases of MPV were seen in nonendemic countries. As of September 22, 2022, there had been more than 24,500 confirmed MPV cases in the U.S.5 This is the largest outbreak seen outside of Africa.6 On August 4, 2022, President Biden declared the MPV outbreak a public health emergency.7 The current 2022 MPV variant (Clade IIb) appears to have 40 mutations from the closest MPV variant.4 The current variant spreads most commonly in men who have sex with men. Transmission is through contact with skin lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets from an infected individual. The incubation period is 3 to 17 days and illness can last 2 to 4 weeks, which affords ample time for individuals to unknowingly spread the virus to others and further the outbreak.8 Vaccine Recommendations The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released interim guidance for both nonpharmacologic (ie, avoiding contact with bodily fluids of potentially infected persons, including respiratory secretions) and pharmacologic monkeypox prevention strategies.9 Currently the CDC recommends monkeypox vaccination in specific populations rather than a mass vaccination strategy. The current recommendations include pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in people whose jobs may expose them to monkeypox, such as those who perform diagnostic testing, research laboratory workers, or healthcare workers designated by public health authorities.10 Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for individuals who have had known contact with infected individuals or presumed contact.11 Presumed contact includes individuals with a known sexual partner in the past 14 days with MPV or who have had multiple sexual partners in the past 14 days in a geographic area with known MPV. The monkeypox vaccine is recommended to be administered within 4 days of exposure and may have diminished effect if given between 4 and 14 days after exposure. Vaccination after the onset of signs or symptoms of monkeypox is likely not beneficial. Vaccines There are currently 2 MPV vaccines available in the United States. Jynneos (known as Imvamune or Imvamax outside of the United States) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine for both smallpox and monkeypox.12 It is a live, non-replicating, modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine. Jynneos is approved as a 2-dose series (each 0.5 mL subcutaneously) with doses separated by 4 weeks.11 Due to a limited supply of the vaccine, a modified vaccination strategy of 2 x 107 TCID50 MVA-BN 0.1 mL intradermally (2 doses given 4 weeks apart) can be used under an Emergency Use Authorization.13 Jynneos must be stored in a freezer between -25 and -15 degrees Celsius or refrigerated between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius.14 Once Jynneos is thawed and stored in the refrigerator, it must be used within 8 weeks. One of the challenges with using the intradermal route to increase vaccine supply is the stability of the vial once it is punctured (store in refrigerator and discard after 8 hours). This presents the issue of scheduling an adequate number of individuals within the appropriate time frame to prevent vaccine waste. Scarring after intradermal vaccine administration is possible; therefore, individuals with a history of keloid scars are recommended to receive the vaccine subcutaneously. ACAM2000 is a live smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine that is available off-label for MPV vaccination under an Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol.15 Vaccinia viruses have more adverse reactions and contraindications than MVA-BN vaccines since they are live and replicating. ACAM2000 is administered via percutaneous vaccination with a bifurcation needle depositing 1 droplet of vaccine on the skin followed by 15 jabs with the needle through the droplet within a diameter of about 5 mm (scarification).16 The vaccine is stored frozen until ready for use. After reconstitution, it must be used within 6 to 8 hours if kept at room temperature. Unused, reconstituted vaccine may be stored in a refrigerator for up to 20 days. Throughout the history of smallpox vaccination, preference has shifted from the live vaccinia vaccine to MVA vaccine, largely due to safety concerns. Special populations such as those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have 3 or more major cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, or a first-degree family member with heart disease before age 50 years), have atopic dermatitis, eczema, or other exfoliative skin condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any other congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (including from medications), or have a prior history of MPV should not receive ACAM2000.17 Literature review There is no data available on clinical efficacy of Jynneos and ACAM2000 in preventing MPV infection or disease, either in the past or in the current outbreak. Jynneos was originally approved for smallpox based on immunogenicity compared to the prior smallpox vaccine ACAM2000.16,18 The Table summarizes the available immunogenicity studies for MVA-BN vaccines, which are all limited to evidence of smallpox antibody production. This table only includes MVA-BN vaccines since most vaccines given in the U.S. during the current MVP outbreak will likely be the MVA-BN formulation. |Table.

Summary MVA-BN vaccines have shown effective smallpox seroconversion and relative safety in healthy individuals and special populations, including those with HIV, undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and with atopic dermatitis.18-28 Limited data with intradermal MVA-BN administration shows similar and safety compared to subcutaneous and intramuscular administration.24,29 Cutaneous reactions are more common with intradermal administration than with subcutaneous or intramuscular, but overall, there is no increase in serious reactions. Conclusion The current MPV outbreak in the U.S. is facing limited vaccine supply and vaccination challenges, including storage and stability requirements, patient-reported vaccine eligibility, and ensuring compliance with a multiple vaccine series. No clinical studies have demonstrated that vaccination decreases MPV infection, but immunogenicity studies suggest that MVA-BN vaccines are relatively safe and lead to smallpox seroconversion that may prevent MPV infection in humans; further data showing that vaccines decrease MPV infection are needed. Individuals who received the MVA-BN vaccine in immunogenicity studies are similar to the higher risk individuals who should receive Jynneos rather than ACAM2000. Populations not studied include pregnant and lactating individuals, and those with cardiac risk factors, eczema, or congenital or other acquired immunodeficiencies. First-generation vaccines such as ACAM2000 have more safety concerns than the MVA-BN vaccines, particularly adverse cardiac events.16 Although intradermal administration of Jynneos is allowed, this may result in more local adverse events than subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. Further study of the efficacy and safety of intradermal Jynneos administration is underway.30 References - Monkeypox. World Health Organization website. May 19, 2022.
