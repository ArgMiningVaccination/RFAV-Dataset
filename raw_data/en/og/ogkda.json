I went for in person training for Shamanic energy practitioner. I had 3 days of in person training. My time with my teachers Alex and Kathy was amazing. They are truly amazing and knowledgeable ladies who know are content experts! Their home office is beautiful and my training included snacks and lunch which was healthy and delicious! I am confident in the content I was taught. I am excited to be a Shaman, I learned so much! In 2019 I took singing bowl practitioner training and Kathy was an amazing teacher for this as well. Highly recommend their services.Jocielyn W. We don't even know where to begin. My husband and I took the Shamanic Energy Healing course with both Katherine and Alex and we were, are, blown away by these two goddesses. Aside from being gentle hearted, incredibly welcoming and patient- they are powerful, knowledgeable and AUTHENTIC Shamans. They are so in-tuned with the spirituality of healing, the entire experience was not only educational but empowering and healing in its own capacity. We left after 4 full days of intense immersion as new humans. I highly recommend taking their services and their courses. If we could offer more than 5 stars - we would.Tim and Sue-Jolie I recently completed my Shamanic Energy Practitioner Certification with these beautiful souls, and I could not have asked for a more loving, nurturing, and supportive experience. I learned so much and really appreciated their 1:1 offering of this program so that I could learn and heal at my own pace, and in the way it needed to happen for me. I can't recommend Mausouleum (Kathy and Alex) enough!Angela G. I can't say enough wonderful and inspiring things about Kathy. I just finished her Usui Reiki Master & Singing Bowl Sound Healing Practitioner Certifications class and it was the best experience and life changing. I fell in love with her bowls and gongs! I highly recommended her program as she teaches you at your own pace and the atmosphere was so peaceful and light. Kathy created a safe and calming space that was perfect to learn in. She is a highly experienced and gifted Reiki Master and a very knowledgeable instructor. Kathy helps you to trusts your own instincts and tap into your inner wisdom and be able to guide yourself throughout your spiritual journey with your own intuition. I have learned so much from her.
