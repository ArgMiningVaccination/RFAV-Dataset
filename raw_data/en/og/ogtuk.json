We are heading into winter during a global pandemic, so let's talk about what it means to have a \"healthy lifestyle.\" I want to help you understand what specific nutrients will protect you the most in these upcoming months. Our best advice? \"Eat the Rainbow.\" This idea is one of the most important steps in our [10-Step Guide to Clean Eating](https://girlswhoeat.com/subscribe/). But let's dive deeper. This blog post will give you 30 different foods that boost immunity and promote all types of physical health this winter. Get your grocery lists ready! These vitamins and minerals help to strengthen the immune system and keep it functioning all winter long. What foods should we be eating? Which foods will give you a full daily value of Vitamin C? What foods are high in antioxidants? They're all on this list! Keep reading for a list of foods high in: - Vitamin C - Zinc - Beta Carotene and Vitamin A - Vitamin E - Anti-Inflammatory properties - Antioxidants Let's get started! Best Sources of Vitamin C Vitamin C is commonly known for its ability to help protect against colds by increasing the production of white blood cells (white blood cells are key to fighting infections). Unlike other nutrients, Vitamin C is not stored in the body, so you need between 65-90mg each day. Add these foods to your shopping list for a daily dose of Vitamin C! 1. Citrus Fruits Choose your favorite: oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, or tangerines. 2. Red Peppers Did you know red peppers have almost 3x the amount of Vitamin C as oranges? They are also a rich source of Beta Carotene, which converts into Vitamin A (see below). One cup of chopped red bell pepper has more than double your daily recommended intake of Vitamin C. Want to get the most Vitamin C out of your peppers? Eat them raw. Prefer to cook them? I highly recommend my [stuffed peppers](https://girlswhoeat.com/mexican-style-stuffed-peppers/)! 3. Kiwi One kiwi gives you way more than the recommended daily dose of Vitamin C. Eat them with granola or add them to an oat bowl for a delicious breakfast! 4. Tomatoes Add tomatoes into dishes easily with some of my favorite recipes, including my [chickpea tajine](https://girlswhoeat.com/vegan-chickpea-and-vegetable-tajine/) and [ this greek style spaghetti squash](https://girlswhoeat.com/greek-style-spaghetti-squash/)! 5. Sweet Potatoes Like red peppers, sweet potatoes are high in Vitamin C and contain Beta Carotene. You get more bang for your buck when you add them to your favorite meal! I love to make sweet potato fries or add chunks of sweet potato into salads or grain bowls. 6. Broccoli My favorite way to eat broccoli is roasted or saut\u00e9ed with some oil and herbs! 7. Leafy Greens Spinach and kale are high in Vitamin C, and best if eaten raw, but listen to your body! If raw leafy greens don't agree with your stomach, try a different method. I love making salads with spinach or [ air fryer kale chips](https://girlswhoeat.com/cheesy-kale-chips/)! 8. Strawberries Strawberries are great plain, but I also love to put them on top of a warm oat bowl! Best Sources of Zinc Research shows that Zinc can reduce common cold symptoms. Like Vitamin C, Zinc helps create and activate white blood cells involved in the body's immune response. Our body does not store or produce Zinc so it's important to have 8-15mg each day. The following foods are some of the best sources of Zinc in your daily diet. 9. Shellfish Oysters, crab, lobster, and mussels are all fantastic sources of Zinc! 10. Oatmeal Shellfish isn't the greatest breakfast food, but oatmeal is! Enjoy some overnight oats or my [breakfast cookies](https://girlswhoeat.com/oat-banana-cookies/) to get your daily dose of Zinc early. 11. Seeds and Nuts Take your pick from hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, cashews, or peanuts! Seeds are great as a salad topper or in trail mix. I also love to eat nuts in nut butter form. 12. Beans and Lentils You can match your beans to your outfit! Choose chickpeas, white beans, black beans, or lentils (which come in many colors.) Add them to [pasta dishes](https://girlswhoeat.com/spaghetti-squash-with-lentil-bolognese/), make tacos, or try my favorite [bean salad](https://girlswhoeat.com/vegetable-bean-salad-with-lemon-dressing/)! 13. Mushrooms Eat mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with some oil and herbs, or add to a dish like [tahini mushroom chickpea pasta!](https://girlswhoeat.com/tahini-mushroom-chickpea-pasta/) Best Sources of Beta Carotene & Vitamin A Beta Carotene converts into Vitamin A, an anti-inflammatory vitamin that can help your antibodies respond to toxins (\"toxins\" include viruses and viral infections). Vitamin A dissolves in fat (also known as a \"fat-soluble vitamin,\") so consuming the following foods with healthy fats (i.e. oils, nuts, or an avocado) will aid absorption (think carrots with traditional hummus, or a spinach salad with avocado). 14. Orange Fruits and Vegetables Carrots, butternut squash, and sweet potatoes are great sources of Vitamin A! Eat the rainbow! 15. Leafy Greens Try spinach, kale, collards, swiss chard, or bok choy. Saut\u00e9 these or sneak your greens into quick-and-easy [pancakes](https://girlswhoeat.com/spinach-oat-pancakes/). They also make a great base for a salad! Best Sources of Vitamin E Vitamin E is another important nutrient that promotes immune system functioning, prevents colds, and helps to regulate the immune system. Vitamin E is also a fat-soluble vitamin - enjoy these foods with the healthy fat of your choice! 16. Sunflower seeds Eat them raw or add to a salad for crunch! 17. Almonds Raw almonds are a great snack, but this nut is more than meets the eye. Use almond flour in your baking (like I did with this [gluten free lava cake](https://girlswhoeat.com/gluten-free-chocolate-lava-cake/)), or slather almond butter on your morning toast! Delish! 18. Avocados This healthy fat is easy to absorb. Eat them raw, add it on to toast, make guacamole, or try our [ avocado crema](https://girlswhoeat.com/corn-zucchini-fritters-with-avocado-crema/). The possibilities are endless. Anti-Inflammatory Foods Anti-inflammatory foods are really important to have in your kitchen. Inflammation is the root cause of any disease and can wreak havoc on your body's ability to fight off cold and flu. Foods that reduce or help with inflammation improves your body's immune fighting response. 19. Turmeric Turmeric contains a powerful anti-inflammatory chemical called curcumin. According to a study published in the [Journal of Clinical Immunology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211725/), curcumin activates the production of T-cells, which are the main cells fighting for your health in your immune system. 20. Ginger Starting to sniffle? Ginger helps to fight colds and flu. Add it into your food for some flavor, sip on ginger water, or make ginger tea with honey and turmeric. More Sources of Antioxidants Antioxidants, including Vitamin C and Vitamin E, fight against [free radicals](https://www.livescience.com/54901-free-radicals.html). Free radicals, in excessive amounts, can cause serious damage to your body. They are linked to multiple illnesses, including diabetes and heart disease. Your body has its own defense system against free radicals, but you can also find antioxidants in food to help your body out in the fight. 21. Elderberry Did you know elderberries are loaded with antioxidants? Not many people do! You can [make elderberry syrup at home to save money](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/elderberry-syrup-recipe) or buy syrups like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036THLPE/?ref=exp_girlswhoeat_dp_vv_d) to take daily during the winter. 22. Green Tea or Matcha Powder Research shows that green tea is packed with antioxidants that enhance immune system functioning. Green tea can be consumed hot or cold - take your pick! Alternatively, you can enjoy matcha powder, which is green tea in powder form. My favorite [tea](https://www.matchaful.com/collections/single-origin/products/single-origin-kiwami-tin-30g) is high-quality, ceremonial-grade matcha from Matchaful. I use it to make matcha lattes! 23. Blueberries These fruits are filled with antioxidants that can help treat and prevent coughs and colds. 24. Dark Chocolate This delicious treat contains theobromine, an antioxidant that reduces coughing! 25. Rosemary Add this onto roasted veggies for some extra antioxidants! 26. Apples Enjoy plain, with a nut butter, or saut\u00e9ed with some ghee and cinnamon! 27. Pomegranates These fruits are high in antioxidants and are a great source of Vitamins C and E! I love to top dishes like my [ tri-color roasted carrots](https://girlswhoeat.com/tri-color-roasted-carrots-with-tahini-pomegranate-and-pistachio/) with them. Other Food Warriors That Boost Immunity 28. Garlic Garlic contains compounds that stimulate disease-fighting cells and help regulate the immune system. A clove or two in your meal can boost the production of virus-fighting T-cells and can reduce the amount of stress hormones your body produces. Less stress gives your immune system less to do! Garlic also gives white blood cells a boost and helps fight colds. I add garlic on top of any vegetables before I roast them, especially [potatoes](https://girlswhoeat.com/garlic-smashed-potatoes/)! 29. Probiotics Gut health is closely linked to our immune system. A healthy gut is crucial for fighting off disease. Promote gut health by finding probiotics in fermented foods: miso, kimchi, kombucha, yogurt, etc. 30. Raw Honey This type of honey is an antibacterial that can kill germs that could make you get sick. I love adding honey to tea, on top of a nut butter toast, or in baked goods.I live by the saying, \"food is medicine.\" I truly believe that food can help fight off diseases, viruses, and help improve our health drastically. There is also a tremendous amount of evidence that food is directly linked to our health. Eating a cleaner diet has personally helped my body feel better and fight off infections faster. The foods I've listed are just some of many options for boosting your immune system, especially during the pandemic and in winter months. Where should you start? Try and eat more fruits and vegetables that have the nutrients and antioxidants to strengthen your immune system. A strong immune system can fight against illness and stress faster. Start small! Add one leafy green to your dinner or one cup of strawberries to your daily diet. These changes can have a lasting impact. Other ideas of small changes you can make to your diet include: - Adding garlic to sauteed vegetables - Swapping out your milk chocolate for dark chocolate - Adding in some oats to your breakfast bowl Challenge yourself to eat as many nutrients as you can, as often as possible!
