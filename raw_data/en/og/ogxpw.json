At first, people have digestive problems, feel thirsty, and may urinate a lot, but if severe, hypercalcemia leads to confusion and eventually coma. If not recognized and treated, the disorder can be life threatening. Usually, hypercalcemia is detected by routine blood tests. Drinking lots of fluids may be sufficient, but diuretics may increase calcium excretion, and drugs can be used to slow the release of calcium from bone if needed.

Causes of Hypercalcemia Causes of hypercalcemia include the following: Hyperparathyroidism: One or more of the four parathyroid glands secrete too much parathyroid hormone, which helps control the amount of calcium in blood. Too much calcium intake: Occasionally, hypercalcemia develops in people with [peptic ulcers](/en-pr/home/digestive-disorders/gastritis-and-peptic-ulcer-disease/peptic-ulcer-disease) [Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.

The resulting disorder is called the milk-alkali syndrome. Too much vitamin D intake: If people take very high daily doses of vitamin D over several months, the amount of calcium absorbed from the digestive tract increases substantially. Cancer: Cells in kidney, lung, and ovary cancers may secrete large amounts of a protein that, like parathyroid hormone, increases the calcium level in blood. These effects, called humoral hypercalcemia of cancer, are considered a [paraneoplastic syndrome](/en-pr/home/cancer/overview-of-cancer/paraneoplastic-syndromes) [Paraneoplastic Paraneoplastic (associated with cancer\u2014see also Overview of Cancer) syndromes occur when a cancer causes unusual symptoms due to substances that circulate in the bloodstream. These substances... read more](/en-pr/home/cancer/overview-of-cancer/paraneoplastic-syndromes). Calcium can also be released into the blood when cancer spreads (metastasizes) to bone and destroys bone cells. Such bone destruction occurs most commonly with prostate, breast, and lung cancers. [Multiple myeloma](/en-pr/home/blood-disorders/plasma-cell-disorders/multiple-myeloma) [Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in which abnormal plasma cells multiply uncontrollably in the bone marrow and occasionally in other parts of the body. People often have bone pain... read more](/en-pr/home/blood-disorders/plasma-cell-disorders/multiple-myeloma)(a cancer involving bone marrow) can also lead to the destruction of bone and result in hypercalcemia. Other cancers can increase the calcium level in blood by means not yet fully understood. Bone disorders: If bone is broken down (resorbed) or destroyed, calcium is released into the blood, sometimes causing hypercalcemia. In [Paget disease](/en-pr/home/bone,-joint,-and-muscle-disorders/paget-disease-of-bone/paget-disease-of-bone) [Paget Disease of Bone Paget disease of bone is a chronic disorder of the skeleton in which areas of bone undergo abnormal turnover, resulting in areas of enlarged and softened bone.

Inactivity: Rarely, people who are immobilized, such as those who are paralyzed, or people who must remain in bed for a long time, develop hypercalcemia because calcium in bone is released into the blood when bones do not bear weight for long periods of time. Granulomatous disorders, drugs, endocrine disorders, and some other disorders may also cause hypercalcemia. Did You Know... Hyperparathyroidism (See also [Hyperparathyroidism](/en-pr/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/parathyroid-disorders/hyperparathyroidism) [ Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism occurs when overactive parathyroid glands cause levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood to become elevated. An elevated PTH level then leads to a high level of calcium... read more ](/en-pr/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/parathyroid-disorders/hyperparathyroidism) .) The parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, which Increases the absorption of calcium from the digestive tract Causes the kidneys to excrete less calcium Causes bones to release stored calcium Parathyroid hormone causes the kidneys to excrete more phosphate, but it also causes the bones to release phosphate into the blood. The balance between these two effects determines whether the phosphate level remains normal or decreases. If the parathyroid glands release too much parathyroid hormone, hyperparathyroidism results. People with hyperparathyroidism have too much calcium and a normal or low level of phosphate in their blood. Primary hyperparathyroidism In primary hyperparathyroidism, an abnormality causes the release of too much parathyroid hormone. In about 90% of people with primary hyperparathyroidism, the abnormality is a noncancerous tumor (adenoma) in one of the parathyroid glands. In the remaining 10%, the glands simply enlarge and produce too much hormone. Rarely, cancers of the parathyroid glands cause hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common among women than among men. It is more likely to develop in older people and in people who have received radiation therapy to the neck. Sometimes it occurs as part of the syndrome of [multiple endocrine neoplasia](/en-pr/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-syndromes) [ Multiple Endocrine rare hereditary disorder. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually treated by surgically removing one or more of the parathyroid glands. The goal is to remove all parathyroid tissue that is producing excess hormone. Surgery is successful in almost 90% of cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism In secondary hyperparathyroidism, excess parathyroid hormone is released in response to a large decrease in the calcium level in blood, as can occur in [chronic kidney disease](/en-pr/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/kidney-failure/chronic-kidney-disease) [ Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys' ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood.

Treatment depends on the cause. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, excess parathyroid hormone is released regardless of the amount of calcium in the blood. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually occurs in people who have had long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment depends on the cause. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia The syndrome of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a hereditary disorder that results from the parathyroid glands underestimating the amount of calcium in the blood and, in response, mistakenly secreting too much parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid surgery is not useful in this disorder, and other treatment is usually not needed. Symptoms of Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia often causes few symptoms. The earliest symptoms of hypercalcemia are usually constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. People may excrete abnormally large amounts of urine, resulting in dehydration and increased thirst. Very severe hypercalcemia often causes brain dysfunction with confusion, emotional disturbances, delirium, hallucinations, and coma. Muscle weakness may occur, and [abnormal heart rhythms](/en-pr/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/abnormal-heart-rhythms/overview-of-abnormal-heart-rhythms) [ Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart.

Less commonly, kidney failure develops, but it usually resolves with treatment. However, if enough calcium accumulates within the kidneys, damage is irreversible. Diagnosis of Hypercalcemia Measurement of calcium level in the blood Hypercalcemia is usually detected during routine blood tests. Once hypercalcemia is detected, additional testing may be needed to determine the cause. Additional blood tests and urine tests may be done. A chest x-ray may also be needed to look for cancer or a lung disorder that can cause hypercalcemia. Genetic testing may be done when doctors are looking for a hereditary cause. Treatment of Hypercalcemia Fluids and drugs to increase excretion of calcium When hypercalcemia is not severe, correcting the cause is often sufficient. If people have mild hypercalcemia or conditions that can cause hypercalcemia and if their kidney function is normal, they are usually advised to drink plenty of fluids. Fluids stimulate the kidneys to excrete calcium and help prevent dehydration. Doctors may advise people to take mineral supplements containing phosphate, which helps prevent calcium absorption. If the calcium level is very high or if symptoms of brain dysfunction or muscle weakness appear, fluids and diuretics are given by vein (intravenously) as long as kidney function is normal. [Dialysis](/en-pr/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/dialysis/dialysis) [ Dialysis Dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly.

Several other drugs (including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, corticosteroids, and, rarely, plicamycin) can be used to treat hypercalcemia. These drugs work primarily by slowing the release of calcium from bone. Hypercalcemia caused by cancer is particularly difficult to treat. Sometimes a drug called denosumab is helpful. If the cancer cannot be controlled, hypercalcemia usually returns despite the best treatment.
