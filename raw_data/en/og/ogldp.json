These features distinguish them from foot orthotics, which are shoe inserts that do not extend above the ankle. CUSTOM FABRICATED ORTHOSIS A Ccustom fabricated orthosis is one which is individually made for a specific patient starting with basic materials including, but not limited to, plastic, metal, leather, o r cloth in the form of sheets, p arts, etc. It involves substa ntial work such as cutting, bending, molding, sewing, etc. It may involve the incorporation of some prefabricated components. It involves more than trimming, bending, or making other modifications to a substantially prefabricated item. DISPOSABLE MEDICAL SUPPLIES Disposable medical supplies are those items which are not reusable, and are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose, and generally are not useful to a person in the absence of an illness or injury. DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME) DME is defined as equipment which can withstand repeated use, and is primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose, and generally is not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury and is appropriate for use in the home. DUR ABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT MEDICARE ADMI NISTRATIVE CONTRACTOR (DME MAC) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) utilize four insurance companies to process durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and disposable medical supply claims for Medicare in four distinct jurisdictions. Nevada is in Jurisdiction D. This was formerly referred to as Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier (DMERC). DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, PROSTHETICS, ORTHOTICS, AND SUPPLIES (DMEPOS) Aggregate term used under the Medicare program and by some Medicaid programs, which incorporates all durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and disposable medical supplies. The acronym is pronounced \"demipose\". DRAFT MTL 27/15 CL DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1302 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: DEFINITIONS October 1, 2015 DME, DISPOSABLE SUPPLIES AND SUPPLEMENTS Section 1302 Page 2 MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION For the purposes of obtaining DMEPOS through Nevada Medicaid and Nevada Check Up (NCU), medical documentation used to support medical necessity is part of a medical record which is completed, signed and dated by a licensed medical professional. Clinical reports or assessm ents required to support medical necessity must be from a licensed/certified professional performing within their scope of practice. Information used as medical documentation cannot be compiled or composed by the recipient, their relatives or representatives. MISUSE To use in a manner in which an item is not intended, excessive use, or to use incorrectly. MOLDED TO PATIENT MODEL ORTHOSIS A molded- to-patient -model orthosis is a particular type of custom fabricated orthosis in which an impression of the specific body part is made (by means of a plaster cast, CAD -CAM technology, etc.) and this impression is then used to make a positive model (of plaster or other material) of the body part. The orthosis is then molded on this positive model. ORTHOSIS An o rthosis (brace) is a rigid or semi- rigid device which is used for the purpose of supporting a weak or deformed body member or restricting or eliminating motion in a diseased or injured part of the body. An orthosis can be either prefabricated or custom -fabricated. PREFABRICATED ORTHOSIS A Ppre-fabricated orthosis is one which is manufactured in quantity without a specific patient in mind. A prefabricated orthosis may be trimmed, bent, molded (with or without heat), or otherwise modified for use by a speci fic patient (i.e., custom fitted). An orthosis that is assembled from prefabricated components is considered prefabricated. Any o rthosis that does not meet the d efinition of a custom -fabricated orthosis is considered prefabricated. PROSTHETIC DEVICES Prosthetic devices are replacement, corrective, or supportive devices prescribed by a physician (or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts within the scope of his practice as defined by state law) to : a. Artificially replace a missing portion of the bo dy; b.

RENTAL 1. In addition to all other requirements and qualifications for specific products, if the DMEPOS Fee Schedule allows a rental option, a device may be rented when: a. the anticipated length of need (per physician's/practitioner's order) is short term (six months or less) and renta l would be more cost effective than purchase; b. a temporary trial period is required for the item according to Medicaid's policy; c. the item is only available as a rental per the DMEPOS Fee Schedule; or d. a temporary rental is needed while a recipient -owned like item is being repaired. 2. During a rental period, rental rates include all supplies and accessories necessary to render the equipment useable and safe, delivery and set up services, education and training for recipient and family, routine maintenance a nd servicing (such as testing, cleaning, regulating and checking equipment), repairs, non- routine maintenance and servicing (such as breaking down sealed components and performing tests which require specialized equipment and skills of a technician), and r eplacement of items. These services are the responsibility of the owner, the DMEPOS supplier. 3.

The DMEPOS supplier must contact the r ecipient or their representative within five business days prior to each billing cycle to verify the rented item is still medically necessary, in working condition, and being used by the recipient (contact does not include system generated correspondence) . Verification must be documented and maintained in the DMEPOS supplier's records and be accessible for audits. 4. Rent -to-Purchase Option: a. The DHCFP allows rental of certain DMEPOS items up to the provider's Usual and Customary Charge (UCC) for purchase, or the maximum Medicaid allowable purchase price of the item .; whichever is less. b. Only certain equipment, as specifically defined by Medicaid, wil l be rental only.Unless the item is identified by Nevada Medicaid as a rental only, DRAFT MTL 27/15 CL DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1303 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY October 1, 2015 DME, DISPOSABLE SUPPLIES AND SUPPLEMENTS Section 1303 Page 10 oOnce the total cumulative rental payments have reached the lower of UCC or maximum Medicaid allowable purchase rate, then the item is considered purchased in full and recipient -owned. c. The provider shall automatically transfer the title for the equipment to the recipient. Providers are not to submit prior authorizations to transfer titles . Providers are also not to submit prior authorizations coded as a purchase after the lower of UCC or Medicaid allowable purchase rate is reached. No rental or purchase payments will be made for the remaining reasonable useful lifetime of the device (usually not less than five years (60 months) ). The provider's records must include the date the title was t ransferred to the recipient. d. When an item was new at the time of issuance, and it is later determined the recipient will need the item long term, rental payments will be applied toward the total purchase rate ( either the provider's UCC or the Medicaid allowable or if no Medicaid rate exists, the manufacturer's invoice of cost ). Refer to \"Purchase Used Equipment Option\" in Section 1303. e. Equipment that was not new at the time of issuance, such as items from the provider/supplier rental fleet, supplied as a t emporary short term rental item must be replaced with new equipment as soon as it is identified the recipient will need the device long term ( no later than in the sixth month of rental ). Payments made on rental fleet -type items will not be applied to the p urchase price of a new item. Purchase or transfer of titles to recipients when the used equipment is from a rental fleet is not allowed. f. For this option, non- routine maintenance and servicing or repairs may be covered for service dates after the item is o wned by the recipient; no sooner than the month following the last rental month. 5. Rental Only Option: a. Only specific equipment Certain items are will be identified by Nevada Medicaid as a rental only. For these items, a monthly rental will be allowed as long as the recipient continues to meet all qualifications and requirements, and the recipient continues to use the device. b. For this option, the DMEPOS supplier retains ownership of the equipment, regardless of the length of rental. As the owner, the DMEPOS supplier is responsible to ensure the equipment remains in safe working condition for the reasonable useful lifetime of th e device. The rental rates include all DRAFT MTL 27/15 CL DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1303 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY October 1, 2015 DME, DISPOSABLE SUPPLIES AND SUPPLEMENTS Section 1303 Page 11 c. supplies and accessories, repairs including routine and non- routine maintenance and servicing, and replacement of items when needed. b. PURCHASE 1. Purchase New Equipment Option: a. Certain products are identified by Nevada Medicaid in the DMEPOS Fee Schedule with a purchase option for new equipment, or can only be purchased, such as disposable supplies and custom -made items which can only be used by that recipient. These will be considered for purchase when, in addition to all other requirements and qualifications for a specific item/device: 1. the anticipated length of need (per physician's order) is long term (more than six months); and 2. the provider will be supplying a new device/item to the recipient; or 3. the item is only available for purchase. 2. Purchase Used Rental Equipment Option: a. Certain Nevada Medicaid identifies specific products are identified by Nevada Medicaid with afor purchase option for used equipment. W when an item was new at the time it was dispensed to a recipient for rental purposes, and prior to billing the third month of rental, it is determined the item will be needed indefinitely, the DHCFP may purchase the item for the recipient for ongoing use. The DHCFP does not purchase used equipme nt from the provider's inventory of rental items used for re - issuance to same or multiple persons over time (rental fleets, etc.). b. The DHCFP will only purchase used equipment when, in addition to all other requirements and qualifications for the item: 1. the recipient meets the criteria for purchase of new equipment; 2. the item was new when placed in the recipient's use and has been used for less than three months ; and DRAFT MTL 27/15 CL DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1303 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY October 1, 2015 DME, DISPOSABLE SUPPLIES AND SUPPLEMENTS Section 1303 Page 12 3. the item is currently being used by the same recipient during a trial period and it has been determined the length of need will now be indefinite. c. A prior authorization must be submitted to request purchase of a used rented piece of equipment item, with all supportive medical documentation to show the date the item was initially issued to the recipient and that the recipient continues to have an ongoing need for the item . 1303.4 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION A. Prior authorization is a review conducted by the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO)-like vendor's medical professionals who review the prior authorization form and any additional information submitted to evaluate medical necessity, appropriateness, location of service, and compliance with t he DHCFP's policy, prior to delivery of service. Reference the MSM, Chapter 100 and the general Billing Manual for detailed information on prior authorizations and Medicaid eligibility for all providers at : http://www.medicaid.nv.gov/providers/BillingInfo.aspx . 1.

Disease conditions such as: cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, and immotile cilia syndrome can lead to abnormal airway clearance which is a source of increased sputum production, often purulent and tena cious; chest physiotherapy (CPT) becomes necessary. In conditions such as CF, excessive tenacious secretions necessitate routine CPT to prevent airway obstruction leading to secondary infection, the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. 2. The standard method of CPT is manual percussion and postural drainage. In the home setting, CPT is administered to the recipient by a trained adult one to three times a day for 20 - 30 minutes per session. 3. FDA approved HFCC (oscillating devices) have been utilized as a n alternative to conventional manual chest physical therapy to promote the clearance of respiratory secretions in patients with impaired ability to cough or otherwise expel them on their own. 4.

Lock -in Program: When a recipient has shown patterns of abuse/misuse of Nevada Medicaid benefits, or the DHCFP has determined that the recipient requires close medical management, the recipient may be \"locked -in\" to a specific pharmacy and/or provider. This means that Medi caid will only pay for controlled substance prescriptions/medical services at a single pharmacy/provider. a. Criteria that is evaluated by the DHCFP when determining if a recipient should be locked in to a specific pharmacy begins with the number of control led substance prescriptions filled in 60 days. If the recipient has filled ten or more controlled substance prescriptions in the past 60 day period (includes controlled substance pharmaceuticals given in the emergency room) then the clinical review contin ues with the following criteria: 1. The recipient has utilized more than one pharmacy in the past 60 day period; 2. The recipient has utilized more than three physicians in the past 60 day period; 3. The recipient has utilized the emergency room(s) for receiving controlled substances; 4. The recipient has been diagnosed with a drug dependency related condition; 5. The dispensed quantity per prescription of controlled substances appears excessive by the clinical review team; or 6. The recipient has other noted drug seeking behaviors(s). b. The POS system will not allow another pharmacy to bill for controlled substance prescriptions, and a message will be given at the time of service to notify the pharmacy that the recipient is locked -in. Any non- controlled substance pr escriptions can be filled at any pharmacy. c. Recipients who are locked -in to one pharmacy can change their locked -in pharmacy at any time by contacting their Medicaid District Office. d. Pharmacies may call the Technical Call Center for an override to the loc ked-in pharmacy if: a.1. The locked -in pharmacy is out of stock.

The locked -in pharmacy is closed. c.3. The recipient is out of town and cannot access the locked- in pharmacy. 3. Generic Substitution Per NRS Chapter 639, if the practitioner has not indicated that generic substitution is prohibited, the pharmacy provider must dispense, in substitution, another drug which is available to him if the other drug: a. is less expensive than the drug prescribed by brand name; b. is biologically equivalent to the drug pres cribed by brand name; c. has the same active ingredient or ingredient of the same strength, quantity and form of dosage as the drug prescribed by brand name; and d. is of the same generic type as the drug prescribed by brand name the least expensive of the dru gs that are available to him for substitution. The pharmacy provider shall substitute the least expensive of the drugs available to him/her for substitution . 5. Prescriber Brand Certification Upper Limit cost limitations specified in this Chapter will not apply when a prescriber certifies that a specific brand of medication is medically necessary for a particular patient. The physician should document in the patient's medical record the need for the brand name product in place of the generic form. The proce dure for certification must comply with the following: a. The certification must be in the physician's own handwriting. b. Certification must be written directly on the prescription blank. c.

For example, if 30 tablets of Metformin are dispensed, the quantity will be 30. Liquids, Liquid Orals, Suspensions, Solutions, Opthalmic/Otic Solutions: must be billed by milliliters (mls). For example, if 560ml of guiafenesin is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 560. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to ml (1 ounce = 30ml). Liters must be converted to ml (1L = 1000ml). Ointments, Bu lk Powders: must be billed by grams. For example, if a two ounce tube of oxiconazole nitrate is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 60. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to grams (1 ounce = 30g, \u00bd ounce = 15g). Oral Contraceptives/Therapy packs: must be billed per \"each\" tablet dispensed, not the number of packages. For example, Ortho Tri -Cyclen is a 28 -day dial pack, the quantity entered will be 28. Transdermal Patches/Powder Packets: must be billed per \"each\" patch/packet dispensed, regardless of whether they are pre -packaged in a box or come in individual pouches/packets.

Liquid Injectables (vials, ampoules): must be billed by milliliters (ml). For example, if a 10ml vial of Novolin 70/30 is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 10. Powdered Injectables (vials): must be billed by \"each\" vial given per dose. For example if the recipient receives Ampicillin 1g every six hours for one week, the quantity entered will be 1, as only one vial is used per dose (assuming a 1gm vial is used), and the # of doses ent ered will be 28 (4 per day x 7 days). PLEASE NOTE: If the product is supplied with a diluent, the quantity entered is only the number of powdered vials dispensed, the diluent is not factored in.
