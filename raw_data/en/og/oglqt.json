The DHSS proceedings to adopt regulations were initiated pursuant to 29 Delaware Code Chapter 101 and authority as prescribed by 16 Delaware Code, subsection 49A. On December 1, 2019 (Volume 23, Issue 6), DHSS published in the Delaware Register of Regulations its notice of proposed regulations, pursuant to 29 Del.C. \u00a710115. It requested that written materials and suggestions from the public concerning the proposed regulations be delivered to DHSS by January 2, 2020, after which time DHSS would review information, factual evidence and public comment to the said proposed regulations. Written comments were received during the public comment period and evaluated. The results of that evaluation are summarized in the accompanying \"Summary of Evidence.\" SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE In accordance with Delaware Law, public notices regarding proposed Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Regulations Governing the Medical Marijuana Code were published in the Delaware Register of Regulations. Written comments were received on the proposed regulations during the public comment period (December 1, 2019 through January 2, 2020). Entities offering written comments include: Comments Columbia Care Columbia Care Delaware LLC (\"Columbia Care\") respectfully submits this letter of comment in relation to the Division of Public Health's (\"DPH\") proposed modifications to the medical marijuana regulations contained within 4470 State of Delaware Medical Marijuana Code. As you know, Columbia Care operates three medical marijuana compassion centers across the State of Delaware, and, as such, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed regulations. We believe DPH's proposed modifications represent thoughtful and important advances in the State's medical marijuana program. Further, we support the State's sophisticated approach to the introduction of edible medical marijuana products. Within this letter, we intend to provide suggestions that we believe will further advance the DPH's interest in continuing to develop a robust, and effective, medical marijuana program for residents. We respectfully request that DPH consider the following suggestions when finalizing these regulations: 1. Modify \u00a711.2.4 to also permit chewable edible medical marijuana products (\"chewables\"), or, alternatively, clarify that the listed forms are not exhaustive of permitted forms of edible medical marijuana products. 2. In \u00a710.3.4, reduce the minimum required font size on product labels below 10-point font type to 6 or 8-point font type. This allows all warnings to fit on smaller cannabis products and is consistent with many other state labeling regulations. 3. Allow the Online Advertising permissions for Marijuana Infused Food Establishments in \u00a711.1.2 to also apply to Medical Marijuana Compassion Centers by adding the same language to \u00a77.0. 4. Modify \u00a7\u00a77.1.4.3; 7.10.2.1 to exclude publicly traded companies from the obligation of providing annual audited financial reports due to the already stringent reporting requirements resulting from their publicly traded status. Alternatively, DPH could create a conditional exemption for publicly traded companies, permitting such companies to satisfy the requirement by instead submitting audited financial statements prepared for the parent company rather than the local compassion center entity. Forms of Edible Medical Marijuana Products, \u00a711.2.4 The proposed regulations present a strong framework for the introduction of edible medical marijuana products, including specific permitted forms for such products. Currently enumerated products include fudge, lollipops, chocolates, and hard candy but chewables are not specifically listed. We would suggest the inclusion of chewables as a permitted form for edible medical marijuana products. In our experience throughout other markets, chewables are typically a preferred form of edible medical marijuana products amongst patients and therefore would increasingly serve the needs of residents in the State. Alternatively, this provision may also be modified to provide that the listed forms are not exhaustive of the permitted forms, and that other forms may be permitted as approved by DPH. This modification may be more desirable as it permits flexibility for future products by enabling DPH to approve subsequent forms without triggering a rewrite of the regulations. 11.2.4 Candy products including, but not limited to chewables, fudge, lollipops, chocolates, and hard candy, are allowed to be manufactured in a Marijuana Infused Food Establishment provided the final products are non-TCS. Labeling of Edible Medical Marijuana Products, \u00a710.3.4 DPH has proposed a robust and expansive list of labeling requirements for edible medical marijuana products. Columbia Care fully supports packaging and labeling techniques that prevent distribution to minors while also providing important information to eligible consumers, which the proposed regulations seem to achieve. We further back DPH's proposed approach of providing certain statements on packaging and labeling while permitting remaining warnings and information to be provided to patients via supplementary materials. However, the proposed 10-point type font may restrict the capability to include important information on the packaging and labeling of edible medical marijuana products. Instead, a lesser font size, perhaps in bold may provide the same clarity to consumers while also permitting the inclusion of more materials on the label should DPH see fit in the future. For example, other states, such as California, have opted to require 6-point type font on labels while requiring that warnings use bold font for emphasis. The use of 6-point font type across the labels with a requirement to emphasize certain, important statements generally creates a more aesthetically pleasing package while also ensuring that patients are sufficiently notified of important product information. 10.3.4 Labels shall be printed in at least 6-point type in a color that provides a clear contrast to the background label. Limitations, Online Sales and Advertising, \u00a711.1.2 Allow the Online Advertising permissions for Marijuana Infused Food Establishments in \u00a711.1.2 to also apply to Medical Marijuana Compassion Centers by adding the same language to \u00a77.0. The proposed inconsistency in advertising regulations provides less opportunity for patients to gain information on where to access medical products and provides more opportunity for people who want to eat at Marijuana Infused Food Establishments (MIFE). We believe this allowance for restaurants and not medical centers may be an oversight since the new language for online advertising is only recently added for MIFEs, but is not included in the previous compassion center provisions. We would greatly appreciate if you also allow online advertising for compassion centers. This inconsistency can be easily rectified by including a provision in \u00a77.0 utilizing the same language or substantially similar language, which is our preferred path forward. 7.1.1.8 Online advertising and marketing are permitted subject to the limitations listed in 16 Del.C. Ch. 49A. Annual Independently Audited Financial Reports, \u00a7\u00a77.1.4.3; 7.10.2.1 Columbia Care appreciates the State's important interest in monitoring the solvency of compassion centers and understands that the State must take steps to hold compassion centers accountable. As the medical marijuana program continues to expand, the necessity of ensuring the right actors are involved grows increasingly important, with financial transparency looming as a paramount metric. However, the imposition of an annual requirement for each compassion center to provide independently audited financial reports may have unintended consequences on compassion centers and the medical marijuana program alike. We believe that either excluding publicly traded companies from submitting annual audited financial reports or creating a conditional exemption permitting publicly traded compassion center licensees to submit parent company level independent financial audits, rather than a local compassion center licensee entity report, presents a mutually beneficial solution to both the State and compassion centers. While cannabis entities are not currently publicly traded in the United States stock exchanges, many entities are publicly traded abroad in foreign stock exchanges. Similar to stock exchanges within the United States, most foreign stock exchanges place a continuing, stringent obligation on publicly traded companies to provide independently audited financial reports on an annual basis. In addition to these annual reports, publicly traded companies also owe traditional duties of good faith and fair dealing to their shareholders, creating an elevated obligation to remain transparent and honest in their financial reports. The annual reports of publicly traded companies offer a greater level of value as they provide a heightened level of transparency and detail on the company's overall financial solvency as a direct result of obligations to shareholders and resulting disclosure requirements. We are licensed in other states that have instituted similar requirements for compassion centers to provide annual, or semi-annual audited financial statements. In many of these states, industry members and regulators are beginning to consider alternative approaches, such as permitting the exclusion of publicly traded companies or allowing such companies to provide audited statements for the parent entity rather than the local licensee entity. In our experience, reports for the local licensee entity are often time consuming for both compassion centers and department staff while offering less value than a report encompassing the entire operations of the parent company. Both the preparation and the regulator review of the reports are burdensome, requiring significant resources and time while diverting attention and efforts away from other, potentially more productive objectives that would further advance the interest of residents and respective marijuana programs - a shared goal between licensees and the state in any medical marijuana program. For these reasons, we believe excluding publicly traded companies from the annual requirement to submit audited financials or permitting such companies to satisfy the obligation by submitting parent company level audited reports, would be in the best interest of compassion centers and the medical marijuana program. 7.1.4.3 An annual financial audit must be conducted by an independent audit firm and submitted to the Department with the compassion center's annual report, provided that compassion center licensee entities that are subsidiaries of publicly traded parent entities may satisfy this requirement by submitting an annual financial audit conducted by an independent audit firm for the parent entity. 7.10.2.1 The compassion center submits materials required under Section subsection 7.9 of these regulations, including a summary annual report with financial audit attached consistent with requirements and applicable exclusions contained in subsection 7.1.4.3 of these regulations, a comprehensive inventory with a cover letter and the $40,000 fee, which shall be refunded if the renewal application is rejected; Conclusion Once again, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to provide these suggestions. Columbia Care is proud to be a contributor to Delaware's impressive medical marijuana program, we look forward to further collaborating on these important updates to the regulations and others to come. Thank you for your consideration of the above comments, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions. Governor's Advisory Council for Exceptional Citizens First, DHSS proposes to amend the definition of \"debilitating medical condition.\" to include terminal illness, seizure disorder, glaucoma, chronic debilitating migraines, and new daily persistent headache. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, cannabis and cannabinoids are also helpful in treating anxiety, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, movement disorders due to Tourette Syndrome, and sleep problems. ( [https://nccih.nih.gov/health/marijuana-cannabinoids#hed11](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/marijuana-cannabinoids#hed11)). Council would like to encourage DHSS to consider adding these additional health conditions to its definition of \"debilitating medical condition.\" Second, DHSS is also proposing to add an additional subsection under the \"debilitating medical condition\" definition that describes the qualifying conditions for individuals under the age of 18. It reads as follows: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety, or depression; seizure disorder; severe debilitating autism; or a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where they have failed treatment involving one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms; and chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; For clarity, Council would like to recommend that DHSS consider using subsection headings to divide each qualifying condition. The section would then read as follows: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to (1) any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety, or depression; (2) seizure disorder;, severe debilitating autism; or, chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; or (3) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where they have failed treatment involving one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms; or; and chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; Alternatively, DHSS could use the same format and division as used in the proposed amended 3.3.3: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to (1) any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety or depression; or (2) intractable epilepsy or seizure disorder; (3) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where the patient has failed treatment involving 1 one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; seizures; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms. spasms; or chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; or (4) severe debilitating autism. Third, DHSS proposes a definitional change involving the addition of the term \"terminal illness\" which includes language similar to the federal definition used for Medicare and Medicaid services. The biggest difference between the two definitions is that the proposed definition gives a life expectancy of 12 months whereas the federal definition gives a life expectancy of six months. Council supports the proposed amendment as it gives more time and allows more individuals access to medical marijuana. Fourth, Section 3.4 adds information on the \"compassionate use card\". The requirements for the compassionate use card are more expansive and cumbersome than those used for the regular registry card because the compassionate use card allows a physician to certify a patient for the card for a medical condition that is not currently covered by the Act. Section 3.4.2 includes the requirement for physicians to re-evaluate the treatment for different medical conditions at different rates including every 15 days for the first 90 days and then every 30 days for substance use disorder; every 30 days for mental health disorders; every 30 days for the first 90 days and then every 90 days for autoimmune disease; and every 30 days for any other conditions. Council would suggest standardizing the timeframes to make the process less confusing. Council would also recommend longer intervals of re-evaluation given how cumbersome these timeframes may be. Fifth, DHSS proposes to make the denial of an application or renewal for a compassionate use card not subject to judicial review. (5.4.4.1). Presently, the denial of an application or renewal for registry identification cards is subject to judicial review in the Superior Court. Council recommends DHSS remove section 5.4.4.1 which would allow denials of applications or renewals for compassionate use cards be subject to judicial review. Sixth, although not presently being amended, Council would like to request that DHSS consider amending section 6.0, which details the procedure for the addition of debilitating medical conditions, or otherwise addresses the lack of published information on denied conditions. Currently, there is only a database for the medical conditions that have been approved to be added as debilitating medical conditions. There is no database containing the medical conditions that have been denied. DHSS considers a petition to add a new debilitating medical condition to have \"merit\" if, among other requirements, the particular medical condition has not been the subject of a petition in the preceding two years. If DHSS also includes information on those petitions that were denied, the date, and the reasoning in the same location as those that have been approved, it would provide consumers and Delawareans with additional information and could prevent the spending of additional staff hours on petitions. [https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/hsp/medmarocpet.html](https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/hsp/medmarocpet.html) Seventh, section 15.3.1 of the proposed addition of the regulations and procedures for Marijuana Infused Food Establishment states the following: \"No animals/pets shall be permitted in the kitchen area of a Marijuana Infused Food Establishment during the preparation, packaging, or handling of any marijuana infused products. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals who utilize service dogs are afforded certain protections under law. Guidance by the Food and Drug Administration explains that in the context of food service: Decisions regarding a food employee or applicant with a disability who needs to use a service animal should be made on a case-by-case basis. An employer must comply with health and safety requirements, but is obligated to consider whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be made. (pg. 537; [https://www.fda.gov/media/87140/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/87140/download)). There may be situations where an employee could have their service dog at work, with precautions in place to prevent handling of the animal during food prep duties. Council supports the amendment but would like to request that DHSS change 15.3.1 to include similar language as the FDA guidance, such as: Decisions regarding a Marijuana Infused Food Establishment employee's use of a service animal should be determined by the employer on a case-by-case basis, considering both health and safety requirements and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be made. (B) Live animals may be allowed in the following situations if the contamination of FOOD; clean EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, and LINENS; and unwrapped SINGLE-SERVICE and SINGLE-USE ARTICLES can not result: (3) In areas that are not used for FOOD preparation and that are usually open for customers, such as dining and sales areas, SERVICE ANIMALS that are controlled by the disabled EMPLOYEE or PERSON, if a health or safety HAZARD will not result from the presence or activities of the SERVICE ANIMAL.\" The Department will use similar language as found in the FDA Food Code with respect to service animals. Employees that utilize service animals will be permitted to do so in a marijuana infused food establishment, as afforded by the Americans with Disabilities Act, except in areas used for food preparation or packaging, as long as a health or safety hazard will not result from the presence or activities of the service animal. The Department will update this section in the regulations for clarity. Nemours Children's Health System Nemours appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed revision of the Delaware Medical Marijuana Program (DMMP) regulations. Our continued concern remains the introduction of edibles\u2014including baked goods such as brownies and cookies, and candy, such as lollipops\u2014at Delaware dispensaries. Nemours strongly opposes the current proposal to expand the DMMP by allowing edible products resembling baked goods and candy. We understand the proposed regulations apply only to products available for purchase and consumption by adult DMMP patients and allow for greater range of non-combustible product selection, however there are significant and severe unintended consequences for children who may confuse and accidentally ingest these products. We believe the DMMP can achieve comparable results for adult patients, with minimal risks for children, by restricting edibles to more traditional forms appropriate for medical use, such as pills, tablets, capsules, chewables, lozenges or liquids. Consumers currently accept these forms for their prescription and over-the-counter medications, and we believe they would do the same for their medical marijuana. A significant majority of states with medical marijuana programs (no recreational) do not allow edibles in the form of baked goods and candy. Delaware's neighboring states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland limit edible forms of medical marijuana to tablets, capsules, lozenges, drops, syrups, oils, and ointments. [1](#ww73), [2](#ww74), [3](#ww75) Delaware has a proud history of prioritizing child well-being when enacting public policy. We urge the Department to carefully consider our recommendations and take all necessary steps to protect our children. Our specific recommendations for your consideration are as follows: Edibles [4](#ww76), [5](#ww77) Further, research supports traditional medical forms for more accurate and precise dosing, as dose estimation for retail edible products is inexact and those consuming edibles often ingest higher amounts of THC than intended.2 Tolerance to the intoxicating effects of oral 9-THC after sustained exposure to high doses2 is well documented. Additionally, imprecise and concentrated cannabis use can be highly detrimental for individuals with mental health conditions or novice medical marijuana users, producing extreme side effects for patients such as hallucinations, or psychosis. It can also worsen mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Particularly, the rise in cannabis potency shows increased risk of Cannabis use disorder, psychosis, acute cognitive impairment and structural brain changes [6](#ww78). It is not clear to us whether the concentrates permitted in this proposed regulation could be used to offer a range of hash oil products such as \"dabs,\" which pose grave risk to health if overconsumed. If \"dabs\" in any form are possible products under this regulation, Nemours recommends adherence to strict packaging and labeling requirements detailed below, in addition to the proposed regulatory changes. Health Matrix: The Journal of Law-Medicine finds \"failure to warn\" likely be the most significant area of cannabis product liability litigation [7](#ww79). Included in this \"failure to warn\" are precise dose limits, whether these medical grade products should be taken with food or water, contraindication warnings, as well as warnings of overdose and/or further instruction for management of overdose6. We continue to strongly urge that medical marijuana products be treated as any other medically regulated product. The DMMP should limit the forms of edible medical marijuana to medically appropriate forms: capsules, pills, tablets, chewables, lozenge, or liquids. Limiting medical marijuana to medically appropriate forms distinguishes medical marijuana from recreational marijuana, and differentiates the product from traditional foods and candies, and allows for multiple forms of ingestion for patients with varying medical needs and/or limitations. Packaging and Labeling The DMMP has made significant progress in terms of proposed regulations on packaging and labeling safeguards to protect children and the general public. We strongly recommend the following changes to align Delaware's program with laws and regulations of other medical marijuana programs around the nation: Thank you, again, for the opportunity to comment. Nemours remains committed to collaborating with your Division in pursuit of optimal child health and development. State Council for Persons with Disabilities The first major relevant definitional change is with the term \"debilitating medical condition.\" DPH proposes to amend this definition to include terminal illness, seizure disorder, glaucoma, chronic debilitating migraines, and new daily persistent headache. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, cannabis and cannabinoids are also helpful in treating anxiety, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, movement disorders due to Tourette Syndrome, and sleep problems. ( [https://nccih.nih.gov/health/marijuana-cannabinoids#hed11](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/marijuana-cannabinoids#hed11)). SCPD encourages DPH to add these additional health conditions to its definition of \"debilitating medical condition.\" DPH is also proposing to add a subsection under the \"debilitating medical condition\" definition that describes the qualifying conditions for individuals under the age of 18. It reads: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety, or depression; seizure disorder; severe debilitating autism; or a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where they have failed treatment involving one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms; and chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; For clarity, SCPD recommends that DPH consider using subsection headings to divide each qualifying condition. It would then read: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to (1) any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety, or depression; (2) intractable seizure disorder;, severe debilitating autism; or, chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; or (3) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where they have failed treatment involving one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms; or; and chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; Alternatively, DPH could use the same format and division as used in the proposed amended 3.3.3: 2.0(c) Pediatric qualifying conditions are limited to (1) any of the following related to a terminal illness: pain, anxiety or depression; or (2) intractable epilepsy or seizure disorder; or (3) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition where the patient has failed treatment involving 1 one or more of the following symptoms: cachexia or wasting syndrome; intractable nausea; seizures; severe, painful and persistent muscle spasms. spasms; or chronic debilitating migraines and new daily persistent headache that are refractory to conventional treatment and interventions; or (4) severe debilitating autism. The second major definitional change involves the proposed amendment to the definition of \"physician.\" DPH is proposing to remove the requirement that a physician be a licensed psychiatrist if the debilitating medical condition is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and expand the options for pediatric physicians to include pediatric psychiatrist and developmental pediatrician. Removing the requirement that a licensed physician be a psychiatrist for PTSD expands the number of doctors/physicians that can recommend medical marijuana treatment for patients, in line with the expansion of pediatric psychiatrists. The third relevant definitional change involves the addition of the term \"terminal illness\" which includes language similar to the federal definition used for Medicare and Medicaid services. The biggest difference between the two definitions is that the proposed definition gives a life-expectancy of 12 months whereas the federal definition gives a life expectancy of 6 months. CPD supports the proposed amendment since it will give greater access to more individuals who may benefit from medical marijuana. The next major change involves the addition of the \"compassionate use card.\" (Section 3.4). The requirements for the compassionate use card are more expansive and cumbersome than those used for the regular registry card because the compassionate use card allows a physician to certify a patient for the card for a medical condition that is not currently covered by the Act. 3.4.2 includes the requirement for physicians to re-evaluate the treatment for different medical conditions at different rates including every 15 days for the first 90 days and then every 30 days for substance use disorder, every 30 days for mental health disorders, every 30 days for the first 90 days and then every 90 days for autoimmune disease, and every 30 days for any other conditions. SCPD recommends longer intervals of re-evaluation given how cumbersome these timeframes may be. In addition, DPH proposes to make the denial of an application or renewal for a compassionate use card not subject to judicial review. (5.4.4.1). Presently, the denial of an application or renewal for registry identification cards is subject to judicial review in the Superior Court. SCPD opposes the approach provided in the proposed regulation and recommends that DPH delete section 5.4.4.1. Deletion of this section would then allow denials of applications or renewals for compassionate use cards to be subject to judicial review. Although not presently being amended, SCPD requests that DPH consider amending section 6.0 which details the procedure for the addition of debilitating medical conditions, or otherwise address the lack of published information on denied conditions. Presently, there is only a database for the medical conditions that are approved to be added as a debilitating medical condition, and not a database for those that have been denied. Given that DPH considers a petition to add a new debilitating medical condition to have \"merit\" if, among other requirements, the particular medical condition has not been the subject of a petition in the preceding two years. If DPH also includes information on those petitions that were denied, the date, and the reasoning in the same location as those that have been approved, it would provide consumers and Delawareans with additional information and could prevent the spending of additional staff hours on petitions. [https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/hsp/medmarocpet.html](https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/hsp/medmarocpet.html) Lastly, in DPH's proposed addition of the regulations and procedures for Marijuana Infused Food Establishment, section 15.3.1 states \"No animals/pets shall be permitted in the kitchen area of a Marijuana Infused Food Establishment during the preparation, packaging, or handling of any marijuana infused products.\" Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals who utilize service dogs are afforded certain protections under law. Guidance by the Food and Drug Administration explains that in the context of food service: Decisions regarding a food employee or applicant with a disability who needs to use a service animal should be made on a case-by-case basis. An employer must comply with health and safety requirements, but is obligated to consider whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be made. (pg. 537; [https://www.fda.gov/media/87140/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/87140/download)). There may be situations where an employee could have their service dog at work, with precautions in place to prevent handling of the animal during food prep duties. SCPD recommends that DPH change 15.3.1 to include language similar to the FDA guidance, such as: Decisions regarding a Marijuana Infused Food Establishment employee's use of a service animal as defined by Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and/or Delaware Equal Accommodations Law (DEAL) should be determined by the employer on a case-by-case basis, considering both health and safety requirements and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be made. (B) Live animals may be allowed in the following situations if the contamination of FOOD; clean EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, and LINENS; and unwrapped SINGLE-SERVICE and SINGLE-USE ARTICLES can not result: (3) In areas that are not used for FOOD preparation and that are usually open for customers, such as dining and sales areas, SERVICE ANIMALS that are controlled by the disabled EMPLOYEE or PERSON, if a health or safety HAZARD will not result from the presence or activities of the SERVICE ANIMAL.\" The Division will use similar language as found in the FDA Food Code with respect to service animals. Employees that utilize service animals will be permitted to do so in a marijuana infused food establishment, as afforded by the Americans with Disabilities Act, except in areas used for food preparation or packaging, as long as a health or safety hazard will not result from the presence or activities of the service animal. The Department will update this section in the regulations for clarity. FINDINGS OF FACT: Some changes were made to the regulations since publication as proposed.
