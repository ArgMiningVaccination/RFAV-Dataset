The primary accreditation organization for undergraduate medical education is the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (www.lcme.org ) is the nationally recognized accrediting authority for medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree in U.S. and Canadian medical schools. The LCME is jointly sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association. All state licensing boards in the United States require graduation from an LCME -accredited school to be eligible for licensure as an allopathic physician. The LCME has a three -step process for granting accreditation to new medical schools: preliminary accreditation granted prior to recruiting the charter class of students (granted to UCF College of Medicine on February 5, 2008); provisional accreditation, grant ed during the second year of operation of the Charter class (granted to UCF College of Medicine on June 20, 2011) ; and full accreditation, granted on February 11, 2013, during the fourth year of the Charter class. 14 Medical Education that Creates Opportunity The M.D. Program learning experience at UCF is a unique and exciting blend of state -of-the art technology, virtual patients, clinical and laboratory experiences, research, facilitator -directed small group sessions, and interactive didactic lec tures . Classes include live patient interaction . Innovative simulation and animation experiences have been developed explicitly for the study of medicine that integrate and reinforce the curriculum . From basic science concepts to clinical diagnoses and treatment s, the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center enhance s and complement s learning. The M.D. Program curriculum at UCF fully integrates basic and clinical sciences across all four years . The first two years of the curriculum are structured into modules with the first year focusing on a fundamental understanding of how the various basic science disciplines relate to the normal human body . The second year takes an organ system -based approach and applies the basic knowledge of the first year to the study of clinical disease, pathological processes and treatment . In concert with these aspects of medicine the curriculum presents psychosocial issues, cultural differences, communication skills, and physical diagnosis skills as they relate to the different topics in medicine. Educational experiences throughout the curriculum are designed to enhance the learning environment, emphasize student -centered learning, application and synthesis of information, and foster an appreciation of life -long learning . All modaliti es of learning are incorporated into the curriculum including interactive lectures using audience response systems, simulation, Web -based activities and clinical cases, team -based learning, and standardized patient encounters . Clinical experiences occur throughout the first two years in the Practice of Medicine . Students work with community preceptors in a variety of settings, including primary care, specialty practices and hospital - based practices . These clinical experiences provide students the opportun ity to observe the application of their studies to real patients, as they gain experience in communication, history taking, physical exam skills, and cultural competency. An exciting component of the curriculum at UCF is best described by the Dean as the \"Keep the Dream Alive\" module. This Focused Individual Research Experience (FIRE) module continues throughout the first two years . The scope of these projects is limited only by the student's imagination, and may include every aspect from bench to clinical research, quality of care, hospitality in medicine, quality of life, disease prevention, legal aspects of medicine, and more . Each student work s with a mentor to develop an individualized project or area of study that focuses on the student's unique inter est in medicine. The third and fo urth years of the curriculum are devoted to clinical experience through clerkships, selectives, and electives . Fundamental knowledge from the first two years is reinforced through lectures, simulations, journal clubs, and conferences during the six core clerkships . 15 Overall, the four -year medical curriculum at UCF is designed to fully integrate basic science s and clinical medicine, giving students an appreciation of cultural diversity and the need for sensitivity in treati ng patients, foster professional ism in all interactions, and ignite a passion for lifelong learning. 16 College of Medicine's Mission, Values, Vision, Goals, Strategic Initiatives Mission The University of Central Florida College of Medicine educates and inspires individuals to be exemplary physicians and scientists, leaders in medicine, scholars in discovery, and adopters of innovative technology to improve the health and well -being of all.

In addition, UCF College of Medicine encourages applications from a diverse population and values diversity in the medical program . Admissions decisions are made on the basis of a wide variety of information provided in the admissions package of each applicant . The Medical Student Admissions Committee (MSAC) consider s factors such as academic qualifications, demonstra ted humanism and empathy, research and work experience, teamwork and leadership skills, as well as motivation for medicine . An applicant's character, integrity and general fitness to practice a particular profession may also be considered in the admission process . Admission to the M.D. Program is competitive and although qualified, many applicants will not be invited for an interview. Role of the Admissions Office The College of Medicine M.D. Admissions Office guides students through the medical application and admissions processes . The office develops and implements a College of Medicine recruiting plan that serves to fulfill the mission of the college . The College of Medicine Admissions Office manages the M.D. admissions process for the college . As such, the office is primarily responsible for overseeing the recruitment, application, interview and admissions processes ensuring that they are in compliance with all College of Medicine , UCF, state and American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) governing directives . The Admissions Office work s in tandem with the MSAC and other College of Medicine offices to ensure that each matriculated class embodies strength in academics, research, work experiences, professional goals and skills, professionalism and medical motivation that contribute s to a diverse, team -oriented, culturally competent classroom . The Admissions Office provides administrative support to the MSAC chair and committee. The Admissions Office use s the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) as the primary application processing system and work s with College of Medicine and UCF offices to ensure that supporting data is made available on a timely basis . The College of Medicine Admissions Office both receive s and maintain s appli cant file components in electronic format whenever possible. 19 Applicant Recruiting As the primary recruiting office for applicants to the M.D. Program, the Admissions Office represent s the program and use s all means necessary to ensure that viable applicant s understand the mission, culture and objectives of the College of Medicine . The Admissions Office participate s in as many medical student forums and meetings as deemed appropriate to achieve a diverse, motivated and academically solid student body . The Ad missions Office work s closely with undergraduate program advisors and special high school advisors to ensure that their students have been prepared properly to begin the medical school application process . This office is also the primary office to provide program advising to applicants to ensure that they understand the application and admissions process . They work with applicants who were not accepted to help them to understand the areas where their application may be strengthened for possible success in a future application year . Finally, the Admissions Office attend s AAMC and other meetings deemed necessary to ensure that the office is cognizant of all admissions rules and requirements. International Applicants As a state -supported M.D. Program in Florida with a mission to produce more physicians for the population of the state, only applicants who are U.S . Citizens or who are Permanent Resident Aliens or Asylees with permanent INS documentation in their possession will be allowed to matriculate . Applicant files t hat are not one of these three groups will not be considered for an interview. Admissions with Advanced Standing (Transfer ) The M.D. Program does not plan to accept Advanced Standing (Transfer) applicants for the first several years of the admissions cycle . Application Process The only method by which applicants (excluding transfer applicants) may apply to the UCF M.D. Program is through the on -line American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) . AMCAS is the national application serv ice that processes applications for M.D. Programs throughout the nation . Through AMCAS, an applicant may apply to most M.D. Program s by completing one application document and paying the appropriate fees . AMCAS is considered a service organization to both the student and the school . Although there is an application fee to the student, the institution is not charged for any of the services that AMCAS provides . In addition to processing the application (which includes the verification of all college grades), AMCAS provides the school with current, categorically summarized information regarding all applicants immediately upon completion of AMCAS transcript verification . The AMCAS a pplication period begins i n late May and, for most M.D. Program s, terminates on or before December 1st of the year prior to that year in which the applicant anticip ates matriculation . The AMCAS application deadline is the date by which the applicant must have their application, all fees and associated data verified by AMCAS . Schools a re allowed to make exceptions to the established deadline date for individual applicants when deemed appropriate by the Admissions Offic e. This institution honor s the AMCAS Fee Assistance Program waiver as a basis for waiving the Supplemental Application Fee. 20 The M.D. Program will evaluate completed applications from both residents and nonresidents of the state of Florida . Qualified non -Florida residents may be invited for an interview . As a state -supported institution, a large majority of each matriculatin g class will be composed of Florida residents. Required Academic Coursework The College of Medicine has established certain required academic prerequisite coursework for admissions . These requirements must be taken in residence (not online) from a properly accredited college or university in the United States . Applicants must also have completed at least a bachelor's - level degree prior to matriculation into the M.D. Program. General Biology 2 Semesters (with labs) General Chemistry 2 Semesters (with l abs) Organic Chemistry 2 Semesters (with labs) General Physics 2 Semesters (with labs) College English 2 Semesters College Math 2 Semesters Please note that the College of Medicine does not recommend or encourage an undergraduate college major in any discipline as the \"best\" major for entry to the M.D. Program . Undergraduate majors in either the humanities or sciences are equally acceptable as students are encouraged to follow their own desires when pursuing majors . The College of Medicine re cognizes that both the sciences and the humanities are essential to the practice of medicine and encourages studies in that applicant's area of interest . Non-science majors are encouraged to take as many science courses as possible to assist the MSAC in un derstanding t he applicant's science aptitude . Additional coursework that is recommended, but not required, includes biochemistry (with lab) , embryology, cell biology, comparative anatomy and genetics . Coursework in humanities, natural sciences or communication arts is also encouraged . While no specific college math courses are required, some colle ge work in calculus is strongly recommended; familiarity with the principles of statistics for analysis of data is also important. For those applicants wh o have completed upper -level degrees, all academics are considered and some of the undergraduate prerequisites may be substituted with upper -level coursework in the same discipline . Requirements for Interview Consideration In addition to the coursework noted in the preceding section, the College of Medicine expects that each applicant selected for admissions will have demonstrated strong academic skills as well as a motivation for medicine and compassion for others . As such, all applicants invited for an interview should have achieved a minimum of a 3.00 overall and science GPA and have scored a minimum of a 24 on a single MCAT exam which is not older than the last 3 application cycles ( i.e. an applicant for the class enterin g in 21 August 2013 must have taken the MCAT in 2010 -2012 ). Applicants competitive for an interview should have demonstrated a strong motivation for medicine by having consistently participated in meaningful volunteerism, both in the medical and community ser vice areas . Furthermore, motivated applicants are expected to have participated in some physician shadowing and also have demonstrated teamwork, leadership and preferably basic science lab oratory research skills. State Residency Classification The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for all first - time -on-campus medical students; the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar 's office reviews student requests for changes in residency once the student is enrolled . A firs t-time -on-campus student will be classified according to the information he or she includes on the application for admission and state residency affidavit, providing that no other information is available that calls into question the information contained on these documents . The M.D. Admissions Office strictly observes the Florida Residency Guidelines, and no exceptions will be made regarding a student's legal state of residence unless it is in accordance with the office of general counsel. The Application File The major portion of the applicant file is maintained electronically in the AMCAS system. AMCAS updates schools with information initiated by the applicant and, using official school transcripts, verifies the academic work of the student . The M.D. Adm issions Office collect s additional documents submitted on behalf of an applicant and monitors all files until they are complete or until the application deadline has passed . A completed application consist s of the following items at a minimum: - Verified AMCAS Application - Completed Supplemental Application - Letters of Recommendation (via AMCAS only) o three Faculty Recommendation Letters OR Pre -professional Committee Letter o two Character Recommendation Letters - Application Fee o r AMCAS Fee Waiver Designator - Passport Type Photo (Requested but not required for completion of file) - Official Transcripts (after Acceptance) - State Residency Affidavit (after Acceptance) - Additional Information Provided by the Applicant (Optional) o Letters providing updated or amplifying i nformation o Recent Grade Sheets/Transcript o U.S. Citizenship Forms o Change of Name Information The M.D. Admissions Office will send an e-mail to each applicant immediately upon file completion and will continue to provide status updates via the Supplemental A pplicant dashboard as warranted . It is the responsibility of each applicant to meet established deadlines and to monitor completion of their application . 22 The M.D. Admissions Office maintain s the electronic/paper files for all applicants that contain all o f the above as well as any other documentation which is pertinent to the applicant for each application year . While in the M.D. Admissions Office, all applicant files are treated as privileged and confidential information . None of the data will be shown to the applicant or any other individual that does not have the need to view the information in the course of their own university business responsibility . Upon the date of matriculation, the M.D. Admissions Office will provide all appropriate documentation to the College of Medicine M.D. R egistrar Office which will begin the student educational record that is subject to FERPA Guidelines . Initial Screening of Applicants The initial indication that an applicant has begun the application process is provided by AMCAS . The M.D. Admissions Office communicate s with applican ts upon receipt of a verified AMCAS application and ensure s that qualified applicants receive Supplem entary Applications . Once all components of the applicant file have been received , the Directo r of Admissions for the M.D. Program review s the file to ensure that the applicant meets, or will meet, all requirements for admission prior to matriculation . Files that meet all requirements are evaluated by being placed in a pool of applicants which may be selected for an interview . Files that do not appear to meet all requirements are reviewed by the Director of Admissions and the MSAC chair to determine whether to reject the application or allow it to remain in the poo l for possible interview selection . The M.D. Admissions Office will release Letters of Rejection to all applicants as sanctioned by the MSAC chair. Interview Selection Guidelines The MSAC chair work s in tandem with the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program to ensure that all applicants chosen for an interview are those who are not only academically talented, but also have demonstrated the desire to pursue medicine . As such, during the rolling admissions process, the Director of Admissions for the M.D . Program constantly review s the pool of interview -ready applications to select the best students available for interview . Those students should have averages which meet or exceed the committee's minimum GPA and MCAT scores . Ideally, those selected for an interview should have: - experienced meaningful and consistent medical clinical activities - demonstrated consistent service to the community - shadowed a physician - displayed teamwork and leadership skills - participated in basic science research - showed perseverance or excelled in an activity (sports, research, etc.) at a very high level Not all applicants selected for an interview will have all of the qualities listed above; however, the Admissions Office seek s to interview applicants who are academicall y solid, motivated for medicine and bring diversity to the classroom. 23 Interview Day Once an interview group has been created and the applicants have selected an interview date, the Admissions Office provide s the applicant with an e-mail confirming the date of interview . This confirmation e-mail provide s additional information to include an agenda and information regarding overnight stay, local travel, parking and other details to enhance the applicant's visit . The interview day structure incl udes a visit of approximately seven hours which includes interviews, program overview, student financial information, a visit to a clinical training site, tour of the medical education building, interaction with current students and administrators, and a discussion regar ding the admission and acceptance process. Notification of Acceptance, Rejection or Wait Listing When the MSAC has made a final decision regarding each interviewed applicant, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. program make s immediate contact with each applicant via telephone to inform them of th e committee decision . MSAC meetings normally occur within two weeks of the applicant's interview visit . Acceptance Packages Acceptance packages include an Acceptance Letter signed by the MSAC chair . Other items in the package include a copy of the College of Medicine Technical Standards and a Technical Standards Response Form . A written response is desired from the applicant within two weeks of the date of the acceptance letter . The response letter from the applicant should also include the Technical Standards Response Form . If a response letter is not received from the applicant, the Admissions Office will make every effort to contact the applicant to determine their intent . Technical Standards Response Form s are filed with the applicant's response to the acceptance offer in the Admissions File . Those Technical Standards Response Forms which indicate that an accommodation may be necessary are forwarded immediately to the Office of Student Affairs for further action. Official Transcripts All applicants that have been selected for admission to the M.D. Program must provide an official transcript showing a bachelor's degree earned at a regionally accredited U.S. institution to the College of Medicine M.D. A dmissi ons Office prior to matriculation . To be official, transcripts and diploma/degree certificate must bear the original seal or signature of the school's registrar or of the appropriate school official or office . An official transcript bearing the applicant's bachelor's degree must be provided prior to matriculation. Criminal Background Checks Accepted applicants ' Criminal Background Checks (CBC) are currently funded by AMCAS . AMCAS initiate s the CBC process after January 1st, for all applicant s that have been accepted by any AMCAS member institution . As additional institutions offer acceptance to that applicant, they too will be provided access to the result of the original CBC . 24 Technical Standards for Medical School Admission, Academic Progression and Gradu ation The M.D. Program educates physicians who are capable of entering residency training (graduate medical education) and meet all requirements for medical licensure. All candidates are evaluated according to the same standards and criteria. Delineation of technical standards is required for the accreditation of U.S. medical schools by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The technical standards describe the essential abilities required of all candidates. Reasonable accommodation in achie vement of the standards is defined under federal statutes applied to individuals with disabilities. Such accommodations are intended to support the successful completion of all components of the M.D. degree. The technical standards for the M.D. degree are applied in concert with other policies of the university, including academic policies, academic standards established by the faculty, and student conduct policies. Standards in five areas must be met by all candidates: Observation, Communication, Motor Function, Cognitive Standards, and Professionalism. 1. Observation Candidates are reasonably expected to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences; observe patients at a distance and close at hand; demonstrate sufficient use of the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical examination; and integrate findings based on these observations and to develop an appropriate diagnostic an d treatment plan. 2. Communication Candidates are reasonably expected to communicate in verbal and written form with health care professionals and patients, including eliciting a complete medical history and recording information regarding patients' conditio ns; perceive relevant non verbal communications such as changes in mood, activity, and posture as part of a physical examination of a patient; establish therapeutic relationships with patients; and demonstrate reading skills at a level sufficient to indivi dually accomplish curricular requirements and provide clinical care for patients using written information. Accommodation through use of a trained intermediary or other communications aide may be appropriate when this intermediary functions as an informat ion conduit. 25 3. Motor Function Candidates' motor and sensory functions must be sufficient to diagnose and deliver effective patient care by consistently, quickly, and accurately integrating all data gathered through whatever sense(s) employed. Candidates are reasonably expected to perform physical examinations and diagnostic procedures, using such techniques as palpation, auscultation, and percussion; complete routine invasive procedures as part of training, using universal precautions without substantial risk of infection to patients; perform basic laboratory tests and evaluate routine diagnostic tools such as EKGs and Xrays; respond in emergency situations to provide the level of care reasonably required of physicians; and participate effectively in phy sically taxing duties over long hours and complete timed demonstrations of skills. 4.

If a student withdraws from coursework while an alleged academically dishonest act is under consideration and the case is not subsequently resolved in favor of the student, the college reserves the right to assign the appropriate grade for the coursework . Holds A hold (negative service indicator) may be placed on a student's records, transcripts, grades, diplo mas or registration due to financi al or other obligations to the u niversity . Satisfaction and clearance of the hold is required before a release can be given . Students may check for holds at https://my.ucf.edu . To obtain an immediate release for a financial hold, payment to the UCF Main Campus C ashier's Office must be made either in cash, credit card, cashier's check or money order. Records The College of Medicine M.D. R egistrar is responsible for maintaining permanent records and documents that pertain to each matriculated student's progress through medical school . These records include application materials, medical school evaluations , official transcripts of all medical school coursework, documentation of grade change s, USMLE scores and USMLE ID number, official dates of enrollment, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), documentation of dismissal or withdrawal, copy of diploma, copy of Federation of State Medical Boards and other state licensing forms . The pro cedures used in managing these records are consistent with established standards and existing regulations . As a student, the educational records are considered confidential . Under most circumstances an individual student's records will not be release d with out the student's written and signed consent. Student records are maintained electronically within a secure infrastructure . The College of Medicine M.D. R egistrar provides access to student records to faculty and administrative staff with a legitimate educational interest . Students have the right, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to inspect and review their educational records . Student r ecords submitted to the university 29 become the property of the university and cannot be returned to or copied for the student or released to a third party . Student records are digitally scanned . Students may request to amend their records under the provisio ns outlined in the regulation . Challenges to medical student academic records will follow the appeal process included in the university 's Golden Rule to be adapted for the College of Medicine. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The procedures for protecting the confidentiality of student records are based on state regulations and the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) . FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records . They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days (State of Florida law = 30 days) of the day the university receives a written request for access . Students should submit to th e College of Medicine M.D. Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they desire to inspect . The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected . If the reco rds are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, t hat official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed ; 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate . Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the university official responsible for the rec ord, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student o f his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing ; 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identif iable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent . One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational inter ests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks . A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility; and 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education conc erning alleged failures by a state university to comply with the requirements of FERPA . The name and address of the office that administers FERPA are : Family Policy Compliance Office 30 U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington DC, 20202 -4605 Directory Info Under the provisions of the FERPA , students have the right to withhold the release of the following items designated by UCF as \"Directory Information :\" name current mailing address telephone number date of birth major field of study dates of attendance enrollment status degrees and awards received participation in officially registered activities and sports athletes' height and weight Unless otherwise indicated, these informational items may be released at the discr etion of th e university. The university will honor a student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" until such time as that student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" is rescinded . Until such rescindment is affected, the university will continue to withhold such information, even after enrollment has terminated. For more information, please refer to the Student Rights to Privacy (FERPA) . Higher Education Act Lists, descr iptions and sources of information required for disclosure under the Higher Education Act may be obtained from the UCF registrar's office (Millican Hall 161) or from the UCF registrar's website http://regi strar.sdes.ucf.edu/hea/ . Name Changes To change the legal name maintained on the student's official UCF record, the student must submit a completed \"Change of Name\" form and supporting documentation to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar . A copy of a l egal name change document (e.g., marriage certificate, divorce decree, etc.) must be attached to the form . The \"Change of Name\" form is available online at http://www.med.ucf.edu/academics/registrar/forms.asp . Address and E -mail Changes To communicate in a more expedient manner, UCF uses e-mail as the primary means of notifying students of important university business and information dealing with registratio n, deadlines, financial assistance, schola rships, tuition and fees, etc . The College of Medicine sends all business -related and 31 academic messages to a student's Knights e-mail address to ensure that there is one repository for that information . It is criti cal that students maintain and regularly check their Knights e-mail account for official announcements and notifications . Communications sent to the Knights e-mail address on record will be deemed adequate notice for all u niversity communication, including issues related to academics, finances, registration, parking, and all other matters . The university does not accept responsibility if official communication is rejected or fails to reach a student who has not registered for, or maintained and checked on a regular basis, their Knights e-mail account. Students must ensure that permanent and mailing (local) addresses and telephone numbers are current with the university at al l times. Students can update their contact information online at https://my.ucf.edu . Transcript Requests Official UCF transcripts are requested using the new online ordering process. All currently enrolled students have access via the Student Portal at: https://my.ucf.edu . Telephone and e-mail requests are not accepted . Transcripts cannot be released if the student has a hold due to a financial obligation to the university . Transcript requests must include the student's signature, full name, identification number and the name and complete address of the person(s) or organ izations to which transcripts are to be sent . If final grades or degree statement are needed, a student may indicate that the transcript request is to be held until all requested data are posted. Official transcript cost s for the M.D. program have been a ssessed as part of yearly fees ; consequently, transcripts are provided to enrolled students at no charge . However, the transcript cost for other UCF undergraduate and graduate programs is $10 per copy effective January 1, 2008. There is a transcript fee of $10 per transc ript for requests made one year after graduation or withdrawal from the program. Full -time Enrollment Requirements All students enrolled in the M.D. Program must attend full -time and take the educational modules as a cohort group . Exceptions to these enrollment requirements are granted only in cases of documented medical hardship . Requests for an exception should be directed to the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Students in writing . Registration in Term of Graduation A student must b e registered in a term in which the College of Medicine faculty or administrative and professional time are required (e.g., for review of thesis or research report by faculty or editorial staff, for completion of internships, or for comprehensive or other examinations). Certification of Degree Completion The College of Medicine certifies that all program and college requirements have been met . Degree certification is prepared in the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office and forwarded to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (M4) for final determination that all requirements for the M.D. degree have been met . Medical students who have completed all the requirements for the degree and 32 have successfully completed the required clerkships may requ est a letter to that effect prior to the receipt of the degree . Such letters will be issued by the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. Grade System The college use s a letter system for the M.D. Program where grades are assigned for overall performance in a given module or clerkship . Students' performance in academic course work are evaluated by assignment of grades of (A) Excellent Performance, (B) Good Performance, (C) Conditional Performance, in order of excellence . The (F) grade (Unacceptable Performance) is given to students who fail a module/clerkship, who demonstrate inappropriate professional behaviors, or who fail to attend or participate in required course activities . Other grade actions include an (I) showing incomplete work, a (W) indicating that a student withdrew from the course, an (R*) followed by a grade showing that the student repeated the course (Grade Forgiveness), and a (T) used as a \"temporary grade\" for performance pending review by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee ( SEPC ). See below for further explanation of the (T) grade. Faculty may specify that some programs (selectives/electives) can be graded using a (P) pass/ (F) fail grade designation . All grade options for the program are subject to approval by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee. The instructor assigns an I (incomplete grade) when a student is unable to complete a module or clerkship due to extenuating circumstances, and when all requirements can clearly be completed in a short time following the close of regular classes . In all circumstances where a student receives an (I), the student and faculty member must complete an agreement that specifies how and when the incomplete grade will be made up, which will be considered by the appropriate SEPC . All students receiving financial assistance (federal and institutional loans), will be cautioned that the terms of the assistance require that the (I) grade must be made up by the agreement date . Minimal competency in each module/clerkship is a composite score of 70 or above (A, B or C grade). A (T) entry identifies students whose performance, although within the passing range, requires study and reevaluation in one or more areas within the module/clerkship . A (T) i s used as a \"temporary grade\" for module/clerkship grades when students have achieved an overall score that would indicate a passing grade, but they have shown weak or marginal performance in one or more of the traditional subject areas that are included i n the overall module/clerkship . The overall performance of students receiving a (T) in lieu of a grade is reviewed by the SEPC with the Module/Clerkship Director to determine how the student may improve their fund of knowledge in the identified subject area(s) . The (T) grade is replaced by the final module/clerkship grade when remediation is successfully accomplished in knowledge , skills, attitudes and/or behavior. Unsuccessful remediation may result in a failing grade. Individual Module or Clerkship Directors specify how performance on assigned work is related to this grading scale in the particular module or clerkship . The fina l grade assigned for the module is recorded on the official transcript . However, because the pre-clerkship modules are integrated or organ system - based but involve a number of traditional basic science disciplines, Module Director s will also record 33 perform ance in those areas as well . Where appropriate, the Module Director will assign a (T) grade to indicate that the student's performance in one or more discipline areas falls in the conditional or unacceptable range . Similarly, Clerkship Director s may assign a (T) grade to indicate that a particular student's knowledge, skill or professionalism is conditional or unacceptable in a particular area, even though the student's overall performance is excellent or good . Assigned (T) grades with annotations are used by the SEPC in its review of an individual student. A student may appeal his or her exam or course grade if he or she feels that the grade was assigned in a manner not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy distributed at the beginning of the module or clerkship. This is not a process for appeal of established module or clerkship grading policies. The appeal is directed initially to the Module or Clerkship Director an d then to the Assistant Dean of Medical Education for resolut ion at an informal level. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs stating the reasons for the appeal. After an appropriate hearing and revi ew, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the University President's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 15 business days of receipt of the student's request for review. Medical students are assigned a personal portal on the MyUCF web site where final grades, notices and announcements are posted . In addition, each medical student receive s a secured portal into a personal web site using CANVAS (Webcourses) where instructional module notices and assignments are posted . Classification of Modules/Courses 6000 -6999 Advanced graduate level modules . These modules are designed to build upon the beginning graduate level courses/modules and to deliver more advanced content and experiences. 7000 -7999 Doctoral level courses . These courses provide material at the most advanced graduate level. Florida's Statewide Module/Course Numbering System Modules/co urses in this Bulletin are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS) . This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by thirty -three nonpublic institut ions. Students and administrators can use the online Statewide Course Numbering System to obtain course descriptions . The information is at the SCNS website: http://scns.fldoe.org . 34 Validity of Submitted Documents If the college finds that an applicant has made a false or fraudulent statement or a deliberate omission on the application, residency affidavit, health report, or any accompanying document or statement, that applicant will be denied admission . If the stud ent is enrolled when such fraud is discovered, the student is immediately withdrawn (with no refund), denied further enrollment and invalidated on credit and any degree based on such credit . Actions for this type of offense are handled administratively by the Office of Student Affairs after notification to the alleged violator and hearing by that office. Leave of Absence Students who are unable to continue enrollment or complete required instructional modules or clerkships due to illness, maternity leave of absence, hardship or special circumstances must immediately contact the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine. A student requesting a leave of absence must submit a letter outlining the reasons for the request and timetable for return to the Associate Dean for Students. The associate Dean for Students may approve a leave of absence for up to one calendar year. Any incomplete course work must be completed by the time specified in the letter to the student sent by the associate Dean for Students. Leaves requested for a long er period are approved only in exceptional circumstances. Extension requests must be made in writing to the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee before the expiration of the original leave of absence. Note that for purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a school -approved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. Students on approved College of Medicine leave of absence must notify the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine in writing of his or her intent to re -enroll at least three months prior to the date they wish to return to medical studies. For leaves of absence of less than six months' duration, this notification must be at least two months prior to the date they wish to return to medical studies. The M.D. Program at the College of Medicine does not permit auditing of modules . Modules are only available to students enrolled in the M.D. Program . Residency Reclassification for Tuition Purposes The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for tuition purposes for all newly admitted students at the College of Medicine . Thereafter, the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office review s requests for changes in residency. To request a residency review, the student must submit a completed \"Residency Reclassification Request Form\" and supporting documents to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office . This form is available either at the UCF registrar's office or online at http://registrar.ucf.edu/ . The reclassification form must be accompanied by all documents that support the student's Florida residency claim . Residency reclassification requests are subject to Florida Statute 10 09.21 (formerly 240.1201), Florida 35 State Board of Education Administrative Code 6A -10.44 and State Board of Education rule 6C -7.005 . In addition, university policy requires students requesting residency reclassification to provide documentation establishin g that they have income or personal resources to meet financial obligations of attendance and living expenses . Contact the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office for additional information regarding all residency reclassification requirements. When b uilding a case for Florida residency for tuition purposes, the student may choose to submit documents from a variety of categories . Students may consult the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office before submitting the reclassification request and supp orting documents . The submission of documents in itself does not qualify the student for Florida residency for tuition purposes. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office will evaluate the submitted documents and available information and will render an eligibility determination . UCF is authorized to make discretionary judgments as to residency within the bounds of the law and in reaching this professional judgment will evaluate all documents submitted and information available . No single document sha ll be conclusive. Students seeking residency reclassification should understand that living in or attending college in Florida is not tantamount to establishing residency in Florida for tuition purposes . The student who comes to Florida to enroll in a Flo rida post -secondary educational institution as an out -of-state resident and continuously enrolls in a Florida institution normally will not meet the Florida residency requirement for in -state tuition regardless of the length of time enrolled . Living or att ending school in Florida merely evidences physical presence . The student must provide documentation verifying that he or she has formed significant legal ties to the s tate of Florida . This documentation must establish that the Florida residence constitutes a bona fide domicile rather than serving the purpose of maintaining a mere temporary residence or abode incident to enrollment in an institution of higher education . Evidence establishing legal ties to states other than Florida may disqualify the student from Florida residency for tuition purposes . All determinative documents must be dated at least 12 months before the first day of class for the term in which residency is sought. New and continuing students who believe that they qualify for Florida resid ency for tuition purposes must submit the request and all documents prior to the end of \"Late Registration\" for the term in which Florida residency is requested . Documentation received after the last day of \"Late Registration\" will not be used to determine residency for the current term . Approved residency reclassification will not be applied retroactively to previous terms. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office may require additional documentation beyond that initially submitted by the student or the claimant before it can render a reclassification eligibility determination and it will not complete its review of the residency reclassification application until both the student and the claimant have submitted all requested documents. 36 Satisfactory Academic Progress M.D. students at UCF College of Medicine who receive Title IV aid must meet the following Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Institutional aid also requires the attainment of these standards with exceptions determined b y the Associate Dean for Students. Background All M.D. students are enrolled full -time while in attendance at UCF College of Medicine. Students proceed through the four years of study with class levels delineated at M1, M2, M3 and M4. Medical students' aca demic, clinical and professional performance is reviewed by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) on a regular basis. During the Annual Evaluation, each student will be reviewed to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study. M.D. students do not receive calculated grade point averages. The outcome of each student's Annual Evaluation is shared by the Registrar with the Office of Student Financial Services (SFS). Academic progress for financial aid purposes occurs at the end of every year, coinciding with the SEPC Annual Evaluation. The M.D. program's academic term is equal to one academic year. Students that do not meet SAP standards are notified via email and are invited in for a one -on-one session with the staff of Student Financial Services to review the policy and the student's status. Quantitative Standards The maximum time frame to complete the four year medical school program is six years from the date that the student starts the program. The student must have completed two years successfully by the end of the fourth year of enrollment. If the student is not maintaining the required pace to complete the degree within six years, the student becomes ineligible for financial aid. Any exception s due to extenuating circumstances must be granted by the Associate Dean for Students. Qua litative Standards The SEPC evaluates students at the end of each academic year. In order to meet SAP, students must be deemed by the SEPC to meet satisfactory acade mic progress toward the program goals and objectives. Appeals and Financial Aid Probation Students who become ineligible to receive aid will be notified in writing of their ineligibility status and have the right to submit an appeal for reinstatement of a id on the basis of injury, illness, death of a relative or other special circumstance. The appeal must include: the reasons why the student failed to make satisfactory academic progress and a statement explaining what has changed in the student's situation that will allow satisfactory academic pr ogress at the next evaluation. Documentation to support the student's appeal must be attached. If it is determined that the student will be able to meet standards again after the subsequent payment period, or if an academic plan is developed that when followed will ensure the student will meet the standards by the end of a specific time, then the appeal may be approved so that the student can be placed on financial aid probation and receive Title IV aid. 37 Academic progress will be reviewed again at the end of the probationary year. Probationary students who meet academic progress standards will be released from probation and are eligible for Title IV aid. Probationary students who fail to meet academic progress stan dards at the end of the probationary year will not be eligible to receive Title IV aid in the following year. Re-establishing Eligibility without an Appeal If a student is placed on SAP cancellation status and no appeal is approved, then he/she will not r eceive Title IV aid. The student may regain eligibility when the student has successfully been promoted to the next level by the SEPC. If a student takes a leave of absence or withdraws and then returns to UCF College of Medicine, the student's SAP statu s will remain the same as when s/he left UCF. If the status is good or probationary, then the student can receive Title IV aid. Standards of Progress for Veteran Students -M.D. Program For those students that receive educational assistance benefits to Veterans and other eligible persons, the law requires that schools have and enforce standards of progress. More information may be found at www.gibi ll.va.gov . 1. Unsatisfactory Performance Unsatisfactory performance may be subject to probation or dismissal from the College of Medicine. 2. Academic Probation Students may be subject to probation or dismissal from the College of Medicine if they do not me et satisfactory academic progress requirements. The decision for academic probation or dismissal is made by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. 3. Dismissal (Veteran Benefits) Benefits may be terminated for VA students who are dismissed from the College of Medicine . Academic Policies Honor Council (a.k.a. Student Professional Conduct Council ) Students are subject to the rules and regulations of the UCF College of Medicine's Student Handbook . The Honor Council (a.k.a. Student Professional Conduct Council ) has as its duties the consideration of students where suitability for the practice of medicine needs to be evaluated . In granting the M .D. degree, the faculty of the c ollege endorses each student as being suitable for the practice of medicine . Students, where their suitability for practice is questioned due to behavioral, 38 ethical, or other re asons, will be reviewed by the c ouncil . The council realizes that some behaviors may call for accommodation as a disability . Grading Policy See page 32 of this Bulletin for detailed information on the grade system. Medical Student Advancement More detailed information on medical student adv ancement can be found under the \"Advancement of Students\" section in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Advancement Process The Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee ( SEPC ) regularly review s the academic and clinical performance of each medical student . Students are reviewed at each meeting of the c ommittee . Students who are experiencing academic difficulty may be referred to the Director of Student Academic Support Services. The student's fa culty advisor may also be notified. The SEPC uses the following process for evaluation and advancement: I. The SEPC shall review the academic and clinical performance of each medical student a nd make recommendations regarding advancement, graduation, probatio n, dismissal, remediation, leaves of absence, and re -admission. II. The committee will review the performance of students in academic difficulty, those students demonstrating a potential for being in academic difficulty, and those students who have exhibited unprofessional behavior or non -compliance with other standards of performance . The committee may recommend an improvement plan, may develop more comprehensive longer - term remedial plans for those students having difficulty, or implement appropriate discipl inary action, possibly including dismissal from the educational program. III. The committee will recognize the achievements of those students displaying exceptional or outstanding performance. IV. The committee chair will notify each student of the committee's re commendation regarding advancement or disciplinary action and provide the student with an opportunity to appeal that recommendation if they desire. V. The Dean makes the final decision regarding an appropriate course of action for each student. Further information on the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) may be found in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Annual Evaluation Each student is reviewed annually by the SEPC to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next leve l of medical study . 39 Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation. Students with one or more C grades or annotation of T instead of assignment of final grade are reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate follow -up or action which could include no additional requirements, completion of a particular course or examination, repeating a particular module or clerkship, re peating a complete year, dismiss al from the program , or other recommendations . The student may also be placed in a probationary status until required actions are completed . Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee t o determine their suitability for continuing in the medical education program . The committee may recommend remedial action requiring the student to retake a module /clerkship or repeat a year , or may recommend dismissal from the program. Appeal of Advanceme nt Recommendation A student may appeal the advancement recommendation by the SEPC if the student feels that that the recommendation was not made in accordance with the advancement policy specified for the program or other requirements of continued enrollme nt or professionalism . The student may be advised by the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar regarding official policies.
