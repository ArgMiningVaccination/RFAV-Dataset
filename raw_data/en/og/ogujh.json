{"title": "Type 2 Salter-Harris Physeal Injury of the Proximal Phalanx of Great Toe: A Case Report and Review of Literature", "author": "Vivek Tiwari; Samir Dwidmuthe; Samrat S Sahoo", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Fractures involving the physes are peculiar to the pediatric age group with growing bones. These injuries, if not managed with due precaution, can lead to complications like physeal arrest and the development of deformity. Such injuries are much more common in the upper limbs as compared to the lower limbs. Physeal injuries involving the small bones of the foot are extremely rare. To date, no case of Salter-Harris type 2 physeal injury involving proximal phalanx of the great toe has been reported in the English literature. We report the first such case of a 10-year-old child who sustained a Salter-Harris type 2 physeal injury of the right great toe proximal phalanx. The fracture was managed conservatively with splintage of the great toe, and the child had good outcome at one year without any adverse sequelae.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2021-07-08", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
