Whether it's to wake up and get going on a working day or to relax during a weekend, many of us say, \"my day isn't complete without it\". Do you rely only on your first cup of [coffee](/topic/coffee)in the morning or rush to office and grab another before starting anything? If you say you cannot do without the second cup, then you could be in trouble. Coffee is filled with antioxidants and its beneficial nutrients can improve health. That is, a reasonable amount can provide some health benefits, and including that in your diet can make you feel alert and help boost productivity. But, if consumed in excess, [caffeine](/topic/caffeine)consumption could hurt your health, says Dr Arun Oommen, consultant neurosurgeon at [VPS Lakeshore Global Lifecare](/topic/vps-lakeshore-global-lifecare)in Kochi. Caffeine can be found in many products such as tea, soft drinks, energy drinks and in some medications, but coffee is considered to be the leading source of the stimulant. Caffeine in coffee can improve various aspects of brain function, such as memory , mood, vigilance and general cognitive function.Coffee also boasts of other health benefits such as its role in burning fat and as an anti-depressant as well as its protective effect against type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and liver and colorectal cancer, Dr Oommen says. It can also help reduce the risk of developing alcoholic cirrhosis and gout, says Dr Anupama N, consultant, preventive medicine, at Sakra World Hospital in Bengaluru.\"Nearly 90% of adults across the world consume beverages that contain caffeine on a daily basis.Caffeine can have some good and some bad effects on health. But there are not enough studies to support it in India. However, excessive consumption may demonstrate physical symptoms in people and it varies according to certain factors such as age, sex, medicines and environmental factors,\" she adds. \"Consumption of coffee decreases sleep as it increases cognition, alertness and improves efficiency . Coffee also boosts physical performance, reduces the risk of cancer, helps in losing weight, helps one stay focused and reduces the level of pain one has after working all day long,\" says Dr KV Harish, consultant, general medicine, at Bengaluru's [Apollo Clinic](/topic/apollo-clinic). But you also have to realise that caffeine is the most common moodchanging drug in the world. So, how much coffee or tea can one drink? Anupama has the answer.\"Any caffeine intake of more than 300-400 mg per day is considered excess intake. On an average, anyone who consumes four or more cups of coffee is considered a heavy coffee drinker,\" she says. Harish is of the opinion that an average healthy person can consume two-three cups of coffee every day . One must keep in mind that there are many other sources of caffeine besides coffee, such as tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate and certain medications. Hence, they must reduce the intake of these items too. Why is caffeine addictive? For decades, coffee has been considered one of the most popular beverages among people of all age groups. \"As caffeine is a psycho-stimulant, it has a high potential of addiction similar to tobacco and alcohol. Hence, there is a need to be aware of it and keep the intake within healthy limits,\" says Anupama. We run the risk of becoming addicted to caffeine if we consume coffee frequently . As we become physically dependent on caffeine, we may notice that the effects of caffeine are not as pronounced. This is because our body gets adjusted to having caffeine present in the system. We begin to need more of the drink in order to have the effect we used to experience. This increased tolerance to caffeine is the biggest sign of caffeine addiction, Oommen says. Apart from this, there's also a psychological relationship to coffee ad diction. Reena Yadav , proprietrix of healing and counselling centre It's a Deserving Life (IADLife), explains that \"the caffeine in beverages like coffee and tea blocks the nerves, thus keeping the mind and body from actually feeling what they are supposed to feel.\" \"Addiction is never because you love a thing so much. It's is a form of love a thing so much. It's is a form of distraction from the healing efforts.The chemical effect of caffeine, where it is responsible for the energy metabolism, makes the person feel energetic and active. Very soon the body gets used to the amount of caffeine that is being consumed and stops reacting to it. The person feels the need to increase the dosage of caffeine. Sometimes the consumption of caffeine increases more than it can be digested,\" Yadav says. Side effects of addiction Excessive consumption of coffee or caffeine can lead to dehydration, emotional weariness and exhaustion. Excess caffeine consumption can cause symptoms such as headache, anxiety , tremors, acidity , palpitations and lack of sleep. With long-term use, some may get anxiety and develop depression, Anupama says. But if one is suffering from headache, fatigue, anxiety , irritability, depressed mood and difficulty in concentrating, then the person is likely to be suffering from caffeine addiction. Caffeine addiction can also lead to early death. The symptoms of withdrawal can last up to one week for light caffeine consumers but continue up to two months for those who have been consuming around 1,000 mg every day , Harish says. The amount of caffeine found in tea is less than that in coffee, energy drinks or caffeine pills, but tea contains slightly more caffeine than most sodas. Green tea may contain less caffeine than black tea, Oommen says. Excessive caffeine consumption could also lead to high blood pressure, increased heart rate, indigestion and miscarriage, according to Harish. Beat the habit Cutting down on the amount of coffee or tea consumption slowly on a day-to-day basis will help deal quickly with caffeine addiction, says Anupama. Apart from this, one can decrease the brewing time of the coffee and tea, incorporate healthy diet and exercise, and ensure that you are not having medications with caffeine, she says. Harish suggests substituting coffee with green tea, as the sudden stoppage of caffeine can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms. Consume other milk-based drinks like buttermilk, yogurt, curds, ice cream, plain milk and milkshakes, he says, and adds that one should take a power nap when one feels tired or sleepy instead of consuming coffee. And those who are already at the peak of caffeine addiction, do not worry. \"To keep the mental and physical situation of the addict from worsening, it is advised that the person detoxifies and addresses the causative reason, with the help of counsellors or health experts. EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) or tapping has found to be most effective in this case,\" says Yadav. Even an employer has a distinctive part in discouraging employers from having excessive coffee. \"An employee can dilute the coffee with more milk and water to reduce the impact of caffeine on one's health. A company can choose to switch to a low-caffeine alternative,\" says Harish.
