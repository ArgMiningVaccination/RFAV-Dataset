While in medical school at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Cornblatt began identifying overlapping factors in cancer cases in his region that seemed to be overlooked, including physical environment, diet, and lifestyle. This sparked his commitment to asking the questions that healthcare professionals should ask their patients. This has led him to his current role as the Chief Medical Officer for BioHarvest Sciences and co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of International Nutrition Associates (INA). BioHarvest Sciences is the first and only fully validated industrial-scale plant cell technology platform for the production of plant metabolites. He joins us to talk about the challenge of sourcing raw, organic ingredients, why the first question you get asked when you take your pet to the vet is \"What do they eat?\" but why human doctors don't ask that, and more about the science and ethics behind BioHarvest Sciences. - [#BingingSober: A Blueprint For Living Well](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/bingingsober-a-blueprint-for-living-well/id744258884?i=1000598412027) #BingingSober: A Blueprint For Living Well I don't know about you, but my social media has been FILLED with programs and products promoting sobriety from drinking. Fresh off of Dry January, sobriety and the sober curious movement have been in the mainstream for months now, encouraging people to abstain from, or at least re-evaluate their relationships with alcohol. That idea is at the heart of our guest's mission. #BingingSober was started by Colleen Ryan-Hensley, a 10-year Navy Veteran. advocate for mental health and expert in mental toughness. Colleen struggled with depression since she was a teenager and instead of expressing her feelings and getting help, she was taught to \"rub some dirt on it and get back in the game\". To cope with depression, she started drinking and going on long runs to escape the things that hurt. When she joined the Navy, she brought this mental and physical toughness with her. Sure, it was the perfect combo for being a great sailor, but not so great for relationships, health and overall well-being. It wasn't until well after her Navy days that she started focusing more on the feelings she kept bottled up and peeling away the decades of toughness she had built up around her. Today, Colleen shows others how to avoid making these costly decisions and live a balanced life where escape and reality can live in harmony. - [All Things IGF-1](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/all-things-igf-1/id744258884?i=1000591992754) All Things IGF-1 Joining us today is a pioneer in Integrative Medicine, Medical Director at Sierra Integrative Medical Center and Nutronics Labs, Dr. Bruce Fong.
