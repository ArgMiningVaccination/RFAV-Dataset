While a one-time shot of turmeric-ginger juice is unlikely to make much of a difference, a diet that is consistently rich in the following foods can definitely support your immune function. Importantly, removing the major factors that weaken your immune system will often give you a huge leg up during cold and flu season. As you're traveling, celebrating holidays with friends and family, and running around for the holiday season, keep in mind the following things that will weaken your immune system: Alcohol Lack of sleep Stress Circadian rhythm changes (aka jetlag or staying up excessively late) When you're in a weakened state, you can become more susceptible to seasonal illnesses. Since those listed above are usually increased during the holidays (prime cold & flu season), we recommend increasing some foods and nutrients that can give your immune system a boost. We have limited evidence on how well individual foods will help you recover from sickness once you've picked up a bug (except garlic!), but we do know that there are several foods and nutrients that are key components of a well-oiled immune system. By following a whole foods diet most of the time, you're already ahead of the game. Add in the [10 nutrient dense foods](https://philly-im.com/blog/2022/10/30/got-micronutrients) we discussed last month, and you've really got your bases covered. And when your immune system is run down or you're at higher risk for illness, increase the following foods to prevent infection and shorten the duration of your illness! Garlic Garlic contains anti-inflammatory properties which support the immune system, and also contains allicin, which is a natural antimicrobial. Herbalists and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners have known this for thousands of years and turn to garlic at the first sign of cold or flu. You can gently crush the garlic and wait 10 minutes to activate the allicin, or turn your entire head of garlic into fermented garlic candy! [Fermented Garlic Candy](https://abraskitchen.com/natural-remedies-cold-and-flu/) by Abra Pappa Protein Protein is one of the key components that make up immunoglobulin compounds - which are one of the first defenses in your body's immune response. Other compounds that support secretory immunoglobulin A, which is a component of your gut's immune system include wild mushrooms, eggs with runny yolks (to preserve the choline), and vitamin C rich foods like raw red bell peppers, broccoli, strawberries, and citrus fruits. Try a [mushroom breakfast skillet with eggs](https://www.joyfulhealthyeats.com/spinach-mushroom-breakfast-skillet-with-eggs/)! Pumpkin Seeds & Sunflower Seeds There are a handful of nutrient superheroes when it comes to immune function, and these seeds happen to be great sources of one of them: zinc. Zinc impacts multiple cells that mediate immune response and a zinc deficiency hinders the development of T cells and B cells. Additionally, these seeds are also rich in magnesium, and we know that the level of magnesium in the blood is an important factor in the immune system's ability to tackle pathogens. Try toasted pumpkin & sunflower seeds to add to a soup or salad, or make [Spiced Pumpkin Seed Bites](https://www.frugalnutrition.com/spiced-flax-pumpkin-seed-bites-seed-cycling/). Polyphenols (berries, grapes, green tea, turmeric) Polyphenols are a class of phytonutrients found in foods. They have a direct impact on immune function, and can provide materials for the gut to maintain a healthy ecosystem and exert further immune-supportive benefits. Curcumin in turmeric, EGCG from green tea, resveratrol in grapes in certain berries (wild blueberries, cranberries, and lingonberries) all exhibit these positive impacts on the immune system.

Wild Salmon Wild salmon is one of the only foods that provides a reasonable amount of vitamin D, which is arguably the most important superhero nutrient when it comes to immune function. A 3.5-ounce serving of wild salmon contains somewhere between 400-900 IUs of vitamin D! (Which is up to 4x the amount found in farmed salmon.) Of course we always recommend supplementing in winter if you are further north than the 40\u00ba latitude mark, (which is the approximate latitude of Philadelphia, PA), but including wild salmon a little more often when you're at increased risk can give you an extra boost of vitamin D. Wild salmon is often mentioned in an integrative medicine approach, and so delicious.
