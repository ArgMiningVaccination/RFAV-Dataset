Gudbjartsson1,2, Unnur Thorsteinsdottir1,4, Ingileif Jonsdottir1,4& Kari Stefansson1,4 By the end of July 2021, the majority of th e Icelandic population had received vaccination against COVID-19. In mid -July a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, dominated by the Delta variant, spread through the population, followed by anOmicron wave in December. A booster vaccination campaign was initiated tocurb the spread of the virus. We estima te the risk of infection for different vaccine combinations us ing vaccination data from 276,028 persons and 963,557 qPCR tests for 277,687 persons . We measure anti-Spike-RBD antibody levels and ACE2-Spike binding inhibitory activity in 371 persons who receivedone of four recommended vaccination schedules with or without an mRNA vaccine booster. Overall, we nd different antibody levels and inhibitory activity in recommended vaccination schedules, re fle c t e di nt h eo b s e r v e dr i s k of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We observe an increased protection following mRNA boosters, against both Omicron an d Delta variant infections, although BNT162b2 boosters provide greater protection against Omicron than mRNA- 1273 boosters. Vaccines directed against SARS-CoV-2 have proven effective to reduce the risk of severe disease and transmission of the virus1-5. The four vaccines used in Iceland were the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (P zer-BioNTech), and AD26.COV2.S(Janssen). Front-line workers and residents of nursing homes were the rst to be vaccinated, starting at the end of 2020, followed by a nationwideeffort to vaccinate the entire adult population. The vast majority of thegeneral population had completed the primary series of vaccination bysummer 2021. Emerging data on side effects lead to a targeted use ofdifferent vaccines by age and sex with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 being pri-marily given to persons over 45 years of age 6. At the end of July 2021, with the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern (VOC) and a following rise in transmission, Israeliauthorities approved the administration of a third dose (booster) of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. This led to a 90% lower mortality frominfections among booster dose recipients than among those who received only a two dose vaccination 7-9. 54,438 Icelanders (22% of those eligible for vaccine at the time) received the recommended one dose of Ad26.COV2.S as their primaryvaccination. Due to a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections amongthose who received one dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, the Chief epi-demiologist of Iceland issued a recommendation of a booster dose ofmRNA vaccine to all Ad26.COV2.S vaccine recipients in early August2021, which has been shown to be effective in raising antibodylevels 10,11. Following this, booster vaccinations were recommended for the general public regardless of the vaccine they had initially received12.

Although vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 is reported to be lower against the Omicron variant,booster vaccinations have been shown to substantially elevate theneutralizing activity against the variant 14-18. Here we report on the effect of vaccination on serum anti-Spike- RBD antibody levels and their inhibitory activity in well-de ned groups of vaccine recipients matched for age and sex, with detailed informa-tion on vaccination status and COVID-19 diagnosis, following bothrecommended vaccination schedules for each of the four vaccines andadditional booster vaccinations. Finally, we use data on all vaccinations(n= 276,028 persons), all PCR tests ( n= 963,557 tests for n=2 7 7 , 6 8 7 persons) and persons diagnosed with COVID-19 ( n=3 1 , 9 1 9p e r s o n s )i n Iceland to estimate the effect of these vaccination schedules on the riskof being diagnosed with COVID-19. Results Antibody and ACE2-Spike binding inhibition levels in vitro Participants were recruited in July 2021 for measurements of antibodylevels and inhibition activity. Initially, four groups were drawn frompersons vaccinated with their last dose of the primary vaccine sche-dule in May 2021. The groups were de ned by the vaccine received, two doses of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, or mRNA-1273, and those whoreceived one dose of Ad26.COV2.S. Participants were invited to thestudy, drawn from a list generated at random, designed to have thesame age and sex distribution for each vaccine type. This resulted in441 invited persons, of which 196 participated (Table 1, Fig. 1), who gave a single sample two months after receiving their last dose. To analyze anti-Spike-RBD antibody levels we used recipients of BNT162b2-BNT162b2 as a reference, as it was the most commonly usedSARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Iceland (Fig. S1) 19. Ad26.COV2.S recipients had the lowest antibody levels (6.3\u00d7 lower than BNT162b2-BNT162b2recipients, 95% CI: 3.7 -10.4\u00d7), 0.6 -1.4\u00d7) and reci- pients of mRNA-1273-mRNA-1273 (6.0xhigher than BNT162b2-BNT162b2 recipients, 95% CI: 3.8 -9.3\u00d7) (Table 1, Fig. 1B). We did not observe a signi cant effect of age (95% CI: 0.74 -1.08\u00d7, w.r.t. females) on antibody levels. The Spike-RBD antibody levels and ACE2-Spike binding inhibition activity ( R=0 . 8 2 ) , a n d t h e v a c c i n e g r o u p s showed a similar separation for both measurements (Fig. 1B). Both Ad26.COV2.S and CI: 2.5 -4.3\u00d7). Effect of mRNA vaccine booste r on antibody and inhibition levels In August 2021, a decision was made to offer persons who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine. Tostudy the effect on antibody and inhibition levels we invited indivi-duals from a randomly generated list of those who had received asingle dose of Ad26.COV2.S 2 months prior. As these Ad.26.COV2.Sinvitees had a different age distribution from the group recruited forthe comparison of primary vaccine schedules, we generated a separatereference group of BNT162b2 recipients who had also received theirsecond dose 2 months prior. In the random generation of these two lists the age and sex distributions were made to be identical. This resulted in 573 invited persons and 106 participants who had receivedAd26.COV2.S and 59 participants who received BNT162b2 as a primaryvaccine (Table 1,F i g . 2). The Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees gave a sample prior to receiving a booster dose and a follow-up sample2m o n t h sa f t e r . Of the 106 recruited persons, 99 participants gave their rst sample prior to or within 4 days after receiving the booster (Figs. S2,S3, Table 1), and donated a second sample 50 -70 days post-booster, 66 received mRNA-1273 and 33 BNT162b2 as a booster. We observedmarkedly lower antibody levels in the Ad26.COV2.S pre-booster group than the BNT162b2-BNT162b2 reference group (8.8\u00d7, 95% 7.0-11.1\u00d7), whereas, recipients of showed than the BNT162b2-BNT162b2 refer-ence (95% levels (95% CI: 1.9 -3.5\u00d7) (Fig. 3A, Table 1). It is noteworthy that the Ad26.COV2.S-mRNA-1273 group had higherantibody levels than the Ad26.COV2.S-BNT162b2 group (1.7\u00d7, 95% CI:1.4-2.2\u00d7). The mean increase in antibody was for Ad26.COV2.S with booster mRNA-1273 (95% CI: -34\u00d7) (Fig. 3B). Prior to receiving a booster, Ad26.COV2.S recipients showed 4.7- fold lower ACE2-Spike binding inhibition levels (95% CI: 3.8 -6.0\u00d7) (Fig. 3A, Table 1) than the BNT162b2-BNT162b2 reference group. Ad26.COV2.S-BNT162b2 recipients were indistinguishable from theBNT162b2-BNT162b2 reference group (95% CI: -1.36\u00d7), whereas the Ad26.COV2.S-mRNA-1273 showed 1.6-fold higher inhibition Table 1 | Overall demographi cs broken down by vaccines Vaccine Comparison of recommended vaccine schedules Comparison of mRNA booster 62 52 51 158 99 59 33 66 Female (%) 145 (73%) 26 (84%) 42 (68%) 35 (67%) 59.6 62.6 52.8 60.1 62.7 Vaccine schedule No of doses 1 2 2 2 -- - - - Time interval - 3 months 3 weeks 4 weeks -- - - - MeasurementsAntibody U/ml (SD)113 (108) 969 12.1 (14.3) 33.4 (25.8) 3.87 (2.06) 22.6 (22.3) 18.8 (11.5) 33.7 (20.5) Time from vaccination is measured from nal vaccination date to the date of sample collection.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33076-4 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:5701 reference group (95% CI: -2\u00d7). The mean increase inhibition levels in and -4.0\u00d7, respectively) (Fig. 3C). Thus, the increase was 1.6-fold higher in booster recipients of mRNA-1273 than BNT162b2 (95% CI: 1.2 -2.4\u00d7). We neither observed a signi cant effect of age or sex on antibody CI: 0.98 nine addi-tional Spike variants, including Delta, followed a similar trend withAd26.COV2.S-mRNA-1273 eliciting the highest levels (Fig. S4 and Table S1). Age association of anti-Spik e-RBD antibody levels after vaccination We did not detect an effect of age on antibody levels following vac- cination, possibly due to a relatively narrow age distribution in eachgroup. Thus, we took advantage of the fact that we had recruited twoseparate reference groups that had both received their second dose ofBNT162b2 2 months before giving sample ( n=5 2a n d n=5 9 ) ,s p a n n i n g ages 22 to 68 years (Figs. 1,2,T a b l e 1). We observed that antibody levels decreased with age ( 24% per 10 years, 95% CI: 14 -32%), (Fig. S5) whereas sex and time from vaccination did not show an effect (95% CI: 0.8-1.55\u00d7 and 95% CI: 0.17 -1.47\u00d7 per month). Antibody waning following an mRNA booster dose Waning of antibody levels and prot ection following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been reported20-23. To study waning of anti- body and inhibition levels following a booster dose we recruited 17persons, out of 33 invited, in the beginning of August 2021, who hadreceived two doses of ChAdOx1 and later recieved a booster dose ofmRNA-1273 (Table S2, Fig. 4A). The rst sample was taken prior to receiving the booster dose and participants were followed up withfrequent sampling over a period of 154 days. Antibody levels were substantially increased 2 months after the booster vaccination with mRNA-1273 (12\u00d7, 95% CI: 8.9 -17\u00d7) (Fig. 4B). We used measurements obtained 8 -154 days after booster to estimate the waning of antibody and inhibition levels and found it to corre-spond to a half-life of 51 (95% CI: 48 -55) 42 days (95% CI: 38 -46), respectively (Fig. 4B, C). We noticed that the waning was not consistent with a steady decay, suggesting a plateauing of the antibody levels ashas been suggested 24. We estimate the half-life of antibody levels to be 42 days (95% CI: 39 -45) for the rst 100 days, but 93 days (95% CI: 78-116) for the remaining time period. Effect of vaccination on the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis caused by Delta To study the protection of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infections we conducted a retrospective total population cohort study in Iceland. Weobtained data from the Vaccination Register (The Directorate ofHealth) and included all persons who had received at least one dose ofFig. 1 | Antibody and inhibition levels by primary vaccination series.

A schematic overview of the recruited groups.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33076-4 Nature Communications | 8 2022 ( n= 276,028). For each person we obtained information about all vaccinations, the date of each doseadministered and vaccine used, as well as age and sex (Table S3). Weincluded only individuals aged 18 -80 year old (Fig. 5). We obtained data from the Register of Communicable Diseases (The Directorate ofHealth) on all PCR tests conducted in Iceland from January 30, 2020 to January 8, 2022 ( n=9 6 3 , 5 5 7t e s t sf o r n=2 7 7 , 6 8 7p e r s o n s )t oe x c l u d e all persons with a prior infection. We restricted the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections to the per- iod of July 1 -November 22, 2021 (Fig. 5), when a high fraction of the adult population (87%) had received a full vaccination and a peak ininfections was dominated by the Delta VOC (Fig. S6). Figures S7, S8show the observed cumulative hazard of SARS-CoV-2 infection fordifferent vaccination schedules. The increase in hazard rates was notconstant due to varying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we adjusted for the covari-ates age, sex and time from vaccination prior to the start date and used BNT162b2-BNT162b2 as a reference group. The adjusted cumulative hazard rate is shown in Figs. 6, S8, where the risk is adjusted w.r.t. the effect of covariates. A single Ad26.COV2.S dosewas less effective than the group(Hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI: 2.0 -2.4), two doses ChAdOx1 also less effective (HR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.43 -1.70), whereas two doses of mRNA-1273 were more effective than the BNT162b2-BNT162b2reference group (HR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.71 -0.91) (Table dose of BNT162b2 offered Ad26.COV2.S vaccinees if mRNA- 1273 was given as a booster. Similarly, persons who received a third vaccine dose (booster), had a greater protection than the BNT162b2- BNT162b2, or and a BNT162b2 booster.Although the bulk of the primary vaccine series were adminis- tered by spring and summer 2021 (Fig. S9), it is possible that a part ofthe observed effect between different vaccines can be confounded bythe time since the last dose. To investigate this, we restricted ouranalysis to a sub-cohort of 120,318 persons who received the nal dose of the primary vaccine series from June 1 to July 15 (Table S4). The effect of each vaccine on the relative risk of infection remained the same as in the full cohort, suggesti ng that the observed effect is not driven by confounding of the time since the last dose. Effect of vaccination on the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis caused by Omicron To estimate the protection against infection by the newly emerged Omicron VOC we restricted our analysis to the period of December 1,2021 -January 8, 2022 (Fig. 5), when 90% of infections were caused by Omicron at the end of the period, with a concomitant increase ofmore than 1000 PCR-con rmed infections per day (Fig. S6). Sequencing of viral samples from infected individuals allowed us to estimate protection against both Delta and Omicron VOC, and usedthe 2xBNT162b2 as a reference group (Table 2). The absolute risk of infection was higher for the Omicron variant during this time period(Fig. S6B), and in order to compare the vaccine effectiveness, insteadof relative risk of infection, across the two variants would requireinformation from a large number of unvaccinated individuals, whichwas not available due to the high vaccination rate in Iceland. There-fore, the statistical models we t for the risk of infection of Delta or Omicron variants are not directly comparable, however, since thesame reference group is used for both analyses we can contrast thedifferences in relative risk between vaccine groups across the two variants. Using the same Cox proportional hazard model as before, we observed that one dose of BNT162b2 was 3.4-fold less effective againstthe Delta variant than the BNT162b2-BNT162b2 reference group (HR:3.4, 95% CI: 2.0 -5.6) whereas against Omicron it was on par with theFig. 3 | Effect of mRNA booster vaccination on antibody and inhibition levels.

Three doses of BNT162b2 provided a 0.31 than BNT162b2-BNT162b2. protection for BNT162b2-BNT162b2-mRNA-1273, as for BNT162b2-BNT162b2- BNT162b2, in for Delta). Two doses of mRNA-1273 provided a similar protection against Delta as the reference group (HR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8 -1.32), 1.4 -1.8). An mRNA- 1273 booster on top of two doses of the same vaccine, provided similarreduction of infections to that of BNT162b2-BNT162b2 for both var-iants (95% CI: 0.7 -1.2). In contrast, a BNT162b2 booster in the same group provided a 2-fold greater protection against Delta (HR: 0.51, 95% than To the differences in relative risk between mRNA-1273observed between Delta and Omicron during this period were drivenby differences in age or time from vaccination, we repeated the ana-lysis on a sub-cohort consisting of persons who received their seconddose of an mRNA vaccine from June 1 2021 to July 15 2021, aged 30 -50. In this sub-cohort we observed the same effect as using the full cohort(Table S5). Two doses of ChAdOx1 were inferior against Omicron Delta, or respectively, to BNT162b2-BNT162b2. A booster dose of BNT162b2 elicited a reduction in Omicron and Delta infections, as compared to the reference group, or 1.4-fold (HR: 0.7, -0.74), respectively. In contrast, a booster dose of mRNA-1273 provided a greater protection than two doses ofChAdOx1 alone, but it was not signi cantly different from theBNT162b2-BNT162b2 reference group (95% CI: 0.6 -1.7). One dose of ChAdOx1 followed by two doses of -0.75) than reference whereas protection against Delta was not sig-nicantly different (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.16 -1.28). A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S provided 3.1-fold lesser protection against the Delta variant (HR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.1 BNT162b2-BNT162b2. of BNT162b2, after Ad26.COV2.S, Delta). while a booster dose of mRNA-1273 elicited a comparablereduction of Delta infections 95% CI: 1.5 -1.8). Discussion Based on anti-Spike-RBD antibody levels 2 months after vaccination we were able to rank the four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administered inkeeping with recommended schedules, with one dose of Ad26.COV2.Seliciting the lowest levels and two doses of mRNA-1273 the highest,while two doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 could not be separated.We observed a good correlation between the levels of antibodies tar-geting the Spike-RBD and the activity of these antibodies as measuredby inhibition of ACE2-Spike binding. Despite this strong correlation,antibody levels alone could not distinguish between two dose ChA-dOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccine recipients, whereas they were clearlyseparated by inhibition levels, with BNT162b2 inducing greater inhi- bition. The difference between two doses of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 was also re flected in their difference in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Icelandic population. This demonstrates a bene t of measuring inhibitory activity of antibodies, in addition to their levels. Further-more, this ordering based on inhibitory activity is consistent with theirFig. 6 | Adjusted cumulative hazard rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

In light of waning immunity over time20-23, health authorities in many countries are recommending booster vaccinations12. The rela- tively low antibody levels and protective capacity in recipients of one dose of Ad26.COV2.S motivated us to investigate their levels followingan mRNA booster, due to the relatively high proportion of Icelandersthat received Ad26.COV2.S. All Ad26.COV2.S recipients who received abooster dose of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 showed not only arobust elevation in antibody and inhibition levels, but outperformedthe two dose BNT162b2 referenc e group with mRNA-1273 booster eliciting the greater effect. Moreover, our ndings are in agreement with a previous study on heterologous booster vaccination ofAd26.COV2.S recipients, where booster doses of both mRNA vaccineselicited a robust elevation of both S-speci c and neutralizing anti- bodies, in addition to increased Spike-speci c T-cell responses 11.W e were therefore interested to see if this translated into greater protec-tion against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, both combinations,Ad26.COV2.S-BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S-mRNA-1273, showedgreater protection than the two dose BNT162b2 reference againstSARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the relatively low protection by a singledose of Ad26.COV2.S, the protection elicited by Ad26.COV2.S-BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S-mRNA-1273 is striking. This seems to beconsistent with emerging data suggesting that a vaccination schedulesthat mix two vaccine types, adenoviral and mRNA, elicit a greaterimmune response than that with only one type 25,i n c l u d i n gb e t t e r T-cell immunity26,27. These data are in strong support of the booster strategy implemented in Iceland, where recipients of a single dose ofAd26.COV2.S were moved from having the highest risk of infection out of those following the recommended vaccine schedule, to havingamong the lowest risk. The complete nationwide data on vaccinations and qPCR diag- nosis allowed us to assess the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection byother booster vaccinations not included in our smaller recruitedgroups. We observed that an additional third dose of BNT162b2 greatlydecreased the risk of being infected in agreement with publisheddata 7,8,15. Similarly, recipients of two doses of ChAdOx1 who received an additional dose of BNT162b2 diverged from those who received two doses of BNT162b2, with more reduction of infections comparable tothree doses of BNT162b2. This constitutes a striking turn of events astwo doses of ChAdOx1 elicited lower protection than two doses ofBNT162b2. These data mirror the great increase in antibody and inhi-bition levels observed when recipients of two doses of ChAdOx1received a booster of mRNA-1273. The extremely rapid spread of the Omicron VOC and emerging data on vaccine effectiveness both support a lower protection thanagainst the Delta variant 16. Our data con rm that a booster approach is indeed effective in terms of reducing the risk of being infected by Omicron. While mRNA-1273 was effective against infection by Delta, our data support a much poorer performance against Omicron. Thiswas not only apparent for recipients of two doses of mRNA-1273,when they were boosted with either BNT16b2 or mRNA-1273, but alsofor those originally vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 or onedose of Ad26.COV2.S. Despite this, a booster dose of mRNA-1273provided a similarly increased protection to that of BNT162b2 againstboth the Delta and Omicron VOCs, in recipients of two doses ofBNT162b2. Importantly, both ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S retainedtheir relative ordering, providing far lesser protection against bothvariants than two doses of BNT162b2. It is therefore encouraging thata single dose of an mRNA vaccine elevates the protection against both VOCs at least up to the level of two doses of BNT162b2. It is clear though that additional booster doses will be needed for recipients ofAd26.COV2.S. It must be emphasized that although our data demonstrate a greater protection against Omicro n, following a booster vaccinationcompared to two doses of BNT162b2 that serves as a reference, we do not have data on the relative protection compared to those unvacci-nated. This comparison is however, less relevant for a country likeIceland where 91% of inhabitants 12 years or older have now been fully vaccinated. The observational nature of the population study presents limitations to consider. There is a confounding factor between age andtime of vaccination, namely the rst to receive vaccination were front- line workers and the elderly. Further, the vaccine received correlateswith age and sex. For the analyses of booster vaccinations the groupsizes differ, which is accounted for in the statistical analysis butselection bias could generate statistical artifacts. The key strength ofthis study is the complete nationwide coverage, in terms of the highfraction of the population vaccinated, the sheer number of PCR testsconducted and sequencing of viral isolates. The mixed vaccination approach in Iceland provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of various vaccination schedules and booster combinations within a single population. Our data clearlydemonstrate and con rm the major bene to fm R N Ab o o s t e rv a c c i - nations against SARS-CoV-2 infections, both against the Delta andOmicron VOCs, regardless of the vaccine type given in the primaryseries. We observe a great increase in antibody level and inhibitoryactivity, consistent with our estimates of the effectiveness of protec-tion against SARS-CoV-2 infections by mRNA booster vaccinations at apopulation level. Methods Exposures and outcomes in the total population cohort study We used vaccination status as exposure variable, where each vaccinecombination creates a separate group at each point in time. Personswho received a vaccine dose during the study period changed theirexposure in a time dependent manner. During the rst time period we dened the outcome as a positive PCR test, regardless of symptoms and severity. For the second time period, we used PCR and sequencingdata to classify positive tests into Delta or Omicron outcomes. Personswho received a positive test, that could not be classi ed, did not receive an outcome. Antibody measurement Pan-Ig antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD in serum #09289267190) Cobas linear range of the assay is 0.4-250 U/mL. Samples were measured undiluted and if the con- centration was higher than 250 U/mL, they were diluted 1:10, untilconcentration was in the linear range. Inhibition measurement Inhibition of ACE2 binding to the Spike serum samples wasmeasured a multiplexed immunoassay (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC #K15466U, #K15436U) as a surrogate for neutralizing capacity of antibodies in serum, which are known to correlate 28.T h em a n u - facturer 's protocol was followed. Samples were diluted 1:50 and 1:500. Following a 1 h incubation, Sulfo-tag labeled ACE2 was added andincubated for 1 h. Plates were read using a MESO\u00ae SECTOR S600Reader. SARS-CoV-2 Spike monoclonal neutralizing antibody was calibration curve. To calculate neutralizing antibodyconcentrations (in units/mL), signals were back tted to the calibration curve. Variant classi cation The viral genome of all positive samples were sequenced at deCODE genetics using Illumina or ONT technologies (Supplementary Meth-ods, Table S7). For the most recent infections, where sequencing wasnot yet available, we classi ed positive samples into Delta or Omicron based on S-gene target failure on the Taqman available.Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33076-4 Nature Communications | (2022) 13:5701 8Statistical analysis A linear model was used to calculate the effect of covariates on anti- body concentration or inhibition leve ls. For antibody concentrations, all values were transformed using the natural logarithm (ln) and for inhibition levels values were transformed using the ln of one plus. Correlation estimates between antibody concentration and inhibitionlevels were computed using Pearson correlation coef cient between transformed values. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the vaccine effectiveness w.r.t. a reference group as estimated usingthe hazard ratio. The effect of vaccine combinations are estimated witha time varying covariate to account for vaccinations that occur withinthe study window. Time from vaccination was taken as a covariate forthose persons vaccinated before the study window. We regressed sexand age as covariates and used a penalized splines curve to adjust for the effect of age. For any vaccine dose that occurred within the study window, a 14-day lag time was introduced to account for the time untila full effect is observed. The R statistical software, version 3.6.3 was used for all statistical analysis 29. The survival package (version 2.44) in R was used for all survival analysis30.C o n dence intervals reported were not corrected for multiple testing. Ethical approval The study was approved by the National Bioethics Committee of Ice-land (approval no. VSN-21-072), after review by the Icelandic Data Protection Authority (DPA). Participants who donated blood signed informed consent. The personal identities of participants wereencrypted using a third-party system approved and monitored bythe DPA. Data availability All sequences used in this analysis are available in the EuropeanNucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB44803 . Existing data on PCR status and vaccination status were obtained fromthe Register of Communicable Diseases and the Vaccination Registerfrom their custodian, the Directorate of Health ( https://www. landlaeknir.is/tolfraedi-og-rannsoknir/gagnasofn/ ), for the epidemio- logical part of the study and are not presented at individual-level dueto privacy requirements.
