Acupuncture, supplements, ayurveda, homeopathy, reiki. Name an alternative medicine, I've done it. And while some treatments mitigated pain, none--as promised--eradicated my condition. What finally helped? The correct, evidence-based medical treatment. I've spent THOUSANDS experimenting with potentially harmful therapies. Therapies that barely worked. Boy, do I wish I had read Dr. Paul Offit's Do You Believe in Magic earlier. I would've saved both money and a fuckload of heartbreak. Dr. Paul Offit has an extensive resume. He's a pediatric doctor specializing in vaccines, immunology and virology. He's a medical pioneer who is responsible for saving millions of lives. Translation: he knows of what he speaks. In Do You Believe in Magic, Dr. Offit creates an easily digestible read perfect for the medical layperson. He comprehensively evaluates various complementary and alternative treatments without condescension. If you worry that Dr. Offit will discredit or disparage your healing modality, never fear. While he uses science to disprove fanciful treatments, he places the onus on the \"doctor.\" Patients and parents are given their due respect. Dr. Offit never wholly rejects complementary medicine--as long as it isn't harmful. Offit's central thesis is that complementary and alternative medicine CAN be used in conjunction with evidence-based treatment, but should never be a replacement. Offit is trying to make patients informed consumers, rather than victims of modern snake oil salesmen. Summary: if you want sound, evidence-based medical advice, give this book a read.
