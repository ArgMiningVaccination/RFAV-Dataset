About a month after receiving the booster shot, study participants who got the omicron subvariant BA.4/BA.5-focused vaccine had \"similar neutralizing fourth monovalent mRNA vaccine.\" All variants and subvariants were tested. The evaluated Pfizer's and Moderna's tweaked boosters, which were [authorized](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/as-the-fall-and-winter-months-approach-health-officials-are-anticipating-omicron-targeting-booster-doses-will-help-stave-off-infection-and-severe-illness-it-s-going-to-be-really-really-important-for-people-to-get-this-updated-new-very-specific-covid-vaccine-because-i-think-it-s-going-to-help-a-lot-in-preventing-infections-and-i-think-it-is-going-to-help-in-keeping-people-out-of-the-hospital-white.html) Sept. 1. In recent weeks, the vaccine-makers have reported positive results showing their shots are safe and effective. The researchers, who are from New York's Columbia University and Ann Arbor's University of Michigan, concluded that follow-up studies are needed to determine whether \"antibody responses will deviate in time, including the impact of a second bivalent booster.\" More bivalent boosters could be on the horizon. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, MD, [said](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/white-house-expects-covid-19-shots-to-be-annual.html) in early September that COVID-19 vaccine jabs could become as regular as flu shots \u2014 but that could mean a universal vaccine, which is still in development, or a new modified vaccine every year.
