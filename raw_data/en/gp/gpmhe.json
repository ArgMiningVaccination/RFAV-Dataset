Meditation is a practice that connects our mind, body, and soul. It helps us to connect with our inner selves and discover the wisdom and tranquility that lies within us. Ayurveda describes meditation as a measure under Daivavyaprashaya Chikitsa. It is a practice of constant observation of our thoughts and our breath. In this state, we are truly aware of our surroundings and our inner self. It is a tool to help us discover our inner calm and experience deep relaxation. Contents [1 Types of meditation in Ayurveda](#Types_of_meditation_in_Ayurveda) [2 Consult An Ayurvedic Expert to get guidance on meditation](#Consult_An_Ayurvedic_Expert_to_get_guidance_on_meditation) Types of meditation in Ayurveda According to Ayurvedic philosophy, the entire cosmos is an interplay of the energies of the five great elements\u2014Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Vata, pitta, and Kapha (namely the doshas) are combinations and permutations of these five elements that manifest as patterns present in all creation. In the physical body, Vata is the subtle energy of movement, pitta the energy of digestion and metabolism curing problems like [diarrhea](https://trustayur.com/blog/natural-home-remedies/ayurvedic-remedies-for-diarrhoea/), and Kapha the energy that forms the body's structure providing benefits like [better eyesight](https://trustayur.com/blog/natural-home-remedies/ayurvedic-medicine-to-improve-eyesight/). Meditation is beneficial for all doshas (Vata, pitta, and Kapha). Here is a list of three meditation practices that can be done by anyone, each technique has particular qualities that are helpful for balancing a particular dosha. Explore the qualities of these three practices, and see which one feels right for you. Kapha: Walking Meditation During the spring season, excess Kapha can manifest as mental sluggishness, foggy thinking, lethargy, and lack of motivation. Ensuring good movement and circulation helps prevent the heavy, thick, damp qualities of Kapha from accumulating. Reduce excess Kapha by using meditation techniques that have opposite qualities: light, lively, and energizing. There are many benefits of meditation as it keeps the body moving while enhancing focus and mental clarity. Instructions for Walking Meditation - Allow 15-20 minutes for practice. - If it's cool outside, look for a quiet place to do an indoor walking meditation, like a long hallway or yoga studio before class\u2014you can even do laps around a room in your home. - Take off your shoes and socks, if possible, to more easily feel sensations in the feet. - Stand in Mountain pose. Pause to take a few breaths and notice how you're feeling. Set an intention for your walking meditation. - With natural breath and a downward gaze, begin walking slowly and rhythmically, either back and forth in a long line or in a circular path. As you walk, silently use these three phrases as you note each step: Lift, move, place. Anchor your mind's attention on the sole of each foot as you travel, noting the sensation as the foot lifts off the floor, moves through space, and is placed back down. - When you stop moving at the end of the meditation, pause to notice how you feel the benefits of meditation. Pitta: Meditation on the Breath Peace and quiet\u2014that's what you need when the hot, sharp qualities of pitta increase in the mind and body as a result of life stresses or excess heat. When excess pitta manifests as mental irritation, impatience, frustration, or anger, try meditation with cooling, spacious qualities. Meditation on the breath redirects the intense focus of the pitta to rest on the subtle anchor of the breath. Let go of the planning, organizing, and list-making activities that often consume pitta's attention, and make time for deep quiet to reset the mind to its tranquil state. Instructions for Meditation on the Breath - Find a comfortable seat where you won't be distracted or interrupted. Sit with the spine tall, resting your hands on your lap with the palms turned up. - Close your eyes. Soften the muscles in your face and jaw. - Anchor your mind's attention on the belly. Without controlling the breath, simply observe the natural movement and sensation of breath in the belly. - Continue for 10-20 minutes, or until you feel the benefits of meditation like calmness and a quiet mind. Vata: Mantra Meditation Establishing a comfortable rhythm is one of the most effective ways to soothe an overactive or jittery mind. When the light, subtle, mobile qualities of Vata dosha increase excessively due to travel, stress, cold temperatures, or unsettling changes, Vata often manifests as restlessness, worry, fear, or anxiety. The rhythmic repetition of the mantra can slow a racing mind and enhance focus. Mala beads are helpful for tracking mantra repetitions, as they have some weight, and that tangible anchor helps balance excess Vata. If you don't have mala beads, simply repeat the mantra for five to 15 minutes, or until you feel the benefits of meditation. Instructions for Mantra Meditation with Mala Beads - Choose a mantra that resonates with you\u2014a single word or phrase tends to work well. Use any language you like. You might want to try this mantra (actually Patanjali's second sutra): Yogash Chitta Vritti Nirodhah (\"Yoga ceases the of the mind\"). - Sitting comfortably, take the mala into your right hand, draping it over the middle, ring, and pinky fingers (relax the pointer finger\u2014it doesn't touch the mala). - Close your eyes and soften the facial muscles. - Use your thumb to move the mala beads, one bead at a time. Silently or in a whisper, repeat the mantra once for each bead, using a soothing rhythm. - Do this 108 times, or until your mind feels the benefits of meditation, like a focused and steady mind. To get the maximum benefits of meditation it is important to stay away from all the distractions while you are doing it. Put your phone on silent, find yourself a comfortable and quiet space, and make sure you are completely relaxed before starting.
