The three most recent reportson the envi-ronment, on development strategies, and onpovertyhave furnished an overview of the goalsand means of development. This year's report onhealth, like next year's on infrastructure, examinesin depth a single sector in which the impact ofpublic finance and public policy is of particularimportance.Countries at all levels of income have achievedgreat advances in health. Although an unaccepta-bly high proportion of children in the developingworldone in tendie before reaching age 5, thisnumber is less than half that of 1960. Declines inpoverty have allowed households to increase con-sumption of the food, clean water, and shelter nec-essary for good health. Rising educational levelshave meant that people are better able to applynew scientific knowledge to promote their ownand their families' health. Health systems havemet the demand for better health through an ex-panded supply of services that offer increasinglypotent interventions.Yet developing countries, and especially theirpoor, continue to suffer a heavy burden of disease,much of which can be inexpensively prevented orcured. (If the child mortality rate in developingcountries were reduced to the level that prevails inhigh-income countries, 11 million fewer childrenwould die each year.) Furthermore, increasingnumbers of developing countries are beginning toface the problems of rising health system costsnow experienced by high-income countries.This Report advocates a three-pronged ap-proach to government policies for improvinghealth in developing countries. First, governmentsneed to foster an economic environment that en:ables households to improve their own health.Growth policies (including, where necessary, eco-nomic adjustment policies) that ensure incomegains for the poor are essential. So, too, is ex-panded investment in schooling, particularly forgirls.Second, government spending on health shouldbe redirected to more cost-effective programs thatdo more to help the poor. Government spendingaccounts for half of the $168 billion annual expen-diture on health in developing countries. Toomuch of this sum goes to specialized care in ter-tiary facilities that provides little gain for themoney spent. Too little goes to low-cost, highlyeffective programs such as control and treatmentof infectious diseases and of malnutrition. Devel-oping countries as a group could reduce their bur-den of disease by 25 percentthe equivalent ofaverting more than 9 million infant deathsby re-directing to public health programs and essentialclinical services about half, on average, of the gov-ernment spending that now goes to services of lowcost-effectiveness.Third, governments need to promote greater di-versity and competition in the financing and deliv-ery of health services. Government financing ofpublic health and essential clinical services wouldleave the coverage of remaining clinical services toprivate finance, usually mediated through insur-ance, or to social insurance. Government regula-tion can strengthen private insurance markets byimproving incentives for wide coverage and forcost control. Even for publicly financed clinical ser-vices, governments can encourage competitionand private sector involvement in service supplyand can help improve the efficiency of the privatesector by generating and disseminating key infor-mation. The combination of these measures willimprove health outcomes and contain costs whileenhancing consumer satisfaction.Significant reforms in health policy are feasible,as experience in several developing countries hasshown. The donor community can assist by fi-nancing the transitional costs of change, especiallyin low-income countries. The reforms outlined inthis Report will translate into longer, healthier, andmore productive livesfor people around theworld, and especially for the more than 1 billionpoor.The World Health Organization (WHO) hasbeen a full partner with the World Bank at every 111step of the preparation of the Report. I would liketo record my appreciation to WHO and to its manystaff members at global and regional levels whofacilitated this partnership. The Report has bene-fited greatly from WHO's extensive technical ex-pertise. Starting from the Report's conception,WHO participated actively by providing data onvarious aspects of health development and sys-tematic input for many technical consultations.Perhaps WHO's most significant contribution wasin a jointly sponsored assessment of the globalburden of disease, which is a key element of theReport. I look forward to continued collaborationbetween the World Bank and WHO in the discus-sion and implementation of the messages in thisReport. The United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF), bilateral agencies, and other institu-tions also contributed their expertise, and the ivWorld Bank is grateful to them as well. Specificacknowledgments are provided elsewhere in theReport.Like its predecessors, World Development Report1993 includes the World Development Indicators,which offer selected social and economic statisticson 127 countries. The Report is a study by theBank's staff, and the judgments made herein donot necessarily reflect the views of the Board ofDirectors or of the governments they represent.).474Lewis T. PrestonPresidentThe World BankMay31, 1993 This Report has been prepared by a team led by Dean T. Jamison and comprising Jos\u00e9-Luis Bobadilla, Robert Hecht, Kenneth Hill, Philip Musgrove, Helen Saxenian, Jee-Peng Tan, and, part-time, Seth Berkley and Christopher J. L. Murray. Anthony R. Measham drafted and coordinated contributions from the Bank's Population, Health, and Nutrition Department. Valuable contributions and advicewere provided by Susan Cochrane, Thomas W. Merrick, W. Henry Mosley, Alexander Preker, LantPritchett, and Michael Walton. Extensive input to the Report from the World Health Organization wascoordinated through a Steering Committee chaired by Jean-Paul Jardel. An Advisory Committee chaired by Richard C. A. Feachem provided valuable guidance at all stages of the Report's prepara- tion. Members of these committees are listed in the Acknowledgments. Peter Cowley, Anna E.Maripuu, Barbara J. McKinney, Karima Saleh, and Abdo S. Yazbeck served as research associates, and interns Lecia A. Brown, Caroline J. Cook, Anna Godal, and Vito Luigi Tanzi assisted the team. The work was carried out under the general direction of Lawrence H. Summers and Nancy Birdsall. Many others inside and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the Bibliographical note). The Bank's International Economics Department contributed to the data appen- dix and was responsible for the World Development Indicators. The production staff of the Report included Ann Beasley, Stephanie Gerard, Jane Gould, Kenneth Hale, Jeffrey N. Lecksell, Nancy Levine, Hugh Nees, Kathy Rosen, and Walton Rosenquist. The support staff was headed by RhodaBlade-Charest and included Laitan Alli and Nyambura Kimani. Trinidad S. Angeles served as admin- istrative assistant. John Browning was the principal editor, and Rupert Pennant-Rea edited two chapters.Preparation of this Report was immensely, aided by contributions of the participants in a series of consultations and seminars; the subjects and the names of participants are listed in the Acknowledg-ments. The consultations could not have occurred without financial cooperation from the following organizations, whose assistance is warmly acknowledged: the Canadian International DevelopmentAssociation, the Danish International Development Agency, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Swiss Development Cooperation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Overseas Development Adminis- tration of the United Kingdom, and the Environmental Health Division and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases of the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund contributed to the preparation of the statistical appendices. Three academic institutionsthe Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Swiss Tropical Instituteprovided important support for the preparation of the Report.Contents Definitions and data notes xOverview1Health systems and their problems 3The roles of the government and of the market in health 5Government policies for achieving health for all 6Improving the economic environment for healthy households 7Investing in public health and essential clinical services 8Reforming health systems: promoting diversity and competition 11An agenda for action 131Health in developing countries: successes and challenges 17Why health matters17The record of success 21Measuring the burden of disease 25Challenges for the future 29Lessons from the past: explaining declines in mortality 34The potential for effective action 352Households and health37Household capacity: income and schooling 38Policies to strengthen household capacity 44What can be done?513 The roles of the government and the market in health 52Health expenditures and outcomes 53The rationales for government action 54Value for money in health 59Health policy and the performance of health systems 654Public health72Population-based health services 72Diet and nutrition75Fertility82Reducing abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs 86Environmental influences on health 90AIDS: a threat to development 99The essential public health package 1065Clinical services108Public and private finance of clinical services 108Selecting and financing the essential clinical package 112Insurance and finance of discretionary clinical services 119Delivery of clinical services 123Reorienting clinical services and beyond 132 V6Health inputs134Reallocating investments in facilities and equipment 134Addressing imbalances in human resources 139Improving the selection, acquisition, and use of drugs 144Generating information and strengthening research 1487 An agenda for action 156Health policy reform in developing countries 156International assistance for health 165Meeting the challenges of health policy reform 170Acknowledgments172Bibliographical note176Appendix A.

The probability of dying betweenbirth and age 5, expressed per 1,000 live births.The term under-five mortality is also used.Median age at death. The age below which half ofall deaths in a year occur. This measure is deter- mined both by the age distribution of the popula- tion and by the age pattern of mortality risks. It does not represent the average age at which anygroup of individuals will die, and it is not directlyrelated to life expectancy.Total fertility rate. The number of children thatwould be born to a woman if she were to live to theend of her childbearing years and bear children at each age in accordance with prevailing age-specificfertility rates.Externality. A spillover of benefits or losses fromone individual to another.Intervention (in health care). A specific activitymeant to reduce disease risks, treat illness, or palli-ate the consequences of disease and disability.Allocative efficiency. The extent of optimality indistribution of resources among a number of com- peting uses.Technical efficiency. The extent to which choiceand utilization of inputresources produce a spe-cific health output, intervention, or service at low- est cost.Cost-effectiveness (in health care). The net gain in health or reduction in disease burden from a health intervention in relation to the cost. Mea- sured in dollars per disability-adjusted life year (see next two entries).Global burden of disease (GBD). An indicator de- veloped for this Report in collaboration with theWorld Health Organization that quantifies the lossof healthy life from disease; measured in disabil-ity-adjusted life years.Disability-adjusted life year (DALY). A unit usedfor measuring both the global burden of diseaseand the effectiveness of health interventions, asindicated by reductions in the disease burden. It is xcalculated as the present value of the future yearsof disability-free life that are lost as the result of thepremature deaths or cases of disability occurring ina particular year. (See Box 1.3 and Appendix B forfurther details.)Population-based health services. Services, such as immunization, that are directed toward all mem- bers of a specific population subgroup.Tertiary care facility. A hospital or other facility that offers a specialized, highly technical level of health care for the population of a large region.Characteristics include specialized intensive care units, advanced diagnostic support services, and highly specialized personnel.Country groupsFor operational and analytical purposes the WorldBank's main criterion for classifying economies is gross national product (GNP) per capita. Everyeconomy is classified as low-income, middle-in-come (subdivided into lower-middle and upper- middle), or high-income. Other analytical groups, based on regions, exports, and levels of external debt, are also used.Because of changes in GNPper capita, the coun- try composition of each income group may change from one edition to the next. Once the classifica- tion is fixed for any edition, all the historical data presented are based on thesame country group-ing. The income-based country groupings used in this year's Report are defined as follows.Low-income economies are those with a GNP percapita of $635 or less in 1991.Middle-income economies are those with a GNPper capita of more than $635 but less than $7,911 in1991. A further division, at GNP per capita of $2,555 in 1991, is made between lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies.High-income economies are those with a GNPper capita of $7,911 or more in 1991.World comprisesalleconomies,including economies with sparse data and those with lessthan 1 million population; these are not shownseparately in the main tables but are presented inTable la in the technical notes to the World Devel-opment Indicators (WDI).Demographic regionsFor purposes of demographic and epidemiologicalanalysis, this year's Report (including its healthdata appendices but not the WDI) groups econ-omies into eight demographic regions, defined asfollows:Sub-SaharanAfrica comprisesallcountriessouth of the Sahara including Madagascar andSouth Africa but excluding Mauritius, Reunion,and Seychelles, which are in the Other Asia andislands group.IndiaChinaOther Asia and islands includes the low- andmiddle-income economies of Asia (excluding Indiaand China) and the islands of the Indian and Pa-cific oceans except Madagascar.Latin America and the Caribbean comprises allAmerican and Caribbean economies south of theUnited States, including Cuba.Middle Eastern crescent consists of the group ofeconomies extending across North Africa throughthe Middle East to the Asian republics of the for-mer Soviet Union and including Israel, Malta,Pakistan, and Turkey.Formerly socialist economies of Europe (FSE) in-cludes the European republics of the former SovietUnion and the formerly socialist economies ofEastern and Central Europe.Established market economies (EME) includes allthe countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) except Tur-key, as well as a number of small high-incomeeconomies in Europe.These eight regions fall into two broad demo-graphic groups. The first consists of the FSE andEME, where relatively uniform age distributionsare leading to older populations. The other six re-gions are referred to as demographically developing,in the sense that their age distributions are youn-ger but aging. The demographically developingeconomies correspond approximately to the low-and middle-income economies. Figure 1 of theOverview depicts these regional groups. TableA.10 of Appendix A lists all economies by demo-graphic region and indicates their mid-1990 popu-lation. Appendix tables A.3 through A.9 providedemographic and health data by economy withinthese regions for economies with populationsgreater than 3 million.The regional grouping of economies in the WDIdiffers from that used in the main text of this Re-port. Part 1 of the table \"Classification of econ-omies\" at the end of the WDI lists countries by theWDI's income and regional classifications.Low-income and middle-income economies aresometimes referred to as developing economies.The use of the term is convenient; it is not in-tended to imply that all economies in the group areexperiencing similar development or that othereconomies have reached a preferred or final stageof development. Classification by income does notnecessarily reflect development status. (In theWDI, high-income economies classified as devel-oping by the United Nations or regarded as devel-oping by their authorities are identified by thesymbol t) The use of the term \"countries\" to referto economies implies no judgment by the Bankabout the legal or other status of a territory.Analytical groupsFor some analytical purposes, other overlappingclassifications that are based predominantly on ex-ports or external debt are used, in addition to in-come or geographic groups. Listed below are theeconomies in these groups that have populationsof more than 1 million. Countries with sparse dataand those with less than 1 million population, al-though not shown separately, are included ingroup aggregates.Fuel exporters are countries for which exportsof petroleum and gas accounted for at least 50 per-cent of exports in the period 1987-89. They areAlgeria, Angola, Brunei, Congo, Gabort, IslamicRepublic of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Oman,Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, Turk-menistan, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.Severely indebted to \"Severely indebted\" in the WDI) aretwenty-one countries that are deemed to have en-countered severe debt-servicing difficulties. Theseare defined as countries in which, averaged over1989-91, either of two key ratios is above criticallevels: present value of debt to GNP (80 percent)or present value of debt to exports of goods and allservices (200 percent). The twenty-one countriesare Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Bolivia,Brazil, Bulgaria, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cuba, Ec-uador, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Mexico, Mongolia,Morocco, Panama, Peru, Poland, and Syrian ArabRepublic.In the WDI, OECD members, a subgroup ofhigh-income economies, comprises the membersof the OECD except for Greece, Portugal, and Tur- xikey, which are included among the middle-incomeeconomies. In the main text of the Report, theterm \"OECD countries\" includes all OECD mem-bers unless otherwise stated.Data notesBillion is 1,000 million.Trillion is 1,000 billion.Tons are metric tons, equal to 1,000 kilograms,or 2,204.6 pounds.Dollars are current U.S. dollars unless other-wise specified.Growth rates are based on constant price dataand, unless otherwise noted, have been computedwith the use of the least-squares method. See thetechnical notes to the WDI for details of thismethod.The symbol / in dates, as in \"1988/89,\" meansthat the period of time may be less than two yearsbut straddles two calendar years and refers to acrop year, a survey year, or a fiscal year.The symbol.. intables means not available.The symbol - in tables means not applicable.(In the WDI, a blank isused to mean notapplicable.)The number 0 or 0.0 in tables and figuresmeans zero or a quantity less than half the unitshown and not known more precisely.The cutoff date for all data in the WDI is April30, 1993.Historical data in this Report may differ fromthose in previous editions because of continuousupdating as better data become available, becauseof a change to a new base year for constant pricedata, or because of changes in country composi-tion of income and analytical groups.Economic and demographic terms are defined inthe technical notes to the WDI. xliAcronyms life yearDPTDiphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus Programme on against tuberculosis)EPI additional components: im-munization against hepatitis B and yel-low fever and, where appropriate, vi-tamin A and iodine supplementationGBDGlobal burden of and (Australia, Aus-tria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Fin-land,France,Germany,Greece,Iceland,Ireland,Italy,Japan,Lux-embourg, Netherlands, New Zealand,Norway,Portugal,Spain,Sweden,Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom,and United States)STDSexually Nations Children's FundUNPFUnited Nations Population FundWHOWorld Health OrganizationOverview Over the past forty years life expectancy has im-proved more than during the entire previous spanof human history. In 1950 life expectancy in devel-oping countries was forty years; by 1990 it hadincreased to sixty-three years. In 1950 twenty-eightof every 100 children died before their fifth birth-day; by 1990 the number had fallen to ten. Small-pox, which killed more than 5 million annually inthe early 1950s, has been eradicated entirely. Vac-cines have drastically reduced the occurrence ofmeasles and polio. Not only do these improve-ments translate into direct and significant gains inwell-being, but they also reduce the economic bur-den imposed by unhealthy workers and sick orabsent schoolchildren. These successes have comeabout in part because of growing incomes and in-creasing education around the globe and in partbecause of governments' efforts to expand healthservices, which, moreover, have been enriched bytechnological progress.Despite these remarkable improvements, enor-mous health problems remain. Absolute levels ofmortality in developing countries remain unac-ceptably high: child mortality rates are about tentimes higher than those in the established marketeconomies. If death rates among children in poorcountries were reduced to those prevailing in therich countries, 11 million fewer children would dieeach year. Almost half of these preventable deathsare a result of diarrheal and respiratory illness,exacerbated by malnutrition. In addition, everyyear 7 million adults die of conditions that could beinexpensively prevented or cured; tuberculosisalone causes 2 million of these deaths. About400,000 women die from the direct complicationsof pregnancy and childbirth. Maternal mortalityratios are, on average, thirty times as high in de-veloping countries as in high-income countries.Although health has improved even in the poor-est countries, the pace of progress has been un-even. In 1960 in Ghana and Indonesia about onechild in five died before reaching age 5a childmortality rate typical of many developing coun-tries. By 1990 Indonesia's rate had dropped toabout one-half the 1960 level, but Ghana's hadfallen only slightly. Table 1 provides a summary ofregional progress in mortality reduction between1975 and 1990. (Figure 1 illustrates the demo-graphic regions used in Table 1 and frequentlythroughout this Report.)In addition to premature mortality, a substantialportion of the burden of disease consists of disabil-ity, ranging from polio-related paralysis to blind-ness to the suffering brought about by severe psy-chosis. To measure the burden of disease, thisReport usesthedisability-adjustedlifeyear(DALY), a measure that combines healthy lifeyears lost because of premature mortality withthose lost as a result of disability.There is huge variation in per person loss ofDALYs across regions, mainly because of differ-ences in premature mortality; regional differencesin loss of DALYs as a result of disability are muchsmaller (Figure 2). The total loss of DALYs is re-ferred to as the global burden of disease.The world is facing serious new health chal-lenges. By 2000 the growing toll from acquired im-mune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in developingcountries could easily rise to more than 1.8 milliondeaths annually, erasing decades of hard-won re-ductions in mortality.

Rapid progress in reducingchild mortality and fertility rates will create newdemands on health care systems as the aging ofpopulations brings to the fore costly noncommuni-cable diseases of adults and the elderly. Tobacco-related deaths from heart disease and cancersalone are likely to double by the first decade of thenext century, to 2 million a year, and, if presentsmoking patterns continue, they will grow to morethan 12 million a year in developing countries inthe second quarter of the next century.Health systems and their problemsAlthough health services are only one factor in ex-plaining past successes, the importance of theirrole in the developing world is not in doubt. Publichealth measures brought about the eradication ofsmallpox and have been central to the reduction indeaths caused by vaccine-preventable childhooddiseases. Expanded and improved clinical care hassaved millions of lives from infectious diseases andinjuries. But there are also major problems withhealth systems that, if not resolved, will hamperprogress in reducing the burden of prematuremortality and disability and frustrate efforts to re-spond to new health challenges and emerging dis-ease threats.Misallocation. Public money is spent on healthinterventions of low cost-effectiveness, such assurgery for most cancers, at the same time thatcritical and highly cost-effective interventions,such as treatment of tuberculosis and sexually '7ie disease burden is highest in poor countries, but disability remains a problem in all regions. Figure 2 Burden of disease attributable to premature mortality and disability,by demographic region, 1990 [1111 Premature mortalityDisability DALYs lost per 1,000 population600 Europe some countries a single teaching hospi-tal can absorb 20 percent or more of the budget ofthe ministry of health, even though almost all cost-effective interventions are best delivered at lower-level facilities.Inequity. The poor lack access to basic healthservices and receive low-quality care. Governmentspending for health goes disproportionately to theaffluent in the form of free or below-cost care insophisticated public tertiary care hospitals andsubsidies to private and public insurance.Inefficiency. Much of the money spent onhealth is wasted: brand-name pharmaceuticals arepurchasedinsteadofgenericdrugs,healthworkers are badly deployed and supervised, andhospital beds are underutilized.Exploding costs. In some middle-income devel-oping countries health care expenditures are grow-ing much faster than income. Increasing numbersof general physicians and specialists, the availabil-ity of new medical technologies, and expandinghealth insurance linked to fee-for-service pay-ments together generate a rapidly growing de-mand for costly tests, procedures, and treatments.World health spendingand thus also the po-tential for misallocation, waste, and inequitabledistribution of resourcesis huge. For the worldas a whole in 1990, public and private expenditureon health services was about $1,700 billion, or 8percent of total world product. High-income coun-tries spent almost 90 percent of this amount, for anaverage of $1,500 per person. The United Statesalone consumed 41 percent of the global totalmore than 12 percent of its gross national product(GNP). Developing countries spent about $170 bil-lion, or 4 percent of their GNP, for an average of$41 per personless than one-thirtieth the amountspent by rich countries.In the low-income countries government hospitalsand clinics, which account for the greatest part ofthe modern medical care provided, are often ineffi-cient, suffering from highly centralized decision-making, wide fluctuations in budgetary alloca-tions, and poor motivation of facility managersand health care workers. Private providersSmainly religious nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) in Africa and private doctors and un-licensed practitioners in South Asiaare oftenmore technically efficient than the public sectorand offer a service that is perceived to be of higherquality, but they are not supported by governmentpolicies. In low-income countries the poor often 4lose out in health because public spending in thesector is heavily skewed toward high-cost hospitalservices that disproportionately benefit better-offurban groups. In Indonesia, despite concertedgovernment efforts in the 1980s to improve healthservices for the poor, government subsidies tohealth for the richest 10 percent of households in1990 were still almost three times the subsidiesgoing to the poorest 10 percent of Indonesians.Inmiddle-incomecountriesgovernmentsfre-quently subsidize insurance that protects only therelatively wealthya small, affluent minority inthe case of private insurance in South Africa andZimbabwe and, in Latin America, the larger indus-trial labor force covered by compulsory public in-surance (so-called social insurance). The bulk ofthe population, especially the poor, relies heavilyon out-of-pocket payments and on governmentservices that may be largely inaccessible to them.In Peru, for example, more than 60 percent of thepoor have to travel for more than an hour to obtainprimary health care, as compared with less than 3percent of the better-off. The quality of care is alsolow: drugs and equipment are in short supply;patient waiting times are long and medical consul-tations are short; and misdiagnoses and inap-propriate treatment are common.In the formerly socialist economies, where govern-ments have historically been responsible for boththe financing and the delivery of health care,health care is free in principle, and wide coverageof the population has been achieved. This has ledto greater apparent equity. But in reality, better-offconsumers make informal out-of-pocket paymentsto get better care: about 25 percent of health costsin Romania and 20 percent in Hungary, for exam-ple,areunder-the-table payments forphar-maceuticals and gratuities to health care providers.Inefficiency is also widespread because the gov-ernment-run health system is highly centralized,bureaucratic, and unresponsive to citizens. Gov-ernments have been slow to regulate workplacesafety and environmental pollution and havefailed to mount effective campaigns against un-healthy personal behaviorsespecially alcoholconsumption and cigarette smoking. In recentyears real government spending for health hasfallen dramatically in the course of the transition tomore market-oriented economies. The public sec-tor has suffered from serious shortages of drugsand equipment and a lack of skills to managechanging health institutions. The consequenceshave been declining staff morale and falling qual-ity of care.The roles of the government and of the marketin healthThree rationales for a major government role in thehealth sector should guide the reform of healthsystems.Many health-related services such as informa-tion and control of contagious disease are publicgoods. One person's use of health information doesnot leave less available for others to consume; oneperson cannot benefit from control of malaria-carrying mosquitoes while another person in thesame area is excluded. Because private marketsalone provide too little of the public goods crucialfor health, government involvement is necessaryto increase the supply of these goods. Other healthservices have large externalities: consumption byone individual affects others. Immunizing a childslows transmission of measles and other diseases,conferring a positive externality. Polluters anddrunk drivers create negative health externalities.Governments need to encourage behaviors thatcarry positive externalities and to discourage thosewith negative externalities.Provision of cost-effective health services tothe poor is an effective and socially acceptable ap-proach to poverty reduction. Most countries viewaccess to basic health care as a human right. Thisperspective is embodied in the goal, \"Health forAll by the Year 2000,\" of the conference held bythe World Health Organization (WHO) and theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) atAlma-Ata in 1978, which launched today's pri-mary health care movement. Private markets willnot give the poor adequate access to essential clini-cal services or the insurance often needed to payfor such services. Public finance of essential clini-cal care is thus justified to alleviate poverty. Suchpublic funding can take several forms: subsidies toprivate providers and NGOs that serve the poor;vouchers that the poor can take to a provider oftheir choice; and free or below-cost delivery ofpublic services to the poor.Government action may be needed to com-pensate for problems generated by uncertainty andinsurance market failure. The great uncertainties sur-rounding the probability of illness and the efficacyof care give rise both to strong demand for insur-ance and to shortcomings in the operation of pri-vate markets. One reason why markets may workpoorly is that variations in health risk create incen-tives for insurance companies to refuse to insurethe very people who most need health insurancethose who are already sick or are likely to becomeill. A second has to do with \"moral hazard\": in-surance reduces the incentives for individuals toavoid risk and expense by prudent behavior andcan create both incentives and opportunities fordoctors and hospitals to give patients more carethan they need. A third has to do with the asym-metry in information between provider and pa-tient concerning the outcomes of intervention;providers advise patients on choice of treatment,and when the providers' income is linked to thisadvice, excessive treatment can result. As a conse-quence of these last two considerations, in unregu-lated private markets costs escalate without appre-ciable health gains to the patient. Governmentshave an important role to play in regulating pri-vately provided health insurance, or in mandatingalternatives such as social insurance, in order toensure widespread coverage and hold down costs.If governments do intervene, they must do sointelligently, or they risk exacerbating the veryproblems they are trying to solve. When govern-ments become directly involved in the health sec-torby providing public health programs or fi-nancing essential clinical services for the poor-policymakers face difficult decisions concerningthe allocation of public resources. For any givenamount of total spending, taxpayers and, in somecountries, donors want to see maximum healthgain for the money spent. An important source ofguidance for achieving value for money in healthspending is a measure of the cost-effectiveness ofdifferent health interventions and medical pro-ceduresthat is, the ratio of costs to health bene-fits (DALYs gained).Until recently, little has been done to apply cost-effectiveness analysis to health. This is, in part,because it is difficult. Cost and effectiveness dataon health interventions are often weak. Costs varybetween countries and can rise or fall sharply as aservice is expanded. Some groups of interventionsare provided jointly, and their costs are shared.Nonetheless, cost-effectiveness analysis is alreadydemonstrating its usefulness as a tool for choosingamong possible health interventions in individualcountries and for addressing specific health prob-lems such as the spread of AIDS.Just because a particular intervention is cost-effective does not mean that public funds shouldbe spent on it. Households can buy health carewith their own money and, when well informed,may do this better than governments can do it forthem. But households also seek value for money,and governments, by making information aboutcost-effectiveness available, can often help im- 5Box 1Investing in health: key messages of this ReportThis Report proposes a three-pronged approach togovernment policies for improving health.Foster an t'iiz'iron;ne') f that ci uthles householdsto improve healthHousehold decisions shape health, but these decisionsare constrained by the income and education of house-hold members.

Box 1 summarizes the Report's three keymessages for government policy and notes the im- 6provements and a productive assetbetter healthtothe poor.Improve management of government health ser-vices through such measures as decentraliiation of ad-ministrative and budgetary authority and contractingout of services.Promote dwers,t and competitionGovernment finance of public health and of a nation-ally defined package of essential clinical services wouldleave the remaining clinical services to be financed pri-vately or by social insurance within the context of apolicy framework established by the government. Gov-ernments can promote diversity and competition inprovision of health services and insurance by adoptingpolicies that:Encourage social or private insurance (with regula-tory incentives for equitable access and cost contain-ment)forclinicalservicesoutsidetheessentialpackage.Encourage suppliers (both public and private) tocompete both to deliver clinical services and to provideinputs, such as drugs, to publicly and privately fi-nanced health services. Domestic suppliers should nothe protected from international competition.Generate and disseminate information on pro-vider performance, on essential equipment and drugs,on the costs and effectiveness of interventions, and onthe accreditation status of institutions and providers.Increased scientific knowledge has accounted for muchof the dramatic improvement in health that has oc-curred in this centuryby providing information thatforms the basis of household and government actionand by underpinning the development of preventive,curative, and diagnostic technologies. Investment incontinued scientific advance will amplify the effective-ness of each element of the three-pronged approachproposed in this Report. Because the fruits of sciencebenefit all countries, internationally collaborative ef-forts, of which there are several excellent examples,will often be the right way to proceed. portance of continued investment in scientific advance.Since overall economic growthparticularlypoverty-reducing growthand education are cen- tral to good health, governments need to pursuesound macroeconomic policies that emphasize re-duction of poverty. They also need to expand basicschooling, especially for girls, because the way in which households, particularly mothers, use in-formation and financial resources to shape theirdietary, fertility, health care, and other life-stylechoices has a powerful influence on the health ofhousehold members.Governments in developing countries shouldspend far lesson average, about 50 percent lessthan they now do on less cost-effective interven-tions and instead double or triple spending on ba-sic public health programs such as immunizationsand AIDS prevention and on essential clinical ser-vices. A minimum package of essential clinical ser-vices would include sick-child care, family plan-ning, prenatal and delivery care, and treatment fortuberculosis and STDs. Low-income countrieswould have to redirect current public spending forhealth and increase expenditures (by government,donors, and patients) to meet needs for publichealth and the minimum package of essential clini-cal services for their populations; less reallocationwould be needed in middle-income countries. Ter-tiary care and less cost-effective services will con-tinue, but public subsidies to them, if they mainlybenefit the wealthy, should be phased out during atransitional period.Because competition can improve quality anddrive down costs, governments should foster com-petition and diversity in the supply of health ser-vices and inputs, particularly drugs, supplies, andequipment. This could include, where feasible,private supply of health care services paid for bygovernments or social insurance. There is also con-siderable scope for improving the quality and effi-ciency of government health services through acombination ofdecentralization,performance-based incentives for managers and clinicians, andrelated training and development of managementsystems. Exposing the public sector to competitionwith private suppliers can help to spur such im-provements. Strong government regulation is alsocrucial, including regulation of privately deliveredhealth services to ensure safety and quality and ofprivate insurance to encourage universal access tocoverage and to discourage practicessuch as fee-for-service payment to providers reimbursed by athird-party\" insurerthat lead to overuse of ser-vices and escalation of costs.Improving the economic environmentfor healthy householdsAdvances in income and education have allowedhouseholds almost everywhere to improve theirhealth. In the 1980s, even in countries in whichaverage incomes fell, death rates of children underage 5 declined by almost 30 percent. But the childmortality rate fell more than twice as much inThe poor suffer far higher levels of mortality at allages than do the rich Figure 3 Infant and adult mortality in poorand nonpoor neighborhoods ofPorto 40 30 20 10 01,500 1,000 500 0Deaths per year per 100,000persons in age group2,000 Note: Poor neighborhoods were defined according tospecific criteria. They are, broadly, squatter settlementswith substandard housing and infrastructure.Source: Barcellos and others 1986. countries in which average incomes rose by morethan 1 percent a year. Economic policies conduciveto sustained growth are thus among the most im-portant measures governments can take to im-prove their citizens' health.Of these economic policies, increasing the in-come of those in poverty is the most efficacious forimproving health. The reason is that the poor aremost likely to spend additional income in waysthat enhance their health: improving their diet, ob-taining safe water, and upgrading sanitation andhousing. And the poor have the greatest remain-ing health needs, as Figure 3 illustrates for PortoAlegre, Brazil. Government policies that promoteequity and growth together will therefore be betterfor health than those that promote growth alone.In the 1980s many countries undertook macro-economic stabilization and adjustment programs 7InfantsMalesFemalesD PoorNonpoor8designed to deal with severe economic imbalancesand move the countries onto sustainable growthpaths. Such adjustment is clearly needed for long-run health gains. But during the transitional pe-riod, and especially in the earliest adjustment pro-grams, recession and cuts in public spendingslowed improvements in health. This effect wasless than originally feared, howeverin part be-cause earlier expenditures for improving healthand education had enduring effects. As a result ofthis experience, most countries' adjustment pro-grams today try to rationalize overall governmentspending while maintaining cost-effective expen-ditures in health and education. Despite these im-provements, much is still to be learned about moreefficient ways of carrying out stabilization and ad-justment programs while protecting the poor.Policies to expand schooling are also crucial forpromoting health. People who have had moreschooling seek and utilize health information moreeffectively than those with little or no schooling.This means that rapid expansion of educationalopportunitiesin part by setting a high minimumstandard of schooling (say, six full years) for allisa cost-effective way of improving health. Educa-tion of girls and women is particularly beneficial tohousehold health because it is largely women whobuy and prepare food, maintain a clean home, carefor children and the elderly, and initiate contactswith the health system. Beyond education, gov-ernment policies that support the rights and eco-nomic opportunities of women also contribute tooverall household well-being and better health.Investing in public healthand essential clinical servicesThe health gain per dollar spent varies enormouslyacross the range of interventions currently fi-nanced by governments. Redirecting resourcesfrom interventions that have high costs per DALYgained to those that cost little could dramaticallyreduce the burden of disease without increasingexpenditures. A limited package of public healthmeasures and essential clinical interventions is atop priority for government finance; some govern-ments may wish, after covering that minimum foreveryone, to define their national essential pack-age more broadly. Public healthGovernment action in many areas of public healthhas already had an important payoff. Immuniza-tions are currently saving an estimated 3 millionlives a year. Social marketing of condoms to pre-vent transmission of human immunodeficiency vi-rus (HIV) has proved highly successful in Uganda,Zaire, and elsewhere. Information on the risks ofsmoking, and taxes on both tobacco and alcohol,are changing behavior in some countriesal-though mostly, so far, in the richer countries.Governments need to expand these efforts andto move forward with other promising publichealth initiatives. Several activities stand out be-cause they are highly cost-effective: the cost ofgaining one DALY can be remarkably lowsome-times less than $25 and often between $50 and$150. Activities in this category include:ImmunizationsSchool-based health servicesInformation and selected services for familyplanning and nutritionPrograms to reduce tobacco and alcoholconsumptionRegulatory action, information, and limitedpublic investments to improve the householdenvironmentAIDS prevention.Intensified government support is required to extend the Expanded Programme on Immuniza-tion (EPI), which currently protects about 80 per- cent of the children in the developing worldagainst six major diseases at a cost of about $1.4billion a year. Expanding EPI coverage to 95 per-cent of all children would have a significant impacton children in poor households, who make up adisproportionately large share of those not yet reached by the EPI. Other vaccines, particularlythose for hepatitis B and yellow fever, could beadded to the six currently included in the EPI, as could vitamin A and iodine supplements. In mostdeveloping countries such an \"EPI Plus\" cluster ofinterventions in the first year of life would havethe highest cost-effectiveness of any health mea-sure available in the world today.A second high priority for governments shouldbe to provide inexpensive and highly efficaciousmedications to treat school-age children afflictedwith schistosomiasis, intestinal worm infections,and deficiencies. Treatment of theseconditions through distribution of medicationsand micronutrient supplements in schools wouldgreatly improve the health, school attendance, andlearning achievement of hundreds of millions ofchildren, at a cost of $1 to $2 per child per year. In addition totreatment,schoolchildren can betaught by their teachers or by radio about the hu-man body and about avoiding risks to healthforexample, from smoking or unsafe sex.Governments need to encourage healthier be-haviors on the part of individuals and householdsby providing information on the benefits of breast-feeding and on how to improve children's diets.Programs in Colombia, Indonesia, and elsewhereshow the potential for success. Information on thebenefits of family planning and on the availabilityof family planning services is also critical. Govern-ment dissemination of this information can take anumber of creative forms, as the effective use ofradio drama and folk theater in Kenya and Zim-babwe demonstrates.Measures to control the use of tobacco, alcohol,and other addictive substancesthrough informa-tion campaigns, taxes, bans on advertising, and,in certain cases, import controlscan help sub-stantially to reduce chronic lung disease, heart dis-ease, cancer, and injuries. Unless smoking behav-ior changes, three decades from now prematuredeaths caused by tobacco in the developing worldwill exceed the expected deaths from AIDS, tuber-culosis, and complications of childbirth combined.Governments must do more to promote ahealthier environment, especially for the poor,who face greatly increased health risks from poorsanitation, insufficient and unsafe water supplies,poor personal and food hygiene, inadequate gar-bage disposal, indoor air pollution, and crowdedand inferior housing. Collectively, these risks areassociated with nearly 30 percent of the global bur-den of disease. To help the poor improve theirhousehold environments, governments can pro-vide a regulatory and administrative frameworkwithin which efficient and accountable providers(often in the private sector) have an incentive tooffer households the services they want and arewilling to pay for, including water supply, sanita-tion, garbage collection, clean-burning stoves, andhousing. The government has a vital role in dis-seminating information about hygienic practices.It can also improve the use of public resources byeliminating widespread subsidies for water andsanitation that benefit the middle class. Govern-ment legislation and regulations to increase secu-rity of land tenure for the poor would encouragelow-income familiestoinvest more insafer,healthier housing.A special challenge for concerted public healthaction is to reduce the spread of AIDS. The AIDSepidemic has already become a dominant publichealth concern in many countries. Although HIV,the virus that causes AIDS, has only recently be-gun to spread through human populations, it hasso far caused 2 million deaths and infected about13 million individuals. Some parts of the develop-ing world are already heavily infected: in Sub-Saharan Africa an average of one in forty adultshas the virus, and in certain cities the rate is one inthree. In Thailand one adult in fifty is infected.More than 90 percent of the infected individualsare in their economically most productive years,ages 15-40. They will be developing AIDS anddying over the next decade. Projections of the fu-ture course of the epidemic are gloomy: conserva-tive estimates from WHO are that by 2000, 26 mil-lion individuals will be HIV-infected and 1.8million a year will die of AIDS. By destroying indi-viduals' immune systems, HIV will also vastlyworsen the spread of other diseases, especially tu-berculosis. In highly affected areas demand forAIDS treatment will overwhelm capacity for clini-cal treatment and cause a deterioration of care forother illnesses.What governments need to do is clear: interveneearly, before a major epidemic gets under way.Countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Ghana, andIndonesia share the preconditions for rapid trans-mission of HIVsubstantial numbers of pros-titutes and high rates of prevalence of other STDs,such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid, whichfacilitate the spread of the AIDS virus. Strong pub-lic action is required to reduce HIV transmission.Particularly important are efforts targeted to high-risk groups: information to promote change insexual behavior; distribution of condoms; andtreatment for other STDs. Early reduction in HIVtransmission by high-risk individuals is very cost-effective, but later in an AIDS epidemic the cost-effectiveness of interventions declines substan-tially. Current expenditures on AIDS preventionin developing countriestotaling less than $200million a yearare woefully inadequate. Five toten times this level of spending is needed to dealwith the emerging epidemic. Essential clinical servicesThe components of a package of essential clinicalservices of high cost-effectiveness will vary fromcountry to country, depending on local healthneeds and the level of income. At a minimum, thepackage should include five groups of interven-tions each of which addresses very large diseaseburdens. The five groups are:Services to ensure pregnancy-related (prena-tal,childbirth, and postpartum) care; strength- 9ened efforts could prevent most of the almost half-million maternal deaths that occur each year indeveloping countries.Family planning services; improved access tothese services could save as many as 850,000 chil-dren from dying every year and eliminate as manyas 100,000 of the maternal deaths that occurannually.Tuberculosis control, mainly through drugtherapy, to combat a disease that kills more than 2million people annually, making it the leadingcause of death among adults.Control of STDs, which account for more than250 million new cases of debilitating and some-times fatal illness each year.Care for the common serious illnesses ofyoung childrendiarrheal disease, acute respira-tory infection, measles, malaria, and acute malnu-tritionwhich account for nearly 7 million childdeaths annually.These clinical interventions are all highly cost-effectiveoften costing substantially less than $50per DALY gained.A minimal package of essential clinical serviceswould also include some treatment for minor in-fection and trauma and, for health problems thatcannot be fully resolved with existing resources,advice and alleviation of pain. The provision ofhospital-based emergency care other than the in-terventions mentioned above would depend onday-to-day capacity and availability of resources.This emergency care includes, for example, treat-ment of most fractures, as well as appendec-tomies. Depending on resource availability and so-cialvalues, some countries may define theiressentialclinical package toincludea much per capita capita = $2,500)Public healthEssential clinical services'Totalbroader range of interventions than this mini-mum. At modest increases in spending, relativelycost-effective measures for the treatment of somecommon noncommunicable conditions could beincluded. Examples are low-cost protocols fortreatment of heart disease using aspirin and anti-hypertensive drugs; treatment for cervical cancer;drug treatment of some psychoses; and removal ofcataracts.Many health services have such low cost-effec-tiveness that governments will need to considerexcluding them from the essential clinical package.In low-income countries these might include heartsurgery; treatment (other than pain relief) ofhighly fatal cancers of the lung, liver, and stom-ach; expensive drug therapies for HIV infection;and intensive care for severely premature babies.It is hard to justify using government funds forthese medical treatments at the same time thatmuch more cost-effective services which benefitmainly the poor are not adequately financed.Widespread adoption of an essential clinicalpackage would have a tremendous positive impacton the health of people in developing countries. If80 percent of the population were reached, 24 per-cent of the current burden of disease in low-income countries and 11 percent of that in middle-income countries could be averted (Table 2). Theestimated impact of implementing the minimumclinical services is more than twice that for thepublic health package outlined above; when com-bined with the public health package, the share ofcurrent illness that could be eliminated rises toperhaps 32 percent for low-income countries and15 percent for middle-income countries. This re-duction in disease is equivalent, in terms of DALYs Table 2 Estimated costs and health benefits of the minimum package of public health and essentialclinical services in low- and middle-income countries, 1990 a. The estimated costs and benefits are for a minimum essential package of clinical services, as defined in the text. Many countries may wish, ifthey have the resources, to define their essential clinical package more broadly.Source: World Bank calculations.4.21.2 0.9 capita as a percentage reduction in burdenper year)of income per capita of disease (percent)gained, to saving the lives of more than 9 millioninfants each year.Paying for the packageThe most sophisticated facility required to deliverthe minimum elements of the essential clinicalpackage is a district hospital. Providing services inlower-level facilities allows costs to be contained atmodest levels for minimal versions of the essentialclinical package. The cost is about $8 per personeach year in low-income countries and $15 inmiddle-income countries. The cost differences arethe result of distinct demographic structures, epi-demiological conditions, and labor costs in the twosettings. When the cost of the public health inter-ventions described above is added, total costs riseto $12 per capita in low-income countries and $22per capita in middle-income countries.Adoption of the package in all developing coun-tries would require a quadrupling of expenditureson public health, from $5 billion at present to $20billion a year, and an increase from about $20 bil-lion to $40 billion in spending on essential clinicalservices. In the poorest countries governmentstypically spend about $6 per person for health andtotal health expenditures are about $14 per person.There, paying for an essential package will requirea combination of increased expenditures by gov-ernments, donor agencies, and patients and somereorientationofcurrentpublicspending forhealth. In middle-income countries, where publicspending for health averages $62 per person, the$22 cost of the package is financially feasible if thepolitical commitment exists for shifting existing re-sources away from discretionary services withlower cost-effectiveness toward public health pro-grams and essential clinical care. These majorchanges cannot be made overnight, but it is impor-tant to start and complete them as swiftly as possi-ble, before interest groups and bureaucratic inertiaundermine reform.A critical question in designing an essential clini-cal package is the extent of government financing.Should governments pay for everyone, or only forthe poor? The main problem with universal gov-ernment financing is that it subsidizes the wealthy,who could afford to pay for their own service,and thus leaves fewer government resources forthe poor. A policy requiring those who can pay allor part of their own costs to do so may make senseon equity grounds, but it also has disadvantages.Often, the administrative costs of targeting arehigh, and exclusion of wealthy and middle-incomegroups can lead to erosion of political support forthe essential package and to decreased fundingand lower quality of care. Furthermore, problemsof cost escalation and access to insurance on thepart of high-risk groups can complicate private fi-nance. For these reasons, in most member coun-tries of the Organization for Economic Coopera-tion and Development (OECD), governmentsfinance (or mandate the financing of) comprehen-sively defined essential packages for virtually alltheir citizens.In low-income countries, where current publicspending for health is less than the cost of an es-sential package, some degree of targeting is inevi-table. If the wealthy are already opting out of gov-ernment-financed services because of the higherquality and convenience of privately financed ser-vices, targeting is fairly easy. Community-financ-ing schemes, whereby patients at local health cen-ters and pharmacies pay modest fees, are anotheroption that can help both to improve the quality ofcare and, when fees are retained and managed lo-cally, to sustain services. A large number of coun-tries in Africa have had some early success withcommunity financing as part of the Bamako Initia-tive led by UNICEF and WHO. Nonetheless, expe-rience to date suggests that introduction of userfees at levels that do not discourage the poor islikely to be more useful for improving technicalefficiency (for example, by facilitating drug sup-ply) than for raising substantial revenues on a na-tionwide basis.Reforming health systems: promoting diversityand competitionEnsuring basic public health services and essentialclinical care while the rest of the health systembecomes self-financedwill require substantialhealth system reforms and reallocations of publicspending. Only by reducing or eliminating spend-ing on discretionary clinical services can govern-ments concentrate on ensuring cost-effective clini-cal care for the poor. One way to do so is bycharging fees to affluent patients who use govern-ment hospitals and services. In Chile, Kenya,Lesotho, and other countries governments areincreasing user fees for the wealthy and for thosecovered by insurance and are strengthening thelegal and administrative systems for billing pa-tients and collecting revenues.Promoting self-financed insurance, thus elim-inating large and inequitable subsidies to the moreaffluent groups who are covered by insurance, 11would also help to free government funds for pub-lic health programs and essential clinical care. Sub-sidies in the form of tax relief for contributions toprivate insurance are equal to nearly a fifth of totalgovernment spending for health in South Africa.In Latin America subsidies to the social insurancesystems are widespread and include tax relief, di-rect transfers to cover the operating deficits of so-cial security health funds, and matching govern-ment funds for employee payroll contributions.Where these subsidies benefit only the better-off insociety, they need to be scaled back.Reforms entail shifting new government spend-ing for health away from specialized personnel,equipment, and facilities at the apex of health sys-tems and \"down the pyramid\" toward the broadbase of widely accessible care in community facili-ties and health centers. Very few cost-effective in-terventions depend on sophisticated hospitals andspecialized physiciansall the services containedin the minimum essential clinical package pro-posed in this Report can be provided by healthcenters and district hospitals. Yet specialized facili-ties everywhere absorb a large amount of publicresources, a problem that has frequently been ex-acerbated by donor investments in tertiary care fa-cilities. In the 1980s Papua New Guinea, to correctoverconcentration of resources on higher-level fa-cilities, limited public spending on hospitals to 40percent of the recurrent budget of the Ministry ofHealthwell below the level in most developingcountries.Governments need to use more effective policiesfor financing training (including use of nationalservice mechanisms) to help meet the need for pri-mary care providers, particularly nurses and mid-wives, and for public health, health policy, andmanagement personnel. At the same time, gov-ernments should limit or eliminate subsidies forspecialist training. Increased government supportfor health information systems and operations re-search would help to guide public policies forhealth. Estimates of the national burden of diseasealong the lines of the global burden of diseasemethodology used in this Report, and local infor-mation on the cost-effectiveness of different inter-ventions, would enable governments to establishhealth priorities.In every developing country decisive steps areneeded to correct the pervasive inefficiency of clin-ical health programs and facilities and especially ofgovernment services. Clinics and outreach pro-grams operate poorly because of shortages ofdrugs,transport, and maintenance. Hospitals 12keep patients longer than necessary and arepoorly organized and managed. Countries pay toomuch for drugs of low efficacy, and drugs and sup-plies are stolen or go to waste in government ware-houses and hospitals.In the short term, reforms in pharmaceutical us-age offer the greatest gains in efficiency. Govern-ments that have introduced competition in theprocurement of drugs have typically achieved sav-ings of 40 to 60 percent. Governments can alsodevelop national essential drug lists, consisting ofa limited number of inexpensive drugs that ad-dress the important health problems of the popu-lation. Many countries have such lists, but not alluse them to guide the selection and procurementof drugs for the public sector. New treatment pro-tocols and alternative uses of facilities can alsoraise efficiency. Outpatient surgery can replacesome procedures customarily performed on an in-patient basis, at considerable savings.In the long run, decentralization can help to in-crease efficiency when there is adequate capacityand accountability at lower levels of the nationalhealth system. Some countries, such as Botswanaand Ghana, have delegated a wide range of man-agement responsibilities to regional and district-level offices of the ministry of health; others,including Chile and Poland, have devolved au-thority and resources to local government agen-cies.Their experience provides evidence thatsuccessispossiblebut alsothat hasty andunplanned decentralization, sometimes purely inresponse to political pressures, can create newproblems.Greater reliance on the private sector to deliverclinical services, both those that are included by acountry in its essential package and those that arediscretionary, can help raise efficiency. The privatesector already serves a large and diverse clientelein developing countries and often delivers servicesof higher quality without the long lines and inade-quate supplies frequently found in government fa-cilities. In many countries private doctors andpharmacies face unnecessary legal and administra-tive barriers, and these need to be removed. Butthe tendency for profit-making providers to over-prescribe drugs,procedures,and diagnosticsneeds to be countered; encouraging the for-profitsector to move away from fee-for-service to pre-paid coverage (through, for example, encouraginghealth maintenance organizations) is one feasibleapproach.Governments couldalsosubsidizeprivatehealth care providers who deliver essential clinicalservices to the poor. This is already beginning tohappen and needs to go further. In many Africancountries, including Malawi, Uganda, and Zam-bia, governments subsidize the operating expendi-tures of church hospitals and clinics in rural areasand the training of their health personnel. In Ban-gladesh, Kenya, Thailand, and other countries..governments, with assistance from donors, aresupporting the work of traditional birth attendantsin safe pregnancy and delivery care and of tradi-tional healers in controlling infectious diseasessuch as malaria, diarrhea, and AIDS.Regulation is an essential element of govern-ment efforts to encourage private health care sup-pliers. In most countries, governments have animportant role to play in ensuring the quality ofprivate sector health carethrough accreditationof hospitals and laboratories, licensing of medicalschools and physicians, regulation of drugs, andreviews of medical practices. Some countries inwhich the government's ability to regulate is par-ticularly weak could explore self-regulation forhealth care providers, while building up govern-ment capacity. In Brazil experiments with self-regulation for local hospital associations and medi-cal ethics boards are now under way.Government regulation of insurance is equallyimportant. In some countries part of the popula-tion is denied insurance because of selection biasunder private voluntary insurance. In the UnitedStates millions of people with high health risksand thus high need for health insuranceare un-able to obtain affordable coverage. Some types ofinsurance schemes also seem to contribute topushing up health care costs; this is particularlytrue of third-party systems and of systems thatreimburse hospitals and physicians item by itemfor any and all services performed. In both theRepublic of Korea, which relies on universal socialinsurance, and the United States, which usesmostly private insurance, health care already ab-sorbs an unusually high share of GNPand costsare still rising. During the 1980s, for example,health expenditures in Korea increased from 3.7 toalmost 7 percent of GNP, in large part because ofexpansion of third-party insurance coverage com-bined with fee-for-service provider compensation.To eliminate selection bias and expand insur-ance coverage, governments can require insurersto pool risks across large numbers of people. Tocontrol costs, governments have a number of op-tions for limiting payments to health providers.One approach is to encourage prepayment of afixed amount for each person, as is now done inprivate health maintenance organizations and inthe British National Health Service. Another is forinsurers jointly to negotiate uniform fees with doc-tors and hospitals, as is done in Japan's social in-surance system and Zimbabwe's private medicalaid insurance system; or insurers themselves canset fixed payments for specified medical diag-noses, as in Brazil. Yet a third approach, which hasbeen tested on a limited scale in the United States,is \"managed competition.\" This scheme pursuesthe three objectives of cost-effective health spend-ing, universal insurance coverage, and cost con-tainment simultaneously through tightly regulatedcompetition among companies that provide a spe-cified package of health care for a fixed annual fee.Each of these approaches has proved workable,but each also has its limits and disadvantages.Therearenosimpleanswersforhealthpolicymakers.An agenda for actionAdoption of the main policy recommendations ofthis Report by developing country governmentswould enormously improve the health status oftheir people, especially poor households, andwould also help to control health care spending(Table 3). Millions of lives and billions of dollarscould be saved. Implementation of the publichealth and essential clinical care packages, pursuitof economic growth strategies that reduce poverty,and increased investment in schooling for girlswould have the largest payoffs in averting deathsand reducing disability. Scaling back public spend-ing for tertiary care facilities, specialist training,and clinical care with lower cost-effectivenesswould help to increase the effectiveness of healthspending. So would encouragement of competi-tion in delivery of health services and regulation ofinsurance and of provider payment systems.These recommendations will facilitate progresstoward the goal contained in the declaration fromthe historic 1978 Alma-Ata conference: \"The at-tainment of all peoples of the world by the year2000 of a level of health that will permit them tolead a socially and economically productive life.\"Continued momentum toward this goal was pro-vided by the 1990 World Summit for Children. Al-most 150 countries have now signed commitmentsto specific goals for their countries to improve thehealth of children and women (Box 2). These goalsinclude reduction of child mortality rates by one-third (or to 70 per 1,000 births, whichever wouldbe less) over the course of the decade of the 1990s, 13Table 3 Contribution of policy change to objectives for the health sector Government objectives and policies Foster an enabling environment for households to improve healthPursue economic growth policies that benefit the poorExpand investment in education, particularly for femalesPromote the rights and status of women through political andeconomic empowerment and legal protection against abuseImprove government investments in healthReduce government expenditures for tertiarycarefacilities, specialist training, and discretionary servicesFinance and ensure delivery of a public health package, includingAIDS preventionFinance and ensure delivery of essential clinical services, at least tothe poorImprove the management of public health servicesFacilitate involvement by the private sectorEncourage private finance and provision of insurance (withincentives to contain costs) for all discretionary clinical servicesEncourage private sector delivery of clinical services (includingthose that are publicly financed)Provide information on performance and cost N Very favorableD Favorable0 Somewhat favorableContribution to goals 0 No impact expectedU reduction of maternal mortality rates by half, erad-ication of polio, and major reductions in morbidityand mortality from several other diseases. Com-mitments to specific improvements in education,nutrition, water supply, and sanitation were alsomade. These commitments underscore the politi-cal potential of action agendas for improvinghealth.The relevance of the main recommendations ofthis Report varies from one setting to another. Inlow-income countries renewed emphasis on basicschooling for girls, strengthening of public healthprograms, and support for expanded public fi- 14nancing of essential clinical services should be atthe top of the policy agenda. In most middle-income countries these policies are still germane,but reducing public subsidies for insurance anddiscretionary care would also yield large benefitsand should therefore be a key element of policychange. In the formerly socialist economies thereare two particularly crucial policy areasimprov-ing the management of government health ser-vices and developing sustainable health-financingsystems that maintain universal coverage whileencouraging competition among cost-conscioussuppliers.Box 2The World Summit for ChildrenThe declaration and plan of action adopted at theWorld Summit for Children, held in New York in 1990,incorporate a politically salient agenda for health. Thesummit focused, in particular, on the needs of childrenand women hut was set in the broader context of hu-man and community goals. The seventy-one heads ofstate who attended and the seventy-seven more whosubsequently signed the declaration committed theircountries to developing national programs of action(NPAs) for achieving these goals. To date, abouteighty-five countries have drawn up NPAs, and an-other sixty are in the process of preparing them.NPAs typically cover, among other concerns, pri-mary health care, family planning, safe water, environ-mental sanitation, nutrition, and basic education. Be-cause of their concentration on the welfare of children,NPAs are able to transcend political differences. Theyoffer a means of mobilizing the whole of civil societyneighborhood and civic associations, religious groupsand professional bodies, businesses, voluntary agen-cies, organized labor, and universitiesin the cause ofinvestment for health.NPAs are being integrated into national develop-ment planning. They set forth measurable, attainablegoalsto be met by 2000 or earlierthat are adapted tothe realities of the country. By quantifying the re-sources required to achieve these goals, NPAs help toidentify the changes that are needed in national bud-gets and external aid if priorities for human develop-ment are to be met. The health goals of the summit'splan of action include:The eradication of polio by 2000The elimination of neonatal tetanus by 1995A 90 percent reduction in measles cases and a 95percent reduction in measles deathsAchievement (by 2000) and maintenance of at least90 percent immunization coverage of one-year-old chil-dren, as well as universal tetanus immunization forwomen of childbearing ageA halving of child deaths caused by diarrhea and aone-quarter reduction in the incidence of diarrhealdiseaseA reduction by one-third in child deaths caused byacute respiratory infectionsVirtual elimination of vitamin A deficiency and io-dine deficiency disordersA reduction in the incidence of low birth weight(2.5 kilograms or less) to no more than 10 percentA one-third reduction from 1990 levels in iron defi-ciency anemia among womenAccess for all women to prenatal care, trained at-tendants during childbirth, and referral for high-riskpregnancies and obstetric emergencies.The agenda for action of the children's health summitis broadly consistent with the messages of this Report. At first glance, it might appear that adoption ofthis Report's major recommendations will be easy.To reach most people living in the developingworld with the minimum package of cost-effectivepublic health and essential clinical services, abouthalf of current government expenditures on other,more discretionary care would have to be redi-rected. But in reality, change will be difficult, sincean array of interest groups may stand to losefrom suppliers of medical services to rich benefici-aries of public subsidies to protected drug com-panies. Many of the changes will take years to im-plement because they mean a major redirection ofpublic resources and require the development ofnew institutional capabilities.A number of developing countries have alreadyshown in recent years that broad reforms in thehealth sector are possible when there is sufficientpolitical will and when changes to the health sys-tem are designed and implemented by capableplanners and managers. Zimbabwe has imposed adecade-long moratorium on new investments incentral hospitals and has concentrated on improv-ing health centers and other district-level infra-structure. Tunisia has converted eleven large gov-ernment hospitals to semiautonomous institutionswith strong incentives for improved performance.During the 1980s Chile delegated responsibility forits entire primary clinical care system to local gov-ernments and fostered more public and privatecompetition in health service delivery and in in-surance. Costa Rica and Korea achieved universalhealth coverage through social insurance.The international community can do more tosupport health policy reforms. In 1990 donors dis-bursed about $4.8 billion of assistance for health,or about 2.5 percent of all health spending in de-veloping countries. The share of total develop-ment aid for health declined slightly in the 1980s,from 7 to 6 percent, despite widespread calls forincreased investment in human resource develop-ment, including health. As an immediate firststep, donors need to restore this share to its formerlevel. A more substantial increase can be easily 15justified, given the importance of health in reduc-ing poverty and the large gap between current andneeded spending for public health programs andminimum clinical services. An additional $2 billiona year from donors would meet about one-quarterof the costs of stabilizing the AIDS epidemic ($500million) and one-sixth of the extra resourcesneeded to provide the public health and clinicalcare package for low-income countries ($1.5 billionof the $10 billion required).Increased external assistance for health researchthat focuses on the major health problems of de-veloping countriessuch as the search for new an-timalarial drugs and new or improved vaccinescould have a very high payoff and would build onthe comparative advantage of donor countries inconducting scientific research. That most healthresearch benefits many countries further justifiesdonor support, particularly through such effectiveinternationally collaborative mechanisms as theSpecial Programme for Research and Training inTropical Diseases.Donors and developing country governmentscan also do much to improve the effectiveness ofaid for health. This is especially important in low-income Africa, where aid already accounts for anaverage 20 percent of health spendingand forover halfinBurundi,Chad,Guinea-Bissau,Mozambique, and Tanzania. Even in other devel-oping regions, where aid amounts to 2 percent orless of health expenditures, better targeting andmanagement of this assistance can catalyze policychange.Redirecting donor money from hospitals andspecialist training to public health programs and 16essential clinical careespecially for tuberculosiscontrol, the EPI Plus program, AIDS prevention,and reduction of tobacco consumptionwould bea significant contribution to policy reform. Sowould support for capacity-building. Countriesthat are willing to undertake major changes inhealth policy should be strong candidates for in-creased aid, including donor financing of recurrentcosts. An increasing number of donors, amongthem the World Bank, are now supporting thiskind of broad sectoral reform. Stronger donor co-ordination, especially at the level of individual de-veloping country clients, would improve the posi-tive impact of aid on health, as shown by theexperienceofBangladesh,Senegal,andZimbabwe.The benefits to the developing world fromadopting sound policies for health are enormous.There is great potential for change during theclosing years of this decade as more countries en-courage broad political participation and public ac-countability, as levels of education and knowledgeimprove, and as understanding of human biology,public health, and health care systems increases. Ifthe right policy choices are made, the payoff willbe high. The momentum of past reductions in theburden of infectious disease in developing coun-tries can be maintained and accelerated. The AIDSepidemic can be slowed or reversed. The emergingproblems of noncommunicable disease in agingpopulations can be managed without rapid in-creases in health expenditures. In the end, this willtranslate into longer, healthier, and more produc-tive lives for people around the world, especiallythe more than 1 billion now living in poverty.Health in developing countries:successes and challenges On October 22, 1977, Au Maow Maalin, a twenty-three-year-old cook living in the town of Merca,Somalia, developed a fever and rash that was sub-sequently diagnosed assmallpox. Vaccinationteams immediately descended on Merca andwithin three weeks had vaccinated more than50,000 people. They also began an intensive searchfor other cases in Merca and along the road andfootpaths leading to it. By December 29 the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) had removed Mercafrom its list of potential outbreaks of smallpox andhad initiated a two-year surveillance for the dis-ease throughout the Horn of Africa. It turned out,however, that Mr. Maalin had experienced theworld's last case of smallpox. He survived, andWHO's twelve-year-longIntensified SmallpoxEradication Programme was brought to a trium-phant end.In 1967, the year when the program began,somewhere between 1.5 million and 2 million peo-ple died from smallpox. Perhaps half a millionmore were blinded, and more than 10 million wereseriously and permanently disfigured. In the early1950s the toll from smallpox had been three or fourtimes greater. Then more and more countries un-dertook vaccination programs, and by the time theglobal program began, the disease had been vir-tually eradicated in 125 countries. Even so, the costof smallpox vaccination, quarantine programs,and treatment totaled more than $300 million in1968 alone. The eradication program, by contrast,cost $300 million over the whole of its twelve-yearlife and has therefore saved hundreds of millionsof dollars a year in direct, measurable costs, as wellas unquantifiable amounts of human suffering.Few investments of any kind generate humanand financial benefits on that scale. Yet in manyways the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Pro-gramme exemplifies the potential of today's medi-cine. Around the world, the past half century hasseen startling improvements in health. Progress indrugs, vaccines, epidemiological knowledge, andorganizational experience continually expands therange of options for tomorrow. Tools and methodsfor combating and eliminating much of the re-maining burden of disease are now affordable,even by the poorest countries. Good policy, how-ever, is essential for achieving good health. Somecountries have made full use of the potential ofmedicine; others have barely tapped it, despiteheavy spending. This Report draws from this var-ied experience lessons that will assist policymakersin realizing the enormous potential returns fromtheir countries' investments in health.Why health mattersGood health, as people know from their own ex-perience, is a crucial part of well-being, but spend-ing on health can also be justified on purely eco-nomic grounds. Improved health contributes toeconomic growth in four ways: it reduces produc-tion losses caused by worker illness; it permits theuse of natural resources that had been totally ornearly inaccessible because of disease; it increasesthe enrollment of children in school and makesthem better able to learn; and it frees for alterna-tive uses resources that would otherwise have tobe spent on treating illness. The economic gainsare relatively greater for poor people, who are typ- 17ically most handicapped by ill health and whostand to gain the most from the development ofunderutilized natural resources.Gains in worker productivityThe most obvious sources of gain are fewer workdays lost to illness, increased productivity, greateropportunities to obtain better-paying jobs, andlonger working lives. To take a classic example,leprosy is a disease that affects people in the primeof life, with peak incidence rates among youngadults. As many as 30 percent of those affectedmay be seriously deformed, and their workinglives will be shortened as well. A study of lepers inurban Tamil Nadu, India, estimates that the elim-ination of deformity would more than triple theexpected annual earnings of those with jobs. Theprevention of deformity in all of India's 645,000lepers would have added an estimated $130 mil-lion to the country's 1985 GNP. This amount is theequivalent of almost 10 percent of all the officialdevelopment assistance received by India in 1985.Yet leprosy accounted for only a small proportionof the country's disease burden, less than 1 per-cent in 1990.Healthier workers earn more because (as re-search in Bangladesh has demonstrated) they aremore productive and can get better-paying jobs. InC\u00f4te d'Ivoire daily wage rates are estimated to be19 percent lower, on average, among men who arelikely to lose a day of work per month because ofillness than among healthier men.When illness strikes, an individual's lost outputand earnings often go undetected in economic sta-tistics because they are borne by the household. Inmany developing countries unemployment (ordisability) insurance is rare, and healthier mem-bers of the household work harder or longer tomake up for the loss in income. In a sample of 250Sudanese households, each of which lost, on aver-age, forty working hours per year because of ma-laria alone, this extra work made up for 68 percentof the lost agricultural labor. Similar findings havecome from research in Paraguay and Colombia.In the long run, the benefits of improved healthare also likely to influence the way work is orga-nized and carried out. With a healthy work force,employers can reduce the costs of building slackinto their production schedules, invest more instaff training, and exploit the benefits of specializa-tion. Similar gains are likely among farmers, whooften hedge against sickness by being risk-averse;they forgo higher output in return for less van- 18ability in their income. In Paraguay, for example,farmers in malarious areas choose to grow crops that are of lower value but that can be workedoutside the malaria season. Improved utilization of natural resourcesSome health investments raise the productivity ofland. In Sri Lanka the near-eradication of malariaduring 1947-77 is estimated to have raised nationalincome by 9 percent in 1977. The cumulative costwas $52 million, compared with a cumulative gainin national income over the thirty-one years of $7.6billion, implying a spectacular benefit-cost ratio ofmore than 140. Areas previously blighted by mos-quitoes became attractive for settlement; migrantsmoved in, and output increased. In Uganda mas-sive migration to fertile but underexploited landfollowed the partial control of river blindness (on-chocerciasis) in the 1950s. The OnchocerciasisControl Programme, conducted in eleven coun-tries of the Sahel, is a more recent example of thesame benefits (see Box 1.1).Benefits in the next generation through educationThere is no question that schooling pays off inhigher incomes. Four years of primary educationboosts farmers' annual productivity by 9 percenton average, and workers who do better at schoolearn more. Studies in Ghana, Kenya, Pakistan,and Tanzania indicate that workers who scored 10percent above the sample mean on various cogni-tive tests have a wage advantage ranging from 13to 22 percent; in Nepal farmers with better mathe-matical skills are more likely to adopt profitablenew crops.Poor health and nutrition reduce the gains ofschooling in three areas: enrollment, ability tolearn, and participation by girls. Children who en-joy better health and nutrition during early child-hood are more ready for school and more likely toenroll. A study in Nepal has found that the proba-bility of attending school is only 5 percent for nu-tritionally stunted children, compared with 27 per-cent for those at the norm.Health and nutrition problems affect a child'sability to learn. Nutritional deficiencies in earlychildhood can lead to lasting problems: iron defi-ciency anemia reduces cognitive function, iodinedeficiency causes irreversible mental retardation,and vitamin A deficiency is the primary cause ofblindness among children. Older children are sub-ject to other kinds of disease. In a recent study inBox 1.1Controlling river blindnessOnchocerciasis, or river blindness as it is more com-monly known, is caused by a parasitic worm whichproduces millions of larvae that move through thebody, causing intense itching, debilitation, and eventu-ally blindness. The disease is spread by a small, fiercelybiting blackfly that transmits the larvae from infected touninfected people.The goals of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme(OCP), set up in 1974 and covering eleven Saheliancountries, are to control the blackfly by destroying itslarvae with insecticides sprayed from the air. The envi-ronmental impact of the insecticides is continuouslymonitored by an independent ecological committee, incooperation with the national governments. The com-mittee has full authority to screen insecticides and toapprove or reject their use. The program has also col-laborated with the pharmaceutical industry to developfor human use a drug, ivermectin, that safely and effec-tively kills the larvae in the body. Ivermectin, however,has little impact on the adult worm and so must besupplemented with vector control by aerial spraying.The producer of ivermectin, Merck & Co., has commit-ted itself to provide the drug free of charge as long as itis needed to combat river blindness.The OCP's four sponsoring agenciesthe Food andAgriculture Organization, the United Nations Devel-opment Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, andWHOthrough a steering committee chaired by theWorld Bank, make broad policy decisions and overseeoperations. WHO has executive responsibility througha team of entomologists, epidemiologists, field staff,and pilots; 97 percent of the staff are nationals of theparticipating countries. The World Bank organizes thefinances and manages them through a trust fund. Italso supports socioeconomic development in the areasaffected by the disease.The program is widely regarded as a great success. Itprotects from river blindness about 30 million people,including more than 9 million children born since theOCP began, at an annual cost of less than $1 per per-son. More than 1.5 million people who were once seri-ously infected have completely recovered. It is esti-mated that the program will have prevented at least500,000 cases of blindness by the time it is wound uparound the end of the century. And it is already freeingapproximately25millionhectaresofpreviouslyblighted land for resettlement and cultivation, boostingagricultural production.The estimated cost of the OCP during the whole ofits existence, from 1974 to 2000, is about $570 million.Its estimated internal rate of return is in the range of 16to 28 percent (depending on the pace at which thenewly available land is settled, the incremental outputadded by the new land, the income level of the OCParea, and the productivity growth rate that is pro-jected). These estimated benefits do not include theprogram's favorable effects on income distribution; itsmain beneficiaries are subsistence farmers whose in-comes are well below average. Jamaica children with moderate whipworm infec-tion scored 15 percent lower before treatment thanuninfected children in the same school. When re-tested after treatment, those same children did al-most as well as the uninfected children.In a sample of children in a poverty-strickenarea of northeast Brazil, inadequately nourishedchildren lagged 20 percent behind the average gainin achievement score over a two-year period. Thesame study also shows the harm done by a simpleand easily remedied handicap: children with badeyesight lagged 27 percent behind the averagegain over the two years. Both groups had below-average promotion rates and above-average drop-out rates. In China a child at the twentieth percen-tile in height-for-age (a sign of poor health) aver-ages about one-third of a year behind the gradenormally reached by children of that age. In Thai-land children whose height-for-age is 10 percentbelow average are 14 percent lower in gradeattainment.Girls are particularly liable to suffer from iodineor iron deficiencyreasons why fewer of themcomplete primary school. Other health-relatedreasons include dropping out as a result of preg-nancy and parental concern about sexual violence.In societies where girls' education is given lowerpriority than boys', girls miss school because theyhave to stay home to look after sick relatives. Reduced costs of medical careSpending that reduces the incidence of disease canproduce big savings in treatment costs. For somediseases the expenditure pays for itself even whenall the indirect benefitssuch as higher labor pro-ductivity and reduced pain and sufferingare ig-nored. Polio is one example. Calculations for theAmericas made prior to the eradication of polio inthe region showed that investing $220 million overfifteen years to eliminate the disease would pre-vent 220,000 cases and save between $320 million 19Box 1.2The economic impact of AIDSThe AIDS epidemic, through its effects on savings andproductivity, poses a threat to economic growth inmany countries that are already in distress. World Banksimulations indicate a slowing of growth of income percapita by an average 0.6 percentage point a year in theten worst-affected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. InTanzania, where income per capita has already fallen0.2 percent a year in recent years, the estimated slow-down ranges between 0.1 and 0.8 percentage point,depending on the assumptions used. In Malawi, whichhas had a recent growth rate of 0.9 percent a year, thesimulated reduction ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 percentagepoint. These calculations include the effect of the epi-demic on population growth, which will slow slightlyin severely affected countries.The heavy macroeconomic impact of AIDS comespartly from the high costs of treatment, which divertresources from productive investments. Tanzanian cli-nicians estimate that, on average, an HIV-infectedadult suffers 17 episodes of HIV-related illnesses priorto death and a child suffers 6.5 episodes. Dependingon how much medical care a patient gets, in the typicaldeveloping country the total cost per adult deathranges from 8 to 400 percent of annual income per cap-ita; the average is about 150 percent of annual incomeper capita.That AIDS kills so many skilled adults adds to itseconomic impact. At a large hospital in Kinshasa, forexample, more than 1 percent per year of the healthpersonnel, including highly trained staff, become in-fected (through sexual rather than occupational con-tact). Among the (largely male) employees at a Kin-shasa textile mill, managers had a higher infection ratethan foremen, who in turn had a higher rate thanworkers. The cost of replacing skilled workers will besubstantial. A study of Thailand estimates that through2000 the cost of replacing long-haul truckers lost toAIDS will be $8 million, and another study, of Tan-zania, projects the cost of replacing teachers at $40 mil-lion through 2010.The death of an adult can tip vulnerable householdsinto poverty. Even in Tanzania, where the governmentpays a large share of health costs, a World Bank studyshows that affected rural households in 1991 spent$60roughly the equivalent of annual rural income per capitaon treatment and funerals. The study alsoshowed that the effects of losing an adult persist intothe next generation as children are withdrawn fromschool to help at home. School attendance of youngpeople ages 15-20 is reduced by half if the householdhas lost an adult female member in the previous year. and $1.3 billion (depending on the number of peo-ple treated) in annual treatment costs. The pro-gram's net return, after discounting at even asmuch as 12 percent a year, was calculated to bebetween $18 million and $480 million.AIDS is another example. Although it remainsmuch less common in the developing world thandiseases such as malaria, its economic impact percase is greater for two reasons: it mainly affectsadults in their most productive years, and the in-fections resulting from it lead to heavy demand forexpensive health care (Box 1.2). For example, be-cause individuals with AIDS are typically moreprone to pneumonia, diarrhea, and tuberculosis,the cost of medical care is high even though thereis no effective treatment as yet for the disease it-self. Research in nine developing and seven high-income countries suggests that preventing a caseof AIDS saves, on average, about twice GNP percapita in discounted lifetime costs of medical care;in some urban areas the saving may be as much asfive times GNP per capita. Calculations for Indiashow that, given prevailing transmission patterns,each currently HIV-positive person infects one 20previously uninfected person every four years. Atthis rate, there will be six HIV-positive persons in2000 for every one today. If the transmission ratecould be slowed to one every five years, that num-ber could be reduced to only four infected persons in 2000 for every one today. The correspondingreduction in medical costs, after discounting at 3percent a year, amounts to $750 by 2000 for eachcurrently HIV-positive person in India, for a totalsaving of $750 million. Similar calculations forThailand suggest savings of $1,250 per currentlyHIV-positive person, for a potential total of $560million.Health investments and povertyThe goal of reducing poverty provides a differentbut equally powerful case for health investments.The adverse effects of ill health are greatest forpoor people, mainly because they are ill more of-ten, but partly because their income depends ex-clusively on physical labor and they have no sav-ings to cushion the blow. They may therefore findit impossible to recover from an illness with theirhuman and financial capital intact.The health consequences of poverty are severe:the poor die younger and suffer more from disabil-ity. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, adult mortality rates inpoor areas in the late 1980s were 75 percent higherthan in rich areas, and in S\u00e3o Paulo rates were twoto three times higher for nonprofessionals than forprofessionals. In the late 1970s among Kenyanfamilies in which the mother had no schooling, theprobability of dying by age 2 averaged 184 per1,000 in regions where half of the families livedbelow the poverty line but 100 per 1,000 in regionswhere only one-fifth of the families lived in pov-erty. The poor are exposed to greater risks fromunhealthy and dangerous conditions, both athome and at work. Malnourishment and the leg-acy of past illness mean that they are more likely tofall ill and slower to recover, especially as theyhave little access to health care.When a family's breadwinner becomes ill, othermembers of the household may at first cope byworking harder themselves and by reducing con-sumption, perhaps even of food. Both adjust-ments can harm the health of the whole family. Iffree health care is not available, the costs of treat-ment may drive a household deeper into debt. Al-though ill health is only one of many factors thatcan cause financial distress, its potential for disas-ter means that it should be explicitly recognized informulating policies. Investments to reduce healthrisks among the poor and provision of insuranceagainst catastrophic health care costs are impor-tant elements in a strategy for reducing poverty.Spending on health is a productive investment:it can raise incomes, particularly among the poor,and it reduces the toll of human suffering from illhealth. Good health, however, is a fundamentalgoal of development as well as a means of acceler-ating it. Targeting health as part of developmentefforts is an effective way to improve welfare inlow-income countries. Evidence gathered over thepast thirty years indicates that in health, unlikeincome, the gap between poor and rich countrieshas been narrowing.Putting the effects togetherThe detrimental effects of poor health on individ-uals and households and on the use of resourcessuggest that better health should lead to bettereconomic performance at the national level. Anumber of analyses have found a positive relation-ship between growth of income per capita and theinitial national educational stock. A similar analy-sis carried out for this Report examines the relationof growth in income per capita between 1960 and1990 in about seventy countries to the initial levelof national income, the initial educational level,and an indicator of initial health status (the childmortality rate, used in this Report to mean the riskof dying by age 5 per 1,000 live births). The healthstatus indicator is found to be a highly significantpredictor of economic performance. For the aver-age country in the sample, the annual growth rateof income per capita is 1.40 percent and the childmortality rate is 116 per 1,000. An otherwise aver-age country with a child mortality rate of 106would have a growth rate of income per capita of1.55 percent, whereas one with a child mortalityrate of 126 would have a growth rate of 1.26percent.Not surprisingly, the health status variable isstrongly correlated with educational stock, but thesignificant association between income growthand health remains strong and of similar magni-tude across time periods and for a range of modelformulations. Although it is possible that unob-served factors such as government capacity to im-plement effective policies could explain the appar-ent association, the data do suggest that betterhealth means more rapid growth.The record of successMortality started to decline in Europe, NorthAmerica, and Australasia about two centuries ago,but slowly at first. A century ago life expectancy inthe United States, then the world's richest coun-try, was only forty-nine years, and child mortalitywas about 180 per 1,000. The rate of improvementaccelerated in the first half of this century; by 1950life expectancy in the United States had increasedto sixty-six years, and child mortality had fallen to34 per 1,000. Progress was also being made in de-veloping countries: in Chile, for example, life ex-pectancy increased from thirty-seven years in 1930to forty-nine in 1950, and child mortality fell from350 to 209 per 1,000.Mortality transitions since 1950Health conditions around the world have im-proved more in the past forty years than in allprevious human history. Life expectancy at birthin developing countries increased from forty tosixty-three years, and child mortality fell from 280to 106 per 1,000. In a high-income country life ex-pectancy is more than seventy-five years; in a low-mortality developing country it is seventy years or 21Child mortality has fallen sharply in the past thirty years, with particularly rapid declines in parts of Asia andLatin America. 22Figure 1.1 Child mortality by country, 1960 and 1990 Source: Appendix A.Under-five mortality rate175 or more125-17475-124fl50-7425-49Less than 25more; and in Sub-Saharan Africa, the regionwhere least progress has been made, it is aboutfifty years.Much of what is known about the decline inmortality in the developing world since 1950 islimited to the mortality of children and has comefrom aseriesof standardized,internationallyfunded demographic surveys. Enormous reduc-tions in child mortality occurred almost every-where around the world between 1960 and 1990(Figure 1.1). For example, child mortality in Chiledropped from 155 to 20 per 1,000, in Tunisia from245 to 45, and in Sri Lanka from 140 to 22.The statistics for adult mortality in the develop-ing world are much less satisfactory than those forchild mortality. Approximate estimates for all de-veloping countries suggest that the adult mortalityrate (defined as the probability of dying betweenages 15 and 60 per 1,000 persons reaching age 15)fell from about 450 in 1950 to about 230 in 1990. InChile, a country with excellent statistics, the ratedropped from 466 in 1930 to 152 in 1990.The decline in mortality has accelerated over thepast thirty years. In the 1960s child mortality fellby approximately 2 percent a year in about seventydeveloping countries for which estimates are avail-able. The annual decline increased to more than 3percent in the 1970s and to more than 5 percent inthe 1980s. This result could be skewed by changesin the mix of countries with reliable data; therewere, however, twenty-one countries with a con-tinuous series of acceptable estimates of child mor-tality from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, and forthis group as a whole the fall in child mortalityaveraged 3 percent a year in the 1960s but 6 per-cent a year in the 1980s. in seventeen of thetwenty-one the pace of decline increased over theperiod.Regional patternsThe extent of success has varied significantly be-tween regions. Between 1950 and 1990 all eightdemographic regions used for this Report enjoyedincreases in life expectancy at birth, but China andthe Middle Eastern crescent did particularly well(see Figure 1.2). Sub-Saharan Africa showed theslowest improvement, with life expectancy in-creasing only from thirty-nine to fifty-two yearsalthough even this compares well with Europeanexperience in the nineteenth century. (It took En-gland and Wales more than half a century to raiselife expectancy by a similar amount.) The formerlysocialist economies of Europe showed a rapid im-provement in the 1950s and 1960s, but the rise wasmuch slower in the 1970s and 1980s.Life expectancy has increased substantiallyeverywhere over the past forty years.

There are strong parallels between the pattern ofmortality decline in the high-income countries andthe accelerated progress of developing countriesover the past forty years. In both groups the con-trol of communicable diseases, particularly thoseof childhood, accounts for most of the gains. (Theterm \"communicable diseases,\" in the analysesfor this Report, includes deaths from maternal andperinatal causes.) Progress against noncommuni-cable diseasesprimarily those of the circulatoryand respiratory systems, which principally affectadultshas been much slower. In both Chile (from1930 to 1987) and England and Wales (over thelonger period 1891 to 1990) mortality from commu-nicable disease fell to less than 5 percent of itsinitial level, whereas mortality from noncommuni-2319501960197019801990Mortality from communicable diseases has fallenmuch faster than that from noncommunicablediseases or injuries.

In Chile, for example, mortality risks up toage 30 fell by more than 90 percent between 1930and 1990; the decline was at least 60 percent atages 30-70, but above age 70 the gains were muchsmaller (Figure 1.4). The age pattern of mortalitydecline in Chile over sixty years is strikingly simi-lar to the pattern in England and Wales during theninety years from 1891 to 1981.The only exception to this broad similarity be-tween industrial and developing countries hasbeen in the formerly socialist economies. In thesecountries child mortality has continued to decline,as has the mortality of women, albeit more slowly.The mortality of adult men, on the other hand, hasstopped declining in the past two decades and hasactually started to increase. This excess male mor-NoncommunicablepdiseasesdCommunicablediseases N oncommunicabl ediseases Injuriestality is largely the result of extremely high deathrates from cardiovascular disease, associated withheavy smoking and drinking.Measuring the burden of diseaseThe health improvements of the past few decadeshave done much to enhance human welfare, bothdirectly and indirectly. But much more remains tobe done. Communicable (and largely preventable)diseases are still common. Health systems alsohave to cope with the aging of populations, whichleads to an increased burden of the more expen-sive noncommunicable diseases. New illnesses,such as AIDS, have emerged. One simple statisticgives a sense of the remaining burden of disease:about 12.4 million children under age 5 died in1990 in the developing world. Had those childrenfaced the mortality risks of children in the estab-lished market economies, the number of deathswould have been cut by more than 90 percent, to1.1 million.Any discussion of health policy must start witha sense of the scale of health problems. Theseproblems are often assessed in terms of mortality,but that indicator fails to account for the losses thatoccur this side of death because of handicap, pain,or other disability. A background study for thisReport, undertaken jointly with the World HealthOrganization, measures the global burden of dis-ease (GBD) by combining (a) losses from prema-ture death, which is defined as the difference be-tween actual age at death and life expectancy atthat age in a low-mortality population, and (b) lossof healthy life resulting from disability. The GBD ismeasured in units of disability-adjusted life years(DALYs). Worldwide, 1.36 billion DALYs were lostin 1990, the equivalent of 42 million deaths of new-born children or of 80 million deaths at age 50.Premature deaths were responsible for 66 percentof all DALYs lost and disabilities for 34 percent. Inthe developing world 67 percent of all DALY losswas a result of premature death; in the establishedmarket economies and the formerly socialist econ-omies of Europe the figure was only 55 percent.Table 1.1 shows the GBD broken down by sex,category of disease, and type of loss (prematuredeath or disability). The three categories of diseaseused are the group of communicable diseases,noncommunicable diseases, and injuries.The derivation and interpretation of the GBDare explained in Box 1.3. The results of research onthe GBD challenge the belief that the war againstinfectious and parasitic diseases has been won. Di-Table 1.1 Burden of disease by sex, cause,and type of loss, 1990(millions of DALYs) Sex and outcomeCommunicable'NoncommunicableInjuries and B. arrhea, childhood diseases such as measles, respi-ratory infections, worm infections, and malaria ac-count for one-quarter of the GBD. The burden ofthese largely preventable or inexpensively curablediseases of children is far larger in Sub-SaharanAfrica (43 percent of all DALYs lost) than any-where else, although it is still substantial in India(28 percent), Other Asia and islands (29 percent),and the Middle Eastern crescent (29 percent). Foradults too, communicable diseases are far fromtrivial: sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) andtuberculosis together contribute 7 percent of theGBD.Even as broad a measure as the GBD does notcapture all the consequences of disease or injury. Itexcludes the social costs of disfigurement, such asthat arising from river blindness or leprosy, and ofdysfunctionfor example, marital breakups re-sulting from obstetric fistula (permanent damageto the reproductive tract incurred during delivery).And some health-related factors are likely to beunderreported. A clear example is violence againstwomen, much of which goes undetectedbut notunsuffered.Comparisons of absolute numbers of DALYs lostmay be misleading because the sizes and age struc-tures of the populations at risk are not the same.The effects of population size can be allowed for byexpressing the 1990 burden per 1,000 population.Figure 1.5 shows the resulting rates by sex andregional group. This index is 259 for the world as awhole, but it varies widely among regions. Sub-Saharan Africa loses 574 DALYs for every 1,000population, more than twice the global average.India, the Middle Eastern crescent, and Other Asiaand islands all have values between 250 and 350.For China, the formerly socialist economies of Eu-rope, and Latin America and the Caribbean, thefigures are between 150 and 250. The burden perDisease category 25MalePremature death25915270Disability4714639FemalePremature death24413533Disability 741422026Box 1.3Measuring the burden of diseaseMost assessments of the relative importance of differ-ent diseases are based on how many deaths they cause.This convention has certain merits: death is an unam-biguous event, and the statistical systems of manycountries routinely produce the data required. Thereare, however, many diseases or conditions that are notfatal but that are responsible for great loss of healthylife: examples are chronic depression and paralysiscaused by polio. These conditions are common, canlast a long time, and frequently lead to significant de-mands on health systems.To quantify the full loss of healthy life, the WorldBank and the World Health Organization undertook ajoint exercise for this Report. Diseases were classifiedinto 109 categories on the basis of the International Clas-sification of Diseases (ninth revision). These categoriescover all possible causes of death and about 95 percentof the possible causes of disability. Using the recordedcause of death where available, and expert judgmentwhen records were not available, the study assigned alldeaths in 1990 to these categories by age, sex, and de-mographic region. For each death, the number of yearsof life lost was defined as the difference between theactual age at death and the expectation of life at thatage in a low-mortality population. For disability, theincidence of cases by age, sex, and demographic regionwas estimated on the basis of community surveys or,failing that, expert opinion; the number of years of Box figure 1.3 Age patterns of age weights and DALY losses Source: World Bank data.healthy life lost was then obtained by multiplying theexpected duration of the condition (to remission or todeath) by a severity weight that measured the severityof the disability in comparison with loss of life. Dis-eases were grouped into six classes of severity of dis-ability; for example, class 2, which includes most casesof leprosy and half the cases of pelvic inflammatorydisease, was given a severity weight of 0.22, and class4, which includes 30 percent of cases of dementia and50 percent of those of blindness, was assigned a sever-ity weight of 0.6. The death and disability losses werethen combined, and allowance was made for a dis-count rate of 3 percent (so that future years of healthylife were valued at progressively lower levels) and forage weights (so that years of life lost at different ageswere given different relative values). The value foreach year of life lost, shown in the left-hand panel ofBox figure 1.3, rises steeply from zero at birth to a peakat age 25 and then declines gradually with increasingage. These age weights reflect a consensus judgment,but other patterns could be usedfor example, uni-form age weights, with each year of life having thesame value, which would increase the relative impor-tance of childhood diseases.The combination of discounting and age weightsproduces the pattern of DALYs (disability-adjusted lifeyears) lost by a death at each age. As the right-handpanel of Box figure 1.3 shows, the death of a newborn DALYs lost by death at given year (females)Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs):: 20 0102030405060708090Age at death in yearsValue of a year of lifeRelative value of a year of life at age x16 12 01020 30 405060 708090Age xBox table 1.3 Distribution of DALY loss by cause and demographic region, 1990(percent) baby girl represents a loss of 32.5 DALYs; a femaledeath at age 30 means the loss of 29 DALYs; and afemale death at age 60 represents 12 lost DALYs.(Values are slightly lower for males.) The sum across allages, conditions, and regions is referred to as theglobal burden of disease (GBD). More details on theGBD are presented in Appendix B.The global burden measures the present value of thefuture stream of disability-free life lost as a result ofdeath, disease, or injury in 1990. It is thus based onevents that occurred in 1990 but includes the loss ofdisability-free life in future years. This Repott ex-presses the burden in three distinct ways: as the num-ber of DALYs, as a percentage of some larger aggregate(such as the percentage of total loss attributable to aspecific disease), and in relation to population size in1990. This last measure calls for careful interpretationbecause all future loss is expressed in relation to thecurrent population, and the measure can easily exceedDALY, year;Source: World Bank data. one year per person. A baby who died in 1990 contrib-uted about thirty-two years (the discounted value ofabout eighty years of expected life) to the burden butcounted as one in the population. To take an extremecase, if the entire population of the world were to bekilled in one year, the burden per 1,000 population inthat year would exceed 20,000 DALYs. There is there-fore no absolute scale with which the GBD per 1,000population can be compared; the only comparisonsthat make sense are those between categories-of re-gions, risk factors, disease groups, or sex. Box table 1.3shows the GBD by cause and demographic region.The approach used to compute the GBD can also beused to track improvements in a nation's health overtime by following changes in the national burden ofdisease. Preliminary plans for initial national assess-ments have been developed for Costa Rica, South Af-rica, and lifeSTD, sexually transmitted disease; HIV, human imniunodeficiency virus.Disease burdens per 1,000 population vari substantially by region. Figure 1.5 Disease burden by sex and demographic region, 1990 28Sub-Saharan AfriLa ChinaOther Asia and islandsLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle Eastern crescentFormerly socialist economies of EuropeEstablished market economies 1,000 population for the established market econ-omies is easily the lowest, at 117. It turns out thatthese broad rankings are not significantly affectedbydifferencesinagedistributionsbetweenregions.Females have abcut a 10 percent lower diseaseburden per 1,000 population than males for theworld as a whole. They lose fewer DALYs frompremature mortality, but their DALY loss from dis-ability is about the same as for males. Within thedisability category, however, the female diseaseburden from the group of communicable causes isconsiderably higher than that for males, partly be-cause of a substantial toll from maternal causes butalso because of the much greater female burdenassociated with STDs. Effective interventions existfor much of this excess female burden. For allcauses together, the female advantage ranges frommore than 30 percent in the formerly socialist -economies, where adult mortality is much higherfor men than for women, to negative in India,where females suffer a disadvantage of 8 percent.Both India and China show a female disadvantagein disease burden per 1,000 population, and, notcoincidentally, both countries also have large num-IIuuuIIIIIIIIIIIJuuuuIuuhuIIlu,IIuIIIIIIIIIJuIIuIuIu,IuIIIuIuuIuIIII IuIlIuuIuIIIIuuuuuuI,IIuuuIIlmzmIIIItItIIIIItIIlIIIIItIIlihI \"uu'I\"uIu',l\"u'uuuuuuIu,uu.HhI'lulul,' iiimuiuouimiiuiuuuiiuiiiiiiwuiuiuizz#YA/m/AIIIIIIIIlihIflIliulIUhILiIIIIIIlIIUIIIit,\" bers of \"missing\" (and presumed dead) women inrelation to the expected population balance be-tween the sexes.

More than 80 percent of the DALY lossfrom diarrhea is a result of infections in childrenunder age 5. Worm infections are concentratedamong children ages 5-14. More than half the bur-den of tuberculosis is borne by the 15-44 agegroup. More than 60 percent of the burden of isch-emic heart disease falls on the population over age60.The higher the disease burden, the higher theproportionattributabletothecommunicablegroup of causes (Figure 1.6). Sub-Saharan Africahas the highest disease burden per 1,000 popula-tion, and 71 percent of this is from the communica-ble disease group, whereas in Latin America (amedium-burden region) the figure is 42 percentand in the established market economies it is only10 percent. Noncommunicable diseases show theopposite pattern, accounting for 19 percent of thetotal burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, 43 percent inLatin America, and 78 percent in the establishedmarket economies. Despite these marked differ-ences in relative burden, however, the absoluterates of loss for both groups are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and lowest in the established mar-ket economies. The pattern is plain: as health im-proves, the burden from all types of diseasedeclines, but the distribution of the burden shiftsdramatically from a preponderance of communica-ble disease to a preponderance of noncommunica-ble disease.Despite the sharp improvements in healtharound the world, the GBD calculations show thata large burden of premature mortality and disabil-ity still remains, particularly in the world's poorerregions. There are inexpensive and effective waysto eliminate the share caused by communicablediseases (other than maternal and perinatal condi-tions), which is roughly 35 percent of the worldburden and more than 60 percent in Sub-SaharanAfrica. The remaining 65 percent of the world bur-den is less responsive to such measures, and re-ducing it will require changes in the behavior andlife-styles of adults.Challenges for the futureNew health challenges will emerge over the nextfew decades. Some are certain: these involve thesignificant increase in noncommunicable diseasesarising from the continuing demographic transi-tion. Others are less certain: the spread of HIV andthe increase in AIDS deaths; the increasing num-The share of communicable diseases in the diseaseburden declines as mortaliti rates fall.

Although nobody can forecast the impactof these challenges with any precision, reasonableprojections are possible. For example, outside theestablished market economies the number ofdeaths attributable to smoking is expected to in-crease from 1.7 million in 1990 (40 percent of whichwere in the formerly socialist economies of Eu-rope) to more than 3 million by 2005 and to about4.5 million by 2015.

The overall transition fromhigh mortality and high fertility to low mortalityBox 1.4The demographic andepidemiological transitionsChanges in the pattern of disease proceed in two steps.The first is the demographic transition, when mortalityfrom infectious disease declines and, partly as a result,fertility decreases as well. 'The second, a consequenceof declining fertility and differential rates of dedineamong causes of death, is the epidemiological transi-tion. The population grows older, and noninfectiousdiseases become the main causes of ill health. healthpatterns in the developing world over the next threedecades will he profoundly influenced by both thesetransitions.Itis commonly assumed that when a country isgoing through its demographic transition, the changesin its health indicators are primarily a function of de-clines in mortality. In fact, both the age structure andthe cause-of-death structure are strongly influenced bythe rapid decline in fertility. When fertility is high, theage structure of a population is heavily skewed towardthe young, irrespective of the level of mortality. Be-cause birth rates remain high and larger numbers ofwomen enter the reproductive ages every year, thebase of the population is continually expanding. Whenbirth rates start to fall rapidly, the absolute number ofbabies born each year may remain unchanged or evendecline. As Box figure 1.4 shows, the shape of the agestructure of the population then begins to be trans-formed from a broad-based triangle into a rectangle, oreven into a pear shape with a more pronounced nar-rowing of the base. and low fertilityis essentially complete in thehigh-income countries and has almost been com-pleted in China and Latin America. Even in Sub-Saharan Africa fertility seems to be starting todecline.The systematic relationship between gains in lifeexpectancy and reductions in fertility is expectedto continue into the next century. Figure 1.7 showsthis relationship for two developing regions at dif-ferent stages of the transition, Latin America andSub-Saharan Africa. The projected changes forSub-Saharan Africa are substantial, but they aresimilar in magnitude to those that have alreadyoccurred in Latin America. In much of the devel-oping world the decline in death rates has pre-ceded the decline in birth rates by two decades ormore, resulting in temporarily high rates of popu-lation growth of 3 or even, occasionally, 4 percenta year. (By contrast, in the established marketeconomies and the formerly socialist economies ofEurope birth and death rates declined more or lessWorldwide, fertilitit and mortality declines go handin hand.

As fertility de-clines, age structures in these countries are evolv-ing toward the existing patterns in the establishedmarket economies and the formerly socialist econ-omies (see Box 1.4). The proportion of the popula-tion age 65 and over is expected to increase from 4percent in 1990 to 9 percent by 2030 (in absolutenumbers, from 184 million to 678 million). As aresult, the burden from noncommunicable dis- All regions will experience the health transition, butthe timing will differ. 32Figure 1.8 Median age at death, bydemographic region, 1950, 1990, and 2030 Median age at death (years)a80 60 40 20onr1950 U Sub-Saharan Africao Middle Eastern crescentUI IndiaU Other Asia and islandsLI Latin America and the Caribbeano China The age below which half of all deaths in a year occur.Projected.Source: World Bank data.9902030beases will increase sharply, both absolutely andproportionately. At the same time, the challenge ofcommunicable diseases of the young will persist.Despite declines in fertility, the number of birthseach year in developing countries will rise some-what, from 127 million in 1990 to 145 million in2020, before decreasing to 142 million in 2030. Thenumber of children under age 5 will increase morerapidly, from 552 million in 1990 to 682 million in2030. These changes, which took a century to com-plete in today's high-income countries, are occur-ring within fifty years or less in parts of the devel-oping world.In judging the importance of the health prob-lems of the young in comparison with those of theelderly, one useful guide is the median age atdeath. For all six regions of the developing world,the median was below 20 in 1950, indicating thedominance of the health problems of children. By1990 the median had risen close to age 60 in Chinaand in Latin America but was scarcely above 5 inSub-Saharan Africa and was still below 25 in theMiddle Eastern crescent (see Figure 1.8). By 2030,assuming that current trends continue, the medianage at death will have risen above 60 in all regionsexcept Sub-Saharan Africa, where it will still beclose to 40.The message from these population projectionsis that health services must plan for a modest in-crease in child-related demands over the next fortyyears. At the same time, the numbers of the el-derly, with very different health needs, will be ris-ing sharply. The pace of demographic change hasbeen, and is expected to continue to be, faster inthe developing world than it was in the high-income countries, and the problems of adaptationare therefore greater. Because treatments for non-communicable diseases are often expensive, thereis a danger that these diseases will absorb re-sources needed to combat communicable diseases(which will still be widespread). This kind of di-lemma has already been noted in World Bankstudies in Brazil and China.HiVand AiDSMore than 80 percent of the estimated 8.8 millionpeople infected with HIV in 1990 lived in develop-ing countries. There the disease is primarily one ofheterosexual adults, with substantial perinatal in-fection of young children. Of the eight demo-graphic regions used in this Report, only the for-merly socialist economies, the Middle Easterncrescent, and China have little recorded spread ofTable 1.3 Evolution of the HIV-AIDS epidemic the virus. Spread of the virus may be about tooccur even in these three regions. It takes six to tenyears, on average, for an HIV-infected adult to de-velop AIDS. Thus, regardless of future changes intransmission of the virus, there will certainly be anincreasing number of AIDS cases over the next fewyears.It is difficult to predict the future course of theepidemic because so little is known about the dy-namics of HIV transmission. WHO has projectedthat in 2000, 2.5 million people will be newly infec-ted with HIV, HIV prevalence will have reached 26million, and AIDS deaths will total 1.8 million (seeTable 1.3). These estimates are conservative, sincethey assume that the rate of new infections in Af-rica will slow somewhat and that new transmis-sion will be concentrated in India and in the OtherAsia and islands region. If no effective interven-tions to slow transmission are introduced, the totalnumber of deaths may be twice as large, in whichcase AIDS would be responsible for 8 percent ofthe global burden of disease by 2000 instead of the3.5 percent implied by the estimates in Table 1.3.If, however, sexual behavior changes dramaticallyover the next decade, even the conservative pro-jections given here may prove too pessimistic.Relatively modest reductions in numbers of casualsexual partners, or in the prevalence of STDs-or,alternatively,substantial increasesin condomuse-couldreducetransmissionsignificantly.Early (and still tentative) findings from Thailandare encouraging; perhaps behavior really willchange.Opinions differ concerning the effects of AIDSon population growth.

In the African communities that aremost severely affected, early assessments pre-dicted absolute declines in population. Later viewssuggest that population growth will continue, al-beit at a reduced rate. Trial projections for Sub-Saharan Africa, based on a high assumption ofHIV prevalence of 60 million infections worldwidein 2000, suggest a reduction in life expectancy by2010 of about six years, in comparison with a low-HIV model, and a 25 percent increase in adult mor-tality. The effect on population growth would stillbe modest: a reduction of about 0.25 percentagepoint a year, to an annual rate of 2.7 rather than2.95 percent in 2005-10. In areas such as Thailandwhere fertility and mortality rates are much lowerthan in Sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS may well con-tribute to actual population declines over a periodof thirty years or more.Drug-resistant diseasesMicrobes evolve as a result of natural mutation,which throws up new threats, and of drug thera-py-induced selection, which fosters drug resis-tance. Two major new threats have arisen in thiscentury: the influenza virus responsible for the1918-19 worldwide epidemic, and HIV.The evolution of drug resistance, partly drivenby incomplete or inadequate treatment, is moregradual and less dramatic but no less serious. Theeveryday bacteria responsible for pneumonias anddiarrheas have become resistant to the older anti-biotics and will gradually do the same with thenewer antibiotics developed over the 1.410.10.1Total 1.72.58.8260.41.8Life expectancy is related to income, but therelationship has shifted upward during the twentiethcen tu rlf.

Tuberculosis resistant to the standard mix ofantibiotics is becoming more common in the in-dustrial world, and it kills many of those who con-tractit.Chloroquine-resistant malaria has nowspread to practically all endemic areas, and al-though new drug therapies are available, wide-spread resistance even to several of these is beingreported. Malaria has thus reemerged as a signifi-cant health risk in urban areas that had been freeof it for several decades. Resurgence of the diseasehas been abetted by the reduced effectiveness ofvector control, which is partly attributable to theincreasing resistance of mosquitoes to standard in-secticides. Resistant strains of many STDs are also34emerging. In the developing world the diseases forwhich drug resistance is already a major issue (re-spiratory infections, tuberculosis, STDs, and ma-laria) accounted for almost one-fifth of the GBD in1990.This steady evolution of drug-resistant microbesposes challenges for research and for health care.Betterunderstandingofinfectiousagentsisneeded as a basis for the development of new ther-apies. Health providers must consider the effectsof drug use on the evolution of resistant microbialstrains. Basic scientific advances can contribute totracking resistance, as recently shown by develop-ments in identifying drug-resistant strains of tu-berculosis. There is little reason to hope for perma-nentsuccessinhumanity's struggleagainstinfection; investments in scientific research andvigilance on the part of public health authoritieswill remain indispensable.These problems arising from microbial evolutionare most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa. If efforts tocontrol the spread of HIV fail, by 2000 an addi-tional 1 million people in the region will be dyingfrom AIDS each year. Most of them will be youngadults who would otherwise have gone on to livehealthy lives. If malaria develops resistance to allavailable drugs, the number of people it kills everyyear could increase sharply, from the expected 1.5million deaths in 2000 to 2.3 million. Sub-SaharanAfrica might also suffer from a tuberculosis epi-demic, driven partly by drug resistance and partlyby the spread of the disease by people with HIV.Extrapolation of current trends indicates an annualtotal of 8.5 million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of the century. But it isall too easy to project a figure as high as 11.5 mil-lion, accompanied by a sharp reduction in lifeexpectancy.Lessons from the past: explaining declinesin mortalityThree factors have been important in the dramaticand unprecedented mortality declines of the pasthundred years and in the still more dramatic de-clines in developing countries since World War II.These factors are income growth, improvements inmedical technology, and public health programscombined with the spread of knowledge abouthealth. Income growthIncreased income allows people, particularly thepoor, to buy more food, better housing, and morehealth care. Throughout the twentieth century lifeexpectancy has been strongly associated at the na-tional level with income per capita, as seen in Fig-ure 1.9. Life expectancy rises rapidly with incomeat low levels of income, particularly when incomeper capita is less than $3,000 (1991 purchasingpower dollars). The figure shows, however, thatthe relationship has shifted upward over eachthirty-year period, so that more health is realizedfor a given income. For example, in 1900 life expec-tancy in the United States was about forty-nineyears and income per capita in 1991 dollars wasabout $4,800. In 1990 that income per capita wouldbe associated with a life expectancy of about sev-enty-one years. This upward shift shows thathealth depends on more than income alone. Improvements in medical technologyBefore the 1930s medical technology had little tooffer humanity, with the exception of smallpox in-oculation, the use of which was widespread in Eu-rope from the late eighteenth century onward, anddiphtheria antitoxin, discovered in 1894. Startingin the 1930s, with the introduction of antibacterialdrugs and new vaccines, a wide range of effectiveinterventions has become available to countermost communicable diseases.The effect of these technological improvementson health has depended on other factors, such asincome gains for the poor, increased schooling,and public policies that affect health systems. As aresult, outcomes have varied widely by country,even within the same region. For example, in theearly 1980s child mortality was three times higherin Mali than in Botswana, six times higher in Boli-via than in Chile, and five times higher in Ban-gladesh than in Sri Lanka. Between the early 1960sand the early 1980s child mortality fell 20 percentin Bangladesh but 65 percent in Sri Lanka, 10 per-cent in Uganda but 50 percent in Kenya, and 10percent in Haiti but nearly 80 percent in CostaRica. Some countries have clearly made better useof the available technology than others. Public health and the spread of knowledgeThe introduction of public health measurespar-ticularly clean water, sanitation, and food regula-tioncertainly contributed to the decline in childmortality in the late nineteenth century and to theaccelerated decline in the early twentieth century.The geographic distribution of mortality declinessuggests, however, that until people began to un-derstand the sources of poor health, such publichealth measures were responsible for only a smallpart of the progress made. In the late nineteenthcentury Robert Koch showed that the bacteriumM. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, and people be-gan to understand about germs. They took simpleprecautionspreparing food and disposing ofwaste hygienically, eliminating flies, and quaran-tining sick family membersthat had far-reachingbenefits. Recent research has shown that childmortality differed little by education or even byincome in the United States in the last decade ofthe nineteenth century but that differences wid-ened sharply as child mortality fell in the earlytwentieth century. The implication is that afflu-ence and education made little difference until sci-entific knowledge showed households how toreduce the dangers to their health. Since better-educated individuals acquire and use new infor-mation more quickly, this emphasis on knowledgehelps to explain the large differences in child mor-tality by mother's education observed in develop-ing countries today.The potential for effective actionThe recent declines in mortality in the developingworld have been sharper than the earlier declinesin the high-income countries and more influencedby technical advances. To take one example, SriLanka achieved a remarkable decrease in mortalityafter World War II; the crude death rate fell from21.5 per 1,000 in 1945 to 12.4 in 1950. Some 23percent of that drop has been attributed to the ma-laria eradication program, which mainly involvedspraying of insecticide from the air. The same ap-proach also did much to control yellow fever, on-chocerciasis, and many other diseases. Wide-spread use of newly available antibiotics againstconditions such as yaws in Africa helped to reduceSTDs and (probably) acute respiratory infections.Improvements in water and sanitation curbed thespread of disease, particularly in towns and cities.Whereas at the beginning of this century childmortality rates in today's high-income countrieswere much higher in urban than in rural areas, theopposite has been true of the developing worldsince 1950.Vaccination, too, has produced dramatic results,including the eradication of smallpox and the elim-ination of paralytic polio in the Western Hemi-sphere. About 80 percent of the world's childrenare now vaccinated against the main infectious dis-eases of childhood, thanks largely to the ExpandedProgramme on Immunization (EPI) sponsored byWHO and UNICEF. It is estimated that the EPI35prevented the deaths of 2.6 million children in1990 alone. Substantial benefits have also comefrom simple curative measures such as oral re-hydration to avert death from diarrhea and a shortcourse of drugs for curing tuberculosis. But thereis much more still to be done: in 1990 childhooddeaths from diarrhea and immunizable diseasesalone accounted for 12 percent of the GBD.The march of science has increased both therange of inexpensive clinical treatments and prac-tices and the potential performance of health sys-tems. It is now possible to treat at low cost tuber-culosis, STDs, many respiratory infections, andrisky deliveries, which together accounted for 36more than 20 percent of the GBD in 1990. Epide-miological advances are giving governments andhouseholds warning of the enormous health tollfrom smoking. But if the full benefits of scientificadvances are to be realized, parallel developmentsare needed to empower households so that theycan put the advances into practice. The key devel-opments are schooling, particularly of girls; in-come growth, particularly of the poor; and a flex-ible, responsive health system able to provide thenecessary preventive and curative care. The poli-cies needed to achieve these developments are thesubject of the remainder of this Report.Households and health What people do with their lives and those of theirchildren affects their health far more than any-thing that governments do. But what they can dois determined, to a great extent, by their incomeand knowledgefactors that are not completelywithin their control. In every society, moreover,the capabilities, income, and status of women ex-ert a powerful influence on health. Because ofthese interrelations, government actions, through Economic growth and investments in human resources interact to improve well-being.their effects on the conditions facing householdsand individuals, can be important to people'shealth. Especially in the poorest countries, policiesthat accelerate income growth and reduce povertymake it possible for people to afford better diets,healthier living conditions, and better health care.Policies to expand educational opportunities, par-ticularly for girls, help households achieve health-ier lives by increasing their access to information Figure 2.1 Mutually reinforcing cycles: reduction of povertyand development to make good use of it. The samegoes for policies that work to ensure effective andaccessible health services for all. When all thesepolicies are combined, they create a virtuous cyclein which reduction of poverty and improvementsin health reinforce each other (Figure 2.1). 38Box 2.1Progress in child health in four countriesIn the 1960s a child born in the developing world had a77 percent chance of surviving the first five years oflife. About thirty years later, the chances of survivalhave improved to 89 percent. How much did incomegrowth and expansion of schooling contribute to thisgain? What was the role of other factors, such as prog-ress in science and medicine? Some answers to thesequestions emerge from data on child survival from sev-enty-five industrial and developing countries for theperiod between 1960 and 1987 (see note to Appendixtable A.3). This box reviews the results for four coun-tries with different income levels-Costa Rica, C\u00f4ted'Ivoire, Egypt, and Japan (see Box table 2.1 and Boxfigure 2.1).In all four countries, part of the gain in child healthdepends on the initial levels in 1960 of schooling in thepopulation and of income per capita. Because school-ing and income per capita produce health benefits thatoften persist through time, health in a population maybe improved simply by maintaining initial levels ofschooling and income. In Costa Rica, where in 1960income per capita was relatively high and schoolingwas already widespread, initial conditions accountedfor 58 percent of the gain in child health between 1960and 1987. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Egypt, where the levelsof schooling and income per capita were modest in1960,initial conditions contributed only about one-fifth to one-quarter of the gains. In Japan, too, theseinitial conditions contributed a fifth of the gains in childhealth, but this is not surprising in a country where ababy's chance of survival was already very good in1960.In reality, of course, income and schooling have im-proved in all these countries, and these improvementscontributed to further gains in child survival. In C\u00f4ted'Ivoire educational improvements did the most forchild health, accounting for 66 percent of the gains be-tween 1960 and 1980. For Egypt, by contrast, the figurewas only 21 percent. A comparison between C\u00f4ted'Ivoire and Egypt is illuminating. The probability ofsurviving the first five years of life started at similaFlevels in both countries and improved at comparablerates. In both, too, the responsiveness of child survivalto income per capita and to the schooling of adults wascomparable. In C\u00f4te d'lvoire, however, adult schoolingstarted from much lower levels than in Egypt but in-creased five times faster. Income per capita in C\u00f4ted'lvoire was nearly twice Egypt's in 1960 but then grewHousehold capacity: income and schoolingWithin the household, health improves rapidly aspeople escape from poverty and low education(Box 2.1). Beyond the household, every society'shealth services are affected by its national income, only 60 percent as fast. Thus, improvements in school-ing were most significant in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, whereas inEgypt growth in income per capita accounted for fullyhalf of the gain in child health.Costa Rica and Japan followed the same pattern asEgypt: growth of income per capita contributed sub-stantially more to child health gains than did educa-tional improvements. Technical progress (estimatedusing the passage of time as a proxy), however, wasimportant in Japan, whereas in Costa Rica and Egypt itmattered less than improvements in education. Exceptin Japan, where people were already quite well edu-cated in 1960, the analysis probably underestimatedthe contribution of schooling because it dealt with theschooling of all adults rather than of women alone.Child health is particularly affected by maternal educa-tion, and the number of years of schooling received byyounger women is likely to have risen much faster be-tween 1960 and 1987 than was the case for the adultpopulation as a whole.

Income growth has moreimpact in poor populations because additional re-sources buy basic necessities, particularly foodand shelter,that yield especially large healthbenefits.Because poverty has a powerful influence onhealth, it is not just income per capita that is rele-vant; the distribution of income and the number of 40Note: Child mortality indexes for each neighborhood arecalculated by dividing the observed number of deathsamong children of women in the sampled households ofa neighborhood by the expected number (given thedistribution of women by the length of time they havebeen bearing children and the national average childmortalitylevelsat each duration ofchildbearing).

In industrialcountries life expectancy depends much more onincome distribution than on income per capita,and it has been rising faster in countries with im-proving income distribution. Japan and the UnitedKingdom had similar income distributions and lifeexpectancies in 1970, but they have diverged sincethen. Japan now has the highest life expectancy inthe world and a highly egalitarian income distribu-tion. In the United Kingdom, where income dis-parity has widened since the mid-1980s, life expec-tancy is now more than three years shorter than inJapan.In developing countries the number of people inpoverty is an especially important reason for dif-ferences in health. One study looked at twenty-two developing countries with comparable data onpoverty (defined as the share of the populationconsuming less than $1 a day at 1985 purchasingpower parity prices) and found that variation inthe prevalence of poverty and in per capita publicspending on health is important in explainingcross-country variation in life expectancy. Differ-ences in income per capita became unimportantonce those two factors were taken into account.This does not mean that income growth is irrele-vant to increased life expectancy; rather, its maineffect lies in how much it reduces poverty andsupports public health services. In the twenty-twocountries, roughly one-third of the effect of eco-nomic growth on life expectancy came throughpoverty reduction and the remaining two-thirdsthrough increased public spending on health. InSri Lanka an increase in per capita public spendingon health was twenty-two times more effective inreducing infant mortality than was the same in-crease in average income.Within countries, too, health correlates stronglywith poverty. In India, Indonesia, and Kenya childmortality is higher in states or provinces withlarger proportions of poor people. Within cities,there are large differences in child survival be-tween rich and poor neighborhoods (Figure 2.2).And children in poor families are less healthy. InMadurai, the second largest city in India's TamilNadu State, children ages 2-9 in the pooresthouseholds were more than twice as likely to suf-fer from serious physical or mental disabilities aschildren from slightly better-off families.Poor people are vulnerable to disease not onlybecause of poor living conditions but often also forwork-related reasons. In Adana, Turkey, the riskof malaria is significantly greater among migrantworkers than for the local population; the averageCairo, EgyptColombo,Lima, PeruSri Lankanumber of anopheline mosquito bites per personwas five times greater in the tents of these workersthan in the houses of village residents. In SriLanka one of the commonest causes of pesticidepoisoning is leaky knapsack sprayers; surveysshow that although farmers are aware of the risksinvolved, they continue to use broken equipmentbecause they cannot afford to replace or repair it.The distribution of income within householdsalso affects health. Increasing women's access toincome can be especially beneficial for the healthof children. In Brazil income in the hands of themother has a bigger effect on family health thanincome controlled by the father. In Jamaica house-holds headed by women eat more nutritious foodthan those headed by men; they also spend moreof their income on child-centered goods and signif-icantly less on alcohol. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire a doublingof household income under women's control re-duces the share of alcohol in the family budget by26 percent and the share of cigarettes by 14 per-cent. In Guatemala it takes fifteen times morespending to achieve a given improvement in childnutrition when income is earned by the father thanwhen it is earned by the mother. Although a work-ing mother may breastfeed less and have less timefor child careboth of which could be detrimentalto her children's healthevidence from numerousdeveloping countries suggests that this harm canbe offset by the health benefits that her earningsbring.Because fewer people live in poverty as averageincomes rise, there is generally a strong link be-tween incomes and health status. Across coun-tries, more than 75 percent of the difference inhealth is associated with income differences. In-deed, this relation is not merely associative butcausal and structural: income growth leads di-rectly to better health. In a sample of fifty-eightdeveloping countries, a 10 percent increase in in-come per capita, all else being equal, reduced in-fant and child mortality rates by between 2.0 and3.5 percent and increased life expectancy by amonth. This estimate reflects the total impact ofincome on health; it includes effects working di-rectly through income (such as food consump-tion), as well as indirectly through factors that arethemselves mainly determined by income (accessto safe water and sanitation, availability of physi-cians, and so on). Studies based on individualhouseholds corroborate the cross-country results.A 10 percent advantage in income reduces infantmortality by between 1 and 2 percent in Nigeria,Sri Lanka, Thailand, and several Latin AmericanChild mortality falls faster in countries where incomeper capita is growing rapidly.

Child health has been im-proving everywhere, but gains are much less rapidin countries with slow income growth (Figure 2.3).During the 1980s the economic performance of de-veloping countries was mixed, with income percapita constant or falling, and in some countriesthe incidence of poverty rose (Table 2.1). Had eco-nomic growth been as fast in the 1980s as in theperiod between 1960 and 1980, in 1990 alone anestimated 350,000 infant deaths, or 6 percent oftotal infant deaths, would have been averted indeveloping countries (excluding India and China).In Africa and Latin America, where averagegrowth was 2.5 percentage points slower duringthe 1980s, the saving in babies' lives in 1990 would 41- .1 I.

Latin America's recession in 1983 is esti-mated to have caused 12,000 additional deaths ofbabies, or 2 percent of all infant deaths in that year.And because slow economic growth hampers pov-erty reduction and constrains spending on health,schooling, and other services, it is highly likelythat the health of the poor suffered dispropor-tionately in the 1980s. The influence of schooling on healthHouseholds with more education enjoy betterhealth, both for adults and for children. This resultisstrikingly consistent in a great number ofstudies, despite differences in research methods,time periods, and population samples. MATERNAL SCHOOLING AND CHILD HEALTH. Inmost households women have the main responsi-bility for a broad range of activities that affecthealth. They manage household chores, keep thehouse clean, process foods and prepare meals,feed and care for young children, and look afterthe sick. Women's own health and their efficiencyin using available resources have an importantbearing on the health of others in the family, par-ticularly children. A study of children under 10 in 42Bangladesh, for example, found that over a periodof two years following the death of a mother, mor-tality rates, in comparison with those of childrenwith living mothers, were twice as high for boysand three times as high for girls.Education greatly strengthens women's abilityto perform their vital role in creating healthyhouseholds. It increases their ability to benefitfrom health information and to make good use ofhealth services; it increases their access to incomeand enables them to live healthier lives. It is notsurprising, therefore, that a child's health is af-fected much more by the mother's schooling thanby the father's schooling. Data for thirteen Africancountries between 1975 and 1985 show that a 10percent increase in female literacy rates reducedchild mortality by 10 percent, whereas changes inmale literacy had little influence. Demographicand Health Surveys in twenty-five developingcountries show that, all else being equal, even oneto three years of maternal schooling reduces childmortality by about 15 percent, whereas a similarlevel of paternal schooling achieves a 6 percentreduction. The effects increase when mothers havehad more education; in Peru, for example, sevenor more years of maternal schooling reduces themortality risks nearly 75 percent, or about 28 per-cent more than the reduction for the same level ofpaternal schooling (Figure 2.4). Countries that in1965 had achieved near-universal enrollment forboys but much less for girls had about twice theinfant mortality in 1985 of countries with a smallerboy-girl gap.The advantages that a mother's schooling con-fers on her children's health are felt even beforebirth.In developing countries better-educatedwomen marry and start their families later, dimin-ishing the risk to child health associated with earlypregnancies. Educated women also tend to makegreater use of prenatal care and delivery assis-tance. In a study in Lima that controlled for serviceavailability and socioeconomic status, 82 percentof women with six or more years of educationsought prenatal care, compared with only 62 per-cent for women with no education.Following birth,thechildrenof educatedmothers continue to enjoy other health-enhancingadvantages: better domestic hygiene, which re-duces the risk of infection; better food and moreimmunization, both of which reduce susceptibilityto infection; and wiser use of medical services. Astudy of women in Bangladesh documented howeducated women kept their homes and childrentidier and cleaner than on the mother's than on the fat her's schooling.

In Brazil, India, and Nigeria better-edu-cated households are willing to pay 6 to 50 percentmore than other households for improved watersupplies.Educated mothers are also better at getting in-formation on health and acting on it. In Brazil thechild health benefits of a father's education workmostly through his income, whereas almost all theeffect of maternal education comes from learningabout health through newspapers, television, andradio. In Thailand mothers with primary educa-tion were 30 percent more likely than motherswith no education to treat childhood diarrhea withoral rehydration therapy or a homemade solutionof salt and sugar; this figure rose to 90 percent formothers with secondary or higher education. Sim-ilar results have been reported in countries as di-verse as Burundi, Colombia, Ghana, Morocco, andNigeria. And well-educated mothers often manageto reduce the damage that poverty does to health.Among poor rural households in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, for7 or more years of schoolingPercentage reduction in child mortality(in relation to parents with no schooling)020406080 example, 24 percent of the children of motherswith no education were stunted, compared withonly 11 percent of children of mothers with someelementary schooling. Educated women are an im-portant part of the reason for the impressivehealth achievements of China, Costa Rica, India'sKerala State, and Sri Lanka, despite relatively lowincomes. SCHOOLING AND ADULT HEALTH. Personal habitsand life-style choices affect adult health enor-mously. Because educated people tend to makechoices that are better for their health, there is of-ten a strong relation between schooling andhealth. A study of U.S. life expectancy at age 25found that between the highest and the lowestlevels of education, the difference was about sixyears for white men and about five years for whitewomen. These differenceswhich may partly re-flect differences in income associated with educa-tionhave persisted since the 1960s.The same pattern occurs in developing coun-tries. Surveys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Pakistan, 43Schoolinc reduces the risk of adult ill heal Figure 2.5 Schooling and risk factors foradult health in Porto Alegre, Brazil, 1987 Prevalence of risk (percent)100 80 60 40 20- U No schoolingU Postsecondary schooling Source: Achutti and others 1988. and Peru show that respondents whose parentswere educated were more likely to have living par-ents than those with uneducated parents. In Peru72 percent of the educated fathers of respondentsages 25-29 were still alive at the time of the survey,compared with only 55 percent of the uneducatedfathers. In Jamaica education had a bigger influ-ence on adult health than did income, particularlybefore age 50. Death rates for specific diseases alsoshow educational differentials. In Russia deathfrom coronary heart disease was two to threetimes more common for the poorly educated thanfor those with higher education. In Brazil thosewho were illiterate or who had only primaryschooling were about five times more likely tohave high blood pressure than those with post-secondary schooling. The first group was also sub-stantially more inclined to obesity, alcohol and to-bacco consumption, and lack of exercise (Figure2.5).The advantages of education continue to showup when new types of health risk appear. For ex- 44ample, when the AIDS epidemic began, infectionwas initially concentrated among well-educatedelites, but these same groups were the first tochange their life-stylesas information becameavailable about the disease and its prevention. InBrazil between 1982 and 1985, 79 percent of thoseinfected had completed postsecondary education;by the late 1980s this group's share of cases hadfallen to 33 percent. Even more striking is the waythat well-educated people have changed their be-havior on smoking. In the United Kingdom theproportion of smokers among adults declined be-tween 1958 and 1975 by 50 percent among themost educated but hardly changed among theleast educated. In the United States between 1974and 1987 the smoking habit declined nine timesfaster in the highest education group than in thelowest. The corresponding difference was twofoldin Canada and threefold in Norway.Policies to strengthen household capacityBecause people's ability to improve their ownhealth depends so much on income and educa-tion, the policy conclusions are clear: governmentsshould work to boost economic growth, reducepoverty, expand schooling (particularly for girls),and help strengthen women's ability to care fortheir families. This section deals with each of thesepoints in turn. Promoting growth and reducing povertyDuring the 1980s the pattern of economic growthin developing countries was very uneven. Incomeper capita grew at more than 6 percent a year inEast Asia but remained constant or fell in manyother countries. The disappointing record re-flected the impact of adverse external shocks aswell as poor domestic policies. Nonetheless, someeconomies grew rapidly despite the externalshocks, showing that a great deal can be done bydeveloping countries themselves.Because it is difficult to reduce poverty withouteconomic growth, establishing sound economicpolicies for growth is one of the most valuablethings a government can do. Development strate-gies also need to emphasize broadly based growthto give the poor better income-earning oppor-tunities and better access to a range of social ser-vices. To protect the most vulnerable members ofsociety, it is appropriate for governments to maketransfers and other special arrangements.POLICY REFORM AND ADJUSTMENT LENDING. As aconsequence of the economic crisis of the early1980s, many developing countries changed theireconomic policies. They adopted macroeconomicreforms intended to achieve price stability and sus-tainable internal and external monetary balanceand made microeconomic and institutional re-forms to promote the efficient use of resources andfaster economic growth. These changes typicallyinvolved cuts in public spending, the opening ofthe economy to competition, liberalization ofprices, measures to improve the efficiency of pub-lic expenditure, and the development of a soundfinancial system and other institutions needed in awell-functioning market economy.To support these reforms, the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund have extendedadjustment lending. The purpose of this lending isto cushion an economy during the transitionalphase to its new growth path. Adjustment lendingis therefore essentially an investment in a moreproductive future. It has been central to the re-forms in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africaand important in other regions as well. Its role willcontinue in the 1990s: it is already a major channelof assistance for the formerly socialist economies;it is being used for the first time in India; and it hasboth old and new clients in other parts of theworld.Nonetheless, adjustment lending remains con-troversial. Does it really raise long-term growth?Do the poor suffer as a consequence of such ad-justment policies as cuts in public spending andliberalization of food and other prices? How ishealth affected? The answers to these questionsare complicated because adjustment lending is nei-ther necessary nor sufficient for policy reform.Some of the most dramatic \"adjustment\" reformstook place without adjustment lending (as in Chileand Viet Nam), and some countries that receivedadjustment loans did little or nothing to pursuereforms (for example, Tanzania and Zambia). Inaddition, because a country's economic perfor-mance is affected by many factors, it is hard toisolate the part played by adjustment lending.Despite these difficulties, World Bank studies onthe impact of adjustment lending are revealing.The research looked at countries in the \"intensiveadjustment lending\" group (which includes coun-tries that received at least two structural adjust-ment loans or three sectoral adjustment loans by1990, with the first loan started by mid-1986) andfound that in general they did achieve fastergrowth than in other countries. All else beingequal, middle-income countries in the \"intensive\"group boosted their growth rates during 1986-90by an estimated average of about 4 percentagepoints a year over what would probably otherwisehave occurred. The low-income countries, espe-cially in Sub-Saharan Africa, did less well; forthem, the benefit was 2 percentage points.Since health is helped by economic recovery andfaster long-term growth, adjustment lending, byfacilitating economic progress, benefits health inthe long run. When a government has to adjustin response to economic shocks or to rectify mis-taken past policiesthe whole society, poor andnonpoor, may suffer short-run reductions in em-ployment and wages. But the resulting fall in in-come is caused not so much by policies associatedwith adjustment lending as by the necessity for thecountry to curb its consumption; without adjust-ment loans, even greater decreases in consump-tion would probably have been necessary. None-theless, adjustment lending can take five or moreyears to bear fruit, and the transition can be pain-ful because incomes may fall in the short run. Evi-dence from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin Americasuggests that economic downturns are associatedwith less favorable child mortality outcomes thanwould be predicted from long-term trends. Incountries where child mortality rates are decliningover time, for example, adjustment lending wouldbe associated, in the short run, with a slower rateof decline. To minimize such adverse effects, somecountries have begun to use resources, includingadjustment loans, to support nutrition programsfor vulnerable children, as well as basic health andother social services targeted to the poor. ADJUSTMENT LENDING AND PUBLIC EXPENDITUREON HEALTH. Because cuts in government spendingare usually central to an adjustment program,health spending is likely to be reduced. In manycountries early cuts were indiscriminate and failedto preserve those elements of the health systemwith the strongest long-term benefits for health.Drugs were often cut more heavily than personnelbecause it is difficult to lay off public employees.C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's experience illustrates the mistakesthat occurred in some early programs of economicadjustment. With real income per capita falling 19percent between 1980 and 1984, the governmentcut public spending, among other measures.Health expenditure dropped in real terms by 12percent between 1981 and 1984. But personnelcosts were not cut; instead public expenditures onmedicines and materials absorbed the reduction, 45Public spending on health recovered faster in countries that received adustnient lending.

In rural clinics,already precarious supplies of basic consumablesbecame even scarcer.The implications for child health looked grim.Cross-sectional data show that the nutritional sta-tus of Ivorian children is strongly related to theavailability of drugs in the community. All else be-ing the same, the difference in height-for-age (ameasure of long-run nutritional status) of childrenin communities lacking basic medicines and thosein well-supplied communities was equivalent tomore than one-third of the difference between theaverage child in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and in the UnitedStates. The health of children from poor familiessuffers even more when drugs are unavailable.Since 1990 the government has begun puttingmore resources into nonwage health inputs: theirshare of the health budget rose from 20 percent in1991 to 24 percent in 1993. Health services, par- 46ticularly in rural areas, have been improving as aresult.Various studies have assessed the effect of ad-justment programs on public spending on health.Most have found that central government expen-diture on health in countries with adjustmentlending programs did not suffer more than else-where; this result, however, is not definitive be-cause state and local governments are often re-sponsibleforasubstantialshareofpublicspending on health. More comprehensive dataavailable for twenty countries during 1980-90show that in both countries with and without ad-justment loans, public spending on health as apercentage of total country income declined in theearly 1980s in relation to the average for the dec-ade. In 1985-90, however, health spending recov-ered much faster in countries with adjustment pro-grams. Similarly, per capita public spending onhealth also recovered faster in such countries (Fig-ure 2.6). Unfortunately, the data are not goodenough to allow any judgment on whether adjust-ment programs directly helped to ensure that pub-lic spending on health was efficient. (And, as thisReport will show, not all health spending deservesto be protected; some of it isinefficient andregressive.)Expanding and improving schoolingIn general, developing countries have made muchprogress in expanding schooling since the 1960s,but the trends conceal some shortcomings. In thepoorest countries, especially in Africa, many chil-dren never go to school at all. In Mali, for example,fully 77 percent of all school-age children never goto schoola figure that has remained largely un-changed since 1980. Of those who do go to school,many often enroll latethus missing the benefitsof early learning opportunitiesand leave before Substantial male-female gaps in schooling persist in some low-income countries.they complete even the first few years of basic edu-cation. Fewer than 60 percent of first-graders inthe lowest-income countries and about 70 percentof those in the lower-middle-income countriesreach the last year of primary school.Enrollments are particularly low in isolated ruralareas, for lower socioeconomic groups, and forgirls. In developing countries as a group, about 10percent of boys ages 6-11 do not enroll; for girls inthe same age group the figure is 40 percent. Espe-cially in poor countries, the gaps can be substan-tial, as Figure 2.7 illustrates for India. But SriLanka's experience shows that this gender gap isnot an inevitable consequence of poverty.Leaving aside the gaps in enrollment, educationin many countries is inadequate. Even childrenwho complete primary school fail to acquire basicliteracy and numeracy skills and scientific under-standing. These weaknesses in the education sys-tem reduce the potential impact of schooling on Figure 2.7 Enrollment ratios in India, by grade, about 1980 Enrollment ratio (percent)100 80 60 40 20 0 D Boys0 Girls234Primary grades5678Middle grades Note: The enrollment ratio is the share of children in the age group corresponding to a given grade who are enrolledin that grade.Source: Tan and Mingat 1992. 479101112Secondary gradesBox 2.2Teaching schoolchildren about health: radio instruction in BoliviaMany personal habits and life-style choices that haveimportant consequences for health are formed early inlife. Health education in schools can help young peoplemake informed choices and so reinforce the effect ofschooling on health.Bolivia has had success with health educationthrough radio lessons. Radio instruction was first intro-duced in 1987 for teaching mathematics and proved tobe both inexpensive (with costs per pupil averagingless than $1 a year) and effective. In 1989 the health andeducation ministries began to try out the use of radiofor teaching disease prevention to schoolchildren,starting with a module on diarrhea prevention and oralrehydration. Children ages 8-13 were targeted becausethey often take care of younger siblings and performhousehold chores involving food preparation and sani-tation. They thus have a strong influence on their ownhealth and that of younger siblings. The radio healthprogram emphasizes actions that a child can do forhimself or herself or can do for or teach to a youngersibling. It rests on the belief that children who learnbasic health concepts and practices at a young age aremore likely to maintain them as parents.It is still too early to assess the long-term health im-pact of teaching health lessons through radio. None-theless, pupils already show significant gains in severalareas, including ability to recognize symptoms of dehy-dration and knowledge of the proper mixture and ap-plicationof homemade oral rehydration solution.There is also evidence of increased hand-washing, andmore households are using simple water filters.The radio program is now being expanded. In 1993more than 1,000 third- and fourth-grade classroomswill receive broadcasts of a new curriculum that in-cludes lessons on cholera, personal and dental hy-giene, acute respiratory infections, immunizations, in-fectious diseases, and accident prevention. Nutrition,environmental health, and self-esteem are to be addedin 1994. In response to parents' requests, a comple-mentary community-based radio program is also beingdeveloped and tested. health. More important, they also reduce parents'willingness to enroll their children, thus perpetu-ating a vicious cycle of poor schooling and poorhealth. In India, for example, more than 40 percentof parents in a nationwide survey cited either \"notinterested in education/further study\" or \"fail-ure\" as the main reason for not sending their chil-dren to school.Much more needs to be done to extend educa-tion in developing countries. Government supportfor schooling at the lower levels and for girls isespecially justified: the benefits for society arelarge, and poor families in low-income countriestypically undervalue the benefits of sending chil-dren to school or are unaware of them. In addi-tion, for such families the opportunity costs ofsending children to school are often high. A policypriority is to ensure that every child receives aminimum quantity of schoolingsay, 5,000 hours,or roughly six full years of schooling. This wouldbe consistent with the aims of the 1990 World Con-ference on Education for All, sponsored by theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cul-turalOrganization (UNESCO), UNICEF,theUNDP, and the World Bank. Most pupils in devel-oping countries currently receive much less than5,000 hours of schooling in the primary grades (be-cause of pupil and teacher absences caused bysickness, among other factors). In India no more 48than a third of girls reach this level, and in Chinaand Latin America only 60 percent do. Achieving5,000 hours of schooling for all children will thusrequire significant and sustained policy effort inlarge parts of the world. To reinforce the effects ofschool expansion on health, it may be useful toinclude health topics in school curricula (see Box2.2).Incomplete enrollments reflect the combined in-fluence of weak demand for education (which ispartly caused by low achievement) and inadequateschooling opportunities. To overcome these obsta-cles requires a combination of policies. Govern-ments can do more to ensure that lower levels ofschooling receive priority in the allocation of pub-lic spending. In some countries, current levels ofresources for primary schooling are insufficient tosupport even minimal conditions for instruction.In India public spending per primary pupil in rela-tion to income per capita averages only one-thirdthat in Korea, basically because much more of In-dia's public expenditure on education goes tohigher education. In Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauri-tania, and Niger one-quarter of the education bud-get is for higher education, and between 60 and 80percent of that quarter is devoted to scholarshipsand other forms of student aid. This, it can beargued, is inefficient, and it is also extremely re-gressive because most of the benefits of higher ed-ucation are captured privately in the form of in-creased earnings and because students tend tocome from higher-income families.On its own, spending more resources for pri-mary schools is not enough. Whatever is spentmust also be used efficiently.Although the health and nutrition of school-agechildren are not normally thought of as educationissues, in fact they do affect a child's school atten-dance and performance. Allocating resources toaddress health problems in this population can of-ten be an efficient way to improve schooling. (Spe-cific interventions are discussed in Chapter 4.)Teachers and pedagogical materials are the mainschool inputs at lower levels of schooling (withteacher salaries absorbing the bulk of spending).Efficient use of these inputs is thus crucial, par-ticularly in countries where rapid populationgrowth threatens to reverse progress in expandingenrollments. In Mauritania, for example, if spend-ing per pupil and the share of primary schooling intotal government expenditure remain constant,the enrollment ratio in primary schools is pro-jected to drop from 51 percent in 1988 to 45 percentby 2000. To forestall such regress, maximizing thelearning gain per unit cost and making the correcttradeoffs between unit costs and coverage are ofparticular importance. A recent World Bank-spon-sored review found expenditures on nonsalary in-puts such as textbooks and interactive radio in-struction to be most cost-effective in improvinglearning outcomes.In some circumstances it may also be right tospend more to lower the barriers to schooling forgirls and other disadvantaged groups. This can bedone in many ways: through scholarships (used inBangladesh to encourage girls to go to secondaryschool); by offering free textbooks or fee-exemp-tions; or by siting schools close to pupils' homes sothat parents are less worried about their daugh-ters' safety. In Pakistan, for example, girls are aslikely to enroll as boys when there is a school inthe village but are 10 percent less likely to do sowhen the school is nearby but not in the village. Inseveral African countries distance educationwhereby radio and correspondence materials re-place classroom teachers as the principal mediumof instructionhas sometimes helped to overcothethe physical barriers to schooling for girls. Empowering womenIn addition to education, other policies can en-hance women's capacity to improve their healthand that of their families. Removing discrimina-tionin the labor market, in access to credit, inproperty law, and so oncan boost women'searnings and financial security, which (as an ear-lier section has shown) can promote family health.And women need to be healthy themselves to ful-fil their roles as mothers and household managers.They have specific health needs, including protec-tion against violence. More than one-third of theglobal burden of disease for women ages 15-44,and over one-fifth of that for women ages 45-59, iscaused by conditions that afflict women exclu-sively (maternal mortality and morbidity and cer-vical cancer) or predominantly (anemia, sexuallytransmitted diseases,osteoarthritis, and breastcancer). Most of these problems can be addressedcost-effectively, but health services in many devel-oping countries have typically focused narrowlyon women as mothers.What islacking is a strategy for engagingwomen in health care from adolescence onward.Often this failing occurs because health servicesare insensitive to the cultural needs of women: inmany Middle Eastern countries, for example, mostphysicians are men, but there is a strong belief thatwomen should not be seen after puberty by menwho are not part of their family. Inconvenience isanother deterrent; in many countries individualhealth services (for example, prenatal care and im-munizations) are offered on different days, mean-ing that women have to return repeatedly withtheir children. The solution is often as feasible as itis clear: to provide child health services, prenatalcare, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases,and family planning services jointly at convenienttimes. The Bangladesh Women's Health Coalitionand the Chilean Institute of Reproductive Medi-cine, for example, offer integrated family planningservices at the same time as child health services,and Thailand is experimenting with mobile healthclinics to reach women in their homes.The design of health services must also be sensi-tive to the stigmas surrounding certain diseases,especially any that are sexually transmitted orphysically disfiguring. Women are more likely toseek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases ifhealth centers offer multiple services, with privacyin consultations, so that it is not obvious why aperson is visiting the center. Diseases that damagethe skin (such as leprosy, onchocerciasis, andleishmaniasis) have severe psychological implica-tions for girls and women, reduce their marriageprospects, and may lead to marital separation. InColombia and India women tend to seek treatment 49Box 2.3Violence against women as a health issueData from many industrial and developing countriesreveal that anywhere between one-fifth and more thanhalf of women surveyed say they have been beaten bytheir partners. Often, this abuse is systematic and dev-astating. In Papua New Guinea, for example, 18 per-cent of all urban wives surveyed had sought hospitaltreatment for injuries inflicted by their husbands. Inthe United States domestic violence is the leadingcause of injury among women of reproductive age; be-tween 22 and 35 percent of women who visit emer-gency rooms are there for that reason.Research has shown that battered women run twicethe risk of miscarriage and four times the risk of havinga baby that is below average weight. In some placesviolence also accounts for a sizable portion of maternaldeaths. In Matlab Thana, Bangladesh, for example, in-tentionalinjuryduring pregnancymotivated bydowry disputes or shame over a rape or a pregnancyoutside wedlockcaused 6 percent of all maternaldeaths between 1976 and 1986. Research from theUnited States indicates that battered women are four tofive times as likely to require psychiatric treatment asnonbattered women and are five times as likely to at-tempt suicide. They are also more prone to alcoholabuse,drugdependence,chronicpain,anddepression.Rape and sexual abuse also damage women's healthand are widespread in all regions, classes, and cul-tures. In Seoul 17 percent of women report being vic-tims of attempted or actual rape. In one study of U.S.women a history of rape or assault was a stronger pre-dictor of how many times women sought medical helpand of the severity of their health problems than was awoman's age or unhealthy habits (such as smoking). Inaddition to physical injury and emotional trauma, rapevictims run the risk of becoming pregnant or contract-ing sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Arape crisis center in Bangkok reports that 10 percent ofits clients contract STDs as a result of rape and 15 to 18percent become pregnant, a figure consistent with datafrom Korea and Mexico. In countries where abortion isrestricted or illegal, rape victims often resort to unsafeabortions, greatly increasing the danger of infertility oreven death.Another form of violence against women and girls isfemale genital mutilation, popularly known as femalecircumcision. An estimated 85 million to 114 millionwomen in the world today have experienced genitalmutilation. The practice is reported in twenty-six Afri-can countries, among minorities in India, Malaysia,and Yemen, and among some immigrant populationsin Western countries. If current trends continue, morethan 2 million girls will be at risk of genital mutilationevery year.Clitoridectomies account for 80 to 85 percent ofcases worldwide. Infibulation, which involves removalof more tissue, is more common in eastern Africa.These initiation rituals pose a health risk to girls andwomen and are a threat to their psychological, sexual,and reproductive well-being. The consequences ofboth procedures can include hemorrhage, tetanus, in-fection, urine retention, and shock. Infibulation carriesthe added risk of long-term complications because ofthe repeated cutting and stitching at marriage and witheach childbirth, and it can limit a woman's choice ofcontraceptive method. for leprosy later than men do, when patches havealready reached the face and hands; they are reluc-tant to ask for help when the first patches appear,on the buttocks. Again, sensitivity is needed toencourage women to come forward.The same is true of another category of dangerto women's health: domestic violence and rape.Violence against women is widespread in all coun-tries in which it has been studied (see Box 2.3).Although this has only recently been viewed as apublic health issue, it is a significant cause of fe-male morbidity and mortality, leading to psycho-logical trauma and depression, injuries, sexuallytransmitted diseases, suicide, and murder. Rapeand domestic violence cause a substantial androughly comparable level of disease burden percapita to women in developing and industrialcountries. These problems account for about 5 per- 50cent of the total disease burden among womenages 15-44 in developing countries, where the bur-den from maternal and communicable causes stilloverwhelms that from other conditions. In indus-trial countries, where the total disease burden ismuch smaller, this share rises to 19 percent. Bydamaging a woman's physical, mental and emo-tional capacity to care for her family, domestic vio-lence and rape also hurt the health of other familymembers, particularly young children.This is an issue with complex economic, cul-tural, and legal roots, and it is therefore not easilydealt with by public policies. Prevention will re-quire a coordinated response on many fronts. Inthe short to medium term, the right measures in-clude training health workers to recognize abuse,expanding treatment and counseling services, andenacting and enforcing laws against battering andrape. In the long term, much depends on changingcultural beliefs and attitudes toward violenceagainst women. In Africa women's groups haveworked to break the practice of female circumci-sion, partly by informing people of its severe con-sequences for health. In the United States theAmerican Medical Association launched a majorcampaign in 1991 to educate the public and physi-cians about family violence. Research shows thateven health professionals often fail to identifycases of battering. Recently, the U.S. Joint Com-mission on Hospital Accreditation issued newstandards requiring all hospitals to develop proto-cols and train their staffs to respond to differentforms of abuse. In Colombia the Ministry ofHealth has begun to document the scale of theproblem inits most recent Demographic andHealth Survey. These efforts come on the heels ofalmost two decades of organizing efforts bywomen around the world; in Latin America alonethere are now nearly 400 separate organizationsworking to reduce violence against women.What can be done?Around the world, much has already been done toenable people to live longer, healthier lives. Theachievements of the past point to the requirementsof the futureabove all, to economic growth andthe expansion of schooling and health services.According to World Bank projections, income percapita in Sub-Saharan African countries will growby only 0.8 percent a year over the next ten years.Even this modest increase will bring about a de-cline in the infant mortality rate of between 2 and 4percent. In South Asia, where faster growth-3.3percent a yearis projected, infant mortality de-clines of 15 percent can be expected.These benefits can be powerfully reinforced bybetter education and health services. In Africa in-creasing female literacy rates by 10 percent is likelyto lower the infant mortality rate by an estimated10 percent. In India and Kenya two maternaldeaths and about forty-five infant deaths would beaverted for every 1,000 girls provided with oneextra year of primary schooling. Even in poorcountries governments can enhance people's abil-ity to improve their own health by expandingschooling opportunities for all childrenwith spe-cial efforts to encourage parents to enroll theirdaughtersand by widening access to health ser-vices, particularly for women and children. Suchinvestments pay off in better health and provide afoundation for future economic growth. 51The roles of the government and the market in health World spending on health totaled about $1,700 bil-lion in 1990, or 8 percent of global income. Of this,governments spent more than $1,000 billion, ornearly 60 percent. Of the $170 billion spent onhealth in the developing countries of Africa, Asia,and Latin America, governments spent half thetotal amount-2 percent of those regions' GNP. Inthe established market economies, where totalhealth spending was almost $1,500 billion, govern-ments spent just over $900 billionmore than 5percent of GNP (Table 3.1). The sheer size of theseexpenditures on health makes it critical to under-stand the impact of government policies on peo-ple's health. But governments profoundly influ-ence health in less direct ways, through theirpolicies toward education, water supply, sanita-Table 3.1 Global health expenditure, 1990 52tion, and other sectors important for health, as well as through regulation of health systems,health providers, and insurers. Governments fur-ther affect health by their impact on householdincome and educational levels (as discussed inChapter 2), by financing public health services,and by providing care directly. What governmentsdo varies enormously from country to country, butevery government plays an important role.Three economic rationales justify and guide agovernment role in health. They are discussed ingreater detail in \"The rationales for governmentaction,\" below.The poor cannot always afford health carethat would improve their productivity and well-being.

For example, to satisfy special interestgroups, governments may adopt policies that re-duce the general welfare. Even when they choosecorrect policies, they may fail to implement themproperly.Governments have a responsibility to spendwell, to get \"value for money,\" whenever theydevote public resources to health. This means al-locating resources so as to obtain the most im-provement in health per public dollar, taking intoaccount the private market's response to publicsector spending. Because private health care mar-kets can also fail to achieve value for money, gov-ernment policy has a role in providing informationand incentives to improve the allocation of re-sources by the private sector. In most of the worlda great deal of additional health could be obtainedfrom a relatively small number of cost-effective in-terventions that could be delivered at modest costand with little need for high-level facilities ormedical specialties.Health expenditures and outcomesChapter 1 showed how greatly health status dif-fers among populations. Life expectancy rangesfrom forty years or less in some countries of Sub-Saharan Africa to seventy-five or more in the es-tablished market economies. In Sub-Saharan Af-rica half of all deaths occur under age 5; in theestablished market economies half occur after age74. Child mortality rates exceed 200 per 1,000 inseveral African countries but are below 20 in therichest countries. The burden of disease is fivetimes higher, per capita, in the worst-off than inthe healthiest regions.Three factors help to explain these huge differ-ences. The firstis human behavior. Chapter 2showed that both health and the capacity to im-prove health are related to income and educationand to the changes in behavior that wealth andeducation bring. The second factor is the amountand effectiveness of expenditure in the health sys-tem. The third factor is the range of diseases pre-sent, which is determined largely by climate andgeography. Effective health policy takes account ofdifferent disease prevalences but is not simply de-termined by them.Differences in health spending are an obviousstarting point in the search for an explanation ofdifferences in health. In 1990 total annual healthspending ranged from less than $10 per person inseveral African and Asian countries to more than$2,700 in the United States. There was also consid-erable variation within regions. In Africa, Tanzaniaspent only $4 per capita for health in 1990, whileZimbabwe spent $42 per person. In Asia, Ban-gladesh spent $7 per person each year, as against$377 in Korea. Since the share of GNP devoted tohealth tends to rise with income, rich countriesdiffer from poor ones even more in health expen-diture than in income.But health spending alone cannot explain all thevariation in health among countries. Nor can in-come and education, or even spending, income,and schooling taken together. Figure 3.1 illustratesthe discrepancies. The vertical axis shows how farlife expectancy in a country differs from the valuepredicted on the basis of that country's incomeand average schooling. France, Haiti, Singapore,and Syria have almost exactly the life expectancypredicted. China, Costa Rica, Honduras, and SriLanka, in the top half of the figure, all achieve fiveyears or more of life beyond what would be ex-pected. Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Uganda, theUnited States, and Zambia, in the bottom half ofthe figure, all have a life expectancy about fiveyears lower than expected, given their levels ofincome and education.The horizontal axis of Figure 3.1 shows how fartotal health spending differs from the value pre-dicted by income and education. Egypt, Morocco,Paraguay, Singapore, and Syria, in the left half ofthe figure, spend relatively little. France, Haiti, In-dia, Mozambique, and the United States, in theright half, spend more than expected.At any level of income and education, higherhealth spending should yield better health, all elsebeing equal. But there is no evidence of such arelation. Countries are scattered in all quadrants ofthe figure. The countries that appear in the upper-left quadrant obtain better health for less money.China, for instance, spends a full percentage pointless of its GNP on health than other countries atthe same stage of development but obtains nearly 53Health expenditure, income, and schooling only partly explain variation in life expectancy. 54Figure 3.1 Life expectancies and health expenditures in selected countries: deviationsfrom estimates based on GDP and schooling Deviation from predicted life expectancy (years) -10-50Singapore0 Syria.Greece 0 ..-% ten years of additional life expectancy.

(In the case of India health spend-ing is low and health status is poor, but even lowerspending and worse status would be expected fora country with such low levels of income andschooling.) Egypt and Zambia, by contrast, getpoor health for a lower-than-predicted level ofspending.

Thisraises obvious and important questions. What ac-counts for these large deviations? How much isattributable to the characteristics of health sys-tems? How can public policy help to provide betterhealth outcomes for a given national effort?The rationales for government actionPublic policy in health is successful if it leads toincreased welfare through better health outcomes,greater equity, more consumer outcome,higher expenditureCosta outcome, Zambia lower expenditure 123456 0 -4-3-2-1total cost than would occur in the absence of publicaction. Of course, the pursuit of one or more ofthese objectives does not by itself justify govern-ment intervention. There must be a basis for be-lieving that the government can achieve a betteroutcome than private markets can. There are threebroad reasons why that belief may be true: onecenters on poverty and the equitable distributionof health care and the other two involve marketfailures.Reduction or alleviation of poverty provides astraightforward rationale for public intervention inhealth. Success in reducing poverty requires twoequally important strategies: promoting the use ofthe most important asset of the poortheir laborand increasing their human capital through accessto basic health care, education, and nutrition. AsChapter 1 showed, investment in the health of thepoor raises their educability and productivity. Itgives them both the assets they need to lift them-selves from poverty and the immediate welfaregain of relief from physical suffering. Further-more, in most societies providing health and edu-cation for the poor commands a degree of politicalassent that is altogether lacking for transfers of in-come or of assets such as land. Investing in thehealth of the poor is an economically efficientand politically acceptable strategy for reducingpoverty and alleviating its consequences, as WorldDevelopment Report 1990 emphasized.If \"the poor\" are all those living on less than $1(in real purchasing power) per day, they can typ-ically neither afford much health care nor borrowto pay for it. Simply transferring small amounts ofincome to poor people would create relatively littleadditional demand for health care. But because thepoor are more sensitive to the price of medical careand also suffer a greater burden of disease than thenonpoor, access to free or low-cost care can pro-duce large increases in their consumption of healthcare.To ensure that subsidized health services actu-ally reach the poor, however, may require restric-tions, particularly on the kind of care that is paidfor by the public sector. Offering free care of allkinds to everybody typically leads to rationing ofservicesgeographically or according to quality.Such universal programs may not reach the pooror improve their health. They may, however, com-mand more political support than targeting, andthey more easily address the problems of insur-ance markets that are discussed below. Whoshould receive free care depends on the preva-lence of poverty and on the country's capacity tofinance care: spending more can translate intomore services for the poorest or the same servicesfor more people, including the less poor. In prac-tice, very poor countries must target if they are tooffer the poor any meaningful health care.Public goods and externalities are forms of marketfailure that may justify government intervention.The key characteristic of public goodswhich maybe products or servicesis that one individual canuse them or benefit from them without limitingothers' consumption or benefit. As long as some-body pays, everybody benefitswhich makes itdifficult or impossible to find anybody altruisticenough to pay. Many public health interventions,such as wide-area control of disease vectors andradio-based health information campaigns, arenearly pure public goods for which only the gov-ernment can ensure provision. Another publicgood, new scientific information, has contributedenormously to the rapid improvements in healthduring this century. Its continued creation will de-pend at least in part on governments. The rightchoice of interventions and the proper level of pro-vision of any public good require careful analysisof the health benefits in relation to the costs. Pricesprovide no indication of what benefits are worthbecause private markets do not supply publicgoods. Nonprofit nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) may supply such goods but cannot fullysubstitute for government action.Externalities, or spillovers of benefits or lossesfrom one individual to another, characterize casesin which a private market might function butwould produce too much or too little. For example,curing an individual of tuberculosis also preventstransmission of the disease. But an individual'sdemand to be cured of tuberculosis (or of mild orasymptomatic sexually transmitted disease) isprobably not affected by consideration of the riskto others. If the externality is not taken into ac-count, treatment will be priced too high in privatemarkets, and too little treatment will be given.Subsidies for treatment are therefore justified. Anexample of negative externalities is a person's useof antibiotics, which may, by increasing microbialresistance to a drug, reduce the drug's value toothers and increase their risks.Failures in markets for health care and health insur-ance provide a third rationale for government ac-tion to improve efficiency and, in the case of fail-ures in the market for health insurance, to improveequity. One source of market failure, \"adverse se-lection,\" arises because individuals face differentrisks. Customers who know themselves to be at 55high risk are motivated to buy more insurance andare more likely to use it. So it is in the insurer'sinterest to find out who the high-risk customersare and either to exclude them or to compensatefor their greater risk by charging them higher pre-miums. (Higher prices for all customers would re-duce demand by low-risk people and thereforepush prices still higher.) Defensive efforts to ob-tain valuable information about risks add to thecost of insured health care without improvinghealth outcomes.Adverse selection presents a serious problem forrisks existing at the time insurance is taken out,but an even more complex problem arises from thefact that an initially low-risk person may becomehigh-risk later in life. In principle, there should beinsurance available specifically against this likeli-hood of increased risk, or else insurance shouldcover a person's entire lifetime, with sharing ofrisks that may arise in the distant future, as well asof current ones. Neither solution is easy to imple-ment because of the extreme uncertainty; insur-ance can cover known risks but not uncertaintyabout risks.Another problem is the tendency of consumersto use more of a service when its marginal cost tothem decreases. Insurance reduces or eliminatesthe marginal cost of health care to consumers. So,providing insurance does not simply shift the waya given amount of health care is paid for but in-creases the amount of care demanded.Because the financial cost of disease is reduced,people may take less care of their health, leadingto more illness and more subsequent demand forcare. Or they may protect their health more byway of health care, paid for by insurance, and lessthrough their own behavior. Passing costs on toothers such as insurers because one does not bearthe full consequences of one's actions is called\"moral hazard.\" It arises because of uncertaintyand because insurers cannot fully monitor con-sumers' behavior and make them responsible fortheir decisions. Moral hazard also results whenproviders induce demand for services that neitherthey nor consumers will pay for.Both adverse selection and moral hazard havemore pernicious effects in markets for health in-surance than in markets for insurance on housesor cars. Risks to houses are higher in areas proneto earthquakes or hurricanes, but they are easy todetermine, and insurers respond by charginghigher premiums in those areas. Similarly, car in-surance premiums are higher for young driversand other identifiable groups at greater risk of ve-hicular accidents.56There is some moral hazard in the markets forhouse and vehicle insurance. The extreme form iswhen somebody burns down a house to collect theinsurance or abandons a car and reports it asstolen. But unlike consumption of too much healthcare, these actions are crimes, with penalties thatmay greatly exceed the value of the asset. In anycase, the insurer's potential liability is limited tothe (easily determined) market value of the asset.All the limitations on moral hazard and adverseselection are weaker in health insurance. It isharder to identify individual risks, and still harderto attribute them to behavioral choices. There is nomarket value for the human body and no possi-bility of abandoning one that is worn out and ac-quiring a new one. The lack of a natural limit oncosts (since the asset being insured, the body, hasno price with which costs can be compared) distin-guishes health from other insurable risks.The difficulties in insurance markets carry overdirectly into markets for health care. If people have\"too much\" health insurance, they will have anincentive to use \"too much\" health care at toohigh prices. Unfortunately the difficulty of judginghealth care risks and the impossibility of placing avalue on a living body make it impossible to deter-mine how much is \"too much\" in health care andhealth insurance. Nor is making a consumer paymore for health care a sure way of reducing only\"unnecessary\" demand.Failuresof information make matters evenworse. A patient who knew the likely outcomeand the cost to him or her of every possible treat-ment might yet be able to choose rationally be-tween gains and costs. But patients do not havesuch knowledge, and the medical professionalgenerally knows far more than the customer. Thisasymmetry of information means that the providernot only provides services but also decides whatservices should be provided. The result is a poten-tial conflict of interest between what the providerstands to gain from selling more services and hisor her duty to do what is best for the patient. Thepatient is at even more of a disadvantage whensick and unable to make decisions or when deci-sions must be made quickly because of threats tolife.The same potential for consumption of unneces-sary services can arise any time a supplier is betterinformed than a customer. It is a notorious prob-lem in car repair and home improvement services.But in these sectors the insurer has more oppor-tunity to supervise the service provider, and theinsurer may decide simply to replace the itemrather than to repair it. Health insurers have noreplacement option. They may try to review pro-fessionals' recommendations before agreeing topay for services, but health professionals often dis-agree about expected medical outcomes, and wait-ing for a second opinion may cause pain, suffer-ing, and increased risk for the patient.These problems constitute the market failure pe-culiar to health: expenditure on medical care canbe extremely high, yet not all justified care is pro-vided and much care of doubtful value is paid for.Some people are denied insurance, while othersmay be overprotected. Those who do not pay thefull costs of treatment may take poorer care of theirown health than they could. Many of the extracosts are paid by society as a whole.The market for health care goods and servicescan also fail through imperfect competition amongproviders, which allows excess profits, inefficientuse of resources, poor quality, and too little pro-duction. Sometimes governments themselves arti-ficially stifle competition. For example, govern-ments may prohibit or interfere unduly with theoperation of private health care providers, particu-larly NGOs. Governments often also protect do-mestic producers of drugs and vaccines. In Ban-gladesh tetanus vaccine produced domestically atgovernment insistence had such low potency thatits use in 1989-92 risked thousands of lives beforeit was replaced with imported vaccine.Economies of scale in productionwhich occurwhen a single large producer is much more effi-cient than many small onesalso lead to noncom-petitive situations. In many parts of the world hos-pitals and specialists face little or no competitionbecause of economies resulting from large-scaleoperation. Such situations may call for regulationof the private market.The three rationales for government interven-tion in the health sectorprovision of publicgoods, reduction of poverty, and market failurecorrespond roughly to three different kinds of ser-vices. First, the services classified as public goods,and some of those characterized by large exter-nalities,constitute what is known as \"publichealth.\" Public health includes those services pro-vided to the population at large or to the environ-ment, such as spraying to control malaria. It alsotypically includes some services such as immun-zations that are not public goods but that carrysubstantial externalities.Second, the inclusion of health care as part of astrategy for combating poverty justifies public fi-nancing of \"essential\" clinical or individual ser-vices. These are highly cost-effective services thatwould greatly improve the health of the poor.Since poor people typically cannot buy such carefor themselves, there is a straightforward case forpublic finance. Public health measures and essen-tial clinical care together constitute a package ofhealth care that might justifiably be financed bygeneral revenues, with perhaps some contributionfrom user fees. This strategy is also compatiblewith the argument that basic health care is a fun-damental right. Although most of the populationmay be able to pay for such care, the governmenthas a responsibility to ensure that the poor, too,can exercise their rightat least to the extent thatsociety can afford.Third, the rationale that the government shouldintervene in health care markets because of signifi-cant market failures applies particularly to the reg-ulation of health care and health insurance. Thegovernment cannot finance all medical care forwhich insurance might be desirable without wors-ening the tendency toward higher costs and risk-ing de facto rationing of health care, which par-ticularly hurts the poor. Beyond a well-definedpackage of essential services, therefore, the role ofthe government in clinical services should be lim-ited to improving the capacity of insurance andhealth care markets to provide discretionary carewhether through private or through social insur-ance (earmarked taxes such as social security orother mandated arrangements). Of course, therange of services included in the nationally de-fined essential package will vary substantiallyfrom country to country. To provide equitable ac-cess for the poor, to address problems of adverseselection, and to contain costs, the governments ofalmost all OECD countries have made available acomprehensive essential package with public (orpublicly mandated) financing. Poorer countriesmust, of necessity, define their essential packagesmore narrowly.Governments can further improve how marketsfunction by providing information about the cost,quality, and outcome of health care. Simply by de-fining an essential clinical package, the public sec-tor provides valuable guidance on what is andwhat is not cost-effective. This distinction maythen influence the design of private or social insur-ance packages and the behavior of individual pro-viders or patients. Information on the relative cost-effectiveness of different discretionary proceduresis similarly valuable and might be used by insurersand providers to reduce costs and attract clients.Neither theory nor experience points to a gen-eral rule on the extent to which the public sectorshould provide health care directly, as distinctfrom financing it. Governments might have to57Box 3.1Paying for tuberculosis control in ChinaTuberculosis kills or debilitates more adults than anyother single infectious agent. Without appropriatetreatment, 60 percent of those with the full-blown dis-ease will die. In China, itis estimated, more than360,000 peoplemost of them poor peasantsdie oftuberculosis every year. Tuberculosis is best preventedby curing infectious persons early in the course of dis-ease, thus interrupting transmission to others. Well-run programs can cure 80 to 90 percent of patients;poorly administered programs cure 30 percent or less,leading to larger numbers of sustained cases of infec-tion and related deaths and to new infections.China made substantial progress against tuber-culosis during the 1960s and 1970s, using standardlong-term (twelve to eighteen months) antibiotic ther-apy that was essentially free of charge. Since the early1980s, however, infection rates in about half the coun-try's provinces have stagnated or increased, despitethe adoption of an improved short-course (six to eightmonths) therapy. Much of the trend is attributable tochanged health-financing policies and, in particular, tothe government's decision that health facilities shouldbe encouraged to charge patients for virtually all ser-vices. Starting in 1981, health institutions had to earnmuch of their operating costs from sales of drugs andservices. Although base salaries were still funded fromthe public budget, workers' bonuses, housing, and re-tirement benefits depended in part on institutional in-come from service provision. Managers' investmentbudgets were also linked to revenues from fees. A fewpublic health services such as immunizations remainedpartially subsidized, but tuberculosis diagnosis andtreatment were not, despite drug costs of $30 to $80 pertreatment. supply a package of essential health services di-rectly where private care would not be feasiblewithout high subsidiesfor example, in lightlypopulated, very poor areas. (In many parts of thedeveloping world an alternative method of provid-ing such services is to subsidize an NGO.) In mostcircumstances, however, the primary objective ofpublic policy should be to promote competitionamong providersincluding between the publicand private sectors (when there are public pro-viders),as well as among private providers,whether nonprofitorfor-profit.CompetitionSshould increase consumer choice and satisfactionand drive down costs by increasing efficiency.Government supply in a competitive setting mayimprove quality or control costs, but noncompeti-tive public provision of health services is likely tobe inefficient or of poor quality. 58In some circumstances market failure may im-pose only slight welfare losses, and the benefit ofcorrecting it may be outweighed by the costs ofgovernment action. In other cases the losses fromfailure to take account of positive externalities andsupplier-induced demand can be enormous. Pol-icy toward tuberculosis control in China providesan example: elimination of some free health careand introduction of profit incentives in the provi-sion of health services dramatically reduced treat-ment rates, reversing progress against the diseaseand causing much needless suffering (Box 3.1).Failures of government intervention can arise, how-ever, even when government action might besound policy.Governments may misjudge how an interven-tion will work in practice. Governments have onlypartial control over how private actors respond,Charging tuberculosis patients had perverse effects.When doctors and institutions expected to be reim-bursed by insurance, they provided excessive diagnos-tic tests and examinations during treatment and dis-pensed higher-cost antibiotics that should have beenreserved for the most resistant cases. Daunted by thecosts, many low-income victims failed to enter treat-ment or dropped out early. There were no incentives toensure that patients completed treatment or werecured. Because health system records showed veryhigh rates of cure for those who completed treatment,the government remained largely unaware of the dete-riorating situation. The direct cost to the health systemof a poorly functioning program was nil, but the indi-rect costs to the economyand the personal costs topatients and their familieswere enormous.An estimated I million to 1.5 million additional tu-berculosis cases remained infectious during the 1980sbecause treatment was no longer free. Tens of millionsof new infections were produced, and many of thoseinfected will fall victim to the disease later in life.The development of drug-resistant strains was also ac-celerated. Given appropriate policies, many of themore than 3 million persons who died of tuberculosisin China during the decade could have been saved,and the risk of infection for society could have beenhalved.China, having recognized the problems caused bycharging for tuberculosis therapy, has begun a majornational tuberculosis-control effort that provides sub-sidies for treatment and appropriate incentives for pro-viders of care. Early results of this policy show dra-matic increases in the number of cases cured.-Iand those responses can undermine the intendedobjective. Since 1971 physicians' fees in all pro-vinces of Canada have been set by negotiationwith provincial governments, and fees are nolonger rising faster than the general price level. Toprotect their incomes, particularly during the infla-tionary period 1971-75, physicians carried out agreater number of procedures. This reaction wasstrongest where real fees fell the most. The savingin government expenditure was therefore muchless than had been anticipated.Governments may not have the capacity toadminister or implement policies well. Indeed,they may suffer from corruption and from sheerincompetence. The examples of two donor-financed public hospitals, each with 500 to 600beds, in two Latin American countries illustratethe problem. One was simply too large to adminis-ter and operate and therefore could not be used atmore than 60 percent of capacity. The other was sobadly designed that it could not accommodatemore than one-third the planned number ofpatients.Governments are vulnerable to special inter-ests both within and outside the health system. Byfinancing the training of unneeded physicians, bypaying for low-value discretionary services for bet-ter-off patients, and by protecting domestic indus-tries, governments help create the interests thatlater impede good policy, especially when quickresponses are needed to meet changing circum-stances or new opportunities. Even when societyas a whole would gain, public action may fail be-cause it does not overcome the resistance of thosewho would lose as a result.Perhaps the most fundamental problem facinggovernments is simply how to make choices abouthealth care. Too often, government policy has con-centrated on providing as much health care as pos-sible to as many people as possible, with too littleattention to other issues. If governments are tofinance a package of public health measures andclinical services, there must be a way to choosewhich services belong in the package and whichwill be left out. (The next section describes a mea-sure of cost-effectiveness for health interventionsthat helps with this choice.) If financing is publicbut provision is private, governments must decidehow to subsidize private care. The question of in-centives to providers raised by that issue also ap-plies to paying for publicly provided careto the\"internal market\" in the public sector. And if gov-ernments are to influence the market for discre-tionary services, they must decide what instru-ments are most appropriate for affecting thebehavior of insurers, providers, and patients. Thisraises the question of how far the governmentshould itself act as an insurer, through social insur-ance, and how far it should regulate private in-surers. Each of these decisions involves tradeoffsamong the objectives of health policy: betterhealth outcomes, lower costs, more equity, andgreater consumer satisfaction with the health sys-tem as a whole and with individual care.Value for money in healthNo matter how health services are organized andpaid for, what they actually provide are health in-terventions: specific activities meant to reduce dis-ease risks, treat illness, or palliate the conse-quences of disease and disability. Debates aboutwhether health services should concentrate on\"vulnerable groups\" such as children, pregnantwomen, or the elderly, or about the relative rolesof hospitals versus health centers, or about pre-ventive versus curative activities, are at bottom de-bates concerning the proper mixture of interven-tions. In health, as in every other sector, customerswant value for the money spent on such interven-tionswhether they pay directly or indirectly, intheir roles as taxpayers or as buyers of healthinsurance.Knowing the cost-effectiveness of a health inter-ventionthe net gain in health (compared withdoing nothing) divided by the costcan be ex-tremely useful for both public and private deci-sions. Governments can generate such informa-tion, and they can use it in two ways. First, theycan use it in determining whether a particular pub-lic sector intervention is cost-effective: this meansjudging the improvement in health compared withwhat would have happened through private deci-sions in the absence of public action. (Chapter 4addresses these issues for public health measuresand Chapter 5 for the public finance of essentialclinical services.) Second, they can supply infor-mation about the outcomes and costs of differenthealth interventions to consumers, providers, andinsurers, and this knowledge can increase thevalue per health dollar spent in the private sector,including what is spent on discretionary services.Private providers have no more incentive thanpublic providers to measure health outcomes, butthey do face greater incentives to know their costs.Cost information alone can promote allocative effi-ciency, as the experience of a Brazilian nonprofitmaternal and child hospital demonstrates (Box 59Box 3.2Cost information and management decisions in a Brazilian hospitalThe Instituto Materno-Infantil de Pernambuco (IMIP) isa private, nonprofit hospital founded in 1960 to servethe metropolitan area of Recife. In 1992 it received thefirst UNICEF award to a \"child-friendly\" hospital inBrazil in recognition of its work, particularly in the pro-motion of breastfeeding. IMIP depends for 95 percentof its revenue on contracts from the Instituto Nacionalde Assist\u00eancia M\u00e9dica e Previd\u00eancia Social spending runsabout $6 million.Starting in 1989, IMIP organized an accounting sys-tem that divides services according to eleven cost cen-ters for final output. Administrative, laundry, food, ra-diology,laboratory,transport, and other nonfinalservices were assigned to these final outputs in propor-tion to their measured or estimated use.IMIP must match its average costs to average reve-nues determined by the price schedule of INAMPS,which is organized by treatment groups rather than byindividual services. Losses in any cost center must beoffset by surpluses elsewhere. Gravely ill children arereferred to the hospital from all over northeast Brazil,and there are three infant deaths per day among them. Lbreduce mortality, IMIP created a pediatric intensivecare unit. The treatments provided, however, costmuch more than INAMPS would pay. And mortalitydid not decline. Even without cost-effectiveness calcu-lations, it was evident that closing the intensive careunit (except for newborns) and strengthening otherservices would save a greater number of children'slives. In particular, since the children who died in thehospital typically arrived very sick and often severelymalnourished, it appeared more cost-effective to try tofind high-risk children and treat them earlier. The strat-egy used was to expand the network of small commu-nity health posts in the slum neighborhoods of Recife.IMIP opened the first such posts in 1983; by 1986 infantmortality in those neighborhoods had fallen from 147to 101 per 1,000 births.The experience of IMIP illustrates three lessonsabout cost-effective delivery of essential care. One isthat allocative efficiency can be improved without com-plete information: medical professionals know muchabout outcomes and often need only to know moreabout costs. A second lesson is that autonomy facili-tates such changes: since private facilities generallyhave much more autonomy than public ones, this is anargument for more public finance of private provisionor for decentralization of public systems. The third les-son is that even prices that are not based Ofl cost-effec-tiveness criteria can guide decisions about what care toprovide. It is more useful for government to set thoseprices correctly than to try to make all the allocativechoices. 3.2). By estimating costs for \"cost centers\" andrelating them to outputs, the hospital discoveredthat its pediatric intensive care unit would drainresources from other departments, given theprices the government paid for various services.The decision was made to limit the intensive careunit to newborns; community-level health postsappeared more cost-effective for other cases.Measuring the cost-effectiveness of health interventionsGiven a common currency for measuring cost anda unit for measuring health effects, different inter-ventions can be compared by what it costs toachieve one additional year of healthy life. Out-comes are measured in the same unit of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) used to estimate theburden of disease. Nonhealth burdens, such as in-come lost because of disease, are not included inthe measure. The ratio of cost and effect, or theunit cost of a DALY, is called the cost-effectivenessof the intervention; the lower that number, thegreater the value for money offered by the inter-vention. This approach avoids assigning a dollar60value to human life, as would be necessary if costsand gains were to be put in the same units.Only in the past decade have costs and effective-ness been systematically estimated for a widerange of health care interventionsalthough thefirst such calculations had been made many yearsearlier. Only a small share of the thousands ofknown medical procedures has been analyzed, butthe approximately fifty studied would be able todeal with more than half the world's disease bur-den. Just implementing the twenty most cost-effective interventions could eliminate more than40 percent of the total burden and fully three-quar-ters of the health loss among children.The cost and effectiveness estimates used in thisReport are based, as far as possible, on actual con-ditions in developing countries. Some fixed costsof operating a health system that cannot be attrib-uted to particular interventions are not consid-ered, but the costs of intervention-specific capacityare taken into account. Costs are assessed at mar-ket prices. For inputs that cannot be traded inter-nationally (such as semiskilled labor), costs will belower in developing countries. For drugs, mostI I Iequipment, and high-level manpower, costs arelikely to be equal across countries, leaving asidethe effects of tariffs or other barriers. Indirectcosts, such as patients' costs of travel to treatmentor the income they forgo, can be substantial forsome interventions and perhaps particularly forwomen. Because these costs are difficult to deter-mine, they were largely ignored; more study isneeded of how these barriers affect the utilizationof health services.For some common health service packages suchas immunizations, costs are computed on a jointbasis rather than separately for each interventionin the package. The estimates do not represent anunattainable ideal; they assume that medically cor-rect procedures are followed and that reasonablecare is taken as to quality, but they also allow forincomplete coverage or compliance. Wheneverpossible, actual experience is used to guide esti-mates of such things as how many patients will failto complete a course of treatment. Future gainsfrom current interventions are discounted at 3 per-cent per year, which has little effect on the rankingof interventions the effects of which are feltquickly, although it does reduce measured gainsfrom interventions when the health effects are feltonly in the long run.This Report found huge differences in both thecost and the effectiveness of various health inter-ventions. Figure 3.2 presents both dollar costs andgains in DALYs for each of forty-seven differentinterventions. Higher points represent interven-tions that are more effective in improving health;points farther to the right represent lower-cost in-terventions. Some interventions cost more than$10,000 per person benefited, while others costless than $1. Some interventions add more thanten years of healthy life; for others the gain isequivalent to only a few hours or days of fullhealth. Both axes are scaled in logarithms so thatthe diagonal lines show equal cost-effectivenessratios in dollars per DALY. These ratios varywidely, from as little as $1 to as much as $10,000.Higher lines represent more cost-effective inter-ventions. Four specific interventions illustrate ex-treme combinations of cost and health gain: vita-min A supplementation in areas where the risk ofblindness from vitamin deficiency is high (verylow cost, high gain), chemotherapy for tuber-culosis (high cost, very high gain), environmentalcontrol of dengue (low cost, low gain), and treat-ment of childhood leukemia (very high cost, mod-erately high gain).Because interventions can differ so much in cost-effectiveness, making allocative decisions badly ineither the public or the private sector costs lives.An expenditure of $100,000 on chemotherapy fortuberculosis could directly save about 500 patients.It would also prevent them from infecting others,for a total gain of about 35,000 DALYs. The sameexpenditure on management of diabetes wouldalso benefit 500 patients but would save only 400DALYs; each patient would gain less than onehealthy year from a year of treatment, and therewould be no benefit from reducing incidence. In-sisting on value for money is not only fully con-sistent with compassion for the victims of disease,it is the only way to avert needless suffering.The results of cost-effectiveness analysis confirmthe value of the primary health care interventionsincluded in programs to reduce childhood malnu-trition and mortality, chiefly from infectious dis-eases. Several hitherto neglected interventions arealso very cost-effective: chemotherapy against tu-berculosis, integrated prenatal and delivery care,mass programs to deworm children, provision ofcondoms along with information and education tocombat AIDS, and measures against smoking,such as education, consumer taxes on tobaccoproducts (an effective deterrent for adolescentswho are not yet addicted), and prohibition ofsmoking in public places. Many of the most cost-effective health interventions are preventive incharacter. But not all preventive measures are cost-effective: spraying to control the mosquitoes thatcarry dengue is an example of relatively poor valuefor money. At the same time, a small number ofneglected but cost-effective clinical (mostly cura-tive) interventions could eliminate a substantialfractionof the burden ofdiseasein manycountries.In general, most cost-effective interventions canbe performed outside hospitals. By treating a smallnumber of severe cases of disease, however, hos-pitals can sometimes improve health at a lowercost per DALY than lower-level facilitiespro-vided that clinics or health posts treat most casesand refer to hospitals only those requiring moresophisticated care. Complications in the use of cost-effectivenessBoth the cost and the effectiveness of an interven-tion can be affected by the incidence and preva-lence of the disease and the probability of dyingfrom it. Preventive interventions are less cost-effective for relatively rare diseases because morepeople have to be reached to prevent one case. Thefatality rate matters because preventing or control-ling a disease saves more lives if there is a high61The costs and effectiveness of health interventions vary greatly.

Immunization in an environ-ment in which children are undernourished andmany die from preventable diseases is more cost-effective than if children are otherwise healthy andface little risk of dying. (Box 3.3, on measles andtuberculosis, illustrates these issues.) Fortunately,differences in cost-effectiveness between one in-tervention and another are often much larger thaneither the variation from one locale to another orthe uncertainty in the estimates. Where this is notthe case, as exemplified by malaria, detailed local 62information is needed to judge which interven-tions should have priority. National or regional as-sessments are also important for estimating theexpenditure levels required and the probable im-pact on the national burden of disease.If providing an intervention did not impose anyfixed costs in infrastructure and program adminis-tration, then a low cost per DALY saved wouldsuffice to justify the intervention. In practice, theremay be substantial fixed costs to share over a num-ber of interventions, and administrative capacityThe costs and effects of measles vaccination were esti-mated for a model urban area based on data fromLagos and Kinshasa. Data from Matlab, Bangladesh,were used to model measles in rural areas. In eacharea, 36,400 cases of measles were assumed to occur inthe absence of vaccination, with 1,452 urban deathsand 806 rural deaths. All the health damage from mea-sles comes from deaths, each of which costs thirtyDALYs. The simulations considered three differentstrategies:no vaccination,immunizationatninemonths (the earliest age at which the standard vaccineis effective) with 60 percent coverage, and nine-monthvaccination plus efforts to increase coverage to 80 per-cent, which raises supervision costs by 10 percent. Forthe last strategy, incremental as well as average costswere calculated to highlight the effect of raising cover-age. Costs were related to each of three effects: casesaverted, deaths averted, and DALYs gained. Box table3.3 shows the results.Measles strikes later in childhood in rural areas, socases are easier to prevent. But because earlier cases (inurban areas) cause more deaths, the cost per deathaverted or per DALY is higher. In both urban and ruralareas, the marginal cost of raising coverage exceeds the Box table 3.3 Health costs and gains from measles immunizationaverage cost of the lower-coverage strategy, but thehigher-coverage approach continues to be extremelycost-effective. Similar calculations were made for che-motherapy for tuberculosis, for both a standard courseof treatment (twelve to eighteen months) and a shortcourse (six to eight months), each with and withouthospitalization. Using data from Malawi, Mozam-bique, and Tanzania, the average incremental cost(marginal cost plus the average cost attributable to thefixed costs of the tuberculosis control program but ex-cluding other fixed costs of the health system) was esti-mated at about $80 to $110 per cure for ambulatorytreatment, and $160 to $300 when hospitalization wasrequired. Cost per death directly averted was in therange of $75 to $275, but cost per total death averted,taking account of the interruption of transmission, canbe as low as $20 and never exceeds $100. These verylow costs translate into costs per DALY saved of about$1 to $3, making chemotherapy for tuberculosis one ofthe most cost-effective of all interventions. These costsdo not vary with the annual rate of infection. The cost-effectiveness of BCG vaccine, by contrast, is extremelysensitive to infection rates; the vaccine is cost-effectiveonly when the risk of infection is high. may be limited. Spending on interventions thatare very cost-effective but resolve very small dis-ease burdens could waste resources by making itdifficult to deal with diseases that impose muchlarger burdens. Priority should go to those healthproblems that cause a large disease burden and forwhich cost-effective interventions are available(Box 3.4). If a particular health problem causes theloss of many healthy life years but there are nomeansor only very costly meansfor dealingwith it, then it should be a priority not for healthcare but for research on development of cost-effec-tive interventions.Since only relative ranking is possible, the at-tractiveness of an intervention also varies accord-ing to what other health problems and treatmentsare locally prevalent. Oral rehydration therapy isan example: in environments in which child mor-tality is low, it is much less cost-effective than im-munization because it may have to be given re-peatedly during a child's first few years, but asmortality rises it becomes more cost-effective. Ingeneral, the cost-effectiveness ratio varies not onlywith local conditions but also with the degree towhich an intervention penetrates or covers apopulation. Cost-effectiveness is also influenced 63Urban, by percentage vaccinated Rural, hr percentage vaccinatedItem 60 8060 80Cases prevented (thousands) 10.7 14.216.2 22.6 Total cost per case prevented (dollars) 17 1811 12 Incremental cost (dollars)- 22- 15Deaths averted (thousands) 0.4 0.60.4 0.5 Total cost per death averted (dollars) 432 462525 561 Incremental cost (dollars) 552 670DALYs gained (thousands) 12.3 16.410.2 13.5 Total Cost per DALY (dollars) 15 1618 19 Incremental cost (dollars)- 19- 23Source: Foster, McFarland, and measles and 3.4Priority health problems: high disease burdens and cost-effective interventionsIt is easy to determine which health problems amongchildren under age 5 deserve priority. As Appendixtable B.6 shows, nine diseases each account for morethan 1 percent of the total disease burden in this agegroup. These diseases range from acute respiratory in-fections (more than 17 percent in both boys and girls)to iodine deficiency (1.2 to 1.3 percent). Of these prob-lems, which cause fully 80 percent of young children'sill health, eight can be addressed by interventions cost-ing less than $100 per DALY saved. The only exceptionis congenital problems, which are responsible for morethan 6 percent of the disease burden but for which nocost-effective interventions are known.The situation is much more complicated for adults(Appendix table B.7). For example, cerebrovasculardisease is the leading cause of healthy life years lost inboth sexes after age 60 and in women ages 45-59, butinterventions to deal with it cost $1,000 or more perDALY saved. Ischemic heart disease is the second orthird leading cause of ill health in both sexes after age45, but the cost per DALY of dealing with it is $250 to$1,000. Among the ten principal noncommunicablecauses of ill health in this age group, interventionscosting less than $100 per DALY saved exist only forcataracts, anemia, and cancers of the respiratory sys-tem (through reduction of smoking) and the cervix.These problems account for only 7.9 percent of the dis-ease burden in women ages 45-59 and for smallershares in other age and sex groups. Among communi-cable diseases tuberculosis, AIDS, and respiratory in-fections deserve priority, but they cause less than 10percent of all ill health after age 45 and only 20.1 per-cent in men ages 15-44.Large disease burdens and cost-effective interven-tions coincide for only one group of adults, womenages 15-44. Six of the ten main sources of ill health canbe prevented or treated for less than $100 per DALY.These range from maternal health problems (18.0 per-cent of the burden) to respiratory infections and ane-mia (2.5 percent of the burden each) and account intotal for 44 percent of ill health among women of repro-ductive age. Two other problemsdepression and self-inflicted injuryeach cause at least 3 percent of thedisease burden, but dealing with them is much moreproblematic.These calculations illustrate the chief problem ahealth care system faces as the population ages: themarginal cost of a year of healthy life gained risessharply, leading to difficult choices between increasedspending and lower health gains. However, manyhealth problems of the elderly that cannot be fully re-solved may be palliated at low cost. And much can bedone at earlier ages to improve the health of futuregenerations of old people.I by the presence of other interventions that mightaffect costs (through sharing of joint costs) or out-comes. Sometimes combining two interventions,one preventive and one curative, is the appropri-ate way to deal with a particular disease, as is thecase for tuberculosis and malaria. Some treatmentfor malaria is necessary because preventive mea-sures do not protect everyone; even if treatment ismore costly, both interventions should be applied.In exceptional circumstances it may be worthpaying high marginal costs to extend coverage ofan intervention to the entire population becausethe disease can be eradicated permanently (as hasoccurred with smallpox and may now be possiblewith polio). The gains in such cases include notonly the DALYs saved at the margin from the lastpeople immunized but all the healthy years thatwould otherwise be lost to the disease in thefuture. A similar argument holds if a low-costintervention that has to be applied continuallyisreplaced by one with large initialcostsbut permanent effects, such as sanitation to reducethe need for treating many fecally borne diseases. 64An important limitation on the use of cost-effec-tiveness analysis of resource allocation in health isthat a number of interventions with importanthealth consequences also affect income or welfarein other ways. Chemotherapy for tuberculosis hasno value beyond the DALY gain associated withcuring tuberculosis, but investing in girls' school-ing has both important consequences for health(as documented in Chapter 2) and for income andstatus later in life. Similarly, family planning, inaddition to its health benefits, permits familychoice about the number and spacing of children;improved water supply and sanitation create ame-nity and time-saving benefits; increased food con-sumption allows higher levels of physical activity;and improved road safety reduces property dam-age and saves lives. For some of these interven-tions (for example, family planning and girls'schooling) the cost per DALY is sufficiently low tomake them attractive on health grounds alone;other benefits only strengthen the case. For otherinterventions the cost per DALY gained may betoo high to justify investment on health groundsalone, but consumer willingness to pay for non-health benefits means that costs to the health sys-tem can be low. Many water and sanitation invest-ments are in this category.Using cost-effectiveness to select health inter-ventions for public financing does not necessarilymean spending the most resources where the bur-den of disease is greatest. Instead, it means con-centrating on the interventions that offer the great-est possible gain in health per public dollar spent.The relevant comparison is usually not with a situ-ation in which nothing is done but with the situa-tion created by privately financed health interven-tions. The most justified public measures willtherefore combine a strong rationale for public ac-tion with a cost-effective health intervention. Be-cause individuals differ in how they value thepresent in relation to the future and in how theyjudge the seriousness of different health condi-tions, a uniform ceiling on what the governmentpays to gain one DALY may leave some peoplewith more publicly financed care than they wouldchoose and some with less. But of all possible uni-form criteria by which to judge what interventionsto pay for, cost-effectiveness appears to yield themost efficient distribution of health resources.Data limitationsCost-effectiveness analysis requires data on expen-ditures for particular interventions and on out-comesinformation that health facilities and sys-tems,particularly those in the public sector,typically do not collect. Such information couldpromote substantial gains in efficiency, but it willtake considerable time and effort for most publicsystems in developing countries to learn how togather and use it. Budgets often disaggregate onlyby inputs, not by programs, and costs per consul-tation or per bed-day mix many different interven-tions. Outcomes are seldom quantified. For inter-ventions the cost-effectiveness of which varygreatly with local conditions, there is no substitutefor information on both costs and results.Health policy and the performance of healthsystemsAll governments subscribe to the view that thestate must ensure the provision of certain basicpublic health services. But few achieve this goaleven for immunization, which is probably thehealth intervention that has received the greatestgovernment attention and donor support and thathas the most easily measured output. Coverage inmany regions remains incomplete. Immunizationagainst measles and against diphtheria, pertussis,and tetanus has reached 90 percent or more inChile, China, Cuba, Korea, and Saudi Arabia, butit is still below 50 percent in some Asian and manySub-Saharan African countries. Many of the othercomponents of an adequate public health packagescarcely exist.As far as clinical services are concerned, theprincipal government failing in most countries isthe attempt to provide everything to everybody,with no distinction between more and less essen-tial care and more or less needy patients. For somehealth services provided by the public sector, thesystem of provision is so grossly inefficient that itis unlikely to be cost-effective no matter what in-terventions the system tries to provide. Such inef-ficiencies have been criticized so clearly and for solong that it is evident they will only be overcomeby radical changes in the organization of healthcaresuch as a shift in the government's role fromproviding care to financing care and stimulatingcompetition among providers. These changes willin turn require a clear distinction between essentialand discretionary spending and a new determina-tion by governments to achieve value for money inhealth services. There is no other equitable way tocontrol government spending.Most governments also perform poorly in regu-lating markets for private services, including in-surance. As recent research in Brazil has shown,the quality of medical care could be substantiallyimproved at low cost if government dischargedthis role better. The rapid growth and almost totallack of regulation of private insurance in suchcountries as Brazil and Korea present another chal-lenge for which governments are ill-prepared. Allocation of spending to cost-effective servicesThere are no calculations of how many years ofhealthy life are currently saved by health systems.Nonetheless, it is clear that many of them performmuch worse than they might. Many governmentsspend too much on sophisticated hospital servicesof low cost-effectiveness and too little on essentialpublic health and clinical services. The share ofpublic expenditures for health absorbed by tertiaryand secondary care hospitals, for example, is ashigh as 70 to 75 percent in Jordan and Venezuela.Tertiary care hospitals alone may consume 30 to 50percent of the health budget. Only a quarter ofgovernment spending, and often less, is devoted 65Table 3.2 Actual and proposed allocation of public expenditure on health in developing countries, 1990(dollars per capita) Package componentPublic health Essential clinical services(minimum package) Total, public health and 1222155-7minimum essential clinicalservicesDiscretionary clinical services' TotalNote: Current spending on essential clinical services is estimated to be 20-30 percent of total public expenditure on health on the basis of estimatesin World Bank health sector reports. The numbers reported should be regarded as approximations.Estimated for an income level of $350 per capita.Estimated for an income level of $2,500 per capita.Estimated residually. The negative number for low-income countries reflects total spending below the cost of the package.Source: World Bank calculations; World Bank sector reports on Ghana (1989), India (1992), Indonesia (1991), Jamaica (1989), Jordan (1989), Mexico(1989), Nigeria (1991), Pakistan (1992), Turkey (1990), and Venezuela (1992). to cost-effective public health measures and essen-tial clinical care, delivered mainly in health centersand communities. In many countries the share ofpublic spending devoted to these basic serviceshas been falling in recent years. In Brazil 64 per-cent of public spending on health in 1965 was forpreventive and public health activities, but by themid-1980s the share had dropped to 15 percent,and hospitals absorbed fully 70 percent of expendi-ture. The resulting weakness of the primary carenetwork leads patients to seek care in hospitals; Upto 80 percent of the cases crowding hospital emer-gency rooms could be treated as effectively, butmore cheaply, at the primary level.In the world as a whole, almost half the existingdisease burden is from communicable diseases,nutritional disorders, and maternal and perinatalcauses. It is primarily these problems that an ap-66Spending under the proposed packageLow-Middle-Allincomeincomedevelopingcount riescount ri Contents package of care would ad-dress. Even the best-designed care package couldnot prevent all the health damage from these dis-eases because of the low cost-effectiveness of someinterventions and the increasing marginal costs ofeven the best ones. Still, because of the size of theburden and the low cost per DALY of the interven-tions, it is reasonable to conclude that public ex-penditure on health should initially be concen-trated on those conditions. What this implies forthe distribution of spending by type of input orlevel of facility is less clear, but it probably meansthat facilities above the district hospital levelshould account for only a small share of the total,primarily for dealing with referrals.Table 3.2 illustrates the degree of misallocationof health spending by comparing estimated actualexpenditure with what would be spent for a pack-613-15All other health services,including low-cost-effectiveness treatment ofcancer, cardiovascular disease,other chronic conditions,major trauma, andneurological and psychiatricdisorders2121age of health services designed to address mosteffectively the burden of disease in the developingworld. This package consists of public health ser-vices that would cost just over $4 per capita in poorcountries (with average income per capita of $350)and a minimum package of essential clinical ser-vices that would cost about $8 per capita more. Inmiddle-income countries (with average income percapita of $2,500), the same package of publichealth measures and essential clinical serviceswould cost about 80 percent more, or $22 per per-son. This difference partly reflects different epi-demiological conditions, but input costs, particu-larly salaries, would also be higher in middle-income countries. Many countries will define theessential clinical package much more broadly thanthe minimum discussed here. Even in relativelypoor countries, targeting public finance of essen-tial services to the poor would allow creation of abroader and more generous package. Such a pack-age can be built up by adding interventions in or-der of decreasing cost-effectiveness until the addi-tional health gain is judged not to be worth thecost, given the country's resources. To ensure po-litical support and to deal with problems of marketfailure and equity, countries may choose to financethe essential package universally from public, orpublicly mandated, sources.Governments in developing countries spend anestimated $21 per capita on health, for a total ofabout $84 billion. It is estimated that only a littlemore than $1 per person, or a total of $5 billion,goes for cost-effective public health measures. Tobuy the package described here, countries wouldneed almost to quintuple what they spend on pub-lic health. About $4 to $6 per capita, or $17 billionto $25 billion total, goes for clinical services deliv-ered through lower-level facilities or classified asprimary health care. These services commonly in-clude many of those in the essential clinical carepackage, but they are usually not delivered to theentire population. And this expenditure includessome less cost-effective services that should be re-garded as discretionary. Paying for a minimumpackage of essential clinical care would require ex-penditure of an additional $16 billion to $24 billion,doubling the current expenditure level. If totalspending did not change, this would imply a re-duction by about half in what is now spent ondiscretionary services.For some countries, paying for the proposedpackage of services poses a severe challenge. Infact, in the poorest countries total current publicspending of $6 per person is about $6 short of thecost of the package. Total per capita spending, in-cluding private spending, is about $14, about thesame as the proposed package. This means thateither substantial private resources will have to beused or additional government resources will beneeded; even if all public expenditure on discre-tionary services were eliminated, current govern-ment spending on health would not meet the costsof the package.Since the minimum package would cost onlyabout $60 billion for all developing countries to-gether, the task is to reallocate resources in mid-dle-income countries and to find additional re-sourcesofabout $10billioninlow-incomecountries. The $8 to $10 per capita needed in extraspending on public health measures and essentialclinical services is less than the $13 to $15 per cap-ita now spent, on average, on discretionary ornonessential clinical services. In fact, spending onthese less cost-effective services is now roughlydouble the amount that countries spend on therecommended package of public health measuresand essential clinical care. The right combinationof reallocation and additional expenditure wouldallow governments to achieve a large improve-ment in overall health.Table 3.3 indicates how large this gain could be.Properly allocated, an expenditure of only $12 perperson in low-income countries (excluding China)would be enough to reduce the disease burden byalmost one-third. This is 226 million DALYs,equivalent to 7.0 million infant deaths per year. Inmiddle-income countries the proposed packagecould deal with only 15 percent of the disease bur-den, despite the higher expenditure per person.The total reduction in ill health in middle-incomecountries would be about 45 million DALYs, theequivalent of 1.4 million infant deaths per year.The smaller gain in these countries reflects the factthat they have already eliminated much of the bur-den from easily controlled communicable diseases.A large part of the remaining burden is caused bychronic disease and disability.It is assumed that the disease burden would de-cline by the same share in China as in a middle-income country because China has already sub-stantially reduced the burden from the diseasesaddressed by the package. About 30 millionDALYs could be gained, the equivalent of 930,000infant deaths prevented. The cost per capita wouldbe the same as in low-income countries.Full coverage with the minimum package wouldcost an estimated $22 billion in low-income coun-tries, $14 billion in China, and $26 billion inmiddle-income countries. The total cost would beabout $62 billion, or $15 per person in the develop-67ing world as a whole. This figure includes whatcountries are already spending on the services inthe package, estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion.The incremental cost would therefore be only $30billion to $40 billion a year.The gain in health would be about 300 millionDALYs, which is equivalent to 9.3 million infantdeaths.Universal application of the packagewould therefore yield about the same health gainas eliminating nearly all the infant deaths in theworld today. These gains could be achieved for anaverage cost of about $50 per DALY for the publichealth measures and about $100 per DALY for theminimum package of essential clinical services.The cost per DALY of the interventions in thepackage ranges from less than $5 to more than$200; average costs also reflect those public healthmeasures that do not improve health directly butthat are essential to the functioning of a healthsystem.In both low-income and middle-income coun-tries the marginal cost per DALY would be lessthan the average cost because all the fixed costs ofinfrastructure are included in these estimates andthere would be spare capacity for producing smalladditional amounts of most services. Because ofjoint costs, it is difficult to separate the cost perDALY for every intervention in the package.In middle-income countries the package couldbe entirely financed by reallocating current publicspending. In poor countries there would be ashortfall of about $10 billion a year, which could be 68Table 3.3 Total cost and potential health gains of a package of public health and essential clinical services, 1990 Estimated from data for Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Sub-Saharan Africa. China is shown separately because its cost per capita is assumed to be that of a low-income country but its percentage reduction in disease burden is assumed to be that of a middle-income country.Estimated from data for Latin America and the Caribbean, Other Asia and islands except for Indonesia and Bangladesh, and the Middle Eastern crescent except for Egypt and Pakistan.Source: World Bank calculations. covered by a combination of greater public spend-ing, increased donor contributions, and more pri- vate expenditure by those able to pay. Shiftingsome part of the cost to higher-income con-sumersfor example, through private or social in-surancewould allow for an expansion of thepackageorareducedburdenofpublic expenditure.There are several reasons why developing coun- tries fail to allocate sufficient resources to cost-effective health interventions. Health providersoften lack incentives to provide cost-effective ser- vices. Doctors' pay, promotion, and professionalrecognition are enhanced by specialization and bythe use of expensive new medical technologynotby serving as public health doctors or district medical officers in poor rural areas. Badly de-signed government salary schedules and price sys-tems may exacerbate this trend. In China hospitalscurrently have a strong incentive to use new diag-nostic and therapeutic technologies, for which fullcosts can be charged, instead of older and less ex- pensive technologies for which government-setprices are far below actual costs.Consumer demand for cost-effective services isoften weak. This may reflect lack of information.In rural Africa, for example, goiter and impairedmental abilities from iodine deficiency have inmany places become accepted as the normal stateof affairs. Low demand may also reflect deficien-cies in supply.

The urbanpopulation is better organized than rural groupsand more vocal in demanding health facilities andservices. Similarly, middle-class workers in wageemployment, who frequently belong to powerfultrade unions, are more effective than self-em-ployed farmers and workers in the informal sectorin lobbying for government-subsidized healthbenefits. Health professionals are also often betterorganized than the population they serve, and inpromoting their own interests they may make thehealth system less efficient. Despite these prob-lems, many countries have succeeded in dramati-cally improving the health of their people. Thissuccess can be accelerated, as newly available in-formation makes it clear how costly misallocationis and how much health can be gained for rela-tively modest levels of spending.Equity in health status, utilization, and financeData on health status, physical access to healthservices, consumption of health care, the distribu-tion of the financial burden of health care spend-ing, and public expenditures for health all tell thesame story of severe inequities in developingcountries. In Bangladesh, for example, the infantmortality rate for the urban poor (13.4 percent) isnearly twice the urban average (6.8 percent) andabout 50 percent higher than the average rate forthe entire country (10 percent). In China, despiteremarkable overall progress in health (infant mor-tality fell from 20 percent in 1950 to 4.6 percent in1982), there is considerable geographic variation,which is strongly related to income. Poor regionssuch as Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Tibet have infantmortality rates of more than 7 percent, comparedwith less than 2 percent in more affluent Beijing,Guangdong, Shanghai, and Tianjin. To take an-other example, in Kenya the probability of achild's dying before age 2 varied among ethnicgroups from 7.4 to 19.7 percent, and in Cameroontheseprobabilities ranged from 11.6 to20.5percent.The poor also have considerably worse access tohealth care. A number of surveys show that low-income households, especially in rural areas, haveto travel considerably farther or longer to reach thefirst level of referral services, usually a primaryhealth care center or doctor's office. In Indonesiain 1991, for example, rural households in the topincome decile were three times more likely to livein a village with a health center than those in thebottom decile.Partly because of difficulties in access, the poorin developing countries generally consume fewerhealth services. Household surveys from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America demonstrateclearly that among people who report themselvesto be sick, those in urban areas seek and obtainmedical care more often than those in rural areas,and the wealthy contact a care provider more oftenthan do the poor. The differences can be large: inC\u00f4te d'Ivoire in the mid-1980s, for example, anurban household was nearly twice as likely to seekcare as a rural household (60 versus 36 percent),and within the rural population a family in the topincome quintile was almost twice as likely to seekcare as a family in the bottom quintile (44 versus 23percent).A study of Peru showed similar inequalitiesamonggeographicregionsandeducationalgroups. There was little variation in self-declaredillness, but the likelihood of obtaining medical carewhen sick was nearly three times higher in someparts of the country than in others. Regional dif-ferences in immunization rates were highest foruneducated mothers, whose children were onlyone-third as likely to be fully immunized as thechildren of women with secondary schooling. The36 percent of all the self-declared sick who lived inthe capital city accounted for 53 percent of all Min-istry of Health ambulatory consultations, 41 per-cent of hospital admissions, and 47 percent of allpublic expenditure attributable to care for individ-ual patients. At the other extreme was Piura, apoor mountainous region with 10 percent of thesick but only 4 percent of public spending and ofconsultations.Inequity in public spending for health both ac-counts for and reflects marked inequalities in ac-cess to and utilization of care. In Indonesia, forexample, despite significant investments in lower-level health facilities in the 1980s, only 12 percentof public spending for health in 1990 went for ser-vices consumed by the bottom 20 percent ofhouseholds, while the top 20 percent obtained 29percent of the government subsidy. This bias infavor of the wealthy was mainly a result of thedistribution of government spending for hospitalinpatient and ambulatory care, services that wereused more frequently by the rich. Much more un-equal situations can be found in many countries 69that concentrate government spending even moreon high-level facilities.The few countries in which public spending onhealth is biased toward the poor show that govern-ment policies can help reduce inequities in accessand health status. In Malaysia the government hasfollowed a pro-poor policy since the 1970s, withthe lowest-income groups receiving a larger shareof public subsidies for health than the middle classand the wealthy. Similarly, in Costa Rica govern-ment spending for health has continued to favorthe poor, despite economic shocks and a majoradjustment program in the 1980s that entailed cutsin public expenditure. In 1988 about 30 percent ofgovernment spending for health went to the poor-est 20 percent of households and just over 10 per- cent of spending to the richest 20 percent. Thepoverty-oriented pattern of public spending forhealth in Costa Rica can be explained largely bythe high degree of coverage by the social securityhealth system (the entire population is covered inprinciple, even though only 63 percent of theworking population contributes) and the relativelyequal access to and quality of care enjoyed by allCosta Ricans. It also helps that the wealthy get most of their outpatient care from the privatesector.Consumer satisfaction with health careHow satisfied people are with their own healthand their health care can be only partly explainedby objective criteria; subjective expectations mat- ter. People can also be pleased with their own health care and dissatisfied with their country's health system as a whole. A comparison of ten OECD countries with different health systems found that in eight countries public satisfactionwas related to the level of spending. Canada, withthe second-highest expenditure, had the highestsatisfaction rating, and people were generally bet-ter satisfied with the costlier health systems ofFrance, Germany, and the Netherlands than withthe lower-spending systems in Australia, Italy, Ja- pan, and the United Kingdom. Both very high ex- penditure and great dissatisfaction were found inthe United States. The study also showed thathaving a unified national health system did not guarantee a high level of satisfaction. In mostcountries 30 to 50 percent of those polled sup- ported \"fundamental changes\" in the health sys- tem. In Italy and the United States many peoplethought that such changes would not suffice and that the health system should be \"completelyrebuilt.\" 70Household surveys systematically show thatpeople choose whether to seek care and whichprovider to consult on the basis of many factorshours of service, travel time or cost, waiting time,availability of doctors or of drugs, and how pa-tients are personally treated. The time required to get care can be valued according to local wages and treated as a cost of service together withmoney payments. On this basis, free public medi-cal care often is more costly than unsubsidized pri-vate care for which patients do not have to travelso far or wait so long. It is not surprising that,under these circumstances, even poor people ex-press their dissatisfaction with public services bypaying for a great deal of private outpatient care.In both El Salvador and the Dominican Republicresidents of the poorest quintile of the capital cityobtain more than half their ambulatory care fromprivate physicians. Although the price of privatecare to the poorest quintile is, on average, half thatfor patients in the richest quintile, it is still fifteentimes higher than Ministry of Health fees. Differ-ences in waiting timeone hour for private pa-tients as against two and a half hours at Ministryof Health facilitiesaccount for much of this effect.Sensitivity to price and travel time is also foundin rural Peru and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. But private hospi-tal care is still much too expensive for the poor;even those who use private doctors go to publichospitals. The excessive use of hospital care in re- lation to ambulatory services often seen in publichealth systems partly reflects dissatisfaction withthe high cost in time and the perceived poor qual-ity of ambulatory care. In the absence of incentivesto improve lower-level facilities and service, thisoveruse reinforces the tendency to concentrate re-sources on hospitals, urban areas, and less cost-effective interventions.The importance of public satisfaction with ahealth care system raises two issues for the pack-age of publicly financed services proposed here.First, it suggests that quality can be maintainedonly if coverage is broad enough. Services de-signed only for the poor will almost inevitably below in quality and will not receive the political sup- port necessary for adequate provision. This is a difficult political issue because it may be hard to maintain equity and control costs if coverage isuniversal. The proper balance between more care for fewer people and thesame amount of care formore people depends on ensuring that the poorhave access to the same quality of care as everyoneelse and on limiting public finance to cost-effectiveservices for which there is a sound rationale. Sec-ond, reform of public provision alone, importantas it may be, may have much less effect on healthoutcomes, costs, and satisfaction than reforms thatalso try to stimulate competition and improve peo-ple's access to a variety of providers.Matching means and endsThe objectives of a health system are to improveoutcomes, control costs, increase equity, and sat-isfy users. Policy instruments, however, do notcorrespond to individual objectives. What govern-ments actually do is build facilities, buy equipmentand supplies, hire and train people, set fees orother service conditions, regulate providers andinsurers,disseminateinformation,determineoverall policy, and maintain surveillance of diseaseconditions or other variables. Misallocation and in-equity are caused by mistakes in deciding whatfacilities to build, where to locate them, how tostaff them, and what services to provide. If gov-ernments spend too much on tertiary care, for ex-ample, not only can they not adequately financemore cost-effective care, but they also cannotprovide equitably what care they do offer be-cause facilities will inevitably be geographicallyconcentrated.One of the principal responsibilities of govern-ment is to match the available instruments of poi-icythe levers the public sector actually controlsto the objectives. Much of governments' failure toachieve better health outcomes derives not fromthe wrong choice of objectives but from the wrongchoice of instrumentsin particular, from toomuch reliance on direct provision of care and cen-tral control of health facilities and too little use ofthe financial, informational, and regulatory instru-ments at the disposal of the government. Theseinstruments are particularly important for improv-ing performance in the private market. When gov-ernments pay for health care in addition to regulat-ing it, they have a further responsibility to providevalue for money by ensuring that public resourcesgo first to cost-effective public health and essentialclinical services so as to buy the largest health gainpossible. 71Public health Health services interact with households in twofundamentally different ways. Public health pro- grams strike against health problems of entirepopulations or population subgroups. Their objec- tive is to prevent disease or injury and to provideinformation on self-cure andon the importance ofseeking care. Clinical services respond to demand from individuals. They generally seek to cure or to ease the pain of those already sick. This chapterdiscusses public health; Chapter 5 turns to clinical services.Public health programs work in three ways: theydeliver specific health services to populations (for ex- ample, immunizations), they promote healthy be- havior, and they promote healthy environments.Governments play a leading role, and provision ofinformation through public education is a central feature of most programs, especially those de- signed to change behavior. But difficult choices have to be made about the best use of publicmoney. The Expanded Programme on Immuniza-tion (EPI), described below, is highly cost-effec-tive, at about $25 per DALY gained, but not all programs offer such good value for money. Thischapter examines sixparticularly cost-effectivepublic health services in the realms of population- based services (including immunization), nutri- tion, fertility, tobacco and other drugs, the house- hold and external environment (including control of insect vectors of disease), and AIDS. Public health packages in developing countries should in- clude components in mostor all of these six areas.Population-based health servicesIn 1979 the World Health Organization declared that smallpox had been eradicated. It then initi- 72ated, in collaboration with UNICEF, a global effort to prevent a range of childhood diseases by immu-nization. The EPI now reaches about 80 percent of children in developing countries and averts an es- timated 3.2 million deathsa year at a cost of $1.4billion a year.Population-based health services such as the EPIrely on personnel with limited training to providedrugs, vaccines, or specific health services directlyto specific populationsin schools, at worksites,or in households. Government finance for suchprograms is justified because the objective is usu- ally to provide services to all in a community, be-cause the services create externalities or indirectbenefits, and because the diseases they typically combat are particular problems for the poor. Three types of interventions are immunization, mass treatment for worms and other infections, andscreening and referral. Information, education,and communication are critical to many such pro-grams, both to attract participation and to achievedurable change in behavior. ImmunizationVaccines to prevent tuberculosis, measles, diph-theria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio have revolu-tionized preventive medicineover the past twodecades. Costs are less than $10 per DALY gainedfor measles immunization and less than $25 for a combination of polio plus DPT (diphtheria, per-tussis, and tetanus). These vaccines, together withBCG immunization against tuberculosis and lep-rosy and immunization of pregnant women against tetanus, form the EPI.As a result of the EPI, the proportion of childrenimmunized rose from less than 5 percent in 1977 to20 to 30 percent by 1983. By 1990 coverage withpolio, DPT, and measles vaccines had reached ap-proximately 80 percent of all children, and about35 percent of pregnant women were receiving tet-anus toxoid. The lowest vaccine coverage is re-ported in Sub-Saharan Africa.Had vaccination coverage remained at the lowlevels of the 1970s, as many as 120 million DALYs ayear (the equivalent of 23 percent of the globalburden of disease among children under age 5 in1990) would be lost to diseases preventable by theEPI. At current levels of vaccination coverage,these diseases cause a loss of 55 million DALYs, or10 percent of the disease burden among childrenunder age 5 (Table 4.1).The cost of fully immunizing a child in low-income countries is about $15, with a range of $6 tomore than $20, depending on the prices of laborand other local inputs. Reducing the number ofcontacts needed to immunize each child fullycould cut costs dramatically, by as much as 70 per-cent if only one contact instead of the current fivewere needed. This prospect depends on the suc-cess of ongoing research efforts. Technical im-provements in the cold chain (by which vaccinesare kept refrigerated until use), good administra-tion, widespread deployment of delivery teams,and effective social mobilization efforts can alsocontribute to dramatic cost reductions. In theGambia the cost of immunizations fell from $19 in1982 to $6 in 1988. Costs also depend on the immu-nization strategy: campaigns achieve high initialcoverage, but routine services are more cost-effec-tive. In Ecuador campaigns cost $66 per DALYgained compared with $30 for routine services. Be-cause many countries lack the infrastructure to de-liver vaccines routinely in remote rural areas, cam- Table 4.1 Burden of childhood diseases preventable by the Expanded Programme on Immunization(EPI) by demographic region, 1990paigns continue to be justified. In areas with betterinfrastructure, routine services make more sense.An ambitious current goal, established in 1988by WHO's governing body, the World Health As-sembly, is to eradicate polio by 2000. Currenttrends suggest that even if eradication is notachieved on that schedule, it will be soon there-after. And substantial success has already beenachieved: there has been no naturally occurringcase of polio in the Western Hemisphere since Au-gust 1991.Two extensions to the EPI appear to be justified.First, coverage should be extended, probably to 95percent of all children born. The costs of expand-ing coverage are relatively high, but so are thegains. Those not covered at present often lack anyhealth services and are disproportionately vulner-able to the diseases. Second, it makes sense toinclude additional items in the package: hepatitis Band yellow fever vaccines for selected countriesand vitamin A and iodine supplements in regionswhere deficiency of these micronutrients is highlyprevalent.If micronutrients are not deliveredthrough the EPI, some other vehicle must befound for reaching very young children. Addingthese two vaccines and two micronutrients to theEPI (EPI Plus) would improve health substantially,particularly in the poorest households, for a mod-est increase of about 15 percent in the cost ofreaching each child with complete services (vac-cine and micronutrients). Table 4.2 summarizesthe estimated costs and health benefits of the EPIPlus cluster in two different settings. Total annualcosts range between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion forEPI Plus, or less than 2 percent of the public healthexpenditure of developing countries. Expandingcoverage from 80 to 95 percent would probably * Less than 1.Note: The EPI includes immunizations for pertussis, polio, diphtheria, measles, tetanus, and tuberculosis. These estimates exclude the burdenfrom tuberculosis because most of it falls on adults.Source: Calculated from Murray and Lopez, background paper. 73RegionBurden (millionsof DALYS per year)Share of thetotal burden 5 (percent)Burden per 1,000children under age 5(DALYs)Sub-Saharan Africa 23 15 242India 16 12 137China I 3 8Other Asia and islands 7 10 81Latin America and the Caribbean .1 3 18Middle Eastern crescent 7 10 86Formerly socialist economies of Europe * IEstablished market economies * IWorld 55 10 87Table 4.2 Costs and health benefits of the EPI Plus cluster in two developing country settings, 1990 74increase annual costs by between $500 million and$750 million.

Mass treatment for parasitic worm infectionThe most common intestinal wormsround-worms, hookworms, and whipwormseach infectbetween 170 million and 400 million school-agechildren annually. Schistosomiasis infection, alsocaused by parasitic worms, affects almost 100 mil-lion school-age children annually. The immediateeffects of infectionincluding failure to thrive,anemia, and impaired cognitioncan now be rap-idly reversed by low-cost, single-dose oral ther-apy. inKenya, with worm-induced disease in India, andwith trichuriasis in the West Indies showed re-markable spurts in growth and development in allthe populations studied, including the large per-centages of children with asymptomatic infections.And treatment also appears to have improved cog-nitive development.Curing worm infections is simple with inexpen-sive modern drugs such as albendazole and prazi-quantel because it is not necessary to determinewhich species are present. Furthermore, the highlevel of safety of these drugs has led WHO to de-velop protocols for their use on a mass basis(where a high prevalence of infection exists) andby providers who are not medically trainedacombination that makes for high cost-effective-ness. Treatment usually cures the current infec-tion, but in endemic areas children will inevitablybecome reinfected. A return to pretreatment levelsof infection typically takes about twelve monthsfor roundworm and whipworm and twenty-fourmonths or more for hookworm. Rates of reinfec-Note: Figures are based on 95 percent coverage.a. Income per capita in 1990 was assumed to be $350 for low-income countries and $2,500 for middle-income Countries.Source: World Bank data and authors' calculations. tion can be reduced by environmental improve-ments, especially sanitation, but where this is im-practical or unaffordable, itis cost-effective torepeat the therapy at regular intervals.The benefits of individual treatment can be sig-nificantly enhanced by community-wide treatmentwhich, by lowering the overall levels of contam-ination of the environment with infective stages ofthe worms, slows the rate of reinfection. Treat-ment programs targeted at the most heavily infec-ted group (school-age children) reduce infectionimmediately both among those treated and in therest of the population. Treatment through schoolsalso allows delivery at relatively low cost: a pro-gram in Montserrat was estimated to cost less than$1.50 per person for a cycle of eight treatments. Aprogram managed by a nongovernmental organi-zation in Jakarta initially cost $0.74 per capita peryear, but after expansion to almost 1,000 schoolsthe costs fell to $0.26. Such programs are ex-tremely cost-effective, at $15 to $30 per DALYgained. In light of this cost-effectiveness and theburden of disease addressed, the RockefellerFoundation and the UNDP are initiating a majorprogram to document and explore the potential ofschool-based health interventions that focus ondewormingandprovisionofmicronutrientsupplements. Mass screening and referralMass screening for disease control involves the ex-amination of asymptomatic individuals to identifyand treat those affected by disease. Although thismethod has been used to control some infectiousdiseases, such as tuberculosis, it is mostly usedfor noncommunicable diseases. Mass screeningmakes sense for highly prevalent diseases that canbe cured by early treatment, especially when la-tency periods span many years. An example is cer-Costs and benefits Low-income countries(high mortality and fertility)Middle-income countries(low mortality andmedium fertility)Cost per capita (dollars) 0.5 0.8 Cost per fully immunized child (dollars) 14.6 28.6 Cost per DALY gained (dollars) 12-17 25-30 Cost per DALY gained as a percentage ofincome per capita 0.14 0.03 Potential health gains as a percentageof the global burden of disease 6.0 1.0vical cancer, which is the leading cause of deathfrom cancer among women in developing coun-tries, accounting for 150,000 deaths each year.Screening with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears is com-mon in industrial countries, but attempts to repli-cate those efforts in developing countries haverarely been successful. Such programs could,however, be made cost-effective by the use of asimplified design that targets women over 35,screens only every five to ten years, and uses inex-pensive outpatient treatment (such as freezing ab-normal cells) for severe precancerous conditions.When backed up with good follow-up services,such interventions at $150 to$200 per DALY gained.Diet and nutritionEating well is necessary for good health. Eitherdirectly or in association with infectious diseases,inadequate diets account for a large share of theworld's disease burden, including as much as aquarter of that among children. Much of this suf-fering stems from poverty-related underconsump-tion of protein and energy, but equally importantare deficiencies of key micronutrientsiodine,vitamin A, and ironfrom which children andwomen suffer disproportionately. Increasing theincomes of the poor is the most effective means ofreducing protein-energy malnutrition, but govern-ments can play an effective direct role through nu-trition education, measures to increase consump-tion of micronutrients, and reduction in diarrhealand parasitic infections among children. Public ac-tion is also essential for preventing crop failuresfrom leading to famines.Malnutrition and ill healthLow height for a given age, or stunting, is the mostprevalent symptom of protein-energy malnutri-tion; approximately 40 percent of all two-year-oldsin developing countries are short for their age (seeAppendix table A.6). The prevalence of stuntingmay be as high as 65 percent in India; it is morethan 50 percent in Asia other than India and Chinaand about 40 percent in China and Sub-SahranAfrica. Stunted children are often also under-weight or have low weight for their age. Wasting(low weight for a given height) is less prevalent-11 percent or less worldwide except in India,where it reaches 27 percent.Diets must contain both energy and protein. Be-cause little is known about the relative importanceof adding energy or protein to an initially poordiet, the effect of deficiencies in either or bothcomponents is combined under the term \"protein-energy malnutrition.\" Foods rich in protein, suchas soybeans and animal products, tend to be rela-tively costly per unit of energy, and low-costsources of energy such as cassava tend to be ex-pensive per unit of protein. Because food takes upmuch of a poor household's budget, choosing theprotein-energy balance that is right for health canbe difficult.Protein-energy malnutrition raises the risk ofdeath and may reduce physical and mental capac-ity. Worldwide, about 780 million people are esti-mated to be energy deficient according to WHOstandards. It is not known how many of them arealso protein deficient, or how many people whoget enough energy may still suffer from shortageof protein. Exploratory studies of the determinantsof human growth suggest that at the margin, theimportance of additional protein may be greaterthanisrecognized. Malnutrition isnot syn-onymous with hunger because people who havebecome accustomed to a deficient diet may notconsider themselves hungry. If malnutrition iswidespread in the community, underweight andlethargic children look normal to parents who donot know how healthy children behave.Iron deficiency is the most common micro-nutrient disorder. It reduces physical productivityand children's capacity to learn in school. By re-ducing appetite, it may diminish children's intakeand growth. Women suffer especially becausemenstruation and childbearing raise their need foriron, and anemia, a shortage of iron in the blood,increases the risk of death from hemorrhage inchildbirth. The problem is worst in India, where 88percent of pregnant women are anemic. Almost 60percent of women are anemic in other parts ofAsia, but the proportion does not exceed 40 per-cent in China, Africa, or Latin America. Anemiaaffects 15 percent of pregnant women in the estab-lished market economies.Iodine deficiency causes mental retardation, de-layed motor development, and stunting, as well asneuromuscular, speech, and hearing disorders. Itis the leading preventable cause of intellectual im-pairment in the world. Cretinism from iodine defi-ciency affects about 5.7 million people, and lack ofiodine causes another 20 million to be mentallyretarded.Vitamin A deficiency causes varying degrees ofvision loss and is the primary cause of acquiredblindness in children. It also increases the severity 75Table 4.3 Direct and indirect contributions of malnutrition to the global burden of disease, 1990(millions of DALYs, except as specified) 76Based on the global burden of disease (GBD) attributable to deaths from tuberculosis, measles, pertussis, malaria, and diarrheal and respira-tory diseases in children under age 5; in developing countries 25 percent of those deaths are attributed to mild or moderate underweight.Based on estimated deaths attributable to vitamin A deficiency in the age groups 6-Il months and 1-4 years. These account for, respectively, 10 and 30 percent of all such deaths in high-risk countries and for 3 and 10 percent of all such deaths in other countries. Thirty lost DALY5 are attributed to each child death; losses are redistributed to the regional classification used in this Report.Source: For GBD calculations, Appendix B; for estimate of mortality from underweight, Pelletier 1991; for estimate of mortality from vitamin A deficiency, Humphrey, West, and Sommer 1992. Women suffer more than men from iron deficiencyanemia, from stunting caused by protein-energy mal-nutrition, and from iodine deficiency. The largest gapis for iron deficiency anemia, which affects 458 millionadult women but 238 million men. About 450 millionwomen are stunted because of protein-energy malnu-trition, compared with 400 million men. Iodine defi-ciency also affects substantial numbers of women,probably more than for men. Corneal lesions andblindness caused by vitamin A deficiency afflict bothsexes equally, but deficiency as such is twice as com-mon for girls as for boys. Women's nutritional prob-lems are worst in South Asia, where prevalences ofanemia, protein-energy malnutrition, and vitamin Adeficiency are the highest in the world and where, as aresult of widespread discrimination, girls and womensuffer disproportionately.Small pelvic size among stunted women increasesthe risk of maternal and infant mortality, as does ma-ternal anemia. Iodine-deficient mothers give birth tomore infants with cretinism and other congenital ab-normalities. A significant proportion of pregnanciesend in poor maternal or infant health as a direct conse-quence of maternal malnutrition.Iodine and vitamin A deficiencies tend to be lo-calized rather than widely distributed and could be vir-tually eliminated through targeted, sporadic interven-tions, given a reasonable health infrastructure and ahigh level of political will. Anemia and protein-energymalnutrition, by contrast, affect much larger numbersof women and require more continuous intervention.Distribution of a regular supply of ferrous sulfate tab-lets can prevent or cure anemia among pregnant andlactating women. Such efforts should include allwomen of reproductive age, certainly where the preva-lence of anemia among women in general exceeds 50percent. To reduce protein-energy malnutrition, muchmust be done outside the health sector toward makingmore food available to households, increasing employ-ment opportunities for women, decreasing the timeand energy costs of women's home production, andreducing discrimination against otherdiseases attributedto vitamin Adeficiencyb13.414.01.07.01.82.00.00.039.1 Box 4.1 Women's nutrition1of and mortality from a variety of infections, espe-cially measles and diarrhea. WHO calculates that13.8 million children have some degree of eyedamage because of vitamin A deficiency; of these,250,000 to 500,000 go blind every year, and two-thirds of the blinded children die. Both vitamin Aand iodine deficiency are particularly common inAsia and Sub-Saharan Africa.These four diseases of malnutrition caused a di-rect loss of almost 46 million DALYs in 1990, or 3.4percent of the global burden of disease (Table 4.3).(The estimates do not include the health damagefrom deficiencies of other micronutrients. Calciumdeficiency may be the most important of these; itcauses bone deformities and slows skeletal growthin children, and it may contribute to osteoporosisin the elderly.) The estimated burden is slightlylarger for females than males because anemia af-fects mostly women ages 15-44 (Box 4.1); anemiaaccounts for 1.3 percent of the total female diseaseburden but for 24 percent among women in thereproductive ages. Children under 5 are the princi-pal victims of vitamin A deficiency, iodine defi-ciency, and protein-energy malnutrition. The nu-tritional disease burden for young children is 32million DALYs, or 6 percent of their total burden ofillness.The total impact of malnutrition on health ismuch larger, however, because mild or moderateprotein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient de-ficiencies (as well as overcorisumption of energy,fat, salt, and sugar) are risk factors for illness anddeath. Studies in Asia and Africa consistentlyshow that mild to moderate stunting or under-weight in children raises the risk of death (Figure4.1), contributing to 25 to 50 percent of childhoodmortality. The greatest risk occurs for children intheir second year, after they are weaned. Malnour-ished children die principally from measles, diar-rheal and respiratory disease, tuberculosis, per-tussis, and malaria. Child deaths from thesediseases cost 231 million DALYs, making the totalburden attributable to malnutrition at least one-fourth that amount, or 60 million DALYs.Vitamin A deficiency, too, raises the risk ofdeath from other causes. Of the 8 million deaths ofchildren with vitamin A deficiency that occur echyear, between 1.3 million and 2.5 million might beprevented by eliminating the vitamin deficiency,for a gain of 39 million to 74 million DALYs. Dam-age from being underweight and from vitamin Adeficiency cannot be added together because manychildren suffer from both problems. Nonetheless,Childhood mortality drops sharply as ,iutritionalstatus improves. Figure 4.1 Child mortality (in specific ageranges) and weight-for-age in Bangladesh,India, Papua New Guinea, and Tanzania 2.54, Note: NCHS, (U.S.) National Center for Health Statistics.The vertical axis shows the child mortality rate, CMR, inlog-odds ratio form, log[CMR/(1000 - CMR)l. Thus, for achild in Punjab weighing 60 percent of the referencemedian, the probability of dying between 12 and 36months is 18 per 1,000.Source: Pelletier 1991. the total direct and indirect damage from malnutri-tion is at least 20 to 25 percent of the disease bur-den in children.Links between nutrition and growth in child-hood persist into adulthood. Both height and 7755657585Weight-for-age(percentage of NCHS reference median)- Tanzania, 18 6.7,J o0weight affect the risk of adult mortality. For menand women at all ages, greater height is associatedwith greater survival. Stunted adults are at par- ticularly high risk of cardiovascular disease andobstructive lung disease. If the relative risk ofdeath associated with stunting is the same in low-income countries as for richer populations, ap-proximately 300,000 adult female deaths betweenthe ages of 15 and 59 can be attributed to stunting.Sources of malnutritionBoth food consumption and communicable dis-ease affect nutritional status by way of a \"malnu-trition-infection complex.\" Food consumption de-pends both on people's capacity to acquire foodand on their knowledge of how to choose a nutri-tious diet. For infants the chief determinant of nu-tritional status is whether they are exclusivelybreastfed for at least the first four to six months oflife. In southern Brazil infants who were notbreastfed were eighteen times as likely to die fromdiarrhea and three times as likely to die from respi-ratory illness as breastfed babies, both becausethey got less to eat and because of increased risk ofinfection. After six months children need solidfood even if they are still breastfed. The composi-tion and hygiene of this food are crucial to contin-ued good health. INCOME AND FOOD SECURITY. Chronic malnutri-tion is mostly a consequence of poverty. Higherincome allows people to buy a more balanced diet,as well as better hygiene and medical care. In In-donesia during 1984-87 rising incomes translatedinto reduced malnutrition in nearly all fifty-tworegions of the country. The fraction of families eat-ing less than 2,200 calories per person per dayanenergy intake adequate for only light physical ac-tivitydeclined only 2 percentage points, but thedecline was 9 percentage points at 1,800 caloriesand 26 percentage points at 1,400 calories. Con-versely, increases in food prices in C\u00f4te d'Ivoireduring the 1980s reduced the weight of both chil-dren and adults. Nutrition is also affected by whoin the household controls the money; women'sincome is more likely than men's to be spent onbetter nutrition.Chronic food insecurity for poor people is oftenmade worse by seasonal fluctuations in availabilityand prices. In India and the Philippines temporalvariation in children's food intake is greatestamong poor households, and severely malnour-ished children are more likely to die during that 78part of the year when malnutrition is most preva-lent. Small variations in diet can be fatal to chil-dren already at risk.The extreme form of this risk is widespread fam-ine as a result of a breakdown in food production,food distribution, or the flow of income withwhich people buy food. Famines occurred inChina in 1959-61, in Bangladesh in 1974, in Ethio-pia and the Sahel in 1973-74, in Ethiopia andSomalia in the 1980s, and in Somalia and Sudan inthe early 1990s. As many as 30 million people arebelieved to have died in the Chinese famine andhundreds of thousands in the recent famines inSub-Saharan Africa. A relatively small number ofpeople die from outright starvation; many die ofinfectious diseases, to which people weakened byhunger are especially susceptible.Public action is critical in preventing a food crisisfrom becoming a famine. A combination of actionsis required to ensure that food is available in fam-ine areas (through both market and nonmarketmechanisms) and to sustain the incomes of vulner-able households (through public employment orother transfers). This is particularly difficult whenthere is a breakdown in order: the major Africanfamines of the past decade were mostly associatedwith war.Hunger and crowding into refugee camps facili-tate the spread of infectious disease and raise therisk of death from it,particularly when suchcamps are first established. Control of communica-ble disease is as crucial as the provision of food orof money to buy food. Even when refugee popula-tions are protected from starvation, they are oftenexposed to micronutrient deficiencies because theyare dependent on just a few foodstuffs. In recentyears there have been outbreaks of scurvy (vitaminC deficiency) in Ethiopia and Somalia, pellagra(niacin deficiency) among Mozambican refugees inMalawi, and ben-ben (thiamine deficiency) amongCambodian refugees in Thailand. In nonfamineconditions these diseases make no contribution tothe world's burden of disease.Beyond ensuring food distribution and control-ling the diseases that can easily become epidemicsin conditions of social and sanitary breakdown,governments have two overriding responsibilitiesin famines. The first is to recognize the early signsof trouble and act before large numbers of peoplehave become destitute. The second is to allow freeflow of information about conditions during thefamine so that relief agencies and others can react.Hiding the extent of a disaster only makes itworse.DIET AND DISEASE. Some children receive so lit-tle to eat that getting more food is by far the mostimportant means of improving their growth. Butfor those with a barely adequate diet, controllinginfectious disease can be as important as gettingmore food. (This is the most common situation inpoor countries.) In the absence of diarrhea, studieshave found little difference in growth in childrenup to thirty-six months of age despite significantdifferences in energy intake. Children with bothlow energy intake and diarrhea grow less. Diar-rhea has little effect on the growth of adequatelyfed children. However, a diet adequate for healthychildren may be inadequate under the additionaldemand imposed by infection.Control of parasitic worms can also help im-prove nutrition for older children. Hookworm andother intestinal worm infections cause anemia,and roundwormsthe most prevalent of allwormscompete with the host for food. All theseinfections may suppress appetite and reduce foodintake. More than 1 billion people are infectedwith one or more of these parasites, and about 100million of them suffer from stunting or wasting.Recent intervention studies show rapid spurts inheight after children are treated for worm infec-tions, suggesting that these infections may be sig-nificant contributors to malnutrition and that itmay be easier to reverse stunting in older childrenthan was previously believed.Malaria is the other major infection leading tomalnutrition, particularly anemia. It is an impor-tant risk factor in much of Africa. Control of ma-laria has led to substantial decreases in the preva-lence of anemia. LACK OF NUTRITIONAL KNOWLEDGE. People mayeat more poorly than their incomes allow becauseof ignorance. This is most true for vitamin A; defi-ciencies persist although almost everywhere in theworld foods rich in vitamin A can be grown at lowcost in family gardens or commercially The effectof ignorance cannot be quantified, but it is strikingthat it often increases the gender or age bias ofmalnutrition. In a number of Asian and Africancountries, children and women, especially preg-nant women, are discouraged from eating eggsand fruit. Ignorance also interacts with economicfactors. When the price of leafy vegetables rich invitamin A rises in the Philippines, people switch tovegetables containing much less of the vitamin. THENUTRITIONTRANSITIONANDCHRONICDISEASE. Better nutritional status reduces commu-nicable diseases but can also increase diseases ofdietary excess. As diets change, usually to includea smaller proportion of complex carbohydratesand more sugar and animal fat, people becomemore susceptible to cardiovascular disease and tocancers of the colon, prostate, and breast. Obesitybecomes more prevalent and increases the risk ofpremature death, particularly from cardiovasculardiseases and diabetes. Increased sugar consump-tion contributes to dental caries and may raise therisk of diabetes. High salt intake increases hyper-tension, raising the risks of stroke and cardio-vascular disease. For people eating a modern\"Western\" diet, a 60 percent reduction in lifetimesalt intake would reduce the risk of death fromcoronary disease at age 55 by 16 percent and therisk of death from stroke by 23 percent. The shareof the disease burden attributable to these dietarychanges is unknown but may be quite large.The diseases of overnutrition, which strike peo-ple later in life, may seem unimportant comparedwith those of undernutrition. The burden of car-diovascular disease and of some cancers, however,is already important in Brazil, China, and otherdeveloping countries; the demographic and epi-demiological transitions documented in Chapter 1will accelerate this trend. Treatment of chronic dis-ease is often expensive or ineffective, so modifyingdiet and other risks is the best way of avoidinggrowth in the burden from these diseases and inunnecessary health care expenditure.Other interventions for better nutritionSix other interventions, in addition to control ofinfectious diseases, may help to reduce malnutri-tion:nutrition education, control of intestinalparasites, micronutrient fortification of food, mi-cronutrient supplementation, food supplementa-tion, and food price subsidies. Control of parasiteswas discussed above; the other five interventionsare reviewed here. NUTRITIONEDUCATION. Inducingbehavioralchangethus enabling families to improve theirdiets even without additional incomeis often themost cost-effective way to improve nutritional sta-tus. In Indonesia a large-scale program to teachmothers about child feeding has reduced malnutri-tion among children at very low cost. In a Colom-bian program using food supplements and \"ma-ternal tutoring,\"theeffects of education onchildren's height and weight were as large as theeffects of extra food. Education about feeding chil-dren adequately during illness is particularly im- 79portant in dealing with the interaction of malnutri-tion and infection.Itmay alsoensurethatadditional food is actually consumed by the familymembers who need it most.Probably the most valuable form of nutrition ed-ucation is promotion of breastfeeding. The princi-pal gain is improved child health, but the nursingmother also benefits from conservation of ironstores (because menstruation is suppressed), bet-ter spacing of births, decreased risk of breast orovarian cancer, and possibly less postpartumbleeding. The economic benefits to families andhealth facilities can be substantial. Breast-milk sub-stitutes would cost an estimated $15 billion a yearfor the 120 million infants now relying on mother'smilk. Promotion of breastfeeding in a large Philip-pine hospital saved 8 percent of the budget by re-ducing the cost of substitute foods and the timespent in feeding by nursery staff. Such programsrequire education of both mothers and health pro-fessionals (who often discourage breastfeeding)and may require efforts to compensate for the costin time that breastfeeding imposes on women.Breastfeeding may be incompatible with some oc-cupations, but in most cases modification of work-place practices can facilitate nursing by workingmothers. MICRONUTRIENT FORTIFICATION. Fortifying thefoods people already eat raises micronutrient in-takes even without a change in eating habits. Bra-zil's national salt iodization program, which beganin 1978, greatly reduced endemic goiter in areas ofiodine deficiency. Many experimental programshave also shown the value of fortification. In Chilethe addition of iron to powdered milk and soy-based infant formula decreased anemia in nine-month-old babies from 32 to 12 percent and in fif-teen-month-olds from 30 to 6 percent. Iron is alsooften added to flour. Vitamin A can be added to avariety of foods, including sugar, milk, cereals,and monosodium making supplementaryfeeding workIn the late 1970s the government of the state of TamilNadu in south India was operating twenty-five differ-ent supplementary feeding programs. Evaluationshowed these programs to be ineffective and identifiedseveral reasons. The programs were not directed to-ward malnourished children; they provided food thatwas often not suitable for small children and was eatenby other family members; they replaced rather thansupplemented home consumption of food; they didnot educate mothers; and they failed to provideneeded nutrition-related health care. The Tamil NaduIntegrated Nutrition Project, the first phase of whichran from 1980 to 1989, was accordingly designed totarget services more effectively, to improve family nu-trition and health practices, and to improve maternaland child health services.Children ages 6-36 months were weighed eachmonth. Of every 100 children selected for feeding, 44were normal in weight but faltering in growth, 34 weremoderately malnourished and faltering, and 22 wereseverely malnourished. Supplementary feeding wasprovided immediately to those who were severely mal-nourished, and feeding for children with falteringgrowth was provided after one month (for childrenages 6-12 months) or three months (for children ages12-35 months). The children selected were fed for atleast ninety days. If they failed to gain at least 500grams in weight, they were referred to health care, andfeeding was continued for up to 180 days. Intensivenutrition education was directed at mothers of at-riskchildren. Food supplementation was also offered towomen whose children were being fed, to those whohad numerous children, and to those who were nurs-ing while pregnant.The project cut severe malnutrition in half and pre-vented many at-risk children from becoming malnour-ished. Of those receiving food supplementation, 67percent gained enough weight to graduate in ninetydays; all except the severely malnourished graduatedwithin 150 days. Because participants were fed onlywhen required, food was only 13 percent of the proj-ect's total cost, much less than is typical in supplemen-tation programs. (The initial share dropped during thecourse of the project as the number of children whoneeded feeding declined.) When the program began,in 1980, 45 to 50 percent of the children required feed-ing; by 1988 the project had brought the share down to24 percent. Selective, limited-duration supplementaryfeeding worked in Tamil Nadu because the communitynutrition workers were well trained and highly moti-vated and because mothers came to understand theimportance of feeding for healthy growth and werepleased when their children grew well. The experienceof Tamil Nadu suggests that appropriate supplemen-tary feeding is both an inexpensive and an effectiveform of nutrition education.I II 80of MSG in Indonesia cut child mortality by 30 per-cent. Whenever a food consumed by the targetpopulation can be fortified at reasonable cost, for-tification can provide the same benefits as promot-ing changes in diet and may be quicker and easier. MICRONUTRIENTSUPPLEMENTATION. Supplyingmicronutrients separately from food requires regu-lar, sometimes frequent, contact with the targetpopulation. This may make it more difficult to sus-tain high coverage. It may also make supplementsmore costly than fortification of foodsalthoughmicronutrient supplementation can be added atvery low marginal cost to immunization programsor school-based dewormirig programs. Vitamin Acan be given in capsules at intervals of one week tosix months, reducing the risk of blindness substan-tially. Vitamin A supplementation can reduce mor-tality from measles and diarrheal disease by about30 percent but has little effect on deaths from res-piratory disease.Iodine can also be provided as a supplement todiets. Oral doses of iodized oil protect for two tofour years, and injectable oil protects for three tofive years. Side effects are usually not serious andoccur mostly in older adults. Supplements forwomen of reproductive age prevent mental retar-dation in their children and reduce the risks ofinfant mortality. Iron deficiency is the most diffi-cult micronutrient shortage to combat by supple-mentation: tablets must be taken every day, andthey often cause side effects. Because these prob-lems limit compliance, supplements are usuallygiven only to pregnant women, who suffer mostfrom anemia. When the principal cause of iron de-ficiency is infection with hookworm and otherparasites, however, iron supplements are alsogiven to all those treated for a limited period afterdeworming. FOOD SUPPLEMENTATION. Programs that providefood instead of micronutrient supplements areharder to implement effectively. Inadequate tar-geting, replacement of food from the normal diet,or lack of attention to other causes of malnutritionoften mean that the food is wasted. With propertargeting and attention to changing behavior,however, some supplementation programs havebeen made to work. A program in Tamil Nadu,India, achieved remarkable gains by distributingfood only when children's growth faltered, whileproviding information to mothers continuouslythrough highly motivated community nutritionworkers (Box 4.2). This success came despite eco-nomic stagnation. There was rio improvement indistricts not participating in the program. A large-scale program in Chile substantially reduced child-hood malnutrition while increasing the use of thepublic health system. In many countries free mealsfor schoolchildren may have little effect on theirnutritional status but improve school attendanceand performance. In general, food supplementa-tion works best when it is used to motivate andeducate mothers to care for their children's health,when it can be concentrated within a crucial inter-val (during pregnancy, for example), or when itprovides additional, rionnutritional benefits.FOOD PRICE SUBSIDIES. Letting people buy basicfoodstuffs more cheaply can, in theory, increaseintake of particular foods, but there are often prac-tical problems in targeting subsidies to needyhouseholds. Targeting by locale or by commoditieseaten primarily by poor people is more efficientthan wasteful general subsidies but less precisethan targeting according to specific needs. Ineffi-ciencies in administration can eat up much of thepotential benefit. One large urban subsidy pro-gram in Brazil has often sold food for nearly thesame price as private markets, despite a nominal20 percent price reduction. When such waste isavoided, targeted subsidies can effectively transferincome to poor households. As with direct trans-fers of income or of food, subsidies are more likelyto improve nutrition and health when they arecombined with nutrition education and relatedhealth interventions. Unless that is done, sub-sidies are not cost-effective.There is a strong case for government interven-tion to improve health by improving nutrition, butnot for interfering generally in food markets, ex-cept in extraordinary conditions such as famine.Government action in nutrition has often beenwasteful because it has duplicated what privatemarkets do and has paid too little attention to thecauses of poverty and to cost-effective measuresthat improve families' knowledge and capacity tofeed themselves adequately. Reductions in mortal-ity, blindness, mental impairment, and anemia canmake fortification and supplementation extremelycost-effective, comparable to the best control mea-sures for other diseases (Table 4.4). A year ofhealthy life can be bought for less than $10 withsome micronutrient interventions and for less than$100 with programs that provide food supple-ments sparingly and combine them with behav-ioral change and health care. Improved adulthealth, more productive schooling, higher in- 81Table 4.4 Cost-effectiveness of nutrition interventions Semiannual mass dose.Deaths averted and DALYs saved are for fetal deaths.Source: Pinstrup-Andersen and others forthcoming; Levin and others forthcoming.

But the risks arehigher when women have health problems (suchas high blood pressure, heart disease, malaria, ordiabetes) that could be aggravated by pregnancy,when pregnancies come too early or too late in awoman's reproductive life, when they are tooclosely spaced or are unwanted, and when theyoccur to high-parity women (for example, thosewho have already had four or more babies).The use of family planning services by couples isan effective means of avoiding many of these fer-tility-related health risks, and it enables families toachieve their fertility goals. In many parts of theworld, fertility has been falling over time as theuse of family planning spreads (Figure 4.2). Gov-ernments can do much to help couples by promot-ing family planning as a socially acceptable prac-tice, by providing information on the health effectsof fertility regulation, by teaching couples abouteffective methods of contraception, and by remov-ing restrictions on the marketing of contraceptives.Subsidies may be justified in low-income popula-tions, in rural areas, and for programs targeted toyoung people. Nongovernmental organizationsand the private sector will often have a large role inservice provision. Ensuring access to safe abortioncan complement family planning services in im-proving health.Fertility patterns and healthBirths to very young women elevate the healthrisks to both mother and child.

THE TIMING OF BIRTHS AND CHILD HEALTH. Shortbirth intervals pose substantial risks to child healththroughout the first five years of life (Figure 4.3).In Kenya, for example, infants born within eigh-teen months of the birth of a previous child aremore than twice as likely to die as those born aftera longer interval. In Egypt the risks are more thantriple. Babies born to teenage women are also atgreater risk of dying. In Indonesia, for example,babies born to mothers age 18 and under are 50percent more likely to die than those born towomen ages 20-24.Surveys taken in twenty-five developing coun-tries in the 1980s show that, on average, nearly 35percent of births occur within twenty-four monthsof the previous birth and that many women wishEgypt Guatemala Indonesia KenyaPercentage increase in child mortality(in relation to children born 24 to 48months after the previous birth)04080120160200220 to avoid such births. If the closely spaced birthswere delayed until mothers wanted them, overallchild mortality in those countries might be re- duced by more than 20 percent. The reductioncould be as large as 30 percent in Brazil, Colombia,Ecuador, Peru, and Tunisia, where between 40 and50 percent of births are spaced too closely. CHILDBEARING AND MATERNAL HEALTH. Eachyear about 430,000 women in developing countriesdie from complications associated with childbear-ing. In the absence of obstetric care, women whohave a birth before age 18 are three times as likelyto die in childbirth as those who have a birth be-tween ages 20 and 29; for women over 34, the riskof maternal mortality is five times as high. Firstbirths are often riskier than second or third births,but as parity rises thereafter, the risk of maternalmortality also climbs. In Jamaica the risk increasesby 65 percent after the third birth. In Kenya, thePhilippines, and Zimbabwe 30 to 60 percent of 83Under 18 0o Less than 18 months18-19 018-24 monthspregnant women are estimated to be at elevatedrisk of death on account of either age or parity.Maternal deaths also arise from unsafe abortion.Almost 30 percent of pregnancies end in abortion,for a total of about 55 million induced abortions inthe world each year; 25 million of these are per-formed under unsafe conditions. The damage tomaternal health arises mainly from infection (thelong-run consequences of which include ectopicpregnancy, chronic pain, and infertility), hemor-rhage, damage to the cervix or uterus, and reactionto anesthesia and the drugs used to induce abor-tion. About 60,000 women a year are estimated todie from unsafe abortions (see Appendix tableB.8); other estimates range as high as 200,000.Treatment of abortion-related complications canconsume significant resources. In Brazil in 1988about 2 percent of all hospital admissions in thepublicly financed, privately provided health sys-tem were for abortion-related complications, andthe costs amounted to about 6 percent of all spend-ing on obstetrics and 1 percent of all hospitalspending in that system.Better health through family planning servicesFamily planning services can help women reducethe health risks from mistimed and unwantedpregnancies. In low-income populations and inrural areas there is a strong case on equity groundsfor the government to subsidize and organize theprovision of family planning services, using publicas well as nongovernmental and private channelsas appropriate. In these settings subsidized familyplanning services are often the most effective wayof transmitting family planning information to thepoor. They can also be an efficient means of im-proving the welfare of poor families, especiallywhen private medical care is unavailable. For bothreasons, family planning services are part of theminimum essential clinical package discussed inthe next chapter. Special efforts are also appropri-ate for addressing the needs of adolescents, bothbecause they tend to be particularly uninformedabout reproductive healthrisks and becausethey often misjudge the consequences of earlychildbearing.Beyond providing subsidized services to specificpopulations, the government also has a role in en-suring access to family planning services for thoseable and willing to pay. Encouraging better ser-vicesandavailabilityofmore contraceptivemethods requires various changes, including re-moval of price controls and bans on contraceptiveadvertising, easing of restrictions on the importa- 84tion of contraceptives, and abandonment of un-necessary prescription requirements. Experiencein the formerly socialist economies of Europe hasshown that all such constraints reduce contracep-tive use and often damage maternal and childhealth. Demand for many contraceptive suppliesand services can be met by private doctors andcommercial outlets, especially in towns and, forsome methods (such as condoms), in rural areas aswell.Use of contraceptives is the best way to avoidunwanted pregnancies, but it is not foolproof. Forwomen who wish to terminate their pregnancies,access to safe abortion as a complement to contra-ceptive services is also important to women'shealth. REACHING LOW-INCOME AND RURAL POPULATIONS.The health infrastructure in poor countries is oftenlimited in its ability to reach highly dispersedpopulations in rural areas. In rural Uganda, forexample, travel time to the nearest family planningfacility averages one hour, whereas it is only fif-teen minutes in rural Thailand. Long waits at thefacility are another problem; a study of clinics inseveral Latin American countries found that wait-ing times for initial visits averaged one hour andtwenty minutes. In many countries rural womenhave no access to family planning fieldworkerswho can provide information and simple services.In Guatemala, for example, 86 percent of ruralwomen live in communities without a family plan-ning fieldworker; in Egypt the figure is only33 percent. Community-based strategies havebeen used with success in some countries to reachlow-income women. In Colombia, Zaire, andZimbabwe community-based-distribution (CBD)workers serve the dual purpose of spreading infor-mation about family planning and providing themost isolated populations with family planningmethodsprimarily barrier methods, such as con-doms andfoamingtablets,butalsooralcontraceptives.Family planning services provided throughcommunity-based distribution are a highly cost-effective means of improving maternal and childhealth. In countries where both mortality and fer-tility are still relatively high, the cost per childdeath averted is extremely low. In Mali, for exam-ple, it averages about $130, which corresponds to amere $4 to $5 per DALY gained. In other countries,such as Colombia, Mexico, and Thailandwheremortality and fertility are substantially lower-CBD family planning services cost no more than$25 per DALY gained and thus remain highly cost-effective.REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE. In developing coun-tries childbearing among teenage women (ages 15-19) is common. Surveys in the 1980s in Liberia,Mali, and Uganda show that more than one in fiveteenage women had had at least one child or waspregnant at the time of the interview. In LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries 16 percent ofall births in 1992 were to teenage mothers. Adoles-cent pregnancies are often unintended and tend tobe more prevalent among low-income women. Inboth Ghana and Kenya, for example, about 40 per-cent of married teenagers who have had childrensaid theirfirst pregnancies were unintended;among unmarried teenagers the proportion of un-intended births rose to 58 percent in Ghana and 77percent in Kenya. A 1986 study of Brazilianwomen showed that 65 percent of those who be-came mothers before age 20 came from poor fami-lies (that is, those with household income belowthe national median), in contrast to 48 percent forwomen who delayed childbearing.Family life education in schools and othervenues can help teenagers make informed choicesabout sexual behavior and the prevention of sexu-ally transmitted disease (STD). Family planningservices are needed to help sexually active adoles-cents prevent pregnancies. And programs to helpteenagers cope with unintended pregnancies, es-pecially premarital ones, can be especially valu-able. In Jamaica the Women's Center Program hashad some success in helping young mothers tocomplete their schooling after childbirth and toavoid another mistimed pregnancy. IMPROVING SERVICES AND ENCOURAGING GREATERVARIETY IN METHODS. The quality of family plan-ning services in developing countries has been im-proving, but more can be done. Providing goodcounseling to clients is important, in part becausewomen's contraceptive needs change over the re-productive lifecycle. Temporary methods aremore appropriate earlier in the cycle, while perma-nent methods are more appropriate toward theend. And certain methods are more or less suitabledepending on the duration of protection desiredand on whether the woman is breastfeeding. Com-petent advice offered with sensitivity can help cli-ents choose the right method at each stage and useit effectively while also addressing their concernsabout possible side effects. Dissatisfaction withservices and contraceptive failure often causewomen to discontinue contraceptive use. In Thai-land and Colombia, where the programs offergood services, about 6 percent of users quit eachyear for these reasons; in Paraguay as many as 18percent of users discontinue annually.There is considerable scope for broadening therange and quality of contraceptive methods. India,for example, has for a long time heavily empha-sized sterilization and offered attractive financialincentives to both clients and providers. A nation-wide survey in 1986-87 showed that among non-sterilized couples seeking a temporary method ofcontraception, nearly 75 percent of those whowanted intrauterine devices (IUDs) reported fail-ure to get them, 67 percent reported failure to getcontraceptive pills, and 40 percent reported notbeing able to get condoms. In China, where steel-ring IUDs have been in widespread use, the gov-ernment, because of concern about the risk towomen's health, recently decided to switch to thesafer Copper-T IUDs. In some countries the rangeof available methods is constrained because publicsector providers are required to use products on anessential drug list and the list mistakenly excludessome contraceptive methods. Other constraints onmethod availability include excessively restrictivemedical screening requirements, unnecessary orduplicative approval procedures, packaging andlabeling requirements that perform no useful func-tion but increase costs, and import restrictions ortariffs. A study in Indonesia that surveyed a group of women eighteen months after they startedusing contraceptives found that, all else being thesame, women who failed to get their contraceptivemethod of choice were more than three times aslikely to have discontinued use as women who didreceive their preferred method.Providing an appropriate mix of contraceptivemethods can also help to reduce the spread ofSTDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Linking the provision of family planning serviceswith screening programs for STDs requires a clini-cal setting in which positive diagnoses may be fol-lowed up with treatment. The discussions of AIDSin this chapter, below, and in Chapter 5 addressthis point in more detail. ENSURING ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTION. In 1990about 40 percent of the world's population lived incountries where induced abortion was permittedon request, 25 percent lived where it was allowedonly if the woman's life was in danger, and theremaining 35 percent lived in places where abor-tion laws varied in strictness between these ex- 85In Roman \u00eda, maternal deaths shot up when abortionwas banned and fell sharply when it was legalized. Figure 4.4 Maternal mortality in Romania,1965-91 Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births180 Abortion made illegalAll causesIAA Abortion legalized N Source: Adapted from Stephenson and others 1992, whichused Romanian Ministry of Health data. tremes. In countries where abortion is illegal,women resort to clandestine, and often unsafe,abortions at high risk to their health. Legalizingabortion is inadequate for protecting maternalhealth when problems with access continue. In In-dia, for example, abortion is legal but not readilyavailable, and many women continue to rely onunsafe abortion, with detrimental effects to theirhealth.Romania's experience is the most striking exam-ple of the impact of abortion laws on maternalhealth. In 1966 the government banned abortionand contraception and took steps to enforce thelaw. The consequences were dramatic: by 1970 the 86maternal mortality rate had risen by nearly 40 per-cent above the level in 1965 (Figure 4.4). Before1966 Romania's maternal mortality rate was simi-lar to the rates in other Eastern European coun-tries. By 1989 it was at least ten times the rate ofalmost any other European country. In 1990 Ro-mania's new government legalized abortion, andthe decline in maternal mortality was immediateand even sharper than its rise following the ban:only one year after abortion was legalized, mater-nal mortality had fallen to just 40 percent of the1989 level. The percentage of all maternal deathscaused by abortion dropped from nearly 90 per-cent before the ban on abortion was lifted to justover 60 percent in 1990. COSTS AND POTENTIAL GAINS IN HEALTH. Familyplanning services,particularly when deliveredthroughcommunity-baseddistribution,areamong the most cost-effective means of improvingmaternal and child health. There is much scope forimproving services in developing countries, wheremore than one women in five who wants to avoidpregnancy is not using contraception. In Bolivia,Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, and Togo at least one inthree women ages 15-49 falls into this category.Lack of access to family planning services is onereason for not using themalthough it is certainlynot the only one. The cost of supplying familyplanning services to women without access (num-bering an estimated 120 million in the developingworld) is estimated at about $2 billion annually fordeveloping countries as a whole. Selective alloca-tion of public resources to address the needs ofthese women, particularly those in poor families,would be a cost-effective means of promoting theirwell-being, as well as that of their children. Satis-fying the expressed wish of women to space orlimit future births might each year avert as manyas 100,000 maternal deaths and 850,000 deathsamong children under 5.Reducing abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and drugsDecisions about the use of tobacco, alcohol, andother drugs are among the most important health-related choices that individuals can make. Becauseindividual options are limited by the strongly ad-dictive character of these substances, and becauseaddiction is often established in adolescence, deci-sions about the control of tobacco and other addic-tive substances are among the most importanthealth-related choices that societies can make col-lectively. In many populations prolonged cigarettesmoking is already the greatest single cause of pre-mature death. Alcohol and other drugs also con-tribute to disease and disability. The damage fromsubstance abuse is not limited to the individualsinvolved; others also suffer indirectly because ofdrunk driving, fires, passive smoking, and drug-related crime and violence.Several sorts of government policy can be usedto discourage consumption of tobacco, alcohol,and other drugs. Educating the public about theharmful effects of these substances is essential.Appropriate action will often involve special em-phasis not only on reaching school-age childrenbut also on helping adults to escape from addic-tion. Tax policies on tobacco and alcohol have alsoreduced consumption, especially by discouraginguse by young adults before they become addicted.Governments can ban all direct or indirect adver-tising or promotion of tobacco goods or trade-marks and could do the same for alcohol.TobaccoTobacco is in legal use everywhere in the world,yet it causes far more deaths than all other psycho-active substances combined. About 3 million pre-mature deaths a year (6 percent of the world total)are already attributable to tobacco smoking. If cur-rent trends continue, deaths from tobacco world-wide are projected to reach 10 million a year, ormore than 10 percent of total deaths, by the secondquarter of the next century. Tobacco is already re-sponsible for 30 percent of all cancer deaths in de-veloped countries, including deaths from cancersof the lung, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, blad-der, pancreas, and kidney. Even more people peptic has long been widespread, tobacco use isnow responsible for about 30 percent of all maledeaths in middle age. Smoking also harms thehealth of others. Among nonsmokers, exposure toenvironmental tobacco smoke increases the risk oflung cancer. And the babies of mothers whosmoke weigh, on average, 200 grams less at birththan those of nonsmokers.Per capita consumption of tobacco is decreasingslowly in industrial countries and has remainedrelatively unchanged in the formerly socialisteconomies. By contrast, per capita tobacco con-sumption is rising in many developing countriesamong both men and women and is expected toincrease by about 12 percent between 1990 and2000 (see Appendix table A.6). In China the in-crease in consumption from 500 billion cigarettesin 1978 to 1,700 billion in 1992 has produced smok-ing patterns that, if they persist, will eventuallyresult in about 2 million deaths a year from to-bacco. Similar consumption patterns exist in sev-eral other countries. If, as now, about one-third ofthe world's young adults become regular cigarettesmokers and, as in industrial countries, more thanone-third of them die prematurely because of thehabit, then, of the 120 million who reach adult lifeeach year, more than 10 percentmore than 12million a yearwill die prematurely because of to-bacco. On current smoking patterns, the chief un-certainty is not whether mortality from tobaccowill reach 12 million a year in the second quarter ofthe next century, but exactly when it will do so.Largely because of the long delay between causeand full effect, people tend to misjudge the haz-ards of tobacco. When a generation of youngadults begins to smoke, they do not witness thehigh mortality associated with their behavior untilthey reach middle age. The best-documented ex-ample of this delay is that of men in the UnitedStates, among whom the main increase in smok-ing took place before 1945. In 1945 smoking wascommon but lung cancer rare, as in developingcountries today. Over the next forty years (1945-85) the smoking habit did not change greatlyamong young men in the United States, but lungcancer in this population rose sharply (Figure 4.5).Among U.S. nonsmokers lung cancer remainedapproximately constant at a low level during 1965-85, but among smokers the rates increased twen-tyfold. In 1985 tobacco caused the large majority(110,000) of all lung cancer deaths, among bothmales and females, in the United States, as well asan even larger number (290,000) of deaths fromother diseases, for about 20 percent of 2 millionU.S. deaths. About half of those killed by tobaccowere still in middle age (35-69) and thereby lostalmosttwenty-fiveyearsofnonsmokerlifeexpectancy.Effective discouragement of addiction to tobaccoinvolves slow social changes that take place overmany years. Public education is central to this pro-cess. In China, the United Kingdom, and theUnited States, autonomous national action groupssuch as Action on Smoking and Health havehelped sustain serious efforts to alert people to thehazards of tobacco consumption and, through le-gal action, to protect the public from the harmfulhealth effects of the habit. Governments can con-tribute to the efforts of citizen groups by, for exam-ple, requiring prominent health warnings on ciga- 87The spread of cigarette smoking among U.S. maleswas followed by mounting lung cancer ratesbutonly after a decades-long delay.

Reaching adults is im-portant because over the next few decades it isthose who are already smoking who will accountfor nearly all of the tens of millions of deaths perdecade caused by tobacco. Some countries go fur-ther by banning commercial promotion of tobaccogoods and tobacco trademarks and by placing re-strictions on public smoking. Singapore has beenin the forefront of public activism in Asia: it hasprohibited advertising (since 1971), issued strongwarnings on health effects, and created smoke- 8819304050607080 85free zones. Tobacco consumption per adult ap-pears to have fallen between 1975 and 1990. China,with 300 million smokers, is following a similarpath: in 1992 it banned most tobacco advertising,mandated health education for youths, prohibitedsmoking in many public places, and required pro-gressive reduction of tar levels. In support ofcountries' efforts to discourage tobacco consump-tion, the World Bank in 1992 set forth a new policyon tobacco (Box 4.3).Tobacco has traditionally been taxed, althoughprobably because it is a good source of revenuerather than for the health gains. Taxation reducesconsumption, especially among the young. In in-dustrial countries a 10 percent price increase re-duces consumption by about 4 percent in the gen-eral population and about 13 percent amongadolescents. Besides having few resources, mostadolescent smokers probably have not been smok-ing long enough to be fully addicted and so tend tobe more price sensitive than other smokers. In In-dia cigarette sales declined by 15 percent after theexcise tax on most of the popular cigarette brandsmore than doubled in 1986. In Papua New Guineaa 10 percent increase in the tobacco tax reducedconsumption by 7 percent.Alcohol and illegal drugsAlcohol-related diseases affect 5 to 10 percent ofthe world's population each year and accountedfor about 3 percent of the global burden of diseasein 1990. Of the 2 million alcohol-related deathsthat occur worldwide each year, about 50 percentstem from cirrhosis of the liver, about 35 per-cent from cancer of the liver or esophagus, 10percent from alcohol dependence syndrome, and5 percent from injuries caused by motor vehicles.The problems caused by alcohol abuse consumescarce medical resources and extend beyond thedamage that drinkers do to themselves. In manyLatin American countries in the 1980s, 20 percentof all hospital and emergency room admissionswere alcohol-related. In Papua New Guinea morethan 85 percent of fatal road accidents in the 1980sinvolved either drunk drivers or drunk pedes-trians. Within households, drinking often leads toassault and injury, although the scale of the prob-lem is hard to quantify.Alcohol consumption is stable in the industrialworld but is on the rise in many developing coun-tries. Between 1960 and 1981 annual beer con-sumption per capita rose from 12 liters to 135 litersin Gabon and from 3 liters to 20 liters in C\u00f4ted'Ivoire. Total world production of beer nearlyBox 4.3World Bank policy on tobaccoIn 1992, in recognition of the adverse effects of tobaccoconsumption on health, the World Bank articulated aformal policy on tobacco. The policy contains five mainpoints.The World Bank's activities in the health sectorincluding sector work, policy dialogue, and lendingdiscourage the use of tobacco products.The World Bank does not lend directly for, investin, or guarantee investments or loans for tobacco pro-duction, processing, or marketing. However, in thefew countries that are heavily dependent on tobacco asa source of income and of foreign exchange earnings(for example, those where tobacco accounts for morethan 10 percent of exports) and especially as a source ofincome for poor farmers and farmworkers, the WorldBank treats the subject within the context of respond-ing most effectively to these countries' developmentrequirements. The World Bank seeks to help thesecountries diversify away from tobacco.To the extent practicable, the World Bank does notlend indirectly for tobacco production activities, al-though some indirect support of the tobacco economymay occur as an inseparable part of a project that has abroader set of objectives and outcomes (for example,rural roads).Unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco, to-bacco-processing machinery and equipment, and re-lated services are included on the negative list of im-ports in loan agreements and so cannot be includedamong imports financed under loans.Tobacco and tobacco-related producer or con-sumer imports may be exempt from borrowers' agree-ments with the Bank to liberalize trade and reduce tar-iff levels. doubled between 1970 and 1989, far surpassingpopulation growth, with much of the increase oc-curring in developing regions.As with alcohol, abuse of illegal drugs causesserious health and social problems. Individualsrun the risk of death from infectious, circulatory,respiratory, and digestive diseases, as well as fromviolence, overdose, and AIDS. Users of cocaine,especially in the form of \"crack,\" often sufferacute cardiovascular problems that require emer-gency room services, and the babies of pregnantusers of cocaine are often born with severe healthproblems.Reliable data on trends and patterns in illegaldrug use are scarce. Users typically fall in the agegroup 15-44, although most are in their mid-twen-ties. In the past decade the production and con-sumption of illicit drugs, especially cocaine, ap-pear to have increased considerably worldwide. Insome developing countries the use of psychoactivedrugs such as inhalants is also a serious problem.Taxes and judicial penalties have been used todiscourage alcohol abuse. A 1982 U.S. study indi-cated that an increase in the liquor tax of about$3.50 (at 1991 prices) per gallon equivalent of purealcohol would lower demand enough to reducethe incidence of liver cirrhosis by 5 percent in theshort run and perhaps twice as much in the longrun. In industrial countries mandatory licensesanctions on drunk drivers are estimated to de-crease traffic fatalities by about 10 percent; the im-position of a minimum legal drinking age and theassessment of relatively large mandatory fines(that is, about one to two months' wages) are esti-mated to reduce traffic fatalities by about 5 per-cent. Mandatory jail sentences for drunk drivinghave also been weakly effective. The effect of in-formation campaigns concerning alcohol con-sumption has not been quantified, but there is evi-dence that in countries where alcohol is legal butcommercial promotion is not, per capita alcoholconsumption is 30 percent lower than elsewhereand deaths from motor vehicle accidents are 10percent fewer. As a successful alcohol rehabilita-tion program in south India demonstrates, com-munity efforts are generally more effective thanmedical interventions in helping individuals toovercome alcohol dependence, in part because ofthe importanceofsustained encouragement,which is more easily offered by the communitythan by health service institutions.Prohibitionisa common approach to drugabuse. In the United States prohibition as an ap-proach to control of alcohol failed early in this cen-tury. It appears to be having, at best, limited suc-cess in controlling use of other drugs now. In othersettings, including Malaysia and Singapore, prohi-bition coupled with a mandatory death penalty fordrug trafficking appears to have been more effec-tive. The successes achieved in controlling the useof alcohol and tobaccothrough restrictions onpromotion and access, high taxation, rehabilitationof addicts, and public educationmay also be rele-vant for efforts against other drugs. For alcoholand tobacco, past successes with these measuresshould spur efforts toward full implementation. 89Environmental influences on healthThe environment in which people live has a hugeinfluence on their health. For poor people andpoor regions, it is the household environment thatcarries the greatest risks to health. By providinginformation, reducing poverty, and facilitating andstimulating private sector action, governments candeploy potent mechanisms to improve this envi-ronment. Potential health gains from these effortstotal nearly 80 million DALYs a year in developingcountries. Other government actions, designed toameliorate or remedy unsafe conditions in theworkplace and pollution of the ambient environ-ment, could save 36 million and 8 million DALYs ayear, respectively. Finally, feasible reductions inthe toll taken by road traffic injuries could avertthe loss of 6 million DALYs a year.The household environmentPoor households generally live in a domestic envi-ronment with high health risks caused by poorsanitation and inadequate water supply (often Table 4.5 Estimated burden of disease from poor household environments in demographicallydeveloping countries, 1990, and potential reduction through improved household services 90compounded by poor hygiene), inadequate gar-bage disposal and drainage, heavy indoor air pol-lution, and crowding. The diseases associatedwith poor household environments occur mainlyin developing countries, where they account fornearly 30 percent of the total burden of disease(Table 4.5). Modest improvements in householdenvironments would avert almost a quarter of thisburden, mostly as a result of reductions in diar-rhea and respiratory infections. WATER AND SANITATION. About 1.3 billion peoplein the developing world lack access to clean andplentiful water, and nearly 2 billion people lack anadequate system for disposing of their feces (Fig-ure 4.6). Feces deposited near homes, contami-nated drinking water (sometimes caused by poorlydesigned or maintained sewerage systems), fishfrom polluted rivers and coastal waters, and agri-cultural produce fertilized with human waste areall health hazards. Water quantity is as importantas water quality. Washing hands after defecationand before preparing food is of particular impor- * Less than one.Note: The demographically developing group consists of the demographic regions Sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Other Asia and islands,Latin America and the Caribbean, and Middle Eastern crescent.The diseases listed are those for which there is substantial evidente of a relationship with the household environment and which are listed in Appendix B. Examples of excluded conditions are violence related to crowding (because of lack of evidence) and guinea worm infection related to poor water supply (not listed in Appendix B).Estimates derived from the product of the efficacy of the interventions and the proportion of the burden of disease that occurs among the exposed. The efficacy estimates assume the implementation of improvements in sanitation, water supply, hygiene, drainage, garbage disposal,indoor air pollution, and crowding of the kind being made in poor communities in developing countries.Includes diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.Diseases within the tropical cluster most affected by the domestic environment are schistosomiasis, South American trypanosomiasis, andBancroftian filariasis.Based on very inadequate to poor household (millions ofinterventions(millions of(DALYs per home 410 *0.1 All the above 338-7919.4Many people worldwide still lack safe water and adequate sanitation.

The lack of watersupply and sanitation is the primary reason whydiseases transmitted via feces are so common indeveloping countries. The most important of thesediseases, diarrhea and intestinal worm infections,account for an annual burden of 117 millionDALYs, or 10 percent of the total burden of diseasein developing countries. In addition, an inade-quate water supply increases the risk of schis-tosomiasis, skin and eye infections, and guineaworm disease (Box 4.4).INDOOR AIR POLLUTION. Indoor air pollution,which World Development Report 1992 identified asone of the four most critical global environmentalproblems, probably exposes more people world-wide to important air pollutants than does pollu-tion in outdoor air. Whereas air in such cities asDelhi, India, and Xian, China, contains a daily av-erage of 500 micrograms per cubic meter of totalsuspended particulates, smoky houses in Nepaland Papua New Guinea have peak levels of 10,000or more. Rural people in developing countries mayreceive as much as two-thirds of the global expo-sure to particulates. Women and young childrensuffer the greatest exposure.Indoor air pollution contributes to acute respira-tory infections in young children, chronic lung dis-ease and cancer in adults, and adverse pregnancyoutcomes (such as stillbirths) for women exposedduring pregnancy. Acute respiratory infections,principally pneumonia, are the chief killers ofyoung children, causing a loss of 119 millionDALYs a year, or 10 percent of the total burden ofdisease in developing countries. Data from theGambia, Nepal, South Africa, the United States,and Zimbabwe suggest that reducing indoor airpollution from very high to low levels could poten-tially halve the incidence of childhood pneumonia.Adults can suffer chronic damage to the respira-tory system from indoor pollution.

It has been suc-cessfully eliminated from the Central Asian republicsand from Iran, where the last case was seen in the1970s, and it has spontaneously disappeared frommost of the Middle East and from several African coun-tries, such as the Gambia and Guinea. There are nowprobably fewer than a million cases worldwide.The disease does not kill people, but it causes painand disability to its victims for several weeks in theyear as the 60-centimeter-long female worm emergesfrom a blister, usually on the leg. In some cases thedisability is permanent. The worms usually emerge inthe early rainy season, the time when the incapacitatedvictims would otherwise be planting and weeding theircrops. Children whose parents are stricken by guineaworm are more likely to be malnourished in the follow-ing year.Because dracunculiasis can only be caught by drink-ing infected water, improving the water supply is animportant preventive measure. Health education isalso essential. Villagers need to be persuaded to stayout of sources of drinking water when they haveguinea worm blisters on their legs and to filter theirwater with a cloth if they do not have a safe watersource.Eradication of dracunculiasis by the end of 1995 hasbeen adopted as an international goal. Pakistan mayhave achieved eradication in 1992, and Cameroon, In-dia, and Senegal may do so in 1993. Between 1987 and1992 cases reported per year fell from 653,000 to201,000 in Nigeria, from 180,000 to 33,000 in Ghana,and from 17,000 to 900 in India. In general, these ad-vances have been achieved through \"vertical\" pro-gramsthat is, programs specific to dracunculiasis.The eradication of the disease from the poor, sparselypopulated endemic countries in West Africa will, how-ever, require integrated programs in which the re-sources available for guinea worm control are sharedwith other activities, such as immunization. A by-prod-uct of guinea worm eradication will be community-based surveillance systems, which can be used by com-munities to monitor and improve their own health andby public health workers to combat other diseases,such as polio. shown that up to half of adult women (few ofwhom smoke) suffer from chronic lung and heartdiseases. Nonsmoking Chinese women exposed toindoor coal smoke (which is especially harmful)have a risk of lung cancer similar to that of menwho smoke lightly. Comprehensive improvementin indoor air quality in the developing countriesmight avert a loss of 24 million DALYs each yearby reducing the burden of acute respiratory infec-tions and chronic respiratory diseases by 15 per-cent and of respiratory tract cancers by 10 percent(Table 4.5).HousiNG. In many cities 30 to 60 percent of thepopulation live in overcrowded and deterioratingshanties, tenements, and boardinghouses. Crowd-ing is associated with increased airborne infectionand personal violence. Poor structures lead togreater exposure to heat, cold, noise, dust, rain,insects, and rodents. And housing locations ateoften unhealthy because of, for example, poordrainage.POLICIES FOR IMPROVING THE HOUSEHOLD ENVI-RONMENT. The most powerful forces for reducingdomestic risks to health are rising incomes andincreased educationfor household members.Higher incomes make it possible for people to af-92ford the household improvements, including bet-ter water and sanitation services, that they desire.As people acquire more education, their hygieneimproves, and their responsiveness to public in-formation programs increases. To support house-holds' efforts, governments have an importantrole in setting and enforcing appropriate environ-mental standards and disseminating informationon, for example, the health benefits of good hy-giene and the effects of exposure (especially ofbabies) to smoke. Governments should also con-centrate on strengthening securityoftenure(which is essential for encouraging households toinvest in their housing) and on establishing a legal,regulatory, and administrative framework that fa-cilitates responsive, accountable, and efficient pro-vision, often by private suppliers, of services thatpeople want and are willing to pay for. And theyshould refrain from supplying services directlyand from granting indiscriminate, widespreadsubsidies. Such subsidies are often captured bywealthier consumers, go for improvements thathouseholds would make anyway, or encourageconsumption patternsthat are detrimental tohealth. (For example, subsidies for coal used incooking lead to more indoor air pollution thanwould be the case with cleaner liquid or gas fuels.)Past experience in water and sanitation illus-trates the limitations of direct government provi-sion of household services. Despite technical prog-ress in developing affordable engineering solu-tions to the problems of water, sanitation, drain-age, and housing, the delivery and maintenance ofthese services, especially by governments, havebeen disappointing. At the end of the Interna-tional Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation De-cade (the 1980s), most people in the poorer regionsof the world still lacked sanitation, and the num-ber of urban residents without water had not beenreduced.Supply-side failures are largely caused by ineffi-cient and unresponsive public sector monopolieswhich, in the water sector, typically provide subsi-dized services at between one-third and two-thirdsof the full economic cost. Massive public invest-ments, often supported by the donor communityand the World Bank, have been made in public orquasi-public agencies responsible for the deliveryand maintenance of household services. The net re-sult has often been bloated public agencies with lowaccountability to their customers and few incen-tives for improving efficiency; a middle class that isincreasingly well served with subsidized services; a -poorer class that receives little or no service; and aripe environment for political patronage.The poor usually miss out on both services andsubsidies. They suffer the substantial health con-sequences described in Table 4.5 and pay highprices for inadequate services. In Lima poor peo-ple may pay $3 for a cubic meter of contaminatedwater collected by bucket from a private vendor,while the middle class pays 30 cents per cubic me-ter for treated water provided on tap in theirhouses by the publicly subsidized water company.Broadly based subsidies are not necessary forensuring access to safe water and sanitation. Inmost urban communities households are willing topay the full costs of water service and often the fullcost of sanitation services. Willingness to pay forwater may be high in rural areas as well, but whatpeople can afford is commonly not enough tocover the high costs of supply. Subsidy may bejustifiedin such situations. But the rationaleshould be primarily one of redistribution: a societymay choose to provide cheap water or other ser-vices to the poor as one of many alternative meansof improving their welfare. Health benefits alonedo not generally provide a rationale for public sub-sidy of water and sanitation (see Box 4.5). Box 4.5The costs and benefits of investments in water supply and sanitationPeople want safe water and good sanitation and arewilling to pay for these services, especially for plentifulwater in or very near the home. Improvements in wa-ter supply raise productivity through savings in thefuel used to boil polluted water and, even more impor-tant, through the time and energy savings for womenwho have to collect water from distant sources. Provi-sion of public handpumps in Imo State, Nigeria, re-duced the median time that each household spent onwater collection in the dry season from six hours a dayto forty-five minutes. In Lesotho, not an especially drycountry, the benefits in time saved alone are sufficientto justify investments in rural water supply. Sanitationimprovements have high amenity value, making possi-ble a cleaner and more pleasant environment.The costs of water supply and sanitation servicesvary by technology, population density, the hydrologicand geologic environment, and design standards..De-sign standards for water supply can range from onehandpump per 250 people, supplying 20 liters per per-son per day, to multiple-tap in-house connections thatsupply several hundred liters of fully treated water perperson per day. Design standards for sanitation canvary from a pit latrine to flush toilets connected to asewerage system, with downstream treatment prior todischarge. The cost of water and sanitation services canrange from $15 per person per year for simple ruralsystems to $200 for full-fledged urban systems. Poorhouseholds cannot afford the design standards of in-dustrial countries, but such standards are not neces-sary on health grounds. Completely eliminating fecalbacteria requires expensive chlorination, but low con-centrations present little health hazard and should betolerated.If households pay the total cost of water and sanita-tion services because of the productivity and amenitybenefits, substantial health gains are an added bonusachieved at no cost per DALY gained. When willing-ness to pay is much less than costs, it is usually a mis-take to justify subsidies on the basis of health benefitsalone. First, such subsidies compromise the demand-driven approach to service provision (that is, provisionof services that people want and are willing to pay for);lack of accountability and inefficiency are the inevitableconsequences. And second, if publicly financed invest-ments in these services are being considered for healthreasons, it should be noted that such investments gen-erally cost more per DALY gained than other healthinterventions recommended in this Report. 9394Box 4.6Environmental and household control of mosquito vectorsDiseases transmitted by insect vectors account forlosses of 44 million DALYs worldwide each year (35million in Sub-Saharan Africa), or 3 percent of theworld burden (12 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa). Al-though widespread application of insecticides is help-ing to control river blindness in West Africa (see Box1.1) and Chagas' disease in South America, it is nolonger the mainstay of vector control against other dis-eases. Emphasis has shifted to a range of targeted bio-logical, physical, and behavioral approaches supportedby insecticides when necessary. Two examples aregiven here.Impregnated bednetsBednets impregnated with a pyrethroid insecticide oflow mammalian toxicity form lethal traps for mosqui-toes attracted by the carbon dioxide and body odoremitted by the occupants. In Sichuan Province, China,up to 2.25 million netsalready owned by nearly allhouseholdershave been treated each year since 1987.If nothing else, the cost is much lower than sprayingthe same houses with DDT. In Emei County, Sichuan,the number of malaria cases had been steady at about4,000 between 1980 and 1986. After bednet treatmentbegan, the number declined steadily, to 352 in 1991. Inthe Gambia a combination of net treatment and chemo-prophylaxis, carried out by primary health care person-nel, reduced overall child mortality by 63 percent.Polystyrene beadsThe application of polystyrene beads to pit latrines hasproved successful in reducing the breeding of Culexmosquitoes and the transmission of filariasis. Thebeads form a floating layer that discourages egg layingand suffocates any mosquito larvae that do hatch. Inthe town of Makunduchi (population 12,000)inZanzibar, Tanzania, a combination of polystyrene-beadapplication and mass drug treatment of the populationbetween January 1988 and June 1989 virtually elimi-nated biting by infective mosquitoes, and the propor-tion of people infected by filariasis fell from 50 to 10percent. By January 1993 the proportion of people in-fected had fallen to 3 percent. The polystyrene beadlayers remained intact and effective for several yearsand were disrupted only by exceptional flooding.In Zanzibar Town researchers are studying whetherit is better to make beads freely available so that house-holders can apply them to their own pits or to havetrained teams identify and treat all pits requiring treat-ment. In Dar es Salaam polystyrene beads are beingused to control Culex nuisance biting and thereby in-crease public acceptance of house spraying against theAnopheles vectors of malaria. The effectiveness of theCulex control measures is evidenced by declining salesof mosquito coils in local shops. In Madras, India, poly-styrene beads are being applied to water tanks to con-trol the local vectors of malaria and dengue; the qualityof the water is not affected. An important policy issue, on which there is anapparent tension between health objectives andthe demand-driven approach advocated here andin World Development Report 1992, concerns the se-quencing and packaging of investments in waterand sanitation. Given the patterns of householdchoice, a demand-driven approach will usuallymean that provision of water supply services pre-cedes that of sanitation services. It is frequentlyargued that this sequence would produce fewhealth benefits because rapid increases in wateruse can overwhelm existing waste disposal capac-ity and because health benefits are maximized onlywhen households utilize both better water andbetter sanitation services. These arguments areplausible, but experiences in many countries sug-gest that close adherence to the demand-drivenapproach remains appropriate in most places, in-cluding low-income settings. First, where rapid in-crease in water use is likely to cause environmentaland health problems in the absence of householdsanitation servicesas in urban areasthe de-mand for improved sanitation has invariably risenautomatically as the demand for water services issatisfied. Second, where the demand-driven ap-proach has not been followed, service provisionhas almost always been characterized by ineffi-ciency and lack of accountability. For the provisionof water supply and wastewater collection ser-vices,therefore,the demand-driven approachshouldbecompromisedonlyinrarecircumstances.Households are less willing to pay for the cost oftrunk sewers and treatment of excreta and waste-water. Because these investments benefit thewhole community and are important for environ-mental quality and health, there is potentially acase for using public funds to finance them. A fewother situations may also justify direct governmentaction or subsidies. Householders tend to under-value such investments as areawide pollutionabatement, vector control involving actions withinhouseholds (see Box 4.6), and research and devel-opment. There may thus be grounds for publicsubsidy or other interventions in these areas. Itwill often be difficult to disentangle environmentaland health benefits, and judgments will be neces-sary concerning the use of public funds.Large institutional and cultural shifts are neededto create an efficient system for allocating scarcepublic and private resources to improve the house-hold environment. Many developing countrieshave inheritedand then elaborated onthe for-mer colonial powers' worst traditions of publicsector inertia and professional inflexibility. En-couragingly, however, private sector involvementis increasing rapidly in both industrial and devel-oping countries. SODECI, the privately run utilityin Abidjan, is considered one of the best-run watercompanies in Africa. EMOS, the utility that servesSantiago, has used private sector contracts forsuch functions as meter reading, pipe mainte-nance, billing, and vehicle leasing and is one of themost efficient utilities in Latin America. The role ofcommunity organizations and NGOs may also besignificant, particularly in drainage and sanitationimprovements. In cities such as Karachi and S\u00e3oPaulo, community groups have significantly accel-erated the provision of low-cost water supply andsanitation services to poor households, as well ashelping to maintain and manage local services.The occupational environmentMany women work in the home and thus sufferdisproportionately from the health risks in thehousehold environment just described. Both menand women may also encounter health risks inworkplaces outside the home. A burden of 36 mil-lion DALYs, or 3 percent of the global burden ofdisease, is caused each year by preventable inju-ries and deaths in high-risk occupations and bychronic illness stemming from exposure to toxicchemicals, noise, stress, and physically debilitat-ing work patterns (Table 4.6).The International Labour Office has estimatedthat the cost of occupational injuries and associ-ated production losses in a sample of industrialcountries is between 1 and 4 percent of GNP. Indeveloping countries this proportion is likely to begreater because accident rates tend to be higher.Rates of fatal occupational injuries among con-struction workers, for example, are more than tentimes higher in Kenya and Thailand than in Fin-land. Agriculture, which employs more than halfof all adults in most developing countries, isamong the world's most dangerous occupations.Not only do agricultural workers suffer injuries,but they are also exposed to disease-carrying ani-mals and to poisonous agrochemicals. Health risksare high in other sectors as well.

Small workplaces may have espe-cially low standards of safety, yet such risks areoften overlooked by government agencies andtrade unions alike. A survey of companies inSamud Prakhan, Thailand, found that smallerplants, with fewer than fifty workers, had substan-tially lower levels of sanitation, health services,safety provisions, and environmental control mea-sures than larger enterprises. Workers sufferedmore than twice as much noise and a third morelead fumes and vapors. And they experienced sig-nificant work-related health problems: 22 percenthad lead poisoning or absorption, 27 percent hadupper respiratory symptoms, and 6 percent hadchronicobstructive pulmonarydisease,eventhough most workers were below age 30.Alleviating occupational risk depends on safetyeducation for workers and managers, use of ap-propriate equipment and technology, and soundmanagement practices. Governments can encour-age these initiatives through legislation and regu-lation, financial incentives, investment in educa-tion,and research and development. Whereworker organizations are strong, they have playeda major role in identifying and reducing occupa-tionalrisks.Tripartiteagreementsbetweenworkers, employers, and governments can lead tospeedy progress.The ambient environmentRadiation and pollution of air and water are addi-tional health hazards. Since there is no market forclean air and water, government action is fre-quently justified. AIR POLLUTION. Many cities suffer from air p01-lution caused by industry, power plants, roadtransport, and domestic use of coal. About 1.3 bil-lion urban residents worldwide are exposed to airpollution levels above recommended limits. Airquality in the established market economies hasgenerally improved in the past two decades. But inmany developing countries and in the formerly so-cialist economies, air quality has deteriorated be-cause of rising industrial activity, increasing powergeneration, and the congestion of streets withpoorly maintained motor vehicles that use leadedfuel.Air pollution damages the human respiratoryand cardiorespiratory systems in various ways.The elderly, children, smokers, and those withchronic respiratory difficulties are most vulner- 96able. Under the assumption that achievable reduc-tions in urban air pollution can prevent 5 percentof all infectious and chronic respiratory disease,these reductions could avert a burden of 8 millionDALYs each year, or 0.6 percent of the global bur-den of disease (Table 4.6). Local impacts and theeffects on especially vulnerable groups can bemuch greater (Box 4.7).Lead poisons many systems in the body and isparticularly dangerous to children's developingbrains and nervous systems. Airborne lead con- centrations are high in polluted urban environ-ments, where lead comes mainly from the exhaustof vehicles burning leaded gasoline. Elevated leadlevels in children have been associated with im-paired neuropsychologic development as mea-sured by loss of IQ, poor school performance, andbehavioral difficulties.WATER POLLUTION. Newly industrialized coun- tries, as well as many industrial countries, havepolluted or are polluting their rivers, lakes, andcoastal waters with a variety of chemical and bio-logical wastes of both industrial and domestic ori-gin. The practice of letting raw wastewater fromindustry and residential areas flow into rivers or the sea is common but unwise. Investment in pre-venting it may be justified because of the possiblysevere local health consequences (as illustrated inBox 4.8) and because generalized water pollution,by reducing the number of water sources availablefor domestic supply, can foreclose cost-effectiveoptions for responding to demand for domesticservices.RADIATION. Individuals are exposed to naturalbackground ionizing radiation and to radiationused for medical and dental diagnosis. Only a tinyamount of additional radiation comes from safelyoperated nuclear power stations or other installa-tions (roughly one-thousandth of the backgrounddose for those living within 50 kilometers of a nu-clear power station). Current evidence suggeststhat the health effects of this radiation on the gen-eral population are extremely small or nonexistent.Accidents and occupational risks to workers in nu-clear industries and to miners of radioactive ores,however, are different matters. The consequencesof the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl,Ukraine, in 1986 have yet to be fully documentedbut are undoubtedly large. (The risk of such acci-dents is particularly high in the formerly socialisteconomies because of their large number of poorlydesigned nuclear facilities.) Standards and safe-IBox 4.7Air pollution and health in Central EuropeContrary to expectations, public ownership and cen-trally planned economies have neither controlled poi-lution nor brought health benefits to the populations ofthe formerly socialist economies. The countries of thisregion face a variety of serious environmental healththreats, of which the greatest are particulates and gasesin air, lead in air and soil, and nitrates and metals inwater. A substantial gap in health status between thesecountries and those of Western Europe has opened upsince the early 1960s: life expectancy is roughly fiveyears shorter in the formerly socialist economies, andmortality ratesin middle-aged males are roughlydouble. There has been considerable speculationamong scientists and the public in Central Europeabout how much of this health gap is attributable toenvironmental pollution.Air pollution is the environmental factor that has hadthe greatest negative effect on health in Central Eu-rope. Of the many air pollution 'hotspots\" through-out the region, the worst-affected area is the 'BlackTriangle,\" which covers northern Bohemia and Mo-ravia, Silesia, and Saxony and has a population ofroughly 6.5 million. In August 1991 the three govern-ments involvedthe Czech Republic, Germany, andPolandand the Commission of the European Com-munities formed a Working Group for NeighbourlyCooperation on Environmental Issues to deal with theextremely high levels of air pollutants in the area.The overall effect of air pollution on mortality in theCzech Republic has been estimated using data on thedistribution of the population, the ambient levels ofparticulates and sulfur dioxide, and the relationshipbetween excess mortality and pollution. This relation-ship is derived from studies in Canada, the UnitedKingdom, and the United States that indicate excessmortality of 1 percent for every 10 micrograms per cu-bic meter of particulates and sulfur dioxide. These esti-mates suggest air pollution causes up to 3 percent oftotal mortality in the Czech Republic and is responsiblefor roughly 9 percent in the gap in mortality rates be-tween the Czech Republic and Western Europe. Simi-lar estimates have been obtained for Silesia in Poland.The effect of air pollution on mortality is greater forcertain causes of death in specific age groups. A recentstudy of postneonatal respiratory mortality showed arate 2.4 times higher in the most polluted districts ofthe Czech Republic than in the least polluted, afteradjusting for a battery of socioeconomic factors. Anincrease in particulates of 25 micrograms per cubic me-ter was associated with an increase in postneonatal res-piratory mortality of 58 percent.The contribution of air pollution to morbidity in theCzech Republic is likely to be considerably greater thanthe effect on mortality and to have larger economicconsequencesthroughhealthexpenditures,lostschooling, and lost productivity. Children in heavilypolluted areas may suffer twice the rates of respiratorymorbidity of those in clean areas. Overall, air pollutionmay be responsible for up to one-quarter of all respira-tory morbidity in Czech children.\"Hotspots\" of lead exposure exist throughout theformerly socialist economies. Average blood levels ofmore than 25 micrograms per deciliter in children havebeen reported in, for example, Pribram, Czech Repub-lic, and Katowice, Poland. In comparison with normallevels, these higher levels could double the proportionof children requiring special education and halve theproportion in the exceptionally gifted group (IQ greaterthan 130). guards against accidents and occupational hazardshave been greatly improved, but risks may re-main, and continued research and vigilance arerequired. Putative links of certain cancers with ex-posure to radon in houses and with electromagne-tic fields created by high-voltage cables are beinginvestigated in several industrial countries.GLOBAL THREATS. Depletion of the atmosphericozone layer and global warming pose potentialthreats of unknown magnitude to health. Intern\u00e3-tional agreements are limiting or will limit the re-lease of chlorine compounds that can harm theozone layer and of the greenhouse gases that con-tribute to global warming. The societies that willsuffer least from these global changes are thosethat are wealthier (and therefore able to invest inappropriate coping strategies) and healthier. Thebest preparation at the national level for these un-certain future events is therefore to pursue soundeconomic and health policies in the medium term. IMPROVING THE AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT. Improv-ing health is only one of several reasons why soci-eties may choose to invest in a cleaner environ-ment. The policies and actions needed to clean upthe air in a given city or area will depend on theorigins of the pollution at that site. In most cities indeveloping countries motor vehicles are a signifi-cant source of air pollution and need to be specifi-cally targeted. A few cities in the developingworld, among them Bangkok and Mexico City, arepursuing systematic policies to reduce motor vehi-cle emissions, and their experience will be valuable 97Box 4.8Pollution in Japan: prevention would have been better and cheaper than cureIn the 1950s and 1960s Japan experienced a period ofrapid industrialization and economic growth, hut littleattention was paid to the environmental consequences.The result was high levels of pollutants in the air, wa-ter, and soil in some areas and several infamous out-breaks of disease. Strong corrective action was taken inthe 1970s and 1980s to redress the severest problems.Three conclusions emerge from the examples given be-low: allowing the release of toxic substances into theenvironment can lead to serious health consequencesand economic losses; prevention, as Japan is now do-ing, is less costly than cleaning up; and taking correc-tive action now is less costly than allowing problems topersist.Case 1: sulfur dioxide in the airBetween 1956 and 1973 one of Japan's largest petro-chemical complexes was constructed at Yokkaichi City.By 1960 air pollution was causing local concern, and by1963 one-hour average sulfur dioxide levels exceeded2,800 micrograms per cubic meter, far above WHO'ssuggested maximum of 350 micrograms per cubic me-ter. In 1967 local residents successfully sued six com-panies, claiming medical costs and compensation forlost income. Seven percent of the total population ofthe district were certified to have been medically af-fected by ambient air pollution. Increasingly stringentpollution measures were introduced starting in 1970,and by 1976 sulfur dioxide levels were in compliancewith local standards.Air pollution control costs since 1971includingtechnical installations and their operation, monitoring,and creation of environmental buffer zoneshave been$114 million a year. Without this investment, however,medical expenses and compensation would have beenmore than $160 million a year.Case 2: mercury in the waterAt the turn of the century Minamata was a sceniccoastal town of 12,000 people who made their livingfrom wood products, oranges, and fish. In 1908 a fertil-izer plant was established that eventually became theChisso Corporation, one of Japan's largest manufac-turers of chemicals. By the 1920s compensation fordamage to fisheries had already become an issue, andin 1956 patients with a severe neurological affliction,later to be called Minamata disease, were observed. In1968, following extensive research, the disease waslinked to the ingestion of seafood containing high con-centrations of methyl mercury, a compound dis-charged into Minamata Bay by the Chisso Corporationas a by-product of the manufacture of acetaldehyde.The discharge of methyl mercury peaked in 1959; itended in 1968 when the company ceased production ofacetaldehyde, but by then the floor of the bay and itsaquatic life had become heavily contaminated. Startingin 1974, 1.5 million cubic meters of polluted sedimentwere dredged and removed.By 1991, 2,248 people (1,004 of whom had died) hadbeen certified as suffering from Minamata disease andwere eligible for compensation. An additional 2,000people are pursuing claims for compensation. Had dis-charge of mercury continued, the estimated annualcosts of the damage, including patient treatment andcompensation, sediment dredging, and losses to fish-eries,would have been$97millionayear.Ifacetaldehyde production had continued, pollutionabatement through in-plant waste recycling wouldhave cost only $1 million a year.Case 3: cadmium in the soilIn the late 1940s a disease characterized by extremegeneralized pain, kidney damage, and loss of bonestrength appeared in the Jinzu River Basin. The dis-ease, which primarily afflicted women, was called itai-itai (''It hurts, it hurts!'') after the cries of the sufferers.Two decades of research led, in 1968, to the conclusionthat the cause was chronic cadmium poisoning, whichwas traced to the effluent from the Mitsui Mining andSmelting Company located in the upper reaches of thebasin. The route for the cadmium poisoning was fromriver water to irrigation water to soil to rice. By 1991,129 people had been certified as itai-itai sufferers, and116 of them had died.A major program of soil restoration was initiated in1979. By 1992, 36 percent of the contaminated area of1,500 hectares had been treated. Had the further re-lease of cadmium not been prevented, the annual costsfrom medical compensation, agricultural losses, andsoil restoration would have been $19 million a year. Thecosts of prevention were $5 million a year. in designing the next generation of programs. Suc-cessful policies include incentives and regulationsto improve fuel quality, enhance engine perfor-mance and maintenance, and reduce traffic vol-ume. Most industrial countries and an increasingnumber of developing countries have set limits on 98lead levels in gasoline and are using price differen-tials to encourage consumers to switch to lead-freeproducts. Lead concentrations in the air havefallen by 50 percent or more in response to thesemeasures, and average blood lead levels in urbanareas have also declined substantially.Clean technologies and practices can reduce lo-cal industrial pollution levels even as output ex-pands. To encourage adoption of such technolo-gies, governments need to pursue policies thatimprove the efficiency with which energy is used.Such policies include the elimination of subsidiesfor power generation and, in many countries, forvehicle fuels and coal. Efficient reforms help re-duce pollution while raising a country's economicoutput. Policy options are described in full in WorldDevelopment Report 1992.The road transport environmentMotor vehicle crashes are responsible for an in-creasing burden of injury and death in developingcountries. Each year throughout the world roadtraffic injuries cause a loss of 32 million DALYs, ormore than 2 percent of the global burden of dis-ease (Table 4.6). Men suffer roughly twice the bur-den from road traffic injuries as women. Theyoung and the old are particularly vulnerable, asare drivers of nonmotorized vehicles and pedes-trians. The number of road fatalities and injuries indeveloping countries is rising rapidly with urban-ization and growth in the volume of traffic. Roadfatalities in Africa increased fourfold between 1968and 1988, whereas in Europe they declined bymore than 20 percent during the same period.A multipronged approach to road safety can re-duce crashes at reasonable cost. Public investmentin improved road infrastructure and highway op-eration systems, remedial action at known \"black-spots\" with high accident rates, and expandedpublic transport systems all make a difference.Legislation, financial incentives, and programs ofroad safety education can improve driver behav-ior, reduce traffic speeds, promote use of seatbelts, improve vehicle safety, and reduce drunkdriving. The insurance and legal liability systemsmay also offer powerful incentives for road safety.A carefully designed package of measures such asthose mentioned above can, over time, reduceroad fatalities and injuries by at least one-fifth,thus preventing the loss of at least 6 millionDALYs a year worldwide (Table 4.6). Several coun-tries, including Kenya and Malaysia, have setmore ambitious targets for reductions in deathsand injuries over the next decade.AIDS: a threat to developmentHistorians will look back on the latter half of thiscentury as having had one great medical triumph,the eradication of smallpox, and one great medicaltragedy, AIDS. Unknown prior to 1981, AIDS nowdominates public health programs and health ser-vices in several countries and may come to domi-nate in many more. The human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) that causes AIDS is transmittedthrough sexual intercourse. Like other STDs, it canalso be transmitted by contact with contaminatedblood (notably from transfusions) and frommother to child during the perinatal period. Ca-sual transmission from person to person does notoccur. In developing countries more than 85 per-cent of infections occur through heterosexual in-tercourse. There is no cure, and discovery of avaccine is unlikely before 2000. Action is needednow to combat the spread of the disease. Why AIDS is a special caseAIDS deserves special attention because failure tocontrol the epidemic at an early stage will result infar more damaging and costly consequences in thefuture.The HIV epidemic is bad and is getting worse. Anestimated 9 million people worldwide carried theHIV virus in 1990; as many as 26 million could beinfected by 2000, according to WHO estimates (seeTable 1.3 in Chapter 1). AIDS will then contributeabout 3.3 percent to the global burden of disease,and 1.8 million people will die of AIDS each year.Given the short time it takes infection rates todouble in many developing countries and therapid spread of the disease to countries that previ-ously had low numbers of infections, total figuresin 2000 may be two or three times higher than theabove projections.More than 80 percent of those infected lived indeveloping countries in 1990; by 2000 this will in-crease to an estimated 95 percent. In Thailand onein fifty adults is infected. In Sub-Saharan Africanone in forty adults is already infected, and in cer-tain cities of Africa the prevalence of infection is ashigh as one in three. In some of these high-preva-lence communities AIDS is already starting to re-verse long-term declines in child mortality.Thecost-effectivenessofinterventionsdropssharply when infections cross from high-risk groups tothe general population. Since there is no vaccine orcure for AIDS, primary prevention is the only wayto fight the disease. In the absence of adequatepreventive action, AIDS spreads rapidly in the\"core\" groups (such as sex workers and their cli-ents), followed by a slower and then accelerating 99Early intervention against AIDS prevents spread ofthe disease to the general population. Figure 4.7 Simulated AIDS epidemicin a Sub-Saharan African country AIDS cases per 1,000sexually active population100 100spread in the general population (Figure 4.7).Early and effective targeting of HIV interventionsis critical because these interventions diminish incost-effectiveness as the infection moves out of thehigh-risk,high-transmission core groups. Thelarge number of new sexual contacts in the coregroups means that each HIV case avoided in thisgroup can avert more than ten times as many addi-tional infections as can a case avoided in the gen- eral population.AIDS has catastrophically costly consequences.AIDS, affecting as it does mainly people in theeconomically productive adult years, has powerfulnegative economic effects on households, produc-tive enterprises, and countries (see Box 1.2 inChapter 1). Because so many of its victims areheads of households or parents, AIDS devastatesfamilies. Heavily infected countries have foundtheir health systems burdened with costly cases ofAIDS-related opportunistic infections. If the AIDSepidemic continues unchecked, the accelerated de-mand for health care for AIDS patients will crowdout the needs of other patients. Furthermore, thenumber of tuberculosis cases is increasing dramati-cally as a direct result of HIV, and the presence ofHIV worsens problems with other sexually trans- mitted diseases. (STDs both facilitate HIV trans- mission and are harder to treat in HIV-infectedindividuals.)Prevention of AIDS involves sensitive and politi-cally charged issues. Preventing HIV infection oftennecessitates working with socially marginalizedgroups (including, in many cultures, homosex-uals), and with people whopursue illegal activitiessuch as drug use or prostitution. In addition, aneffective preventive program must reach out to in-form young people frankly about sexual practicesand risks. These activities offer little political bene-fit and may be highly controversial. Strong gov-ernment will and commitment are therefore essen-tial to effective programs, the more so because theseven-to-ten-year lag between HIV infection andthe development of AIDS makes it tempting forcountries and individuals to put off dealing withAIDS issues until it is too late to avert a wide- spread epidemic. Prevention: an absolute necessityA combination of strategies, backed up with ade-quate resources,is required for stemming thespread of AIDS. Crucial elements in these strate-gies are providing information on how to avoidinfection, promoting condom use, treating othersexually transmitted diseases, and reducing blood-borne transmission. These measures are especiallycost-effective when targeted at the relatively fewpeople in the core groups. Unless effective preven-tive action is taken, the number of new HIV infec-tions can be expected to grow, especially in partsof Asia. But a comprehensive AIDS preventionprogram could check the growth of the disease(Figure 4.8).Current annual worldwide expenditure onAIDS prevention is about $1.5 billion a year. Per-haps less than $200 million of this is spent in devel-oping countries, where 85 percent of all infectionsoccur. Among developing countries Thailandspends the most for AIDS prevention, with 1992spending of $45 million, more than 75 percent ofwhich was from government funds. Total AIDSspending on prevention in all Sub-Saharan Africawas only twice this amount, with a mere 10 per-cent from government funds. A recent study forWHO's Global Program on AIDS suggested that80 60A 40+-.-Spreadgeneralintopopulation 20 0Spreadgroupscorethrough 020406080100Time from start of epidemic(years)Source: Adapted from Potts, Anderson, and Boily 1991.comprehensive AIDS and STD prevention servicesfor all developing countries would cost $1.5 billionto $2.9 billion a year. This is ten to fifteen timescurrent spending, but it would yield enormousbenefits. The estimated number of new adult HIVinfections averted by such spending between 1993and 2000 would be about 9.5 million-4.2 millionin Africa, 4.2 million in Asia, and 1.1 million inLatin America.Groups to be targetedPreventive efforts must reach populations with di-verse needs: people at particularly high risk of ac-quiring and transmitting HIV infection (coregroups), young people, and women. Preventiveprograms for the population at large are less cost-effective than targeted programs but are needed toincrease awareness and understanding of AIDSand STDs, reduce discrimination against infectedpersons, and prepare the way for subsequent in-terventions when levels of infection rise. Monog-amy might be encouraged as part of public infor-mation efforts to curb the spread of HIV, but itcannot be the only strategy; even where it is thesocietal norm, not all individuals adhere.High-risk groups may include sex workers, mi-grants, members of the military, truck drivers, anddrug users who share needles. For these groups,preventionofsexualtransmissionessentiallymeans education on safer sex, promotion of con-dom use, and prevention and treatment of STDs.It is important not simply to provide informationon condoms but also to ensure their availabilityand to empower members of the core group, espe-cially female sex workers, to use them. Brothelmanagers and clients must also be persuaded ofthe need to change their behavior; experience fromZaire and other countries shows that promotion ofcondoms to male clients substantially improvesthe success of programs targeted at sex workers.Areas of high STD prevalence warrant aggressiveattempts to control STDs through condom promo-tion, case management and counseling, notifica-tion of partners, and surveillance. These can beprovided through a wide spectrum of health insti-tutions such as family planning clinics and pri-mary health centers.Young people, both in and out of school, needcomprehensive education on reproduction and re-productive health issues. To be most effective, ed-ucation must begin before the onset of sexual ac-tivity (ages 12-14 in many countries) and must betargeted at boys as well as girls. Reaching boys isEffective prevention can markedly slow the rate ofnew infection with HIV Figure 4.8 Trends in new HIV infectionsunder alternative assumptions, 1990-2000:Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Note: Asia includes China, India, and Other Asia andislands.Source: World Health Organization and World Bank data. particularly important because men so often domi-nate the sexual relationship. The curriculumshould be sensitive to local cultural conditions butshould provide explicit, honest explanations ofsexuality, gender issues,safe sexual practices,STDs and HIV, safe motherhood, and family plan-ning. All potential behavioral choices, including 101Sub-Saharan AfricaNew infections per year (millions)3 case 0Optimistic case 199019952001) AsiaNew infections per year (millions)4Worstd 2 I 199019952000abstinence and condom use, should be presented.There is no evidence to support the objection thatproviding sex education encourages promiscuity.In societies in which it is unacceptable for teachersto provide sex education, the task can be delegatedto qualified voluntary groups.Women are biologically more susceptible to ac-quiring HIV infection through heterosexual inter-course than are men, and social factors often addto the risks. In Uganda, for example, more than 60percent of infected persons are women. Preventiveefforts addressed to women, especially those ofchildbearing age, can protect both maternal andchild health. In many African countries AIDS andHIV-related illnesses are already among the topten causes of childhood mortality. At present thereis no way to prevent HIV transmission from aninfected woman to her fetus; about 30 percent ofthe babies of infected women are born with theinfection. Most such babies survive their first year but succumb to opportunistic infections duringtheir second or third year. The uninfected childrenof infected mothers are also at increased risk ofdying because they are likely to lose one or both oftheir parents. The only strategy for fighting child-hood AIDS isto target preventive efforts towomen of childbearing age.Babies can contract HIV through breast milk,creating difficult tradeoffs between the risk of in-fection and the benefits of breastfeeding for childhealth. Recent studies suggest that the risk is sub-stantial (about 30 percent) for babies breastfed bymothers who develop an HIV infection after child-birth; the risk for babies of women who are infec-ted prenatally is smaller, although still significant.Randomized controlled studies are under way inHaiti, Kenya, and Rwanda to determine the risksmore accurately. In the meantime, in areas wherethe primary causes of infant deaths are infectiousdiseases and malnutrition, breastfeeding shouldprobably continue to be recommended. In areas where a safe alternative to breastfeeding exists,testing of pregnant women would provide an op-portunity to advise those infected about the healthrisk of breastfeeding for their babies. Specific preventive interventionsWidespread experience with national AIDS con-trol programs in industrial and developing coun- tries is already on hand. It suggests some areas inwhich action needs to be taken and provides im-portant lessons for programs to control AIDS. 102PROVIDINGINFORMATION. Informingpeopleabout the steps they can take to protect themselvesagainst HIV infection is central to any strategy forcombating AIDS. Individuals need to know thatthe risk of infection can be minimized by reducingthe number of new sexual partners they have, bychoosing partners of lowest risk, by avoiding con- tact with contaminated blood, by using condomsand refraining from risky sexual practices such asanal sex, and by avoiding or seeking treatment forcofactors such as STDs. Intravenous drug users can lower their risks by using clean needles. Incommunities where the HIV virus is present, peo- ple should be aware that unprotected sex is safeonly with a person known unequivocally to be un-infectedfor example, someone who has not yetbeen sexually active and has no other risk factors(such as intravenous drug use or transfusion) orwho has recently undergone HIV testing and hasbeen found to be uninfected. ENCOURAGING CONDOM USE. Condom use is ef-fective in slowing the spread of both HIV andSTDs and needs to be encouraged in all risky sex-ual encounters. Programs to promote condom use in highly vulnerable groups such as clients of sexworkers are cost-effective. One such program tar-geted to low-income sex workers in Nairobi re- duced the mean annual incidence of gonorrheafrom 2.8 episodes per woman in 1986 to 0.7 epi-sode in 1989. The program averted an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 new HIV infections a year at anapproximate cost of $0.50 per DALY gained. Com-munity-wide interventions are also being triedwith success. In Zimbabwe a community interven-tion estimated to cost $85,000 successfully reachedmore than 1 million persons, distributed morethan 5.7 million condoms, and reduced STDs inthe general population by 6 to 50 percent in differ-ent areas. The intervention also changed behavioramong sex workers: the proportion reporting con-dom use with their last client rose to 72 percent,from only 18 percent before the intervention.Social marketing is another strategy for promot- ing condom use. In Zaire distribution outletsfrom pharmacies to traditional healers and fromnightclubs to street vendorswere saturated withcondoms. Condom sales rose from 20,000 in 1987to 18.3 million in 1991. Consumer research indi-cates that 90 percent of the condoms were boughtby men and that about 60 percent were intendedfor casual sex. Estimates suggest that the programaverted about 25,000 HIV infections in 1991 alone.REDUCING BLOOD-BORNE TRANSMISSION. Bloodtransfusions account for less than 5 percent of HIVtransmission worldwide, but transfusion with in-fected blood almost always leads to infection. Mea-sures for preventing transmission of HIV throughblood transfusions include reducing the need fortransfusions, eliminating payments for donatedblood (because paid donors tend to have a higherrisk of HIV), and screening donors. Effective earlytreatment of health problems, combined with edu-cation for health care providers about the properindications for transfusion, can cut the need fortransfusions by more than 50 percent. Publichealth programs such as helminth control inschools, iron supplementation, prenatal care, andmalaria control can reduce the severity of existinganemia and thus diminish the need for transfu-sions. When transfusion is unavoidable, blood do-nors can be screened to ensure a supply of unin-fected blood. The cost-effectiveness of bloodscreening varies dramatically depending on theprevalence of HIV. To maintain the population'soverall confidence in the medical community,however, blood screening has been advocatedeven where HIV prevalence is low. When bloodbanks exist, screening adds only about 5 percent tothe total cost of each unit of transfused blood. INTEGRATING AIDS PREVENTION AND STD SER-VICES. Wide availability of STD services is crucialfor fighting AIDS because HIV transmission is fa-cilitated by the genital lesions and inflammationassociated with STDs. Treatment of STDs is oftenhighly cost-effective in its own right. It becomeseven more cost-effective when the benefits of re-duced HIV transmission are added. Curing eachcase of gonorrhea in a core group saves 120DALYs, at a cost well below $1 per DALY gained ifthe benefits of fewer secondary cases and reducedrisk of HIV transmission are included.Because many STDs are asymptomatic (espe-cially in women), infected individuals may havelittle motivation to be tested and treated. Even forthose with symptoms, charges for clinical servicesmay reduce access to treatment and therefore in-crease the spread of STDs. In Nairobi, for exam-ple, the introduction of fees at the main STD clinicreduced attendance by 60 percent among men and35 percent among women. Subsidizing STD ser-vices therefore makes sense as part of an AIDScontrol program. Another good strategy is to com-bine STD and family planning services; screeningfor asymptomatic STD infections in family plan-ning clinics has revealed infection rates as high as20 percent. TESTING AND SCREENING. Voluntary HIV testingprovidesindividualswith useful informationabout themselves and their partners. Studies sug-gest that counseling and testing can help individ-uals and couples adopt safer sexual behavior. Theonce-prohibitive cost of testing has been decliningsharply; a couple can now be screened for lessthan $2 (excluding the cost of counseling). Thetest, however, is not always reliable because thereis a short period during which HIV may not bedetected in a newly infected person; furthermore,a negative test result is no guarantee of continuingrisk-free behavior. As a result, testing is currentlymost useful for couples within or planning a long-term relationship. Governments need to ensurethat testing remains voluntary and anonymous,meets quality standards, and is accompanied byappropriate counseling or information.SURVEILLANCE. Public health surveillance forHIV is critical in areas where extensive spread ofthe virus has not yet occurred. Countries that es-tablish a timely and reliable system of surveillanceare able to give policymakers early warning of animpending spread of the virus. Useful activitiesinclude regular surveillance for HIV and syphilisin a few prenatal clinics and in centers serving cli-ents at high risk of infection, such as sex workersand patients with STDs.Several of the preventive interventions dis-cussed above have been incorporated in the Indiangovernment's National AIDS Control Project,launched in 1992 with the assistance of the WorldBank and WHO. The Indian program emphasizespromoting public awareness about AIDS, promot-ing health in core groups through NGOs, control-ling STDs, improving the safety of blood supplies,strengthening surveillance and institutional capa-bilities for control of HIV-AIDS, and encouragingthe humane treatment of people with AIDS or HIVinfections. Care of AIDS patientsIn 1992 developing countries spent about $340 mil-lion to care for AIDS patients. Although this isonly a small fraction of the $4.7 billion spent byindustrial countries to care for their AIDS patients,it is still nearly twice the amount spent on AIDSprevention in the developing world. If spending 103per patient remains constant, the amount spent onthe care of AIDS patients in developing countrieswill more than triple, to $1.1 billion in 2000. Todate, many AIDS control programs have not de-veloped guidelines for the cost-effective provisionof care for AIDS patients. Antiviral drugs such asazidothymidine (AZT) are enormously expensive,have severe side effects, and may, at best, delaythe onset of AIDS and prolong life to some extent.One year of AZT costs more than $3,000, a prohib-itively high figure. Treatment options in manylow-income nations are therefore limited to allevia-tion of pain and management of the opportunisticinfectionsmost commonly, tuberculosis, diar-rhea, and candidiasisthat afflict HIV-infectedpersons. Strategic planning can greatly reducecosts through the use of a small number of less-expensive drugs and outpatient or communitytreatment where possible. Basic care, includingoutpatient treatment of opportunistic infections,can cost $200 to $400 per DALY gained, a substan-tial sum. Palliative home care, by contrast, costsbetween $30 and $75 per DALY gained, but it maybe a substantial burden to the family. Uganda'sinnovative activities have made it possible to pro-vide caring responses, at modest cost, to those af-flicted (Box 4.9).The need for national and international actionAt present, most national AIDS programs are in-adequate, despite international attention and thesignificant effort by WHO to help design and im-plement plans for controlling AIDS. Most pro-grams use only the resources available to minis-tries of health, are too standardized, and neglectthe control of STDs. AIDS has to be approached asa national development issue. National leadershipis crucial; the most effective programs, such asThailand's, pursue strategies that involve manyagencies, in and outside government, in an atmo-sphere of openness and frankness (Box 4.10). Box 4.9Coping with AIDS in UgandaBy June 1992 Uganda had reported 33,971 AIDS cases;the true number may be between 100,000 and 300,000,and it is estimated that I million to 1.5 million Ugan-dans are infected with HIV. In Kampala more than 30percent of all pregnant women are infected, and inmany parts of the country AIDS is the most commoncause of admission and death among hospitalizedadults. With this immense burden, care of infected in-dividuals and management of the social consequencesof infection are perceived to be as important as preven-tion of further cases of HIV.In response, a variety of innovative activities havebeen undertaken. In 1987 the first AIDS clinic wasopened, with a small staff, a few drugs, and little out-side support. The clinic recently enrolled its 8,000thpatient. Patients regard the care they get there as muchhigher in quality than that available elsewhere. Thefounder of the clinic, Dr. Ely Katabira, and anotherphysician at the national teaching hospital have pro-duced a 104-page manual on AIDS care that recom-mends simple diagnostic and treatment strategies forAIDS; for example, nine relatively inexpensive drugsused in combination with tuberculosis therapy canachieve a high degree of relief for patients with AIDS.Also in 1987 sixteen Ugandans who were personallyaffected by AIDS (because of their own infection or thatof a family member) set up a new voluntary organiza-tion, The AIDS Support Organization (TASO), to pro-vide emotional support for AIDS sufferers. Twelve ofthe founding members have since died of AIDS, butTASO has grown to include ninety-seven counselors,three supervisors, and six trainers in eight locations.Services, which reach more than 30,000 people a year,include counseling, condom education and distribu-tion, home care, income-generating activities, feedingprograms, and payment of orphans' school fees.In 1990, to address the demand for personal testing,Uganda's first anonymous HIV testing and counselingcenter was established. The enormous demand hasmade individual pretest counseling impossible, butgroup counseling has become popular. Individual post-test counseling continues to be offered, and HIV-posi-tive patients are referred to TASO for further support.AIDS awareness in Uganda is so high that many peo-ple assume they are infected. Couples who are testedand found to be negative report they are more moti-vated to be monogamous, and a small follow-up studyfound that such clients have fewer casual sex partnersand use condoms regularly. Additional centers havebeen established in other areas, as well as an executivetesting center for businessmen and parliamentariansuncomfortable about being served in the busy publicclinic. High demand indicates that Ugandans want toknow whether they are infected, particularly beforeembarking on important life events such as marriage.Uganda's experience demonstrates that an AIDS-test-ing program in a country with a high prevalence ofheterosexual transmission can have a more positive in-fluence on behavior than results from the industrialworld would indicate. 104Box 4.10HIV in Thailand: from disaster toward containmentAs late as 1988 Thailand and the test of Asia were con-sidered to be relatively free of HIV infection, leadingsenior Thai health experts to conjecture that Asiansmight be less susceptible to the disease. That year,however, an explosive HIV epidemic started its marchthrough Thailand, affecting all levels of society. Todayit is estimated that 2 percent of sexually active adults,or 400,000 to 600,000 people, are infected. Without ef-fective prevention, by 2000 the number infected may beas high as 2 million to 4 million.Faced with the HIV epidemic, Thai officials havemoved quickly from complacency to action. Thailand,they realized, could not sustain its 10 percent annualgrowth of GNP in the presence of a huge AIDS epi-demic. Indeed, in 1991 researchers projected that theaggregate direct and indirect cost of AIDS could be ashigh as $8 billion over the next decade and that AIDScould have negative effects on tourism, foreign invest-ment, and labor remittances from abroad. They ar-gued, however, that a major preventive effort, with thegoals of reducing numbers of sexual partners by at leastone-half, doubling condom use, and treating STDs,could mean 3.5 million fewer infections and more than$5 billion in savings by 2000.AIDS prevention is now being accorded the highestpriority in Thailand, and a national AIDS preventionand control committee chaired by the prime ministerhas been formed. In 1992 the cabinet approved the es-tablishment of the AIDS Policy and Planning Coor-dination Bureau in the office of the permanent secre-tary of the prime minister. The multisectoral bureaucoordinates the planning and budgeting of AIDS activ-ities among fourteen ministries, international fundingagencies, and local sources of support. The bureau alsofacilitates the planning of joint activities with privatebusinesses and NGOs.Thailand's strategy has led to a broad consensuswithin the country on the importance of taking action.Spending for AIDS prevention was $28 million in 1991and $45 million in 1992. To monitor the epidemic, Thai-land has established the world's most comprehensivenational HIV surveillance system, which reports twicea year on HIV prevalence in all risk groups in all pro-vinces of the country. Acknowledging that commercialsex is ingrained in Thai society and will remain so inthe short run, the government has decided to mandateand enforce a policy of 100 percent condom use at thebrothels. This ensures that brothels cannot compete forcustomers seeking condom-free sex. Preliminary evi-dence shows very high rates of condom use, with de-mand increasing from 10 million a year to about 120million a year and reductions in the incidence of STDs.The prime minister's office is launching nationalcampaigns through the mass media in 1993-94 to pro-mote changes in the sexual culture and the sexualnorms of the population. Only time will determinewhether intervention has been prompt and effectiveenough to halt the further spread of HIV No single strategy in the fight against AIDS willmeet the needs of every country. Three main crite-ria can guide the choice of priorities from the rangeof HIV-AIDS interventions listed above. These cri-teria are current HIV prevalence, risk of futurespread, and existing AIDS burden. Strategies fordifferent countries and regions within countriesfall into four main groups.Areas with little HIV and few STDs (for ex-ample, rural areas of northern China and NorthAfrica) should emphasize comprehensive repro-ductive health education for youth, with some at-tention to AIDS prevention among high-riskgroups, and should establish a sensitive HIV sur-veillance system.Areas at high risk of an epidemic from earlyspread of HIV or having a high rate of STDs (forexample, Yunnan Province in China and Sura-baya, Indonesia) should undertake massive, tar-geted preventive activities for high-risk groups, in-cluding sex workers, supplemented by generaleducation and by testing of the blood supply.Areas with an HIV epidemic but as yet littledisease (for example, Thailand, and urban areas ofIndia) need to develop AIDS prevention programsfor the entire population while continuing to targethigh-risk groups. Voluntary HIV testing and coun-seling and preparation for the care of AIDS pa-tients should also begin.Finally, areas with a major epidemic and ahigh disease burden (for example, Uganda andZambia) have to combine a broadly based preven-tive strategy with attention to care for AIDS pa-tients (see Box 4.9).Nongovernmental organizations can play a vitalrole in prevention, care, and community supportprograms, using their credibility and access toreach those at highest risk, such as intravenousdrug users and sex workers. Such groups havebeen highly effective in using social marketing toreach individuals at the grass-roots level, particu-larly by initiating peer education and media pro-grams that reinforce behavior change and work tomodify the perceived social norms. A recent 105Table 4.7 Costs and health benefits of public health packages in low- and middle-income countries, 1990 needs-assessment study conducted in a number ofdeveloping countries showed that the full poten-tial of NGOs was not being realized for lack offinancial, managerial, and technical support. Plan-ning is under way for a program to provide inno-vative mechanisms for simple and flexible assis-tance to nongovernmental groups working onAIDS.The world must do more to deal with the globalchallenge of AIDS. No country is immune from afuture HIV epidemic, and the costs of delay arehigh. A global coalition is needed that will encour-age and assist governments to take bold action be-fore it is too late. Without a substantial increase inpolitical commitment and leadership-as well asadditional resources to support the $1.5 billion to$2.9 billion needed annually for effective preven-tion of AIDS-the HIV epidemic could cause a health disaster and an enormous setback fordevelopment.The essential public health packagePublic health programs that address the problemsdescribed above can produce substantial health 106Note: Numbers in parentheses refer to per capita cost as a percentage of income per capita.Although costs are estimated for 100 percent coverage, the health benefits are based on 95 percent coverage for EN Plus and 80 percent coverage for the school health, AIDS prevention, and tobacco and alcohol programs.Includes information, communication, and education on selected risk factors and health behaviors, plus vector control and disease surveil- lance and monitoring.The health benefits from information and communication and from disease surveillance are counted in the other public and clinical services in the health package. The health benefits from vector control are unknown.Calculation of the potential disease burden averted through this program assumes no change in the prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption; if such prevalence were to rise, the potential benefits would be larger.Exiudes treatment of STDs, which are in the clinical services package; see Table 5.3.Source: Authors' calculations. gains at modest cost. Local conditions vary, but anessential public health package is likely to include:The Expanded Programme on Immunization,including micronutrient supplementationSchool health programs to treat worm infec-tions and micronutrient deficiencies and to pro- vide health educationPrograms to increase public knowledge aboutfamily planning and nutrition, about self-cure orindications for seeking care, and about vector con-trol and disease surveillance activitiesPrograms to reduce consumption of tobacco,alcohol, and other drugsAIDS prevention programs with a strong STDcomponent.This public health package would yield large bene-fits at low cost (Table 4.7). In low-income countriesit would avert more than 8 percent of the burdenof disease at a cost of just $4 per capita (1.2 percentof income per capita), while in middle-incomecountries it might avert 4 percent of the burden ofdisease at a cost of $7 per capita (0.3 percent ofincome per capita).

Information should cover thebenefits of healthy eating, contraceptive use, andhygienic practices in the household; the health ef-fects of smoking and of alcohol and drug abuse;and prevention of HIV infections. Some publichealth measures will involve providing services inclinics, including family planning and STD-relatedservices. These are included in the essential pack-age of clinical measures discussed in the nextchapter. Health will also be served if governmentsdo less in a number of areasif they avoid inter-vening in food markets, cut indiscriminate sub-sidies for water and sanitation, remove most re-strictions on contraceptive services, and abolishsubsidies on fuels. Appropriate government regu-latory action on the ambient environment, occupa-tional conditions, and road safety can also safe-guard people's health. 107Clinical services This chapter analyzes the roles of the public andprivate sectors in paying for and delivering clinicalservices. It examines in depth an important con-clusion of Chapter 3: that governments have a fun-damental responsibility for ensuring universal ac-cess to an essential package of clinical services,with special attention to reaching the poor (Table5.1). The choice of services to be included in such apackage for each country will be strongly influ-enced by information on the distribution of dis-ease and the relative cost-effectiveness of clinicalinterventions. A minimum package of clinical ser-vices could reduce the present burden of diseaseby about one-quarter in low-income countries andby about one-tenth in middle-income countries.This package is affordablebut only if govern-ments carry out significant health-financing re-forms that will affect the allocation of public fundsand the roles of insurance and of user charges.Only by reducing or eliminating spending onclinical services that are outside the nationally de-fined essential package can governments concen-trate on ensuring essential clinical care for thepoor. Two key ways to reallocate governmentspending are to increase cost recovery, especiallyby charging the wealthy for services in govern-ment hospitals, and to promote unsubsidized in-surance for middle- and upper-income groups.Governments can avoid the explosive increases inhealth expenditures that many countries are nowconfronting by encouraging competition amongproviders and prepayment for care, generatingand disseminating information on providers' costsand insurers' products, and, in some cases, settinglimitsoncompensationofphysiciansandhospitals. 108Although both the public and the private sectorshave important roles in the delivery of clinical ser-vices, government-run health systems in many de-veloping countries are overextended and need tobe scaled back. This can be done through legal andadministrative changes designed to facilitate pri-vate (NGO and for-profit) involvement in provi-sion of health services, by public subsidies toNGOs for supplying the essential package, and bycurtailment of new investments in public tertiaryhospitals. At the same time, the efficiency of pub-lic sector health services can be greatly enhancedthrough decentralization and improved manage-ment of government hospitals and programs.Public and private finance of clinical servicesAround the world, clinical services are financedthrough four main channels. Twoout-of-pocketpayments and voluntary insuranceare private.The other two are public: compulsory insurance(sometimes known as social insurance) that iseither publicly managed or heavily regulated bygovernments, and funding from general govern-ment revenues.In the poorest countries total health expendituremay be as low as $2 per person a year, and morethan half of this comes from private sources,mainly in the form of out-of-pocket payments. In-surance mechanisms in those countries are weak,and the amount of government revenues devotedto health is low. As incomes increase, so do boththe percentage of income spent on health (asshown in the upper panel of Figure 5.1) and theshare of health spending that comes from publicsources (illustrated in the lower panel). In the for-Table 5.1 Rationales and directions for government action in the finance and delivery of clinicalservices AreaEssential clinical services Clinical services outside theessential packageConditions that may call forgovernment action: market failureand povertyFailure for example,tuberculosis for the generalpopulation.

All national health systems use atleast two of the twelve possible combinations offinancing method and health service organization,and sometimes the different combinations servesharply differentiated populations. Even so, it ispossible to group countries according to incomelevel and the predominant system of providinghealth care. A principal distinction is whether in-Directions for government actionFinance essential clinical services by reallocating currentgovernment spending. In low-income countries this maymean increasing public expenditures for health.Require through legislation that social insurance ormandated private insurance cover an essential package.Encourage more private and NGO provision of essentialservices, through appropriate legislation and targetedpublic subsidies. Reduce or eliminate subsidization of clinical services outsidethe essential package. Subsidies for public provision ofservices at less than cost and tax relief for employer andemployee health insurance payments often cover serviceswith low cost-effectiveness and primarily benefit thewealthy.Legislate compulsory social insurance or mandated privateinsurance, or define the national essential packagecomprehensively.Limit government involvement in delivery of nonessentialservices and encourage competition in service delivery bygovernment, NGOs, and the private sector.Regulate private insurance by, for example, requiringcommunity risk-rating and forbidding the rejection ofhigh-risk consumers.Define the exact content of prepaid packages of care to serveas the products bought and sold in the insurance market.Encourage the use of prepayment or salary-basedapproaches to provider compensation.Foster improvements in the quality of private provision byencouraging self-regulation of hospitals, medical schools,and physicians and by disseminating performanceindicators. surance pays for much care and, if so, what is thedominant type of insurance (Table 5.2).In low-income countries private out-of-pocket pay-ments account for more than half of the mere $2 to$40 per person spent each year for health care.Most of this sum goes for doctors' fees, paymentsto traditional healers, and drugs. NGOs, particu-larly those related to religious institutions, makeimportant contributions to the provision of healthservices in many low-income countries. In Tan-zania and Haiti NGOs operate nearly half of thehospitals, and in Cameroon and Uganda theymanage 40 percent of health facilities. In Ghanaand Nigeria about a third of all hospital beds arelocated in mission hospitals. Government spend- 109As countries get richer, the i spend more of their income on health, and the public share grows larger.

There is little or noinsurance.Until recently, China was an important excep-tion among low-income countries. There, between1960 and 1980, state enterprises provided healthcare directly to their workers or contracted withgovernment hospitals to do so. Rural communeswere required to earmark a portion of their finan-cial resources for health services for all their mem-bers. By the late 1970s insurance covered virtuallyall the urban population and 85 percent of the ruralpopulationa unique achievement for a low-income developing country. Since the eliminationof communal agriculture and the liberalization ofindustry in the early 1980s, however, these formsof health insurance and service delivery haveBangladesh, India,Pakistan, mostSub-SaharanAfricancountries Costa considerably. rural population in-creasingly relies on a system of government-provided health care financed in part out of gen-eral revenues, but with substantial cost recoverythrough user charges, not unlike systems prevail-ing in other low-income countries.In the middle-income countries there are two majortypes of health systems, distinguished by whetherthe government or the private sector provideshealth insurance. Health spending, at $20 to $400per capita, is higher than in low-income countries,and both public and private managerial capacity isstronger. In countries with private insurance, suchas South Africa and Zimbabwe, the governmentuses general revenues to pay for health care formiddle- and low-income groups, while upper-income households (less than 20 percent of thepopulation) use private insurance to pay for pri- 111As shareDollarsCountry group and 1990 per of GNPper Maincapita income (dollars) (percent)capita characteristics Examplesvate physicians and hospitals or for private roomsin government hospitals.In countries with social insurance, mandatorycontributions from employees and employers, andsometimes government funds, finance insurancefor part of the population, including most middle-class workers. Health care for the poor is financedfrom general revenues. This is the system that pre-vails in Korea, Turkey, and most of Latin America.In the formerly socialist economies of Eastern Eu-rope and the Soviet Union, general revenuefinancing with government provision of healthservices was until recently the only officially recog-nized form of health care. Public spending onhealth now accounts for 3 to 6 percent of GNP inthese countries, or $30 to $200 per capita. Prior tothe period of political and economic liberalizationin the late 1980s, private payments were fre-quently made for \"public\" health services (for ex-ample, gratuities were given physicians in govern-ment hospitals), and drugs often leaked from thepublic sector into private markets. Since the politi-cal and economic reforms that swept across thesecountries in the late 1980s, the health systemsthere have been in crisis. Dwindling public fund-ing and deteriorating government services havecreated strong pressures for new forms of publicand private insurance.The established market economies, with the excep-tion of the United States, rely on one of the twotypes of public financing for more than three-quar-ters of their health expenditures, which rangefrom $400 to $2,500 per person per year. Norway,Sweden, and the United Kingdom use general taxrevenues to pay for health services that are pro-vided directly by the government. In France, Ger-many, and Japan, among others, social insuranceis the dominant mode of financing. The UnitedStates, with annual health spending of about$2,800 per capita, has a bewildering combinationof systems, including voluntary private employ-ment-based insurance, compulsory insurance forfederal workers with each employee having achoice of alternative insurers and packages, andfull public finance and provision for veterans. Asingle-payer approach financed from general reve-nue is used at the federal level for health care forthe elderly (Medicare) and at the state level for thdpoor (Medicaid).Selecting and financing the essential clinicalpackageA basic responsibility accepted by governments al-most everywhere is to ensure access to a package 112of essential clinical services. But what should bethe content of this package? Although politicalconsiderations will inevitably affect the decision,the most important factors in selecting the essen-tial package should be the relative cost-effective-ness of interventions, the size and distribution ofthe health problems affecting the population, andthe resources available. Defining the essential packageA patient's health needs often require several in-terrelated interventions. A child with fever and di-arrhea may require treatment for both acute respi-ratory and gastrointestinal infections. A pregnantwoman needs to receive both prenatal and deliv-ery care. For this reason, it makes sense to groupcertain interventions when analyzing their costsand benefits. Five groups, or clusters, of clinicalinterventions are likely to be important in everycountry's essential clinical package: prenatal anddelivery care; family planning services; manage-ment of the sick child; treatment of tuberculosis;and case management of sexually transmitted dis-eases (STD5). The first two groups are often dis-cussed under the umbrella of \"safe motherhood\"activities, but for the purposes of cost and benefitestimates they are presented separately here. Allfive sets of interventions are highly cost-effective;each costs $50 or less per DALY in low-incomesettings and $150 or less per DALY in middle-income settings. Moreover, they deal with wide-spread health problems that affect the poor.Details on the health problems that these fivegroups of clinical interventions help to resolve, onways of delivering the interventions efficiently topatients, and on the cost-effectiveness of the inter-ventions are given in Boxes 5.1 through 5.4. Theproblems addressed are among the largest afflict-ing developing countries. Four preventable or eas-ily treatable infectious diseases of children accountfor nearly 7 million child deaths annually. Unsafechildbirth is responsible for half a million maternaldeaths each year. Tuberculosis kills more than 2million people annually, making it the leadingcause of death among adults. More than 250 mil-lion new cases of debilitating and potentially fatalSTDs occur each year.In addition to these five groups of clinical inter-ventions, in any realistic setting an essential pack-age would have to include treatment of minorinfection and trauma, as well as advice and allevia-tion of pain for health problems that cannot befully resolved with existing resources and technol-Box 5.1Making pregnancy and delivery safeUnder optimal conditions, about 990 of every 1,000pregnancies that reach the seventh month of gestationconclude with a healthy newborn and a healthymother. For most women in the developing world,however, childbirth is unsafe. About one in 50 womenin developing countries dies as a consequence of com-plications of pregnancy and childbirth, compared withonly one in 2,700 in the established market economies.Maternal mortality has profound consequences withinthe household; the chances of dying for children under5 increase by up to 50 percent when the mother dies.In [987 the international health community, includ-ing the World Bank, WHO, the United Nations Popula-tion Fund (UNPF), and agencies in forty-five countries,launched the Safe Motherhood Initiative. The primegoal is to reduce by half the number of maternal deathsby 2000. The health programs recommended under theinitiative include family planning and pregnancy-related care, prenatal care, and delivery care. (Familyplanning and abortion services are discussed morefully in Chapter 4.) The marginal cost-effectiveness ofpregnancy-related care varies with circumstances, butthe World Bank has estimated that the average cost perDALY is between $30 and $110, the equivalent of lessthan $2,000 per death averted.The extension of prenatal, delivery, and postpartumcare to 80 percent of the world's population would re-duce by 40 percent the burden of disease associatedwith unsafe childbirth, at a cost of between $90 and$255 per birth attended, or $4 to $9 per capita. A rea-sonable program of pregnancy-related care would in-clude three components:Information, education, and communications designedto create demand for clinical services, alert women andothers to danger signs that may occur during preg-nancy and childbirth, and mobilize communities fortransport of women with complications to districthospitalsCommunity-based obstetrics with trained nurse-mid-wife staff to provide prenatal care, including tetanustoxoid immunization, treatment for syphilis, provisionof micronutrients (iron, folate, and iodine), and detec-tion of complications of pregnancy and delivery; nor-mal delivery, application of an-tibiotics firstaid, including sedatives for early eclampsia (preg-nancy-related seizures) and manual removal of the pla-centa; effective early referral of severe complications;and safe abortion.District hospital facilities to provide essential obstet-ric services (cesarean section, anesthesia, blood re-placement, manual procedures, and monitoring of la-bor) and neonatal resuscitation (aspiration of secretionsand assisted respiration with oxygen).The emphasis given the different components willdepend on local conditions. At one extreme are dis-tricts where resources are limited and women arehighly isolated. Here, high priorities would be prenatalcare aimed mainly at correcting micronutrient deficien-cies and infections such as STDs and malaria. At theother extreme are urban and periurban areas wherereferral centers are overwhelmed with normal deliv-eries and the quality of care is typically low; here,health centers should be improved so that they candeal with normal births, and the quality of hospital careshould be enhanced to provide better treatment of ob-stetric complications. ogies. Hospital capacity would be sufficient tohandle some emergency care, including most frac-tures and infrequently needed procedures such asappendectomies. Local discretion in the provisionof these services would depend on the availabilityof inputs and on day-to-day capacity. This \"lim-ited care\" and the five groups of interventions to-gether constitute a minimum package of essential clin-ical services. Efficient delivery of these essentialservices requires a well-functioning district healthsystem consisting of health posts and health cn-ters as the first point of patient contact and districthospitals as referral facilities, with the two levelslinked by emergency transport.Governments must ensure that publicly pro-vided facilities have the necessary inputsdrugs,supplies,facilities,equipment,andproperlytrained staffto deliver essential services and thatinputs for services outside the nationally definedpackage are not supplied. A district hospital withabout one bed per 1,000 population served isneeded to provide inpatient and specialized out-patient care, but the hospital would have to per-form only basic surgery. No higher-level hospitalis required for delivery of the minimum package.Although doctors are needed for supervising es-sential clinical care and handling more compli-cated cases, most of the services in the minimumpackage can be delivered by nurses and midwives.A ratio of fully qualified nurses to physicians ofbetween 2 and 4 to 1 (estimates vary to accommo-date the availability of physicians and nurses indifferent regions) and 0.1 to 0.2 physician per1,000 population would be adequate. Although 113Box 5.2Integrated management of the sick childFour groups of infectious diseasediarrhea! diseases,acute respiratory infections (ARIs), measles, and ma-lanaaccount for more than half of the 12.7 milliondeaths every year of children under age 5. In the devel-oping world measles alone causes 860,000 deaths inchildren under age 5 and accounts for 6 percent ofDALYs lost in that age group. Malaria causes 4 percentof the disease burden in the under-five group. Sickchildren taken by their mothers to health centers fordiarrhea! disease and for ARTs such as pneumonia of-ten receive inappropriate diagnosis and treatment,leading to unnecessary complications and deaths.Whereas preventing diarrhea! diseases and ARIs hasproved difficult and is probably not cost-effective, casemanagement in community-based programs is feasibleand extremely effective. WHO and UNICEF have re-cently begun to support national programs on the Inte-grated Management of the Sick Child. This initiativebuilds on more than fifteen years of experience withcase management of diarrheal diseases, mainly by oralrehydration therapy (ORT), and about seven years ofresearch on and program implementation of case man-agement of ARIs.In Nepal a controlled intervention trial that reliedexclusively on indigenous community health workers(CHWs) to detect and treat pneumonia without hospi-talization led to a 28 percent reduction in the risk ofdeath from all causes by the third year of service. Addi-tional benefits were obtained from the reduction indeaths caused by diarrhea and measles. Other researchon similar community-based strategies for children un-der age 5 indicates decreases of approximately 50 per-cent in infant mortality from ARTs. In Egypt the use ofORT has in some areas led to a reduction of 50 percentin mortality from diarrhea and 40 percent in overallmortality among children ages I month to 5 years. Theexperience with these two disease clusters can be ex-panded to include children with malaria, measles, andmalnutrition. Evidence that malaria and pneumoniaoverlap in their clinical presentation and can be treatedwith the same antibiotic strengthens the case for treat-ing several diseases together.Under the integrated management approach, thesick child is initially assessed by means of a limitedrange of questions and observation of easily recognizedsymptoms. The child's nutritional and immunizationstatus is measured, and immunization is given ifneeded. The child's condition is classified according todisease grouping and severity guidelines, which areused as a basis for treatment and possible referrals. Thefinal step is to give the mother advice Ofl follow-upcare.The core of the package is to train primary healthcare providers to diagnose diseases and prescribe theappropriate treatment at the health center level or referimmediately to a district hospital those cases with com-plications. An adequate supply of antibiotics, anti-malarial drugs, and other drugs is critical for success.The integrated cluster of treatments, including hospitalservices, would cost between $30 and $100 per DALYsaved. Since the walk-in component accounts for ap-proximately 60 to 70 percent of the reduction in thedisease burden, district hospitals are not indispensablefor starting the program, but their presence and properfunctioning add substantial health benefits. If highrates of health service use can be achieved, child deathsin high-mortality communities, according to WHO esti-mates, could be reduced by between 50 and 70 percent.This fact and the relatively low technology involvedmake the management of the sick child a high priorityin countries with child mortality rates of more thanthirty deaths per 1,000 children under age 5. many developing countries can already deliver theminimum package, some low-income nationswould require additional investments in person-nel, equipment, and facilities.In developing countries with the financial re-sources and political will to go beyond the mini-mum clinical package, a more comprehensive setof services could cover other interventions withslightly lower cost-effectiveness than those in theminimum package. This set might include a num-ber of interventions for chronic disease, such asuse of oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control dia-betes, medical treatment for schizophrenia andmanic-depressive illness, screening and treatmentfor breast and cervical cancer, measures (for exam-ple, use of aspirin and of simple antihypertensive 114drugs) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseasein high-risk individuals, and inexpensive manage-ment of angina and heart attacks. Other treat-ments that might fit into an expanded package in-clude hernia repair,meningitis treatment forchildren, management of gastrointestinal ulcers,cataract removal, and treatment of moderately se-vere injuries and of complications of diabetes.Given the large contribution of disability to theburden of disease, inclusion of low-cost rehabilita-tive measures will often be a priority for interven-tions beyond the minimum essential package.These interventionsmost of which respond toconditions that will become increasingly commonwith the epidemiological transition documented inChapter 1can cost as little as $200 to $300 perDALY. Including them and other interventions ofsimilar cost-effectiveness would reduce the currentdisease burden by 5 to 10 percent.Many health procedures have such low cost-effectiveness that governments should excludethem from the essential clinical package. In low-income countries these might include heart sur-gery; treatment (other than pain relief) of highlyfatal cancers of the lung, liver, and stomach; ex-pensive drug therapies for HIV infection; and in-tensive care for severely premature babies. It isdifficult to justify using government funds forthese medical treatments when much more cost-effective services that benefit mainly the poor arenot receiving adequate financing.Several developing countries that have beenhighly successful at improving the health status oftheir populations have emphasized access to anessential package of services in their allocation ofpublic spending on health. In Botswana and Zim-babwe the rapid decline in infant mortality andrise in life expectancy during the 1980s werestrongly influenced by government action to ex-pand the health infrastructure and by the use ofgeneral tax revenues to finance an array of publichealth and clinical services. Some key services thatwere initially left out of the package but are nowbeing incorporated include vitamin A supplemen-tation and improved control of STDs. Similarly,dramatic health gains in Costa Rica in the 1970swere largely brought about by new basic publichealth and clinical services, financed almost en-tirely by the Ministry of Health and the nationalsocial security agency. The remarkable improve-ments in health status in China, Kerala State inIndia, and Sri Lanka are attributable in part to gov- Box 5.3Treatment of sexually transmitted diseasesSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are extremelycommon infections: according to a 1990 estimate byWHO, there are more than 250 million new cases eachyear worldwide. These diseases have severe and oftenirreversible consequences that disproportionately af-fect women, who bear 80 percent of the total DALYslost to STDs (excluding HIV). Women are more likelythan men to acquire STDs because of the greater effi-ciency of male-to-female transmission for most STDpathogens, the lack of female-controlled preventivemethods, and, in many settings, gender power dy-namics that limit women's ability to determine the con-ditions under which sexual intercourse occurs. Womenare less likely than men to obtain care for STDs becausethe majority of infected women are asymptomatic andthose with symptoms may be deterred by fear of socialstigma. Since STDs also inflict a heavy burden of ill-ness on men, and since men are responsible for muchSTD transmission, disease control measures, to be ef-fective, must be targeted to both sexes.Because STDs increase the efficacy of transmission ofHIV, controlling these infections is one of the most im-portant interventions for containing the spread ofAIDS. But even in the absence of AIDS, STDs causesubstantial morbidity and mortality. They usually af-fect people in the 15-44 age group, the most economi-cally productive ages. One of the main causes of .neo-natal morbidity and mortality in some countries iscongenital syphilis. Because treatment is simple (one tothree injections of penicillin) and inexpensive, screen-ing and treatment for syphilis during prenatal care hasbeen recommended for the minimum package. De-pending on the prevalence of disease, on whether theperson affected is a member of a \"core\" group andhence likely to transmit syphilis to others, and Ofl thecase-detection strategy used, curing a case of syphiliscan cost as little as $0.10 or as much as $40 per DALY. InZambia a syphilis treatment demonstration project forpregnant women achieved a two-thirds reduction instillbirths, low birth weights, and neonatal deaths as-sociatedwithsyphilis,eventhoughattendance,screening, and treatment were not optimal. The costwas $12 per adverse outcome prevented, or less than$1 per DALY. In a similar program in Kenya preventionof one neonatal death cost $50. Unfortunately, in mostcountries a comprehensive program of perinatal syph-ilis screening has not been implemented.Effective interventions exist for other STDs, but lackof simple, appropriate, rapid, and inexpensive diag-nostics for use in the field have made these measuresmuch more difficult and expensive to implement. Con-sequently, when resources are limited, such interven-tions must be targeted specifically to core groups to becost-effective. In these groups, case management ofchlamydia (a bacterial infection of the reproductivetract) and gonorrhea can be highly cost-effective ($10 to$40 per DALY), as can treatment of chancroid in areaswhere it is common. Much of the cost of interventionfor these diseases is related to diagnosis. Calculationssuggest that if prevalence of an STD is more than 10percent, treating everyone in the risk group may bemore cost-effective than screening. This, however,does not take into account the problems of widespreaduse of the antibiotics used to treat STDs, including ad-verse reactions, development of microbial resistance,and 5.4Short-course (TB) kills or debilitates more adults ages15-59 than any other disease and is responsible forabout 2 to 4 percent of the burden of disease. It is thesingle leading cause of death in developing countries,accounting for about 2 million deaths a year, or ap-proximately 5 percent of all deaths and 25 percent ofpreventable adult deaths in those countries. Morewomen of childbearing age die from TB than fromcauses associated with pregnancy and childbirth. Morethan half of the world's population is infected with theTB bacillus. People who are malnourished or have an-other severe illness are at particular risk for TB, as arethose infected with HIV. The relationship between TBand HIV is highly significant, as each person infectedwith HIV and TB could infect twelve other personswith TB per year.Annual incidence rates of all forms of clinical TB varyfrom 50 to 260 per 100,000 in the developing world;more than half of these cases are infectious (sputum-smear-positive). For most forms of TB, 50 to 60 percentof those infected will die if untreated. All ages are atrisk, but the peak isin young adulthood. In Sub-Saharan Africa the annual risks of infection remainhigh, partly because of poverty and overcrowding(which are risk factors for TB) and partly because anydecrease in the annual risk of infection is offset by theHIV epidemic. In India and Sub-Saharan Africa TB isthe leading cause of death and the biggest contributorto the disease burden; it is responsible for about 8 to 11percent of the DALYs lost in the 15-59 age group.There are two effective approaches to treating TB:short-course chemotherapy, which uses three to fivedrugs over six to eight months, and the \"standard\"course of two to three drugs taken over twelve to eigh-teen months. Drugs for the short course cost about $50to $80 per patient. Those for the standard course costonly $10 to $15, but the cost per death averted is higherbecause only 30 percent of patients complete treatmentand are cured, as against 60 percent for the shortcourse. Other benefits of the short course include asmaller number of resistant organisms and less needfor expensive retreatment. (This discussion applies tothe treatment of sputum-smear-positive TB. Onceother forms of TB have been identified, treatment costsshould be similar except for serious forms of smear-negative TB.)Walk-in treatment is less expensive than hospitaliza-tion, but if this care cannot be closely monitored (as inmany rural areas), hospitalization may be more cost-effective. The program described is modeled on pas-sive case investigation, assuming that a person with TBwill have symptoms such as cough and weight loss andwill seek care and that infected persons discovered byactive searches will be less likely to continue treatmentthan those who seek care. Although the BCG vaccina-tion is important in TB control for children, its effec-tiveness in adults is still under investigation.The cost of treatment is less than $10 per DALY in allchemotherapy scenarios. Itis estimated that tuber-culosis treatment of infectious (smear-positive) individ-uals prevents one to four new cases by stopping trans-mission. The positive externalities of short-coursechemotherapy explain in part the extremely favorablecost-effectiveness and justify government intervention.Because the cost of drugs, at $50 to $80 per patient, isprobably too high for the poor, public subsidy is espe-cially warranted for low-income households. ernment policies that emphasized the financing ofcost-effective clinical services directed especially atthe rural poor.Benefits, costs, and financing of the essential clinicalpackageWidespread adoption of the minimum clinicalpackage would have a tremendous positive effecton the health of people in developing countries. If80 percent of the population were reached, 24 per-cent of the current burden of disease in low-income countries and 11 percent in middle-incomecountries could be averted (Table 5.3). When theminimum clinical package is combined with thepublic health package outlined in Chapter 4, theshare of current illness that could be eliminatedrises to approximately 32 percent in low-incomecountries and 15 percent in middle-income coun- 116tries. This reduction in the burden of diseasewould be equivalent to saving the lives of morethan 9 million infants each year.Delivery of the minimum clinical package wouldcost an average of about $8 per person each year inlow-income countries and about $15 in middle-income countries. Approximately half of theseamounts would be for prenatal and delivery carealone. When the cost of selected public health in-terventions is added, total costs rise to $12 per cap-ita in low-income countries and $22 in middle-income countries. The differences are the result ofdifferent demographic structures, epidemiologicalconditions, and labor costs in the two settings.In low-income countries, where governmentstypically spend about $5.50 per person for healthand where total health expenditures are about$14 per person (Figure 5.2), the affordability of theTable 5.3 Estimated costs and health benefits of selected public health and clinical services in low-and middle-income countries, 1990 Note: Figures assume coverage of 80 percent of the population.Average benefits.Includes EPI education; information on health, nutrition,and family planning; tobacco and alcohol control programs; monitoring and surveillance; vector control; and programs for prevention of AIDS.Benefits were calculated assuming an AIDS epidemic comparable to that in Sub-Saharan Africa today.Limited care includes assessment, advice, alleviation of pain, treatment of infection and minor trauma, and treatment of more complicatedconditions as resources permit.Source: World Bank calculations. Because the poorest countries spend far less on health than do middle-income countries and the public share issmaller, thei have fewer resources available for reallocation.

Paying forthe package would require an increase in publicspending for health (part of which could be fi-nanced by donors in the short term), as well as areorientation of current government expenditurefor health from discretionary to essential care. Inmiddle-income countries, where public spendingfor health averages about $62 per person, the$22 minimum package is financially feasible ifthere is adequate political commitment to shift ex-isting resources in the direction of public healthand essential clinical care. Indeed, upper-middle-income countries can afford public finance of anessential package that goes well beyond thisminimum.Who should pay for the essential clinical pack-age? There are strong efficiency arguments for di-rect financing by developing country governmentsof the selected public health interventions dis-cussed in Chapter 4. A number of the essentialclinical services, including treatment of tuber-culosis and STDs, have large positive externalities.What is more important is that the poor are dispro-portionately affected by the disease burden of theconditions listed in Table 5.3 and that, because oflarger family sizes, they would benefit dispropor-tionately from prenatal, delivery, and childhoodservices. Public finance of a basic package of ser-vices is an effective mechanism for reaching thepoor.The main problem with universal governmentfinancing of an essential package is that it leads topublic subsidies to the wealthy, who could affordto pay for their own services, with the result thatfewer government resources go to serve the poor.A policy of concentrating public resources on ser-vices for the poor and requiring others to pay all orpart of their own costs makes sense on equitygrounds but also has some disadvantages. Often,the administrative costs of targeting are high, andthe exclusion of wealthy and middle-incomegroups can erode political support for the essentialpackage, causing a decline in funding and qualityof care. Furthermore, problems of cost escalationand access to insurance on the part of high-riskgroupsdiscussed in Chapter 3can complicatereliance on private finance. Perhaps for these rea-sons, most member governments of the OECD fi-nance (or mandate finance of) comprehensivelydefined essential packages for virtually all theircitizens.In low-income countries, where current publicspending for health is less than the cost of an es- 118sential package, some degree of targeting is almostinevitable. In countries where the wealthy do notuse government-financed services because of thegreater quality and convenience of privately f i-nanced services, targeting may be fairly easy. Inother cases, however, user charges will have to beapplied selectively, relying on means testing andother targeting devices (see Box 5.5). Special ame-nities in teaching hospitals, for example, can bepriced at or above cost, since they will be con-sumed exclusively by the wealthy. User chargescan help generate additional revenues for the es-sential package, amounting to perhaps 10 to 20percent of total government spending for health.Finally, directing donor funding to public healthand essential clinical care can significantly expandthe total resource basket available for the mini-mum package.User charges for public health services in devel-oping countries have sparked much debate sincethe World Bank endorsed the concept in 1987 in apolicy study on health financing. Critics argue thatfees restrict access to care, especially for the poor.Yet many developing countries, particularly inSub-Saharan Africa, have been forced to rely in-creasingly on fees to supplement strained budgets.Studies on the effect of user fees are inconclusiveand contradictory. One reason is that some re-searchers have failed to calculate the true cost topatients of treatment at government clinics. Peopleoften pay dearly for supposedly \"free\" healthcare. Recent household surveys in India, Indo-nesia, and Viet Nam indicate that each visit to agovernment health center actually costs patientstwo to three times the amount of the low officialfees. Bribes aside, the indirect costs such as trans-port and the opportunity cost of time spent seek-ing care are substantial.Since patients are already paying for supposedlyfree or low-cost health care, new user fees, whenaccompanied by a reduction in indirect costs andimprovement of services, may increase utilization.Recent studies in four African countriesBenin,Cameroon, Guinea, and Sierra Leoneindicatethat this is the case and, encouragingly, that thepoor benefited most from these changes. Since fa-cilities used fees to fund services not previouslyavailable locally, poor patients avoided costlytravel, and the actual cost of care declined. Studiesindicate that user fees amounting to less than 1percent of annual household income have little im-pact on the utilization of health services, even bythe poor. Because higher fees do decrease utiliza-When public spending on health is not targeted to thepooras often happens, according tonumerousstudiesno other source of funds is likely to compen-sate. Which targeting mechanisms work best in prac-tice will depend on their impact on demand, their ad-ministrative costs,their technical and managerialrequirements, and the level of political support. Incountries where incomes are too low for a minimumessential package to be provided universally, there arefour main mechanisms for targeting the essential pack-age of services:Assess individuals seeking services on the basis ofincome, nutritional status, or other criteria and, de-pending on the assessment, provide services from theessential clinical package free of charge or according toa sliding scale of fees. In evaluating income, directmeasurements or proxies (such as housing characteris-tics) can be used, but this tends to be more adminis-tratively costly than other mechanisms.Subsidize essential clinical services for easily iden-tified subgroups of the population (for example, allthose living in certain low-income regions or neighbor-hoods or all children in public schools). Where socialinsurance mechanisms (usually financed through pay-roll taxes) exist, they generally tend to cover the rela-Box 5.5Targeting public expenditure to the poortively well-off. Targeting public finance to those notparticipating in social insurance will reach the poor,and administration will be relatively simple. In coun-tries with established social insurance mechanisms,this targeting mechanism will often prove best.Let individuals self-target. The essential servicesare available free of charge to all, but the program isdesigned in such a way as to deter the better-off fromusing them. Time costs, stigma, and fewer amenitiesassociated with services are the usual mechanisms forencouraging self-targeting. Unfortunately, these samecharacteristics may discourage the poor as well as thebetter-off. Low-income working mothers, for example,may find that the time, for themselves and their chil-dren, involved in using subsidized services is an insur-mountable obstacle.Target by type of service. Offer free of charge, orsubsidize heavily, services that are needed dispropor-tionately by the poor. This sort of targeting mechanismis inherent in much of the essential package of clinicalservices. Prenatal and delivery services, managementof the sick child, and STD and tuberculosis treatmentare all services that, if universally available, would es-pecially benefit the poor. tion, reducing charges or exempting the poor fromthe fees may be warranted.In middle-income countries, where a significantpart of the population may be covered by privateor social insurance, governments can target publicmonies to essential clinical services for the poor bylegally defining and mandating that the nationalessential package be covered in all insurance poli-cies, thereby freeing government resources to tar-get the poor. Surprisingly, emerging managed careinstitutions in developing countries often fail tocover benefits that would be in such an essentialpackage. In the 1980s in Brazil, for example, manyhealth maintenance organizations failed to includeimmunizations and family planning in the basicbenefits package for their clienteles.Insurance and finance of discretionary clinicalservicesPublic financing of a national essential clinicalpackage can be justified because the package cre-ates positive externalities and reduces poverty.The case for government financing of discretion-ary clinical health careservices outside the essen-tial packageis far less compelling. In fact, gov-ernments can promote both efficiency and equityby reducingor, when possible, eliminatingpublic funding for these services. Doing so re-quires recovering the cost of discretionary servicesprovided in government health facilities and cut-ting subsidies to private and public insuranceschemes that finance discretionary care. By reduc-ing spending on these services, governments canconcentrate public expenditure where it will do themost goodin public health and cost effective clin-ical services.Out-of-pocket payments are the main source offinancing for discretionary care in low-incomecountries. They remain substantial in middle-income countries, but insurance becomes increas-ingly important as incomes rise. Because, exceptfor the very rich, out-of-pocket financing cannotcover expensive care or deal with catastrophic ill-ness, widespread financing of discretionary care ispossible only through insurance. Countries havetwo main options for meeting a growing demandand need for insurance. One is to move toward the 119current U.S. system, which relies substantially onprivate voluntary insurance. The other is to followthe examples of Canada, Japan, and most Eu-ropean countries, where general government reve-nues or social insurance cover the cost of relativelycomprehensive essential packages, leaving only asmall discretionary residual for private insurance.Government policy can improve the functioningof insurance markets in three ways. It can strive toeliminate unfair subsidies to insurance. It canwork to maximize the population covered by in-surance by preventing selection biasthe ten-dency of insurers to discriminate against badhealth risks. And it can help to eliminate anotherpotential problem with insurance: the explosiveincreases in health care costs that are closely asso-ciated with fee-for-service payment of health pro-viders by third-party insurers.Redirecting public funding from discretionary careThere is substantial scope in the developing worldfor redirecting current public spending away fromdiscretionary services. Cost recovery in govern-ment hospitals, especially from the wealthy andinsured, is one important mechanism. Even inlow-income countries, where insurance may ac-count for less than 5 percent of total health spend-ing, as in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Pakistan, and Table 5.4 Social insurance in selected countries, 1990 120the Philippines, a combination of limited privateinsurance and the ability of upper-income groupsto pay makes it feasible for governments to chargefor discretionary care delivered in public hospitals.In Kenya the government is currently attemptingto recover the cost of caring for the insured at thenational referral hospital in Nairobi. In Lesothocharges in the private ward of the central hospitalin Maseru were increased in 1990 to recover costsfrom wealthier patients.In middle-income countries insurance becomesmore important as a mechanism for financing dis-cretionary services. In South Africa private insur-ance covers about 15 percent of the population andaccounts for more than a third of total healthspending. In Brazil, even though everyone is eligi-ble for publicly financed health services, about afifth of the population is also privately insured.Social insurance, in which payroll deductions areearmarked for health care, is widespread in mid-dle-income countries, especially in Latin America.Such payroll taxes account for a quarter or more ofnational health spending in Costa Rica, Korea, andPanama (Table 5.4). In countries with broader in-surance coverage there is even greater potential forcost recovery than in poorer countries. Public hos-pitals in Chile are now being encouraged tocharge, particularly for patients who have privateinsurance. 1992.(percent)Social share ofShare of population covered public sector healthSocial insurance as share of Health expenditure as Group and country by social insurance expendituretotal health expenditure share of GNPLow-incomeIndia 59 26.0 Kenya 10 7 44.3 Indonesia 13 17 62.0Middle-incomeDominican Rep. 6 9 63.7 Ecuador 9 11 74.1 Colombia 15 18 84.0 Paraguay 18 24 132.8 Philippines 38 12 62.8 Panama 50 55 43 7.1 Turkey 58 26 144.0 Costa Rica 82 85 626.5 Korea, Rep. of 90 50 256.6High-incomeGermany 75 76 638.0 Japan 100 64 566.5 France 100 95 718.9 Netherlands 100 94 737.9The other way to redirect government spendingaway from discretionary care is to phase out publicsubsidies to insurance. These subsidies, which arelarge and widespread, take the form of both directbudgetary transfers to insurance institutions andtax concessions for employers' and employees' in-surance contributions. They benefit the better-offand are therefore regressive.In Latin America governments in Guatemala,Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuelacontribute a percentage of individual workers'wages to social security sickness and maternityfunds. In Chile and Uruguay the government cov-ers the operating deficits of the funds, and in Co-lombia and El Salvador it pays directly for a part ofthe cost of social security health services and ad-ministration. Private insurance in South Africaand Zimbabwe receives large public subsidies inthe form of tax deductions for employer and em-ployee contributions. Fees to insured patientsusing government hospitals in Zimbabwe are setat perhaps a third to a quarter of actual costs, pro-viding another subsidy to the better-off.Once subsidies to private and public insuranceare established, they are extremely difficult toeliminate. Recipientsgenerally the better-off-view them as an important benefit. The currentdebate in the United States over reducing the em-ployer tax deduction for contributions to medicalinsurance illustrates this strong political resis-tance. To date, very few developing countries havesuccessfully cut subsidies. An exception is Zim-babwe, where major political shiftsnational inde-pendence and the advent of a democratically elec-ted government in 1980led to asignificantscaling back of tax breaks for medical aid pre-miums. The Chilean government is actively con-sidering eliminating the existing tax concession foremployers' contributions to social insurance.Subsidies to insurance systems that cover onlypart of the population are invariably regressive,but subsidies can be progressive when insurancehas become universal. At that point, public sub-sidies end up benefiting mainly those outside theformal labor force, notably the elderly and thepoor. Examples of progressive subsidies are the 30percent of national social insurance funding thatthe Korean government contributes on behalf oflow-income households and the 20 percent of Ja-pan's social insurance spending that derives fromgovernment budget transfers for retirees and thepoor. Governments could provide equally pro-gressive, targeted subsidies to buy regulated pri-vate health insurance for the poor, but there is noexperience with such arrangements in developingcountries.Eliminating unequal access to clinical careunder insuranceA serious problem with relying on insurance topay for discretionary care in developing countriesis that individuals and groups often have unequalaccess to insurance coverage. The problem is espe-cially acute with voluntary private insurance be-cause of selection bias. When insurers rate individ-ual risks, they often either refuse to insure the sickand elderly or make insurance prohibitively ex-pensive for these clients because their expectedcosts are so high. They also commonly excludemany health conditions that should ideally be cov-ered. In Brazil, for example, where governmentregulation of insurance is weak, private insurersfrequently refuse to enroll persons who are poorhealth risks, and they fail to cover costly risks suchas HIV-AIDS. In South Africa and Zimbabwe pri-vate health insurance schemes known as medicalaid societies have historically covered entire indus-tries and occupational groups, but the recent mar-keting of individual insurance policies has intro-duced discrimination based on risk. Selection biasis an important reason for the incomplete insur-ance coverage in the United States, where 37 mil-lion people, or about 15 percent of the population,are uninsured.Very few countries, developing or industrial,have managed to eliminate selection bias underprivate insurance, even though it could theo-retically be done by prohibiting insurers from rat-ing individuals' health risks and requiring them torate only large groups, or \"communities,\" inwhich high risks are spread over a large number ofpeople to minimize the cost effect of the risks.Eliminating selection bias is easier with social in-surance because contributions are compulsory andare normally a fixed percentage of wages for allemployees regardless of their number of depen-dents or their individual health risks. The snag isthat since compulsory insurance generally usesemployment-based contributions, itisable toachieve broad coverage only when most of the eco-nomically active population is in the formal laborforce.Where only part of the population is covered byinsurance, as in most developing countries, accessto clinical services for the uninsured poor can bemuch more difficult than for insured, better-offpeople. The quality of care, including essential 121clinical services, may also be vastly inferior for thepoor. In low-income Africa the wealthy consultprivate doctors for their clinical care while the poorare often forced to use understaffed governmenthealth centers that lack the most basic drugs andequipment. In much of Latin America middle-classfamilies receive better care in hospitals and clinicsbelonging to the social security agency than thepoor are given in the badly deteriorated facilitiesrun by the ministry of health.One way to eliminate these disparities would beto put all health facilities under a single adminis-tration and open them to all. Few countries havetaken on this politically and administratively diff i-cult task. Costa Rica, in which the social securityagency manages all government hospitals, is a rareexception. Another solution is for the governmentto focus spending on the poor by investing heavilyin the infrastructure (facilities, equipment, andtransport) needed to improve essential clinical carefor the poor and spending substantially more onthe associated personnel and drugs. By focusinginvestments on peripheral health units (healthcenters, subcenters, and health posts) and on stafffor these facilities, Malaysia and Zimbabwe havesuccessfully upgraded separate clinical servicestargeted to the poor.Containing the costs of clinical careEscalating health spending is perceived as a crisiswhen it begins to crowd out other sectors of theeconomy or to raise the cost of labor, threatening acountry's international competitiveness. This iscurrently happening in the United States and to avarying extent in other high-income countries (Box5.6), and it is about to happen in several middle-income developing countries, including Chile andKorea.The sources of excess health costs and growth ofcosts are complex and much debated. Health ser-vices have a high labor content, and their produc-tivity has grown slowly in comparison with that ofother areas of the economy. In the United Statesrelatively high levels of underlying morbidity andgreater amenities in hospitals are part of the rea-son, but inefficiencies are also important. Twotypes of inefficiency stand out: high administrativecosts and unnecessary use of an ever-expandingarray of sophisticated and ever more costly tech-nologies for diagnostic tests and surgical pro- Box 5.6Containing health care costs in industrial countriesIn 1990 the United States devoted 12.7 percent of itsGNP to health, as against 9.1 percent in Canada, 8.9percent in France, 8.0 percent in Germany, 6.5 percentin Japan, and 6.1 percent in the United Kingdom. The2.7 percent annual increase in the health-to-GNP ratiofor the United States during the 1980s was the highestamong the OECD countries. U.S. health expendituresof $2,800 per person in 1990 were nearly $1,000 abovethe average for the OECD countries. The price ofhealth care services in relation to other goods and ser-vices also rose much more rapidly in the United States(2.2 percent per year)than inthe other OECDcountries.An important factor in explaining the rapid growthin health care costs in the United States is that doctorsand hospitals are paid predominantly on a fee-for-ser-vice basis. Countries experiencing moderate spendinggrowth (Canada and Japan) also use fee-for-service fotoutpatient physician care but have devised other waysof controlling expenditures: a uniform fee structureand aggressive peer review of doctors' spending pat-terns in Japan and fixed overall budgets for hospitals inCanada. Countries with low levels of spending (theUnited Kingdom) or low recent growth of costs (Den-mark, Germany, and Sweden) set overall limits on pay-ments to both doctors and hospitals. In the lattergroup, the method of limiting payments to doctorsvaries widely: capitation in Britain, fee-for-service inGermany, and salaries in Sweden. In Germany, as ameans of controlling expenditure, fees are reduced ifthe volume of services exceeds the anticipated level. Ingeneral, the OECD countries that have contained costsbetter have greater government control of healthspending and a larger public sector share of total healthexpenditures. This is also the case in eleven developingcountries with income per capita of more than $6,000.In the poorer countries there is no apparent link be-tween the public and private shares of health expendi-ture and the proportion of income devoted to health.In the U.S. health insurance system, with its largenumbers of insurers reimbursing providers at differentrates, administrative costs absorb about 15 percent ofhealth expenditures, compared with 5 percent or lessin the other OECD countries. If the United States re-duced its administrative outlays to the level in theseother countries, a total of $80 billion annually could besaved, equivalent to about a third of total health spend-ing for all developing countries combined. 122cedures. These two kinds of inefficiency appear tobe closely linked to basic features of the U.S.health system. Open-ended fee-for-service com-pensation for health providers encourages the de-velopment of new equipment, drugs, and pro-cedures and leads to exploding costs becauseneither providers nor patients have strong incen-tives to hold down utilization or spending. A com-plex system of multiple insurance institutions andother payers, each with its own procedures, raisesadministrative overheads substantially.The findings concerning health cost escalation inthe United States and other industrial countriesare especially relevant for middle-income develop-ing countries. Those countries are under pressurefrom medical professionals, manufacturers, andconsumers to use new medical technologies, andthey face difficult policy choices related to insur-ance institutions and compensation of providers.Korea's problems with escalating health expendi-tures parallel those of the United States and mayhold important lessons for other developingcountries.The Korean social insurance system is a nation-wide network of \"sickness funds\" covering occu-pational and regional groups. Worker payroll con-tributionsarecompulsory.AllKoreansarecovered, and the government subsidy to extendcoverage to the elderly and indigent is highlyprogressive. As in the United States, Korea'shealth providers are predominantly private-72percent of physicians and 80 percent of hospitalbeds are in this categoryand they are paid on afee-for-service basis. There is little control of theacquisition of medical technologies. Korea alreadyhas more sophisticated new medical equipment,such as imaging machines and lithotripters (usedto treat kidney stones), per capita than either Can-ada or Germany. During 1989-91 spending formedical devices and diagnostic products grew bymore than 20 percent a year. As in Japan, physi-cians often sell the drugs they prescribe, and in-surance reimburses the cost of nonprescriptiondrugs, which creates strong incentives to over-prescribe and overuse drugs. Prescription phar-maceuticals now account for 36 percent of healthspending, one of the highest shares anywhere. Fi-nally, the administrative costs associated with themore than 300 independent insurance funds are 10to 20 percent of operating expenses, which is simi-lar to the administrative burden of private insur-ance in the United States.All these causes contributed to a dramatic in-crease in health spending in the past decade, faroutstripping Korea'srobustoverall economicgrowth. The share of GNP devoted to health rosefrom 3.7 percent in 1980 to 6.6 percent in 1990. By1990 Korea was spending $377 per capita forhealth, putting it 50 percent above the expectedlevel for its income.To control health care costs, countries need tolimit payments to health care providers (Table 5.5).One approach is to pay a fixed amount for eachperson, as is now done by health maintenance or-ganizations in Brazil and the United States and bythe British National Health Service. Anothermethod, used in several OECD countries, is togive each hospital or network of physicians a fixedtotal budget (Box 5.7).Insurers may jointly negotiate uniform fees forphysicians, as is done by Japan's social insurancesystem and by Zimbabwe's private insurance sys-tem. They can also set fixed payments for specifiedmedical procedures or standard per diem pay-ments for hospital stays. Brazil's social insurancesystem, for example, is paying standard fees forhospital care according to a modified version of thesystem of diagnostic-related groups that was de-veloped in the United States for Medicare, thegovernment-funded system for the elderly. Chile'spublic health system is introducing comparable in-ternal prices for its hospitals.As worldwide experience amply demonstrates,there is no perfect insurance system: every coun-try's insurance institutions have their problems.But there are two important generalizations: third-party insurance leads to cost escalation, and, ingeneral, social insurance and regulated private in-surance with community rating avoid selectionbias far better than voluntary private insurance. Itis difficult to achieve wide coverage of the popula-tion in most developing countries, and withoutwide coverage, public subsidies to insurance willinevitably be regressive. Countries, whether theyuse social or private insurance, are finding it ex-tremely hard to eliminate these deeply entrenchedsubsidies. Once widespread insurance coverage isachieved, costs can easily spin out of control un-less provider compensation is tightly regulated ordetermined in ways that give incentives for costcontainment. Developing country governmentsmust be prepared to deal forthrightly with this dif-ficult set of interlocking issues.Delivery of clinical servicesPolicies related to the delivery of health services indeveloping countries should have two main objec-tives. The first is to improve access to essential 123Table 5.5 Strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods of paying health providers Payment method Fee for service Per case(for example, usingdiagnostic-relatedgroups) Capifation(per patient undercontinuous care) reward closely linked tolevel of effort and outputAllows for easy analysis ofprovider's practice Provider's reward fairly well tied tooutput Gives provider incentive to minimizeresource use per individual treated Administratively simple; no need tobreak down physician's work intoprocedures or casesFacilitates prospective budgeting Gives provider incentive to minimizecost of treatmentAllows for consumer clout if patientcan select own provider Administratively simplest Facilitates prospective budgetingWeaknesses Tends to cause cost inflation Creates incentives for excessive andunnecessary treatment Technical difficulty of forcing all casesinto standard list can lead to mismatchbetween output and rewardProviders may misrepresent diagnosisin order to receive higher payment Gives provider incentive to selectpatients based on risk and to rejecthigh-cost patientsMay create incentives for providerto underservice accepted patientsDifficult to analyze provider's practice Loss of patient influence over providerbehavior unless patient choice linksprovider salary to patient satisfactionCan easily create incentives for providerto underservice patient and to reduceproductivity Source: Adapted from Reinhardt 1989. clinical services, especially for the poor. The sec-ond is to increase the efficiency with which ser-vices are delivered. In the public sector inefficiencyis widespread. Clinics and outreach programs op-erate poorly because of shortages of drugs, trans-port, and maintenance. Hospitals are poorly orga-nized and managed and keep patients longer thannecessary. Countries pay too much for drugs of 124low efficacy, and drugs and supplies are stolen orgo to waste in government warehouses and hospi-tals. Although the problems are many and deep,appropriate government policies can do much toreduce or eliminate these kinds of inefficiency.Most countries have mixed systems of both pub-lic and private delivery of clinical services and bothpublic and private financing. The type of financinga country chooses does not dictate the kind ofhealth delivery system it should have, or the otherway around. Some countries, such as Botswana,Malaysia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, havemainly public financing and public delivery; some,including Brazil and Korea, have public financingand private delivery; and still others, such as thePhilippines, the United States, and Zaire, rely pri-marily on private financing and private delivery.The private health sector typically serves a di-verse clientele, and it typically delivers servicesthat are perceived to be high in quality and moreresponsive to consumer demand than the govern-ment's. But there are also examples of highly effi-cient public sector health centers and district hos-pitals (for example, in Chile, China, Sri Lanka, andZimbabwe), and there are circumstances in whichit is impossible or too costly to persuade the pri-vate sector to deliver careparticularly in geo-graphically remote or extremely poor areas.The existence of alternative suppliers, both pub-lic and private, creates pressure for improved per-formance. In developing countries where the pub-lic system has a near-monopoly on health caredelivery, a mixed system that exposes the publicservices to competition is likely to be more efficientand to improve quality of care. Furthermore, incountries where government health services are -S Box 5.7Health care reform in the OECDThe OECD countries face persistent difficulties in thefinancing and delivery of health services. Problems in-clude inequitable access to services, gaps in insurancecoverage, unacceptably rapid increases in health ex-penditure, inefficiency, and poor quality. These diffi-culties are partly the result of circumstances outside thecontrol of governmentsfor example, demographicand technological change. To some extent, however,they arise from flaws in the design of the financing,payment, and regulation systems for health care. Dur-ing the 1980s most OECD countries initiated moderateor major reforms of their health care systems to correctthese flaws.Three principal types of reforms can be distin-guished. Several countries,including Ireland,theNetherlands, and Spain, have taken steps to extend eli-gibility for public medical care, bringing the last remain-ing groups of their populations into the public systemof coverage for basic medical care. Despite widespreadcalls for privatization of finance, no country has re-duced its commitment to public coverage.Many governments have taken important initiativesto contain costs, through increased cost sharing orthrough supply-side reforms. Belgium, France, Ger-many, and the Netherlands have set fixed budgets forhospital expenditure. Virtually all the OECD countriesgreatly reduced the rate of growth of health expendi-tures during the 1980s. The biggest exception was theUnited States. Those countries that still relied to someextent on the reimbursement of patients for medicalbills, with no connection between insurers and pro-viders, were less successful in containing costs hanthose in which insurers had direct contracts or in whicha public agency was both public insurer and healthprovider.Probably the most important reforms of the 1980sinvolved the introduction of improved incentives and reg-ulations for providers and insurers, with the aim of rais-ing the productivity of rationed resources. There hasbeen some convergence of systems toward contractingbetween public insurers and private providers. Bel-gium and France have introduced tighter contracts intotheir reimbursement systems, and the United King-dom has moved away from its integrated NationalHealth Service and toward more autonomous andcompetitive physicians and hospitals. Other countriesreformed the contractual model itself by emphasizingconsumer choice, active informed purchasing ratherthan passive funding by third parties, and managedcompetition among providers. These reforms are mostmarked in Germany, but elements of such changeshave also been implemented in Belgium and theNetherlands in the form of mixed payment systemsthat combine budgetary caps with work-related pay-ment of providers.Finally, the Netherlands and the United Kingdomhave embarked on differing experiments to introducecompetition within their public systems. In the Nether-lands it is envisaged that consumers will be able tochoose among quasi-public sickness funds and privateinsurers, with a central health care fund taking income-related premiums and paying out risk-related pre-miums to the competing insurers. This amounts to asophisticated health voucher scheme. In the UnitedKingdom part of the hospital budget is given to large(competing) general practices, which will enable gen-eral practitioners to purchase certain hospital serviceson behalf of their patients. Since the reforms were in-troduced only recently in the United Kingdom and arebeing carried out gradually in the Netherlands, it is notyet possible to evaluate them fully. There are, however,already signs that general practitioner \"Iundholders\"in the United Kingdom are using their new purchasingpower to negotiate a higher quality of hospital servicesfor their patients. 125126Table 5.6 Policies to improve delivery of health care Provider and policy Public sectorProtect nonsalary recurrent spendingComplete the district health delivery infrastructure Retain fees at point of collectionDecentralize financial resources and operational authoritySubcontract ancillary services to private sectorImprove drug selection, procurement, and useNongovernmental organizationsLegalize and simplify registrationProvide government subsidies (per case, per diem, or block grants)for essential clinical servicesSubsidize training for district health workersPrivate (for-profit) sectorRemove legal barriers to practicePromote health maintenance organizationsEstablish managed competition among suppliersRegulate private hospitals and physiciansProvide public subsidies for essential clinical services and selectedpublic health interventions both overextended and excessively concentratedon discretionary care at the expense of essentialservices for the poor, the public system needs to bescaled back.

At the sametime, governments have to improve the equity andefficiency of their remaining health programs andfacilities, through selective and progressive usercharges, decentralization, managerial incentives,and better information systems. The key policiesSignificantU Moderate0 Modest0 No significant impactfor improving delivery of clinical services by gov-ernment, NGO, and private for-profit providersare shown in Table 5.6.Delivering the essential packageIn a competitive health system, people seekinghealth services can choose from a diversity of pro-viderspublic, private nonprofit, and private for-profit. As developing countries move toward sucha competitive system, they face a wide range ofpolicy options that can improve the delivery of theessential clinical package.THE PUBLIC SECTOR. For many countries an im-portant step in improving access to government-provided essential clinical services is to completethe basic district health infrastructure by buildinghealth centers and health posts and training morenurses, midwives, and other providers of primarycare. Provision of good-quality housing for ruralhealth workers as part of the district health infra-structure can improve efficiency by encouragingstaff to move to rural areas. Zimbabwe doubledthe number of its rural health centers, from 500 tomore than 1,000, during the period 1980-90 withthe goal of making essential clinical services avail-able within 8 kilometers of home for the wholepopulation. When housing for rural physiciansand nurses was added to the district health pro-gram in the mid-1980s, the effect on staff recruit-ment and retention was enormous: vacancy ratesfor physicians and nurses in the areas with newhousing fell to zero, as against 20 to 30 percentelsewhere.Government recurrent spending for primarycare inputs other than salaries is particularly vul-nerable to budget cuts. When revenue shortfallsoccuror tertiary care hospitals overspendser-vices in peripheral facilities and communities oftensuffer. In countries such as Chad, Haiti, Mozam-bique, and Nepal there are widespread reports ofhealth centers that have staff but few or no drugsand of mobile health teams with little or no gas-oline for their vehicles. Under these circumstancestechnical efficiency falls to near zerogovern-ments continue to pay staff salaries, but virtuallyno meaningful health services can be delivered.Protecting the nonsalary part of the budget isextremely difficult but critical. In Senegal the gov-ernment is currently committed to increasing itsbudgetary allocation for drugs and medical sup-plies by 10 percent a year in real terms during1992-96. Mauritania has set targets for annual gov-ernment spending on drugs and other nonsalaryoperating expenditures for its thirteen predomi-nantly rural health regions. Countries can alsoprotect nonsalary spending by introducing moreflexibility into their hiring arrangements. In Indiathe Ministry of Health is planning to hire 8,000workers for a leprosy control project on a per diembasis rather than engage them as civil servantswith virtual lifetime guarantees of employment.Another policy for ensuring adequate spendingon essential clinical services for the poor is to allowprimary care facilities to retain user charges andspend these revenues on drug supplies and incen-tive bonuses for health workers. In Cameroonwhen fees were introduced in a group of ruralhealth centers and the revenues collected wereused to replenish drug supplies, utilization of thecentersespecially by low-income familiesin-creased substantially. The percentage of sick peo-ple living near those centers who sought care roseby more than 25 percent compared with the areaswhere fees were not charged, demonstrating thatuser fees can actually increase services for thepoor. NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.Privatenonprofit institutions, both local and foreign, pro-vide a significant share of health services in devel-oping countries, delivering essential clinical ser-vices to low-income households in the poorestcountries. NGOs provide a third or more of allclinicalcareinCameroon,Ghana,Malawi,Uganda, and Zambia. They own a quarter of thehealth facilities in Bolivia's three largest cities, andthey supply more than 10 percent of clinical ser-vices in India and Indonesia. Although it is diffi-cult to compare the performances of NGO andgovernment health facilities, recent data from Af-rica suggest that NGOs are often more efficientthan the public sector. In Uganda physicians inchurch mission hospitals treated an average of fivetimes as many patients as physicians in govern-ment facilities, and NGO nurses attended morethan twice as many patients as their governmentcounterparts. Governments that have excludedNGOs or heavily restricted their operations haveseen essential services deteriorate. When Mozam-bique decided after independence in 1975 to banNGO health activities in favor of government-runfacilities, a wide range of health services in ruralareas suddenly disappeared. Where such bans orbarriers to NGO activity exist, they should beremoved.Beyond this, there are important opportunitiesfor governments to form constructive partnerships 127with NGOs to deliver essential clinical services.One approach being followed in Sub-Saharan Af-rica and in some states of India is to incorporateNGO health centers into the network of public f a-cilities by nominating appropriately located NGOhospitals as district (first level of referral) hospi-tals. The NGOs are expected to provide a range ofpublic health and clinical services and to performspecific districtwide functions such as health plan-ning, supervision of lower-level clinics and com-munity activities, and maintenance of emergencytransport. In return, the government pays some ofthe NGOs' costs.This kind of government-NGO collaborationtakes a variety of forms. In Lesotho nine of thecountry's eighteen health service areas (districts)are headed by a church mission hospital that car-ries out comprehensive health planning and man-agement for its entire area. In Zimbabwe govern-ment funds for rural health improvement arebeing used to expand mission (\"designated dis-trict\") hospitals and to purchase ambulances forthe NGOs. Ministries of health pay the salaries ofnursing staff in mission hospitals in Zaire andmost of the recurrent costs of NGO facilities inBotswana. Government donation of free vaccinesand contraceptives to NGO health providers hasalso become a common way to target public sub-sidies to specific health intervention programs. THE PRIVATE SECTOR. In recognition of the grow-ing importance of the modern private sector indeveloping countries' health systems, some gov-ernments have begun to encourage private practi-tioners to deliver essential services. In India sev-eral states and nonprofit groups are working withthe private sectorincluding the country's 1 mil-lion semiqualified urban and rural medical practi-tionersto improve the quality and effectivenessof basic care. Some innovative approaches are be-ing tried: private distribution outlets are beingstocked with condoms and oral rehydration solu-tion to make both more widely available, and theIndian Rural Medical Association is trying to im-prove theskillsof rural private practitionersthrough education on such subjects as family plan-ning, immunization, and oral rehydration. InMali, one of the world's poorest countries, the local medical school has started a program to traingraduates to set up private practices in smalltowns of 15,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. Althoughexperience is recent, a number of physicians havealready established successful private practices inthese towns, and they have demonstrated that 128small-town families are prepared to pay for goodcare. The average outpatient visit costs $2 and anormal delivery $8.In Africa and Asia traditional medicine remainsan important part of the health care system, some-times accounting for more than 10 percent of totalspending. The number of traditional healersin-cluding herbalists, bonesetters, faith birth typically manytimes larger than the number of medical physi-cians. The ratio of traditional to modern healthpractitioners has been estimated at nine to one inSri Lanka, seventeen to one in Indonesia, twenty-five to one in Ghana, and twenty-eight to one inNigeria. Under these circumstances there may beopportunities for governments to improve the de-livery of essential health services by using tradi-tional practitioners. Successful examples includethe use of traditional healers to screen for malariaand to distribute antimalarial drugs in Thailand, topromote modern contraceptives in Kenya, and todistribute condoms to reduce HIV and STD trans-mission in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Traditionalbirth attendants have also been enlisted to im-prove pregnancy outcomes in many countries, in-cluding Bangladesh (Box 5.8).Making delivery of clinical services more efficientThere are many routes by which developing coun-tries can improve the efficiency of clinical services.Policies to increase the efficiency of governmenthealth services through decentralization and betterhospital management could have an especiallylarge positive effect, as could policies for strength-ening government regulation of a more competi-tive private sector.DECENTRALIZATION. A policy that can improveboth efficiency and responsiveness to local needsis decentralization of the planning and manage-ment of government health services. In Africasome central ministries of health have given pro-vincial and district offices responsibility for plan-ning, day-to-day management of funds, person-nel, training, maintenance, and other functions.Many problems have arisen: local governments orlocal offices of the central health ministry have nothad the capacity to plan and manage health activ-ities; devolution of responsibility has not alwaysbeen accompanied by allocation of the neededfunds; and local officials have not necessarily beenaccountable to their constituents. There have beensome successes, however, that offer lessons forother countries.Box 5.8Traditional medical practitioners and the delivery of essential health servicesMany simple health activities do not require extensiveprofessional training or major facilities and equipment.Health workers based in clinics or in their own commu-nities play an important role in delivering these ser-vices. The millions of community-based traditionalhealth practitioners have enormous potential as publichealth workers and providers of essential clinical ser-vices if governments can give them the appropriatetraining, information, and incentives.Thus far, the experience with modern-traditional col-laboration has been mixed. A number of projects havefailed because of poorly designed training and inade-quate supervision, and many governments need to domore to curb unnecessary and dangerous practices bytraditional healers. But there have also been instructivesuccesses.An evaluation of workers participating in a volun-teer program for detection of malaria in northern Thai-land found that the performance of volunteers whowere traditional healers was superior to that of othervolunteers. The program, which began in 1961, had by1988 more than 40,000 malaria-control volunteers dis-tributed across 34,000 Thai villages. Volunteers trainedby the Ministry of Health are expected to examine vil-lagers, take blood samples, prepare smears to be sentto the district malaria clinic for analysis, and treat fever.They also provide malaria-related education to the vil-lagers. In comparison with alternatives such as paidoutreach workers, the volunteers improve case detec-tion and save the government considerable expense.A WHO study found that traditional healer volun-teers in Thailand were more active in pursuing andidentifying malaria cases than other volunteers andthat they tended to remain in the program longer be-cause their service enhanced their standing in the Com-munity. Villagers indicated that they felt more confi-dent about having someone they already knew as thevillage traditional healer draw their blood and adminis-ter treatment.In western Kenya the African Medical and Re-search Foundation (AMREF) has trained male and fe-male traditional health practitioners who live in remotevillages to dispense drugs and some types of contra-ceptives. Since the project began, the share of womenof reproductive age using modern contraception in sixpilot sites has risen from less than 10 percent to morethan 25 percent. The Kenyan government has askedAMREF to expand the project.In Bangladesh a program to train and support mid-wives to work with traditional birth attendants helpedto lower maternal mortality rates by 60 percent over aten-year period. The results of the program indicatethat, given adequate support systems, community-based services could bring about a substantial declinein maternal mortality. In Ghana, until recently, decisions on healthspending were highly centralized, with inflexibleexpenditure levels set by the Ministry of Health forspecific \"vertical\" programs such as immuniza-tion, control of tuberculosis and leprosy, and fam-ily planning. In the late 1980s the ministry agreedto delegate financial authority to health teams ineach of the country's 110 districts. Unfortunately,most district health officials did not know the pro-cedures for obtaining and accounting for funds. Toremedy this problem, members of the districthealth management teams were given trainingthat enabled them to make more timely budgetingand spending decisions, and expenditure levels in-creased as much as fivefold. In districts where ear-marked funds from the center were pooled andreallocated according to local priorities, technicilefficiency improved because of joint planning ofwork schedules and sharing of transport for out-reach services and supervision.In Botswana, although secondary and tertiaryhealth care is the responsibility of the central Min-istry of Health, the government has devolved re-sponsibility for primary care to local district coun-cils. The process began on a pilot basis in 1973 andwas gradually expanded to cover the entire coun-try. To support decentralization, the Ministry ofHealth funded the creation of district health teamsconsisting of a medical officer, a public healthnurse, and a health inspector. The central govern-ment continues to finance, through annual blockgrants, most of the recurrent primary care expen-ditures of the district councils, and the councils'proposals for capital spending are included in theministry's investment budget. But the day-to-daymanagement of primary care centers, includingpurchases of supplies and hiring of personnel, isin the hands of the councils.Those countries that have gone furthest in de-centralization have devolved responsibility forhealth servicesincluding implementation of ofgovernment facilitiesto subriational levelsof government. Such devolution has been goingon for many years in some large developing coun-tries with federal systems of government (for ex- 129ample, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Nigeria), but it isalso becoming increasingly common in a numberof other Latin American countries and in the for-merly socialist economies.The gradual devolution of Chile's health systemover the past decade suggests that success can beachieved through a measured process accom-panied by training and institutional development.Chile began the progressive decentralization of itspublicly provided health services in 1979, whentwenty-six health service areas (HSAs) were estab-lished to cover the country's thirteen administrative regions. Each HSA was given responsibility(and, to go with it, additional personnel and ashare of the health budget) for managing all thegovernment health facilities in its area. The secondstep in decentralization was taken in 1987, whenmanagement of the primary care network (consist-ing of more than 2,500 urban and rural clinics,rural health posts, and rural medical stations aswell as about 14,000 health personnel) was trans-ferred to the local government or municipalities.The HSAs were responsible for monitoring themunicipalities' actions. In a third phase of the de-centralization process, scheduled to begin in late1993, the central Ministry of Health will withdrawcompletely from service provision, leaving thistask entirely to the HSAs, which will enter intoformal performance contracts with the ministry.But not all decentralization has been a success.Countries such as Colombia that have devolvedresponsibility in a short period of time, withoutthe requisite financial resources and institutionalcapacity at lower levels of government, havefound that decentralization can be counterproduc-tive, aggravating existing inefficiencies and ineq-uities in the health system. In Brazil the munici-palityof Rio de Janeirorefusedtoacceptresponsibility for all the \"decentralized\" federalhealth facilities within its borders on the groundsthat federal budget transfers to the municipalitywere inadequate. IMPROVEMENT OF HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT. Lowrates of hospital utilization in developing countriespoint to significant inefficiencies in the use ofbuildings and equipment (to which scarce capitalhas been devoted). Most common medical condi-tions can be treated in relatively simple facilities.In a well-run hospital system district hospitalswould have the highest turnover rates and theshortest stays, while tertiary hospitals would havethe lowest turnover rates and the longest stays.Some countries, including China and Fiji, have ef- 130ficient systems that conform to the expected pat-tern. But in others, such as Indonesia, Jamaica,and Lesotho, there are no significant differencesbetween the different types of hospitals. In PapuaNew Guinea the ideal pattern is reversed: the lowturnover rate for district hospitals implies that thehospitals either have too many beds or offer suchpoor services that patients go directly to higherlevels. The shorter average stay at the tertiary hos-pital suggests that many patients who do not re-quire tertiary care are treated there.Disparities in average length of stay across hos-pitals with a similar mix of cases are another indi-cation of substantial inefficiencies. Data from LatinAmerica for 1980-85 show that average stays inhospitals run by ministries of health varied fromfive days in Colombia to thirteen days in Uruguay,and stays in social insurance hospitals varied fromfive days in Mexico to twelve days in Peru. In pub-lic hospitals in Argentina the average length ofstay ranged from eight to twenty-seven days. InMalawi average stays in six government hospitalswith a similar case mix varied from five to thirteendays.To remedy these inefficiencies, major steps toimprove the organization and management ofpublic hospitalsare required. One approachwould be to delegate responsibility for health ser-vice delivery to individual public institutions, butdoing so will require changes in accounting andmanagement practices. Government health bud-gets are now often highly aggregated, covering allfacilities and programs in a given district, region,or even country. This prevents any detailed analy-sis of spending and services. Tracking costs shouldbecome part of the responsibility of the facilitymanager and the district management team. Costanalysis would make it easy for these managers tomonitor areas of over- or underfunding and forhigher-level officials to compare cost profiles andunit costs.Some countries have converted public hospitalsinto semiautonomous foundations or public enter-prises in order to improve performance by grant-ing greater budgetary and management auton-omy. These foundations or parastatals are underfewer restrictions than public facilities in manag-ing their budgets and sometimes in hiring and fir-ing. They can recover costs and collect charitabledonations. The Tunisian government, for exam-ple, has converted eleven large public hospitalsinto semiautonomous entities over the past twoyears and will convert another ten in the next fewyears. Under the new arrangement, each hospitalmanages its own operational budget and is free toreassign funds across budget categories as needed.To ensure accountability, the hospital is required tooperate within its annual budget and to provide tothe Ministry of Health detailed reports about ser-vices provided and unit costs. Autonomy in per-sonnel matters is more limited. All staff except thegeneral manager are still governed by civil serviceregulations. The hospital management cannot fireemployees, but it can ask the ministry to reabsorbstaff and can use contracted personnel instead.The effect of these reforms will be fully assessedover the next few years, but some gains in effi-ciency are already apparent. One of the first hospi-tals converted has fully contracted out all food,cleaning, and security functions and now obtainsservices of much higher quality, at similar or evenlower unit cost.Elsewhere too, an increasing body of evidencesuggests that the technical efficiency of govern-ment health facilities can be improved by contract-ing out ancillary services. In Venezuela, for exam-ple,HealthMinistryhospitalscontractoutmaintenance of large equipment, and social secu-rity hospitals frequently contract for laundry, gar-dening, food services, and security, as well as formaintenance. This arrangement has several ad-vantages. It can be less costly than publicly pro-vided services; services can be of better quality;and they can be more reliable (because less subjectto strikes and other industrial action). COMPETITIONANDREGULATION. Competitionamong health providers in developing countriescan improve the quality of services as perceived bypatients and thus increase consumer satisfaction.This applies to the poor as well as the rich: compe-tition among private physicians in the slums ofBombay, for example, is intense, with private prac-titioners offering convenient evening hours, shortwaiting times, and readily available drugs to winpatients from other private practitioners and frompublic clinics.It is much less clear, however, whether competi-tion among suppliers of health services alwaysleads to greater efficiency. In fact, the contrarysometimes happens, especially when competitionamong private providers is combined with third-party reimbursement of fees paid for services. Ex-cessive tests, procedures, and drugs are supplied,and costs increase. This supplier-induced ineffi-ciency takes place because most patients are un-able to judge the value of specific services or tocompare prices among suppliersall the more sowhen they are already sick or have a pressinghealth problemand because, in the case of third-party reimbursement, they do not bear the fullcost of the services they consume.Governments can encourage efficiency-pro-moting competition among suppliers of health ser-vices by requiring them to offer a standard pack-age of services ata price fixed in advance.Consumers can then pick the supplier that offersthe most attractive combination of price, service,and quality, with competition spurring suppliersto improve quality and reduce costs. This is thebasic approach taken in \"managed competition\"proposals for health care reform in the UnitedStates (Box 5.9). Although managed competitionrequires a high degree of government administra-tive capacity to set the rules and to monitor pro-vider performance, it may be relevant in somemiddle-income developing countries.As developing countries take steps to encouragea diversified system of health service delivery, in-cluding use of NGOs and private providers, theywill also need to strengthen their governments'capacity to regulate the private sector. Regulationsare required to ensure that quality standards aremet, that financial fraud and other abuses do nottake place, that those entitled to care are not de-nied services, and that confidentiality of medicalinformation is respected. Regulation can be carriedout in a number of ways: by inspecting privatehealth facilities; by accrediting medical schools; bylicensing physicians, nurses, and other health pro-fessionals; and by prohibiting certain insurancepractices such as exclusion of prior medical condi-tions. When the government allocates funds toNGOs, reimburses private providers under publicinsurance schemes, or subcontracts with the pri-vate sector for ancillary services such as cateringand laundry, it can require an independent auditof these private contractors.In practice, few developing countries have es-tablished such regulatory mechanisms, but the sit-uation may be changing. In Brazil, where socialinsurance finances the bulk of health care, and pri-vate hospitals and physicians provide 80 percentof hospital services and half of all outpatient care,important regulatory changes are now under dis-cussion. These include comprehensive accredita-tion of facilities by state governments, standardlicensing examinations for medical school gradu-ates, and the inclusion of representatives of citi-zens' groups and consumer advocacy organiza-tions in medical ethics boards, which are currentlycomposed exclusively of physicians. The private 131Box 5.9\"Managed competition\" and health care reform in the United States'Managed competition,\" which has attracted wide-spread interest in the United States, refers to a healthservices purchasing strategy designed to promote com-petition and to reward those health care providers withthe best performance in terms of cost, quality, and pa-tient satisfaction. The strategy is designed to addressthe fundamental problems of the current health carefinancing and delivery system in the United States.There, health care coverage is mainly employment-based and is far from universal: approximately 37 mil-lion people under age 65 lacked insurance coverage in1990. Costs are increasing rapidly; if current trendscontinue, spending is expected to grow from 12 to 18percent of GNP by 2000. Under third-party insurance,provider reimbursement methods often create financialincentives to provide more care. Insurers seek profitsby excluding higher-risk individuals rather than by ag-gressively pursuing greater efficiency in providinghealth services. A major indirect cost of the system isreduced labor mobility as a result of the risks of exclu-sion from insurance at a new place of employment.Under managed competition, a health insurancepurchasing cooperative (HIPC) would be formed to or-ganize purchasers of health care within a region. TheHIPC would establish standards for the region's healthplan by, for example, defining a basic benefit packageof comprehensive health services, and would contractwith eligible providers for this basic package. Duringthe annual open-enrollment period the HIPC wouldprovide information about the price of the basic pack-age from different providers and about the quality ofcare offered. Equity would be improved by requiringproviders to open their rolls to all consumers, regard-less of risk. Universal coverage would be achievedthrough public subsidies to those not otherwise cov-ered so that they could purchase packages. Standardi-zation would enable consumers to choose among com-peting packages in an informed and more price-conscious way. One example of \"managed competi-tion\" is the California Public Employees RetirementSystem, which operates like the proposed HIPC, ar-ranging health coverage and managing competition onbehalf of almost I million state employees and retireesand their families.Analysts expect that over time competition wouldforce third_party insurers to drop out or move in thedirection of managed care networks because these net-works can use financial incentives and managementtools to achieve efficient care. Indeed, insurers are al-ready shifting in this direction: nearly half of all healthinsurers now offer some sort of plan involving man-aged care. Competition would also give health careproviders clear incentives to become more efficient.One question about the managed competition model iswhether it would work in rural areas and areas of lowpopulation density,and,ifnot, what alternativeswould be best. Another concern is the cost of extend-ing universal coverage.Although this proposal was developed to respond tothe particular problems of the U.S. system, it has rele-vance elsewhere. The Netherlands, which is introduc-ing choice of insurer under a universal social healthinsurance scheme, faces the same challenges regardingcontrol of risk-selection behavior on the part of in-surers. Chile has, since 1981, encouraged the growth ofprivate prepaid health insurance schemes, known asISAPREs. (Box 7.2 provides details on these plans.)Problems have come up with Chile's reforms, how-ever: the lack of a standard package has limited effec-tive competition, and weak regulation has allowed pri-vate insurers to deny coverage to high-risk individuals. Brazilian Association of Hospitals is debating theestablishment of its own accreditation system, andthe medical association in S\u00e3o Paulo has begun avoluntary pilot effort to certify hospitals in thatstate on the basis of adherence to norms, assess-ment of patient data, and patient satisfaction sur-veys. Qualifying examinations for licensing physi-cians are being tested in another state where, atpresent, all medical school graduates are automaf-ically licensed for life, without requirements forcontinuing education or recertification. And theFederal Council of Medicine has proposed legisla-tion that would expand its authority to monitor thequality of health care and to discipline poorly per-forming doctors and hospitals. 132Reorienting clinical services and beyondIt is a fundamental responsibility of governmentseverywhere to ensure access to a package of essen-tial clinical health care, with special attention tothe poor. Utilization of a minimum package de-fined by its high cost-effectiveness would reducethe total burden of illness in developing countriesdramatically, by an average of 25 percent. Such apackage is affordable in low-income countries ifgovernments reallocate current health expendi-tures and increase public spending and if they im-plement policies that encourage selective pay-ments directly from better-off patients and fromexisting insurance schemes. Middle-income coun-tries could easily pay for the minimum package,using the resources currently devoted to health,and might wish to enrich the package by addingservices.Government efforts to improve health insuranceshould be aimed at increasing the portion of thepopulation covered, reducing subsidies for insur-ance that benefit primarily the wealthy and themiddle class, and controlling health care spendingfinanced from insurance. This will require strongerregulation of private insurance and policies to ex-pand compulsory social insurance based on pay-roll taxes. It also means shifting provider paymentaway from open-ended fee-for-service methods toprepayment through capitation and preset bud-gets for hospitals.Greater diversity and competition in the supplyof health services can do much to improve the de-livery of an essential clinical package and raise thetechnical efficiency of doctors, hospitals, and otherproviders. Key government measures includestrengthening legaland financial support toNGOs that provide health services and creating apositive environment for the private sector com-binedwithimportantregulatorysafeguardsagainst abuse. Gains in technical efficiency can beachieved through a combination of careful decen-tralization of government health services and im-proved management of public hospitals.These efforts to reorient government recurrentspending toward essential clinical care and to pro-mqte diversity and competition in the supply ofhealth services must be accompanied by changesin longer-term investments in health inputsfacil-ities and equipment, health personnel, phar-maceutical management systems, health informa-tion, and health research infrastructure. Policies tobring about this reorientation are taken up inChapter 6. 133Health inputs In recent decades developing countries have in-vested heavily in health. Often with help from do-nors, they have constructed hospitals and build-ings and purchased equipment to fill them. Theyhave educated doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. And they have set up new sys-tems to supply drugs, research, and information.Worldwide, the number of hospital beds rose be-tween 1960 and 1980 from 5 million to almost 17million, which more than doubled the per capitasupply. The number of physicians increased morethan fivefold between 1955 and 1990, from 1.2 mil-lion to 6.2 million. Such investments have creatednew opportunities, but they have also led toproblems.Once built, hospitals are extremely difficult toclose. Once trained, physicians create pressure tobe employed. In virtually every developing coun-try, facilities, equipment, human resources, anddrugs are skewed toward the top of the healthsystem pyramid (Figure 6.1). Yet the cost-effectivepublic health and clinical interventions discussedin preceding chapters of this Report are best deliv-ered at the level of the district hospital or below.That they are often delivered through tertiary hos-pitals simply increases costs without improvingquality. This problem is found in poor countries inwhich the principal tertiary teaching hospital inthe capital city consumes a large proportion of thetotal resources available for health. It is also foundin cities such as London, where numerous spe-cialized teaching hospitals absorb large amountsof resources while failing to address the mostcommon and pressing health problems of cityresidents.In many countries public investments are con-centrated unduly on tertiary services, and public 134spending subsidizes high-end facilities, equip-ment, and human resources for private markets.The challenge for public policy is to redress thebalance and so permit the efficient delivery of pub-lic health and essential clinical services. Wherecost containment of health spending is a concern,public policy can play a useful role in limiting thegrowth of both public and private investments inspecialist training, equipment, and tertiary facili-ties. For some inputs, such as buildings and hu-man resources, changes will necessarily be slow.For others, such as pharmaceuticals, a new policycan alter inputs rapidly. This chapter suggests howto set about these tasks. It also assesses how publicsupport for information and research can helpimprove health sector performance today andcreate new health systems and technologies fortomorrow.Reallocating investments in facilitiesand equipmentInvestments to support delivery of essential clini-cal services are best directed at health centers anddistrict hospitals and at improving access in under-served areas. Some public investments in tertiaryfacilities are needed to support research and train-ing, but at levels well below current levels of pub-lic financing in most countries. Investments in spe-cialized facilities can be left largely to the privatesector, and public subsidies, where they exist, canoften be greatly reduced.Redirecting publicspending toward lower-level facilities is difficultpolitically, but some countries are moving in thisdirection. In Papua New Guinea, for example,public spending on hospitals has for the past dec-ade been limited to 40 percent of the Ministry ofMost health care should.take place toward the bottomof this pyramid. Figure 6.1 The health system pyramid:where care is provided ASpecializedhospitals Districthospitals Health centersand clinics HouseholdsDistricthealthsystemA Health's recurrent budget, which is well below theaverage in most developing countries. FacilitiesTertiary hospitals provide the most specialized andsophisticated services and are where most clinicalresearch, education, and training take place. Theyare usually located in large urban areas. One stepdown the health hierarchy are district hospitals,which are typically located in towns or smallercities serving rural areas but are valuable in largecities too. District hospitals generally have 100 to400 beds, serve 50,000 to 200,000 inhabitants, andinclude departments of medicine, surgery, pedi-atrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and dentistry.They also provide basic anesthesia, radiology, andclinical laboratory services. The district hospital isthe first level of referral from health centers andprovides complementary services such as basicsurgery. It mainly offers inpatient care but alsotypically provides some outpatient care, day sur-gery (in which the patient is operated on and dis-charged on the same day), and emergency servicesnot available at health centers. In many cities thathave grown rapidly over the past twenty years,periurban areas do not have enough health centersand district hospitals. In some African capitals oneextremely large tertiary public hospital serves thewhole cityan example is Zambia's UniversityTeaching Hospital of Lusaka, with 1,835 beds.Hospitals absorb the bulk-40 to 80 percentofpublic spending on health in developing coun-tries. Industrial countries have much higher healthexpenditures and more chronic disease problems,but the share allocated to hospitals is slightlysmaller, 35 to 70 percent. Figure 6.2 shows themarked variations in hospital supply across theeight demographic regions used in this Report,from about eleven beds per 1,000 population inCentral and Eastern Europe to less than one bedper 1,000 population in India. In most developingcountries more than 60 percent of all hospital bedsare public. The data used in Figure 6.2 unfor-tunately fail to distinguish between tertiary anddistrict-level hospitals. The minimum package ofessential clinical services described in Chapter 5requires about one district hospital bed per 1,000population. Given that some of India's and Sub-Saharan Africa's hospital beds are devoted to careoutside the essential package, there is likely to be ashortage of district-level hospital beds in parts ofthose regions.In some countries the underfunding of lower-level facilities has been exacerbated by the creationof multiple levels of outpatient facilities (healthposts, dispensaries, and rural health centers),none of which functions well. At the same time,tertiary care hospitals are crowded with patientswho could be treated in less costly and more acces-sible district hospitals or health centers. A study inChad, for example, revealed that 71 percent of allcentral hospital consultations were for problemsthat could have been treated at lower-level facili-ties. An obvious way to reduce spending withoutsacrificing any health gains is to make full use ofexisting lower-level facilities. Measures for achiev-ing this include charging a higher fee to patientswho go straight to tertiary facilities without refer-rals, except in emergencies, and making a referralfrom the primary care provider a mandatory con-dition for specialized services. At the same time,however, the quality and responsiveness of ser-vices at lower-level facilities need to be improved. INCENTIVES AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS. Publicsector budgetary procedures often obscure the realcosts of investments in health facilities and biasthem toward high-profile investments in largehospitals. Major investments, including donor-financed projects, may be approved by a govern-ment body that does not have to face the recurrentcosts of operating the facility. Regions can argue 135Installed hospital ca pacify is lowest in India, Sub-Saha ran Africa, and Asia and highest in the formerly socialisteconomies of Europe. Figure 6.2 Hospital capacity by demographic region, about 1990 Beds per 1,000 population024681012Sub-Saharan AfricaIndiaChinaOther Asia and islandsLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle Eastern crescentFormerly socialist economies of EuropeEstablished market economies Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data; World Health Organization data. for new facilities without having to weigh the bud-getary consequencesiffederal-stateresourcetransfers, instead of following predictable andtransparent funding formulas (such as population-based schemes), are heavily politicized.International assistance has frequently exacer-bated the problem of unsustainable health invest-ments. Donor assistance, particularly for tertiaryfacilities and teaching hospitals, has sometimesbeen provided even if the incremental recurrentcosts from these investments are too high. Toomany donor-financed hospitals have opened onlypartially, not at all, or at the expense of existingfacilities. In Rwanda, for example, a 200-bed hos-pital was completed in 1991 but has not yet openedbecause of the difficulty of financing its high recur-rent costs, which are estimated at about 15 percentof the Ministry of Health's already tightly con-strained budget. In Chad, where external assis-tance amounts to about 30 percent of national in-come, a national development plan proved usefulfor screening out inappropriate donor financing.Two new hospital construction proposals thatwere found to conflict with the plan are beingreconsidered.In the private sector, financial incentives driveinvestment decisions. Health maintenance organi- 136zations (HMOs) in the United States have incen-tives for providing care efficiently. As a result,they operate with much less hospital infrastruc-ture than the health system overall. Large HMOs(with hospitals) have about 1.5 hospital beds per1,000 memberswell below the average of 8 bedsper 1,000 for established market economies and 5for the United States overall and slightly belowregional averages for China and Latin America.Evidence indicates that quality of care in HMOs ismaintained even with significantly lower levels ofhospitalization and hospital infrastructure. Pri-vately financed health insurance with uncon-strained fee-for-service payment, by contrast, pro-vides no incentives to rationalize physical capacity. DUPLICATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN THE PUBLICSECTOR. Excess public facilities in urban areas are aproblem in many countries. The historical growthof hospitals, especially in capital cities, has led to aproliferation of specialist tertiary services that areoften linked to medical education and research.Another cause of duplication is the public provi-sion of health services to different subgroups ofthe population, each with its own hospitals andhealth centers. In Poland, for example, parallelhealth systems exist for workers and their familiesin the railway, mining, police, and military sectorsand for prisoners; another set of facilities servesthe general population. This can result in excesscapacity, with no facilities achieving economies ofscale.There are two solutions for duplication: creatinginternal markets and instituting central or regionalplanning linked to health budgets. If effective in-ternal markets are created within the public sector,money will follow patientsand patients, togetherwith their general practitioners, will have a choiceas to which hospital to use. The availability ofgood information about quality and price will helpefficient providers of specialist services to prosper,while less-efficient hospitals will close. The alter-native is rationalization of services by central orregional planning. In the largely publicly financedhealth systems of the Nordic countries, health re-sources are allocated by region. Each region ofabout 350,000 inhabitants elects representativeswho make decisions about health care spending.These representatives have incentives to avoid du-plication of services and to capture economies ofscale in service delivery. If left to individual hospi-tals, decisionmaking for large investments willtend to reflect the interests of that hospital, not theregion. Multiple hospitals will want to providespecialized,\"prestige\"services,leadingtooverinvestment.EQuITY CONSIDERATIONS. For the rural poor, lackof physical infrastructure is the largest obstacle touse of health services. Distance to health facilitieslimits people's willingness and ability to seek care,particularly when transport is limited. There is aheavy urban bias in the distribution of health facili-ties. Large cities are much better served by bothpublic and private health infrastructure thanwould be expected from their roles of serving ur-ban populations and providing referral services forthe surrounding population. (Referral hospitalsare needed for only a small proportionno morethan 10 percentof total hospitalizations.) Wealth-ier regions also have better access to infrastruc-ture. In India the richer states of Maharashtra andGujarat have 1.5 and 1.1 beds, respectively, per1,000 population; the poorer states of Bihar andMadhya Pradesh have only 0.3 and 0.4 bed, re-spectively, per 1,000 population. Public invest-ments need to address inequities in the presentdistribution of health infrastructure. Donors havean important role in this regard, especially where asignificant proportion of investment is donorfinanced.PRODUCTIVITY. The potential for improving theproductivity of installed hospital capacity is large.In addition to the financing and management re-forms discussed in Chapter 5, efficiency gains canbe achieved by taking the following measures,which will need to be supported by investments intraining and infrastructure:Convert some acute care hospital capacity toless costly extended or chronic care facilities forpatients who require less-intensive care for long-term recovery and for rehabilitation of chronicconditions. Extended care facilities operate at alower cost per bed-day than acute care hospitals.In the absence of such lower-level facilities, pa-tients occupy high-cost acute care beds.Perform outpatient diagnostic tests before ad-mitting the patient to the hospital.Support home care as an alternative to long-term hospitalization for some ailments.Modify treatment protocolsfor example, re-duce unnecessary surgeries, perform low-risk de-liveries at maternity centers, and treat tuberculosispatients and many surgical cases on an outpatientbasis. In Cali, Colombia, costs per procedure forday surgery are less than 30 percent of the costof traditional treatment in hospital. Outpatientsurgery has grown rapidly in many industrialcountries but is used much less in developingcountries. MAKING THE TRANSITION. The 1985 earthquakein Mexico City destroyed about 20 percent of pub-lic hospital capacity. The Ministry of Health choseto concentrate reconstruction and new construc-tion in low-income periurban areas that had hith-erto been poorly served, and six new 144-bed dis-trict hospitals were built in these areas. But suchpossibilities for rapidly reconfiguring capacity to-ward lower-level facilities and underserved areasare seldom available. The alternative is to reduceor refrain from public investment in tertiary hospi-tals while simultaneously increasing investmentand operating budgets for health centers and dis-trict hospitals. Over time, the tertiary hospitals canbe operated on a self-financing basis, or they canbe closed, converted to chronic care facilities ordistrict hospitals if these are needed, or even soldto the private sector. But in most countries thisprocess will necessarily be slow.EquipmentDeveloping countries account for about $5 billion,or 7 percent, of the $71 billion spent each year on 137medical equipment worldwide. This global esti-mate includes medical and dental supplies, surgi-cal instruments, electromedical and X-ray equip-ment, diagnostic tools, and implanted products.The ability of the medical equipment industry todevelop new health care technologies has vastlyexceeded the capacity of purchasers to evaluatethe clinical value and the cost-effectiveness of suchinnovations. At present, approximately 6,000 dis-tinct types of medical devices (equipment, sup-plies,and reagents) and more than 750,000brands, models, and sizes, produced by perhaps12,000 manufacturers worldwide, are on themarket.Efficiency losses from poor selection and main-tenance of medical equipment can be very large.WHO estimates that less than half of all medicalequipment in developing countries is usable. InBrazil an estimated 20 to 40 percent of the $2 billionto $3 billion worth of public sector medical equip-ment is not working. A study of twelve Kenyanhospitals in 1984 found that sterilizers operated foran average of two years instead of the six expectedand that incubators lasted only two years ratherthan eight. Equipment failed prematurely becausemaintenance budgets were only about 1 percent ofthe value of the capital stock (10 percent might beconsidered optimal). In Viet Nam 39 percent ofurban health centers and 29 percent of urban poly-clinics surveyed in 1991 lacked a working ster-ilizera critical piece of equipment for developingcountries that have to reuse such supplies assyringes.Investments in medical equipment can be ratio-nalized by controlling the purchase of expensive,sophisticated equipment and rejecting most do-nated medical equipment, new or used. To containcosts, Belgium, France, and Portugal directly con-trol the acquisition of state-of-the-art medical tech-nologies by both the public and the private sectors.In Canada major capital acquisitions require priorapproval by the provincial or territorial ministry ofhealth on the basis of a needs assessment andother factors. Alternatively, governments can en-courage public hospitals to make tough choices bylimiting their budgets. Even assuming that do-nated equipment meets local equipment require-.ments, very little of it ever becomes operational,for a variety of reasons, including missing or dam-aged parts, lack of disposable inputs and of userand service manuals, and problems with powersupply. Standardization of equipment could sim-plify management and maintenance and reduceinventory costs. Purchasing decisions could be an-alyzed on a life-cycle cost basis. In many cases im-138proving maintenance to increase operating life andreduce downtime of equipment is more efficientthan buying new equipment.Because of the many products on the marketand the speed of change, carrying out technologyassessments can be extremely costly. The interna-tional community could help by developing anddisseminating information on the availability, ef-fectiveness, and prices of equipment and on userguidelines. Essential equipment lists could be de-veloped along the lines of the essential drug listsalready used by many countries.Equipment procurement would also benefitfrom greater use of competitive buying. Purchas-ing is commonly restricted to local distributor-ships, and some countries also heavily protect lo-cal industry. These policies reduce competitionand can easily double the purchase price of equip-ment. Developing countries can cut costs byadopting competitive purchasing methods or bypurchasing equipment from international agen-ciessuch as UNICEF, Equipment for CharityHospitals Overseas (ECHO), and the InternationalDispensary Associationthat offer procurementservices for some medical equipment at competi-tive prices.There are several reasons for government in-volvement in the development of health infra-structure. The government itself, as a provider ofhealth services, may finance and use infrastruc-ture. It may also intervene to compensate for mar-ket failures that can lead to greater investment,particularly in specialized health inputs, than issocially optimal. Finally, the government has a rolein undertaking technology assessment of medicalequipment, which is a costly public good.To reduce both capital and recurrent costs with-out sacrificing quality of care, governments can:Reallocate public spending toward the facili-ties and equipment required for providing publichealth programs and essential clinical services.Improve the efficiency of installed capacity byconsidering alternative uses of facilities, as well asnew diagnostic and treatment protocols. (Exam-ples are the conversion of some costly acute carecapacity to less costly extended care beds andtreatment of some surgeries on an outpatientbasis.) Such reconfiguration may require modestnew investment.When cost containment is a concern, considercontrols on the purchase of expensive, specializedtechnologies, whether by public or by privateproviders.Support and disseminate technology assess-ments to purchasers.Reduce or eliminate subsidies to private in-vestors in facilities and equipment.Addressing imbalances in humanresourcesNearly all countries face the same fundamentalproblems with human resources in the health sec-tor. There are not enough primary care providersand too many specialists. Health workers are con-centrated in urban areas. Training in public health,health policy, and health management has beenrelatively neglected. Medical training is subsidizedeven though physicians may earn high incomesand many work in the private sector.There are several ways in which governmentscan do something about these problems. Publicsector pay and employment policies can be im-proved to be more competitive with the privatesector and to relate pay to performance. Careerdevelopment paths and in-service training areneeded to retain staff, especially in managerial po-sitions. Policies on accreditation and licensing canbe used to limit enrollments in training programs,to shape curricula (all physicians might spend timein rural practice during their medical training or berequired to pass examinations in public health),and to set minimum standards for providers. Edu-cation finance policies can be used to curtail educa-tion opportunities for physicians and specialistsand to expand them for workers in primary care,public health, health policy, and management. Butwhere oversupply is greatest, as for specialist phy-sicians, the only effective solution may be to setquotas for training, or at the very least for publiclysubsidized training. Improving the balance between primary care providersand specialistsA central role in delivery of most cost-effectivehealth interventions belongs to primary care pro-viders, a category that can include physicians,nurses, nurse practitioners, or midwives, depend-ing upon how the jobs are defined. Nonphysicianprimary care providers have many advantages.They cost less to train (data from Myanmar,Pakistan, and Sri Lanka indicate that between 2.5and 3 nurses can be trained for the cost of trainingone physician), and they receive lower salaries.They are easier to attract to rural areas and usuallycommunicate more effectively with their patients.In Sub-Saharan Africa, where the few local physi-cians are concentrated in urban hospitals, nursesoften function as primary care providers. China,too, has long relied on graduates of three-year (in-stead of five-year) medical schools to meet theneeds of rural areas.In some countries tasks traditionally performedby physicians have been successfully delegated tolower-level primary care providers as a way of im-proving the efficiency of health services. By spe-cializing in certain common procedures (as mid-wives specialize in deliveries, for example), suchproviders may become better at their tasks than ageneralistphysician.SurgicaltechniciansinMozambique perform hysterectomies and ce-sarean sections and remove ectopic pregnancies.Some nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) inBangladesh use graduate nurses to do steriliza-tions, and in Thailand public sector nurse-mid-wives perform this procedure. In these cases, eval-uationsindicate no differences inoutcomescompared with procedures done by physicians.Ophthalmic clinical officers, who are not physi-cians, have performed cataract surgery in Kenyaon a pilot basis, and evaluations indicate accept-able results. Africa has only one ophthalmologistper 1 million people; without the use of nonphysi-cian services, many patients would not be able toget cataract surgery.The distribution of nurses and physicians by re-gion is shown in Figure 6.3. Appropriate staffingratios depend heavily on the organization and f i-nancing of care and the specific tasks health per-sonnel carry out. Health maintenance organiza-tions in the United States, for example, operatewith about 1.2 physicians per 1,000 enrollees, com-pared with about 4.5 in the fee-for-service sector.Evaluations of health outcomes and user satisfac-tion indicate that these savings in resources do notcome at the expense of quality. Sub-Saharan Africahas the fewest physicians and nurses of any re-gion, which is an obstacle to the delivery of thepublic health interventions and essential clinicalservices described in Chapters 4 and 5 becausesome of the existing personnel are providing otherservices. The public health and minimum essentialclinical interventions require about 0.1 physicianper 1,000 population and between 2 and 4 gradu-ate nurses per physician. Given resource con-straints, however, the relatively high ratio ofnurses to physicians in Sub-Saharan Africa is agood sign. There is no optimal level of physiciansper capita or optimal nurse-to-physician ratio, buta rule of thumb is that nurses should exceed physi-cians by at least two to one. (The ratio is five to onein Africa but well under two to one in China,India, Latin America, and the Middle Easterncrescent.)139The availability and mix of health personnel vary widely across regions.

During the 1960s and1970s many governments encouraged, primarilythrough subsidies to education, rapid expansion inphysician training to meet the need for primarycare providers. In many countries the excess ofphysicians in relation to nurses and of specialistsin relation to other physicians has created prob-lems. By the early 1980s the established marketeconomies, Latin America, and parts of Asia werehaving trouble absorbing growing numbers ofphysicians. These policies have been costly, and itwill take many years to correct the imbalances.Mexico illustrates the problems. Medical enroll-ments in 1970 stood at about 29,000 in twenty-seven schools. Within ten years there were 93,000in fifty-six schools. Many of the schools offeredhighly subsidized or free tuition, and some of thelargest had open enrollment policies. At the sametime, health services were growing only modestly.In 1960 there were 20,600 physicians in Mexico; by1990 there were 166,000. A survey of physicians inmajor cities in 1986 revealed that 7 percent wereunemployed, another 11 percent were working in140nonmedical jobs, and 11 percent were in low-income medical jobs or were seeing very few pa-tientswhich is a concern because the physiciansmay not see enough patients to maintain theircompetence. The quality of medical education alsodeclined with the rapid growth in medical schools.Furthermore, the expansion of medical trainingdid nothing to solve the problem of attracting phy-sicians to rural areas. In 1983 an interinstitutionalbody was created, with representatives from theministries of health and education, health care in-stitutions, and universities. This group has, byagreement, reduced enrollments and containedthe number of medical schools. More recently, thegovernment has begun publishing average exam-ination scores of medical school graduates byschool to provide information on educational qual-ity for prospective students and employers.Other countries responded to physician over-supply by restricting medical immigration (Canadaand the United Kingdom), by reducing workinghours (Denmark), and by indirectly promotingoutmigration of medical personnel. The last twoBox 6.1International migration and the global market for health professionalsOver the past several decades, large numbers of physi-cians and nurses have migrated across national bor-ders. WHO estimates that 14,000 nurses did so in theearly 1970s and that in 1972 more than 140,000 physi-cians (or 6 percent of the total) resided outside thecountries in which they were born or had been trained.Over the past half century the main flow of physiciansand nurses has been from developing to industrialcountries. Developing countries donate a full 56 per-cent of all migrating physicians and receive less than 11percent. The principal donating countries for physi-cians are India and the Philippines. More than 90 per-cent of the nurses who migrate go to North America,Europe, and the high-income countries of the westernPacific, while only about 7 percent go to developingcountries. Migrating nurses come overwhelminglyfrom the Philippines, which exports each year 2,000 to3,000 nurses, many of whom go to North America. In1970 more Filipino nurses were registered in Canadaand the United States than in the Philippines, and thetrend has continued to the present. Other major coun-tries of origin for migrating nurses are Australia, Can-ada, the United Kingdom, and certain West Indiancountries.Consequences LThe migration of health professionals has both positiveand negative effects. It can help alleviate shortages inthe receiving countries, and large remittances or taxrevenues from overseas workers can improve the stan-dard of living in the countries of origin. (The Philip-pines received an estimated $680 million from expatri-ate workers in all fields in 1986, and an estimated $8billion in remittances went to developing countries as agroup in 1975.) On the negative side, the net outflow oftrained human resources can cause shortages of healthworkers. In Jamaica vacancy rates of more than 50 per-cent in nursing positions, in large part because of mas-sive migration of nurses, have forced the Ministry ofHealth to close whole wards and to reduce the servicesoffered in many facilities.In addition, emigratinghealth workers deprive their own countries of thebenefits of (often state-financed) investments in theireducation. For example, the 111 registered nurses whoresigned from government service in Jamaica in 1990took with them nearly $1.7 million in government in-vestment in training and education.Policy responsesIn an attempt to alter the patterns of migration, manycountries have changed their immigration and licens-ing laws and regulations. During the 1980s, for exam-ple, the United States, to address its own nursingshortage, changed its policy on immigration of nurses,making it relatively easy for nurses wishing to come tothe United States to obtain a visa. This had a profoundeffect on a number of neighboring countries. In thePhilippines during the same period it became increas-ingly difficult for registered nurses to obtain travel doc-uments because of the enormous outflow of nursesfrom that country.Short-term immigration restrictions, however, mayhave only a limited effect. Other possibilities for en-couraging health professionals to remain in their homecountries include reforming education finance to re-quire that individuals repay some or all of the costs ofstate-financed training, through student loans or en-forced service bond requirements. And publicly fi-nanced opportunities for overseas training could be re-stricted because of its tendency to lead to outmigration. solutions waste valuable resources (see Box 6.1). Insome countries the government can limit enroll-ments in medical schools directly. Egypt has re-duced medical enrollments by half since 1982; inFrance the Ministry of Health used quotas to cutnew enrollments from about 11,000 in 1975 to lessthan 5,000 in 1989. In other countries, such as Ger-many and Mexico, universities have autonomy indetermining enrollments, and cuts must be madethrough consensus or through education financepolicies. CURTAILING SPECIALIST TRAINING. Most govern-ments will need to limit not only total enrollmentsbut also the training of medical specialists. Highnumbers of specialists tend to increase the fre-quency of unnecessary and often risky pro-cedures. This, in turn, pushes up health care costsand reduces the quality of care. The United Stateshas the highest number of cardiologists and car-diac operating suites per capita in the world andcorrespondingly higher rates of surgerya signifi-cant proportion of which is inappropriate.While practice guidelines and incentive struc-tures can be important policy tools for curbingoveruse of procedures, training fewer cardiologistswould also help. A classic U.S. study showed thata 10 percent increase in surgeons would bringabout a 3 to 4 percent increase in surgical opera-tionsthe phenomenon of \"supplier-induceddemand.\"Even when specialists function as generalists,they have more costly styles of practice, orderingmore tests and procedures. Analysis of geographic141variation in expenditures in the United States indi-cates that expenditures on physician services areunrelated to the total number of physicians percapita but are related to the ratio of primary carephysicians to specialists. Many OECD countrieslimit the number of specialist training oppor-tunities. This policy instrument is increasinglyrelevant for middle-income countries interested incost containment. Subsidized medical educationhas already led to overproduction in some middle-income developing countries such as Chile, where75 percent of all physicians are specialists, andVenezuela, where about 55 percent of all physi-cians employed in the public sector are specialistsIn contrast, only 25 to 50 percent of physicians inBelgium, France, Germany, and the Scandinaviancountries are specialists, and regulatory bodiesand committees determine the number to betrained.Few, if any, specialists are needed to deliver thecost-effective clinical interventions discussed inChapter 5, even with a modest expansion in con-tent beyond the minimum essential package.Some specialists are required for services outsidethe essential package. The overall proportion ofphysician generalists to specialists is an importantindicator for governments to monitor, but this in-formation is not at present readily available inmany countries. A reasonable benchmark for themaximum proportion of specialists to physiciansin developing countries might be 25 percent,which is about the lowest proportion found in theestablished market economies. In many develop-ing countries the proportion could be much lower,given the epidemiological characteristics of thepopulation and the smaller share of the populationusing clinical services beyond the essential pack-age. Public regulation and rationing of specialisttraining, in addition to the elimination of trainingsubsidies, may be needed to achieve this.CONTENT OF TRAINING. Primary care trainingshould include, at a minimum, the skills necessaryto provide the essential clinical services discussedin Chapter 5. In fact, however, basic curricula inmedical schools often fail adequately to coversome of these services, such as family planningservices and the proper diagnosis and treatment ofsexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For morethan two decades there have been calls to stoptraining health professionals in high-technologytertiary institutions and to expose them thor-oughly to health problems and practice at thegrass-roots level. But progress has been extremely 142slow. The fifty-five member institutions of the in-ternational Network of Community-Oriented Edu-cational Institutions for Health Sciences haveadopted curriculum reforms that emphasize com-munity-based and problem-based learning. Thegoal is to produce graduates whose competenciesand experience correspond closely to communityhealth needs. Significantly larger proportions ofgraduates from these schools have followed ca-reers in primary care, Similar reform efforts havetaken place in nursing education. In Nigeria, Sene-gal, and Uganda (for basic nurse training) and inThailand (for public health nurse practitioners) thenursing curriculum has been oriented more to-ward community settings and preventive services. Attracting primary care providers to underserved areasHealth providers are concentrated in urban areas.Professional isolation, lack of additional work op-portunities, substandard housing, and other dis-amenities often make staffing rural health facilitiesdifficult.If public sector wages cannot be in-creased, other methods must be found to increasethe attractiveness of rural posts. Many countriesrequire a period of rural service following publiclyfinanced medical training. Canadian provinceshave used many incentives, including differentialpay scales, settlement allowances, payment of ex-penses for continuing education, and provision ofscholarships for later study in return for a certainnumber of years of service.In some settings lack of female health providersis an obstacle to utilization of health services. InEgypt, for example, most physicians are male, butcultural beliefs constrain women from being seenafter puberty by men who are not family mem-bers. Even when trained, female primary care pro-viders are hard to attract to underserved areas be-cause of security concerns and the importance ofliving with their families. The Aga Khan Develop-ment Network in Pakistan, recognizing this prob-lem, has trained women to work in their own com-munities as lady health visitors.Community health workers can complement thework of primary care providers in rural areas.Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Ghana, and othercountries have trained large numbers of commu-nity health workers as part of the national strategyfor primary health care; in many other settingsmuch smaller programs have been set up by NGOgroups. Evaluations sometimes show disappoint-ing results: community health workers have oftenhad little impact on health service utilization andBox 6.2Community health workersOver the past twenty years many countries have exper-imented with the use of community health workers(CHWs) to provide primary health care. Several Afri-can countries introduced CHW programs in the 1970sas a way of extending primary health care services atlow cost nationwide. Health workers' responsibilitiestypically include providing education on sanitation,nutrition, family planning, child health, and immuni-zations, in addition to carrying out some basic healthinterventions. They can also be valuable as a referralpoint between health centers and the community. Re-grettably, CHW programs have had mixed results.Studies have shown that in the Gambia and Indonesiatraditional birth attendants who were not backed up byskilled services were unable to decrease the risk of ma-ternal mortality.A Jamaican program, launched in 1977, that usedCHWs in primary health care efforts is an example of awell-intentioned effort gone awry. Problems emergedfrom the beginning, with the selection of personnel.CHWs generally demonstrate greater dedication whenthey serve the communities in which they live. Unfor-tunately, too few CHWs were recruited from the targetcommunities, and workers who lived elsewhere had tobe enlisted. Inability to recruit male volunteers limitedthe success of family planning and STD-preventionprograms. The CHWsa large groupsought and ob-tained civil service benefits, including a set salary struc-ture and promotional opportunities. In 1985 salaries forbriefly trained CHWs were to be equivalent to two-thirds those of registered nurses with three years'training. Health center buildings were altered to serveas bases for CHW operations. Shortages of higher-levelstaff prompted many health centers to substituteCHWs for nurses, even though the workers lacked thenecessary training. CHWs became increasingly linkedto the health system, but their availability to the com-munity diminished. The program has since beengreatly reduced.Other efforts have been more successful. Perhapsthe largest scale NGO-run community health workerprogram is the Pastoral da Crianca, operated by theCatholic Church in Brazil. This program, initiated in1983, receives strong support from the Ministry ofHealth and some technical and financial support fromUNICEF and from the Bernard Van Leer Foundationand other NGOs. It now has 47,000 CHWs throughoutBrazil. An estimated 1.5 million children were enrolledin the program in 1992. CHWs provide health educa-tion to low-income mothers regarding the importanceof prenatal care, good diet during pregnancy, breast-feeding, proper weaning, immunizations, and man-agement of diarrhea, and they monitor the growth ofinfants and young children. The training process forCHWs follows a central guideline but is adapted to fitthe characteristics of different regions. Special care isgiven to the training programs for illiterate volunteers,and supervision of CHWs is closely integrated withcontinuing education and motivational support. Anevaluation carried out in 1990 found that health andnutritional indicators for young children enrolled in theprogram were significantly better than indicators fromsimilar communities in which the Pastoral da Criancahad no activities.Community health workers are also central to thesuccessful Aga Khan Health Service primary healthcare programs in remote mountainous areas of ruralPakistan. The CHWsvolunteers selected by the vil-lagerscollect epidemiological information, providehealth education, identify problems, and provide sim-ple treatment and referrals. They are backed up by mo-bile teams of physicians and nurses. health indicators (Box 6.2). These same evalua-tions point to four necessary (but difficult) condi-tions for success: community health workers mustbe well trained, well supervised, well providedwith logistical support, and linked to well-func-tioning district health systems for referral whenneeded.Increasing training in public health, management,policy, and planningImprovements in health systems performance canbe facilitated by training adequate numbers of poli-cymaking and management personnel, includingpublic health specialists, policy analysts, hospitalmanagers, and drug management specialists.These skills are in short supply in most developingcountries. Public health often receives little atten-tion in basic medical curricula, specialty training isoften inadequate, and courses in public healthschools may be too academic and not relevant tolocal problems and needs. In Sub-Saharan Africa,where public health capacity is weakest, fewerthan 100 people receive specialty training in publichealth annually. Some countries are exploring andimplementing multidisciplinary training programsthat include management and communicationtechniques as well as the traditional public healthsciences. An innovative example of public healthtraining designed to produce future leaders is theUnion School of Public Health in Beijing, estab-lished in 1989 to stimulate public health training in 143the entire country. The school offers a master'sdegree in public health and draws students andteachers both from health disciplines and fromeconomics, management, and the social and envi-ronmental sciences. Training is based on problemsolving, and more than half of the educational ex-perience is in the form of community service. InZimbabwe, under a new public health trainingprogram, students spend 75 percent of their timein the field.Health policy and planning and good manage-ment are fundamental (albeit insufficient) condi-tions for better performance of health services. Over the past thirty years the role of managers, economists, and planners in health services hasexpanded in the industrial countries. For example,in many of these countries professional (nonphysi-cian) hospital managers commonly run hospitals, in contrast to developing countries, where hospi- tals tend to be run by physicians. As developing countries seek to boost efficiency and as they move toward decentralized management of health facili-ties, the need for trained managers increases. Inmost developing countries, however, training pro-grams in these areas are poorly developed.Distance education can facilitate training in pub-lic health, health economics, and management byallowing rapid implantation of what are often new curricula without the time-consuming task of training a new generation of teachers. Distance learning has been used, for example, to build health research capacity in China. The University of Newcastle in Australia, in collaboration withChinese universities, has set up a postgraduatedistance-learning program in clinical epidemiol-ogy. The printed materials and academic stan-dards of the distance-learning program are equiva-lent to those in the Australian program. Chinese professors help the students with applied labora-tory and research work.Reforming the finance of health trainingMany of the problems with human resources inthe health sector derive from the fundamental flawof public subsidization of medical training. If phy-sicians paid the full costs of their training, it would be of no concern if they were later employed in nonmedical work. Public subsidies could be specif- ically targeted to encourage those training and ca-reer choices that are in the public interest.Student loans could replace most of the currentpublic subsidies for training. Repayment of loansmight then be forgone if the trainee agreed to work 144in a priority sector (such as primary care or publichealth) or in an underserved location. Not only would professionals be better distributed andused, but there would be substantial savings ofpublic resources.Almost every country today is grappling withproblems in the mix and quality of its health pro-fessionals. Government financial policies can playa constructive and central role in correcting marketfailures that lead to distortions in access to trainingand in the supply of professionals in differentfields. (For example, if credit is not widely access-ible, only the better-off may be able to go to medi-cal school; if the private rate of return for a certain specialty greatly exceeds the social rate of return,more professionals may choose that field thanwould be socially optimal.) Government policycan:Help meet the need for training primary careproviders and other health professionals by im-proving capital marketsusing student loan pro-grams, where feasibleand through national ser- vice mechanisms.Increase spending on training of, and im-prove public sector wages and benefits for, healthprofessionals in areas in which social benefits cur-rently exceed private returns. These include, inparticular, nonphysician primary care providers,health care managers, and staff in rural areas.Limit or eliminate subsidies and financial in-centives for specialist training.Improving the selection, acquisition, and useof drugsDrugs and vaccines embody much of the power ofmodern medicine. Governments can enhancetheir own utilization of drugs and assist the privatesector in increasing its efficiency through policiesthat improve selection, rationalize acquisition andproduction, and encourage better use. Throughdrug regulation and the development of a nationallist of essential drugs of established cost-effective-ness, governments can help providers and con-sumers make better choices among the approxi-mately 100,000 different drugscomposed of morethan 5,000 different active substancesnow avail-able worldwide. Governments can encouragehealth systems to buy drugs of assured qualityfrom the lowest-cost supplier, whether domesticor international. They can eliminate the incentives that in many countries induce physicians to over- prescribe drugs because of the profits they earnfrom directly dispensing them. In China, Japan,and Korea such incentives helped to drive drugspending up to 35 to 50 percent of total healthspending.Selecting essential drugsThe Model List of Essential Drugs developed byWHO suggests a basic list of drugs that WHO con-siders important and effective for dealing withhealth problems in developing countries. Firstdrawn up in 1977 by art expert panel, the originallist has been revised and updated seven times andnow includes about 270 products. It is designed toserve as a template from which countries can de-velop their own still more specific lists of essentialdrugs.Drugs on the national essential list are intendedto be available at all times and in the appropriate dosage forms in publicly provided health services.At the health center level about thirty to fortydrugs can treat almost all complaints. District hos-pitals require no more than 120 drugs. If properly purchased, these drugs tend to be relatively inex-pensive; almost all have multiple suppliers on in- ternational markets. Drugs are listed by interna-tional, nonproprietary (generic) names. Althoughmany countries have created these essential druglists, only a few have used them to guide purchas-ing and management of public sector (or publiclyfinanced) drug supplies. And occasionally nationaldrug lists have omitted important products, par- ticularly contraceptives.Bangladesh and Sudan use limited lists not onlyto select drugs for public financing but also to guide the national drug registration process, thereby affecting the mix of drugs available in the private sector as well. Norway has limited thenumber of drugs registered by incorporating cost-effectiveness, among other factors, into the reviewprocess. Since 1991 Zimbabwe has used its na- tional list to determine which drugs can be im-ported by the private sector without a permit.The applicability of the essential drug concept isnot limited to developing countries; drug formul-aries, which are detailed lists of essential drugs, are widely used by institutional health providers(public or private) and insurance companies in in-dustrial countries. The formulary contains thenames of drugs that are approved or recom-mended for health providers and supply systems. It also provides useful information for individual prescribers. In creating formularies, drugs are as- sessed on the basis of their safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness in comparison with othertherapeutic products. Evidence from the United Kingdom and other countries shows that the adoption of formularies can contribute to consider- able savings in drug costs if physicians are in- volved in their development and are educatedabout the results.Governments are also responsible for carryingout regulatory functions to ensure that all drugson the market are of acceptable quality, safety, andefficacy. Building up a national regulatory author-ity requires the creation of a core group of trainedstaff, enactment of supporting legislation for ad-ministrative drug review, and the establishment ofquality assurance laboratories. These are impor-tant areas for donor assistance and perhaps forinternationally shared efforts.Acquiring and producing drugsIn 1990 the public and private sectors in develop-ing countries spent an estimated $44 billion, or $10per capita, on pharmaceuticals. Global expendi-tures on pharmaceuticals amounted to about $220billion, or $40 per capita. Total expenditures onhuman vaccines, excluding those made in devel-oping countries, were between $1.6 billion and$2.0 billion in 1992. Drug expenditures vary widely, from a low of $2 per capita in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and in Bangladesh to a high of $412in Japan (Table 6.1). Table 6.1 Annual drug expenditures percapita, selected countries, 1990 Source; phar-maceuticals and vaccines account for between 5and 20 percent of health care spending, and, ex-cept in Canada and the United States, more thanhalf of all drug expenditures are publicly financed.Indeveloping countries,households'out-of-pocket expenditures make up a much larger pro- portion of total drug spending. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoireand Pakistan, more than 90 percent of householdhealth expenditure is devoted to drugs. In thepublic sector drugs generally account for between10 and 30 percent of total recurrent costs, makingthem the second largest category after salaries.Given this high volume of expenditure, achievingthe substantial improvements in efficiency ofprocurement that are possible becomes a highpriority. PURCHASING DRUGS AND VACCINES EFFICIENTLY.Some countries have achieved savings of 40 to 60percent in pharmaceutical expenditure by improv-ing selection and by competitive purchasing. Forexample, for several years the Costa Rican socialsecurity agency has been able to purchase drugs atapproximately half the price of its counterpart in-stitutions in other Central American countries,partly because of its use of centralized purchasing,more open and transparent purchasing pro-cedures, and selection of generic drugs on thebasis of its national essential drug list. This, ofcourse, is facilitated by Costa Rica's political stabil-ity. In 1986 several Caribbean islands joined to-gether to carry out international tenders throughthe Caribbean Development Bank. In the first yearthey saved 44 percent over previous prices.The first step toward efficient procurement iscareful quantification of drug and vaccine supplyneeds over a given period, using essential druglists or formularies where possible. Large stocks oflow-priority drugs have high opportunity costs:they tie up resources and may expire before theycan be used. Shortages of high-priority drugs arealso costly; emergency purchases from local sup-pliers are always expensive. Good forecasting per- mits economical purchasing.Some governments and many donors purchasedrugs through international agencies (see Box 6.3).These agencies use international tendering and,because of the scale of their purchases and theirlow operating margins, pass on very low prices.(The total amount of drugs procured in this way is,however, small in relation to total drug expendi-tures in developing countries.) UNICEF purchasedabout $160 million worth of pharmaceuticals, vac-cines, and related supplies for developing coun-tries in 1992. Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Box 6.3Buying right: how international agencies save on purchases of pharmaceuticalsUNICEF and several nonprofit organizations offer pur-chasing services that enable countries to obtain favor-able prices for drugs, vaccines, and some medicalequipment. UNICEF, the biggest in the field, has sup-plied basic drugs and vaccines since the 1960s. In 1983it issued its first international invitation to tender forthe bulk purchase of pharmaceuticals for Tanzania. Theprices quoted against the invitation to tender were upto 50 percent lower than previous price quotations. Asa result of this experience, UNICEF has continued touse international tendering for the bulk purchase ofpharmaceuticals and to pass on these favorable pricesto developing countries. UNICEF contracts with theDanish National Board of Health to provide advice onquality assurance for pharmaceutical products. In 1992UNICEF's purchases of drugs ($61.2 million), vaccines($63.6 million), and refrigeration equipment, syringes,needles, and sterilizers ($33.4 million) were deliveredto more than 120 countries.The International Dispensary Association (IDA), es-tablished in 1972, is a nonprofit supplier of drugs todeveloping countries. IDA procures drugs and sup-plies on behalf of governments and nonprofit organiza-tions in more than eighty developing countries. Its cur-rent annual turnover amounts to $80 million. IDA alsocarries out quality assurance, checking that manufac-turers produce in accordance with internationally ac-cepted standards. When the drugs are received, IDAtests samples for quality and verifies labels and certifi-cates of analysis.Price lists from UNICEF and IDA provide valuablemarket information for countries' own procurement.Competitive tendering in Mali reduced prices by 40percent. In Kenya bulk purchasing of carefully selectedessential drugs was estimated in 1985 to save nearly 40percent (or $700,000) of the annual drug bill for churchhealth institutions. In 1992 the Chinese governmentcarried out international competitive bidding for drugsfor tuberculosis treatment and_perhaps because of thevery large scale of procurement involved, the low-costpackaging requirements, and the desire of manufac-turers to enter the Chinese marketachieved savingsof about 70 percent of UNICEF's published prices. 146Zambia have all relied heavily on nonprofit inter-national drug suppliers.But many other developing countries fail to takeadvantage of international competition or interna-tional agencies. Purchasing methods, as well asimport restrictions, tend to restrict competitionand thereby raise prices. In addition, price compe-tition is restricted by the industry's extensive drugpromotion practices and, in the case of patentedproducts, by monopoly power. Some countries,such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe, protect localpharmaceutical industries from international com-petition (imported drugs will not be approved forimport and sale if there is a local producer), andBelize and other countries impose import tariffseven if there is no local production. This results ingreat variation in prices for pharmaceuticals andsupplies in developing countries. Cross-countrydata on the retail price of condoms show remark-able variation: condoms cost only $2 to $3 per 100in China, Egypt, and Tunisia, $15 to $30 per 100 inCosta Rica, Ecuador, and Mexico, and more than$70 per 100 in Brazil, Burundi, Myanmar, and Ven-ezuela. This price variation is attributable to a com-bination of factors, including import tariffs, importrestrictions, and wholesale and retail marketingstructures.Some countries purchase directly from a few lo-cal suppliers because of liquidity constraints. Inter-national agencies do not extend credit, and theyrequire payment in hard currency. Local suppliersoften extend credit in exchange for significantlyhigher prices. Changing this practice to take ad-vantage of benefits from competitive procurementwould require the ministries of both health andfinance to make budgetary funds and foreign ex-change available when needed for large-scale drugpurchases. Governments can also improve drugprocurement by passing legislation to facilitate ge-neric drug prescribing. This can increase the af-fordabilityof drugs purchased from privateoutlets. PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTION. The cost of de-veloping a sophisticated pharmaceutical industrywith a significant research base is huge. During1961-90, 90 percent of the approximately 2,000\"new chemical entities\" (new drugs) brought onthe market were discovered in only ten OECDcountries.FivecountriesinthedevelopingworldArgentina, China, India, Korea, and Mex-icodiscovered, developed, and marketed at leastone new chemical entity between 1961 and 1990.Several other developing countriesamong them,Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkeyhave primary man-ufacturing capabilities or the ability to produceboth therapeutic ingredients and finished prod-ucts. But most developing countries either haveonly the capacity to produce finished productsfrom imported ingredients or have no manufactur-ing capability whatsoever. (Countries in the lattergroup are typically very small.)Except in the largest countries that have primarymanufacturing capabilities, local pharmaceuticalproduction in developing countries is likely tomake sense only for intravenous fluids, whichhave relatively high transport costs; for local pack-aging of bulk imports in finishing plants; and forpackaging of oral rehydration salts. Even in theseactivities local production may be inefficient andwaste scarce resources. State-run drug and vaccinecompanies, from which the public sector pur-chases preferentially, are common in many coun-tries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, India, andLaos. In some countries the local pharmaceuticalindustry (public or private) produces drugs thatcould be purchased less expensively elsewhere.Such industries survive only because of the protec-tion accorded through the prohibition of compet-ing imports, through import tariffs, or throughguaranteed agreements for public purchase re-gardless of price.The combination of protection and poor regula-tion can be particularly damaging. A 1990 study ofmore than 6,000 infants in Bangladesh revealedthat the mothers' tetanus toxoid vaccinations didnot reduce the risk of tetanus. Subsequent testingin reference laboratories of Bangladesh-producedvaccine indicated no potency in several consecu-tive batches, raising questions about the efficacy ofthe more than 40 million doses already adminis-tered. Since Bangladesh has no independent na-tionalcontrol authority for certifying vaccinesafety, all testing had been done by the productionfacility itself. Evidence suggests that few publicsector pharmaceutical and vaccine producers havebeen able to operate competitively, in terms ofprice and quality, in the highly competitive andrapidly changing pharmaceuticals market. Im-proved selection and purchasing practicesratherthan protection of drug manufacturingwill usu-ally be the best ways to counter the market powerof international suppliers of drugs. IMPROVING STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION. Theft,spoilage, and shortages are major problems facingpublic distribution in many countries. Systems forinventory control, port clearing, storage, and de- 147livery can address many of these problems. InZimbabwe a standard nationwide system of stockcontrol was fundamental to recent reforms in thedrug supply system. Surveys show a gradual im-provement in drug availability: in 1991 the facili-ties surveyed had 78 percent of the representativeessential drugs in stock, up from 38 percent in1987. In hospitals, management information sys-tems help to track periods of drug validity and toanalyze rotation rates and drug consumption. Influencing prescription and self-medicationpatternsSignificant efficiencies can be achieved by improv-ing prescription and self-medication practices.Widespread overprescription and inappropriateprescription have been documented in most coun-tries. For example, recent surveys found that theaverage number of drugs prescribed per singleconsultation in public health centers ranged from1.3 in Zimbabwe and Ecuador to as high as 3.3 inIndonesia and 3.8 in Nigeria. These surveys alsodocumented that unnecessarily high proportionsof drugs were being administered in the form ofinjections (which carry the risk of abscesses, nerveinjuries, and transmission of infectious disease)and that extensive overuse of antibiotics was oc-curring. A survey of seventy-five pharmacies inthree Asian countries found that only sixteen gaveappropriate advice regarding oral rehydration fortreatment of diarrhea in infants.Public policies for improving prescription andmedication practices include:Distribution to health care providers andpharmacists of regularly updated essential druglists or formularies that include descriptions ofuse, dose, adverse reactions, and costs; examplesinclude the British National Formulary and theUganda Drug FormularyStrengthening of medical and nursing train-ing regarding pharmacology, appropriate prescrib-ing practices, and problems caused by over-prescription and unnecessary use of injectionsPublic education on appropriate drug use, thedisadvantages of injections when oral doses areavailable, and the importance of compliance withthe full course of therapyRemoval of financial incentives that encour-age physicians to overprescribe.Unlike facilities, equipment, and human re-sources, pharmaceuticals and vaccines are an areain which government policies can alter input userelatively quickly. And good policies could make asignificant contribution. Because consumers and148providers cannot possibly review all the informa-tion available on the quality, safety, and efficacy ofdrugs and vaccines, governmental involvement inregulation and in provision of information is nec-essary. In addition, the government must managedrug selection, procurement, and distribution forpublicly provided health services. To support therational use of drugs, governments can:Develop a national list of essential drugs anddirect public finance to those drugs that supportthe essential package of clinical services and publichealth interventions.Purchase drugs competitively and reduce oreliminate protection of local pharmaceutical pro-duction of vaccines and drugs. These policies workto consumers' benefit. Efficient local industry isbest created under competitive conditions.Provide information to public and private pro-viders and consumers on drug use and cost-effec-tiveness and establish regulations that discourageoveruse or overprescription.Generating information and strengtheningresearchIn health, as elsewhere, good information facili-tates sound decisionmaking. Although some basichealth information is generated by the private sec-tor without government involvement, the govern-ment has a central role in requiring, standardizing,and financing the collection, analysis, and dissem-ination of health information, as well as in financ-ing health systems research. Governments are al-readyheavilyinvolvedindatacollection.Unfortunately, the data are often irrelevant to p01-icy and program design. And too often, the privatesector is ignored when statistics are being gath-ered. Revamping health information systems is anattractive investment, both because it is relativelyinexpensive and because poor decisions based oninadequate information can be very costly. But theimpact of information systems depends cruciallyon the decisionmaking environment. Even thebest systems may be seen as irrelevant if managershave no incentive or scope for using information toimproveefficiency.Informationhelpsguidechoices among the existing options, and invest-ments in research and development create newoptions, both for households and for providers ofcare. It can be argued that investments in researchhave been the source of the enormous improve-ments in health in this century. This section dis-cusses ways of ensuring continued benefits fromresearch, as well as the role of the internationalcommunity in this task.Understanding health status and health risksAn essential step toward improving health is tounderstand the distribution of disease, death, anddisability. This requires the systematic collection,analysis, and dissemination of timely and accurateinformation on mortality, morbidity, and risk fac-tors. Such data are a cornerstone of public healthefforts in any country, and the government's roleis central in creating them because the private sec-tor has little interest in producing such publicgoods. Epidemiological data are used to estimatethe magnitude of health problems, study risk fac-tors, evaluate health programs and the effective-ness of interventions, detect epidemics, facilitateplanning, and monitor changes in health practices.These data could be used to estimate a nationalburden of disease similar to the global burden ofdisease estimated for this Report. The nationalburden of disease would quantify the loss ofhealthy life from the diseases that are important inthe specific country. It could be used to monitorand track over time improvements in both mortal-ity and morbidity.Some countries have established surveillancesystems that rely on sentinel districts selected to beroughly representative of the country. To improvethe speed and accuracy of reporting, data collec-tion systems are upgraded in these districts to agreater degree than could be done for the countryas a whole. Cause-specific death rates, vaccinecoverage, the effectiveness of vaccines, and theimpact of specific health interventions are thenmonitored intensively within the district. Nationalhousehold surveys can also generate a wealth ofinformation on health status, risk factors, and theutilization of health services according to age, sex,region, and racial and ethnic group (see Box 6.4).Unlike government health service statistics, popu-lation-based surveys cover nonusers as well asusers of public services.Monitoring health spending and equityPrevious chapters have recommended redirectingpublic spending to nationally defined essentialclinical services, targeted largely to the poor, andto public health interventions, leaving to private Box 6.4The contribution of standardized survey programs to health informationThree internationally supported standardized house-hold survey programs have contributed immensely toknowledge of health conditions, particularly those ofchildren, in the developing world over the past threedecades. The World Fertility Survey (WFS) sponsoredforty-three surveys between 1974 and 1982, with fund-ing from the U.S. Agency for International Develop-ment (USAID) and the United Nations PopulationFund (UNPF) and some country contributions towardthe costs of survey fieldwork. The Demographic andHealth Surveys (DHS) program, started in 1984, has sofar implemented thirty-nine surveys in thirty coun-tries; the third phase of the survey program, with aplanned twenty-five surveys, is about to begin. TheDHS program has received funding from USAID, withcontributions from countries and other donors.Both the WFS and the DHS program have used acommon core questionnaire around which specialtopics could be explored. The core WFS questionnairewas primarily concerned with fertility and fertility-related behavior; for each eligible woman it included abirth history, recording the date of each birth and, ifthe child had died, the age at death. This informationbase has provided much of what is known about childmortality trends and the relationships between childmortality and birth spacing, maternal education, andhousehold characteristics. The DHS questionnaire, inaddition to a birth history, includes questions about.-immunizations, health care behavior, and other aspectsof child health. DHS survey information has been usedfor purposes as diverse as examining the effects of eco-nomic reversals on demographic outcomes and study-ing small area variations in child mortality risks in ur-ban areas.Neither survey program has collected detailed eco-nomic information on households and communities.The World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Sur-vey (LSMS) was designed to fill this need by studyingthe determinants and interactions of poverty, health,education, nutrition, and labor activities. The surveycollects a wealth of information about incomes, pro-duction, and prices. Some LSMS surveys are fundedthrough World Bank-financed projects, but many havereceived grant support from a variety of bilateral do-nors, the UNDP, and other agencies.The experience with these standardized surveys in-dicates the great value of using comparable survey pro-cedures and instruments across countries and the im-portance of rigorous supervision at all stages of thesurvey operation, from sampling to data processing.The LSMS and DHS programs have been particularlysuccessful with respect to turnaround time; prelimi-nary findings from a survey are available within sixweeks of the conclusion of fieldwork, and a final reporttypically becomes available within one year. 149finance health services outside the essential pack-age. Private expenditures are always difficult toestimate, but even in the public sector, spending ispoorly disaggregated by use. By revamping infor-mation systems, estimates can be made of spend-ing on public health interventions and on catego-ries of inputs (essential drugs, nonessential drugs,primary care physicians, other primary care pro-viders, specialists, health centers, district hospi-tals, and tertiary hospitals). Although still imper-fect, such estimates better capture the nature ofgovernment spending. In addition, public expen-ditures need to be regularly consolidated acrossfederal, state, and local levels for analysis. In Bra-zil, where state and local governments account forabout half of all public spending on health, expen-diture estimates are available only for federalspending (except for 1984). Much less informationis compiled from state and municipal levels, de-spite their importance. Household surveys cancollect appropriate information for monitoringwho benefits from public health spending. In partbecause such data are lacking, analyses of equityin health care have been carried out in only ahandful of developing countries, among them Co-lombia, Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Ma-laysia, and Peru.National research prioritiesGovernments have a role in supporting the re-search necessary for understanding specific localhealth problems and for guiding public policymak-ing and program design. This \"essential nationalhealth research,\" which is also undertaken by theprivate sector, examines health strategy in moredepth than is done with day-to-day budgetary andmanagement information. The international com-munity can help both in gathering data for interna-tional comparisons and in assisting local institu-tions to build up capacity in epidemiology, healtheconomics, health policy, and management. Re-search priorities in this area include cost-effective-ness analysis of health interventions, evaluationsof medical practice and of variations in practice(see Box 6.5), and studies of drug utilization, eq-uity, consumer satisfaction, and women's health.Where the national burden of disease is highand cost-effective interventions already exist, re-search can guide program implementation. Onesuch example is the problem of intestinal parasiticworms. How can local programs be best designedto reach children? How can involvement of schoolofficials be fostered? Another area is tuberculosis,where treatment compliance is a chronic problem; Box 6.5Evaluating cesarean sections in BrazilOperations research can examine variations in medicalpractice with a view to identifying areas in whichchanges in practice are needed, as well as possible in-struments for modifying provider practice. In the early1980s Brazil was estimated to have the highest overallcesarean section rate in the world-31 percent of allhospital births in 1981. Although cesarean sections area life-saving procedure in certain circumstances, theirunnecessary use raises costs and poses medical risksfor the mother and the newborn. The financial cost ofunnecessary publicly financed cesareans in Brazil wasestimated at about $60 million annually in the late1980s. Medical risks stem from incorrect estimation ofthe length of gestation (leading to premature deliv-eries), infection from surgery, and the use of generalanesthesia. Among the many factors responsible forthe rising rate of cesareans in Brazil are the financialand administrative incentives for hospitals and doctorsto perform cesarean deliveries, the desire to use a Ce-sarean delivery as a vehicle for obtaining a sterilization,and the widespread view that cesarean section is thepreferred, \"modern\" way to deliver.Brazilian studies of cesarean section rates illustratesystematic variations by region, type of hospital, socio-economic status of the woman, and reimbursementpatterns. Rates in 1981 were higher in the more pros-perous Southeast (38 percent) and lowest in the poorNortheast (20 percent). In every region the incidence ofcesarean section increased with family income. A 1986survey showed that rates were highest for women witha university education (61 percent) and for births inprivate hospitals (57 percent). Other studies showedthat rates were lowest among women with no insur-ance. Women covered under the social security systemhad higher rates of cesarean section, and women withprivate insurance had the highest.The country's social security institute changed its re-imbursement policies in the early 1980s to removesome of the financial incentives for cesarean sections,and education campaigns for physicians were initiated.But it is clear that even stronger policies are needed toreverse these trends, as cesarean section rates havecontinued at high levels. A large sample of births in thestate of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1991, for example, indicated acesarean section rate of 47 percent. 150patients often stop taking medication once theyfeel better, but before the problem has been effec-tively treated. What program approaches workbest in different settings to ensure compliancewith directions? In nutrition, how can policies andprograms promote dietary change most effec-tively? Solutions to these problems are not univer-sal. Research must be local, and often public sup-port is needed.In its 1990 report the Commission on Health Re-search for Development recommended the forma-tion of international partnerships or networks tofocus on ensuring that national health resourcesare used to maximum effect. The InternationalNetwork for the Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD),established in 1989, is one such network. Anotheris the International Clinical Epidemiology Net-work (INCLEN), which was started in the early1980s by the Rockefeller Foundation to build up acritical mass of researchers in clinical epidemiol-ogy,including epidemiologists,health econo-mists, and biostatisticians. IN-CLEN enrolls midcareer physicians whohold positions of influence in the medical systemsof developing countries. Itprovides overseasstudy opportunities, support for research, and theopportunity toparticipate in annual scientificmeetings. The network concept has permittedunits to share experiences and teaching materialsand to carry out collaborative research betweenclinical epidemiology units, training centers, andthe international health community. Capacitybuilding is a lengthy process, but INCLEN has al-ready influenced health policy. Research on theeffectiveness and efficiency of hepatitis B immu-nization in the Philippines brought about the addi-tion of hepatitis B vaccine to the national EPI pro-gram. Studies on the cost-effectiveness of short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis have led to achange in national treatment policies in Brazil, thePhilippines, and Thailand.Improving information at the district and facility levelsHealth organizations also benefit from improve-ment of the information needed to make everydaymanagement decisions. In publicly provided dis-trict health facilities, simple management informa-tion systems for measuring costs, inputs, and pro-duction could be helpful for monitoring programefforts over time and for making decisions abouthow to combine inputs efficiently. Yet many publicfacilities operate without such information. With-out basic data on costs, it is difficult to decide, forexample, whether to contract out services such aslaundry, food preparation, and laboratory testing.Systems that gather information on vaccine utiliza-tion, equipment and vehicle inventories, preven-tive maintenance for buildings and equipment,personnel management, and the like are alsofundamental.Ministries of health frequently pay little atten-tion to the activities of private providers, insteadfocusing all data collection efforts on public pro-viders. To remedy this, governments can collectbasic information about private providers and thepopulation covered under private insurance plans.They can require standardized reporting fromboth public and private hospitals through uniformhospital discharge data. The information can thenbe synthesized to provide consumers, health re-searchers,and communities with informationabout the quality of care given by providers, bothpublic and private, and about variations in medicalpractice. These systems can generate sophisticatedinformation; consumers in California, for example,can obtain risk-adjusted mortality rates by hospitalfor common procedures. But relatively simplemeasures can also be useful; an example is ce-sarean section rates, by hospital, which can helpidentify overuse of this procedure (see Box 6.5).Such standardized information about hospital per-formance can help consumers make better choicesabout health care and can help central authoritiesidentify problems to be corrected.If there are incentives for using information indecisionmaking, improvements in data gatheringcan often be inspired simply by giving those whoneed the information more training in how to col-lect it and more responsibility for doing so. Districtmedical officers, hospital superintendents, andhealth care managers are usually not trained tomake the best use of data. Whenever possible, tab-ulation of data should be decentralized so that lo-cal decisionmakers can immediately use the infor-mation instead of relying on feedback from centrallevels. In Papua New Guinea, for example, whenlocal-level staff began to see the relevance of man-agement information for their work, they soughtto verify data and to eliminate reporting that wasirrelevant.To summarize, governments have a twofold rolein health information systems and operational re-search: generating the information necessary toguide health policies and public spending and pro-viding certain types of information about providerperformance that would be too costly for con-sumers to collect. To this end, governments can:Gather and synthesize epidemiological and 151Table 6.2 Some priorities for research and product development, ranked by the top six contributorsto the global burden of disease 152other information necessary to monitor health sta-tus, detect disease outbreaks, and guide publicpolicy and program designSupport research, where needed, to generatelocal solutions to local problemsFacilitatestandardizationofinformationabout health production and health outcomes bydistrict health systems and other major health pro-viders; where necessary, synthesize and publicizethis information to aid consumers in making in-formed choices about health care. Expanding the range of choiceA revolution in health care technology has takenplace in the course of this century. Significant bio-medical breakthroughs that have generated inter-national benefitsfor developing countries as wellas for the established market economiesincludethe development of measles, pertussis, polio, andtetanus vaccines; chioroquine for the treatment ofNote: The demographically developing countries are those in the Sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Other Asia and islands, Latin America andthe Caribbean, and Middle Eastern crescent regions.

DALYs,disability-adjusted life years; see Box 1.3.Less than 0.5 million.Total for all conditions in hormonalcontraceptives.Basic research and product development arepublic goods that require support through govern-ment subsidy or intervention (for example, grantsof patents). In addition, because the poor in devel-oping countries lack market power, the system ofpatent protection fails to provide incentives to thecommercial sector for developments related to dis-eases of the poor. Thus, there is a clear argumentfor government and international assistance to cat-alyze technological development. In the develop-ing world many serious health problems do notpresent sufficiently attractive commercial marketsto induce the development by private companiesof better methods of prevention, diagnosis, andtreatment. Developing countries account for al-most 90 percent of the global burden of disease,and much of that burden is from conditions suchas malaria or tuberculosis that primarily occur inPerinatal and 1254Methods of lowering costs of intervention andmaternal causes improving delivery in rural areas.Respiratory infections 1194Impact of indoor air pollution on pneumonia (to guideinterventions designed to reduce pneumonia by useof improved stoves); inexpensive simplifiedantibiotic ways of improvinghygiene; better case management of persistentdiarrhea; prevention of diarrhea by the promotion ofbreastfeeding and improved weaning practicesIschemic heart and 5827Low-cost prevention, diagnosis, and managementcerebrovascular disease methodsChildhood cluster: 67Development of new and improved vaccines to reducediphtheria, polio, patient contacts, permit immunization at youngerpertussis, measles, and ages, and improve heat stability of some vaccinestetanus Tuberculosis 461Methods of ensuring compliance; or injury countriesFSE and EME Priority areasthose countries. Only about 5 percent of the $30billion global investment in health research in 1986went to health problems unique to developingcountries.Setting prioritiesWhere is extra research really likely to pay off?Table 6.2 suggests priorities for research on pre-vention, diagnosis, and case management for thesix conditions that make the largest contributionsto the global burden of disease. These conditionsaccount for about 40 percent of the DALYs lost indemographically developing countries and forabout 25 percent of the losses in industrial coun-tries (where cardiovascular disease accounts formuch of the burden). If the global burden causedby a disease is large, if no cost-effective interven-tions exist, and if experts believe that such inter-ventions might be developed, there is a case forgreater investment in research and product devel-opment. One example that meets these criteria isinexpensive, simple, and reliable diagnostics forrespiratory infections. For problems that create alarge burden of disease and for which cost-effec-tive interventions already exist, there is a need todirect efforts more toward program developmentand operational research to guide implementation.For example,littleis known about low-costmethods of managing ischemic heart disease indeveloping country settings. One low-cost ap-proach that is being adopted in many industrialcountries is the use of low daily doses of aspirin toreduce the risk of obstructive blood clots inside thearteries. This approach, developed on the basis ofthe results of large-scale assessments of the effi-cacy of the intervention, illustrates the potentialbenefits of research on low-cost case management.International agencies and governments canstimulate research on health and product develop-ment in several ways. They can provide informa-tion on potential markets for new products, in-cluding epidemiological data about the disease,the target population, and the technical require-ments of desirable innovations. They can subsi-dize a portion of the development costs. They canfacilitate or finance field evaluations in a variety ofsettings and support introduction of the technol-ogy in the field. Finally, they can provide procure-ment guarantees for new or improved products atan agreed-on price. A few examples illustrate thepotential.Nuw AND IMPROVED CHILDHOOD VACCINES. TheEPI currently includes vaccines against six dis-eases: measles, tetanus,pertussis,diphtheria,polio, and tuberculosis. It requires at least sevenpatient contacts (two for the pregnant mother andfive for the infant). Possible improvements in vac-cine technology would reduce multidose vaccinesto a single dose, improve the heat stability of vac-cines, simplify administrative requirements (topermit greater use of oral vaccines as comparedwith injections, for example), create new combina-tions of vaccines to reduce patient contacts, inte-grate new vaccines into the immunization sched-ule, permit vaccination earlier in life to reduceinfant deaths caused by vaccine-preventable dis-eases, and add to the menu of interventions newvaccinesfor example, against diarrhea and pneu-monia. These innovations would reduce some ofthe costs and improve the effectiveness of vaccina-tion programs. An important source of support forthis research is the Children's Vaccine Initiative(CVI), which is identifying measures for catalyzingtechnological development in these areas. TheCVI, which has its secretariat at WHO, is an inter-national effort to harness new technologies thatcan advance the immunization of children.TROPICAL DISEASES. It is primarily the rural poorwho suffer from tropical diseases such as malaria,schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocer-ciasis (river blindness), trypanosomiasis, and lep-rosy. These diseases create a high burden, and ex-isting interventions are inadequate against manyof them. The UNDP-World Bank-WHO SpecialProgramme for Research and Training in TropicalDiseases (TDR) is developing partnerships withcommercial entities, national governments, scien-tists, and NGOs to support research and drug de-velopment for these diseases. One strategy theprogram has adopted is to look for new applica-tions of drugs already in use in human or veteri-nary medicine. An example is the use of ivermec-tin, a drug originally marketed by Merck & Co. fortreating worms in animals, in the fight against on-chocerciasis in human populations (see Box 1.1).The TDR program facilitated the field testing ofthis product on a large scale for human use. Theresults showed that the drug was very safe, that itcould be distributed by primary health careworkers, and that one oral dose per year couldprevent or arrest blindness. As a veterinary prod-uct, ivermectin has estimated annual sales of $500million; Merck & Co. agreed to supply the drugwithout charge to governments for treatment ofhuman onchocerciasis. The TDR's network of in-ternationally funded research centers in develop- 153Box 6.6 An unmet need: inexpensive and simple diagnostics for STDsThis Report recommends that concerted efforts bemade to develop or strengthen effective programs forcontrol of STDs. Such efforts will be hampered by thechallenges of diagnosing STDs, particularly in women,for whom the vast majority of infections are asympto-matic. Current methods are often unreliable and ex-pensive, and their use requires refrigeration, electric-ity, and sophisticated equipment and training. Inaddition, certain tests require patients to return in oneor two days, which is not feasible when, as is often thecase, the patient must travel a long distance to receivehealth care. Even if patients return, the period of infec-tivity is prolonged by this delay in therapy. Syndromic-based approaches to treating STDs are currently beingused to bridge this gap and are effective for men. Forwomen, however, these approaches are less accurate.New diagnostics that are inexpensive, simple, andconvenient to use and provide rapid, stable, and accu-rate results would overcome these problems. An exam-ple of such a tool is a new HIV test. The availability ofHJV testing has been limited by high cost, complexity,and requirements for reagents that need refrigerationand have a short shelf life. Even when labor costs areexcluded, testing and confirmation can cost $25to$50(although this cost is declining rapidly). The HIV dip- ing countries allowed it to respond quickly andflexibly to the opportunity to test ivermectin.Women spend up to half of their reproductivelives pregnant or lactating. Many protocols fortreating tropical diseases exclude these womenand sometimes even large numbers of womenwho might be pregnant (such as adolescent girls).Blanket exclusion of pregnant or lactating womenhas been the result not of clear evidence of prob-lems but of reluctance to carry out appropriatedrug trials on pregnant women. There is an urgentneed to evaluate drug treatments for such womenso that health services can offer them better treat-ment. This is part of a much broader problem ofthe common omission of women from medicalstudies and clinical trials in both developing andindustrial countries. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. Another priority area forresearch and development is the development oflow-cost and efficient diagnostic technologies foruse in health centers in developing countrieswhere sophisticated laboratories are unavailable.Examples of potentially important new technolo-gies are visual methods of screening for cervical 154stick, developed by the Program for Appropriate Tech-nology for Health with support from Canada's Interna-tional Development Research Centre (IDRC) and fromprivate funds, uses synthetic peptides and a colorchange to provide an easily performed test. The testtakes twenty minutes, requires only three simple steps,is stable for six months at tropical temperatures, has apattern of sensitivity and specificity similar to commer-cially available tests, and costs less than $0.20. Thus,the per patient cost for testing can be brought down toless than $1.00, including a confirmatory second test.This test is now being commercially produced in Indiaand Thailand. The Canadian International Develop-ment Agency (CIDA) is funding the establishment of aproduction facility in Cameroon, and there is interestin production in Brazil, Indonesia, and Zimbabwe.The STD Diagnostics Initiative, which is funded bymultiple donors, was established to facilitate develop-ment of appropriate diagnostics for resource-limitedsettings. The initiative, being carried out in collabora-tion with industry, clarifies and validates performancecriteria for STD diagnostics, organizes and supportsfield trials, provides seed money for the developmentof new diagnostics, and brokers bulk purchases to cre-ate markets of adequate size. cancer, rapid plasma finger-stick diagnostic toolsfor syphilis, and new diagnostic tests for malariafor use at the local level. (Box 6.6 provides anotherexample.) Rapid diagnostic tests avoid reliance onother levels of the health system because thehealth center,ifsupplied with the necessarydrugs, can treat the problem on the spot. Innova-tions in medical equipment to reduce the cost orimprove the effectiveness of preventing and treat-ing problems at the health center level are highpriorities for research and development.International aspectsSome types of research and product developmentare costly; it can cost more than $100 million tobring a new drug to market. But several break-throughs in medical technology have been inex-pensive. (One of them, oral rehydration therapy,is now widely recognized as an effective way oftreating acute watery diarrhea, which, untreated,can weaken or kill young children.) The need forpublic support for certain types of research iswidely understood. The international communityhas played an important role in supporting healthresearch, and most governments support some re-search as well. Over the short to medium term,developing countries can use their scarce publicresources best if:Governments reduce or eliminate finance ofbasic biomedical research that generates interna-tional benefits (which is best supported by the in-ternational community) and redirect it toward re-search efforts that generate primarily nationalbenefitsThe international community directs researchsupport toward new and improved technologieswhere the expected social returns are highest andwould benefit many countries.International financing is needed for importantbiomedical research when the benefits transcendnational borders and the research will not be un-dertaken by the private sector at socially optimallevels. (Even research that is internationally fi-nanced will take place principally in developingcountries and will be done increasingly by scien-tists from developing countries.) The total invest-ment in health technology research relevant to theneeds of the developing countries is woefully in-adequate in relation to its potential benefits. Andthe level of international coordination and cooper-ation falls well short of what is required. An inter-national mechanism with stable funding over themedium to long term could more effectively buildresearch capacity in developing countries. Donorsand governments also need to give more supportto activities for testing new technologies and incor-porating them into health systems. 155An agenda for action The policy conclusions of this Report can be tai-lored to the widely varying circumstances of de-veloping countries. This chapter highlights the pri-ority policy issues and actions that are likely to bemost relevant for three groups of countries: low-income countries in Africa and South Asia, mid-dle-income countries in Latin America and EastAsia, and the formerly socialist countries of Eu-rope and Central Asia. It describes the reformsneeded in the health sector and assesses their fea-sibility, examines the principal obstacles to reform,and outlines possible strategies for overcomingthese obstacles. Although policy reform must dealwith difficult underlying problems, the experienceof a number of developing countries with imple-menting significant policy changes shows that suc-cess is possible.This chapter also examines the role of the inter-national community in supporting improvementsin health policies and programs in developingcountries. Despite widespread calls for more do-nor investment in human resources and in povertyreduction programs, aid flows to the health sectordeclined from 7 percent of total development assis-tance in the early 1980s to 6 percent in the latterhalf of the 1980s. Donors need to match their ver-bal commitments with actions: the share of aid forhealth should be restored to its previous level im-mediately and should be increased substantiallyover the next five years. An additional $2 billion inaid would help to finance the transitional cost ofhealth policy reforms, as well as priority pro-grams, including AIDS prevention. At the sametime, donors and developing countries need tofocus on measures to improve the effectiveness ofexternal assistance for health. Doing so will re- 156quire donor backing for major reforms in the al-location of public spending for health and inhealth policy more generally.The effectiveness of donor spending can be im-proved through increased investment in basicpublic health measures and essential clinical care,steps to strengthen the policy and regulatoryframework for insurance and for delivery of ser-vices, and backing for research to expand therange of cost-effective treatments available to thepoor in developing countries. Aid for lower-prior-ity items, including tertiary care hospitals andtraining of medical specialists, needs to be corre-spondingly reduced or eliminated.Finally, improved coordination among donorscould raise the effectiveness of aid. Despite themany serious obstacles, the recent experience of anumber of African and Asian countries shows thatsuch coordination can be achieved.Health policy reform in developing countriesThe policies that this Report suggests should be atthe top of the agenda for developing countries andthe donor community are summarized in Table7.1. This section describes those policies and pro-vides examples of successful policy reforms in var-ious developing countries. Low-income countriesPrevious chapters have outlined the main charac-teristics of health systems in low-income coun-tries. In general, there is little public or privateinsurance. Out-of-pocket spending for drugs, tra-ditional medicine, and user fees usually accountsTable 7.1 The relevance of policy changes for three country groups Government objectives and policies Foster an enabling environment for households to improve healthPursue economic growth policies that benefit the poor Expand investment in education, particularly for femalesPromote the rights and status of women through political andeconomic empowerment and legal protection against abuseImprove government investments in healthReduce government expenditures fortertiary carefacilities, specialist training, and discretionary servicesFinance and ensure delivery of a public health package, includingAIDS preventionFinance and ensure delivery of essential clinical services, at least tothe poorImprove the management of public health servicesFacilitate involvement by the private sectorEncourage private finance and provision of insurance (withincentives to contain costs) for all discretionary clinical servicesEncourage private sector delivery of clinical services, includingthose that are publicly financedProvide information on performance and cost for more than half of total spending for health.Government financing from general tax reve-nuesand sometimes substantial donor contribu-tionsaccount for the remainder. Governmenthospitals and clinics provide the bulk of modernmedical care, but they suffer from highly central-ized decisionmaking, wide fluctuations in annualbudget allocations, and poor motivation of bothfacility managers and health care workers. Minis-tries of health and other government agencies of-ten have only limited capacity to formulate healthpolicy, implement health plans, and regulate theprivate sector. Private providers (mainly religiousorganizations in Africa and private physicians andunlicensed practitioners in South Asia) account forthe remainder of the health facilities and delivermost outpatient care. They offer a service that isperceived to be of higher quality than that pro-vided by the public sector. Large segments of thepopulation, especially the rural poor, do not haveaccess to modern health services. Female literacyand enrollment of girls in primary and secondaryschool are low.Five policies for better health are crucial in thisenvironment: providing solid primary schoolingfor all children, especially girls; investing more re-sources in highly cost-effective public health activ-ities that can substantially improve the health of 157Very relevant0 Relevant0 Somewhat relevant Not relevantthe poor; shifting health spending for clinical ser-vices from tertiary care facilities to district healthinfrastructure capable of delivering essential clini-cal care; reducing waste and inefficiency in gov-ernment health programs; and encouraging in-creased community control and financing ofessential health care.INCREASED SCHOOLING. Despite the often formi-dable obstaclesboth in providing access toschools and in eliminating cultural barriers thatkeep girls outa number of low-income countrieshave proved that dramatic change is possible in ashort period of time. Between 1970 and 1990 Indo-nesia and Kenya, for example, achieved rapid andsustained growth of primary school enrollmentsand raised the proportion of girls to nearly half ofall pupils. These gains were brought about by acombination of high-level political commitment touniversal primary schooling, information pro-grams that created stronger demand on the part ofparents, and support from the internationalcommunity.INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. Thepublic health activities with the largest payoff willvary from country to country: vitamin A and io-dine supplementation in India and Indonesia,antismoking campaigns in China, and policies toreduce traffic injuries in urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. Completion of immunization cov-erage should be a high priority in all low-incomecountries, especially in India and in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, where coverage remains low. Sim-ilarly, a greatly intensified effort to reduce trans-mission of HIV and other sexually transmitted dis-eases is warranted. In the parts of Africa in whichthe AIDS epidemic is already widespread, behav-ioral change through education and condom distri-bution should be high on the list of public healthactions. And where, as in Bangladesh and Indo-nesia, the preconditions (widespread commercialsex and high prevalence of other STD5) exist forrapid spread of HIV, governments urgently needto take steps to halt the spread of AIDS from high-risk groups into the population at large.BETrER ALLOCATION OF SPENDING ON CLINICALSERVICES. Governments should invest in distficthealth infrastructure by (as described in Chapter 6)expanding training programs for primary care pro-viders, particularly nurses and midwives; target-ing construction funds to improve health posts,health centers, and district hospitals; financingambulances and other vehicles needed for effec-tive emergency transport, together with the neces-158sary radio and telephone networks; and buildingthe capacity to plan and manage health services atthe district level and in individual facilities. Inmany low-income countries, focusing on districthealth infrastructure will mean limiting new in-vestment in central hospitals and reorienting thosefacilities toward research and teaching activitiesthat are more relevant to key national health prob-lems. At the same time, there is considerable scopefor improving the efficiency of large governmenthospitals, especially through performance-linkedincentives for managers and staff and expandedcost recovery from the wealthy and insured.To deliver essential clinical services, a greatershare of government health budgets needs to bedevoted to the operations of lower-level facilitiesand especially to nonsalary recurrent items. Initialemphasis needs to be placed on building capacityto deliver the services included in the minimumessential package described in Chapter 5. This isnow happening in a number of countries. Senegalhas set annual targets for increasing its spendingfor drugs, transport, and maintenance. Ghana istrying to reduce the number of civil servants work-ing for the Ministry of Health. In India, wherestate governments account for more than three-quarters of total public spending for health, thecentral government is attempting to act as a cata-lyst for more cost-effective resource allocation byearmarking its funds for immunization, treatmentof leprosy and tuberculosis, and AIDS control.Some low-income countries will need to in-crease government outlays for health if they are tofinance a package of public health measures andessential clinical services for the poor. In 1990 gov-ernment spending for health in low-income coun-tries averaged only $6 per capita-1.5 percent ofGNP if foreign assistance is excluded and 1.6 per-cent including aid. The analysis in this Report in-dicates that provision of a minimum package willcost about $12 per capita in low-income countries,or nearly 3 percent of GNP. Effective targeting ofpublicly subsidized clinical services to the poor,and corresponding efforts to encourage cost recov-ery from more affluent groups, would help stretchlimited government budgets. Modest fees col-lected at health centers could also be retained andreinvested locally to improve the quality and re-liability of basic services.But even with these efforts, many governmentsin low-income countries will have to increase theshare of the budget allocated to health. (In Sub-Saharan Africa health spending declined duringthe 1980s to an average of less than 4 percent ofpublic expenditure and less than 2 percent ofBox 7.1Community financing of health centers: the Bamako InitiativeThe principal aim of the Bamako Initiative, launched in1988, is to \"revitalize the public sector health care de-livery system [byl strengthening district management[andi capturing some of the resources the people them-selves are spending on health\" (UNICEF 1992).Both revolving funds for drug purchases and com-munity-managed health centers have existed for manyyears in developing countries, but the Bamako Initia-tive is attempting to implement these schemes on amuch larger scale in Africa and other low-income coun-tries. The initiative is based on two premises: thatwhere public institutions are weak, as they are in manylow-income countries, bottom-up action by commu-nities is badly needed to complement top-down healthpolicy reforms, and that even poor households are will-ing to pay for higher-quality and more reliable healthservices.Under the initiative, members of local communitieswho use a health center or pharmacy agree to pay mod-est charges for outpatient care, including drugs. Therevenues generated from fees are retained by thehealth centers and managed by local elected commit-tees. The committees reinvest in additional drugs(through a revolving fund), in incentive payments forhealth workers, and in other improvements. The gov-ernment and donors assist health centers in purchasinginexpensive generic drugs, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of services at the health center.The initiative is only five years old, but its achieve-ments are impressive. Eighteen African countries wereparticipating as of late 1991, and nearly 1,800 healthcenters located in 221 districts were part of the pro-gram. In Benin the first forty-four health centers tar-geted by the initiative are covering 42 to 46 percent oftheir operating costs with user charges, and in the firstseventeen centers in Guinea's program, user fees cover38 to 49 percent of expenditures. Utilization of healthcenters has increased. In Benin average monthly visitsto pilot health centers rose from 100 in 1987 to 250 in1989.Despite the initiative's promising accomplishments,it is not yet certain that the reforms can be sustained Ofla large scale. A number of health centers covered bythe initiative have received both financial and technicalassistance from UNICEF, WHO, and other donorsmore than $36 million has come from UNICEF alone.Problems may emerge when this external assistanceends, particularly in converting local revenues gener-ated through user charges into the foreign exchangeneeded to purchase imported drugs. In addition, ef-forts to encourage local private financing of health careby poor urban and rural households may allow govern-ments to avoid tackling basic reforms of their healthsystems, especially the reallocation of public revenuesfrom tertiary care hospitals to more basic services. GNP.) Some countries are already moving in thisdirection. Mozambique, for example, is increasinggovernment outlays for health in 1992 and 1993 aspart of a broader program of economic reform, andMauritania is committed to substantial rises ingovernment health spending during 1992-96.Since shifts in domestic budget resources betweensectors take several years to implement, donorfunds could play a significant role in increasinggovernment health expenditures, including recur-rent spending, in the early years. The budget re-forms in both Mozambique and Mauritania are be-ing supported by transitional financing from thedonor community. REDUCTION OF WASTE AND INEFFICIENCY. There issubstantial scope for reduction of waste and ineffi-ciency in government health programs, especiallyin drug management. Pharmaceuticals, which ac-count for 10 to 30 percent of public spending forhealth in most countries, are the most promisingarea for efficiency gains in the short run. Verylarge savings can be achieved by improving theselection and quantification of drug requirements,in part through the use of essential national druglists, and by purchasing drugs competitively. Nu-merous successes have already been recorded.Bulk procurement of drugs enabled a group ofchurch-run African health associations to save 40percent of their annual drug bill. Similar efforts byseveral Caribbean states led to an average reduc-tion of 44 percent in the price paid for the twenty-five most frequently used drugs. An essential-drugs revolving fund for several Central Americannations yielded savings of 65 percent of the costsof pharmaceuticals. COMMUNITY CONTROL AND FINANCING. Com-munity financing, in the form of user charges andprepaid insurance schemes, has become a practicalnecessity in a number of low-income countries.But community financing is also a virtuous neces-sity: it can help to improve the quality and re-liability of services, in part by making healthworkers more accountable to their clienteles.This is the approach being taken in the BamakoInitiative, sponsored by WHO and UNICEF (Box7.1). Recent experience from a number of African159countries shows that rural households are pre-pared to pay modest charges for drugs in govern-ment health centers, provided that the quality ofservices improves, that fees are retained and uti-lized at the point of service, and that the localpopulation has a strong voice in the operation ofthe facility. In Guinea, for example, about half ofthe country's 350 health centers were practicingcommunity financing in 1991. Of these, all the ur-ban-based facilities and a third of the rural clinicswere able to cover their operating expenses withincome from fees. Governments should act cau-tiously, however. Experience suggests that feessubstantial enough to cover the full cost of clinicalservices can discourage utilization by the poor.Under these circumstances, the poor should becharged reduced fees or should be exempted frompayment.PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS. Health policy re-forms face formidable obstacles in low-income de-veloping countries. The health ministry oftenmakes only a weak case for a larger share of the(sometimes shrinking) budget. Politicians, doc-tors, and the urban population exert strong pres-sures for higher spending on tertiary care facilitiesin the major metropolitan areas at the expense ofthe district health infrastructure. Professional as-sociations and trade unions representing doctorsand nurses strongly resist both staff cuts designedto increase nonsalary spending and efforts to re-deploy health workers to rural areas. Despite theseobstacles, some low-income countries are cur-rently carrying out major health policy reforms.Malawi, for example, is implementing sweepingchanges as part of a World Bank project. It is in-creasing the share of the government budget allo-cated to health from 7.1 percent in 1991 to 9.1 per-cent by 1995,raising the fractionof healthspending for district health services from 15 to 23percent, and reducing the share devoted to thecountry's three central hospitals from 35 to 25 per-cent. To strengthen the district health system, thegovernment is also engaging more than 3,500 newlower-level health workers to serve in rural clinicsand communities. Donor funds are being used tohelp pay for these workers.Middle-income countriesIn middle-income developing countries out-of-pocket payments for health usually account forless than a third of total spending. Some middle-income countries, such as South Africa and Zim-babwe, have private insurance, even though most 160of the population receives servicesfinancedthrough general tax revenues. Other countries usesocial insurance, with part of the population cov-ered by mandatory employment-based contribu-tions, usually pooled in a single fund run by aparastatal agency. The share of the population pro-tected by social insurance varies widely, from lessthan 10 percent in the Dominican Republic, Ecua-dor, and El Salvador to more than 80 percent inBrazil, Costa Rica, and Cuba. Brazil and Chile em-ploy hybrids of private and public insurance. InBrazil every citizen is legally entitled to servicesfinanced from a combination of general revenuesand social security contributions, and social insur-ance is deducted from the wages of every salariedworker. Yet more than one-fifth of the country'spopulation currently opts for some form of privateinsurance coverage.Middle-income countries need to focus on atleast four key areas of policy reform: phasing outpublic subsidies to better-off groups; extending in-surance coverage widely; giving consumersa choice of insurer; and encouraging paymentmethods that control costs. REDUCTION OF SUBSIDIES TO BETFER-OFF GROUPS.Governments should reduce and eventually elimi-nate public subsidies to relatively affluent groups.This can be done by charging full-cost fees to in-sured persons who use government hospitals andclinics for services not included in the national es-sential clinical package and by cutting tax deduc-tions for insurance contributions. In South Africaand Zimbabwe privately insured individuals havebeen charged less than the full cost of the servicesthey receive in government health facilities. In ad-dition, they have been allowed to deduct from tax-able income part or all of their out-of-pocket pay-ments for health care, as well as their healthinsurance premiums. Employers can also deducttheir insurance contributions. These measures re-duce the amounts available for financing essentialservices. In South Africa individual tax deductionswere estimated to be equivalent to 18 percent oftotal public sector health expenditures in 1990. In arecent effort to reverse a similar situation, Zim-babwe has sharply limited tax deductions forhealth care and insurance, raised fees, and inten-sified efforts to collect fees from privately insuredpatients. Government hospitals have learned thatthey can often identify insured patients by offeringthem extra nonmedical amenities, such as privatehospital rooms, and can then target them for ag-gressive cost recovery if they accept.In countries where social insurance covers onlya fraction of the population, governments can in-crease the extent to which health services are self-financing by eliminating public subsidies to socialinsurance. These subsidies, which are widespreadin Latin America, mostly benefit the middle classesand are therefore regressive. Elimination of thesubsidies would free resources for health servicesfor the poor. Eliminating subsidies also imposesmore financial discipline on the social insuranceagencies, which are often allowed to run deficitsthat are later covered by transfers from other socialsecurity programs or from the general governmentbudget. In Venezuela, for example, the govern-ment subsidizes contributions to the medical assis-tance fund within the parastatal social securityagency. Despite this subsidy, in 1990 the fund rana deficit equivalent to 37 percent of its healthexpenditures. EXTENSION OF INSURANCE. Where the bulk of thelabor force is already employed, government poli-cies that extend insurance coverage to the rest ofthe populationincluding the self-employed, theelderly, and the poorremove the inequities in-herent in multitiered systems of health financingand expand the content of the universally availablepackage of care. When insurance coverage be-comes universal, as in Costa Rica and Korea, sub-sidies actually end up targeting the poor and arethus progressive. But only a few middle-incomecountries that have adequate financial resources,political resolve, and administrative capacity willbe able to achieve such universal insurance cover-age. Korea's bold initiative to create a nationalhealth insurance system from scratch between1978 and 1989 and Costa Rica's efforts in the 1980sto universalize a system that had previously cov-ered only the industrial labor force show that thisis a difficult but achievable goal. Attaining univer-sal coverage would be more feasible if govern-ments limited the essential package of insured ser-vices to those with high cost-effectiveness.CONSUMER CHOICE. Competition among sup-pliers of a clearly specified prepaid package ofhealth services would improve quality and encour-age efficiency. And even where there is little or nodirect competition among insurance funds, as inJapan and Korea, multiple semi-independent in-surance institutions may still have advantagesover a single large parastatal agency. Local insur-ance funds managed by boards composed of rep-resentatives of workers, employers, and localgovernment, as in Germany, tend to be more ac-countable to their members. In a number of LatinAmerican countries monolithic social security \"in-stitutes\" are already heavily discredited because oftheir past inefficiencies and corruption. Greatercompetition and accountability are two of the mainobjectives of current proposals for reforming socialinsurance in Argentina.COST CONTAINMENT. Copayment by insured in-dividuals for some services can help to restraintheir use of the services but is unlikely to be a verypowerful cost-containment method. Copaymentsamounting to an average 40 percent of expendi-tures in Korea have done little to slow the rate ofincrease in health spending, which grew from 3.7to 6.6 percent of GNP during the 1980s. Similarly,the practice, introduced by private U.S. insurers,of retrospective reviews of utilization of medicalcare appears to lead to a modest one-time savingsin health spending but does not have long-lastingeffects on the rate of growth of expenditures.By contrast, prepayment of health care pro-viders is a promising approach to containinghealth expenditures. Governments could help topromote such schemes by removing legal barriersthat in many countries prevent the same institu-tion from acting as both insurer and provider. InSouth Africa the government recently decided toallow the creation of health maintenance Organiza-tions (HMO5), mainly as a way of containinghealth costs. More than twenty such organizationshave been established in just a few years. Theyhave introduced capitation and negotiated fees,which limit costs more effectively than did theopen-ended fee-for-service payment arrangementshistorically used in South Africa.Governments can do much to improve the in-centives created by social insurance. Where the in-sured use private providers, fee-for-service pay-ment schemes need to be replaced with analternativecapitation or annually negotiated uni-form fees for doctors and hospitals (based on diag-nostic-related groups of procedures, for example)or preset overall budgets for hospitals. Where so-cial insurance covers services by government hos-pitals, competition with the private sector can im-prove performance. Other promising approachesare to allow government hospitals to compete withone another as semiautonomous enterprises, as inthe United Kingdom in recent years, and to givehospital managers financial and career incentivesto meet performance targets, as in Chile.The example of Chile (Box 7.2) illustrates the 161benefits and perils of health sector reform in a mid-dle-income country. Chile has been able to im-prove efficiency, quality of care, and consumerchoice, but the reforms have also created newproblems regarding administration, financing, andequity.Formerly socialist countriesHistorically, the government was responsible forboth the finance and the delivery of health care inthe formerly socialist countries of Eastern Europeand the Soviet Union. Health expenditures werefinanced from general revenues. In principle, theywere provided free of cost to the population atgovernment clinics and hospitals and at facilitiesrun by state enterprises, but in practice, \"infor-mal\" payments oiled the wheels of bureaucracy.Today the health systems in these countries are insevere crisis. Many doctors and pharmacists areleaving the government health services to practice Box 7.2Health sector reforms in ChileOver the past fifteen years Chile has undertaken dra-matic reforms of its health sector, Its experience showsthat reform is a permanent process, not a one-time ef-fort, and that countries undertaking reform must haveboth the capacity and the political will to review andrevise health policies continuously.Starting in the late 1970s, Chile (then under a mili-tary government) decentralized the government-runhealth system and created private health insurance in-stitutions. Responsibility for operating primary careservices was devolved to the country's 325 munici-palities. The Ministry of Health transferred its primarycare budget and about half of its personnel to the mu-nicipalities, which could also draw for financing on lo-cal tax revenues and on resources from the central gov-ernment's Municipal Common Fund. More important,the government encouraged the establishment of pri-vately owned and operated health insurance funds,known as ISAPREs. The roughly 70 percent of thepopulation covered by social security schemes had theoption of using their payroll deduction to buy a pre-paid private health plan. The competing plans wereregulated by a new oversight unit (superintendencia) inthe Ministry of Health. By 1990 about 2.5 million peo-ple, or 18 percent of the population, were covered bythirty-five ISAPREs.Both decentralization and the creation of the privateinsurers brought about some improvements in thehealth system. The municipalities expanded primarycare services. The ISAPREs introduced more competi-tion and consumer choice into the financing and deliv-ery of services and spurred growth in the numbers ofprivate doctors and hospitals.But the reforms also created new problems. In theearly years of the reforms, when local officials wereappointed by the military regime, municipal health ser-vices were not responsive to the local population.Transfers of Ministry of Health staff to the munici-palities created job insecurity and caused a decline instaff morale. Many municipalities lacked the capacityto plan and manage primary health services. The mu-nicipalities tended to overrefer patients to hospitals,which were still funded by the ministry. The ministryhad few incentivestohelpsupervise municipalfacilities.Because municipalities were reimbursed for eachunit of service delivered, they tended to provide toomuch high-cost curative care and too few preventiveservices, which caused costs to explode. The govern-ment then moved to cap allocations to local authorities,using as a basis historical budget shares that favoredthe wealthier municipalities.The ISAPREs, by targeting the richest segments ofChilean society, impoverished the rest of the social in-surance system. Each salaried beneficiary who chose toshift to an ISAPRE cost the public system 2.5 times thecontribution of an average salaried worker. Because theISAPREs are permitted to rate individual health risks,they have \"skimmed\" the population for good risks,leaving the public sector to care for the sick and theelderly.The democratically elected government that came topower in 1989 has chosen to maintain the broad thrustof the health reforms while seeking ways to overcometheir adverse effects. Municipal elections have beenheld to ensure that popularly chosen and accountableofficials look after primary health services. Trainingprograms have been organized for municipal healthofficers. Responsibility for hospitals is being decentral-ized to twenty-seven health service areas that will enterinto management contracts with the Ministry ofHealth. Finally, under a new proposal, central fundswould be allocated to the municipalities on a capitationbasis, with a further adjustment to favor the poorestlocalities.The government is also beginning to look at ways toreduce inequities in the ISAPRE health financing sys-tem. The superintendencia that regulates ISAPRE is be-ing strengthened. Itis considering requiring the pri-vate plans to use community risk-rating and to acceptall applicants able to pay the community-rated pre-miums; making it mandatory for all ISAPREs to offer asimilar basic medical plan in order to promote directcompetition among suppliers (as in the managed caresystems being developed in the United States); andeliminating the deduction for employer contributions. 162fee-for-service medicine in the private sector. Sincereal government spending for health has fallendramatically during the recent transition toward amarket economy, the government health system isalso experiencing serious shortages of drugs andequipment.Largely because they know all too well the prob-lems of repressive central government control,policymakers, medical professionals, and con-sumers in the formerly socialist countries are look-ing to systems of public and private insurance inindustrial countries as possible models for reform.Some countriesfor example, the Czech Republic,Hungary, and Polandhave much in commonwith upper-middle-income countries such as Ar-gentina, Costa Rica, and Korea. They may be alsoable to adapt some features of the systems of theNordic countries and the United Kingdom, whichare financed from general revenues, or of the uni-versal social insurance approaches of Germanyand Japan. Others in this groupincluding therelatively poor Central Asian republicsface manyof the same issues currently confronting lower-middle-income and even low-income countries,such as Pakistan and Yemen.Despite this diversity, the governments of all theformerly socialist countries need to consider healthsector reforms in at least three main areas: improv-ing the efficiency of government health facilitiesand services, partly by reducing the size of thepublic system; finding new ways to finance healthcare; and encouraging private supply of healthservices while strengthening public regulatorycapacity. EFFICIENCYOFGOVERNMENTSERVICES. De-centralization of government health services is po-tentially the most important force for improvingefficiency and responding to local health condi-tions and demands. It will be successful only whenlocal government health agencies and hospitalshave a sound financial base, solid administrativecapacity, and incentives for improving efficiencyand when they are accountable to patients and lo-cal citizens. Extreme and hasty decentralizationcan create inefficiencies. In Poland, for example,the government has decentralized health caretothe level of the country's forty-nine provinces. Theaverage provincial population of less than a mil-lion is proving too small to make efficient use ofthe tertiary care hospitals being built in each pro-vince, and the available medical personnel are be-ing spread too thin. For these reasons, the govern-ment is now experimenting with health regionscovering two to four provinces, but the provincesare reluctant to finance such regions. Moreover,there are political pressures for further decentral-ization to the level of the district governments,where there is now very little capacity for manag-ing health systems.At the same time that they decentralize, govern-ments will have to reduce the size of publiclyowned health services, which have far too manyhospitals, hospital beds, and physicians. In thisway, governments can free resources for vital pub-lic health services, including immunization, work-place and food safety, environmental regulation,measures such as education and higher taxes todiscourage consumption of alcohol and tobacco,and quality control of privately delivered clinicalcare. The clinical and managerial skills of the re-maining government health personnel need to besubstantially upgraded and reoriented from theprevious system of centralized bureaucratic con-troltowardtheemerging systemofsemi-autonomous health facilities.NEw MODES OF FINANCING. The examples ofother countries could help the formerly socialistcountries establish insurance systems that pre-serve the main virtue of their old systemwide-spread coverage of the population. It could alsohelp them to recognize the circumstances underwhich general government revenues can play apositive role, as the dominant source of funding(the pattern in the United Kingdom) or as a com-plement to insurance (as in Japan). Experienceelsewhere offers important lessons on how to cre-ate financing systems that are sustainable and thatcontain costs by, for example, discouraging fee-for-service compensation. The formerly socialistcountries will also want to avoid the large and in-equitable government subsidies commonly pro-vided to private insurance for the wealthy or tosocial insurance for the middle class.Most formerly socialist countries are already onthe road to reform. The Czech and Slovak repub-lics and Hungary are experimenting with forms ofsocial insurance. Because the Czech system in-cluded a very comprehensive package of healthbenefits and paid private doctors on a fee-for-ser-vice basis, it encountered serious financial diff i-culties after just a few months of operation. Underthe recently revised Hungarian health-financingsystem, public sector doctors will be salaried em-ployees of the central and local governments, andprivate general practitioners will be paid on a cap-itation basis. Russia and Ukraine are also prepar- 163Box 7.3Reform of the Russian health systemBefore the political upheavals of 1990-91 that led to thebreakup of the Soviet Union, the 3 to 4 percent of GNPthat the Russian republic spent on health care for itsnearly 150 million inhabitants was financed from gen-eral government revenues and delivered through avast network of public facilities, programs, and em-ployees. This highly centralized and bureaucratic sys-tem led to excessive numbers of doctors and hospitals.It gave few incentives for efficiency or for providingquality care, and it neglected the preventive measuresneeded to combat the country's most serious environ-mental and behavioral problems: industrial pollution,alcohol and tobacco dependency, and poor nutrition.Consequently, the health status of Russians stagnatedduring the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990 life expectancy forRussian men was just sixty-four years, a full ten yearsless than in Western Europe, and the infant mortalityrate, at twenty-two per 1,000 live births, was twice theWestern European average.The new Russian government has pursued severalfundamental reforms of the old Soviet health system.Health financing and management are being decentral-ized to eighty-eight regions. Much medical practice isbeing privatized, and a recent health insurance lawprovides for the introduction and regulation of newforms of insurance. Under the law and its proposedamendments, each region is to have a social insurancefund, and a national fund will equalize resourcesacross regions. These insurance funds will receive acombination of compulsory payroll deductions andbudget transfers from general government revenues.They will sign contracts for care with public and privateproviders. Individuals can then voluntarily purchasesupplementary private insurance to cover additionalhealth services.The health insurance legislation has been in effectsince late 1991, but progress in implementing it hasbeen slow. Some important issues in the design of thesystem still need to be resolved. These include the roleand extent of competition among public and privateinsurers; whether risks are to be rated on an individualbasis or across larger pools of individuals; and how theinsurance funds will pay providerson a fee-for-ser-vice basis, through capitation,or by some othermethod or combination of methods.The practical obstacles to the implementation of thenew system are formidable, partly because of the un-settled administrative and economic environment. Theregional governments lack the capacity to manage andregulate the health system they are inheriting. Theeconomy and the government budget are under severestrain. Real wages have fallen dramatically in the pastfew years. The costs of drugs and equipment have in-creased faster than inflation, leading to serious short-ages. Payroll taxes to cover employee benefits alreadyabsorb 38 percent of wages, making it difficult to fi-nance an affordable package of health services throughthe social insurance system. To help overcome theseproblems, a number of international agencies, includ-ing the World Bank, are working closely with Russianhealth officials on designing and carrying out healthpolicy reforms. ing to implement mixed systems of social insur-ance and general revenue financing. Box 7.3describes the current efforts in Russia. COMPETITIVE PROVISION AND PUBLIC REGULATION.Although private medical practice is now permit-ted in most of the formerly socialist countries, thelegal and regulatory environment for private doc-tors, hospitals, and insurance institutions is ofteneither nonexistent or hostile. With large numbersof private doctors establishing practices and pri-vate hospitals and clinics being created, regulationof providers will be critical for reducing the inci-dence of medical malpractice and financial fraud:It is also essential that regulation encourage thedevelopment of efficientinstitutions,such ashealth maintenance organizations, for financingand providing clinical care for the bulk of thepopulation. Already there are signs of poorly con-ceived regulations, such as Romania's recent deci- 164sion to issue lifetime licenses to doctors withoutestablishing strict standards of practice or recer-tification requirements. Since government regula-tory capacity is likely to be weak in the next fewyears, health system reforms should be designedin ways that minimize the need for direct govern-mentregulation.Encouragingself-regulationthrough associations of private medical schools,doctors, and hospitals would be one such ap-proach. In the long run, better regulation will re-quire both training of government inspectors andother regulatory personnel and development ofgovernment institutions such as medical licensingboards and national and local medical ethicscommittees. Directions and prospects for reformThe world's diversity of health care systems ismatched by the diversity of reform movements.But several common themes are beginning toemerge. First, governments are increasingly recog-nizing the centrality of their own role in publichealthfor example, in achieving the enormousglobal gains in immunization coverage. Second,governments are exploring ways to introducemore competition and foster a diversity of publicand private institutions in the delivery of clinicalservices. Third, governments are examining newapproaches to finance and insurance, including se- lective user fees in the public sector, systems thatdiscourage third-party reimbursement, systemsthat mix finance from compulsory social insuranceand from general tax revenues, and systems that set fixed budgets for each patient or each case.Everywhere, health sector reform is a contin-uous and complex struggle. Neither governments nor free markets can by themselves allocate re- sources for health efficiently. As policymakers try to reach compromises, they must deal with power- ful interest groups (private doctors, drug com- panies, medical equipment manufacturers, andinsurers) and strong political constituencies, in-cluding urban dwellers and industrial workers.Strategies for overcoming these obstacles tohealth sector reform will vary from country tocountry, but some common approaches are dis- cernible. Political leadership, beginning with thehead of state, is an indispensable element in re-form programs almost everywhere. The 1990 World Summit for Children proved an effective means for engaging the attention and commitment of heads of state (see Box 2 in the Overview). Se- nior officials of ministries of health can be strongly influenced by the prevailing views of the interna-tional health community, particularly those of WHO and other major donors, and by participa-tion in international meetings and seminars onhealth policy and management.Professional associations may be able to bringabout some reorientation of health workers, espe-cially physicians. Appeals to the sense of social responsibility of these associations have helped advance agendas for preventive health in the United States and elsewhere. Such groups, how- ever, are often the sources of the strongest resis- tance to change. Reshaping the training curriculaof medical and nursing schools to include a greateremphasis on public health and general practice islikely to be a more effective way to enlist the sup-port of physicians and nurses.Public opinion can be a powerful force for healthreform, not only in industrial countries but also in developingcountriessuchasBrazil,Chile,Nigeria, and South Africa and in Eastern Europe.A free press is important, as are consumer advo-cacy groups, for conveying a diversity of views on health reform and for stimulating debate.In many countries, maintaining the support ofthe middle class and of urban groups for healthpolicy reformsincluding the reallocation of pub-lic spending from tertiary care to basic publichealth and clinical care for the poorwill require agradual shift in resources rather than wholesalechanges in just one or two years. For this reason,universal government financing (or government- mandated financing) for a nationally defined es-sential package of services will often be more suc-cessful than a highly targeted approach that mayundermine the political base for reform. Similarly,continued government ownership of some hospi-tals that offer high-quality tertiary care, with aphased reduction in public subsidies to the wealthy for this care, may be more feasible politi-cally than rapid divestiture to the private sector.External financial assistance can help countrieshandle these politically difficult tradeoffs and canease the process of policy change.International assistance for healthAfter growing rapidly in the 1970s, aid for healthstagnated during the 1980s. As a share of officialdevelopment assistance, aid for health declinedfrom an average of 7 percent for the period 198 1-85to 6 percent during 1986-90. Total aid flows to thehealth sector in 1990 were $4.8 billionalmost $4billion in official development assistance and $0.8 billion from NGOs and foundations (Figure 7.1). This amounts to about one dollar per person in developing countries. (The figure for official devel-opment assistance is based on reports from donor governments. Only $3.3 billion of the $4 billion canbe accounted for as receipts by individual coun-tries; this is the amount that appears in the total health expenditure estimated in Chapter 3 and inAppendix table A.9.) Bilateral agencies accountedfor the largest share (40 percent), followed byUnited Nations agencies (33 percent), NGOs (17percent), development banks (8 percent), and foundations (2 percent).The trend is for donors to provide aid for healththrough multilateral channels. The share of multi-lateral assistance has grown from 25 percent in 1980 to 40 percent in 1990 and is likely to exceed 50percent by 1995. As a result of the quadrupling ofWorld Bank lending for health over the past sixyears, disbursements of Bank funds are expected 165External assistance to developing countries for health comes from many sources, public and private. Figure 7.1 Disbursements of external assistance for the health sector, 1990(millions of dollars)I/3,925 Publicagencies 869 Privateagencies a. Includes $350 million in 1992 to about $1billion in 1995, making the World Bank the largestsingle source of external funding for health. Sincethe portion of aid going to middle-income coun-tries from the World Bank and other developmentbanks is nonconcessional lending, some of theprojected increase in lending for health will in-volve a hardening of terms. It would be desirablefor bilateral grant-funding agencies and conces-sional arms of the development banks (such as theWorld Bank's International Development Associa-tion) to increase their assistance to health as well.The amount of health aid has stagnated, and itsshare in total development assistance has de-clined, even as donors continue to express concernabout health. Over the past ten years the UnitedNations and other international agencies havecalled for increased investments in the develop-ment of human resources, including health, bothby developing countries themselves and by the do-nor community. The United Nations Development166Programme (UNDP), in its annual Human Develop-ment Report, has argued for more donor spendingon health, and in its recent World Development Re-ports the World Bank has made similar recommen-dations. World Development Report 1990 proposed a3 percent annual increase in aid during the 1990s,to be targeted at poverty-reducing activities, in-cluding basic health care. The donor communityneeds to review these goals and targets in light ofthe actual trends in aid flows for health.The share of aid going to health should be re-stored immediately to its earlier level of 7 percentof total official development assistance and shouldrise substantially over the next five years. Such anincrease would have a significant impact on thehealth status of the poor, particularly if it is di-rected toward the transitional costs of reallocatinggovernment spending to public health measuresand essential clinical care and to seriously under-funded disease control efforts such as those fortuberculosis and AIDS. A rise in donor assistanceN382/4,794 Donorcountries4,794 DevelopingCOO 0 tries Kof $2 billion, for example, could finance a quarterof the estimated additional costs of a basic packagein low-income countries and of strengthened ef-forts to prevent AIDS. Such an increase, whichwould boost from 6 to 9 percent the share of totalofficial aid going to health, would be feasible ifother donors matched the rise in World Bank dis-bursements for health that is expected to occur incoming years. It would also be consistent with theproposal in the UNDP's Human Development Report1993 (also endorsed by UNICEF) that 20 percent ofaid be spent on health, education, water and sani-tation,and environmental protection fortheworld's poor.There are a number of ways, in addition to thetraditional annual and multiyear programming ofaid by individual donors, for the internationalcommunity to mobilize more financial resourcesfor health. Coordinated sectorwide pledging atconsultative group meetings and donor round-tables has been used successfully in countries suchas Tanzania and Zambia. Another approach is pro-gram-specific pledging,asillustrated by thedozens of national AIDS-control donor meetingschaired by WHO in recent years. The role of debt-for-development swaps as a means of generatingextra resources for both government and NGO-provided health services should be assessed in thiscontext. Ecuador, Sudan, and Zimbabwe have al-ready carried out swaps, and Nigeria is exploring amajor swap of its debt currently held by donors inreturn for increased public spending for essentialhealth services.Improving the effectiveness of aid for healthIt is crucial that the donor community and devel-oping countries focus on ways to improve the ef-fectiveness of existing and future assistance to thehealth sector, particularly in the low-income coun-tries where donor assistance already accounts for a Table 7.2 Official development assistancefor health by demographic region, 1990 Source: Michaud and Murray, background paper.large share of health expenditure. In Africa aidmakes up an average 10 percent of national healthspending (Table 7.2), or 20 percent if South Africais excluded. Aid covers more than half of all healthexpenditures in countries such as Burkina Faso,Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Tan-zania. In these countries donors finance an impor-tant share of recurrent costs, as well as investmentitems. In Mozambique, for example, aid accountedfor more than half of recurrent spending in 1991and for 90 percent of capital expenditures forhealth. Even when aid amounts to 2 percent or lessof total health spending, as in the other develop-ing regions, improvements in its use would still bean important catalyst for reform.General lessons on improving aid effectivenessapply equally to the health sector (Box 7.4). Do-nors need to set their priorities carefully and allo-cate their resources in accordance with these prior-ities. The productivity of aid would increasesubstantially if donors were to direct more of theirassistance to public health measures and essentialclinical services, especially in low-income coun-tries. They might also usefully focus on capacitybuilding, research, and reform of health policy.Countries that show a willingness to improve ac-cess to health services for the poor and to under-take reforms of the health system should be strongcandidates for aid.The World Bank increasingly stresses policy re-form in its lending for health, which has grownnearly fourfold in recent years (Box 7.5). For somedonors, adjustment of priorities would meanspending less on hospitals, sophisticated medicalequipment, and training for medical specialistsDuring 1988-90 Japan spent more than 33 percentof its bilateral assistance for health on constructionof hospitals, France spent 25 percent, and Ger-many and Italy spent nearly 15 percent each.Within the domain of public health and essentialclinical care, several areas of intervention deservegreater attention from donors, including tuber-culosis control, the EPI Plus program, micro-nutrient supplementation, AIDS prevention andcontrol, and programs to reduce tobacco consump-tion. These problems impose a large burden of ill-ness, in some cases because rapid growth of thethreat has gone unrecognized. Their control offerslarge externalities or economies of scale. Often, so-lutions will require a global effort.The efficiency of aid for health can be greatlyenhanced through better coordination of donorprojects and policies. Fragmentation of externalsupport in the health sector is a long-standingproblem in many countries and imposes Eastern crescent 4531.311.3India 2860.341.6China 770.070.6rBox 7.4Health assistance and the effectiveness of aidRecent evaluations of the effectiveness of aid, includ-ing a classic 1986 study commissioned by the worlddonor community, point toward the same conclusion:most aid has been successful, but a considerable share,perhaps a third or more, has been much less so, and asmall percentage has failed completely or has evenbeen harmful. These broad-brush averages hide signifi-cant regional differences: in Asia and Latin Americaperformance has been better; in Sub-Saharan Africa ithas been worse. Aid has been least effective in thepoorest countries, where success is most needed.The reasons for inferior performance lie with bothdonors and recipients. Poor countries and those experi-encing political conflict and instability constitute a diffi-cult environment for aid, as they have little administra-tive capacity or infrastructure. But these difficultieshave in many cases been compounded by unfortunatepolicies. Aid projects have been poorly designed, bothtechnically and because of inadequate understandingof the human, social, institutional, and political envi-ronment. When it comes to coordination, both sideshave been at fault. Donors have pursued their OWflobjectives without attempting to ensure that their aidcomplements that of others. And all too often, aid re-cipients have played one donor off against another,while ministers and ministries have focused on theirown concerns rather than looking to the national good.Aid for health has generally had a good technicalrecord. It has fit in well with development priorities,especially in recent years, as the concentration on hos-pitals and high-technology curative medicine has beenreplaced by an emphasis on primary and preventivecare. There have also been major successes_mainlyhighly focused initiatives such as the program for theeradication of smallpox, the drive against child mortal-ity, and the effort to control river blindness in Africa.What is still lacking is the ability of the aid system tohelp set in place and sustain locally appropriate publichealth programs and essential clinical services. burden on already overextended government offi-cials. In the extreme, fragmentation can lead toconflicting policies being put into effect. Recentlyin one West African country, for example, threedifferent cost recovery policies, each sponsored bya different donor agency, were being applied inseparate regions of the country. The dangers offragmentation are especially great in poor coun-tries where different donors choose to focus theirhealth sector activities on different provinces ordistricts and either lose sight of or undermine theformulation of national policies.Much can be done to improve donor coordina-tion, globally and regionally, but especially at thecountry level. Donors can agree with countries onoverall national health and assistance strategies.This is especially effective when the governmenttakes the lead in planning and in coordinating thedonors, as has happened recently in Zimbabwe.Another approach is for donors to form large con-sortia to fund national programs, as in the case ofmaternal and child health and family planning inBangladesh. (The experiences of these two coun-tries are reviewed in Box 7.6.) At a minimum, do-nors should create informal local groups that meetperiodically to review progress and problems inthe health sector, as in Mozambique and Senegal.The efficiency with which aid for health is spentdepends critically on building local capacity toplan and manage health systems. This requires 168strengthening the public institutions that financeand deliver health services, both through broadcivil service reform and through changes withinthe health sector. Donors can play an importantrole in these areas by supporting decentralizationand other organizational reforms and by assistingthe groups that formulate national health policies.Additional support is required for initiatives suchas the foundation-backed International Health Pol-icy Program and for bilateral projects to trainhealth planners and managers, economists, andsociologists.International programs for research and development inhealthInvestments in health research and developmenthave yielded high returns in better health. For ex-ample, the programs for tropical disease researchand human reproduction funded by donors andexecuted by WHO have produced a number ofnew or improved drugs and diagnostic tests andhave strengthened research capacity in developingcountries. Yet according to the 1990 report of theCommission on Health Research for Develop-ment, only 5 percent of global expenditures onhealth research are directed at the health problemsunique to developing countries, and less than 10percent of donor assistance for health is devoted toresearch,both biomedical and inthesocialsciences.The commission identified several serious defi-ciencies in the international health research anddevelopment system. The expertise of the globalpharmaceutical industry is not being adequatelyapplied to the development of drugs and vaccinesthat could reduce the toll of early childhood dis-eases. Technology assessment is weak, as is thehealth policy research needed to determine moreequitable and efficient ways to finance and deliverhealth services. Most important, the commissionnoted, local research capacity in developing coun-tries is woefully inadequate. A number of promis-ing research efforts, including the Children's Vac-cine Initiative and programs to deal with acuterespiratory infections, tuberculosis, micronutrientdeficiencies and worm infections, suffer fromweak and uncertain donor funding. In general, theproblems of constrained funding for research arecompounded by donors' limited capacity to stayabreast of the latest research proposals and toassess therelativeprioritiesfor funding thisresearch.To help stabilize funding, to improve the settingof priorities, and to boost efficiency, developingcountries, donors, and scientists should considerthe development of a global mechanism for bettercoordination of international health research. Anumber of institutional arrangements are possible,including well-defined networks of research cen-ters, informal consultative bodies, and large globalfunds that pool donor assistance. Examples ofthese institutional arrangements in other sectors,such as the Consultative Group for InternationalAgricultural Research and the Global EnvironmentFacility, may provide models for improving the co-ordination of international health research. Box 7.5World Bank support for reform of the health sectorWorld Bank support for the health sector has growndramatically over the past six years. The number ofnew World Bank-financed health, population, and nu-trition projects approved each year increased from anaverage of eight during fiscal 1987-89 to twenty-oneduring fiscal 1990-92, and the value of credits andloans committed each year rose from $317 million to$1,151 million over the same period. As of June 1992,eighty-one Bank-financed health projects were beingimplemented. As a share of new World Bank lending,projects for health, population, and nutrition grewfrom less than 1 percent in 1987 to nearly 7 percent in1991.Whereas most of these projects continue the Bank'straditional support for basic health servicesincludingdistrict health infrastructure and personnel, maternaland child health, and control of infectious diseasesWorld Bank lending for health is increasingly focusingon broad policy reforms in the health sector. For exam-ple, in connection with a recent Bank project, the gov-ernment of Maurifania has developed a financing planto improve the availability of basic health services forits widely dispersed population. The share of the gen-eral recurrent budget going to the Ministry of PublicHealth will increase from 5.5 percent in 1992 to 7.5percent in 1996. The project is introducing commurtity-based cost recovery in three of the country's thirteenregions as a way of improving the efficiency and qual-ity of services. Revenues are being raised mainlythrough the sale of drugs, organized and managed bylocal health communities.In Tunisia the government is carrying out compre-hensive reforms, including granting greater manage-ment autonomy to health facilities and decentralizingresources to the regional level. Doctors, nurses, andother health personnel are being encouraged to workin better-equipped health centers and other basic facili-ties. And health-financing mechanisms are being re-vised, with updated fee schedules, new exemptionprocedures for the poor, and changes to the healthbenefits covered by existing insurance schemes. TheHospital Restructuring Project, supported by theWorld Bank, is assisting the improvement of manage-ment systems and the quality of health services in thelargest government hospitals, which were recentlygranted autonomous legal status. The project dovetailswith the concurrent World Bank-financed Populationand Family Health Project, designed to improve thequality and efficiency of public health services and es-sential clinical care, especially for mothers and chil-dren. It is expected that better basic services at thehealth center level will reduce the demand for hospitalcare, thus slowing the expansion of the country'shospitals.The Rumania Health Rehabilitation Project supportsgovernment efforts to diversify sources of health fi-nancing and thus to reduce dependence on the publicbudget, which is under pressure because of weak andunstable macroeconomic conditions and rising healthcare costs. The government is pilot testing decentral-ization of health sector policymaking, planning, man-agement, and evaluation in three subregions. It is alsodiscussing how to create a legal and regulatory envi-ronment to support reform of health financing. 169Box 7.6Donor coordination in the health sector in Zimbabwe and BangladeshThe Zimbabwe Second Family Health Project (1992-96)is the culmination of a long period of interaction be-tween the government of Zimbabwe, the World Bank,and other multilateral and bilateral donors. The $120million project, which supports the government's five-year investment program for population, health, andnutrition, is designed to benefit directly low-incomehouseholds, especially women and children. Zim-babwe has entered a period of economic adjustmentthat will necessitate spending Cuts. The project willhelp protect poor and vulnerable households fromsome adverse effects of adjustment by mobilizing addi-tional resources for human resource development andby improving the equity and efficiency of spending.Zimbabwean participation was emphasized from theproject's beginning. The project preparation committeeincluded representatives from various central govern-ment departments, provincial governments, and theZimbabwe National Family Planning Council. Thecommittee set planning guidelines, including a prelimi-nary outline of project components, costs, and financ-ing. Using these guidelines, proposals were preparedlocally and were then reviewed by the committee andby interested donors.Virtually all the major donors to the health sector inZimbabwe helped with planning the project by assign-ing agency officials and technical specialists to the do-nor team that advised the government on design is-sues. In the end, the project received financing fromDenmark,theEuropeanCommunity,Norway,Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank.Donors monitor project implementation jointly ratherthan separately, reducing the time needed for donorreviewandtheadministrativeburdenonthegovernment.In Bangladesh the World Bank and ten bilateral agen-cies together are contributing $440 million to the FourthPopulation and Health Project, and the government isproviding $165 million, for a total of $605 million overthe five-year project period. The United Nations Popu-lation Fund, WHO, and UNICEF are supplying projectmanagement, procurement, and technical assistance.All the partners in the project belong to the BangladeshPopulationandHealthConsortium,whichhasemerged as an important collective force in the healthsector. The Asian Development Bank has joined theconsortium with a view to ensuring consistency be-tween the project and its own $60 million investment inpopulation and health in Bangladesh.During project formulation the government and thedonors held several workshops in Dhaka and a specialconference in Geneva. These workshops were instru-mental in forging a consensus on population andhealth strategies. The consortium approach enables thegovernment and the donor community to agree on anoverall strategy and to work out a consistent financingplan for the sector. The consortium operates on thebasis of strict equality of all the partners, independentof the size of their financial contributions.In addition to strengthening Bangladesh's popula-tion program and its delivery system for family plan-ning services, the consortium is attempting to reorientthe health care system toward public health, includingmaternal health. It is also trying to make basic servicesmore easily accessible to the rural and urban poor. Meeting the challenges of health policy reformIf policymakers are to accelerate the substantialhealth gains of recent decades, especially for thepoor in developing countries, the agenda for re-form is clear. It includes increasing overall rates ofeconomic growth and expanding basic schooling,particularlyforgirls;reallocating governmentspending for health from tertiary care and special-ist training to public health measures and essentialclinical services; encouraging more diversity andcompetition in the provision of clinical care andthe development of cost-containing approaches toinsurance; increasing the efficiency of governmenthealth services; and fostering greater involvementof communities and households in promotinghealthier behavior on their own part and in man-aging their local health services. 170Policymakers in developing countries and off i-cials of the international donor community face anumber of difficult challenges in pursuing thisagenda. The changing demographic profile of thedeveloping world, including the aging of thepopulation, is creating new patterns of disease.Emerging microbial threats, such as AIDS anddrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and malaria,call for changes in personal behavior, new drugs,and new ways of delivering services effectively.In virtually every country interest groups willresist health policy reforms of the kind suggestedin this Report. Health workers will object tochanges that threaten their job security, incomelevels, and degree of professional autonomy. Drugcompanies, medical equipment manufacturers,and other suppliers will try to block policies thatthey see as having an adverse effect on their mar-kets, revenues, and profits. Political and economicelites and organized labor groups will seek to pre-serve existing public subsidies for insurance andhealth services from which they benefit and tomaintain their privileged access to clinical care.Beyond this, policymakers will have to wrestlewith the reality that in the area of health there is nosimple paradigm for policy choice. Free marketsfor public health activities and clinical care oftenfail, and when governments intervene in financingand delivery, as they frequently do, they can failjust as badly. Effective government regulation ofprivate suppliers of health services and inputs,combined with public financing of cost-effectivepackages of public health and essential clinical ser-vices, is needed to deal with these failures. But thisin turn requires strong private and public institu-tionsand institutional capacity is seriously lack-ing in many developing countries.Despite these obstacles, there have been a num-ber of successes in specific intervention programssuch as polio eradication and river blindness con-trol and a smaller but still important number ofsuccesses in broader health sector reform in suchcountries as Chile, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe, as wellas in many OECD countries. These successes nowneed to be multiplied, especially in the area of sec-tor reform, if countries are to address the acuteweaknesses in existing institutional structures andto lay the foundation for major improvements infuture living standards.Developing country governments need to domore to translate into practice today's rhetoricabout reallocating resources, improving access,and increasing efficiency. To do this, higher andsustained rates of macroeconomic growth are re-quired. In many cases countries will also need toenact fundamental political reforms designed toincrease participation and to improve the account-ability of governments for their health spending,service delivery, and regulatory performance.The donor community has a major responsibilityto back up with concrete actions its verbal commit-ment to poverty reduction and to investment inhealth and human resources. In particular, donorsshould do more to support the formulation of im-proved health policies and more effective healthsector reform programs in developing countries.As suggested in this Report, they can do this byfinancing some of the transitional costs of real-locating government budgets to public health mea-sures and essential clinical care, by building localplanning, management, and research capacity,and by providing sound assessments of the world-wide experience with the cost-effectiveness of in-terventions and with reform of systems.If developing country governments and donorsaccept the challenges and embrace the key healthpolicy reforms outlined above, improvements inhuman welfare in the coming years will be enor-mous. A large share of the current burden of dis-easeperhaps as much as one-quarterwill beprevented. And people around the world, espe-cially the more than 1 billion people now living inpoverty, will live longer, healthier, and more pro-ductive lives. 171Acknowledgments This Report benefited greatly from ideas, technicalinputs, and critical review from a broad range of indi-viduals and organizations.

The smallpox story isadapted from Fenner and others 1988. The discussionof the gains in worker productivity from better healthdraws on studies by Castro and Mokate 1988, Conly1975, Max and Shepard 1989, Nur and Mahran 1988,Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan 1990, Sagan and Afifi1979, Schultz and Tansel 1993, and Hill and others,background paper, as well as on helpful materialsprovided by John Caldwell, Gavin Jones, and JohnAnarfi. Anil Deolalikar provided additional materialon the economic impact of improved nutrition in In-dia, and John Akin made available unpublished noteson the relationship between health and income. Thecost-benefit calculations of malaria eradication in SriLanka are derived from Barlow and Grobar 1985.Aehyung Kim and Bruce Benton contributed to Box1.1.The discussion of the education benefits of im-proved health and the related economic benefits ofimproved education is based on studies by Behrmanand others 1991, Boissiere, Knight, and Sabot 1985,Glewwe 1991, Gomes-Neto and Hanushek 1991, Jam-ison and Leslie 1990, and Moock 1984, Nokesand others 1992, and Psacharopoulos 1993.The section on reduced costs of medical care drawson studies by Ainsworth and Over 1992, notes byDavid Bloom and Ajay Mahal on the implications ofreducing the rate of HIV transmission among Se-ropositive individuals (with additional personal com-munication from the authors) and Musgrove 1988.Martha Ainsworth and Mead Over drafted Box 1.2.Bloom and Lyons 1993 provide analyses pointing tothe economic gains associated with AIDS preventionin a number of Asian countries.The discussion of the impact of health investmentson poverty draws on the work of Henry Mosley andon World Bank 1980 and 1990a. The record of successdraws heavily on statistical publications of the UnitedNations (Demographic Yearbook, various years) and thWorld Health Organization (Statistics Annual, variousyears). Ingram 1992 discusses the greater conver-gence of social (including health) indicators than ofincome across countries.Child mortality estimates are derived in part fromUnited Nations 1988 but were mostly calculated fromdata in United Nations 1992 as part of a joint WorldBank-UNICEF exercise to be used in UNICEF forth-coming and described in Hill and Yazbeck, back-ground paper. Eduard Bos and My Vu of the WorldBank's Population, Health and Nutrition Departmentprovided invaluable assistance and advice with thebase regional population projections underlyingmuch of Chapter 1 and Appendix A. Mortality as-sumptions were updated and revised in the light ofdiscussions with Larry Heligman of the United Na-tions Population Division, Gareth Jones of UNICEF,and recent data from the Demographic and HealthSurveys program provided by Ties Boerma or extrac-ted from recent reports. Nicholas Eberstadt contrib-uted useful ideas on mortality differentials in adult-hood,and thesectionfurtherbenefitedfromFeachem and others 1992.The results in the section on the global burden ofdisease are taken from a joint World Bank-WorldHealth Organization study (Murray and Lopez back-ground paper); many collaborators are listed in Ap-pendix B. Material on measuring the burden of dis-ease for Ghana, to establish health care priorities,came from Ghana Health Assessment Project Team1981. Feachem 1988 stresses the importance of \"mac-roepidemiology\" for health planning.The section on challenges for the future is based onInstitute of Medicine 1992, Mackay 1993, and WHO1992b and 1992c and on information on HIV andAIDS provided by Seth Berkley, Rand Stoneburner,and WHO staff. D. A. Henderson provided informa-tion on emerging microbial infections; Tore Godal,Tekle Haimanot, and D. Lopez and Neil Collishaw on smoking.Jacobs and others 1993 report on the development ofa test for drug resistance in tuberculosis.The discussion on demographic and epidemiologictransition draws on studies by Bobadilla and othersforthcoming, Frenk and others 1989, and Omran1971. Country-specific discussions of the implicationsof epidemiological transition for health policy may befound in World Bank 1984a, World Bank 1990a, andWorld Bank 1992a. The purchasing power parity percapita incomes used in Figure 1.9 were provided byAngus Maddison. The discussion of the factors ex-plaining mortality declines is based on Ewbank andPreston 1990, McKeown 1976, and Preston andHaines 1991.The structure and content of the chapter benefitedfrom presentations made by Abdel Omran and Sam-uel Preston. Valuable comments on earlier draftswere made by Joseph Cook and Richard Morrow. Chapter 2This chapter draws on academic sources, presenta-tions by speakers in the seminar series cosponsored 177by the World Development Report and the World BankPopulation, Health and Nutrition Department, andon numerous World Bank documents. The discussionon household capacity (income and schooling) wasinformed by studies that included Anand and Ray-allion 1993, Behrman 1990, Benefo and Schultz 1992,Fuchs 1979, Grossman 1975, Hill and Palloni 1992,Jeyaratnam 1985, Lau and others, background paper,Luft 1978, Natale and others 1992, Oganov 1992, Pal-loni 1981, Pierce 1989, Pritchett and Summers, back-ground paper, Rodgers 1979, Rogot, Sorlie, and John-son 1992, Strauss and others 1992, United Nations1985, Wilkinson 1992, and World Bank 1990a.The discussion on women's schooling and childhealth drew on the extensive literature, includingBhargava and Yu 1992, Bruce and Lloyd 1992, Cald-well 1986, Cleland 1990, Elo 1992, Engle 1991, Hod-dinott and Haddad 1991, Kennedy 1992, King andHill 1993, Leslie 1989b, Lindenbaum, Chakraborty,and Elias 1985, Louat, Grosh, and van der Gaag 1992,Over and others 1992, Sahn 1990, Summers 1992,Thomas 1990, Thomas, Strauss, and Henriques 1990,and World Bank Water Demand Research Team 1993.The discussion on economic policy reform and ad-justment lending drew on sources that includedBehrman 1992, Berg and Hunter 1992, Edwards forth-coming, Kakwani, van and Pritchett andStrauss 1992, Woodward 1992, World Bank 1990b,World Bank 1992e, and World Bank 1993c.

The discussion of women andviolence benefited from assistance from JacquelynCampbell, Rosemary Garner, Lori Heise and DeanKilpatrick and drew on Archavanitkui and Pram-aualrantan 1990, Bradley 1988, CAMVAC 1985, Coun-cil on Scientific Affairs COVAC Woodruff 1991, Plitcha1992, Shim 1992, Stark 1984, and Stark and Flitcraft1991.Lawrence Lau contributed to the drafting of Box2.1. Box 2.2 is based on material provided by MichelleFryer. Carmen Barroso, Lori Heise, and Nahid Toubiacontributed to Box 2.3. John Hobcraft and AloysioAchutti assisted with the preparation of Figures 2.4 178and 2.5, respectively. Robert Anda, David Serven, John Strauss, andMolly Tees contributed helpful data and resource ma-terials. Valuable comments on earlier drafts were re-ceived chapter draws on a wide range of publishedand unpublished sources, including documentationand expertise from the World Health Organizationand the World Bank and on the academic literature.Discussion of the role of government draws on WorldBank 1991. Jamison and others forthcoming summa-rizes the methods and findings of the cost effective-ness analysis that forms the starting point for theanalyses used in this report. The data on health ex-penditures in the first section were compiled from abackground paper by Murray, Govindaraj, andChellaraj, which used a wide range of governmenthealth budgets, World Bank reports, and other coun-try studies of health financing.

Population and health data Tables A.1 and A.2 present summary data on popula-tion and GNP. Tables A.3 through A.9 provide popu-lation and health data as a supplement to the maintext and to the data presented in the World Develop-ment Indicators. All the tables except A.1 and A.2 areorganized by demographic region as presented in Ta-ble A.10. Economies are listed in ascending order ofGNP per capita as estimated for mid-1991. Regionaltotals include all the economies listed in Table A.10,but country data are presented only for those econ-omies with estimated populations of 3 million ormore in mid-1990. Taiwan (China) is not presentedseparately in this appendix but is included in the esti-mates for Other Asia and islands. Countries forwhich GNP per capita is uncertain are listed at theend of the regional groups and italicized.Although the data reported here are drawn fromthe most authoritative sources available, compara-bility is limited because of variation in data collection,statistical methods, and definitions. Differences inthe reliability of the data are indicated by presentingin italics the figures that are deemed to be lessprecise.Table A.3 Population structure and dynamicsPopulation in 1990 by country and the percentagesfor under age 15 and for age 60 and over were takenfrom Bos and others 1992. Regional totals were ob-tained by addition. The regional population totalsprovide the basis for the regional projections carriedout for this Report for the period 1950 to 2050. Thebasis for the mortality assumptions for these projec-tions varies by region. For the established marketeconomies and the formerly socialist economies ofEurope vital registration data from about 1990 wereused; future mortality trends were then adapted toagree with Bos and others 1992 for 2050. For the past,vital registration data and official life tables were usedin combination with child mortality estimates aver-aged across the countries of each region. For Chinamortality in 1990 was obtained by adjusting upwardthe deaths by age recorded in the 1990 census, usingan adjustment factor of 1.20 for males and 1.25 forfemales; these adjustment factors were derived froma comparison of the deaths by age and sex with thepopulation distribution in 1982 and 1990. For Indiathe 1988 Sample Registration System life table wastaken for 1990 without adjustment. For Latin Americaand the Caribbean 1990 mortality was based ondeaths and population by age as available in the PanAmerican Health Organization (PAHO) data base for1990. For Sub-Saharan Africa, Other Asia and is-lands, and the Middle Eastern crescent mortality esti-mates were based on country-specific estimates ofchild mortality, combined with indicators from asmall number of accurate life tables of the relation-ship between child and adult mortality. Fertility esti-mates by region for the period 1950 to 1990 were de-termined by the 1990 age distributions and themortality assumptions. Fertility estimates for the pe-riod 1990 to 2050 were taken as weighted averages ofthe country-specific values used by Bos and others1992. Estimates of migration were obtained indirectlyfrom United Nations, World Population Prospects 1990.Regional summaries for various columns of TableA.3total fertility rate, total live births, life expectancy,median age at death, child mortality rate, and adult mor-tality rate by sexare taken directly from the regionalprojections.Country-specific values for total fertility rate and to-tal live births in 1990 are taken from projection databases in Bos and others 1992. Mortality indicators arebased on the child mortality estimates for 1960, 1975,and 1990, which, for developing countries, are largelybased on the special exercise described below. 195Life expectancy at birth, e(0), is the number of yearsthat a person born in a given year could expect to live,given the age-specific mortality rates for that year. Lifeexpectancy in 1960 and 1990 and male and female adultmortality rates for 1990 were derived from the childmortality estimates for that year, combined with as-sumptions about the relationship between child andadult mortality based on the country-specific projec-tions in Bos and others 1992. The adult mortality ratefor a given sex is the probability of dying betweenages 15 and 60, expressed per 1,000. Median age atdeath is the age below which half of all deaths occur ina year.The perinatal mortality rate is the number per 1,000births of perinatal deaths (late fetal deaths, occurringat twenty-eight weeks of gestation or thereafter, andearly neonatal deaths, occurring within the firstseven days of life). Estimates of perinatal mortalitywere derived from various data sources. Vital regis-tration data were used for most of the establishedmarket economies and for Argentina, Chile, China,Singapore, and Uruguay. Vital registration data forthe republics of the former U.S.S.R. were correctedfor underreporting of perinatal deaths by using a re-gression model of perinatal mortality on postneonatalmortality based on a data series extending over aboutforty-five years (1945-91) from forty countries withcomplete vital registration. The remaining estimatesdrew on community- and hospital-based studies atthe district or other subnational level that were ex-panded to the national level using either percentageof the population living in urban areas in 1990 orpercentage of births attended by trained health staff.Vital statistics for the established market economiesand the historical data base were obtained from theU.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).The child mortality rate is defined as the probabilityof dying by exact age 5. Estimates for the period 1960to 1990 were obtained from a special exercise carriedout jointly for the World Development Report and theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the re-sults of which will be published as UNICEF, The Prog-ress of Nations 1993. (The methodology is described inHill and Yazbeck, background paper.) The sources ofinformation are those given in United Nations, ChildMortality since the 1960s (1992), augmented by re-cently available census and survey data. For each ob-servation of child mortality, there is a correspondingobservation of the date to which the measure refers:Point estimates of child mortality were obtained byfitting a line to the observations using weighted leastsquares, the independent variables being years (toaccount for trends) and the weights being based onconsensus judgment about the relative robustness ofestimates derived from different types of data. In or-der to focus on rates of change, the dependent van- 196able used is the logarithm of the observed child mor-tality rates. For estimates beyond the range of theobservations, extrapolation is used; all estimatesbased on extrapolation are shown in italics. For coun-tries not included in Child Mortality since the 1960s,estimates of child mortality by period have beentaken from United Nations, Mortality of Children underAge Five (1988). For these countries, point estimatesfor calendar years have been obtained by averagingestimates for adjacent five-year periods; thus, for ex-ample, child mortality for 1960 for Ethiopia is ob-tained as the average of the estimated values for1955-60 and 1960-65.Table A.4 Population and deaths by age groupPopulation projections for the eight demographic re-gions were made for the period 1990 to 2030, andreverse projections were made back to 1950. Thestarting point for these forward and reverse projec-tions is the age and sex distribution of each region'spopulation, as reported in Bos and others 1992. Forreverse projections, mortality assumptions are basedon child mortality estimates derived for this Report asdescribed above for child mortality rates, with addi-tional information derived from United Nations, Mor-tality of Children under Age Five (1988); migration as-sumptions were obtained indirectly from UnitedNations, World Population Prospects (1990). For the for-ward projections, assumptions on fertility, mortality,and migration were chosen to agree with Bos andothers 1992, starting from the levels used in the re-verse projection for 1985-90. The population projec-tion follows the component projection model used bythe World Bank.Table A.5 Mortality risk and life expectancy acrossthe life cycleThe figures in Table A.5 are derived from the regionalpopulation projections described in the note to TableA.4.Table A.6 Nutrition and health behaviorStunting is defined as low height-for-age; data are forchildren ages 24-59 months. Wasting is defined as lowweight-for-height; data are for children ages 12-23months. Moderate to severe stunting or wastingmeans, respectively, height-for-age or weight-for-height more than 2 standard deviations below themedian of the NCHS reference population. Whatmatters is the excess over the prevalence in the refer-ence population; the latter includes genetic effects aswell as malnutrition. Stunting is interpreted as mea-suring chronic malnutrition and wasting as measur-ing acute or short-term malnutrition, whether thecause is inadequate food intake or infectious diseaseor both. Mild or moderate malnutrition is not consid-ered disease, but all degrees of malnutrition increasethe risk of death in children. Fully breastfed babies aredefined as those given breast milk with or withoutwater, juice, or other liquids but no food or non-breast milk before age 4 months. Women are classi-fied as anemic when the blood hemoglobin level isbelow the WHO norm of 110 grams per liter.Tobacco consumption per year is an estimate of kilo-grams of consumption of dry-weight tobacco peradult (age 15 and older). Where consumption in raw-leaf equivalent is not available, data are derived byconverting data on consumption or sales of products.In some cases consumption is calculated from pro-duction of and net trade in leaf and products. Con-sumption of tobacco for 1990 and 2000 was projectedthrough a model that used assumptions on thegrowth of private consumption expenditure to deriveper capita demand for tobacco. The demand func-tions and elasticities were based on analysis of recentnational family budget surveys and past time series ofconsumption. Antismoking campaigns and otherpreventive activities that have influenced the level oftobacco consumption were considered for somecountries through a trend factor, independent of in-come and price.Sources for data on child nutrition are WorldHealth Organization (WHO), Demographic andHealth Surveys, Institute for Resource Developmentof Macro Systems (IRD), and UNICEF; for anemia,WHO; and for tobacco consumption, the Commodi-ties and Trade Division of the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (1990).Table A.7 Mortality by broad cause, and incidence oftuberculosisMortality rates are standardized for age by the directmethod, using world population as the standardpopulation. Infectious diseases and reproductive healthproblems include all deaths from infectious diseaseslisted in the International Classification of Diseases,Ninth Revision (1977), plus influenza and pneumonia,nutritional disorders and anemia, maternal causes ofdeath (including abortion), and perinatal causes ofdeath. Injuries include all violent causes, whether in-tentional, unintentional, or unknown. Noncommuni-cable diseases include all other causes of death. Deathsof which the cause was coded as ill-defined are dis-tributed among the three groups in proportion to thenumber of deaths in each group. The source is WHOdata derived from national vital statistics. Estimatesfor economies with incomplete death registration(less than 90 percent of deaths), high levels of non-medical certification of causes of death (more than 15percent), or high proportions of deaths from ill-de-fined causes (more than 20 percent) are consideredunreliable and are shown in italics.The incidence rate of tuberculosis has been esti-mated using the most recent available informationrecorded by governments and corrected for many de-veloping countries with additional information fromepidemiological studies. The data source is WHO'sTuberculosis Programme.Table A.8 Health infrastructure and servicesDoctor is defined to include only individuals with theprofessional degree of medical doctor. The definitionof nurse includes only registered nurses and regis-tered midwives. Hospital bed is defined as beds inclinics and hospitals; beds in long-term care facilitiesand nursing homes are excluded. Data sources arethe World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), PAHO, andWHO.Immunization data refer to DPT3three completeddosesofvaccineagainstdiphtheria,pertussis(whooping cough), and tetanusand measles. Thedenominator for estimating coverage is the number ofsurviving infants age 1 year. The source of data isWHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization.Table A.9 Health expenditure and total flows fromexternal assistanceHealth expenditure includes outlays for prevention,promotion, rehabilitation, and care; population activ-ities; nutrition activities; program food aid; and emer-gency aid specifically for health. It does not includewater and sanitation. Per capita expenditures and percapita aid flows are based on World Bank midyearpopulation estimates.Total health expenditure is expressed in official ex-change rate U.S. dollars. Data on public and privatehealth expenditure for the established market econ-omies and Turkey are from the OECD. For othercountries, information on government health expen-ditures is from national sources, supplemented byGovernment Finance Statistics (published by the Inter-national Monetary Fund), World Bank sector studies,and other studies. Data on parastatal expenditures(for health-related social security and social insuranceprograms) are from the Social Security Division of theInternational Labour Office (ILO) and the WorldBank. Data are drawn from Murray, Govindara;, andChellaraj, background paper.Publicsector expenditures include governmenthealth expenditures, parastatal expenditures, andforeign aid, making the figures comparable withthose for OECD countries. Private sector expendituresfor countries other than OECD members are based onhousehold surveys carried out by the ILO and othersources, supplemented by information from UnitedNations National Income Accounts, World Bank 197studies, and other studies published in the scientificliterature.Estimates for countries with incomplete data werecalculated in three steps. First, where data on eitherprivate or public expenditures were lacking, the miss-ing figures were imputed from data from countriesfor which information was available. The imputationfollowed regressions relating public or private expen-diture to GDP per capita. Second, for a country withno health expenditure data, it was assumed that theshare of GDP spent on health was the same as theaverage for the corresponding demographic region.Third, if GDP was also unknown but population wasknown, it was assumed that per capita health spend-ing was the same as the regional average.Estimates for development assistance for health are ex-pressed in official exchange rate U.S. dollars. Total aidflows represent the sum of all health assistance forhealth to each country by bilateral and multilateralagencies and by international nongovernmental or-ganizations (NGOs). Direct bilateral official develop-ment assistance (ODA) comes from the OECD coun-tries. Sources of multilateral development assistanceinclude United Nations agencies, development banks(including the World Bank), the European Commu-nity, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 198Countries (OPEC). Major international NGOs in-clude the International Committee for the Red Cross(ICRC) and the International Planned ParenthoodFederation (IPPF). National NGOs were not includedbecause the available information was not separatedby recipient country.Information on ODA from bilateral and multilateralorganizations was completed by data from theOECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC)and Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and from theAdvisory Committee for the Coordination of Infor-mation Systems (ACCIS). DAC has compiled annualaggregate ODA statistics, by sector, since 1960. TheOECD's CRS, established in 1970, complements theDAC statistics by identifying contributions allocatedby sector. The CRS data base is the most completesource of information for bilateral ODA, but its com-pleteness varies among OECD countries and fromyear to year. ACCIS has kept, since 1987, a Register ofDevelopment Activities of the United Nations thatlists sources of funds and executing agencies for allUnited Nations projects by sector.The estimates of development assistance in this ta-ble were prepared by the Harvard Center for Popula-tion and Development Studies as a background paperfor this Report.Table A.1 Population (midyear) and average annual growth Note: Because of incomplete coverage, discrepancies between summed subgroup figures may occur.Projections.

The global burden of disease, 1990 The World Bank and the World Health Organizationhave undertaken a joint exercise for this Report thatquantifies the impact in loss of healthy life from about100 diseases and injuries in 1990 (Murray and Lopez,background paper). The global burden of disease(GBD) combines the loss of life from premature deathin 1990 with the loss of healthy life from disability.The GBD is measured in units of disability-adjustedlife years (DALYs) except in Table B.8, which presentsonly deaths. Disease and injury categories are basedon the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-vision (1977). The criterion for selecting the diseasesand injuries studied was the expected magnitude ofthe burden within a specific age group. The selecteddiseases and injuries account for more than 90 per-cent of premature deaths and probably for a similarproportion of the burden attributable to disability.The tables presented in this appendix include sub-totals for different disease groups; the numbers pre-sented in the subtotals include DALYs lost as a resultof the specified diseases and, in some cases, severalresidual conditions.Calculation of the disease burden is based on sev-eral assumptions, some of which involve decisionsabout ethical values or social preferences. The keychoices are the potential years of life lost as a result ofa death at a given age; the relative value of a year ofhealthy life lived at different ages; the discount rate,or extent of time preference for human life andhealth; and the disability weights used to convert lifelived with a disability to a common measure withpremature death. The choices are described below. Afull presentation of the methodology will appear inMurray and Lopez (forthcoming).Duration of life lost due to a death at each age. Thenumber of years of life lost as a result of a death ateach age is obtained from a standard schedule of ex-pectations of life at that age. A Coale and Demeny(1983) \"West\" family model life table (level 26 withan expectation of life of 82.5 years) has been used asthe standard for females. A comparable model withan expectation of life of 80 years has been used as thestandard for males. For example, a female death atage 40 is assumed to represent a stream of lost lifethat is equal to the female expectation of life at age 40,or 43 years. Longer streams of life lost as a result of afemale death as compared with a male death at anygiven age seem to be justified by data for high-incomegroups in low-mortality populations. These datashow that women's expectations of life at birth arestill two to three years higher than males'.Value of a healthy year of life lived at each age. Mostsocieties attach more importance to a year of life livedby a young or middle-aged adult than to a year of lifelived by a child or an elderly person. The relativevalue of a year of life at each age has been modeledfor this exercise as an exponential function of theform 1w exp(-Ba), where a is age and B is equal to 0.04.This function rises quickly from zero at birth to a peakat age 25 and then declines asymptotically towardzero. The constant k is chosen so that the total num-ber of DALYs is the same as though uniform ageweights had been used (see Box figure 1.3). It is im-portant to note that while the first year of life receivesa very low weight, the life of a newborn is valuedaccording to the weights of all the years he or she isexpected to live, that is, according to the sum of thefunction over future years. In the absence of dis-counting, therefore, the greatest loss of DALYs frompremature death occurs from infant deaths. The in-troduction of discounting means that the greatest lossfrom premature death occurs in early adulthood, butthat loss is only slightly greater than the loss from aninfant death. Largely because loss of life is valuedaccording to the future stream of age-specific ageweights and not just the weight for one year, theresults of the analysis are not very sensitive to theintroduction of nonuniform age weights.Time preference. Since the stream of damage tohealth from current illness and injury can extendyears or even decades into the future, it must be de-cided how to value the future relative to the present.This is a controversial and unresolved issue becausethere are two different arguments concerning how toregard the future. First, societies typically prefer tohave a given amount of consumption today rather 213than tomorrow. This \"pure social rate of time prefer-ence\" is usually assumed to be quite low, of the orderof 0-3 percent per year, meaning that the future isvalued exactly or almost as much as the present. Sec-ond, there is a reason for discounting the futuremuch more, if resources are not consumed today butare invested so as to generate higher consumptiontomorrow. The expected rate of growth of consump-tion times the elasticity of utility with respect to con-sumption yields a term typically assumed to be about8-10 percent, comparable to the rate of return on in-vestments involving risk and taxation. In evaluatingthe global burden of disease, it is assumed that thisargument does not apply to human lives, which areincommensurable with consumption; addingtohealthy years does not necessarily raise consumptionper person. This Report therefore uses a discount rateof 3 percent per year, which could be entirely attrib-uted to pure time preference.Higher discount rates would reduce the total bur-den of disease because future health damage fromhealth losses in 1990 would count for less. More im-portant, higher discount rates would also alter therelative importance of different diseases. Because thestream of life lost as a result of mortality is, on aver-age, longer than that caused by disability, higher dis-count rates raise the importance of disability com-pared with that of premature mortality. For the samereason, higher discount rates reduce the importanceof premature deaths at young ages in relation to thoseat older ages.Disability weights. Disabilities were assigned sever-ity weights ranging from zero, representing perfecthealth, to one, representing death. These disabilityweights were determined at a meeting of experts ininternational health who had not participated in thestudy. In order to reduce the number of weights to beassigned and to emphasize large differences in theseverity of disability, each disability condition wasassigned to one of six classes of severity. The disabil-ities in a particular class differ in kind (for example,blindness versus paralysis) but were considered to beof equal severity. Each participant then voted on theweight to be assigned to the entire class, not to indi-vidualdisabilities, and the class was weightedaccording to the average vote. It is important to notethat many disabling conditions lead to two or moredistinct disabilities, which may be classified in morethan one class of severity.The burden of disease could be computed using aprevalence perspective (the extent of burden during agiven year, no matter when a disease condition be-gan) or an incidence perspective (the future burden ofthat year's new cases or incident diseases). An inci-dence perspective was chosen: the burden of diseaseis the future stream of disability caused by incidentcases in 1990. This is the more logical way of dealing214with mortality, and it is easy to apply to nonfataldisabilities. Disability-adjusted life years attributableto premature mortality are calculated on the basis of1990 deaths by cause, as presented in Table B.8.Estimates of mortality by cause were based onthree types of source: vital registration data, model-based estimates, and epidemiological estimates forparticular diseases. Vital registration data for allcountries with good registration systems that attrib-ute a cause of death were used with only minor mod-ifications; such countries include most of the estab-lished market economies, the formerly socialisteconomies of Europe, and a large proportion of thecountries of Latin America and the Caribbean. ForChina high-quality sample registration data from theDisease Surveillance Points System were used withsome modifications. Vital registration data were alsoused for some countries in the Middle Eastern cres-cent and Other Asia and islands regions.A variety of models relating cause-specific mortal-ity to total mortality by age have been developed onthe basis of the patterns of causes of death recordedin nations with good registration systems. For thelarge groups of causescommunicable plus maternaland perinatal, noncommunicable, and injuriesthesemodels have been used to allocate deaths to causegroups. Whenever possible, these estimates havebeen validated by examining the results of small-scalelongitudinal population surveillance systems. Esti-mates for more detailed causes were built up fromassessments by disease experts of incidence, remis-sion, and case-fatality rates. These epidemiologicalestimates by cause have been constructed so as to addup to total mortality.A different approach was used to estimate theDALYs lost through life lived with a disability. Agroup of experts estimated the incidence, age of on-set, and duration of disability for each specific diseaseon the basis of community-based epidemiologicaldata, routine health facilities information, and, wherenecessary, expert judgment. Separate estimates weremade for the five age groups, two sexes, and eightregions in the study. When prevalence was used toestimate incidence, the GBD incidence prevalencemodel was used to check for consistency between theestimated incidence, remission rate, case-fatality rate,and general background mortality rate. The samemodel was also used to check estimated duration foreach disability. A completed first-round set of esti-mates was reviewed at a conference hosted by theWorld Health Organization, and comments weretaken into account. A second round of estimates wasundertaken and was subjected to the same review.The third round of estimates is presented here. Afourth and final round of revisions will appear inMurray and Lopez (forthcoming).Table B.1 Burden of disease by age and sex, 1990 Note: In this appendix the demographically developing group includes the Sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Other Asia and islands, LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, and Middle Eastern crescent regions.215Demographic region and age groupMillions of disability-adjustedlife years 1990(hundredsofthousandsofDALYs lost) 216FormerlyLatinsocialistEstablishedSub-OtherAmericaMiddle of disease in males thousands of DALYs lost) Burden of disease by age and the three main groups of causes, 1990 220Demographic region and age groupCommunicable diseases andmaternal sex, and age, 1990 221(millions of DALYs lost)As result of premature death As result of disabilityDemographic region and age disease burden in children in demographically developingeconomies, showing the ten main causes, 1990Children under 5 Children ages 5-14FemaleMaleFemaleMaleTotal DALYs lost (millions) refer to health intervention priorities; disease groups are ranked only when there is a single intervention or accepted cluster ofinterventions for controlling the diseases included in the group.Can be substantially controlled with cost-effective intervention; less than $100 per DALY saved.Can be partially controlled with moderately cost-effective interventions; $250 to $999 per DALY saved.

Thisinformation is included to show the currentness ofthe sources of demographic indicators, which can be a reflection of the overall quality of a country'sindicators. Beyond these years, demographic esti- mates may be generated by projection models,extrapolation routines, or other methods. Otherdemographic indicators, such as life expectancy,birth and death rates, and under-5 mortality rates, 230are usually derived from the same sources.

Although most of the data col-lected by the World Bank are on low- and middle-income economies, comparable data for high-incomeeconomies, where readily available, are also includedin the tables. Additional information may be found inthe World Bank Atlas, World Tables, World Debt Tables,and Social Indicators of Development. These data arenow also available on diskette, in the World Bank's*STARS* retrieval system.Changes in this editionWith the independence of several new economiesduring the past year, coupled with space limitationsin the main tables, a new criteriondata availabilityhas been introduced. To be included in the main ta-bles, an economy must have reasonable coverage ofkey socio-economic indicators. Basic indicators foreconomies excluded for lack of data are presented,along with countries with fewer than 1 million popu-lation, in Table la, following Table 33.To preserve a 20-year interval between the twoyears shown for most indicators, the earliest year pre-sented has been changed from 1965 to 1970 or 1975.Readers wanting data for earlier periods can refer toprevious editions or to the publications noted above,which present data in time series.The following changes have also been made. (Theyare described more fully in the technical notes.)Estimates of fish products as a percentage of dailyprotein supply have been added to Table 4, Agricul-ture and food, because fish is an important source ofprotein for some countries and is not included in thefood production per capita estimates in the table.Table 21, Total external debt, includes two new indi-cators: total arrears on long-term debt outstandingand disbursed, and ratio of present value to nominalvalue of debt. Total arrears denotes principal and in-terest due but not paid, and the present value tonominal value of debt is a measure of the degree ofconcessionality of a country's external obligations.Table 24, Total external debt ratios, includes two newindicators: concessional debt as a percentage of totalexternal debt, and multilateral debt as a percentage oftotal external debt. These two sources of external fi-nancing are shown separately to reflect their impor-tance for many developing economies.In Table 28, Health and nutrition, the prevalence ofmalnutrition in children under 5 is used; it is consid-ered a better measure of nutritional status than thepreviously used indicator, daily calorie supply.Table 30, on income estimates, has been refined tomake use of the purchasing power of currencies(PPCs). It contains country-specific observations aswell as data derived from a regression equation.Classification of economiesThe main criterion used to classify economies andbroadly distinguish different stages of economic de-velopment is GNP per capita. This year the per capitaincome groups are low-income, $635 (22economies). Economies with populations of fewerthan 1 million and those with sparse data are notshown separately in the main tables but are includedin the aggregates. Basic indicators for these econ-omies may also be found in Table la.Further classification of economies is by geographiclocation. \"Europe and Central Asia\" now includesthe newly independent economies of the former So-viet Union. Economies formerly grouped in \"Othereconomies\" are now included in the appropriate in-come and geographic groupings. Other classificationsinclude severely indebted middle-income economiesand fuel exporters. (See Definitions and data notes,and the tables on classification of economies at theback of this book.)MethodologyThe Bank continually reviews methodology in an ef-fort to improve the international comparability andanalytical significance of the indicators. Differences 233between data in this year's and last year's editionreflect not only updates but also revisions to histori-cal series and changes in methodology.All dollar figures are U.S. dollars unless otherwisestated. The various methods used for convertingfrom national currency figures are described in thetechnical notes.Summary measuresThe summary measures in the colored bands are to-tals (indicated by t), weighted averages (w), or me-dian values (m) calculated for groups of economies.Countries for which individual estimates are notshown, because of size, nonreporting, or insufficienthistory, have been implicitly included by assumingthat they follow the trend of reporting countries dur-ing such periods. This gives a more consistent aggre-gate measure by standardizing country coverage foreach period shown. Group aggregates include coun-tries for which country-specific data do not appear inthe tables. Where missing information accounts for a 234Groups of economiesFor this map, economies are classified byincome group, as they are for the tablesthat follow. Low-income economies are thosewith a GNP per capita of $635 $636-7,910; economiesData not available (US.Kithird or more of the overall estimate, however, thegroup measure is reported as not available. Theweightings used for computing the summary mea-sures are stated in each technical note.Terminology and data coverageIn these notes the term \"country\" does not implypolitical independence but may refer to any territorywhose authorities present for it separate social or eco-nomic statistics.The unified Germany does not yet have a fullymerged statistical system. Throughout the tables,data for Germany are footnoted to explain coverage;most economic data refer to the former Federal Re-public, but demographic and social data generally re-fer to the unified Germany. The data for China do notinclude Taiwan, China, but footnotes to Tables 14, 15,16, and 18 provide estimates of the internationaltransactionsforTaiwan,China.Inalltables,Czechoslovakia refers to the former Czechoslovakiaand Yugoslavia to the man are notyet available.Table contentThe indicators in Table 1 give a summary profile ofeconomies. Data in the other tables fall into six broadareas: production, domestic absorption, fiscal andmonetary accounts, core international transactions,external finance, and human and natural resources.The table format of this edition follows that of pre-vious years. In each group, economies are listed inascending order of GNP per capita, except those forwhich no such figure can be calculated. These areitalicized and in alphabetical order at the end of thegroup deemed appropriate. This order is used in alltables except Table 19, which covers only high-in-come OPEC and OECD countries. The alphabeticallist in the key shows the reference number for eacheconomy; here, too, italics indicate economies withno current estimates of GNP per capita.

The notes outline themethods, concepts, definitions, and data sourcesused in compiling the tables. A bibliography at theend of the notes lists the data sources, which containcomprehensive definitions and descriptions of con-cepts used. Country notes to the World Tablesprovideadditional explanations of sources used, breaks incomparability, and other exceptions to standard sta-tistical practices that Bank staff have identified in na-tional accounts and international transactions.Comments and questions relating to the WorldDevelopment Indicators should be addressed toSocio-Economic Data Division, International Eco-nomics Department, The World Bank, 1818 H Street,N.W., Washington, D.C. or not availableFor this map, population density is calculated bydividing a country's population by its total surface area(square kilometers of land and inland water area).

With the additionof the recently independent republics of the formerSoviet Union, the main tables now include countrydata for 127 economies, listed in ascending GNP percapita order. A separate table, showing basic indica-tors for economies with sparse data or with popula-tions of less than 1 million, Table la covers a furtherseventy-three economies. Other changes are outlinedin the Introduction.Data reliabilityConsiderable effort has been made to standardizethe data, but full comparability cannot be ensuredand care must be taken in interpreting the indicators.Many factors affect availability and reliability; the sta-tistical systems in many developing economies arestill weak, statistical methods, coverage, practices,and definitions differ widely among countries, andcross-country and cross-time comparisons involvecomplex technical problems that cannot be unequivo-cally resolved. For these reasons, while the data aredrawn from the sources thought to be most authorita-tive they should be construed only as indicatingtrends and characterizing major differences amongeconomies rather than offering precise quantitativemeasures of those differences. In particular, data is-sues have yet to be resolved for the fifteen economiesof the former Soviet Union. Coverage is sparse, andthe data are subject to more than the normal range ofuncertainty.Most social and demographic data from nationalsources are drawn from regular administrative files,although some come from special surveys or periodiccensus inquiries. In the case of survey and censusdata, figures for intermediate years have to be inter-polated or otherwise estimated from the base refer-ence statistics. Similarly, because not all data are up-dated, some figuresespecially those relating tocurrent periodsmay be extrapolated. Several esti-mates (for example, life expectancy) are derived frommodels based on assumptions about recent trendsand prevailing conditions. Issues related to the re-liability of demographic indicators are reviewed inthe U.N. 'sWorld PopulationTrends andPolicies.Readers are urged to take these limitations into ac-count in interpreting the indicators, particularlywhen making comparisons across economies.Base yearsTo provide long-term trend analysis, facilitate inter-national comparisons and include the effects ofchanges in intersectoral relative prices, constant pricedata for most economies are partially rebased to threebase years and linked together. The year 1970 is thebase year for data from 1960 to 1975, 1980 for 1976 to1982, and 1987 for 1983 and beyond. These three pe-riods are\"chain-linked,\"to obtain 1987 pricesthroughout all three periods.Chain-linking is accomplished for each of the threesubperiods by rescaling; this moves the year in whichcurrent and constant price versions of the same timeseries have the same value, without altering the trendof either. Components of gross domestic product(GDP) are individually rescaled and summed to pro-vide GDP and its subaggregates. In this process arescaling deviation may occur between the constantprice GDP by industrial origin and the constant priceGDP by expenditure. Such rescaling deviations areabsorbed under the heading private consumption, etc.on the assumption that GDP by industrial origin is amore reliable estimate than GDP by expenditure.Because private consumption is calculated as a re-sidual, the national accounting identities are main-tained. Rebasing does involve incorporating in pri-vate consumption whatever statistical discrepancies 305arise for expenditure. The value added in the servicessector also includes a statistical discrepancy, as re-ported by the original source.Summary measuresThe summary measures are calculated by simpleaddition when a variable is expressed in reasonablycomparable units of account. Economic indicatorsthat do not seem naturally additive are usually com-bined by a price-weighting scheme. The summarymeasures forsocialindicators are weighted bypopulation.The World Development Indicators, unlike theWorld Tables, provide data for, usually, two referencepoints rather than annual time series. For summarymeasures that cover many years, the calculation isbased on the same country composition over timeand across topics. The World Development Indicatorspermit group measures to be compiled only if thecountry data available for a given year account for atleast two-thirds of the full group, as defined by the1987 benchmarks. As long as that criterion is met,noncurrent reporters (and those not providing amplehistory) are, for years with missing data, assumed tobehave like the sample of the group that does provideestimates. Readers should keep in mind that the pur-pose is to maintain an appropriate relationship acrosstopics, despite myriad problems with country data,and that nothing meaningful can be deduced aboutbehavior at the country level by working back fromgroup indicators. In addition, the weighting processmay result in discrepancies between summed sub-group figures and overall totals. This is explainedmore fully in the introduction to the World Tables.Sources and methodsData on external debt are compiled directly by theWorld Bank on the basis of reports from its develop-ing member countries through the Debtor ReportingSystem. Other data are drawn mainly from theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, the In-ternational Monetary Fund, and country reports tothe World Bank. Bank staff estimates are also used toimprove currentness or consistency. For most coun-tries, national accounts estimates are obtained frommember governments through World Bank economicmissions. In some instances these are adjusted byBank staff to provide conformity with internationaldefinitionsandconcepts,consistency,andcurrentness.Growth ratesFor ease of reference, only ratios and rates ofgrowth are usually shown; absolute values are gener-ally available from other World Bank publications,notably the 1993 edition of the World Tables. Most 306growth rates are calculated for two periods, 1970-80and 1980-91, and are computed, unless otherwisenoted, by using the least-squares regression method.Because this method takes into account all observa-tions in a period, the resulting growth rates reflectgeneral trends that are not unduly influenced by ex-ceptional values, particularly at the end points. Toexclude the effects of inflation, constant price eco-nomic indicators are used in calculating growth rates.Details of this methodology are given at the begin-ning of the technical notes. Data in italics indicatethat they are for years or periods other than thosespecifiedup to two years earlier for economic indi-cators and up to three years on either side for socialindicators, since the latter tend to be collected lessregularly and change less dramatically over short pe-riods of time.All growth rates shown are calculated from con-stant price series and, unless otherwise noted, havebeen computed using the least-squares method. Theleast-squares growth rate, r, is estimated by fitting aleast-squares linear regression trend line to the log-arithmic annual values of the variable in the relevantperiod. More specifically, the regression equationtakes the form log X = a + bt + e where this isequivalent to the logarithmic transformation of thecompound growth rate equation, X, = X,, (1 + r)t. Inthese equations, X is the variable, t is time, and a =log Xo and b = log (1 + r) are the parameters to beestimated; e is the error term. If b* is the least-squaresestimate of b, then the average annual percentagegrowth rate,r,is obtained as [antilog (b*)] andmultiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.Table 1. Basic indicatorsFor basic indicators for economies with sparse data orwith populations of less than 1 million, see Table A.1.Population numbers for mid-1991 are World Bankestimates. These are usually projections from themost recent population censuses or surveys; most arefrom 1980-91, and, for a few countries, from the1960s or 1970s. Note that refugees not permanentlysettled in the country of asylum are generally consid-ered to be part of the population of their country oforigin.The data on area are from the Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAQ). Area is the total surface area,measured in square kilometers, comprising land areaand inland waters.GNP per capita figures in U.S. dollars are calculatedaccording to the World Bank Atlas method, which isdescribed below.GNP per capita does not, by itself, constitute ormeasure welfare or success in development. It doesnot distinguish between the aims and ultimate usesof a given product, nor does it say whether it merelyoffsets some natural or other obstacle, or harms orcontributes to welfare. For example, GNP is higher incolder countries, where people spend money onheating and warm clothes, than in balmy climates,where people are comfortable wearing light clothes inthe open air.More generally, GNP does not deal adequatelywith environmental issues, particularly natural re-source use. The World Bank has joined with others tosee how national accounts might provide insightsinto these issues. The possibility of developing \"sat-ellite\" accounts is being considered; such accountscould delve into practical and conceptual difficulties,such as assigning a meaningful economic value toresources that markets do not yet perceive as\"scarce\" and allocating costs that are essentiallyglobal within a framework that is inherently national.GNP measures the total domestic and foreign valueadded claimed by residents. It comprises GDP (de-fined in the note for Table 2) plus net factor incomefrom abroad, which is the income residents receivefrom abroad for factor services (labor and capital) lesssimilar payments made to nonresidents who contrib-uted to the domestic economy.In estimating GNP per capita, the Bank recognizesthat perfect cross-country comparability of GNP percapita estimates cannot be achieved. Beyond the clas-sic, strictly intractable index number problem, twoobstacles stand in the way of adequate comparability.One concerns the GNP and population estimatesthemselves. There are differences in national ac-counting and demographic reporting systems and inthe coverage and reliability of underlying statisticalinformation among various countries. The other ob-stacle relates to the use of official exchange rates forconverting GNP data, expressed in different nationalcurrencies,to a common denominationconven-tionally the U.S. dollarto compare them acrosscountries.Recognizing that these shortcomings affect thecomparability of the GNP per capita estimates, theWorld Bank has introduced several improvements inthe estimation procedures. Through its regular re-view of member countries' national accounts, theBank systematically evaluates the GNP estimates, fo-cusing on the coverage and concepts employed and,where appropriate, making adjustments to improvecomparability. As part of the review, Bank staff esti-mates of GNP (and sometimes of population) may bedeveloped for the most recent period.The World Bank also systematically assesses theappropriateness of official exchange rates as conver-sion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used(and reported in the World Tables) when the officialexchange rate is judged to diverge by an excep-tionally large margin from the rate effectively appliedto foreign transactions. This applies to only a smallnumber of countries. For all other countries the Bankcalculates GNP per capita using the World Bank Atlasmethod.The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the aver-age of a country's exchange rate for that year and itsexchange rates for the two preceding years, after ad-justing them for differences in relative inflation be-tween the country and the United States. This three-year average smooths fluctuations in prices and ex-change rates for each country. The resulting GNP inU.S. dollars is divided by the midyear population forthe latest of the three years to derive GNP per capita.Some sixty low- and middle-income economies suf-fered declining real GNP per capita in constant pricesduring the 1980s. In addition, significant currencyand terms of trade fluctuations have affected relativeincome levels. For this reason the levels and rankingof GNP per capita estimates, calculated by the Atlasmethod, have sometimes changed in ways not neces-sarily related to the relative domestic growth perfor-mance of the economies.The following formulas describe the procedures forcomputing the conversion factor for year t:i(e2,) = - Ee_2 I -ps\\) + e1t-2and for calculating per capita GNP in U.s. dollars foryear t:(Y)(Y / N \u00b1 e7_2,,)where= current GNP (local currency) for year= GNP deflator for yeare = average annual exchange rate (local currency to theU.S. dollar) for year= midyear population for yearP = U.S. GNP deflator for yearBecause of problems associated with the availabil-ity of comparable data and the determination of con-version factors, information on GNP per capita is notshown for some economies.The use of official exchange rates to convert na-tional currency figures to U.S. dollars does not reflectthe relative domestic purchasing powers of curren-cies. The U. N. International Comparison Programme(ICP) has developed measures of real GDP on an in-ternationally comparable scale, using purchasingpower of currencies (PPCs) instead of exchange ratesas conversion factors. Table 30 shows the most recentPPC estimates. Information on the ICP has been pub-lished in four studies and in a number of other re-ports. The most recent study is Phase VI, for 1990, a 307part of which has already been published by the Or-ganization for Economic Cooperation and Develop-ment (OECD).The ICP figures reported in Table 30 are prelimi-nary and may be revised. The United Nations and itsregional economic commissions, as well as other in-ternational agencies, such as the EC, the OECD, andthe World Bank, are working to improve the meth-odology and to extend annual purchasing powercomparisons toall countries. However, exchangerates remain the only generally available means ofconverting GNP from national currencies to U.S.dollars.Average annual rate of inflation is measured by thegrowth rate of the GDP implicit deflator for each ofthe periods shown. The GDP deflator is first calcu-lated by dividing, for each year of the period, thevalue of GDP at current values by the value of GDP atconstant values, both in national currency. The least-squares method is then used to calculate the growthrate of the GDP deflator for the period. This measureof inflation, like any other, has limitations. For somepurposes, however, it is used as an indicator of infla-tion because it is the most broadly based measure,showing annual price movements for all goods andservices produced in an economy.Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of yearsa newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns ofmortality at the time of its birth were to stay the samethroughout its life. Data are World Bank estimatesbased on data from the U.N. Population Division, theU.N. Statistical Office, and national statistical offices.Adult illiteracy is defined here as the proportion ofthe population over the age of fifteen who cannot,with understanding, read and write a short, simplestatement on their everyday life. This is only one ofthree widely accepted definitions, and its applicationis subject to qualifiers in a number of countries. Thedata are from the illiteracy estimates and projectionsprepared in 1989 by UNESCO. More recent informa-tion and a modified model have been used; therefore,the data for 1990 are not strictly consistent with thosepublishedinlastyear'sWorldDevelopmentIndicators.The summary measures for GNP per capita, lifeexpectancy, and adult illiteracy in this table areweighted by population. Those for average annualrates of inflation are weighted by the 1987 share ofcountry GDP valued in current U.S. dollars.Tables 2 and 3. Growth and structure of productionMost of the definitions used are those of the U.N.System of National Accounts (SNA), Series F, No. 2,Revision 3. Estimates are obtained from nationalsources, sometimes reaching the World Bank through 308other international agencies but more often collectedduring World Bank staff missions.World Bank staff review the quality of national ac- counts data and in some instances, through missionwork or technical assistance, help adjust national se-ries. Because of the sometimes limited capabilities ofstatistical offices and basic data problems, strict inter-national comparability cannot be achieved, especiallyin economic activities that are difficult to measure,such as parallel market transactions, the informal sec-tor, or subsistence agriculture.GDP measures the total output of goods and ser-vices for final use produced by residents and nonresi-dents, regardless of the allocation to domestic andforeign claims. It is calculated without making deduc-tions for depreciation of \"manmade\" assets or deple-tion and degradation of natural resources. AlthoughSNA envisages estimates of GDP by industrial originto be at producer prices, many countries still reportsuch details at factor cost. International comparabilityof the estimates is affected by differing country prac-tices in valuation systems for reporting value addedby production sectors. As a partial solution, GDP es-timates are shown at purchaser values if the compo-nents are on this basis, and such instances are foot-noted. However, for a few countries in Tables 2 and 3,GDP at purchaser values has been replaced by GDPat factor cost.The figures for GDP are U.S. dollar values con-verted from domestic currencies using single-year of-ficial exchange rates. For a few countries where theofficial exchange rate does not reflect the rate effec-tively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions,an alternative conversion factor is used (and reportedin the World Tables). Note that this table does not usethe three-year averaging technique applied to GNPper capita in Table 1.Agriculture covers forestry, hunting, and fishing aswell as agriculture. In developing countries with highlevels of subsistence farming, much agricultural pro-duction is either not exchanged or not exchanged formoney. This increases the difficulty of measuring thecontribution of agriculture to GDP and reduces thereliability and comparability of such numbers.Industry comprises value added in mining; manu-facturing (also reported as a separate subgroup); con-struction; and electricity, water, and gas. Value addedin all other branches of economic activity, includingimputed bank service charges, import duties, andany statistical discrepancies noted by national com-pilers, are categorized as services, etc.Partially rebased, chain-linked 1987 series in do-mestic currencies, as explained at the beginning ofthe technical notes, are used to compute the growthrates in Table 2. The sectoral shares of GDP in Table 3are based on current price series.In calculating the summary measures for each indi-cator in Table 2, partially rebased constant 1987 U.s.dollar values for each economy are calculated for eachyear of the periods covered; the values are aggre-gated across countries for each year; and the least-squares procedure is used to compute the growthrates. The average sectoral percentage shares in Table3 are computed from group aggregates of sectoralGDP in current U.S. dollars.Table 4. Agriculture and foodThe basic data for value added in agriculture are fromthe World Bank's national accounts series at currentprices in national currencies. Value added in currentprices in national currencies is converted to U.S. dol-lars by applying the single-year conversion pro-cedure, as described in the technical note for Tables 2and 3.The figures for the remainder of this table are fromthe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Cerealimports are measured in grain equivalents and de-fined as comprising all cereals in the Standard Interna-tional Trade Classification (SITC), Revision 2, Groups041-046. Food aid in cereals covers wheat and flour,bulgur, rice, coarse grains, and the cereal componentof blended foods. The figures are not directly compa-rable because of reporting and timing differences. Ce-real imports are based on calendar-year data reportedby recipient countries, and food aid in cereals is basedon data for crop years reported by donors and inter-national organizations, including the InternationalWheat Council and the World Food Programme. Fur-thermore, food aid information from donors may notcorrespond to actual receipts by beneficiaries during agiven period because of delays in transportation andrecording or because aid is sometimes not reported tothe FAO or other relevant international organiza-tions. Food aid imports may also not show up incustoms records. The time reference for food aid isthe crop year, July to June.Fertilizer consumption measures the plant nutrientsused in relation to arable land. Fertilizer productscover nitrogenous, potash, and phosphate fertilizers(which include ground rock phosphate). Arable landis defined as land under temporary crops (double-croppedareasarecountedonce),temporarymeadows for mowing or for pasture, land under mar-ket or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallowor lying idle, as well as land under permanent crops.The time reference for fertilizer consumption is thecrop year, July to June.Average growth rate of food production per capita hasbeen computed from the index of food productionper capita. The index relates to the average annualgrowth rate of food produced per capita in 1979-91 inrelation to the average produced annually in 1979-81(1979-81 = 100). The estimates are derived by divid-ing the quantity of food production by the total popu-lation. For the index, food is defined as comprisingnuts, pulses, fruits, cereals, vegetables, sugar cane,sugar beet, starchy roots, edible oils, livestock, andlivestock products. Quantities of food production aremeasured net of annual feed, seeds for use in agricul-ture, and food lost in processing and distribution.Fish products are measured by the level of daily pro-tein supply derived from the consumption of fish inrelation to total daily protein supply from all food.This estimate indirectly highlights the relative impor-tance or weight of fish in total agriculture, especiallysince fishis not included in the index of foodproduction.The summary measures for fertilizer consumptionare weighted by total arable land area; the summarymeasures for food production are weighted bypopulation.Table 5. Commercial energyThe data on energy are primarily from U.N. sources.They refer to commercial forms of primary energypetroleum and natural gas liquids, natural gas, solidfuels (coal, lignite, and so on), and primary electricity(nuclear, geothermal, and hydroelectric power)allconverted into oil equivalents. Figures on liquid fuelconsumption include petroleum derivatives that havebeen consumed in nonenergy uses. For convertingprimary electricity into oil equivalents, a notionalthermal efficiency of 34 percent has been assumed.The use of firewood, dried animal excrement, andother traditional fuels, although substantial in somedeveloping countries, is not taken into account be-cause reliable and comprehensive data are notavailable.Energy imports refers to the dollar value of energyimportsSection 3 in the Standard International TradeClassification, Revision 1and are expressed as a per-centage of earnings from merchandise exports. Be-cause data on energy imports do not permit a distinc-tion between petroleum imports for fuel and thosefor use in the petrochemicals industry, these percent-ages may overestimate the dependence on importedenergy.The summary measures of energy production andconsumption are computed by aggregating the re-spective volumes for each of the years covered by theperiods and applying the least-squares growth rateprocedure. For energy consumption per capita,population weights are used to compute summarymeasures for the specified years.The summary measures of energy imports as a per-centage of merchandise exports are computed from 309group aggregates for energy imports and merchan-dise exports in current dollars.Table 6. Structure of manufacturingThe basic data for value added in manufacturing arefrom the World Bank's national accounts series at cur-rent prices in national currencies. Value added in cur-rent prices in national currencies is converted to U.S.dollars by applying the single-year conversion pro-cedure, as described in the technical note for Tables 2and 3.The data for distribution of manufacturing value addedamong industries are provided by the United NationsIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO), anddistribution calculations are from national currenciesin current prices.The classification of manufacturing industries is inaccordance with the U.N. International Standard Indus-trial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revi-sion 2. Food, beverages, and tobacco comprise ISIC Divi-sion 31; textiles and clothing, Division 32; machinery andtransport equipment, Major Groups 382-84; and chemi-cals, Major Groups 351 and 352. Other compriseswood and related products (Division 33), paper andrelated products (Division 34), petroleum and relatedproducts (Major Groups 353-56), basic metals andmineral products (Divisions 36 and 37), fabricatedmetalproducts and professionalgoods (MajorGroups 381 and 385), and other industries (MajorGroup 390). When data for textiles, machinery, orchemicals are shown as not available, they are alsoincluded in other.Summary measures given for value added in man-ufacturing are totals calculated by the aggregationmethod noted at the beginning of the technical notes.Table 7. Manufacturing earnings and outputFour indicators are showntwo relate to real earn-ings per employee, one to labor's share in total valueadded generated, and one to labor productivity in themanufacturing sector. The indicators are based ondata from the United Nations Industrial Develop-ment Organization (UNIDO), although the deflatorsare from other sources, as explained below.Earnings per employee are in constant prices and arederived by deflating nominal earnings per employeeby the country's consumer price index (CPI). The CPIis from the International Monetary Fund's Interna-tional Financial Statistics.Total earnings as a percentage of value added are de-rived by dividing total earnings of employees byvalue added in current prices to show labor's share inincome generated in the manufacturing sector. Grossoutput per employee is in constant prices and is pre-sented as an index of overall labor productivity in 310manufacturing, with 1980 as the base year. To derivethis indicator, UNIDO data on gross output per em-ployee in current prices are adjusted using the im-plicit deflators for value added in manufacturing or inindustry, taken from the World Bank's national ac-counts data files.To improve cross-country comparability, UNIDOhas, where possible, standardized the coverage of es-tablishments to those with five or more employees.The concepts and definitions are in accordancewith the International Recommendations for IndustrialStatistics, published by the United Nations. Earnings(wages and salaries) cover all remuneration to em-ployees paid by the employer during the year. Thepayments include (a) all regular and overtime cashpayments and bonuses and cost of living allowances;(b) wages and salaries paid during vacation and sickleave; (c) taxes and social insurance contributions andthe like, payable by the employees and deducted bythe employer; and (d) payments in kind.The term \"employees\" in this table combines twocategories defined by the U.N., regular employeesand persons engaged. Together these groups com-prise regular employees, working proprietors, activebusiness partners, and unpaid family workers; theyexclude homeworkers. The data refer to the averagenumber of employees working during the year.\"Value added\" is defined as the current value ofgross output less the current cost of (a) materials,fuels, and other supplies consumed; (b) contract andcommission work done by others; (c) repair andmaintenance work done by others; and (d) goodsshipped in the same condition as received.The value of gross output is estimated on the basisof either production or shipments. On the productionbasis it consists of (a) the value of all products of theestablishment; (b) the value of industrial services ren-dered to others; (c) the value of goods shipped in thesame condition as received; (d) the value of electricitysold; and (e) the net change in the value of work-in-progress between the beginning and the end of thereference period. In the case of estimates compiled ona shipment basis, the net change between the begin-ning and the end of the reference period in the valueof stocks of finished goods is also included.Tables 8 and 9. Growth of consumption andinvestment; structure of demandGDP is defined in the note for Tables 2 and 3, buthere it is in purchaser values.General government consumption includes all currentexpenditure for purchases of goods and services byall levels of government. Capital expenditure on na-tional defense and security is regarded as consump-tion expenditure.Private consumption, etc. is the market value of allgoods and services, including durable products (suchas cars, washing machines, and home computers)purchased or received as income in kind by house-holds and nonprofit institutions. It excludes pur-chases of dwellings but includes imputed rent forowner-occupied dwellings (see the technical note forTable 10 for details). In practice, it includes any statis-tical discrepancy in the use of resources. At constantprices, it also includes the rescaling deviation frompartial rebasing, which is explained at the beginningof the technical notes.Gross domestic investment consists of outlays on ad-ditions to the fixed assets of the economy plus netchanges in the level of inventories.Gross domestic savings are calculated by deductingtotal consumption from GDP.Exports of goods and nonfactor services represent thevalue of all goods and nonfactor services provided tothe rest of the world; they include merchandise,freight, insurance, travel, and other nonfactor ser-vices. The value of factor services, such as investmentincome, interest, and labor income, is excluded. Cur-rent transfers are also excluded.The resource balance is the difference between ex-ports of goods and nonfactor services and imports ofgoods and nonfactor services.Partially rebased 1987 series in constant domesticcurrency units are used to compute the indicators inTable 8. Distribution of GDP in Table 9 is calculatedfrom national accounts series in current domestic cur-rency units.The summary measures are calculated by themethod explained in the note for Tables 2 and 3.Table 10. Structure of consumptionPercentage shares of selected items in total householdconsumption expenditure are computed from detailsof GDP (expenditure at national market prices) de-fined in the U.N. System of National Accounts (SNA),mostly as collected from the International Compari-son Program (ICP) Phases IV (1980) and V (1985). Forcountries not covered by the ICP, less detailed na-tional accounts estimates are included, where avail-able, to present a general idea of the broad structureof consumption. The data cover eighty-four countries(including Bank staff estimates for China) and refer tothe most recent estimates, generally for 1980 and1985. Where they refer to other years, the figures areshown in italics. Consumption here refers to private(nongovernment) consumption as defined in theSNA and in the notes for Tables 2 and 3, 4, and 9,except that education and medical care comprise gov-ernment as well as private outlays. This ICP conceptof \"enhanced consumption\" reflects who uses ratherthan who pays for consumption goods, and it im-proves international comparability because it is lesssensitive to differing national practices regarding thefinancing of health and education services.Cereals and tubers, a major subitem of food, comprisethe main staple products: rice, flour, bread, all othercereals and cereal preparations, potatoes, yams, andother tubers. For high-income OECD members, how-ever, this subitem does not include tubers. Grossrents, fuel and power consist of actual and imputedrents and repair and maintenance charges, as well asthe subitem fuel and power (for heating, lighting, cook-ing, air conditioning, and so forth). Note that thisitem excludes energy used for transport (rarely re-ported to be more than 1 percent of total consurnp-tion in low- and middle-income economies). As men-tioned, medical care and education include governmentas well as private consumption expenditure. Transportand communication also include the purchase of auto-mobiles, which are reported as a subitem. Other con-sumption, the residual group, includes beverages andtobacco, nondurable household goods and house-hold services, recreational services, and services (in-cluding meals) supplied by hotels and restaurants;carry-out food is recorded here. It also includes theseparately reported subitem other consumer durables,comprising household appliances, furniture, floorcoverings, recreational equipment, and watches andjewelry.Estimating the structure of consumption is one ofthe weakest aspects of national accounting in low-and middle-income economies. The structure is esti-mated through household expenditure surveys andsimilar survey techniques. It therefore shares any biasinherent in the sample frame. Since, conceptually,expenditure is not identical to consumption, otherapparent discrepancies occur, and data for somecountries should be treated with caution. For exam-ple, some countries limit surveys to urban areas or,even more narrowly, to capital cities. This tends toproduce lower than average shares for food and highshares for transport and communication, gross rents,fuel and power, and other consumption. Controlledfood prices and incomplete national accounting forsubsistence activities also contribute to low foodshares. Table 11. Central government expenditure The data on central government finance in Tables11 and 12 are from the IMF's Government Finance Sta-tistics Yearbook (1992) and IMF data files. The accountsof each country are reported using the system of com-mon definitions and classifications found in the IMF'sManual on Government Finance Statistics (1986). 311For complete and authoritative explanations of con-cepts, definitions, and data sources, see these IMFsources. The commentary that follows is intendedmainly to place these data in the context of the broadrange of indicators reported in this edition.The shares of total expenditure and current revenue bycategory are calculated from series in national curren-cies. Because of differences in coverage of availabledata, the individual components of central govern-ment expenditure and current revenue shown inthese tables may not be strictly comparable across alleconomies.Moreover, inadequate statistical coverage of state,provincial, and local governments dictates the use ofcentral government data; this may seriously under-state or distort the statistical portrayal of the alloca-tion of resources for various purposes, especially incountries where lower levels of government haveconsiderable autonomy and are responsible for manyeconomic and social services. In addition, \"centralgovernment\" can mean either of two accounting con-cepts: consolidated or budgetary. For most countries,central government finance data have been consoli-dated into one overall account, but for others only thebudgetary central government accounts are available.Since all central government units are not always in-cluded in the budgetary accounts, the overall pictureof central government activities is usually incom-plete.Countriesreportingbudgetarydataarefootnoted.Consequently, the data presented, especially thosefor education and health, are not comparable acrosscountries. In many economies, private health and ed-ucation services are substantial; in others, public ser-vices represent the major component of total expen-diture but may be financed by lower levels ofgovernment. Caution should therefore be exercisedin using the data for cross-country comparisons. Cen-tral government expenditure comprises the expendi-ture by all government offices, departments, estab-lishments, and other bodies that are agencies orinstruments of the central authority of a country. Itincludes both current and capital (development)expenditure.Defense comprises all expenditure, whether by de-fense or other departments, on the maintenance ofmilitary forces, including the purchase of militarysupplies and equipment, construction, recruiting,and training. Also in this category are closely relateditems such as military aid programs. Defense doesnot include expenditure on public order and safety,which are classified separately.Education comprises expenditure on the provision,management, inspection, and support of preprimary,primary, and secondary schools; of universities and 312colleges; and of vocational, technical, and other train-ing institutions. Also included is expenditure on thegeneral administration and regulation of the educa-tion system; on research into its objectives, organiza-tion, administration, and methods; and on such sub-sidiary services as transport, school meals, andschool medical and dental services. Note that Table 10provides an alternative measure of expenditure oneducation, private as well as public, relative to house-hold consumption.Health covers public expenditure on hospitals, ma-ternity and dental centers, and clinics with a majormedical component; on national health and medicalinsurance schemes; and on family planning and pre-ventive care. Note that Table 10 also provides a mea-sure of expenditure on medical care, private as wellas public, relative to household consumption.Housing, amenities; social security and welfare coverexpenditure on housing (excluding interest subsidies,which are usually classified with other) such as in-come-related schemes; on provision and support ofhousing and slum-clearance activities; on communitydevelopment; and on sanitation services. These cate-gories also cover compensation for loss of income tothe sick and temporarily disabled; payments to theelderly, the permanently disabled, and the unem-ployed; family, maternity, and child allowances; andthe cost of welfare services, such as care of the aged,the disabled, and children. Many expenditures rele-vant to environmental defense, such as pollutionabatement, water supply, sanitary affairs, and refusecollection,are included indistinguishably in thiscategory.Economic services comprise expenditure associatedwith the regulation, support, and more efficient oper-ation of business; economic development; redress ofregional imbalances; and creation of employment op-portunities. Research, trade promotion, geologicalsurveys, and inspection and regulation of particularindustry groups are among the activities included.Other covers interest payments and items not in-cluded elsewhere; for a few economies it also in-cludes amounts that could not be allocated to othercomponents (or adjustments from accrual to cashaccounts).Total expenditure is more narrowly defined than themeasure of general government consumption givenin Table 9 because it excludes consumption expendi-ture by state and local governments. At the sametime,centralgovernment expenditure ismorebroadly defined because it includes government'sgross domestic investment and transfer payments.Overall surplus/deficit is defined as current and capi-tal revenue and official grants received, less total ex-penditure and lending minus repayments.Table 12. Central government current revenueInformation on data sources and comparability isgiven in the note for Table 11. Current revenue bysource is expressed as a percentage of total currentrevenue, which is the sum of tax revenue and nontaxrevenue and is calculated from national currencies.Tax revenue comprises compulsory, unrequited,nonrepayable receipts for public purposes. It includesinterest collected on tax arrears and penalties col-lected on nonpayment or late payment of taxes and isshown net of refunds and other corrective transac-tions. Taxes on income, profit, and capital gains are taxeslevied on the actual or presumptive net income ofindividuals, on the profits of enterprises, and on capi-tal gains, whether realized on land sales, securities,or other assets. Intragovernmental payments areeliminated in consolidation. Social security contribu-tions include employers' and employees' social secu-rity contributions as well as those of self-employedand unemployed persons. Domestic taxes on goods andservices include general sales and turnover or valueadded taxes, selective excises on goods, selectivetaxes on services, taxes on the use of goods or prop-erty, and profits of fiscal monopolies. Taxes on interna-tional trade and transactions include import duties, ex-port duties, profits of export or import monopolies,exchange profits, and exchange taxes. Other taxes in-clude employers' payroll or labor taxes, taxes onproperty, and taxes not allocable to other categories.They may include negative values that are adjust-ments, for instance, for taxes collected on behalf ofstate and local governments and not allocable to indi-vidual tax categories.Non tax revenue comprises receipts that are not acompulsory nonrepayable payment for public pur-poses, such as fines, administrative fees, or entrepre-neurial income from government ownership of prop-erty. Proceeds of grants and borrowing, funds arisingfrom the repayment of previous lending by govern-ments, incurrence of liabilities, and proceeds fromthe sale of capital assets are not included.Table 13. Money and interest ratesThe data on monetary holdings are based on theIMF's International Financial Statistics (IFS). Monetaryholdings, broadly defined, comprise the monetary andquasi-monetary liabilities of a country's financial in-stitutions to residents but not to the central govern-ment. For most countries, monetary holdings are thesum of money (IFS line 34) and quasi money (IFS line35). Money comprises the economy's means of pay-ment: currency outside banks and demand deposits.Quasi money comprises time and savings depositsand similar bank accounts that the issuer will readilyexchange for money. Where nonmonetary financialinstitutions are important issuers of quasi-monetaryliabilities, these are also included in the measure ofmonetary holdings.The growth rates for monetary holdings are calcu-lated from year-end figures, while the average of theyear-end figures for the specified year and the pre-vious year is used for the ratio of monetary holdingsto GDP.Nominal interest rates of banks, also from IFS, repre-sent the rates paid by commercial or similar banks toholders of their quasi-monetary liabilities (depositrate) and charged by the banks on loans to primecustomers (lending rate). The data are, however, oflimited international comparability, partly becausecoverage and definitions vary and partly becausecountries differ in the scope available to banks foradjusting interest rates to reflect market conditions.Because interest rates (and growth rates for mone-tary holdings) are expressed in nominal terms, muchof the variation among countries stems from differ-ences in inflation. For easy reference, the Table I indi-cator of recent inflation is repeated in this table.Table 14. Growth of merchandise tradeThe main data source for current trade values is theU.N. Commodity Trade (COMTRADE) data file sup-plemented by World Bank estimates. The statistics onmerchandise trade are based on countries' customsreturns.Merchandise exports and imports, with some excep-tions, cover international movements of goods acrosscustoms borders; trade in services is not included.Exports are valued f.o.b. (free on board) and importsc.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) unless otherwisespecified in the foregoing sources. These values are incurrent U. S. dollars.The growth rates of merchandise exports and im-ports are based on constant price data, which areobtained from export or import value data as deflatedby the corresponding price index. The World Bankuses its own price indexes, which are based on inter-national prices for primary commodities, and unitvalue indexes for manufactures. These price indexesare country-specific and disaggregated by broad com-modity groups. This ensures consistency betweendata for a group of countries and those for individualcountries. Such consistency will increase as theWorld Bank continues to improve its trade price in-dexes for an increasing number of countries. Thesegrowth rates can differ from those derived from na-tional practices because national price indexes mayuse different base years and weighting proceduresfrom those used by the World Bank. 313The terms of trade, or the net barter terms of trade,measure the relative movement of export pricesagainst that of import prices. Calculated as the ratioof a country's index of average export prices to,itsaverage import price index, this indicator showschanges over a base year in the level of export pricesas a percentage of import prices. The terms of tradeindex numbers are shown for 1985 and 1991, where1987 = 100. The price indexes are from the sourcecited above for the growth rates of exports andimports.The summary measures for the growth rates arecalculated by aggregating the 1987 constant U.S. dol-lar price series for each year and then applying theleast-squares growth rate procedure for the periodsshown.Tables 15 and 16. Structure of merchandise importsand exportsThe shares in these tables are derived from tradevalues in current dollars reported in the U.N. tradedata system and the U.N. 's Yearbook of InternationalTradeStatistics,supplemented by World Bankestimates.Merchandise exports and imports are defined in thetechnical note for Table 14.The categorization of exports and imports followsthe Standard International Trade Classification (SITC),Series M, No. 34, Revision 1. For some countries,data for certain commodity categories are unavailableand the full breakdown cannot be shown.In Table 15, food commodities are those in SITCSections 0, 1, and 4 and Division 22 (food and liveanimals, beverages and tobacco, animal and vegeta-ble oils and fats, oilseeds, oil nuts and oil kernels).Fuels are the commodities in SITC Section 3 (mineralfuels, and lubricants and related materials). Other pri-mary commodities comprise SITC Section 2 (inediblecrude materials, except fuels), less Division 22 (oil-seeds, oilnuts, and oil kernels) and Division 68 (non-ferrous metals). Machinery and transport equipment arethe commodities in SITC Section 7. Other manufac-tures, calculated residually from the total value ofmanufactured imports, represent SITC Sections 5through 9, less Section 7 and Division 68.In Table 16, fuels, minerals, and metals are the com-modities in SITC Section 3 (mineral fuels, and lubri-cants and related materials), Divisions 27 and 28(crude fertilizers and crude minerals, excluding coal;petroleum and precious stones, and metalliferousores and metal scrap), and Division 68 (nonferrousmetals). Other primary commodities comprise SITC Sec-tions 0, 1, 2, and 4 (food and live animals, beveragesand tobacco, inedible crude materials, except fuels,and animal and vegetable oils and fats), less Divisions 31427 and 28. Machinery and transport equipment are thecommodities in SITC Section 7. Other manufacturesrepresent SITC Sections 5 through 9, less Section 7and Division 68. Textiles and clothing, representingSITC Divisions 65 and 84 (textiles, yarns, fabrics,made-up articles, and related products and clothing),are a subgroup of other manufactures.The summary measures in Table 15 are weightedby total merchandise imports of individual countriesin current U.S. dollars and those in Table 16 by totalmerchandise exports of individual countries in cur-rent U.S. dollars. (See the technical note for Table 14.) Table 17. OECD imports of manufactured goods:origin and composition The data are from the United Nations, reported byhigh-income OECD economies, which are the OECDmembers excluding Greece, Portugal, and Turkey.The table reports the value of imports of man ufac-tures of high-income OECD countries by the economyof origin, and the composition of such imports bymajor manufactured product groups. These data arebased on the U.N. COMTRADE databaseRevision1, SITC for 1970, and Revision 2 SITC for 1991.The table replaces one in past editions on the originand destination of manufactured exports, which wasbased on exports reported by individual economies.Since there was a lag of several years in reporting bymany developing economies, estimates based on var-ious sources were used to fill the gaps. Until theseestimates can be improved, the current table, basedon up-to-date and consistent but less comprehensivedata, is included instead. Manufactured imports ofthe predominant markets from individual economiesare the best available proxy of the magnitude andcomposition of the manufactured exports of theseeconomies to all destinations taken together.Manufactured goods are the commodities in the Stan-dard International Trade Classification (SITC), Revision1, Sections 5 through 9 (chemical and related prod-ucts, basic manufactures, manufactured articles, ma-chinery and transport equipment, and other manu-factured articles and goods not elsewhere classified),excluding Division 68 (nonferrous metals). This defi-nition is somewhat broader than the one used to de-fine exporters of manufactures.The major manufactured product groups reportedare defined as follows: textiles and clothing (SITC Sec-tions 65 and 84), chemicals (SITC Section 5), electricalmachinery and electronics (SITC Section 72), transportequipment (SITC Section 73), and others, defined as theresidual. SITC Revision 1 data are used for the year1970, whereas the equivalent data in Revision 2 areused for the year 1991.Table 18. Balance of payments and reservesThe statistics for this table are mostly as reported bythe IMF but do include recent estimates by WorldBank staff and, in rare instances, the Bank's own cov-erage or classification adjustments to enhance inter-national comparability. Values in this table are in U.S.dollars converted at current exchange rates.The current account balance after official transfers is thedifference between (a) exports of goods and services(factor and nonfactor) as well as inflows of unre-quited transfers (private and official) and (b) importsof goods and services as well as all unrequited trans-fers to the rest of the world.The current account balance before official transfers isthe current account balance that treats net official un-requited transfers as akin to official capital move-ments. The difference between the two balance ofpayments measures is essentially foreign aid in theform of grants, technical assistance, and food aid,which, for most developing countries, tends to makecurrent account deficits smaller than the financingrequirement.Net workers' remittances cover payments and re-ceipts of income by migrants who are employed orexpect to be employed for more than a year in theirnew economy, where they are considered residents.These remittances are classified as private unrequitedtransfers and are included in the balance of paymentscurrent account balance, whereas those derived fromshorter-term stays are included in services as laborincome. The distinction accords with internationallyagreed guidelines, but many developing countriesclassify workers' remittances as a factor income re-ceipt (hence, a component of GNP). The World Bankadheres to international guidelines in defining GNPand, therefore, may differ from national practices.Gross international reserves comprise holdings ofmonetary gold, special drawing rights (SDRs), thereserve position of members in the IMF, and holdingsof foreign exchange under the control of monetaryauthorities. The data on holdings of international re-serves are from IMF data files. The gold componentof these reserves is valued throughout at year-end(December 31) London prices: that is, $37.37 anounce in 1970 and $353.60 an ounce in 1991. The re-serve levels for 1970 and 1991 refer to the end of theyear indicated and are in current U.S. dollars at pre-vailing exchange rates. Because of differences in thedefinition of international reserves, in the valuationof gold, and in reserve management practices, thelevels of reserve holdings published in nationalsources do not have strictly comparable significance.Reserve holdings at the end of 1991 are also ex-pressed in terms of the number of months of importsof goods and services they could pay for.The summary measures are computed from groupaggregates for gross international reserves and totalimports of goods and services in current dollars.Table 19. Official development assistance fromOECD and OPEC membersOfficial development assistance (ODA) consists of netdisbursements of loans and grants made on conces-sional financial terms by official agencies of the mem-bers of the Development Assistance Committee(DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD) and members of the Or-ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)to promote economic development and welfare. Al-though this definition is meant to exclude purely mili-tary assistance, the borderline is sometimes blurred;the definition used by the country of origin usuallyprevails. ODA also includes the value of technicalcooperation and assistance. All data shown are sup-plied by the OECD, and all U.S. dollar values areconverted at official exchange rates.Total net flows are net disbursements to developingcountries and multilateral institutions. The disburse-ments to multilateral institutions are now reportedfor all DAC members on the basis of the date of issueof notes; some DAC members previously reported onthe basis of the date of encashment.The nominal values shown in the summary forODA from high-income OECD countries were con-verted at 1987 prices using the dollar GDP deflator.This deflator is based on price increases in OECDcountries (excluding Greece, Portugal, and Turkey)measured in dollars. It takes into account the paritychanges between the dollar and national currencies.For example, when the dollar depreciates, pricechanges measured in national currencies have to beadjusted upward by the amount of the depreciationto obtain price changes in dollars.The table, in addition to showing totals for OPEC,shows totals for the Organization of Arab PetroleumExporting Countries (OAPEC). The donor membersof, OAPEC are Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. ODA datafor OPEC and OAPEC are also obtained from theOECD.Table 20. Official development assistance: receiptsNet disbursements of ODA from all sources consist ofloans and grants made on concessional financialterms by all bilateral official agencies and multilateralsources to promote economic development and wel-fare. They include the value of technical cooperationand assistance. The disbursements shown in this ta-ble are not strictly comparable with those shown in 315Table 19 since the receipts are from all sources; dis-bursements in Table 19 refer only to those made byhigh-income members of the OECD and members ofOPEC. Net disbursements equal gross disbursementsless payments to the originators of aid for amortiza-tion of past aid receipts. Net disbursements of ODAare shown per capita and as a percentage of GNP.The summary measures of per capita ODA arecomputed from group aggregates for population andfor ODA. Summary measures for ODA as a percent-age of GNP are computed from group totals for ODAand for GNP in current U.S. dollars.Table 21. Total external debtThe data on debt in this and successive tables arefrom the World Bank Debtor Reporting System, sup-plemented by World Bank estimates. That system isconcerned solely with developing economies anddoes not collect data on external debt for other groupsof borrowers or from economies that are not membersof the World Bank. The dollar figures on debt shownin Tables 21 through 25 are in U.S. dollars convertedat official exchange rates.The data on debt include private nonguaranteeddebt reported by twenty-seven developing countriesand complete or partial estimates for an additionaltwenty others that do not report but for which thistype of debt is known to be significant.Publicloansare external obligationsof publicdebtors, including the national government, its agen-cies, and autonomous public bodies. Publicly guaran-teed loans are external obligations of private debtorsthat are guaranteed for repayment by a public entity.These two categories are aggregated in the tables.Private nonguaranteed loans are external obligations ofprivate debtors that are not guaranteed for repay-ment by a public entity.Use of IMF credit denotes repurchase obligations tothe IMF for all uses of IMF resources, excluding thoseresulting from drawings in the reserve tranche. It isshown for the end of the year specified. It comprisespurchases outstanding under the credit tranches, in-cluding enlarged access resources, and all special fa-cilities (the buffer stock, compensatory financing, ex-tended fund, and oil facilities), Trust Fund loans, andoperations under the enhanced structural adjustmentfacilities. Use of IMF credit outstanding at year-end (astock) is converted to U.S. dollars at the dollar-SDRexchange rate in effect at year-end.Short-term debt is debt with an original maturity ofone year or less. Available data permit no distinctionsbetween public and private nonguaranteed short-term debt.Total external debt is defined here as the sum of pub-lic, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed 316long-term debt, use of IMF credit, and short-termdebt.Total arrears on LDOD denotes principal and interestdue but not paid.Present value is the discounted value of the futuredebt service payments.Table 22. Flow of public and private external capitalData on disbursements, repayment of principal (am-ortization), and payment of interest are for public,publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteedlong-term loans.Disbursements are drawings on long-term loan com-mitments during the year specified.Repayments of principal are actual amount of princi-pal (amortization) paid in foreign currency, goods, orservices in the year specified.Interest payments are actual amounts of interest paidin foreign currency, goods, or services in the yearspecified.Table 23. Aggregate net resource flows and nettransfersNet flows on long-term debt are disbursements less therepayment of principal on public, publicly guaran-teed, and private nonguaranteed long-term debt. of-ficial grants are transfers made by an official agency incash or in kind in respect of which no legal debt isincurred by the recipient. Data on official grants ex-clude grants for technical assistance.Net foreign direct investment is defined as investmentthat is made to acquire a lasting interest (usually 10percent of the voting stock) in an enterprise operatingin a country other than that of the investor (definedaccording to residency), the investor's purpose beingan effective voice in the management of the enter-prise. Aggregate net resource flows are the sum of netflows on long-term debt (excluding use of IMFcredit), plus official grants (excluding technical assis-tance) and net foreign direct investment. Aggregatenet transfers are equal to aggregate net resource flowsminus interest payments on long-term loans and re-mittance of all profits.Table 24. Total external debt ratiosTotal external debt as a percentage of exports of goods andservices represents public, publicly guaranteed, pri-vate nonguaranteed long-term debt, use of IMFcredit, and short-term debt drawn at year-end, net ofrepayments of principal and write-off s. Throughoutthis table, goods and services include workers' remit-tances. For estimating total external debt as a percentageof GNP, the debt figures are converted into U.S. do!-lars from currencies of repayment at end-of-year offi-cial exchange rates. GNP is converted from nationalcurrencies to U.S. dollars by applying the conversionprocedure described in the technical note for Tables 2and 3.Total debt service as a percentage of goods and services isthe sum of principal repayments and interest pay-ments on total external debt (as defined in the notefor Table 21). It is one of several conventional mea-sures used to assess a country's ability to servicedebt.Interest payments as a percentage of exports of goods andservices are actual payments made on total externaldebt.The summary measures are weighted by exports ofgoods and services in current dollars and by GNP incurrent dollars, respectively.Concessional debt as a percentage of total external debtconveys information about the borrower's receipt ofaid from official lenders at concessional terms as de-fined by the DAC, that is, loans with an original grantelement of 25 percent or more.Multilateral debt as a percentage of total external debtconveys information about the borrower's receipt ofaid from the World Bank, regional developmentbanks, and other multilateral and intergovernmentalagencies. Excluded are loans from funds adminis-tered by an international organization on behalf of asingle donor government.Table 25. Terms of external public borrowingCommitments refer to the public and publicly guaran-teed loans for which contracts were signed in the yearspecified. They are reported in currencies of repay-ment and converted into U.S. dollars at average an-nual official exchange rates.Figures for interest rates, maturities, and grace periodsare averages weighted by the amounts of the loans.Interest is the major charge levied on a loan and isusually computed on the amount of principal drawnand outstanding. The maturity of a loan is the inter-val between the agreement date, when a loan agree-ment is signed or bonds are issued, and the date offinal repayment of principal. The grace period is theinterval between the agreement date and the date ofthe first repayment of principal.Public loans with variable interest rates, as a percentageof public debt refer to interest rates that float withmovements in a key market rate; for example, theLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or the U.S.prime rate. This column shows the borrower's expo-sure to changes in international interest rates.The summary measures in this table are weightedby the amounts of the loans.Table 26. Population growth and projectionsPopulation growth rates are period averages calcu-lated from midyear populations.Population estimates for mid-1991 and estimates offertility and mortality are made by the World Bankfrom data provided by the U.N. Population Division,the U.N. Statistical Office, and country statistical of-fices. Estimates take into account the results of thelatest population censuses, which in some cases areneither recent nor accurate. Note that refugees notpermanently settled in the country of asylum are gen-erally considered to be part of the population of theircountry of origin.The projections of population for 2000, 2025, andthe year in which the population will eventually be-come stationary (see definition below) are made foreach economy separately. Information on total popu-lation by age and sex, fertility, mortality, and interna-tional migration is projected on the basis of gener-alized assumptions until the population becomesstationary.A stationary population is one in which age- andsex-specific mortality rates have not changed over along period, and during which fertility rates have re-mained at replacement level; that is, when the netreproduction rate (defined in the note for Table 27)equals 1. In such a population, the birth rate is con-stant and equal to the death rate, the age structure isconstant, and the growth rate is zero.Population projections are made age cohort by agecohort. Mortality, fertility, and migration are pro-jected separately, and the results are applied iter-atively to the 1990 base-year age structure. For theprojection period 1990 to 2005, the changes in mortal-ity are country specific: increments in life expectancyand decrements in infant mortality are based on pre-vious trends for each country. When female second-ary school enrollment is high, mortality is assumed todecline more quickly. Infant mortality is projectedseparately from adult mortality. Note that the datareflect the potentially significant impact of the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic.Projected fertility rates are also based on previoustrends. For countries in which fertility has started todecline (termed \"fertility transition\"), this trend isassumed to continue. It has been observed that nocountry where the population has a life expectancy ofless than 50 years has experienced a fertility decline;for these countries, fertility transition is delayed, andthe average decline of the group of countries in fertil-itytransitionisapplied. Countries with below-replacement fertility are assumed to have constanttotal fertility rates until 1995-2000 and to regain re-placement level by 2030. 317International migration rates are based on past andpresent trends in migration flows and migration p01-icy. Among the sources consulted are estimates andprojections made by national statistical offices, inter-national agencies, and research institutions. Becauseof the uncertainty of future migration trends, it isassumed in the projections that net migration rateswill reach zero by 2025.The estimates of the size of the stationary popula-tion are very long-term projections. They are in-cluded only to show the implications of recent fertil-ity and mortality trends on the basis of generalizedassumptions. A fuller description of the methods andassumptions used to calculate the estimates is con-tained in World Population Projections, 1992-93 Edition.Table 27. Demography and fertilityThe crude birth rate and crude death rate indicate re-spectively the number of live births and deaths occur-ring per thousand population in a year. They comefrom the sources mentioned in the note to Table 26.Women of childbearing age are those in the 15-49 age-group.The total fertility rate represents the number of chil-dren that would be born to a woman if she were tolive to the end of her childbearing years and bearchildren at each age in accordance with prevailingage-specific fertility rates. The rates given are fromthe sources mentioned in the note for Table 26.The net reproduction rate (NRR), which measures thenumber of daughters a newborn girl will bear duringher lifetime, assuming fixed age-specific fertility andmortality rates, reflects the extent to which a cohortof newborn girls will reproduce themselves. An NRRof 1 indicates that fertility is at replacement level: atthis rate women will bear, on average, only enoughdaughters to replace themselves in the population.As with the size of the stationary population, theassumed year of reaching replacement-level fertilityis speculative and should not be regarded as aprediction.Married women of childbearing age using contraceptionare women who are practicing, or whose husbandsare practicing, any form of contraception. Contracep-tive usage is generally measured for women age 15 to49. A few countries use measures relating to otherage groups, especially 15 to 44.Data are mainly derived from demographic andhealth surveys, contraceptive prevalence surveys,World Bank country data, and Mauldin and Segal'sarticle \"Prevalence of Contraceptive Use: Trends andIssues\" in volume 19 of Studies in Family Planning(1988). For a few countries for which no survey dataare available, and for several African countries, pro-gram statistics are used. Program statistics may un- 318derstate contraceptive prevalence because they donot measure use of methods such as rhythm, with-drawal, or abstinence, nor use of contraceptives notobtained through the official family planning pro-gram. The data refer to rates prevailing in a variety ofyears, generally not more than two years before theyear specified in the table.All summary measures are country data weightedby each country's share in the aggregate population.Table 28. Health and nutritionThe estimates of population per physician and per nurs-ing person are derived from World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) data and are supplemented by data ob-tained directly by the World Bank from nationalsources. The data refer to a variety of years, generallyno more than two years before the year specified.Nursing persons include auxiliary nurses, as well asparaprofessional personnel such as traditional birthattendants. The inclusion of auxiliary and paraprofes-sional personnel provides more realistic estimates ofavailable nursing care. Because definitions of doctorsand nursing personnel varyand because the datashown are for a variety of yearsthe data for thesetwo indicators are not strictly comparable acrosscountries.Data on births attended by health staff show the per-centage of births recorded where a recognized healthservice worker was in attendance. The data are fromWHO, supplemented by UNICEF data. They arebased on national sources, derived mostly from off i-cial community reports and hospital records; somereflect only births in hospitals and other medical in-stitutions. Sometimes smaller private and rural hos-pitals are excluded, and sometimes even relativelyprimitive local facilities are included. The coverage istherefore not always comprehensive, and the figuresshould be treated with extreme caution.Babies with low birth weight are children born weigh-ing less than 2,500 grams. Low birth weight is fre-quently associated with maternal malnutrition. Ittends to raise the risk of infant mortality and lead topoor growth in infancy and childhood, thus increas-ing the incidence of other forms of retarded develop-ment. The figures are derived from both WHO andUNICEF sources and are based on national data. Thedata are not strictly comparable across countries sincethey are compiled from a combination of surveys andadministrative records that may not have representa-tive national coverage.The infant mortality rate is the number of infantswho die before reaching one year of age, per thou-sand live births in a given year. The data are from theU.N. publication Mortality of Children under Age 5:Projections, 1950-2025 as well as from the World Bank.The years of life lost (per 1,000 population) conveys theburden of mortality in absolute terms. It is composedof the sum of the years lost to premature death per1,000 population. Years of life lost at age x are mea-sured by subtracting the remaining expected years oflife, given a life expectancy at birth fixed at 80 yearsfor men and 82.5 for women. This indicator dependson the effect of three variables: the age structure ofthe population, the overall rate of mortality, and theage structure of mortality.Child malnutrition measures the percentage of chil-dren under five with a deficiency or an excess of nu-trients that interfere with their health and genetic po-tential for growth. Methods of assessment vary, butthe most commonly used are the following: less than80 percent of the standard weight for age; less thanminus two standard deviation from the 50th percen-tile of the weight for age reference population; andthe Gomez scale of malnutrition. Note that for a fewcountries the figures are for children of three or fouryears of age and younger. The summary measures inthis table are country data weighted by each coun-try's share in the aggregate population.Table 29. EducationThe data in this table refer to a variety of years, gener-ally not more than two years distant from those spe-cified; however, figures for females sometimes referto a year earlier than that for overall totals. The dataare mostly from UNESCO.Primary school enrollment data are estimates ofchildren of all ages enrolled in primary school. Fig-ures are expressed as the ratio of pupils to the popu-lation of school-age children. Although many coun-tries consider primary school age to be 6 to 11 years,others do not. For some countries with universal pri-mary education, the gross enrollment ratios may ex-ceed 100 percent because some pupils are younger orolder than the country's standard primary schoolage.The data on secondary school enrollment are calcu-lated in the same manner, but again the definition ofsecondary school age differs among countries. It ismost commonly considered to be 12 to 17 years. Lateentry of more mature students as well as repetitionand the phenomenon of \"bunching\" in final gradescan influence these ratios.The tertiary enrollment ratio is calculated by divid-ing the number of pupils enrolled in all post-second-ary schools and universities by the population in the20-24 age group. Pupils attending vocational schools,adult education programs, two-year community col-leges, and distance education centers (primarily cor-respondence courses) are included. The distributionof pupils across these different types of institutionsvaries among countries. The youth populationthatis, 20 to 24 yearshas been adopted by UNESCO asthe denominator since it represents an average ter-tiary level cohort even though people above and be-low this age group may be registered in tertiaryinstitutions.Primary net enrollment is the percentage of school-age children who are enrolled in school. Unlike grossenrollment, the net ratios correspond to the country'sprimary-school age group. This indicator gives amuch clearer idea of how many children in the agegroup are actually enrolled in school without thenumbers being inflated by over- or under-agechildren.The primary pupil-teacher ratio is the number of pu-pils enrolled in school in a country, divided by thenumber of teachers in the education system.The summary measures in this table are countryenrollment rates weighted by each country's share inthe aggregate population.Table 30. Income distribution and PPC estimates ofGDPThe first six columns of the table report distributionof income or expenditure accruing to percentilegroups of households ranked by total household in-come, per capita income, or expenditure. The lastfour columns contain estimates of per capita GDPbased on purchasing power of currencies (PPCs)rather than exchange rates (see below for the defini-tion of PPC).The first six columns of the table give the shares ofpopulation quintiles and the top decile in total in-come or consumption expenditure for 36 low- andmiddle-income countries, and 20 high-income coun-tries. The rest of this note refers to the former set ofcountries. The data sets for these countries refer todifferent years between 1981 and 1991, and are drawnfrom nationally representative household surveys.The data sets have been compiled from two mainsources: government statistical agencies (often usingpublished reports), and the World Bank (mostly dataoriginating from the Living Standards MeasurementStudy). In cases where the original unit record datafrom the household survey were available, thesehave been used to calculate directly the income (orexpenditure) shares of different quantiles; otherwise,the latter have been estimated from the best availablegrouped data. For further details on both the dataand the estimation methodology, see Chen, Datt, andRavallion, 1993.There are several comparability problems acrosscountries in the underlying household surveys,though these problems are diminishing over time assurvey methodologies are both improving and be- 319coming more standardized, particularly under theinitiatives of the United Nations (under the House-hold Survey Capability Program) and the World Bank(under the Living Standard Measurement Study andthe Social Dimensions of Adjustment Project for Sub-Saharan Africa). The data presented here shouldnevertheless be interpreted with caution. In particu-lar, the following three sources of noncomparabilityought to be noted. First, the surveys differ in usingincome or consumption expenditure as the livingstandard indicator. For 17 of the 36 low- and middle-income countries, the data refer to consumption ex-penditure. Typically, income is more unequally dis-tributed than consumption. Second, the surveys dif-fer in using the household or the individual as theirunit of observation; in the former case, the quantilesrefer to percentage of households, rather than per-centage of persons. Third, the surveys also differaccording to whether the units of observation areranked by household income (or consumption) or byper capita income (or consumption). The footnotes tothe table identify these differences for each country.The 1987 indexed figures on PPC-based GDP percapita (US=100) are presented in the seventh col-umn. They include: (i) results of the InternationalComparison Programme (ICP) Phase VI for 1990 forOECD countries extrapolated backward to 1987; (ii)results of ICP Phase V for 1985 for non-OECD coun-tries extrapolated to 1987; (iii) the latest available re-sults from either Phase IV for 1980 or Phase III for1975 extrapolated to 1987 for countries that partici-pated in the earlier phases only; (iv) World Bank esti-mates for the economies of the Former Soviet Union(FSU) based on partial and preliminary ICP data forthe former U.S.S.R. for 1990 extrapolated to 1987; (v)a World Bank estimate for China; and (vi) ICP esti-mates obtained by regression for the remaining coun-tries that did not participate in any of the phases.Economies whose 1987 figures are extrapolated fromanother year or imputed by regression are footnotedaccordingly.The blend of extrapolated and regression-based1987 figures underlying the seventh column is extrap-olated to 1991 using Bank estimates of real per capitaGDP growth rates and expressed as an index(US = 100) in the eighth column. For countries thathave ever participated in ICP, as well as for China andthe economies of the FSU, the latest available PPC-based values are extrapolated to 1991 by Bank esti-mates of growth rates and converted to current \"in-ternational dollars\" by scaling all results up by theU.S. inflation rates; these are presented in the ninthcolumn. Footnotes indicate which year PPC-baseddata were extrapolated. Regression estimates of allcountries except FSU economies, whether or not theyparticipated in ICP, extrapolated from 1987 to 1991 320and expressed in 1991 international dollars, are pre-sented in the tenth column. The adjustments do nottake account of changes in the terms of trade. Theobserved figures should be used wherever available.Where both observed and regression numbers areavailable a comparison between the two indicates therange of errors associated with the regression esti-mates. For countries that do not have PPC-based ob-served data, there is no alternative to the use of re-gression estimates, but the extent and direction oferrors cannot be inferred in these cases.ICP recasts traditional national accounts throughspecial price collections and disaggregation of GDPby expenditure components. ICP details are preparedby national statistical offices, and the results are coor-dinated by the U.N. Statistical Division (UNSTAT)with support from other international agencies, par-ticularly the Statistical Office of the European Com-munities (Eurostat) and the Organization for Eco-nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). TheWorld Bank, the Economic Commission for Europe,and the Economic and Social Commission for Asiaand the Pacific (ESCAP) also contribute to this exer-cise. A total of sixty-four countries participated in ICPPhase V. For one country (Nepal), total GDP datawere not available, and comparisons were made forconsumption only. Luxembourg and Swaziland arethe only two economies with populations under Imillion that have participated in ICP; their 1987 re-sults, as a percentage of the U.S. results, are 83.1 and15.0, respectively. The figures given here are subjectto change and should be regarded as indicative only.The next round of ICP surveys for 1993 is expectedto cover more than eighty countries, including Chinaand several FSU economies.The \"international dollar\" (1$) has the same pur-chasing power over total GDP as the U.S. dollar in agiven year, but purchasing power over subaggregatesis determined by average international prices at thatlevel rather than by U.S. relative prices. These dollarvalues, which are different from the dollar values ofGNP or GDP shown in Tables 1 and 3 (see the techni-cal notes for these tables), are obtained by specialconversion factors designed to equalize the purchas-ing powers of currencies in the respective countries.This conversion factor, the Purchasing Power of Cur-rencies (PPC), is defined as the number of units of acountry's currency required to buy the same amountsof goods and services in the domestic market as onedollar would buy in the United States. The computa-tion involves deriving implicit quantities from na-tional accounts expenditure data and specially col-lected price data and then revaluing the implicitquantities in each country at a single set of averageprices. The average price index thus equalizes dollarprices in every country so that cross-country compar-isons of GDP based on them reflect differences inquantities of goods and services free of price-leveldifferentials. This procedure is designed to bringcross-country comparisons in line with cross-timereal value comparisons that are based on constantprice series.The ICP figures presented here are the results of atwo-step exercise. Countries within a region or groupsuch as the OECD are first compared using their owngroup average prices. Next, since group averageprices may differ from each other, making the coun-tries in different groups not comparable, the groupprices are adjusted to make them comparable at theworld level. The adjustments, done by UNSTAT andEurostat, are based on price differentials observed ina network of \"link\" countries representing eachgroup. However, the linking is done in a manner thatretains in the world comparison the relative levels ofGDP observed in the group comparisons, called\"fixity.\"The two-step process was adopted because the rel-ative GDP levels and rankings of two countries maychange when more countries are brought into thecomparison. It was felt that this should not be al-lowed to happen within geographic regions; that is,that the relationship of,say, Ghana and Senegalshould not be affected by the prices prevailing in theUnited States. Thus overall GDP per capita levels arecalculated at \"regional\" prices and then linked to-gether. The linking is done by revaluing GDPs of allthe countries at average \"world\" prices and reallocat-ing the new regional totals on the basis of each coun-try's share in the original comparison.Such a method does not permit the comparison ofmore detailed quantities (such as food consumption).Hence these subaggregates and more detailed expen-diture categories are calculated using world prices.These quantities are indeed comparable interna-tionally, but they do not add up to the indicatedGDPs because they are calculated at a different set ofprices.Some countries belong to several regional groups.A few of the groups have priority; others are equal.Thus fixity is always maintained between members ofthe European Communities, even within the OECDand world comparison. For Austria and Finland,however, the bilateral relationship that prevailswithin the OECD comparison is also the one usedwithin the global comparison. But a significantly dif-ferentrelationship (based on Central Europeanprices) prevails in the comparison within that group,and this is the relationship presented in the separatepublication of the European comparison.To derive ICP-based 1987 figures for countries thatare yet to participate in any ICP survey, an estimatingequation is first obtained by fitting the following re-gression to 1987 data:ln (r) = .5603 ln Adj.R-Sq = .95; N = 78.where all variables and estimated values are ex-pressed as US = 100;r = ICP estimates of per capita GDP converted toU.S. dollars by PPC, the array of r consisting of ex-trapolations of the most recent actual ICP valuesavailable for countries that ever participated in ICP;ATLAS = per capita GNP estimated by the Atlasmethod;ENROL = secondary school enrollment ratio; andRMSE = root mean squared error.ATLAS and ENROL are used as rough proxies ofintercountry wage differentials for unskilled andskilled human capital, respectively. Following Isen-man (see Paul Isenman, of 'Real' in World Development, 1980,vol. 8, pp.61-72), the rationale adopted here is thatICP and conventional estimates of GDP differ mainlybecause wage differences persist among nations dueto constraints on the international mobility of labor. Atechnical paper providing fuller explanation is avail-able on request (Sultan Ahmad, \"Regression Esti-mates of Per Capita GDP Based on Purchasing PowerParities,\" Working Paper Series 956, InternationalEconomics Department, World Bank, 1992. For fur-ther details on ICP procedures, readers may consultthe ICP Phase IV report, World Comparisons of Purchas-ing Power and Real Product for 1980 (New York: UnitedNations, 1986).Table 31. UrbanizationData on urban population and agglomeration in largecities are from the U.N. 's World Urbanization Prospects,supplemented by data from the World Bank. Thegrowth rates of urban population are calculated fromthe World Bank's population estimates; the estimatesof urban population shares are calculated from bothsources just cited.Because the estimates in this table are based ondifferent national definitions of what is urban, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.The summary measures for urban population as apercentage of total population are calculated fromcountry percentages weighted by each country'sshare in the aggregate population; the other sum-mary measures in this table are weighted in the samefashion, using urban population. 321Table 32. Women in developmentThis table provides some basic indicators disaggre-gated to show differences between the sexes that il-lustrate the condition of women in society. The mea-sures reflect the demographic status of women andtheir access to health and education services. Statisti-cal anomalies become even more apparent when so-cial indicators are analyzed by gender, because re-porting systems are often weak in areas relatedspecifically to women. Indicators drawn from cen-suses and surveys, such as those on population, tendto be about as reliable for women as for men; butindicators based largely on administrative records,such as maternal and infant mortality, are less reli-able. More resources are now being devoted to de-velop better information on these topics, but the re-liability of data, even in the series shown, still variessignificantly.The under-5 mortality rate shows the probability of anewborn baby dying before reaching age 5. The ratesare derived from life tables based on estimated cur-rent life expectancy at birth and on infant mortalityrates. In general, throughout the world more malesare born than females. Under good nutritional andhealth conditions and in times of peace, male chil-dren under 5 have a higher death rate than females.These columns show that female-male differences inthe risk of dying by age 5 vary substantially. In indus-trial market economies, female babies have a 23 per-cent lower risk of dying by age 5 than male babies;the risk of dying by age 5 is actually higher for fe-males than for males in some lower-income econ-omies. This suggests differential treatment of malesand females with respect to food and medical care.Such discrimination particularly affects very younggirls, who may get a smaller share of scarce food orreceive less prompt costly medical attention. This pat-tern of discrimination is not uniformly associatedwith development. There are low- and middle-in-come countries (and regions within countries) wherethe risk of dying by age 5 for females relative to malesapproximates the pattern found in industrial coun-tries. In many other countries, however, the numbersstarkly demonstrate the need to associate womenmore closely with development. The health and wel-fare indicators in both Table 28 and in this table'smaternal mortality column draw attention, in particu-lar, to the conditions associated with childbearing.This activity still carries the highest risk of death forwomen of reproductive age in developing countries.The indicators reflect, but do not measure, both theavailability of health services for women and the gen-eral welfare and nutritional status of mothers.Life expectancy at birth is defined in the note toTable 1. 322Maternal mortality refers to the number of femaledeaths that occur during childbirth per 100,000 livebirths. Because deaths during childbirth are definedmore widely in some countries to include complica-tions of pregnancy or the period after childbirth, or ofabortion, and because many pregnant women diefrom lack of suitable health care, maternal mortality isdifficult to measure consistently and reliably acrosscountries. The data in these two series are drawnfrom diverse national sources and collected by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), although manynational administrative systems are weak and do notrecord vital events in a systematic way. The data arederived mostly from official community reports andhospital records, and some reflect only deaths in hos-pitals and other medical institutions. Sometimessmaller private and rural hospitals are excluded, andsometimes even relatively primitive local facilities areincluded. The coverage is therefore not always com-prehensive, and the figures should be treated withextreme caution.Clearly, many maternal deaths go unrecorded, par-ticularly in countries with remote rural populations;this accounts for some of the very low numbersshown in the table, especially for several Africancountries. Moreover, it is not clear whether an in-crease in the number of mothers in hospital reflectsmore extensive medical care for women or more com-plications in pregnancy and childbirth because ofpoor nutrition, for instance. (Table 28 shows data onlow birth weight.)These time series attempt to bring together readilyavailable information not always presented in inter-national publications. WHO warns that there are in-evitably gaps in the series, and it has invited coun-tries to provide more comprehensive figures. Theyare reproduced here, from the 1991 WHO publicationMaternal Mortality: A Global Factbook. The data refer toany year from 1983 to 1991.The educationindicators,based on UNESCOsources, show the extent to which females have equalaccess to schooling.Percentage of cohort persisting to grade 4 is the per-centage of children starting primary school in 1970and 1986, respectively, who continued to the fourthgrade by 1973 and 1989. Figures in italics representearlier or later cohorts. The data are based on enroll-ment records. The slightly higher persistence ratiosfor females in some African countries may indicatemale participationinactivitiessuch as animalherding.All things being equal, and opportunities being thesame, the ratios for females per 100 males should beclose to 100. However, inequalities may cause the ra-tios to move in different directions. For example, thenumber of females per 100 males will rise at second-ary school level if male attendance declines more rap-idly in the final grades because of males' greater jobopportunities, conscription into the army, or migra-tion in search of work. In addition, since the numbersin these columns refer mainly to general secondaryeducation, they do not capture those (mostly males)enrolled in technical and vocational schools or in full-time apprenticeships, as in Eastern Europe.All summary measures are country data weightedby each country's share in the aggregate population.Table 33. Forests, protected areas, and waterresourcesThis table on natural resources represents a step to-ward including environmental data in the assessmentof development and the planning of economic strate-gies. It provides a partial picture of the status of for-ests, the extent of areas protected for conservation orother environmentally related purposes, and theavailability and use of fresh water. The data reportedhere are drawn from the most authoritative sourcesavailable. Perhaps even more than other data in thisReport, however, these data should be used with cau-tion. Although they accurately characterize major dif-ferences in resources and uses among countries, truecomparability is limited because of variation in datacollection, statistical methods, definitions, and gov-ernment resources.No conceptual framework has yet been agreedupon that integrates natural resource and traditionaleconomic data. Nor are the measures shown in thistable intended to be final indicators of natural re-source wealth, environmental health, or resource de-pletion. They have been chosen because they areavailable for most countries, are testable, and reflectsome general conditions of the environment.The total area of forest refers to the total naturalstands of woody vegetation in which trees predomi-nate. These estimates are derived from country statis-tics assembled by the Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion (FAO) in 1980. Some of them are based on morerecent inventories or satellite-based assessments per-formed during the 1980s. In 1993 the FAO will com-plete and publish an assessment of world forest ex-tent and health that should modify some of theseestimates substantially. The total area of closed forestrefers to those forest areas where trees cover a highproportion of the ground and there is no continuousground cover. Closed forest, for members of the Eco-nomic Commission for Europe (ECE), however, is de-fined as those forest areas where tree crowns covermore than 20 percent of the area. These naturalstands do not include tree plantations. More recentestimates of total forest cover are available for somecountries. Total forest area in the Philippines was es-timated to be between 68,000 and 71,000 square kilo-meters in 1987. The most recent estimate for Malaysiais 185,000 square kilometers.Total annual deforestation refers to both closed andopen forest. Open forest is defined as at least a 10percent tree cover with a continuous ground cover. Inthe ECE countries, open forest has 5-20 percentcrown cover or a mixture of bush and stunted trees.Deforestation is defined as the permanent conversionof forest land to other uses, including pasture, shift-ing cultivation, mechanized agriculture, or infrastruc-ture development. Deforested areas do not includeareas logged but intended for regeneration, nor areasdegraded by fuelwood gathering, acid precipitation,or forest fires. In temperate industrialized countriesthe permanent conversion of remaining forest toother uses is relatively rare. Assessments of annualdeforestation, both in open and closed forest, are dif-ficult to make and are usually undertaken as specialstudies. The estimates shown here for 1981-85 werecalculated in 1980, projecting the rate of deforestationduring the first five years of the decade. Figures fromother periods are based on more recent or better as-sessments than those used in the 1980 projections.Special note should be taken of Brazilthe countrywith the world's largest tropical closed forestwhichnow undertakes annual deforestation estimates. Theestimate of deforestation is the most recent. Brazil isunique in having several assessments of forest extentand deforestation that use common methodologybased on images from Landsat satellites. Closed for-est deforestation in the Legal Amazon of Brazil dur-ing 1990 is estimated at 13,800 square kilometers,down from the 17,900 square kilometers estimated in1989. Between 1978 and 1988, deforestation in thisregion averaged about 21,000 square kilometers peryear, having peaked in 1987 and declined greatlythereafter. By 1990, cumulative deforestation (bothrecent and historical) within the Legal Amazon to-taled 415,000 square kilometers. Deforestation out-side the Legal Amazon also occurs, but there is muchless information on its extent. A 1980 estimate, thatopen forest deforestation in Brazil totaled about10,500 square kilometers, is the most recent available.Nationally protected areas are areas of at least 1,000hectares that fall into one of five management catego-ries: scientific reserves and strict nature reserves; na-tional parks of national or international significance(not materially affected by human activity); naturalmonuments and natural landscapes with someunique aspects; managed nature reserves and wild-life sanctuaries; and protected landscapes and sea-scapes (which may include cultural landscapes). Thistable does not include sites protected under local orprovincial law or areas where consumptive uses ofwildlife are allowed. These data are subject to varia- 323tions in definition and in reporting to the organiza- tions, such as the World Conservation MonitoringCentre, that compile and disseminate these data. To- tal surface area is used to calculate the percentage of total area protected.Freshwater withdrawal data are subject to variationin collection and estimation methods but accurately show the magnitude of wateruse in both total andper capita terms. These data, however, also hidewhat can be significant variation in total renewablewater resources from one year to another. They alsofail to distinguish the variation in water availability within a country both seasonally and geographically.Because freshwater resources are based on long-termaverages, their estimation explicitly excludes decade-long cycles of wet and dry. The D\u00e9partement Hydro- g\u00e9ologie in Orleans, France, compiles water resource and withdrawal data from published documents, in-cluding national, United Nations, and professionalliterature. The Institute of Geography at the NationalAcademy of Sciences in Moscow also compiles global water data on the basis of published work and, wherenecessary, estimates water resources and consump-tion from models that use other data, such as area under irrigation, livestock populations, and precipita-tion. These and other sources have been combined by the World Resources Institute to generate (un-published) data for this table. Withdrawal data are for single years and vary from country to country be- 324tween 1970 and 1989. Data for small countries and countries in arid and semiarid zones are less reliablethan those for larger countries and those with higher rainfall.Total water resources include both internal renewableresources and, where noted, river flows from othercountries. Estimates are from 1992. Annual internalrenewable water resources refer to the average an- nual flow of rivers and of aquifers generated fromrainfall within the country. The total withdrawn andthe percentage withdrawn of the total renewable re- source are both reported in this table. Withdrawalsinclude those from nonrenewable aquifers and de-salting plants but do not include evaporative losses.Withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of renewablesupplies when extractions from nonrenewable aqui-fers or desalting plants are considerable or if there issignificant water reuse. Total per capita water with-drawal is calculated by dividing a country's totalwithdrawal by its population in the year that with-drawal estimates are available. Domestic use includesdrinking water, municipal use or supply, and uses for publicservices,commercial establishments, andhomes. Direct withdrawals for industrial use, includ-ing withdrawals for cooling thermoelectric plants, arecombined in the final column of this table with with-drawals for agriculture (irrigation and livestock pro-duction).

Definitions of groups These tables classify all World Bank member economies, plus allother economies with populations of more than 30,000.Major export category: Major exports are those that account for50 percent or more of total exports of goods and services from onecategory, in the period 1987-89. The categories are: nonfuelprimary (SITC 0,1,2, 4, plus 68), fuels (SITC 3), manufactures(SITC 5 to 9, less 68), and services (factor and nonfactor servicereceipts plus workers' remittances). If no single category accountsfor 50 percent or more of total exports, the economy is classifiedas diversified.Indebtedness: Standard World Bank definitions, of severe andmoderate indebtedness, averaged over three years (1989-91) areused to classify economies in this table. Severely indebted meanseither of the two key ratios is above critical levels: present valueof debt service to GNP (80 percent) and present value of debtservice to exports (220 percent). Moderately indebted means eitherof the two key ratios exceeds 60 percent of, but does not reach, thecritical levels. For economies that do not report detailed debtstatistics to the World Bank Debtor Reporting System,present-value calculation is not possible. Instead the followingmethodology is used to classify the non-DRS economies. Severelyindebted means three of four key ratios (averaged over 198 8-90)are above critical levels: debt to GNP (50 percent); debt to exports(275 percent), debt service to exports (30 percent); and interest toexports (20 percent). Moderately indebted means three of four keyratios exceed 60 percent of, but do not reach, the critical levels.
