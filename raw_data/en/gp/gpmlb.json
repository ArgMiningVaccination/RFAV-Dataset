The compilation which wasassembled after a review of a wide spectrum of opinions as reflectedin current literature, is divided into four main sections. The firstpresents general materials such as strategy and position paper,presidential remarks, and health care fact sheets and summaries. Thenext three sections deal with.each of three possible debatepropositions or resolutions, namely: that the Federal Governmentshould guarantee comprehensive national health insurance to all U.S.citizens; that the Federal Government should control health carecosts for all U.S. citizens; and that the Federal Government shouldguarantee catastrophic health insurance to all U.S. citizens. Thecompilation concludes with an extensive annotated bibliographypresented in four sections corresponding to the four sections of thedocument paper. A guide to other information sources on the debatetopic, as well as a list of other available government publicationson the topic, are also provided.

Instead of putting people first, the government in Washingtonhas favored the insurance companies,Arug manufacturers, and heethcare bureaucracies. We cannot build the economy of tomorrow until weguarantee every American the right to quality, affordable health care.Washington has ignored the needs of middle class familiesand let health care costs soar out of control:American drug companieshave raised their prices three times faster than the rate of inflation,forcing American consumers to pay up to six times more than Canadiansor Europeans for the same drugs. Insurance companies routinely denycoverage to consumers with \"pre- existing conditions\" and waste billionson buieaucracy and administration. Twelve years ago Americans spent$249 billion on health care. This year well spend more than 8800 billion.Health'care costs are now the number one cause ofbankruptcy and labor disputes. They threaten our ability to compete,adding $700 to the cost of every car made in America. Our complexsystem chokes consumers and providers with paper, requiring theaverage doctor to spend 80 hours a month on paperwork. It invites fraudand abuse. We spend more on health care than any nation on earth anddon't get our money's worthOur people still live in fear Today almost 60 millionAmericans have inadequate health insurance or none at all. Every yearworking men and women are forced to pay more while their employerscover less. Small businesses are caught between going broke and doingright by their employees Infants die at rates that exceed countriesblessed with far fewer resources. Across our nation older Americans livein fear that they will fall illand lose everything or bankrupt theirchildren's dreams trying to pay for the care they deserveAmerica has the potential to provide the world's best, mostadvanced and cost-effective health care. What we need are leaders whoareto take on the insurance companies, the drug companies, and Reprinted from Putting People First: a National Economic Strateu for America.Little Rock, Ark., Bill Clinton for President Committee, 1992. p. 17-19.

First, we will move to radically control costs by changingincentives, reducing paperwork and cracking down on drug andinsurance company practices. As costs drop, we will phase in guaranteeduniversal accessthrough employer or public programs to basicmedical coverage. Companies will be required to insure their employees,with federal assistance in the early years to help them meet theirobligations. Health care providers will finally have ipcentives to reducecosts and improve quality for consumers. American health care will makesense.My plan will put people first by guaranteeing quality,affordable health care. No American will go without health care, but inreturn everyone who can must share the cost of their care. The mainelements include:watIonal snendine cans. The cost of health care must notbe allowed to rise faster than the average American's income. I will scrapthe Health Care Financing Administration and replace it with a healthstandards boardmade up of consumers, providers, business, laborand governmentthat will establish annual health budget targets andoutline a core benefits packageUniversal coverare Affordable, quality health care will bea right, not a privilege.

The United States is projectedto spend 18 percent of its gross domesticproduct (GDP) on health care by the year2000 far more than any otherindustrialized country. These growing costsare being shared by individuals and thebusiness community as well as federal andstate programs. The inexorable rise in healthcare costs is constraining wage increasesand the fmancial capability of federal andstate governments to address other pressingsocial concerns. We have emphasized thatfailure to control overall health care costswill stymie efforts to control outlays onMedicare and Medicaidthe fastest growingmajor programs in the federal budgetandwill make it more difficult, i': not impossible,to bring the federal budget iato balance. 'Individuals, business, and the governmentneed to work together to tame the cost spiralfor health care.Despite having the highest costs in theindustrialized world, our health care systemis not serving large portions of our 'See particularly app. III n B et DeekitAxes on Outlook,Implicalans, and Chokes (GA 90-6A, tep 25. 1900) Page 40.41:4006-64411 Beath Cam Belem 6population very well. Nearly 34 millionAmericans are uninsured and millions moreare underinsured or fear they might losecoverage if they develop a serious medicalcondition, lose their job, or changeemployers.The Congress has asked us to reviewapproaches developed in Americancommunities and foreign countries thatmight help explain the root causes of ourhealth care problems and suggest possiblesolutions. We have examined theexperiences of Canada, France, Germany,and Japan as well as U.S. federal programsand state and community initiatives. If theUnited States is to broaden access andcontain health spending, there is a need toconsider adopting features common tosuccessful systems that we have observed inother countries and within our own borders.A reformed U.S. system must also build onthe strengths of the nation's current healthcare system. A strong researchestablishment, the continuing developmentof technology, and the capacity to evolvemore efficient service delivery mechalismsare among the strengths of the U.S. healthcare system that should be preserved. 11 Access to Health Insurance for theUninsured Universal access to health insurance is anachievable goal Countries like Canada,France, and Germany provide high-qualityhealth care to all their citizens, yet spend aconsiderably smaller share of their nations'resources on health. Within our ownborders, Hawaii is the state with the largestshare of its population covered by healthinsurance. Rochester, New York, counts7.1 percent of its population under tite age of65 as uninsured compared with a nationalaverage of about 15 percent. Yet both Hawaiiand Rochester have achieved enviablerecords in terms of health cost containmentand the level of insurance premiums.Universal access to health insurance is notfree. Estimates for providing the 34 millionpersons who are uninsured with healthinsurance range from $12 billion to$27 billion annually. These costs are not theonly factor that has made it difficult toachieve universal access to health insurancein the United States. Universal access wouldalso entail major changes in the role ofgovernment, the structure of the healthfinance system, and the financialresponsibilities of individuals andemployers. An employer mandate wouldcompel businesses to provide or financeinsurance for their employees and may add P.V gCiA0#04X411-11111, Health C.lefenn 4 new costs and responsibilities for manysmall firms. A Canadian-style system wouldinvolve a substantial increase in the share ofhealth care costs financed throuffi the taxmechanism.The United States is considering acommitment to universal coverage not onlybecause of the needs of the 34 millionuninsured but also because such coveragecan contribute to both short- and long-termstrategies for cost containment Universalcoverage contributes to loweringadministrative costs for providers byrelieving them of the burden of assessinginsurance status before treatment and bylimiting losses associated with bad debtChanges in these two areas would beespecially beneficial for institutions such asteaching hospitals and public hospitals inlarge cities that currently serve largenumbPrs of uninsured patients. Universalcoverage also contributes to systemefficiency by reducing the need for theuninsured to use more expensive treatmentsettings such as the hospital emergencyroom because they are not covered fortreatment in less expensive settings.Moreover, adequate coverage for preventiveand primary care for chronic conditions can 1 312 help avoid more costly and serioustreatments in the future.Universal health insurance coverage is notensured in all of the comprehensive reformproposals, although all proposals seek tomake significant inroads to reducing theuninsured population. National healthinsurance plans that cover all citizensexplicitly solve the problem of theuninsured. Proposals that rely on theexisting employer-based insurance modelrequire development of complementaryprograms to cover the uninsured who arenot employed and any employed persons orfamily members who remain uninsuredunder the employer-based plans.For example, Hawaii's mandate thatemployers provide insurance coverage doesnot require that health insurance coveragebe provided to part-time workers or tofamily members of insured workers. Toaddress these gaps in coverage and toinclude the unemployed who are not eligiblefor Medicaid, Hawaii developed asupplemental state-sponsored insuranceplan to extend coverage to these groups. Thestate estimates that it has reduced thenumber of uninsured to about 2 percent ofits population. 13 Private Health Insurance MarketReforms About three-fourths of uninsured Americansare workers or their dependents, and justover one-half of uninsured workers areemployed by firms with fewer than 25employees. Some underwriting and ratingpractices in the private insurance industryhave made obtaining affordable healthinsurance difficult or impossible underseveral conditions: when an insured worker,dependent family member, or coworker inthe same risk pool develops an expensivemedical condition; when a worker changesjobs; or when a firm changes insurancecarriers. If comprehensive reform is basedon the current employer-based privateinsurance system, reforms of insurancepractices that affect people in thesesituations are essential.Two broad types of health insurance reformswould be neededthose designed toimprove availability and those designed toimprove affordability. Reforms related toavailability guarantee that insurance will beavailable to all eligible members of employeegroups throughguaranteed issu f... of policies to all employergroups and their eligible members, guaranteed renewal of policies that eliminateor restrict the capacityof insurers to cancelpolicies because of medical history or tointroduce new policy exclusions at the timeof renewal, andguaranteed continuity of coverage whenemployers change insurers, employeeschange jobs, or insurers become insolvent ordiscontinue offering health insurance.Because insurance may be available but stillpriced out of the reach of small businesses,affordability also needs to be addressedthroughrestricting factors used in setting rates, suchas health status and previousclaimsexperience, andlimiting the range of premiums a singleinsurer can charge for customers withdifferent risk characteristic&These types of reforms are needed to ensurethat private insurance products are availableto everyone under employer-mandatedcoverage plan& However, such reforms canbe a double-edged sword. While they wouldincrease availability and reduce insurancepremiums for higher-risk groups that have14 been excluded from the market, the reformswould generate higher premiums for thosecurrently insured in lower-risk groups whowould share in the costs of the extendedcoverage.The net effect of insurance market reformsalone on reducing the ranks of the uninsuredis unclear. States have introduced a numberof these reforms in the last few years. Earlyexperience suggests that such reforms havehad a modest effect on reducing the ranks ofthe uninsured when coupled with limitedsubsidy programs and state assistance torisk pooling. 15 Health Care Cost Containment The call for control of health care costs isnow heard throughout U.S. society.Expanding insurance coverage to theuninsured would make cost control moreurgent, but even without that additionalspending, the upward sweep of health carecosts is threatening the financial position ofbusinesses, individuals, and governments.Cost control entails some force thatdisciplines the decisions of consumers andproviders. As a result, cost control meansthat some segments of society will receiveless. Providers (such as physicians andhospitals) will have lower revenues than ifpresent trends continue. Consumers mayface less choice among providers, and therate of improvement in medical technologymay slow.Nonetheless, cost control is imperative.Without it, the problem of the uninsured willlikely worsen as the unchecked rise in thecost of insurance puts it out of the reach ofmore and more people. Moreover, lack ofcost control will aggravate the budgetarysqueeze on the federal and stategovernments. How to control costs with thefewest adverse effects on the population isthe challenge. Page 12GA00002-284T1 Health Care Wars Amonzt the many proposals for achievingcost diwipline in U.S. health care, two broadstrategies are currently most prominentmanaged competition and direct controls.Both would use government regulation,although in quite different ways. The twostrategjes differ in the extent to which theyrely on market forces and in the extent towhich they have been tested in practice.Managed competition would give regulationa competitionenhancing slant byestablishing a complex set of rules withinwhich competition can occur. Afterrestructuring the marketplace, thegovernment would play umpire for insurers,providers, and beneficiaries while lettingcompetition exert discipline and rein inhealth care costs. The second strategy, directcontrols, would require public (orquasi-public) authorities to set health careprices, limit overall spending, and regulatethe spread of new technology.The strategy of managed competition isevolving, and its various proponentssometimes define it in different ways.Nonetheless, they agree on blending federalregulation with incentives and privateinitiative to create a cost-consciousdiscipline for hospitals and physicians. Also,current proposals assume heavy reliance on ri16 managed care health plans, such as healthmaintenance organizations (iimo) andpreferred provider organizations (ivo), thattry to encourage efficiency by placingproviders at risk for health costs, usingadministrative processes to attempt tocontrol services, or both.In designing a practical system of managedcompetition, two questions are pivotal:First, can rates for health care plans be setso that insurers are not rewarded for\"cream-skimming\"?Under current arrangements, a companyoffering health insurance makes moremoney by attracting people who arehealthier than average and by not insuringbad bealth risks. Whether a system ofmanaged competition could preventcream-skimming--which cosi savings at the expense ofquality? To prevent this, the proponents of managedcompetition stress the need to create newsources of information about the quality ofhealth care. How quickly such informadoncould be generated and how consumerswould use it are, however, open questions.Our work on twos for Medicare enrolleesshows that quality assurance is needed toavoid abuses due to cost-cutting.The strategy of managed competition isappealing to many. The Netherlands, forexample, is in the early stages ofimplementing a particular version of thestrategy. But evaluating the likelyeffectiveness of managed competition ishampered by lack of a real test, abroad orwithin an American state, in which a systemof managed competition could be observed.Some research on states with relativelystrong competition among twos and othermanaged care providers is mildlyencouraging. Nonetheless, these states havenot implemented managed competition, so itis difficult to draw conclusions from themabout how much a managed competitionsystem would flatten the trend in costs.The alternative approach, direct controls,uses fee schedules and other price controls,17 spending targets andcaps (sometimes called\"global budgets\"), andcontrols on thedispersal ALSO revealsboth wealmessesDirect controls beenemployed countrieswith many andwith a single insurer(Canada). la the UnitedStates, directcontrols are used thefederal a feeschedule a the local costs. of healthcare provide evidenceon the effectiveness, inparticular, of spendingcontrols and price controls.,Thus, we found that the cost containmentstrategy used inRochester, New Yorkwhichincluded global budgets--seemedto have slowed therise in hospital costs. ForFrance and Germany, our analysis showed that targetsand caps slowed the rate of spendingincreases compared with what would havehappened without these policies. Ouranalysis also confirmed that the strength ofenforcement is important In Germany,spending caps have replaced targets, whichwere more weakly enforced, and the capshave proved more effective in limitingspending.Direct controls on prices also have beenrelatively effective in containing costs. Asour analysis showed, U.S. states that haveset rates for hospital services to which allinsurers in the state must adhere haveslowed the growth in their per capita healthspending. In addition, Medicare, which usesa variant of price controls in reimbursinghospitals, has slowed the rise in its costs forhospital services. Other countries'experience with price controls is generallyconsistent with these findings for the UnitedStates.Direct controls are not a panacea, however.Even viewed just in terms of costcontainment, they do not eliminate allspending pressures. Moreover, directcontrols can hamper efficiency and retardinnovation. Budgeting procedures may not 418 reward efficient providers and insurers andmay not penalize inefficient ones. Spendingcaps and targets may freeze the prevailingsystem of delivering health care anddiscourage innovations like managed care.Budgets may adapt tzo slowly to changes intechnology, the demographic mix ofpatients, and methods of delivering care.Price controls can slow or block a neededshift of resources, say from one specialty toanother, when demand or supply conditionschange. To some extent these difficulties canbe mitigated, but still they must be weighedwhen the choice of a spending controlstrategy is made.In sum, neither managed competition nordirect controls is without drawbacks.Indeed, some analysts and policymakers arecrafting proposals that combine themarket-oriented advantages of mnnagedcompetition with the extra cost discipline ofdirect controlsspecifically, a cap onoverall health spending. These hybrid plansare too sketchy as yet for observers todetermine whether the two strategies can beblended, or how effective such a hybridsystem might be. 19 Administrative Simplification In the United States, nearly 6 percent of totalhealth expenditures in 1989 were accountedfor by the administration of governmenthealth programs and private insurers. Insharp contrast, Canada spends aboutone-fifth as much proportionately on theseinsurance overhead functions. In addition,U.S. providers spend billions of dollars eachyear for billing and other administrativeactivities directly attributable to our systemof financing health care. Providers inCanada, Germany, France, and Japan incurlower costs, in part because they deal with amore unified payment mechanism. Whileconsiderable debate continues about theprecise magnitude of the potential savings inadministrative overhead and providers'administrative burdens associated withspecific reform proposals, there is generalagreement that significant savings can beachieved in this area.Administrative expenses for privateinsurance plans average about 12 percent,but they can be as high as 40 percent ofclaims costs for individual and small groupplans. When multiple insurers market arange of plans differing in scope of coverage,the result is significant overhead costs tocover claims processing and marketing.While a wide range of insurers and plans Page IIIGACe0C0-14411 Heat* Care Refer* 20 may create greater consumer choice andgreater responsiveness to consumers' needs,this wide range is part of the reason forhigher administrative costs. Physicians,hospitals, and other providers must expendresources on billing and administrativeprocedures to deal with the fragmentedpayment system.Almost all reform proposals attempt toachieve cost savings by reducingadministrative costs through one or more ofthe following approaches:combining large numbers of employers intolarge insurance-buying cooperatives toachieve administrative economies,defining a single or limited number of basicinsurance plans to reduce marketing costsand the burden on providers,developing standardized claims forms andbilling procedures for all insurance plans andproviders,eliminating insurance underwriting activities,eliminating deductibles and copayments toeliminate the need for providers to issue bills, `;' 6using more inclusive methods forreimbursing providers, such as globalbudgets, andusing a single payer with uniform paymentrules and procedures in each market area.Canada, for example, achieves substantialadministrative savings through acombination of a single payer with uniformpayment rules and elimination of alldeductibles and copayments. The UnitedStates might achieve a similar level ofadministrative savings if it adopted aCanadian-type reform, but the savings couldbe largely offset by the additional use ofservices associated with the elimination ofdeductibles and copayments. Alternatively,the United States could retain deductibles,copayments, and utilization review activities.This approach would reduce potentialadministrative savings but result in greatercontrol over potential costs associated withincreased use of health services. If theUnited States should choose a system thatdepends on employer-based privateinsurance, some level of administrativesavings could still be achieved through acombination of the other approachesdescribed above. .23 Fraud and Abuse Controls The United States may want to invest more,rather than len, in the administrativeresources required for detection offraudulent and abusive practices by healthcare providers. Estimates vary widely on thelosses resulting from fraud and abuse, butthe most common is about 10 percent oftotal health care spending or about $80billion annually. Only a token amount ofadministrative resources are devoted todetection and elimination of fraudulent andabusive practices.Both public and private health insuranceprograms are subject to fraud and abuse butseparately appear unable to combat itsuccessfully. Oar work suggests that fraudand abuse may be even more prevalent inprivately insured programs, in which controlefforts have not been as prominent and datasystems are more fragmented. Indeed,federal health care programs have taken theleadership role in prevention of suchpractices. While a simpler and more uniformpayment and administrative system maymake it easier to detect potential fraud andabuse, we believe that investing the neededresouires in designing the administiativestnicture and continuing surveillance to limitthe potential for such practices is essentialThese issues are discussed more fully in ourrelated report, Medicare Claims (GA0BR-03-6, Dec. 1992). 22 Diffusion and Pricing of New MedicalTechnologies The rapid spread and increased use of newmedical technologies has been relativelyunrestrained in recent years and has givenhealth spending added momentum.Technological advances have sometimes ledhospitals to participate in a medical \"armsrace,* as they acquire expensive technologyand seek to keep patients and doctors fromshifting to rival hospitals.Once declared eligible for reimbursement,third-party bnancial advances. However, insurers'payment policies have not alwaysencouraged efficient and prudent use ofthese medical services. Instead, insurershave left themselves vulnerable to excessivespending by giving providers incentives to bewasteful or abusive in offering medicalservices. In particular, our work has shownthat in some cases, insurers have notadjusted payment rates to reflect the effectof maturing technology on costs.The challenge for policymakers is to findwaYs to encourage development of newtechnologies while ensuring their efficientuse. This can be accomplished throughpayment policies that reflect the costsincurred by high-volume, efficient providers. Page 14CACV000411411L Health Care Neter= 23Medical Malpractice Reform Savings in addition to those stemming fromcomprehensive health care reform can beachieved through fundamental changes inthe U.S. medical malpractice system. TheUnited States faces higher costs for medicalmalpractice insurance and associateddefensive medicine costs than other nations.U.S. medical malpractice premiums areestimated to be only about 1 percent of totalU.S. health care costs. There is considerablywider variation in estimates of the potentialadditional costs of defensivemedicinediagnostic tests and proceduresperformed solely to protect physicians in theevent a malpractice claim is filed. TheAmerican Medical Association estimated thecosts of defensive medicine at $20 billion in1991. Moreover, physicians want relief, notonly from the financial burdens ofmalpractice, but also from its emotionalburdens.Cost reduction should not be the sole basisfor malpractice reform. Malpractice reformalso should be directed toward providingbetter access to compensation for those whoare injured. Arbitration and no-faultprograms have been implemented in variousstates as an alternative to a complex andexpensive court process. Many of theseprograms alsu incorporate local practiceguidelines that, although not an absolutedefense, provide evidence in ajudicialprocess that accepted medical protocolswere followed. Furthermore, hospitals andother medical settings are adoptingrisk-management programs that areexpected to improve the quality of care. Webelieve these efforts should continue to bestudied and, when positive effects aredemonstrated, should be considered inconjunction with comprehensive health carereform. 24 Observations About Health CareReform 3 t)Reform of U.S. financing of health insuranceand payment of health care providers is adaunting task U.S. health care is an $800billion enterprise that is diverse,complicated, and dynamic. Achieving reformwill be particularly difficult because, tomany people, reform seems to threaten agood situation. People whose healthinsurance is adequate and whose health careis good may fear that reform will result indiminished care or higher costs for them.For providers as well as consumers, reformof the health care marketplace will cause aconsiderable reshuffling and generate losersas well as winners.Moreover, reform will not produce astructure that is perfect. Our reviews of thehealth systems of other countries shows thatafter putting major reforms in place, thesecountries cc tainue to seek ways to improvetheir systems. We believe that theimperfections of any reformand thedynamic character of the health careindustrymake a stream of further changesinevitable in the years ahead. However, theremay be greater risks in not undertaldngcomprehensive health care reform. Withoutreform, costs will continue to escalate whilea substantial number of Americans lackaccess to health insurance.

CHAPTER 4The Economics Of Health CareAMERICANS ARE LIVING LONGER, healthier lives than ever before. Since 1960, average life expectancy has increased by more than 5 years. American physicians have access to the best technolo- gy in the world and more than one-half of the world's medical re-search is funded by private and public sources in the United States.At the same time, the share of the Nation's income devoted to health care has been growing rapidly, and today more than 35 mil- lion Americans lack health insurance. Growing concern about rising expenditures and reduced access to insurance has led to thedevelopment of a wide variety of proposals for health care reform, from the Administration's market-based approach to calls for a government-run national health insurance program.The success of any of these proposals will depend on how well it addresses the reasons behind the increase in expenditures and de- cline in insurance. Economics is very helpful in understanding these developments. It suggests that most health care in the United States is financed and delivered in ways that give both health care providers and their insured patients many incentives to increase the quality of health care but little reason to be con- cerned about its cost.HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATESIn many respects, the health care industry resembles other serv- ice industries such as transportation and legal services. It supplies a servicehealth carein response to consumer demand. But thedemand for health care is different from the demand for many other services because most people do not pay for their care direct- ly. Instead, the government and private insurers pay most health care expenses. The supply of health care also differs from that ofmany other service industries. Consumers rely on providers for in-formation about health care services and these providers are heavi- ly regulated, primarily by other health care providers. Finally, many people believe that health care is inherently different fromother goods and services. They believe that everyone should be en- titled to at least some health Tare, although they may not believe that everyone has a similar entitlement to goods in general. 64-300 0 - 93- 2119 28 THE HEALTH OF THE U.S. POPULATIONAmericans buy health care to improve their health, but recentresearch suggests that the connection between health care andhealth is not a simple one. In fact, increases in life expectancy indeveloped countries are not strongly related to increases in thenumber of physicians or hospital beds per capita, nor are they pri-marily a consequence of increasing utilization of these services.Studies show that :ncreases in life erpectancy are mainly related tochanges in behavior and improvements in medical technology. Be-tween 1960 and 1990, life expectancy at birth, which is strongly af-fected by changes in infant mortality, rose from 67 years to 72years for men and from 73 years to 79 years for women. The lifeexpectancy of older Americans, a group that may be more stronglyaffected by improvements in medical technology, increased by 3years between 1960 and 1990, a larger increase than occurred be-tween 1900 and 1960.Changes in BehaviorChanges in behavior offer great promise as a way to prevent dis-ease and preventing disease is often less costly than treating it.Many Americans have adopted increasingly healthy lifestyles.During the 1980s, the rate of smoking among adults decreased from33 to 26 percent, more Americans exercised regularly, and deathsassociated with alcohol abuse declined substantially. Traffic acci-dent deaths per capita have declined by over 30 percent since 1970,in part because of greater use of seat belts.Medical TechnologyImprovements in medical technology (a term that includes drugs,vaccines, and knowledge about treatments as well as medicalequipment) reduce the incidence of disease and improve the effec-tiveness of treatment. For example, over 33,000 cases of polio werereported in the United States in 1950, but polio has been all buteradicated since the development of the polio vaccine. Only 25years ago, childhood leukemia was nearly always fatal; today thelong-term survival rate for children diagnosed with leukemia isabout 65 percent. New drugs have greatly improved the well-beingof those with ulcers and virtually eliminated the need for surgeryto treat this medical problem. Similarly, coronary bypass surgeryhas greatly improved the quality of life of those with angina.Continuing ProblemsDespite the many medical advances of recent years, cures formany diseases have yet to be discovered and new diseases continueto emerge. For example, the rate of mortality from breast cancerhas not improved since 1950 despite the development of newscreening methods and new treatment therapies. Acquired immune 120 29 deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, has claimed the lives of over 160,000Americans. Tuberculosis, a disease that had almost disappeared inthe United States, has reemerged. Among young people, homicideand drug abuse exact an enormous toll.A further problem is the persistence of serious disparities inhealth across income and race categories. For example, blackbabies are more than twice as likely as white babies to have lowbirthweight. While many ascribe these differences in health to dif-ferences in the ability to pay for care, evidence from the UnitedStates and other countries casts doubt on the belief that health in-surance alone can greatly narrow these disparities. Studies in theUnited Kingdom have found that the gap in mortality between richand poor has actually increased since the introduction of nationalhealth insurance. This result is consistent with evidence showingthat increased utilization of medical services has relatively littleeffect on health.PROVIDING AND PAYING FOR HEALTH CARESERVICES IN THE UNITED STATESThe U.S. health care industry as defined in government statisticsincludes services provided in hospitals, nursing homes, laboratories,and physicians' and dentists' offices. It also includes prescriptionand nonprescription drugs, artificial limbs, and eyeglasses, as wellas the services of nontraditional practitioners. But many goods andservices that may strongly affect health, such as fitness club serv-ices and food, are not included in the usual definition.The U.S. health care industry employs 9 million people, includ-ing over 600,000 physicians; by comparison, the automobile manu-facturing industry employs about 800,000 people. Inpatient servicesare provided by approximately 6,500 hospitals containing over 1million hospital beds. One-half of these hospitals are private, non-profit institutions, some 30 percent are operated by Federal, State,and municipal governments, and the remainder are operated pri-vately on a for-profit basis.Health care expenditures averaged $2,566 per person in 1990 andwere divided among health care services in almost the same pro-portion as in 1960. The largest part of each health care dollar,about 38 cents in 1990, was spent on hospital care, which covers allservices billed through a hospital, including those of some physi-cians. such as medical residents and radiologists. More than 1 inevery 10 Americans was admitted to a non-Federal short-stay hos-pital (a hospital in which the average length of stay is less than 30days) in 1990, for an average stay of 6 days; over 10 percent ofthese admissions were for maternity care. Physician services arethe second largest category of expenditures, accounting for about19 percent of health care expenditures. In 1990, the average 121 3 30 American made 5.5 visits to a doctor. Most of the remaining 43 per-cent of health care expenditures was divided among drugs, nursinghome care, dental services, vision products, and home health careservices.In most other developed countries, the government plays a largerpart in fmancing and, in many cases, in delivering health carethan in the United States.

In 1960, most medical care was paid for directlyby consumers, but by 1990 only 23 percent of health care expenseswere paid for directly by consumers. Thirty-two percent were cov-ered by private health insurers and 41 percent by the government.This change can be traced to three developments: the expansion ofemployer-provided benefits, the development of medicare (a govern-ment program that finances care for the elderly and disabled), andthe initiation of medicaid, a program that extended and formalized 122 3 6BEST COPY AVAIII:BLE 31 Box 4-2.-Ge11111111,-.-All working Ger:Pans and their familieS are required to havehealth insurance.

Most blue-collar workers are assignid to a sPecific plan, while mostwhite-collar workers may choose among plans. In addition,about 26 percent of the population earn incomes high enoughto allow them to opt out of the sickness funds and purchaseprivate insurance; over one-third of those eligible do so. Out-of-pocket payments in the sickness funds are very low. The sick-ness funds are financed primarily from payroll taxes, and pre-mium rates can vary substantially according to the fund. Gen-eral revenues are used to fund coverage for the nonworkingpoor, who are insured through the sickness funds.German physicians belong to regional associations that nego-tiate lumpsum budgets with the sicknees funds. Individualphysicians are then reimbursed by the physicians' associationson a fee-for-service basis, with the fees adjusted retroactively tocomply with the negotiated budget. Hospitals are paid operat-ing costs negotiated between the hoepitals and sickness fundsand pay the salaries of their staff physicians out of these oper-ating costa. Hospital capital investments are mainly paid forby State governments.Germans make many more physician visits per year thanAmericans, but the average visit is much briefer. Germans alsospend more days in the hospital, on average, than do Ameri-cans.

By1960, private employers were paying for about 13 percent of nation-al health care expenditures, and tday, most Americans receivehealth insurance benefits through their employers (Chart 4-2).Tax Treatment of BenefitsTax provisions that exempt employer-provided health insurancefrom Federal and State income taxes encourage the spread of suchinsurance. Employees do not pay tax on the share of their compen-sation that comes to them in the form of employer-paid health in-surance. This preferential tax treatment is effectively a govern-ment subsidy. The amount of the subsidy depends on the worker'stax rate: the higher the tax rate, the greater the subsidy. Thegreater the subsidy, the more likely workers are to want a largerpart of their compensation in the form of health insurance.Firms can increase the generosity of a health insurance packageby lowering deductibles (the fixed amounts that policyholders mustpay toward bills each year before any insurance payments aremade), copayment rates (the share of medical bills that must bepaid by policyholders), or the employee's share of premiums. Em-ployers may also expand the range of services included in policies,as they did during the 1980s, when an increasing proportion beganto offer vision and home health care benefits.

In 1965,when the marginal combined Federal tax rate of the medianworker (including the Federal income tax and the employee's andemployer's shares of the Social Security and medicare tax),was 17percent, private employer contributions for private health insur-ance accounted for 14 percent of U.S. national health care expendi-tures. By 1982, when the combined marginal rate reached 38 per-cent, 21 percent of U.S. health expenditures were accounted for byprivate employer contributions for private insurance. During the1980s, the marginal combined tax rate of the median worker fell(to 30 percent in 1990) and the share of national health care ex-penditures paid for by private employer contributions stoppedrising, remaining at about its 1982 level, although the dollar amount of employer health care expenditures continued to in-crease. 125 34 Chart 4-2Health Insurance CoverageMost Americans receive health insurance through their employers. 7%Percent of populationby insurance providerhole Other ociudes tor example. pr.vately purchased health \"'wante and the Department of VeteransAttarrsSources Department of Commerce and Congressonal Research SennceEmployer-sponsored insurance is also exempt from State incometaxes in most States, but these taxes are not included in the abovefigures. State income taxes currently range between 0 and 12 per-cent, so that for most people the entire tax subsidy is greater thanthe Federal subsidy.By not taxing benefits as income, the government is effectivelyforgoing revenues that could be used to lower tax rates. If all thehealth insurance benefits expected to be provided in 1993 werecounted as part of Americans' taxable income. the Federal Gove-n-ment would collect approximately $65 billion in additional reve-nues.Insurance Costs and Money WagesA firm's cost of health insurance must be passed along to some-onecustomers, owners, employees, suppliers, or some combinationof these groups. In most cases, employers are constrained in theirability to pass along these costs to their customers, owners, and sup-pliers. In general, when health insurance costs rise, firms must raisethe cash component of wages luss than they otherwise would inorder to meet the higher health irsurance costs. 126 35 Between 1t73 and 1989, employers' contributions to health insur-ance absorbed more than one-half of workers' real gains in compen-sation. Much of the growth in compensation reported for the 198estook the form of higher health insurance premiums.THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLEUntil the mid-1960s, the government's role in the provision andfinancing of health care was limited primarily to prevention andmedical research. Some government health care spending contin-ues to be targeted to these areas. The Federal Government spentover $22 billion in 1992 on preventive health efforts, including$594 million spent for AIDS prevention and $297 million for child-hood immunizations. In 1990 the Federal Government spent about$10 billion to fund medical research. Since the mid-1960s, the gov- ernment has also taken an active role in providing health insur-ance.MedicareMedicare, a nationwide Federal health insurance program that began in 1966 for people over 65 and for those with disabilities, iscomprised of a hospital insurance program and a supplementary medical insurance program. Most Americans over the age of 65 are eligible for medicare hospital insurance benefits, which they re- ceive without paying a special premium. Some disabled persons under 65 and most people who suffer from chronic kidney diseaseare eligible for medicare hospital benefits.Medicare hospital benefits cover all reasonable costs for 60 daysof inpatient hospital care per year, after a $676 deductible; days 61 through 90 are covered with a daily copayment of $169. In addition, those insured through medicare have a 60-day lifetime reserve for hospitalizations exceeding 90 days, during which they must contrib- ute $338 a day toward the cost of their care. (These deductible and patient payment amounts are for calendar year 1993.) Medicare hospital insurance also provides limited coverage for posthospital nursing services, home health care, and hospice care for the termi- nally ill.Participation in the medical insurance portion of medicare is vol- untary. For a monthly premium of $36.60, people 65 and over and all others eligible for hospital benefits may purchase medical insur- ance. When the medicare program began, premium income fi-nanced half the cost of supplementary medical insurance but today premiums cover only about one-quarter of the costs of these bene- fits and general tax revenues cover the remainder. Medicare medi- cal insurance covers physician services, laboratory and other diag- nostic tests, and outpatient hospital services. It generally pays 80 percent of the approved amount for each service with an annual deductible of $100. 127 36 Many medicare beneficiaries purchase additional private insur-ance, called medigap insurance, to cover deductibles and copay-ments that are not paid by medicare. In 1990, 77 percent of medi-care beneficiaries had medigap insurance. Of these, some 44 per-cent purchased such insurance directly; another 40 percent wereretirees receiving medigap coverage through their former employ-ers. For medicare recipients below the poverty level, another gov-ernment program, medicaid (discussed below), provides this addi-tional coverage. A recent change in Federal law requires that allmedigap insurance must cover all patient payments for hospitaland medical care except the deductibles. Purchasers of medigap in-surance have relatively few out-of-pocket expenses for hospital andphysician bills. New medicare beneficiaries (those who have justturned 65) are guaranteed the right to purchase medigap insuranceat the same rate regardless of their health status.MedicaidMedicaid is a Federal-State matching entitlement program thatprovides medical benefits to low-income individuals including theelderly, blind, disabled, children, adults with dependent children,and some pregnant women. Eligibility for medicaid has been tied toparticipation in the aid to families with dependent children (AFDC)or supplemental security income program. In 1986, the Congressextended medicaid coverage to pregnant women and childrenunder 6 whose family incomes fall below 133 percent of the Federalpoverty level. States may choose to cover all pregnant women andall children under the age of 1 with family incomes of up to 185percent of the Federal poverty level, and 29 States currently do so.By 2002, the medicaid program will be required to provide coveragefor all children under 18 whose families are below the Federal pov-erty line.For some senior citizens whose incomes are below the povertyline and who receive medicare benefits, medicaid pays deductiblesand copayments for physician and hospital expenses. Medicaid alsocovers long-term nursing home care: some 25 percent of all medic-aid expenses in 1987 were for nursing home care for those over 65.Each State administers its own medicaid program according toFederal eligibility guidelines. The Federql Government contributes50 percent of the State's administrative costs and a percentage ofthe medical expenses based on a matching formula that gives moremoney to poor than to wealthy States. The Federal share of medic-aid costs ranges from a low of 50 percent to a high of 79 percent.Federal law mandates that medicaid beneficiaries can be requiredto pay only small copayments.In 1990, 25.3 million persons received medicaid benefits. Expendi-tures for the aged, blind, and disabled, who account for only 27 per- 4 4,128 37 cent of the caseload, made up about 70 percent of the outlays. De-pendent children accounted for only 14 percent of medicaid outlays.RECENT CHANGES IN THE PROVISION OF CAREUntil the late 1970s, most providers of health care in the UnitedStates were paid using a system called retrospective reimburse-ment that paid for each service provided, encouraging providers toincrease their services. Hospitals and physicians had incentives tocounsel patients to accept more and costlier treatments, and in-sured patients had little reason to question these recommendationsbecause services were paid for largely by insurance. Physicians andhospitals competed for patients by improving the quality of theirservices, driving up prices.During the 1980s, some attempts were made to control expendi-tures by encouraging physicians and hospitals to compete in waysthat keep costs down. Competition among insurers led to an in-crease in the use of innovative payment methods that, in turn,have begun to create an environment in which competition amongproviders may lead to lower health care costs.Institutional Responses: Capitation and Coordinated CareUnder retrospective reimbursement, insurers paid physiciansand hospitals for the costs of services after the fact. There were fewrestrictions on payments, and providers had little reason to com-pare the costs and benefits of services for insured patients. Insurersusing the retrospective reimbursement system responded to rapidlyrising expenditures by reviewing physician behavior more closely.This oversight has taken different forms, including increased moni-toring, or case management, for more costly cases (a procedureused by an estimated 67 percent of employers in 1991) and require-ments that patients seek a second opinion before undergoing sur-gery (used by about 49 percent of employers in 1991).As health care expenditures rose during the 1970s and 1980s,however, insurers also experimented with alternative reimburse-ment strategies that would create incentives to control expendi-tures while ensuring quality care. One major innovation was theexpansion of coordinated care programs that use capitation-basedreimbursement and direct review of the utilization of medical andhospital services (Box 4-4).Under capitation-based reimbursement, physicians receive anannual payment for each patient in their care, regardless of theservices a patient uses during the year. Coordinated care organiza-tions, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs) andpreferred provider organizations, often use the capitation system topay providers. By 1990, 33 million Americans were receiving carethrough HMOs, over 5 times as many as had 15 years earlier. 129 3 :t. 38 Boz 4-4.Coordinated CareThe term \"coordinated care\" dawning a variety of arrange-ments that increase coordinatien and management of healthcare services. The beeteknown form of coordinated care is theHMO, which provides its services through a single group ofdoctors and other health care providers. Individuals enrolled inan HMO pay a specific annual fee, regardless of the servicesthey receive, although a small comment is sometimescharged for services.Another popular form of Coordinated care is the preferredprovider organization, which contracts with a group of provid-ers who are reimbursed for arvicm based an a negotiated feeschedule. Preferred provider organisations usually incorporateprograms to monitor the use et services to ensure that physi-cians do not offset lower kris With increased volume.Coordinated care programs have been shown to reducependitures while maintaining the quality of care. Some studier..have found that coordiiiaW nduced tb.4,104_ care by Mfpercent.,Although coordinated Jew beceme increwingly common_in the private sector, it 'has not been se popular in public in-surance programs. Medicare began entering into .contractswith HMOs in the mid-1980s. 'Beam\" medicare beneficiarieshave few incentives to join HMOs, however,' very few havedone so. Congressional restriCtions on the use of coordinetedcare by State medicaid programs have impeded the growth ofsuch arrangements for medicaid recipients and fewer than 10percent of medicaid beneficiaries currently receive carethrough these arrangements. These innovations, which have occurred largely in the private in-surance market, have reduced health care expenditures while offer-ing health care that is at least as good as that of traditional retro-spectively reimbursed medicine. In fact, capitation-based paymentgives physicians a financial incentive to invest in preventive care,because they benefit financially when their patients remainhealthy. Studies show that costs have risen more slowly in healthcare markets where there is vigorous competition among many co-ordinated care providers.Diagnosis-Related GroupsIn an effort to control rising hospital expenses, which make upthe bulk of medicare payments, the Federal Government in 1983replaced the existing retrospective payment system with a prospec- 130 4 4BEST COPY AVAILABLE 39 tive payment system. The new system reimburses hospitals with afixed amount for each patient based on the patient's diagnosis,rather than on the services provided. A medicare patient admittedto a hospital is now classified as belonging to one of 470 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) that form the basis for payment.In principle, hospitals could compete to offer care for a particularDRG at the lowest price. The medicare program, however, has setfees for each DRG, limiting the opportunities for price competitionamong hospitals. Payment for each DRG is based on the averagecost of treatment but may vary according to region and type of hos-pital. Hospitals that can provide care at less than the average costprofit from this system.Hospitals have responded to the new incentives the DRG systemprovides. The length of the average hospital stay has fallen signifi-cantly. A study that compared hospital costs under DRGs with esti-mates of what costs would have been without DRGs suggests thatthe system led to a one-time decline of about 20 percent of the costof hospital care paid for by medicare. The DRG system may alsoslow increases in expenditures by removing the incentive that oper-ated under retrospective reimbursement to add costly services. Fi-nally, a substantial amount of evidence suggests that the DRGsystem has not reduced the quality of care medicare patients re-ceive, even though it provides hospitals with an incentive to limitthe services provided to a patient with a particular diagnosis.The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale for PayingPhysiciansIn response to the increases in physician expenditures during the1980s, the medicare program in 1992 began implementing a newfee system for physicians. The old system had reimbursed physi-cians the customary fee, a practice that could lead to cost spirals. Ifone physician raised fees, the average would rise, and this increasecould be included in the next fee schedule.With the new resource-based relative value scale, the FederalGovernment sets the fee medicare pays for each service accordingto the complexity and duration of the treatment. The current scalehas greatly increased the reimbursement for evaluative functionsand red.._ ced the reimbursement for surgeUnfortunately, the method used to determine the new fee sched-ule may not be sound. Theoretically, fees should reflect not onlytime and effort but also demand for the service and the willingnessof physicians to perform it. Unless a fee schedule takes into ac- count these fundamental economic forces, it is likely to lead toshortages and surpluses in particular specialties, especially thosewith changing technology. 131 40 SUMMARYImprovements in technology and behavioral changes have ledto significant improvements in Americans' overall health.Americans are living longer, healthier lives, free from manylife-threatening illnesses. Many serious problems have devel-oped, however, including AIDS and a recurrence of tuberculo-sis.The government's share of total health expenditures has in-creased and the share of patient out-of-pocket spending in totalhealth expenses has been falling. People have much less re-sponsibility for the financial consequences of their health caredecisions than they did thirty years ago.Most Americans are insured through their employers. Employ-er-provided insurance benefits have increased dramaticallysince World War II, in part because such benefits are excludedfrom employees' taxable income. Employees pay for increasesin health care costs mainly through lower wages. Individualexpenditures for deductibles, copayments, and insurance pre-miums remained roughly constant as a siare of after-taxincome between 1972 and 1989.Insurers have responded to cost increases with innovativechanges in the financing of care, moving away from fee-for-service, retrospective reimbursement of independent providersto prospective, capitation-based reimbursement of networks ofproviders.RISING EXPENDITURES, DECLINING INSURANCECOVERAGEThe impetus for health care reform is driven by two concerns:the rapid rise in health care expenditures and the increasing per-centage of Americans who lack health insurance.TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURESChart 4-3 shows the change in spending on health care since1960. Some increases were due to the expansion of health insur-ance benefits through the establishment of the medicaid and medi-care programs in the mid-1960s. Health care spending has contin-ued to escalate since then.Studies that examine patterns of health care spending acrosscountries show that the share of income countries devote to healthcare usually rises with national income. Health expenditures in theUnited States are no exception. Expenditures rose more quicklythan incomes between 1960 and 1990, from 5 percent of gross na-tional product (GNP) in 1960 to 12 percent. 132 41 Chart 4-3Reel Per Capita Health Caro ExpendituresReal per capita health care expenditures have been rising at an average annual rate of 4.6percent since 1960.1990 are deflated by nonmedical care component of CPI-U Growth rate of lop trendis 4.6 percent per year.Sources. Department of Law, and Organintion thr Economic Cooperation and Doyeloprrient.Health expenditures are not greatly affected by short-termchanges in economic conditions. Health care costs often continue togrow during economic downturns, so that the share of nationalincome devoted to health care may rise during a recession and fallwhen prosperity returns.HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES IN OTHER DEVELOPEDCOUNTRIESAmerica is not alone: Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, andother industrialized countries all experienced large increases inhealth care spending between 1960 and 1990. As Chart 4-4 shows,spending in Germany increased rapidly between 1960 and 1980, butslowed sharply in the 1980s. In Canada, the United Kingdom, andthe United States, expenditures increased rapidly in all three dec-ades. Although outlays for health care have increased substantiallyin all four countries, per capita health care spending in the UnitedStates has historically been considerably higher than in the otherthree countries. The United States currently spends about 1.5times as much on per capita health care as Canada, about 1.7 times 133 A-1 42 as much as Germany, and about 2.6 times as much as the UnitedKingdom.

Organization for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentThe rapid growth in health care spending in the United States,Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom is somewhat surpris-ing because fh2se countries have very different systems of healthcare financing and provision. As health care expenditures continueto increase, each of these countries is considering health carereform. In some cases, these reform proposals include incorporatingfeatures of U.S. health care financing and provision. The UnitedKingdom and Canada have been experimenting with coordinatedcare systems, the United Kingdom has been developing versions ofDRGs, while Germany. has been increasing the use of patient copay-ments.THE UNINSUREDBesides rising costs, the other major problem in U.S. health carehas been the increasing number of Americans who lack insur-anceover 35 million people, according to current estimates. Be-cause so many Americans receive health insurance through theiremployers, the percentage of Americans without health insuranceis affected by changes in employment. The number of uninsured, 43134 43 however, increased during the 1980s, even during periods of eco- nomic growth.Who Are the Uninsured?Although medicaid covers many of the very poor, about 47 per- cent of those with incomes below the poverty line, the probability of being uninsured is highest among those with low incomes. As in- comes rise, so does the probability of having health insurance.Those in the 18-35 age group are more likely to be uninsured than those of other ages. These young adults, mast in good health, may have been covered previously by their parents' health insur-ance. Young adults who work are more likely than other workersnot to accept health insurance coverage even when their employers offer it, and young adults who lose their jobs are the least likely to pay to retain their health insurance.Most uninsured people report that their health is good or excel- lent relative to others of thesame age. The population of unin- sured Americans, however, also contains a group that is much sicker than average, with serious chronic health conditions. The chronically ill, who are very likely to incur high health care costs, may find it very costly to obtain insurance.Other Problems with Insurance CoverageHealth insurance is alsoa concern for people with limited insur-ance coverage and for those whose insurance ties them to a specific employer. Some people with insurance are susceptible to large out- of-pocket expenses, either as copayments or for services that their insurance does not cover. Estimates from the mid-1980s suggest that 7 percent of privately insured Americans under the age of 65 face a 1-percent chance of spending at least one-fifth of their family income on health care. Over 20 percent of those over 65 have not purchased supplementary medigap policies that cover medicare co- payments and do not qualify for medicaid; they also niay be subject to substantial financial burdens if they become seriously ill. Those whose health insurance ties them to a specific employer face a different problem. Most private health insurance contracts contain preexisting condition clauses limiting or excluding cover- age for conditions that began before the policy went into effect. These restrictions can force people with chronic conditions to stay with one job when they would prefer to move to another. Even those without chronic conditions may avoid changing jobs because they prefer to stay with one insurer. A recent survey found that over 25 percent of American households included a family member who stayed in a job because of health coverage.Gaps in Employer-Provided Health Insurance Coverage Although not having a job greatly increases the probability that an individual is not insured, the majority of uninsured Americans 135 State-mandated benefits and paying State premi-um taxes under the Federal Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct (ERISA). Third, risk-spreading, which keeps costs down by pool-ing the cost of possible serious health problems among a largegroup is more difficult in smaller firms. When one employee of asmall enterprise becomes seriously ill, the cost of premiums for theentire group increases much more than it would in a larger group.This last observation is a matter of concern. The purpose of in-surance should be to spread risk so that premiums do not increasein small groups when an employee becomes ill. To improve risk-spreading, small firms could purchase health insurance policiesthat remained in force for 5 or 10 years, rather than the 1-yearcontracts that are now customary. High employee turnover ratesand high business failure rates in small firms, however, may makeit costly for insurers and firms to make such contracts. Further-more, continuing changes in medical technology may make it riskyfor insurance companies to offer long-term contracts.Firms are considerably less likely to offer health insurance totheir part-time employees than to their full-time employees, mainlybecause coverage for a part-time employee costs as much as it doesfor a full-time employee and accounts for a much high, r share ofpart-time workers' total compensation.HOW THE UNINSURED USE HEALTH CARE SERVICESThose who lack insurance do not necessarily forgo all healthcare. They may pay for care directly or may receive it for free, pri-marily through hospitals. In 1989, U.S. hospitals provided over $10billion worth of free, or uncompensated, care. People withouthealth insurance do use less health care than those with similarhealth problems who are insured, however.People without health insurance are far more likely than thosewith insurance to report that they did not receive health careduring an illness because of financial constraints. Those who doseek care are more likely to receive it in inappropriate and costlysettings such as emergency rooms. The uninsured are likely to besicker when they are admitted to a hospital; they are also likely tobe discharged from the hospital earlier than their insured counter-parts.New estimates suggest that out-of-pocket health expendituresamong the uninsured are lower than they are among insuredpeople with similar incomes and are far less than the cost of pur-chasing a basic health insurance policy. Some uninsured peoplemay be consciously choosing to rely on emergency room care andpersonal savings rather than purchasing costly health insurancecoverage. 137 46 RECENT CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF UNINSUREDMany of the uninsured are unemployed. Although the Consoli-dated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act allows those who leavejobs to continue their coverage for up to 18 months through theiremployer's health care plan by paying the full cost of the premium,only about 20 percent of those eligible do so. Structural changes inthe American labor market have also affected insurance coverage.Workers are most likely to be covered by health insurance if theyare unionized or employed in the manufacturing sector. But em-ployment in manufacturing fell from 23 percent to 18 percent oftotal employment during the 1980s, while the fraction of privatesector workers represented by a union fell from 19 percent to 13percent between 1983 and 1991.These changes in the composition of the labor force, however, ex-plain only a small percentage of the increase in the number of un-insured. As health insurance becomes more costly, more peoplemay find it makes sense for them to seek higher wages rather thanhealth insurance from their employers, relying instead on emer-gency care.Low-Wage Jobs and Health InsuranceFor employers offering jobs at low wages, increases in the cost ofhealth insurance make it especially difficult to offer coverage.These employers cannot lower wages to help pay for health insur-ance, because wages would then fall below the legal minimum.Studies suggest that, in 1989, about one-third of all uninsuredAmerican wor;xers earned wages which, if reduced by the cost ofhealth insurance, would fall below the legal minimum. Requiringemployers to provde these workers with health insurance is likely tolead to increased unemployment among low-wage workers.SUMMARYSpending on health care has been rising steadily, both in abso-lute terms and as a share of national income. Since 1960,spending on health care has also risen rapidly in other devel-oped countries, but the per capita cost of health care is muchhigher in the United States than in other developed countries.The number of uninsured has increased recently. Part of thisincrease is due to the economic slowdown, while part is due toa long-term decline in employer-sponsored health insurance.The uninsured are poorer and younger, on average, than theinsured. Although most are in good health, some are chronical-ly ill. The uninsured do receive some health care, but they re-ceive less than those with insurance and often receive care inemergency rooms. Out-of-pocket health expenditures among 52138 47 the uninsured are lower than among insured people with simi-lar incomes.Many of the uninsured are workers employed by small firms.A substantial fraction of uninsured workers earn wages which, if reduced by the cost of health insurance, would fall belowminimum wage. Requiring employers to provide insurance tothese workers would lead to increased unemployment.ECONOMIC THEORY OF THE HEALTH CAREMARKETEconomic analysis can help explain much of the recent perform-ance of the American health care market and the problems thathave emerged. Providers and purchasers of health care services re- spond to the incentives and restrictions they face, which stem fromboth the nature of health care itself and the way it is financed anddelivered.PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICESTwo features of health care provision have significant implica-tions for costs. First, it is difficult for consumers to evaluate thequality of health care services. They rely on the advice of the pro- vider of the service in deciding what to buy. While the lack of inde-pendent information is not unique to the health care market (car owners may rely on mechanics), it can lead to the unwitting pur-chase of unnecessary, poor quality, or high-cost services.Second, to protect consumers from unscrupulous or incompetent providers, licensing boards in every State regulate those who workm health care. The licensing procedure can increase the price ofservices by restricting the number of providers and limiting the ways that they may compete.PROBLEMS OF MEASURING QUALITYPhysicians have much more information about treating a par- ticular illness than their patients do. Patients may find it difficult to evaluate their treatment; if they get better, they may not be able to tell whether they have enjoyed a natural recovery or espe- cially effective treatment. Lack of information can make it difficult for people to make decisions about purchasing health care. A physi- cian could charge a low fee either because the services are provided in the most cost-saving way or because they are not performed properly.People have tried to overcome this problem by evaluating a pri- mary care physicianasking for recommendations from friends,for exampleand then accepting the primary care physician's advice on further treatment. But friends may not be able to assess 139 48 quality accurately; their advice may be particularly deficient inevaluating the services of a group of doctors ii. a coordinated careorganization.Information about provider quality is especially important be-cause of the enormous variation in the way American doctors treatpatients with similar problems. For example, rates of use of somediscretionary procedures, such as tonsillectomies, can be ten timesas high in one county as in a neighboring county with a similarpopulation. In many cases, the use of such procedures deviates sub-stantially from what experts recommend. Rates of mortality for pa-tients with similar problems also differ considerably among hospi-tals.'These variations suggest that if consumers could better evaluatetheir care, the quality of care could be improved substantially andcosts could be reduced. Physicians and hospitals that offer low-qual-ity care at high prices would face strvnger incentives to improvequality and reduce costs.Improving the Quality of InformationWithout a reasonably accurate way to measure quality, healthcare plans, hospitals, and providers have a difficult time competingon the basis of the price of services they offer. But developing suchinformation may not make economic sense for any single healthcare provider or insurer, since setting up a system of gathering anddisseminating information would be costly and, once developed,might well be copied. The tax treatment of employer-provided in-surance and the government's growing role in health care provi-sion have also limited the incentives for private insurers and pro-viders to develop ways to compete 'by providing high-quality, low-cost care.Despite these impediments, insurers and employers have recent-ly been working together to develop systems for measuring thequality of health care provided. The Federal Government haslaunched a major initiative with the publication of mortality rates(adjusted for the severity of patient illness) for medicare patients inU.S. hospitals. A variety of other groups are providing informationin health care markets, including a group that publishes an annualguide to Washington-area Federal employee health plans; thePennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, which pub-lishes information about hospital charges and mortality rates; anda group of employers in Cleveland that sponsors the ClevelandHealth Quality Choice Project, which is developing measures tocompare the quality of care in Cleveland-area hospitals.THE SUPPLY OF PROVIDERSIn many industries, costs rise when the necessary skilled person-nel and materials are in short supply. In most cases, such short- t.1140 Ii49term shortages cause wages to rise, attracting new supplies of skilled workers. Shortages and the high wages that they produce are unlikely to persist over time. High physician incomes mightpersist, however, without leading to an increased supply of doctors,because the medical profession can, to some extent, regulate the number of new physicians receiving licenses each year. In the past, physicians' associations have also kept doctors fromcompeting on the basis of price. Until 1982, these organizations re- stricted their members' ability to advertise services. For many years, professional associations controlled the types of fee arrange-ments that doctors could accept, stifling the growth of coordinatedcare. These problems are less serious today. The number of practic-ing doctors has increased greatly and the profession's ability to limit price competition has declined.HEALTH INSURANCEThe need for health care depends, in part, on somewhat unpre- dictable and costly events, such as a serious illness or accident. People can respond to the risk of such possibilities by self-insuring,or saving money to pay for potential expenses; by investing in pre- ventive health care; or by purchasing health insurance.Insurance is most valuable when it protects people against uncer- tain events that carry a high risk of substantial financial loss. Thus, early insurance plans were set up to cover costly hospital ex- penses. By 1960, insurance covered most hospital care, but peoplegenerally paid for other services themselves. In recent years, how- ever, insurance coverage has expanded to cover other services. Theshare of out-of-pocket expenses for relatively predictable and inex- pensive services (such as physician services, dental care, and phar- maceuticals) has been declining steadily (Chart 4-6).Insurance can Lead to Overconsumption of ServicesAll insurance, whether privately or publicly provided, affects the incentives of the insured. Because they are protected against the full cost of a serious illnessor injury, the insured have less incen-tive to take steps to limit the losses associated with such events. The change in incentives that results from the purchase of insur- ance is known by economists as \"moral hazard.\" To economists, the term carries no connotation of dishonesty.Moral hazard typically refers to a reduction in the incentive to avoid undesirable events. For example, people insured against car theft may leave their doors unlocked, increasing the chance that their cars may be stolen. People with health insurance may be just as careful as the uninsured about avoiding health risks, but they also respond to the incentives produced through insurance by using more health care services. They are likely to go to the doctor more often and choose more complex procedures. Among health econo- 141 50 Chart 4-6 Share of Health Care Expenses Paid Out of PockatThe share of expenses paid out of pocket varies considerably among selvices but has beendeclining since 1960 for all services. HOSP.101Physician1960 al 1970 Sow.. Health Care Financing Administration.Dental1980 0 1990Drug mists, the term moral hazard has come to include this incentive forthe overconsumption of health care services, which adds to totalhealth care costs.Studies suggest that the overconsumption of services due tomoral hazard is an important factor in rising health care costs.One study in the 1970s gave one group of randomly selected fami-lies health .insurance policies that provided them with full insur-ance for all health care services and another group a catastrophichealth insurance plan and a corresponding cash payment (for ex-ample, a health insurance policy with a $1,000 deductible togetherwith a cash payment of $1,000). Although both families were equal-ly well indemnified, those who were fully insured used nearly 30percent more services than those with the catastrophic insuranceplan. According to most measures of health status, families in bothgroups were equally healthy at the end of the 3 to 5-year experi-ment.Responses to Moral HazardBecause people with insurance pay less than the full cost of in-sured services, moral hazard suggests they may use services thatthey would not have chosen to purchase if they had to pay the full 56142 51 cost. But by using these additional services, policyholders drive up the cost of insurance. Ultimately, they pay the full expected cost of these additional services through higher insurance premiums. Yet many consumers would prefer less expensive insurance policies that encourage them to use only those services that they value most highly.Insurers have two well-knownways to limit the potential re- sponse to moral hazard in their policiec and keep premium costs down. Traditionally, they have required those with insurance to pay for part of their services through deductibles and copayments. Even with deductibles and copayments for a particular service, however, the price an insured patient pays for services will gener- ally be less than the full cost.Another response to moral hazard involves monitoring policy- holders to ensure that theyare taking appropriate preventive measures and to cap the services that they can use if an illness or injury occurs. By monitoring services and encouraging preventive care, the insurer can try to restrict the policyholder to only those services that are worth their full cost. Coordinated care organiza- tions take this approach. These organizations typically charge low copayments and deductibles but closely monitor the utilization of health care services among those who are ill and often provide free preventive care services. Conventional insurers have also begun to adopt these monitoring practices, for example, by requiring a second opinion for surgery.Using Private Information in Purchasing Insurance People usually know more than insurance companies about their own health and their need for health care services. This asymme- try of information has important implications for the health insur- ance market. An insurer charges a premium based on the average need for health care services. For those who anticipate that their need for health care services will be higher than average, health insurance is a bargain. But those who anticipate that their need for health care services will be below average may find health insur- ance a poor investment. They may choose .to pay for their health care themselves or to purchase a health insurance policy with very high deductibles and copayments. This process is known as adverse selection.If those at low risk drop out of the health insurance market, the average premiums for the remaining purchasers willrise.In theory, if the adverse selection process continues, the market for insurance may disappear altogether as healthier people decline in- creasingly expensive insurance. Alternatively, people may sort themselves into high- and low-risk groups and purchase different kinds of insurance. If thisoccurs, those at high risk will purchasecomprehensive health insurance plans and face premiums that re- 143 1_4 6 52 fleet the full costs associated with iheir true health status. Low-riskindividuals will purchase less comprehensive insurance, paying lowpremiums that reflect both the type of plan they purchase and theirhealth status.Economic theory suggests that adverse selection can lead tolower levels of health insurance coverage for the relatively healthy.Studies also support this finding. Among firms offering multiplehealth insurance plans, premiums for comprehensive coverage aremuch higher than premiums for plans with high deductibles andcopayments. These higher premiums are not fully explained by thefact that comprehensive plans offer additional services or by theeffects of moral hazard. Rather, evidence suggests that those whochoose the comprehensive plans are in poorer health than those whochoose plans requiring high out-of-pocket payments.The theory of adverse selection can also explain some character-istics of the uninsured. For example, the uninsured appear to havea low propensity to use medical services. When currently unin-sured people obtain insurance, they use, on average, fewer servicesthan those who are continuously insured.CONCERNS OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICALRESOURCESAsymmetries of information, whether between insurers and pol-icyholders or providers and patients, can cause problems in thehealth care market. Consequently, some people will not be able topurchase insurance, and some patients willing to pay for bettercare will not be able to find it. But even if these asymmetries couldbe eliminated, health care would still be costly. Some Americans,especially those who are poor or who have chronic health condi-tions, would still find it very difficult to purchase health insurance.Risk SelectionPrivate insurers compete to offer people the lowest price fortheir health coverage. One way to offer a better bargain to peoplewith lower-than-average health risks is to adjust the price of insur-ance offered to them to reflect only the cost of the health servicesthey can be expected to purchase. If insurers can observe the riskcharacteristics of those they insure, they can charge these low-riskpeople low premiums. People at high risk would be charged highpremiums that reflect all the costs they could be expected to incur.People with chronic health conditions may be excluded fromcommercial health insurance coverage due te preexisting conditionclauses. If they are able to find coverage, they are likely to becharged very high rates that correspond to their expected healthcosts. Ironically, improvements in diagnostic and managementtechnology may make it even harder for some people to obtain 144 53 health insurance, as insurance companies become better able to di- agnose and screen out those with chronic health problems.If insurers are required to charge all purchasers of health insur- ance in a community the same premiums (a practice known as com- munity rating), they are prevented from responding to even readily observable health characteristics by raising or lowering prices. Yet these insurers will still try to compete by offering low prices to those at low risk. They may do this by directly refusing to provide cover- age to those at high risk, a practice called risk selection. Alterna- tively, they may use adverse selection to their advantage, selling low-priced insurance contracts with restricted services or high copay- ment rates that appeal to those at low risk but would not be chosen by those at high risk.Health Care for the Poor and IllThe unequal distribution of health care is an important policy concern. Most Americans believe that everyone should be entitled to at least basic health care, regardless of income or health status. This belief distinguishes the health care sector from most other parts of the U.S. economy and explains why charitable organiza- tions have always playedan important role in health care. Publicand voluntary hospitals continue to provide, to some extent, a health care safety net that ironically causes other problems in the health insurance market.First, because this safety net operates principally through hospi- tal emergency rooms, most of the uninsured receive care only when their conditions are quite serious, although more effective care could often be provided earlier in the course of their illness. Fur- thermore, providingemergency care through hospitals is likely tobe much more costly than providing preventive care in an outpa- tient setting.Second, although most Americans agree that everyone should re- ceive basic health care, the safety net does not force all Americans te share the burden of thiscare equally. Instead, the costs may fallon those who use hospitals that charge high fees to paying patients in order to cover the cost of the uninsured.Finally, the existence of the safety net may discourage some people from purchasing health insurance, especially those with se- rious health conditions who must pay very high premiums and those in very good health who do not expect to use services at all. For these people, remaining uninsured may be better than pur- chasing insurance because they know that they will not be turned away if and when they need care.Unfortunately, programs that help low-income people purchase health insurance can also have some undesirable effects. As family incomes rise, support under income-tested health programs is phased out. As with similar provisions in other governmentpro- 145r 54 grams (such as aid to families with dependent children), this phase-out means that poor families may face a very high marginal \"tax\"rate. Small increases in their income are accompanied by large re-ductions in the value of the health care and other support they re-ceive. Such high taxes may discourage people from trying to increasetheir incomes.SUMMARYA lack of information may lead patients to spend money onservices they might not choose if they were fully informed. Pri-',ate and public initiatives are underway to improve the qual-Ay of health care information.Health insurance reduces the price of health care services forpolicyholders. Thus it can lead to the overconsumption ofhealth carethat is, the use of services whose full costs exceedtheir benefit to the consumer.When policyholders have more information about their ownhealth status than do insurers (or than insurers are permittedto use), adverse selectionwhich may cause the healthiestpeople to opt out of the health insurance marketmay occur.The existing safety net for the uninsured is problematic. Theuninsured receive insufficient and often inappropriate forms ofcare and have few incentives to purchase insurance.WHY ARE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURESINCREASING?An economic analysis of the structure of the U.S. health caremarket can help to explain why health care expenditures haverisen so sharply. The tax subsidy for health insurance has encour-aged employers to provide employees with coverage that includesvery low copayments and deductibles and covers relatively predict-able and inexpensive services. Most people covered bygotr-ernment insurance programs (medicare and medicaid) also makelow out-of-pocket payments. Although substantial out-of-pocket pay-ments are required in the medicare program, most beneficiarieshave medigap policies that cover many of these costs. Out-of-pocketpayments for health care as a share of all health expenditureshave been falling, reducing the incentive for consumers to limittheir use of health care services. For example, studies show that, atcurrent levels, medigap insurance increases health care utilizationby up to 24 percent.The open-ended nature of health insurance contracts means thatmost new nonexperimental technologies will be covered by existingpolicies. As a result, expensive new technologies covered by insur- 146 55 ance may be introduced before consumers would otherwise be will-ing to pay for them, further contributing to the escalation of costs.PRICES AND QUANTITIES OF HEALTH CAREThe Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency that administers medicare and medicaid, has developed a price index for personal health care expenditures that measures the cost of all health care services, regardless of who pays for them. Divid- ing total spending on health care by this price index produces a composite measure of the quantity of the various health care serv- ices people consume, including physician visits, hospital care, and drug purchases.Two factors affect the price index: changes in the economy's gen- eral inflation rate and deviations in the price of health care serv- ices from the general rate of inflation. Table 4-1 provides measures of changes in total healthcare expenditures and divides these intochanges in economywide prices, real health care expenditures, health care prices in excess of economywide inflation, and quanti- ties of health care consumed.

The personal health care price index basket includes hospital care, physician services, drugs, and other health-related products. The index reflects changes in the cost of this broad basket, not the price of a particular service provided by a hospital or physician.The pricy index does not adequately reflect improvements in the quality ofcommodities or services, which usually appear as price increases. For example, total expenditures for a hospital day go up if the number of nursing visits made during that hospital day increases. While sucha change implies that the quality of aday in the hospital has improved, it appears only as an increase in the health care price index.

RECENT INCREASES IN HEALTH CAREEXPENDITURESU.S. health care expenditures have risen continuously since the1980s, not only because health care prices have gone up but be-cause Americans are using more services. In the 1980s, real healthcare spending grew more slowly than it had during the precedingtwo decades. Growth was split evenly between increases in thequantity of health care consumed (2.2 percent annually) and in-creases in the health care price index in excess of general inflation(2.3 percent annually) (Table 4-1).Economic theory suggests that when prices rise people usuallyconsume less of a good or service. Yet the price of health care andthe quantity purchased rose in tandem during the 1980s (as well asin earlier decades). These concurrent increases in price and quanti-ty are consistent with the view that the quality of health carechanged during the 1980s. Consumers in 1990 were probably notbuying more 1980-style health care at 1990 prices; rather, theywere willing to pay more for 1990-style health care than they hadbeen willing to pay for 1980-style health care. The changes thatwere measured in quantity and price hid underlying changes inquality. 148 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 57 The quantity of health care services consumed increased primari-ly because of greater use of outpatient and physician care in the 1980s. The growth rate of inpatient hospital spending declined be- tween 1982 and 1986, largely because of changes in the system of medicare reimbursement. Although inpatient hospital services are now paid prospectively, outpatient services for medicare continueto be paid on a less constraining retrospective basis, giving hospi-tals a considerable incentive to move procedures from an inpatient to an outpatient setting.The health care sector responded in a flexible and rapid way to this changed incentive. In 1980 only 16 percent of surgeries in short-stay hospitals were performed on an outpatient basis, but by 1989, 49 percent were conducted on an outpatient basis. The poten- tial for such responses needs to be taken into account in the devel- opment of health policy.COMPONENTS OF PRICE INCREASES IN THE 1980sThe health care price index increased throughout the 1980s.Price increases measured were due, in part, to increased use of ex- pensive technologies and to changes in the cost and.types of labor used in health care. As insurers and providers competed by offer- ing more generous coverage, technology, and high quality care, costs rose.Physician Costs in the 1980sIn the late 1980s, physician costs rose more rapidly than other major components of health care spending, in part because of an increase in the use of outpatient diagnostic and treatment facili-ties, some of them owned by physicians. Studies suggest that physi- cians order more tests when they own a share in diagnostic and treatment facilities. These private facilities may be more conven- ient, but physicians may also be motivated by the incentives cre- ated by the traditional insurance system, which pays physicians for each service they provideincluding those provided by diagnostic and treatment facilities that they own. This practice may be curtailed by regulations stemming from the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. The act, in- tended to improve the quality of laboratory tests, imposes very costly regulations on the operation of laboratories. But these regu- lations may not significantly improve the quality of health care and, in fact, may impose additional costs on patients whose physi- cians operate small-scale office-based laboratories.U.S. physicians became,on average, more highly specializedduring the 3 decades leading up to 1990, especially before 1980. In 1965 24 percent of U.S. physicians were general practitioners. By 1990 only 12 percent of U.S. physicians were general practitioners; the other 88 percent were specialists, a much higher percentage 149 58 than in other countries, such as Canada. Specialists are usuallymore highly paid than general practitioners, and the pay differen-tial expanded during the 1980s as the demand grew for new diagnosticand surgical procedures only specialists can provide.Nursing Costs in the 1980sIn the early 1980s, salaries for nurses were low compared withthose for other occupations requiring similar levels of skill, discour-aging some qualified applicants from entering nursing school. In aneffort to attract more nurses, hospitals increased nurses' real wages.Between January 1980 and January 1990, the real hourly earnings ofprivate hospital employees rose about 25 percent (excluding thevalue of nonwage compensation), while the earnings of all privatesector workers changed little. Registered nurses were among thosehospital employees receiving the largest pay increases during the1980s. At the same time, reductions in the length of the averagehospital stay and increased use of outpatient surgery meant thatpatients who were admitted and kept in hospitals were, on average,sicker than those admitted in 1980. Hospitals were forced to increasethe ratio of highly skilled registered nurses to patients in order tomaintain the quality of their services.Medical Technology in the 1980sIncreased use of costly medical technology also had an importantimpact on measured health care prices in the 1980s. Between 1980and 1990, for instance, the number of computerized axial tomogra-phy (CAT) scans performed in short-stay hospitals in the UnitedStates increased over 400 percent. The number of community hospi-tals with magnetic resonance imagery equipment rose 500 percent be-tween 1984 and 1991. Many of these new technologies also prolifer-ated in nonhospital settings.The use of new surgical techniques flourished in the 1980s. Forexample, in 1980, 1 in every 400 American men aged 65 and overhad coronary artery bypass surgery. In 1990, about 1 in 100 Ameri-can men in the same age group had this form of surgery.The Costs of Malpractice LitigationThe increasing costs associated with medical malpractice suitshave been an important factor in rising health care costs. Between1982 and 1989, doctors' liability premiums, the principal source ofpayment for malpractice claims, grew at 15 percent annually,faster than any other component of medical practice costs. Anothermore insidious effect of malpractice suits is that they may compelphysicians to perform tests that are not cost-effective simply to pro-tect themselves from legal actions. The costs of defensive medicalpractices have been estimated at over $20 billion in 1989 alone, oralmost 18 percent of total physician expenditures. Finally, malprac-tice insurance costs have caused some physicians to drop out of 150 59 some specialties, such as obstetrics, making such specialists hard tofind in some communities.Although insurers and physicians spend large sums defendingthemselves in malpractice suits, relatively little of this moneymakes its way to those injured through negligence. A recent studyof malpractice cases in New York found that 16 times as many pa-tients suffered an injury from negligence as received compensationfrom the tort liability system. In 1984, only about 60 percent of themoney expended on malpractice litigation was actually paid to in-jured plaintiffs.Administrative ExpendituresThe administrative costs of the U.S. health care industry, whichare estimated at $80 billion in 1991, have been widely criticizedand unfavorably compared to the costs of administering the govern-ment-run systems in many other countries. Private insurance com-panies incur costs marketing their products, reviewing and process-ing claims, and screening and establishing the health status of po-tential enrollees. Billing individual patients or insurance compa-nies raises costs for physicians and hospitals.Recent studies find, however, that shifting to a system that elimi-nates the functions of the U.S. private insurance industry wouldresult in few overall cost reductions. Most of the administrativecost savings would be offset by increases in utilization that wouldcome from the elimination of features of the current system thatreduce overall expenditures, such as patient payments and insur-ance company oversight. In other countries with multiple insurers,such as Germany, administrative costs as a share of total healthexpenditures are comparable to those in the United States.Private insurance companies compete, in part, on the prices ofthe services they offer. A competitive insurance company, like anyother firm, can increase administrative expenses only if the bene-fits of these expenditures exceed the new expense. In health insur-ance, much of the increase in administrative expenditures has comefrom the expansion of programs that monitor service utilization,and health insurance that offers these features is cheaper than in-surance that does notdespite the administrative costs associatedwith oversight programs. Nonetheless, some of these costs, such asthe costs of assessing the health status of new enrollees, may raiseaggregate health care expenditures.PROJECHONS OF FUTURE COST INCREASESMany analysts expect that unless the health care market is sub-stantially reformed, costs will continue to rise rapidly into the nextcentury. Recent projections suggest that health care, which con-sumed 12 percent of the GNP in 1990, may rise to as much as 16 64-300 0 - 93- 3151 60 percent of GNP by the year 2000 and to 26 percent by 2030 (Chart4-7).

Because most pro-jections of health care expenditures are based mainly on mechani-cal extrapolations of past trends, they do not take into accountchanges in government programs or other individual and institu-tional responses to the rising cost of health care. During the 1980s,as health care expenses rose rapidly, insurers, employers, consum-ers, and the government responded through innovations in the fi-nancing and delivery of care. Such changes in behavior, whichcannot be captured by the modeling techniques currently in use,could have profound effects on the cost of health care.DemographicsProjected increases in health costs are, to a small extent, a conse-quence of the aging of the population. Population aging alone is ex-pected to cause health care expenditures to increase from 12 per-cent of GNP in 1990 to about 14 percent by 2030, explaining aboutone-seventh of the total projected increase in health care costs (to26 percent of GNP). The number of Americans over age 64, the age 152 61 group for which health care spending is the highest, will increasethrough 2030, especially after the turn of the century.Those over age 64 consume about 31/2 times as much healthcare as those between the ages of 19 and 64, and those over age 84consume almost 2Y2 times as much health care as those betweenthe ages of 65 and 69 (Chart 4-8). Health care spending is higheramong those over age 64 due primarily to the increased probabilityof death at this age. Health care spending is especially high in thelast year of life. The 5 percent of aged beneficiaries who were intheir last year of life accounted for 29 percent of medicare expendi-tures in 1979.

But because people who pay directly for much of this care, aswell as State governments, which both pay for care and licensenursing homes, have strong incentives to limit spending, most ana-lysts expect the growth in spending for nursing home care to beslower than the changing age composition of the population wouldsuggest. 153 62 SUMMARYBoth the price of health care and the quantity of services con-sumed increased during the 1980s. Part of the apparent in-crease in price was due to improvements in the quality of care.Labor costs, the costs of new equipment, and the use of newtreatments all contributed to the growth in expendituresduring the 1980s.Changes in administrative expenditures are unlikely to havebeen an important contributor to overall expenditure growth.Most administrative expenses reduce overall health care costs.Litigation over medical malpractice raises costs directly andencourages the practice of costly defensive medicine.Simple extrapolations of health care expenditureswhich donot take cost-cutting measures into accountsuggest that theywill consume as much as 26 percent of gross national productby 2030. A small part of this increase is due to the aging of thepopulation.PROPOSALS FOR REFORM OF THE HEALTH CAREMARKETIncreasing health care expenditures and the growing number ofuninsured in the United States have led to a proliferation of pro-posals for health care reform. In the past year, some 70 bills havebeen introduced in the Congress. While most of these plans seek toalleviate the symptoms of trouble in the health care market, rela-tively few address the underlying causes of the cost increases andinsurance gaps.As the response to the diagnosis-related group payment systemin hospitals has shown, changes in incentives can lead to majormodifications in health care provision. Because the health caresector is flexible and responsive, health reforms that address under-lying economic probkms and provide sound incentives can be veryeffective. On the other hand, reforms that ignore the economics ofhealth care are likely to lead to unexpected and undesirable results.Table 4-2 provides a summary of the main proposals for healthcare reform that are discussed below.ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALThis Administration's health care reform proposal is a compre-hensive, market-based reform plan that builds on the strengths ofthe existing market. It includes components designed both toexpand access to health insurance and to improve market function-ing. 6 ci154 63 TA/LI 4-2.--Side-by-Side Comparison or public plan.

Access to Care Under the Administration ProposalAn important objective of health care reform is to provide betteraccess to health care for the poor and those with chronic illnesses.The Administration's plan would address this objective by provid-ing these groups with the funds to purchase health insurancewithin the existing health care market at a reasonable price. Itwould provide low-income Americans with a transferable taxcredit, ranging from a maximum of $1,250 for single persons to$3,750 for families of three or more, for purchasing health insur-ance. Those who do not file tax returns would receive the credit inthe form of a transferable health insurance certificate. Middle-income people would be eligible for a tax deduction for health in-surance.The U.S. Treasury estimates that, when fully phased in (in 1997),the health insurance tax credit and deduction could benefit about90 million people. About 25 million of these potential beneficiarieswould be low-income people receiving the maximum applicablecre ';t. The credit or deduction would be reduced for those withhigher incomes: 10 million people with incomes between 100 and150 percent of the poverty level would receive a partial credit ordeduction, and 56 million middle-income individuals would receivea partial deduction.States would develop basic insurance packages equal to the valueof the health insurance credit. Each State would ensure that atleast two insurers offered such a package. Because low-income 155 64 Americans would be able to purchase basic insurance using theirtax credits, they would no longer have to rely on the public hospi-tal safety net. At the same time, the fixed-dollar nature of thecredit or deduction would not encourage overconsumption of healthinsurance. While the credit or deduction could be used toward thepurchase of plans offering other than the basic benefits, the pur-chaser would bear any additional cost of these plans.The President's plan encourages States to fold their existingmedicaid programs into the new program. Those eligible for medic-aid would receive the full individual tax credit and could then pur-chase basic benefit coverage through one of the plans offered in theState. This scheme would allow even the poorest Americans achoice in their purchase of health insurance.The plan would further expand health insurance coverage byhelping small firms buy insurance. It would promote the use ofhealth insurance networks to act as group purchasing agents forsmaller employers, obtaining more favorable premiums and reduc-ing administrative expenditures. Insurance purchased throughthese networks would be exempt from State-mandated benefits andpremium taxes.The plan would incorporate health risk pools that would spreadthe cost of serious health problems among all those purchasinghealth insurance with the tax credit or deduction or through thesmall group health insurance networks. These pools would employhealth risk adjusters (Box 4-6). This feature of the plan addressesthe concern that those with poor health conditions should be ableto purchase health insurance. Low- and middle-income people withchronic health problems would have greatly improved access tohealth care through this combination of tax credits and deductionsand health risk pools.Although health risk pools would not wholly eliminate the prob-lem of adverse selection, they would enable people with poor healthto purchase health care at reasonable cost. Under the Administra-tion's plan, people would not be required to purchase health insur-ance. Those who know that their health is unusually good and areeligible for only a partial credit or deduction could choose to forgothe credit or deduction, not purchase health insurance, and contin-ue to pay their own expenses or rely on the existing health caresafety net. The only way to eliminate this problem completelywould be to require everyone to purchase some health insurance.Finally, the plan prohibits all insurers from excluding any indi-vidual or group from health insurance coverage because of a preex-isting condition and requires insurers to renew the coverage of anypreviously insured group that complies with its insurance contract.These features of the plan would reduce existing impediments tolabor market mobility among those with preexisting health condi- 7 0156 65 Box 4-4.--Health Risk AdjustersThe health risk pools envisiowd wider the P.!Oclenes Planwould incorporate a system of health risk adjusters intended teequalize the cost of insuring those who differ only with regardto health status. Insurers serving a pool each cover differentgroups of people. Those providing coverage to group withmore than the average number of health problems would re-ceive a payment from the pool equal to the difference betweenthe expected average expenditures of that group and the aver-age expenditures of all people in the pool. An insurer provid-ing coverage to a relatively healthy group would make a corre-sponding payment into the pool.These payments would be age-group specific. Thus, youngerpeople, who tend to be quite healthy, would face lower averagepremiums than older people, who tend to have more healthproblems. That means that implementation of a health riskadjuster system would not give younger people additional incen-tives to leave the health insurance market or increase transfersfrom the young to the old. (Chapter 6 contains a discussion ofcurrent intergenerational transfers.) At the same time. thehealth risk adjuster system would leave all people with theincentive to save money for their old age.Health risk adjusters have two advantages over communityrating. First, because the payments are based on averagerather than actual expenditures, everyone has incentives tomonitor his or her own use of care. People who consistentlyuse more than the expected average amount of health care forsomeone of their health status would face higher rates thanthose who economized on their use of care. Under communityrating, the actual costs of this additional care would be spreadamong all people with insurance. Second, under a system ofhealth risk adjusters, insurers would have no incentive to denycoverage to people with chronic health conditions. Firms thatinsure only low-risk people would have to make payments intothe health risk pool to subsidize firms that insure high-riskpeople. Under community rating, insurers could profit by dis-criminating against people with chionic health conditions.Under the Administration's refetin proposal, health risk ad-justers would be phased in over a period of 5 years. Premiumbands would be implemented during the phase-in period. Pre-mium bands limit the difference in premiums that insurerscan charge groups with different average health status. Fur-ther limits on rate increases would also be in effect during thetransition to health risk pools and risk adjusters.

The plan would increase incentives touse coordinated care delivery systems within the medicare andmedicaid frameworks. It would provide both HMO and alternativecoordinated care options to medicare beneficiaries and increase fi-nancial incentives for beneficiaries to join the HMOs. The planwould require States either to shift all nonelderly medicaid benefi-ciaries into coordinated care programs or to fold all medicaid bene-ficiaries into the tax credit and deduction program.To improve the performance of the private health insurance in-dustry, the Administration's plan would address the lack of infor-mation in health care markets by requiring States to implementprograms to help make information about the cost and quality ofmedical services available to consumers. The Federal Governmentwould assist the States by developing prototype systems to assist indata gathering and outcome comparison. Informed patients aremore likely to choose providers and insurers who provide highquality services at reasonable prices.Under the Administration's plan, administrative costs would bereduced in both the private and public health insurance sectors.The proposal calls for the Federal Government to work with theprivate sector in developing record-keeping and billing forms.These reductions in billing costs, in combination with the savingsfrom reduced health status screening, could lower the total admin-istrative costs of the health care system significantly.The Administration's proposal would encourage competitionamong health plans. Because recipients of tax credits or deductions(including former medicaid recipients) would be able to choose be-tween at least two plans available in every geographic area, compe-tition between the plans would help ensure an adequate level ofservice. If one plan provided poor-quality service, those insuredcould choose another plan. States would also be encouraged toremove existing impediments to competition, such as regulationslimiting coordinated care arrangements and mandating the inclu-sion of certain benefits in insurance plans.Malpractice costs would be reduced under the proposal's compre-hensive liability reform plan. The plan would provide States withincentives to cap the amount of allowable losses for damages otherthan loss of income and the cost of health care associated with aninjury. States would be encouraged to employ systems of alterna-tive dispute resolution, which may reduce the cost of adjudicatingdisputes. The Federal Government would also intensify existing ef- 4158 67forts to create guidelines and quality standards for health carethat, when adopted by a State, could be used by the courts to deter-mine negligence. If the legal system relied on such standards, phy-sicians would no longer have to practice defensive medicine. Stand-ards could also improve the quality of care by keoping physiciansinformed about state-of-the-art treatments for particular condi-tions.The most important component of the Administration's proposalwith respect to improving health is its emphasis on prevention.The proposal calls for substantially increased spending for Federalpreventive care programs and for an expangian of primary carehealth services to low-income communities. It also increases fund-ing for programs aimed at encouraging Americans to make health-ier choices with respect to smoking, physical fitness, and diet.MANAGED COMPETITIONManaged competition reforms are intended to improve the oper-ation of the marketplace and expand the availability of employer-sponsored health insurance. Although managed competition hasmany market-oriented features, it would greatly increase the roleof the government in the health care system and would limit therange of health insurance options available to Americans. Manytypes of managed competition proposals exist; the discussion thatfollows examines one version.Managed competition is built around the \"accountable healthpartnership,\" an organization similar to an HMO that would pro-vide both health benefits and consumer information. Each account-able health partnership would be registered with a national healthboard that would monitor the insurance market.The national health board would define a set of \"uniform effec-tive health benefits\" that accountable health partnershipe wouldbe required to provide. All insurers, both private and governmental,would be required to offer the same basic benefit plan. Competitionwould focus on providing these benefits in a cost-saving and medi-cally effective fashion.With managed competition almost everyone would have healthinsurance coverage. The proposal would mandate employer-provid-ed insurance for all full-time employees. Employers would be re-quired to make a flat contribution to an insurer for each of theiremployees of between 50 and 100 percent of the cost of the mini-mum benefit package offered by the cheapest accountable healthpartnership in the area. An employee could use this money to buythis plan, a more generous plan, or a plan from a different account-able health partnership. Even healthy employees would no doubtfind it in their best interest to purchase health insurance at only 159 .3 1 68 half the premiums, so the 50-percent minimum contribution re-quirement would help to limit adverse selection.Small firms would purchase insurance through collective pur-chasing agents in each State. These purchasing agents would poolrisks and charge community rates across all small employers, al-though premiums could be age adjusted. Only those small employ-ers who joined these organizations would be able to claim tax ex-emptions for health insurance premiums.States would contract with the collective purchasing agent toinsure all part-time employees and other unemployed and unin-sured people. For these people, the premium costs of the cheapestavailable plan would be subsidized using revenues from taxes onpart-time employees and on those with independent incomes.Each State's collective purchasing agent could contract withmany accountable health partnerships, creating competition amongth'nn. The national Itr.z.14h board would be responsible for ensuringthat the agent and eacb participating accountable health partner-ship met accounting, inisurance, and benefit standards.The mechanism for cost containment under managed competi-tion is competition among accountable health partnerships overthe price of the minimum benefit package. Although people couldchoose any insurance package offered by any participating account-able health partnership as long as it included at least the mini-mum benefits, they would not be able to deduct from their taxableincome more than the cost of the minimum benefit package offeredby the cheapest accountable health partnership. This limit on thetax subsidy would encourage people to choose less comprehensivehealth insurance and efficiently run insurance plans, since theywould face the full additional cost if they chose a plan whose priceexceeded that of the lowest-priced plan. Requiring that insurersoffer at least this benefit package would mean that low-risk peoplecould not engage in adverse selection by purchasing minimal bene-fit packages that would never be chosen by those at higher risk.Because of the central role of the minimum benefit plan in thisproposal, the kinds of benefits and deductible and copayment levelsincluded in the plan would be very important. The benefits wouldhave to be designed to fit the services offered by both traditionalhealth insurers, which typically use deductibles and copayments tolimit moral hazard, and coordinated care organizations, which usefewer deductibles and copayments but tend to monitor service utili-zation directly.To avoid risk selection, the national health board would eitherneed to specify benefits in a way that would limit the ability of ac-countable health partnerships to avoid sicker-than-average peopleor implement a system of health risk adjusters. Unless they did so,insurers could avoid such people, for example, by locating their of- 160 69 floes in buildings without elevators, or by contracting only withphysicians who do not specialize in the care of costly conditions.With managed competition the government would take an activerole in selecting the basic benefit package and in defming the typeof insurance that most people would be likely to purchase. Thesegovernmental decisions could change the insurance arrangementsof many Americans, because the accountable health partnershipsenvisioned in the proposal are similar to HMOs, while most Ameri-cans are currently enrolled in traditional fee-for-service health in-surance plans. These decisions will also have a profound effectiveon the financial future of providers and insurers, who are likely topress for benefits to be defined as broadly as possible, limiting theability of managed competition to contain costs.PLAY-OR-PAYPlay-or-pay proposals for health care reform are structuredaround requirements that firms either provide basic health insur-ance to employees and their dependents (\"play\") or pay a payrolltax to cover enrollment in a public health care plan (\"pay\"). Mostplay-or-pay proposals would also offer sliding subsidies to thosewho are not attached to the work force.Play-or-pay proposals focus on improving access to health insur-ance. But while play-or-pay would improve access to health insur-ance for some workers with low incomes or poor health status, itcould reduce the incomes and employment opportunities of manyother low-income people. Competitive firms would probably have topass along the costs of health insurance to their workers in theform of lower wages. Thus, mandating health insurance throughthe workplace could lead to lower wages among currently unin-sured employees and to increased unemployment among employeeswhose wages are at or near the minimum.To the extent that employers chooee to \"play\" rather than\"pay,\" play-or-pay reform would retain some of the competitiveaspects of the current health care market. Firms offering benefitssimilar to those offered in the public plan, however, would be ableto switch to the \"pay\" option if the cost of their health insurancepremiums is greater than the payroll tax. If the tax is set too low,everyone will eventually be enrolled in a single public plan. If thetax is too high, sm All employers will be forced to buy coatly insur-ance, which will 'Acrease the plan's potential to lead to layoffs.Play-or-pay alone does not directly address the problem of con-trolling health care expenditures. The effect of play-or-pay on costswould depend greatly on the structure of the public health insur-ance program, because a play-or-pay system would greatly increaseparticipation in this program. Medicaid includes only limited provi-sions to reduce moral hazard. It has only recently launched man- 161 ) aged care initiatives and, because it covers a population in poverty,currently incorporates few patient payment requirements. Thepublic program in a play-or-pay system would need to include morepatient payment requirements and managed care initiatives if coatsare to be contained. Otherwise, play-or-pay could lead to increasedoverconsumption of medical resources, driving up health care costs.Play-or-pay would provide health insurance to those with poorhealth conditions who may not be able to afford insurance in thecurrent market. These people, however, are likely to be insuredthrough the public program. Firms that hire workers with serioushealth conditions can avoid paying high insurance premiums byswitching to the public plan. As a consequence, the cost of provid-ing care in the public plan is likely to rise, and payroll tax ratesmay have to be raised to offset this*crease. As the cost of healthcare rises, firms that are required to provide health insurance maybegin laying off workers, especially low-skilled workers (as de-scribed above).NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROPOSALSProposals for national health insurance envision replacing theprivate health insurance market with a single national health in-surer. This national health insurer would be funded through taxesand care would be either free (as in Canada) or provided at a lowcost-sharing level. National health insurance would provide Ameri-cans, regardless of income or health status, with access to a cen-trally determined set of health care services, at no direct cost tothe insured. Because everyone would have exactly the same healthinsurance, national health insurance avoids the problems of riskselection and adverse selection.Although national health insurance would ensure access tohealth insurance for everyone, it provides few incentives for con-sumers to limit their use of services and could lead to an explosionin cost unless other substantial reforms were undertaken. Nationalhealth insurance greatly reduces existing incentives for consumersto limit their use of care. In most proposals, the cost of health careis shared among all taxpayers with few deductibles and copay-ments. The Canadian experience and other evidence suggest thatsubstantial increases in utilization would be likely to accompanysuch reductions in deductibles and copayments.Some proposals for national health insurance envision savingmoney by reducing administrative costs, but since reductions in ad-ministrative costs are likely to be accompanied by increased over-consumption of services, net health care costs may not decrease.National health insurance plans can control costs mainly by con-trolling the quantity and quality of health care supplied, oftenthrough price or budget controls (discussed below). An alternative 11;. 0162 71 way to control costs would be to fund only selected services, amethod that has been proposed for the State of Oregon's medicaidprogram (Box 4-7).Controls on supply and reductions in administrative coats areeasiest to achieve in national health insurance programs that donot allow people to opt out by purchasing private health insurance.Adding any degree of choice to a national health insurance pro-gramby allowing people to purchase alternative insurance, for in-stancemay reduce the cost savings achieved through supply con-trols and would be likely to increase administrative costs.cAlialt.40r***0 Services Commission undattoolt an extensiveprocess that included research andsnalysis at well es consulta-ions with the public. Initially the consmipsion identified 709\"Condition-treatesent\" pairs, such as. appendicitis-appendecto-my. Next, the Commission claesified each pair into 1 of 17 cate-gories according -to the outoonses that could be expected fromthe treatment, such as \"prevents death with fun recovery,\"and ranked the pairs within each of the categories acconling totheir impact on the quality of life. Finally, the commission sub-mitted the ranked list of 709 pairs to the State legislature.The legislature appropriated funds to cover services 1-587 onthe list. These condition-treatment pairs would be included inthe baeic medical plan. Those condition-treatment pairs ranked588-709 would not be covered for those ineured by medicaid inOregon.Because medicaid I. funded jointly by the Federal Govern-ment and the States, Oregon had to apply for a waiver fromthe Federal Government in order to implement this plan. Thiswaiver was denied to the current version of the Oregon plan inAugust because of concerns that it violated the rights of thedisabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 163 BEST COPY AVAILABLEg 72 RATE SETTINGSome play-or-pay and national health insurance proposals incor-porate provisions for rate setting. Rate setting, currently in use forhospital billing in some States, means that a governmental agencysets a single schedule of health care prices on which all payments,whether private or public, are based. In practice, increases in utili-zation often accompany such restrictions on prices in the healthcare market, limiting their effectiveness as a method of cost con-trol. Because of the difficulty of measuring prices and quantities ofhealth care, providers of health care services can easily change thequantity of health care services they report to accommodate lowerprices. For example, an increase in the number of diagnostic testsprovided to a patient will appear to be an increase in the per-visitprice if all the tests are provided during one visit. This same in-crease will appear as an increase in quantity, rather than as aprice hike, if the tests are spread over multiple visits.Problems in measuring units of health care services make theenforcement of price controls in this sector troublesome. The Cana-dian experience suggests that the implementation of price controlsin a fee-for-service physician payment system is likely to be accom-panied by large increases in office visits. For example, physicianscould require their patients to make office visits to get the resultsof tests, rather than simply conveying this information over thephone or by mail. Doctors could refuse to do more than one proce-dure per visit, requiring the patient to come back again for asecond procedure, in order to get a second fee from the govern-ment. Studies of the Canadian system suggest that very substattialamounts of patient time are wasted through unnecessary trips tothe doctor.Experience from other industries suggests that if price controlscould be enforced, they would likely lead to shortages of desiredservices. Initially, rates may be set to reflect the availability andneed for services. But over time, the bureaucratic process of settingrates may mean that changes in the provision of, or demand for,services are not captured by new rates. When conditions change,the old rates are likely to cause shortages.GLOBAL BUDGETSA frequently recommended proposal for controlling expendituresin the health care system has been global budgets that cover allhealth costs. Global budgets would fix the sums health care provid-ers throughout the U.S. economy can spend.It would be very difficult to implement global budgets in thefragmented health care sector that now exists. For example, aglobal budget would have to account for out-of-pocket paymentsmade by consumers, fee-for-service payments made by conventional 164 73 insurers, per capita payments made by HMOs, and the provision ofuncompensated care in emergency rooms. They would have to allo-cate funding across regions, States, and cities, although currentlyspending varies considerably in different localities. Most globalbudget plans would begin by implementing price controlsfor ex-ample, setting payment levels for diagnosis-related groups and forHMOsbut as noted above, such controls are likely to lead to in-creases in utilization.Global budgets could also be applied to individual hospitals, inde-pendent of the amount of service provided. Such budgets wouldcreate incentives to reduce the services within a hospital and couldlead to delays in admitting patients, or reductions in the use of ef-fective but costly medical technologies.Under global budgets there would be few incentives for providersto compete by developing better ways to deliver care. Improve-ments in health care delivery would be made primarily by govern-ment mandate. The government would take a very active rcle indeciding how much health care would be provided, stipulating thenumber of practicing physicians, the number of hospital beds, andthe availability of new medical technologies and treatments.Such government-determined supply-side controls could also leadto inappropriate decisions at the level of the individual provider.For example, hospitals are likely to find it easier to stay withintheir annual budgets if they keep their hospital beds filled with pa-tients who have already recovered, rather than admitting sickerpatients. Global budgets for physicians may lead doctors to restricttheir hours and increase their vacation days rather than providingcost-effective care. Efficient physicians can be penalized if globalbudgets lead to across-the-board cutbacks in spending on care.POLITICS AND HEALTH CAREMost proposals for reform of the health care market envision alarger governmental role. For example, under the Administration'sproposal, the Federal Government would define a basic benefitplan that could be purchased by recipients of the tax credit or de-duction (although they could choose other plans). Under the man-aged competition proposal, government boards would define ac-countable health partnerships and the basic benefits people couldpurchase and still remain eligible for the tax subsidy. Such govern-ment-determined allocation decisions are likely to become politi-cized. Decisions about which services to cover and payments tomake may be affected by the political influence of provider groupsrather than by appropriate medical and economic considerations.Governments already play an enormous role in the U.S. healthcare industry as regulators, purchasers, and employers. Federal.State, and local governments regulate virtually every aspect of the 165 74 industry, from the supply of insurance to the practice of medicineto the sale of pharmaceuticals. In 1990 including the value ofhealth-related tax subsidies, governments paid for about the sameshare of the output in this industry as in the aerospace industry.The three levels of government together employed more than twiceas many health and hospital workers as postal workers.Using government bureaucracies rather than markets to deter-mine industry outcomes is usually wasteful and inefficient. The or-dinary problems of regulation are magnified in the health care con-text for two reasons. First, setting quantities is difficult because ofthe enormous variation in people's need for and attitude towardmedical care, a product that is constantly changing. Second, regula-tors have to rely on producer groups (including insurers, doctors,and hospital employees) and some consumer groups for informationand support, and these groups share a proclivity to expand publicand private expenditures at the expense of the general public.SUMMARYThe Administration's proposal for health care market reformwould expand the insurance coverage available to low-incomeand middle-income Americans.The use of health risk adjuSters in the Administration plancan reduce differences in the cost of health insurance betweenpeople in good health and people in poor health Unlike com-munity rating plans, health risk adjusters limit the incentivefor insurers to exclude those in poor health.Managed competition proposals would encourage competitionamong health insurers providing a basic benefit package. Man-aged competition requires that the government play a substan-tial role in the private health insurance market, monitoring in-surers and defining the benefits that most Americans would re-ceive.Play-or-pay proposals focus on improving access to insuranceby mandating that employers provide basic health insurance orpay a tax to cover enrollment in a public plan. These proposalsdo not directly address the problem of rising costs and maycause firms to lay off low-wage workers.National health insurance proposals would provide insurancefor all Americans through a single national insurer. Withoutsubstantial restraints on the quality and quantity of care pro-vided, national health insurance could lead to a cost explosion.Attempts to regulate the price of health care are often ineffec-tive in reducing expenditures because of offsetting increases inutilization. If rate regulation succeeds in holding down prices,it may lead to reductions in the quality of health care and towaiting lines for services. 166 75 CONCLUSIONThe U.S. health care market provides a very high standard of health care to most Americans. The cost of care in this market has, however, been growing very rapidly, and many Americans have in- adequate health insurance coverage. Careful analysis of thismarket indicates that it is subject to many of the same economic forces as other sectors and establishes certain guiding principlesthat must be heeded if reform is to be successful.As government and employer-provided health insurance pro- grams have expanded, Americans have been paying for less of theirhealth care out of their own pockets. Because people with healthinsurance do not face the full cost of their health care decisions, they overconsume health care services. Over time, the quantity and quality of services consumed by Americans have been increasingrapidly.Because of the high cost of health care, many of the poor and chronically ill find that they cannot afford health insurance. Theseuninsured individuals often resort to hospital emergency rooms, re- sulting in a very costly and inefficient use of resources. Most Amer- icans believe poor and unhealthy people should not have to choose between paying high premiums for health insurance or going with- out any insurance at all.Because of the complexity of the health care industry, no reform plan can address all features of the system perfectly. Yet some ap- proaches are better than others, because they deal more directly with the sources of rising expenditures and declining insurance coverage. Successful reforms must create incentives for consumers, insurers, and providers to cut costs and share the cost of care for the chronically ill.Experience in other countries and in the United States suggests that health care costs cannot be controlled, even with waiting lines and limits on the use of medical treatments, unless the consump- tion of services is limited through incentives, such as deductibles and copayments, that encourage people to regulate the way they use health care services. Alternatively, insurers can monitor the use of care through coordinated care arrangements. Failure to con- trol the overconsumption of services that results from insurance will make it impossible to control health care costs. Even if overall costs can be controlled, expenditures for health care are likely to remain higher for those in poor health than forhealthy people. One approach to this problem, community rating, creates a single premium level for everyone. In a competitive insur- ance market, however, community rating conflicts with the incen- tives of both insurers and healthy people. Insurers will try to dis- courage unhealthy people from enrolling in their insurance plans, 167 76 leaving thechronicallyillwithout insurance.Alternatively,healthy people will opt out of the insurance market or select planswith high deductibles and copayments, so that the premiums paidby those remaining in more comprehensive plans are very high.Another response to differences in health risk is the use of healthrisk adjusters, which provide insurers with incentives to insurethose in poor health.Because providers know more about medical treatment than dopatients, a successful reform must give providers financial incen-tives to recommend only those treatments whose benefits exceedtheir costs. Financing arrangements that pay doctors and hospitalsa fixed amount regardless of how many services they providereduce the incentive for providers to recommend unnecessary serv-ices. An important additional step toward achieving this goal is tomake it easier for patients to evaluate health care providers. In-formed patients will be better able to identify providers that offerhigh-quality health care at a reasonable price.Reforms that give consumers, insurers, and providers appropri-ate incentives are likely to be the most effective way of controllingcosts, improving access to insurance, and giving Americans thequality of health care that they want. Without these incentives,health care costs will continue to climb and the number of unin-sured will only grow larger. t.`l 68 41 77 192Special Message to the Congress Recommending aComprehensive Health Program. November 19, 1945To the Congress of the United States:In my message to the Congress of September 6, 1945, there w'reenumerated in a proposed Economic Bill of Rights certain rights whichought to be assured to every American citizen.One of thcm was: \"The right to adequate medical care and theopportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.\" Another was the\"right to adequate protection from the economic fears of ... sick-ness. ...\"Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of opportunityto achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not now have protectionor security against the cconomic effects of sickness. The timc has ar-rived for action to help them attain that opportunity and that protcction.The people of the United Statcs received a shock whcn the medicalexaminations conducted by the Selective Service Systcm revealed thcwidespread physical and mental incapacity among thc young people ofour nation. Wc bad had prior warnings from eminent medical authori-ties and from investigating committees. The statistics of thc last warhad shown the same condition. But the Selective Service Systcm hasbrought it forcibly to our attention recentlyin tcrms which all of uscan understand.As of April r, 1945, nearly 5,000,000 male registrants between the agesof iS and 37 had been examined and classified as unfit for militaryservice.The number of those rejected for military service was about30 percent of all those examined. Thc percentage of rejection waslower in the younger agc groups, and higher in the higher age groups,reaching as high as 49 percent for registrants between thc ages of 34and 37.In addition, aftcr actual induction, about a million and a half mcnhad to be discharged from the Army anc: Navy for physical or mentaldisability, exclusive of wounds; and an equal number had to be treatedin the Armed Forccs for diseases or defects which existed beforeinduction.Among the young womcn who applied for admission to the Womcn'sArmy Corps there was similar disability. Over one-third of thoseexamined were rejected for physical or mental reasons.These men and women who were rejected for military service arcnot necessarily incapable of civilian work. It is plain, however, thatthey have illnesses and defects that handicap them, reduce their work-ing capacity, or shortcn their lives.It is not so important to search the past in order to fix the blame forReproduced from Special message to the Congressrecommending a Comprehensive Health Program.In the Public papers of the Presidents of theUnited States: Harry S. Truman, G.P.O., 1961.p. 476-491.\\ 78 Harry S. Truman, 1945 Nov. 59[isa]these conditions. It is more important to resolve now that no Americanchild shall come to adult lifc with diseases or defects which can be pre-vented or corrected at an early age.Medicine has made great strides in this generationespecially dur-ing the last four years. We owe much to the skill and devotionof the medical profession.In spite of great scientific progress, how-ever, each year we lose many more persons from preventable andpremature deaths than we lost in battle or from war injuries duringthe entire war.Wc are proud of past reductions in our death rat's. But these re-ductions have come principally from public health and other com-munity services. We have been less effective in making available toall of our people the benefits of medical progrcss in the carc andtreatment of individuals.In the past, thc benefits of modern medical science have not beenenjoyed by our citizens with any degree of equality. Nor are theytoday. Nor will they be in the futureunless government is boldenough to do something about it.People with low or moderate incomes do not get the same medicalattention as thosc with high incomes. The poor have more sickness,but they get less medical care. People who live in rural arcas do notgct thc same amount or quality of medical attention as thoce who livein our cities.Our new Economic Bill of Rights should mean health security forall, regardless of residence, station, or raceeverywhere in thc UnitedStates.Wc should resolve now that thc health of this Nation is a nationalconccrn; that financial barriers in the way of attaining health shall beremoved; that the health of all its citizens deserves the help of all theNation.There are fivc basic problems which we must attack vigorously if wcwould rcach the health objectives of our Economic Bill of Rights.s. The first has to do with the number and distribution of doctorsand hospitals. Onc of the most important requirements for adequatehealth service is professional personneldoctors, dcntists, public health 0 Lk477 79 and hospital administrators, nurscs and other experts.The United States has been fortunate with respect to physicians. Inproportion to population it has more than any large country in theworld, and they are well trained for their calling. It is not enough,however, that we have thcm in sufficient numbers. They should bclocated where their services arc needed. In this respect wc arc not scifortunatc.The distribution of physicians in the United States has been grosslyuneven and unsatisfactory.Some communities have had enough oreven too many; too fcw. Year by ycar thc number inour rural areas has been diminishing. Indeed, in 1940, there were 3[countics in the United Statcs, each with morc than a thousand inhabit-ants, in which there was not a single practicing physician. The situa-tion with respect to dentists was even worse.Onc important reason for this disparity is that in some communitiesthere arc no adequate facilities for the practice of medicine. Anotherreasonclosely allied with thc firstis that thc earning capacity of thcpeople in somc communities makes it difficult if not impossible fordoctors who practice thcrc to makc a living.The demobilization of Go,000 doctors, and of thc tcns of thousands ofother professional personnel in thc Armed Forces is now proceedingon a large scale.Unfortunately, unless wc act rapidly, wc may expectto see them concentrate in the places with greater financial resourcesand avoid other places, making the inequalities even greater than beforethe war.Demobilized doctors cannot be assigned. They must be attracted. Inordcr to bc attracted, thcy must bc able to scc ahcad of thcm profes-sional opportunities and economic assurances.Inequalities in the distribution of medical personnel arc matched byinequalities in hospitals and othcr health facilities. Moreover, there arcjust too fcw hospitals, clinics and health centers to take proper care ofthc people of thc United States.About 1,200 counties, 40 percent of thc total in the country, with somcr5,000,000 people, have either no local hospital, or none that mccts eventhe minimum standards of national professional associations. so Thc deficiencies are especially severe in rural and scmirural areas andin those cities where changes in population have placed great strainson community facilities.I want to emphasize, however, that thc basic problem in this fieldcannot be solved merely by building facilities. They have to be staffed;and the communities have to be able to pay for the services. Other-wise thc new facilities will be little used.2. Thc second basic problem is thc need for development of publichealth services and maternal and child carc. The Congress can bejustifiably proud of its share in making recent accomplishments possi-ble.Public health and maternal and child health programs alreadyhave made important contributions to national health. But large ne9elsremain.Great areas of our country arc still without these servrces.This is especially truc among our rural areas; but it is truc also in fartoo many urban communitics.Although local public health departments arc now maintained bysome 113,000 countics and other local units, many of these have onlyskeleton organizations, and approximately 40,000,000 citizens of theUnited States still live in communities lacking full-time local publichealth service. At the recent rate of progress in developing such serv-ice, it would take morc than a hundred years to cover thc whole Nation.If wc agrcc that thc national health must be improved, our citics,towns and farming communities must be made healthful places inwhich to live through provision of safe water systems, sewage disposalplants and sanitary facilities. Our streams and rivers must be safe-guarded against pollution. In addition to building a sanitary environ-ment for ourselves and for our children, we must provide thosc serviceswhich prevent disease and promote health.Services for expectant mothcrs and for infants, care of crippled orotherwise physically handicapped children and inoculation for the pre-vention of communicable discascs ate accepted public health functions.So too are many kinds of personal services such as thc diagnosis andtreatment of widespread infections like tuberculosis and venereal dis-ease. A large part of the population today lacks many or all of theseservices. 0 81 [192]Nov. 19Public Papers of the PresidentsOur success in thc traditional public health sphere is made plain bythe conquest over many communicable diseases. Typhoid fever, small-pox, and diphtheriadiseases for which thcrc are effective controlshave become comparatively rare. We must make the same gains inreducing our maternal and infant mortality, in controlling tubercu-losis, venereal disease, malaria, and other major threats to life andhealth. We arc only beginning to realize our potentialities in achiev-ing physical well-being for all our people.3. The third basic problem concerns medis:al research and profes-sional education.Wc have long recognized that wc cannot bc content with what isalready known about health or disease. We must learn and under-stand more about health and how to prevent and cure disease.Researchwell directed and continuously supportedcan do muchto develop ways to reduce those diseases of body and mind which nowcause most sickness, disability, and premature deathdiseases of theheart, kidneys and arteries, rheumatism, cancer, diseases of childbirth,infancy and childhood, respiratory diseases and tuberculosis. And re-search can do much toward teaching us how to keep well and how toprolong healthy human lifc.Cancer is among the leading causes of death. It is responsible forover tGo,000 recorded deaths a year, and should receive special atten-tion. Though we already have the National Canccr Institute of thePublic Health Service, wc need still morc coordinated research on thccause, prevention and curc of this disease. We need more financialsupport for research and to establish special clinics and hospitals fordiagnosis anti treatment of thc disease especially in its early stages. Wenccd to train more physicians for the highly specialized services soessential for effective control of cancer.There is also special need for research on mental diseases and ab-normalities. We have done pitifully little about mental illnesses. Ac-curate statistics arc lacking, but there is no doubt that thcrc are at leasttwo million persons in the United States who arc mentally ill, and thatas many as ten million will probably nccd hospitalization for mentalillness for some period in thc course of their lifetime. A great many of480 82 these persons would be helped by proper care. Mental cascs occupymore than one-half of thc hospital beds, at a cost of about 500 milliondollars per yearpractically all of it coming out of taxpayers' money.Each year there arc 1-25,oco new mental cases admitted to institutions.We need more mental-disease hospitalc more out-patient clinics. Weneed for early diagnosis, and opecially we nt.ed muchmore research to learn how to prevent mental breakdown. Also, wcmust have many more trained and qualified doctors in this field.It is clear that wc have not done enough in peace-time for medicalresearch and education in view of our enormous resources and ournational interest in health progress. The money invested in researchpays enormous dividends.If any one doubts this, let him think ofpenicillin, plasma, DDT powdcr, and ncw rehabilitation techniques.4. Thc fourth problem has to do with the high cost of individualmedical care. The principal reason why people do not receive thc carethey need is that they cannot afford to pay for it on an individual basisat the time they need it. This is true not only for needy persons. It isalso frue for a large proportion of normally self-supporting persons.In the aggregate, all health servicesIrons public health agencies,physicians, hospitals, dentists, nurses and laboratoriesabsorb only about4 percent of the nationalincome. We can afford to spend more forhealth.But four percent is only an average. It is cold comfort in individualcases.Individual fatuities pay their individual costs, and not averagecosts. They may be hit bysickness that calls for many timcs thc aver-age costin extreme cases for more than their annual income. Whenthis happens they may come face to face with economic disaster. Manyfamilies, fearful of expense, delay calling the doctor long beyond thetime when medical care would do thc most good.For some persons with very low income or no income at all wc nowusc taxpayers' money inthe form of free services, free clinics, and pub-lic hospitals. Tax-supported, free medical care for needy persons, how-ever, is insufficient in mostof our cities and in nearly all of our ruralareas. This deficiency cannot be met by private charity or the kindnessof Hfividual physicians.481 F.: 6BEST COPYAVMLABLE 83 Each of us knows doctors who work through endless days and nights,never expecting to be paid for their services because many of their pa-tients are unable to pay. Often the physician spends not only his timeand effort, but even part of the fccs he has collected from patients ableto pay, in order to buy medical supplies for those who cannot affordthem.I am sure that there arc thousands of such physicians through-out our country. Thcy cannot, and should not, be expected to carryso heavy a load.5. The fifth problem has to do with loss of earnings when sicknessstrikes.Sickness not only brings doctor bills; it also cuts off income.On an average day, there arc about 7 million persons so disabled bysickness or injury that they cannot go about thcir usual tasks. Of these,about 31/4 millions are persons who, if they were not disabled, would beworking or seeking employment. More than one-half of these disabledworkers have already been disabled for six months; many of them willcontinue to be disabled for years, and some for the remainder of theirlives.Every year, four or five hundred million working days arc lost fromproductive employment because of illness and accident among thoseworking or looking for workabout forty times the number of dayslost because of strikes on the average during the ten years before thewar. About nine-tenths of this enormous loss is due to illness and acci-dent that is not directly connected with employment, and is thereforenot covered by workmen's compensation laws. These then arc the five important probletns which must be solved,if we hope to attain our objective of adequate medical care, good health,anti protection frown the economic fears of sickness anti disability.To meet these problems, I recommend that the Congress adopt acomprehensive and modern health program for thc Nation, consistingof five major partscach of which contributes to all the others. FIRST: CONSTRUCTION OF HOSPITALS AND RELATED FACILITIESThc Federal Government should provide financial and other assist-ance for thc construction of needed hospitals, health centers and other482 84 Harry S. Truman, 1945 Nov. 19[592]medical, health, and rehabilitation facilities. With the help of Federalfunds, it should bc possible to meet deficiencies in hospital and healthfacilities so that modern servicesfor both prevention and curecan bcaccessible to all thc people.Federal financial aid should be availablenot only to build new facilities where needed, but alto to enlarge ormodernize those we now have.In carrying out this program, there should be a clear division ofresponsibilities between the States and the Federal Government. ThcStates, localities and the Federal Government should share in the finan-cial responsibilities. The Federal Government should not construct oroperate these hospitals.It should, however, lay down minimum na-tional standards for construction and operation, and should make surethat Federal funds are allocated to those areas and projects where Fed-eral aid is needed most.In approving state plans and individual proj-ects, and in fixing the national staildards, the Federal agency shouldhave the help of a strktly advisory body that includes both public andirofessional members.Adequate emphasis should be given to facilities that arc particularlyuseful for prevention of diseasesmental as well as physicaland tothe coordination of various kinds of facilities. It should be possible togo a long way toward knitting together facilities for pre% elision ssithfacilities for cure, the large hospitals of medical centers with the smallerinstitutions of surrounding areas, the facilities for thc civilian popula-tion with the facilities for veteran,.The general policy of Foleral State pattnership sshich ha, done somuch to provide the magnitisent highways of the United States Lan beadapted to the construction of hospitals in the communities which needthem. SI.cOND:ot: 1.1.10 lcAt.5MATIAND CHILD Ill All II for poblic he..1:11 and related thc tcn ycars beforethe and bccn extended in some arcas during thc war. Theyhave already made important contributions to national health, but theyhave not yct reached a large proportion of our rural areas, and, in manycities, they arc only partially developed.No arca in the Nation should continue to be without the services ofa full-time health officer and other essential personnel. No area shouldbe without essential public health services or sanitation facilities. Noarca should bc without community health services such as maternal andchild health care.Hospitals, clinics and health centers must bc built to mcct the needs of the total population, andmust make adequate provision for the safebirth of every baby, and for the health protection of infants and children.Present laws relating to general public health, and to maternal andchild lwalth, have built a solid foundation of Federal cooperation with the States in administering community health services.The emer-gency maternity and infant care progrdm for the wives and infants ofservicemena great wartime service authorized by the Congresshas materially increased the experience of every State health agency, andhas provided much-needed care. So too have other wartime programssuch as venereal disease control, industrial hygiene, malaria control, tuberculosiscontroland other servicesofferedin war essentialcommunities.The Federal Government should cooperate by more generous grantsto the States than are provided under present lAws for public health services and for maternal and child health care. Thc program shouldcontinue to be partly financed by thc States themselves, and should be administered by the States.Federal grants should be in proportion to State and local expenditures, and should also vary in accordance withthe financial ability of thc respective Stares.Thc health of American children, like their education, should berecognized as a definite public responsibility.In the conquest of many diseases prevention is even morc important than cure. A well-rounded national health program should, therefore,include systematic and wide-spread health and physical education and BEST COPY AVAILABLE Ca 86 examinations, beginning with thc youngest children and extendinginto community organizations. Medical and dental examinations ofschool chihlrcn arc now inadequate. A preventive health program, tobe successful, must discover dcfects as early as possible. We should,therefore, see to it that our health programs are pushed most vigorouslywith tbc youngest scction of the population.Of course, Federal aid for community health servicesfor generalpublic health and for mothers nd childrenshould complement andnot duplicate prepaid medical services for individuals, proposed by thcfourth recommendation of this message. THIRD: NIVDICAL IDCCATION AND RESEARCHThc Federal Government should undertake a broad program tostrengthen professional education in medical and related fields, and toencourage and support medical research.Professional education should be strengthened where necessarythrough Federal grants-in-aid to public and to non-profit private insti-tutions.Medical research, also, should be encouraged and supportedin the Federal agencies and by grants-in-aid to public and non-profitprivate agencies.In my message to the Congress of September 6, 1945, I made variousrecommendations for a general Federal research program. Medicalresearchdealing with thc broad fields of physical and mental ill-nesccsshould bc made effective in part through that general programand in part through specific provisions within thc scope of a nationalhealth program.Federal aid to promote and support research in medicine, publichealth and allied fields is an essential part of a general research programto bc administered by a central Federal research agency. Federal aidfor medical research and education is also an essential part of any na-tional health program, if it is to meet its responsibilities for high grademedical services and for cont;nuing progress. Coordination of the twoprograms is obviously necessary to assure efficient use of Federal funds.Legislation covering medical research in a national health programshould provide for such coordination. FOURTH: PREPAYMENT OF MEDICAL COSTSEveryone should have ready access to all necessary medical, hospitaland related services.I recommend solving thc basic problem by distributing thc coststhrough expansion of our existing compulsory social insurance systcm.This is not socialized medicine.Everyone who carries firc insurance knows how thc law of averagesis made to work so as to sprcad the risk, and to benefit thc insurcd whoactually suffers thc loss.If instead of the costs of sickness being paidonly by those who get sick, all the peoplesick and wellwere re-quired to pay premiums into an insurance fund, the pool of funds thuscreated would enable all who do fall sick to bc adequately served with-out overburdening anyone. That is the principle upon which all formsof insurance arc based.During the past fifteen years, hospital insurance plans have taughtmany Americans this magic of averages. Voluntary heahh insuranceplans have been expanding during recent years; but their rate of growthdoes not justify the belief that they will meet more than a fraction ofour people's needs. Only about 3% or 4% of our population now haveinsurance providing comprehensive medical care.A system of required prepayment would not only spread the costs ofmedical care, it would also prevent much scrious disease. Since medicalbills would be paid by thc insurance fund, doctors would more oftenbe consulted when thc first signs of disease occur instead of when thedisease has become scrious. Modern hospital, specialist and laboratoryservices, as needed, would also become available to all, and would im-prove thc quality and adequacy of care. Prepayment of medical carewould go a long way toward furnishing insurance against disease itself,as well as against medical bills.Such a systcm of prepayment should cover medical, hospital, nurs-ing and laboratory services.It should also cover dental careas fullyand for as many of thc population as thc available professional person-nel and the financial resources of the system permit.The ability of our people to pay for adequate medical carc will be 88 increased if, while they arc well, they pay regularly into a commonhealth fund, instcad of paying sporadically and unevenly when thcyarc sick. This health fund should be built up nationally, in order toestablish the broadest and most stable basis for spreading thc costs ofillness, and to assurc adequate financial support for doctors and hos-pitals everywhere. If wc were to rely on state-by-state action only, manyyears would elapse before wc had any general coverage. Meanwhilehealth service would continue to be grossly uneven, and disease wouldcontinue to cross state boundary lines.Medical services arc personal. Therefore the nation-wide systcmmust be highly decentralized in administration. The local adminis-trfilVe unit must be the keystone of the system so as to provide for localservices and adaptation to local needs and conditions. Locally as wellas nationally, policy and administration should be guided by advisorycommittees in which the public and thc medical professions arcrepresented.Subject to national standards, mcthods and ratcs of paying doctorsand hospitals should be adjusted locally. All such rates for doctorsshould be adequate, and should be appropriately adjusted upward forthose who arc qualified specialists.People should remain free to choosc their own physicians and hos-pitals. The removal of financial barriers between patient and doctorwould enlarge the present freedom of choice. The legal requirementon thc population to contribute involves no compulsion over thc doctor'sfreedom to decide what services his paticnt needs. People will remainfree to obtain and pay for medical service outsidc of the health insur-ance systcm if they desire, even though thcy arc members of thc system;just as they arc frcc to send their children to private instead of to publicschools, although they must pay taxes for public schools.Likewise physicians should remain free to accept or reject patients.They must be allowed to decide for themselves whether they wish toparticipate in the health insurancc system full time, part timc, or notat all. A physician may have somc paticnts who arc in the system andsomc who arc not.Physicians must be permitted to be representedthrough organizations of thcir own choosing, and to decide whether to 589 carry on in individual practice or to join with other doctors in grouppractice in hospitals or in clinics.Our voluntary hospitals and our city, county and statc general hos-pitals, in the same way, must be free to participate in the system to what-ever extent thcy wish. In any case they must continuc to retain theiradministrative independence.Voluntary organizations which provide health services that mcct rea-sonable standards of quality should be entitled to furnish services undcrthc insurance system and to be reimbursed for thcm. Voluntary co-operative organizations concerned with paying doctors, hospitals orothers for health services, but not providing services directly, should bcentitled to participate if thcy can contributc to the efficiency and econ-omy of the system.None of this is really ncw. Thc American people arc thc most in-surance-minded people in the world. Th...y will not be frightened offfrom health insurance because sonic people have misnamed it \"socializedmedicine\".I repeatwhat I am recommending is not socialized medicine.Socialized medicine means that all doctors work as employees ofgovernment. The American people want no such systcm. No suchsystem is here proposed.Under the plan I suggest, our people would continue to get medicaland hospital services just as they do nowon the basis of their ownvoluntary decisions and choices. Our doctors and hospitals would con-tinue to deal with disease with the same professional freedom as now.There would, however, be this all-important difference: whether or notpatients gct thc services they need would not depend on how much theycan afford to pay at the timc.I am in favor of the broadest possible coverage for this insurancesystem.I believe that all persons who work for a living and theirdependents should be covered under such an insurance pin. Thiswould include wage and salary earners, thosc in business for them-selves, professional persons, farmers, agricultural labor, domestic em-ployees, government, employees and employees of non-profit institutionsand their families. e-..5) 90 In addition, needy persons and other groups should be coveredthrough appropriate premiums paid for them by public agencies.In-creased Federal funds should also be made available by the Congressunder thc public assistance programs to reimburse the States for part ofsuch premiums, as well as for direct expenditures made by the Statesin paying for medical services provided by doctors, hospitals and otheragencies to needy persons.Premiums for present social insurance benefits arc calculated on thefirst $3,000 of earnings in a year. It might be well to have all suchpremiums, including those for health, calculated on a somewhat higheramount such as $3,600.A broad program of prepayment for medical care would need totalamounts approximately equal to 4% of such earnings. Thc people ofthe United States have been spending, on the average, nearly this per-centage of their incomes for sickness care. How much of the total fundshould come from the insurance premiums and how much from generalrevenues is a matter for the Congress to decide.The plan which I have suggested would be sufficient to pay mostdoctors more than die best they have received in peacetime years. Thepayments of the doctors bills would be guaranteed, and the doctorswould be sparcd the annoyance and uncertainty of collecting fees fromindividual patients. Thc same assurance would apply to hospitals,dentists and nurses for the services they render.Federal aid in the construction of hospitals will be futile unless thereis current purchasing power so that people can use these hospitals.Doctors cannot be drawn to sections which nccd them without someassurance that they can make a living. Only a nation-wide spreadingof sickness costs can supply such scctions vith sure and sufficient pur-chasing power to maintain enough physicians and hospitals.Wc arc a rich nation and can afford many things. But ill-healthwhich can be prevented or cured is one thing we cannot afford. FIFTH: PROTECTION AGAINST LOSS OF WAGES FROM SICKNESS AND DISABILITYWhat I have discussed heretofore has been a program for improvingand spreading the health services and facilities of the Nation, and pro- ,.) 91 viding an efficient and less burdensome system of paying for them.But no mattcr what we do, sickness will of coursc comc to many.Sickness brings with it loss of wages.Therefore, as a fifth clement of a comprehensive health program, theworkers of thc Nation artheir families should be protected againstloss of earnings because of illness. A comprehensive health programmust include the payment of benefits to replace at least part of theearnings that arc lost during thc period of sickness and longterm dis-ability.This protection can bc readily and conveniently providedthrough expansion of our present social insurance system, with appro-priate adjustment of premiums.Insurance against loss of wages from sickncss and disability dealswith cash benefits, rather than with services. It has to bc coordinatedwith the other cash benefits under existing social insurance systems.Such coordination should be effected when other social security meas-ures are reexamined.I shall bring this subject again to the attentionof the Congress in a separate message on social sccurity. I strongly urge that the Congress give careful consideration to thisprogram of health legislation now.Many millions of our veterans, accustomed in thc armed forces to thebest of medical and hospital care, will no longer be eligible for suchcare as a matter of right except for thcir service-connected disabilities.Thcy deserve continued adequate and comprehensive health service.And their dependents deserve it too.By preventing illness, by assuring acccss to needed community andpersonal health services, by promoting medical research, and by protect-ing our people against thc loss caused by sickncss, wc shall strengthenour national health, our national defense, and our cconomic produc-tivity. We shall increase the professional and economic opportunitiesof our physicians, dentists and nurscs. We shall incrcasc thc effective-ness of our hospitals and public health agencies. We shall bring newsccurity to our people.We need to do this especially at this time because of thc rcturn tocivilian life of many doctors, dentists and nurses, particularly youngmen and womcn.Appreciation of modern achievements in medicine and public healthhas created widespread dcmand that they be fully applied and univer-sally available. By meeting that demand we shall strengthen the Nationto meet futurc economic and social problems; and we shall make a mostimportant contribution toward freedom from want in our land.HARRY S. TRUMAN 64-300 0934 92 394 Remarks With President Truman at thc Signing inIndependence of the Medicare Bill. July 30, 1965PRESIDENT TRUMAN. Thank you very much.I am glad you like thc President. I like himtoo. He is one of the finest men I ever ranacross.Mr.President,Mrs. Johnson, distinguishedguests:You have done mc a great honor in corn-ing here today, and you have made mc avery, very happy man.This is an important hour for the Nation,for those of our citizens who have completedtheir tour of duty and have moved to thesidelines.nes.: arc thc days that we aretrying to celebrate for them. These peoplearc our prideful responsibility and they areentitled, among other benefits, to the bestmedical protection available.Not one of these, L., citizens, should everbe abandoned to the indignity of charity.Charity is indignity when you have to haveit.But we don't want these people to have-anything to do with charity and we don'twant them to have any idea of hopelessdespair.Mr. President, I am glad to have lived thislong and to witness today the signing of theMedicare bill which puts this Nation rightwherc it needs to be, to be right. Your in-tpired leadership and a responsive forward-looking Congress have made it historicallypossible for this day to comc about.Thank all of you most highly for cominghere.It is an honor I haven't had for, well,quite awhile, I'll say that to you, but hereit is:Ladies and gentlemen, the President of thcUnited States.THE Parstnex-r. and Mrs. Symington, Senator Long,Governor Hearnes, Senator Anderson andCongressman King of the Anderson-Kingteam, Congressman Mills and Senator Longof the Mills-Long team, our beloved VicePresident who worked in the vineyard manyyears to see this day come to pass, and all ofmy dear friends in the Congressboth Dem-ocrats and Republicans:The people of the United States loveaffd . voted for Harry Truman, not becausehe gave them hellbut because he gavethem hope.I believe today that all America sharesmy joy that he is present now when thehapc that he offered becomes a reality forReproduced from Remarks with President Trumanat the signing in Independence of the Medicare bill.recommending a Comprehensive Health Program.In the Public papers of the Presidents of theUnited States: Papers of the Presidentsmillions of our fellow citizens.I am so proud that this has come to passin thc Johnson administration. But it wasreally Harry Truman of Missouri whoplanted the seeds of compassion and dutywhich have today flowered into care for thesick, and serenity for the fearful.Many men can make many proposals.Many men can draft many laws. But fcwhave the piercing and humane eye which cansee beyond the words to the people thatthey touch.Fcw can see past the speechesand the political battles to the doctor overthere that is tending the infirm, and to thehospital that is receiving those in anguish,or feel in thcir hcart painful wrath at theinjustice which denies the miracle of heal-ing to the old and to the poor. And fewerstill have the courage to stake reputation,and position, and the effort of a lifetimeupon such a cause whcn there arc so fewthat share it.131:: it is just such mcn who illuminate thelife and the history of a nation. And so,President Harry Truman, itis in tributenot to you, but to the America that yourepresent, that we have come here to payour love and our respects to you today. Fora country can be known by the quality ofthe mcn it honors.By praising you, andby carrying forward your dreams, we reallyreaffirm the greatness of America.Itwas a generation ago that HarryTruman said, and I quote him: \"Millions ofour citizens do not now have a full measureof opportunity to achieve and to enjoy goodhealth.Millions do not now have protec-tion or security against the economic effectsof sickness. And the time has now arrivedfor action to help them attain that oppor-tunity and to help them get that protection.\"Well, today, Mr. President, and my fel-low Americans, we are taking such action- 81220 years later.And we are doing that underthe great leadership of men like JohnMcCormack, our Speaker; Carl Albert, ourmajority leader; our very able and belovedmajority leader of the Senate, Mike Mans-field; and distinguished Members of theWays and Means and Finance Committeesof the Housc and Senateof both parties,Democratic and Republican.Because the need for this action is plain;and it is so clear indeed that we marvel notsimply at the passage of this bill, but whatwe marvel at is that it took so many yearsto pass it.And I am so glad that AimeForand is here to see it finally passed andsignedone of the first authors.There arc more than 18 million Ameri-cans over the age of 65.Most of them havelow incomes.Most of them are threatenedby illness and medical expenses that theycannot afford.And through this new law, Mr. President,every citizen will be able, in his productiveyears when he is earning, to insurc himselfagainst the ravages of illness in his old age.This insurance will help pay for care inhospitals, in skilled nursing homes, or inthe home. And under a separate plan itwill help meet the fees of the doctors.Now here is how the plan will affect you.During your working years, the people ofAmericayouwill contribute through thesocial sccurity program a small amount eachpayday for hospital insurance protection.For example, the average worker in 1966will cortribute about 151.50 per month. Theemployer will contribute a similar amount.And this will provide the funds to pay up togo days of hospital care for each illness,plus diagnostic care, and up to too homehealth visits after you are 65. And begin-ning in 1967, you will also be covered forup to Too days of Care in a skilled nursing 94 Lyndon B. Johnson, 1965 July 30[394]home after a period of hospital care.And under a separate plan, when you arc65that the Congress originated itself, inits own good judgmentyou may be coveredfor medical and surgical fees whether you arcin or out of the hospital.You will pay $3per month after you arc 65 and your Govern-ment will contribute an equal amount.The benefits under thc law arc as variedand broad as the marvelous modern medi-cine itself.If it has a fcw defectssuch asthc method of payment of certain special-iststhenI am confident thosc can bequickly remedied and I hope they will be.No longer will older Americans be dcnicdthe healing miracle of modern mcdicinc.No longer will illness crush and destroy thcsavings that they have so carefully put awayover a lifetime so that they might enjoydignity in their later years. No longer willyoung families scc thcir own incomes, andtheir own hopes, eaten away simply becausethey are carrying out their deep moral obli-gations to their parents, and to their uncles,and their aunts.And no longer will this Nation refusethe hand of justice to those who have givena lifetime of service 2nd wisdom and labor tothc progress of this progressive country.And thisbill, Mr. President,isevenbroader than that.It will increase socialsccurity benefits for all of our older Ameri-cans.le will improve a wide range of healthand medical services for Americans of allages.In r935 when the man that both of usloved so much, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,signed the Social Security Act, he said itwas, and I quote him, \"a cornerstone in astructure which is being built but it is byno means complete.\"Well, perhaps no single act in the entireadministration of the beloved Franklin D.Roosevelt really did more to win him theillustrious place in history that he has as didthe laying of that cornerstone. And I am sohappy that his oldest son Jimmy could behere to share with us the joy that is ourstoday. And those who sharc this day willalso be remembered for making thc mostimportant addition to that structure, andyou are making it in this bill, the most im-portant addition that has been made in threedecades.I listory shapes men, but itis a necessaryfaith of leadership that men can help shapehistory.There are many who led us to thishistoric day.Not out of courtesy or defer.ence, but from the gratitude and remem-brance which is our country's debt, if I maybe pardoned for taking a moment, I wantto call a part of thc honor roll: it is the ablekadership in both Houses of the Congress.Congressman Ce Iler, Chairman of theJudiciary Committee, introduced the hos-pital insurance in 1952. Anne Forand fromRhode Island, then Congressman, intro-duced it in thc House. Senator Clinton An-dersonfrom New Mexico fought forMedicare through the years in thc Senate.Congressman Cecil King of California car-ried on thc battle in the House. The legis-lative genius of thc Chairman of the Waysand Means Committee, Congressman Wil-bur Mills. and the effective and able work ofSenator Russell Long, together transformedthis desire into victory.And those devoted public servants, formerSecretary, Senator Ribicoff; present Secre-tary, Tony Cekbrezze; Under Secretary Wil-bur Cohen; the Democratic whip of theHouse, Hale Boggs on the Ways and MeansCommittee; and really the White House'sbest legislator, Larry O'Brien, gave not justendless days and months and, yes, years ofpatiencebut they gave their heartstopassing this bill.Let us also remember those who sadly813 95 [394]July 30Public Papers of the Presidentscannot share this time for triumph. Forit is their triumph too.It is the victory ofgreat Members of Congress that are not withus, like John Dingell, Sr., and Robert Wag-ner, late a Member of the Senate, and JamesMurray of Montana.And there is also John Fitzgerald Ken-nedy, who fought in the Senate and took hiscase to the people, and never yielded in pur-suit, but was not spared to see the final con-course of the forces that he had helped toloose.But it all started really with the man fromIndependence. And so, as it is fitting thatwe should, we have come back here to hishome to complete what he began.President Harry Truman, as any Presi-dent must, made many decisions of greatmoment; although he always made themfrankly and with a courage and a claritythat few men have ever shared. Theimmense and the intricate questions offreedom and survival were caught up manytimes in the web of Harry Truman's judg-ment. And thisisin the tradition ofleadersh ip.But there is another tradition that weshare today.It calls upon us never to beindifferent toward despair.It commandsus never to turn away from helplessness.It directs us never to ignore or to spurnthose who suffer untended in a lan3 thatis bursting with abundance.I said to Senator Smashers, the whip ofthe Democrats in the Senate, who workedwith us in the Finance Committee on thislegislationI said, the highest traditions ofthe medical profession 2re really directed tothe ends that we are trying to serve. Andit was only yesterday, at the request of someof my friends, I met with the leaders of theAmerican Medical Association to seek theirassistance in advancing the cause of one ofthe greatest professions of allthe medical814professionin helping us to maintain andto improve the health of all Americans.And this is not just our traditionor thetradition of the Democratic Partyor eventhe tradition of the Nation. It is as old 2Sthe day it W2S first commanded: \"Thou shaltopen thine hand wide unto thy brother,to thy poor, to thy needy, in thy land.\"And just think, Mr. President, becauseof this documentand the long years ofstruggle which so many have put intocreating itin this town, and a thousandother towns likeit, there are men andwomen in pain who will now find ease.There are those, alone in suffering, who willnow hear the sound of some approachingfootsteps coming to help.There are thosefearing the terrible darkness of despairingpovertydespite their long years of laborand expectationwho will now look up tosee the light of hope and realization.There just can be no satisfaction, nor anyact of leadership, that gives greater satis-faction than this.And perhaps you alone, President Tru-man, perhaps you alone can fully know justhow grateful I am for this day.}tors: The President spoke at a:55 p.m. in theauditorium of the Harry S.

Everett Koop, M.D. 1 guess if I wanted to give you a Surgeon General's title for my remarks today it could be the 'American HealthCare System Could Be Dangerous to Your Health.'My views arc based on more than a half-a-century of medicine. The most important of those years, the last twoand one half years, I have been crisscrossing this Country looking at where we have been and where we are goingand perhaps where we should go. I must say that these problems are not new, and they have been around eversince I came into government in 1981 and before that_ I think it is clear that politicians dawdled until the crisisdeepened, and I think it is actually thc American people who have shamed them into action.There are three basic incompatible demands I think Americans have for their health care system:1. We demand easy access to health care.2. We want the highest high-tech medicine.3. We want it at a limited cost.You cannot have all three of those together. You can have any two at one time, but I don't think you can haveall three.To begin with, I think our big problem is that wc have very high expectations as a society from health and frommedicine. We put a great deal of faith in new procedures and surgery, new pharmaceuticals, and newtechnologies of all kinds. We still have a lot of faith in what !call the 'magic of medicine'. We routinely expectmiracles to happen, even when in the real world, the medical profession is not able to deliver. It has also becomeequally clear in recent years that those high expectations are fast outrunning our ability to pay for them. Ourhealth care system, may function with compassion, with competence, at times with excellence, but not forenough Americans. For too many of your fellow citizens, the health-care system in this country operates as atyranny. For them it is more a curse than it is a blessing.I think there is something terribly wrong with a health-care system or perhaps you should call it a non-systemthat spends more and more money to provide less and less service for fewer and fewer people each year. Butthat is a very apt, true description of what has happened to health care, especially in the last decade and a half.Like many of our national problems. this crisis is a very complicated one, and it will require a variety of solutions. 98 They will have to be in part Federal, regional, and local. They will have to bc public as well as private, and theywill also have to be personal. It is my absolute conviction that there is no panacea for the situation we find ourselvesinthere is no single magic bullet, no easy answers, only a series of very hard choices. We have to reform verywisely or we could find one of two things happening: either monolithic government medicine or private medicinerun amok . Now each of those is exorbitantly expensive, and neither one of them is sensitive to patients needs. If everyone that was interested in health-care reform was &person of goodwill (which he is not),and if all the peoplewith a plan could decide on one plan (which they cannot), and everything went as smcothly as it possibly could(which you know it will not), it will take us a year to get from where we are to where we ought to be in health-care reform. I think that is something the Congress doesn't seem to understand; I don't think either presidentialcandidate understands. One of the things that fiightens the life out of me is to read that Governor Clinton plansin the first 100 days to push a package in the Congress that will solve all of our health-care problems. My fearis that, with 741 health-care lobbies, a package will become so encrusted with barnacles that by the time it goesthrough Congress, you might get either one of these things I mentioned. It would not surprise me to see somethinghappen such as happened to catastrophic insurance in the Reagan term: a decent bill came forward, but by the timeit was massaged, it was so encumbered that it was not possible to fund it three years down the road. Usually debates about thc health-care crisis center very much around economics, but I would like to ask you toconsider whether or not they are not ethical as well. I think it would be much easier to enact rather sweepingreforms if the American people could agree on basic values and ethics upon which the health-care system and,indeed, our whole society is based. If we could reach an ethical consensus, a lot of economic and political barriersto success could be easily solved. You know that there are many factors that drive up the cost of health care. I think the most important of them isthe demand by every hospital in the lan.1 to have absolute state-of-the-art technokigy. Society demands that theyhave this. And hospitals copy each other so that they can turn a profit. Physicians fees have soared in the pastto astronomical levels. Wages for other health-care workers are escalating; buildings need replacement muchequipment is now obsolete; prices are raised for privately insured patients in order to cover the cost for those whohave no insurance; and we have a unique situation where new technology does not supplant old technology, itmerely compliments it. If any of you have anything to do with imaging, you know that 10 years ago CAT scanswere all the rage. Then we got MR1s, and you would think MRIs would just put CAT scans right off the map.That is not true. Now patients get both a CAT scan and a MRI S600 plus $1,200 and the cost of medical carecontinues to soar.Competition. I hope you all know that competition in health care increases costs. If you have a new mechanicwho is peat with automobile valves move into your town, the cost of a valve job on your car will eventually comedown, and probably quality will go up. But if a new cardiovascular surgeon comes to your town, the cost of a valvejob on your heart will go up without any guarantee that the quality will follow. It is not like buying and sellingtelevision sets because medicine's competition is based on service and not on price.To get back to why our prices are out-of-control -- pharmaceuticals are extremely high priced as is everythingin medicine. Most of the things you get in a hospital today are disposable. In our society, we equate throw-awayvith low cost, and that is absolutely not the case. Vv e have a very unique problem in America: the expense of defensive medicine. We have to cover the very litigioussociety we have today that tends to sue when any encounter with the medical profession is not perfection itself.Those things are enough to smother any system. Coverage But we have two problems that are not unique to us, the whole world faces them: 4 99 I. The emerging aging population with health-care costs per capita that are eight times more thanthey are for people under the age of 65.2. AIDS. No one knows the limits of the AIDS epidemic. We have already seen the cost go fromhundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions, and now we are up in the billions. And there is no end in sight.The disruption caused by the present system is unconscionable. Millions of Americans live in a special kind offear that they are only an illness or an accident away from financial disaster. I arn sure that you know each yearthousands upon thousands of Americans are literally impoverished by our health-care system.11'1 were to summarize what I have been trying to say, it is this: we have a health-care system with almostno self-regulation on the part of those who provide that care, namely hospitals and physicians. The systemis devoid of the natural market place controls that competition should bring, whether we are talking aboutprice, or quality, or service. Efforts so far have been to contain costs, and I think that focusing attentionon containing costs is like squeezing a balloon on the bottom but it bulges up somewhere else. Aroundthe country some cost containment policies have actually made health care even worse.Insurance. No doubt about the fact that our insurance system is a scandalous thing. It operates like a shell gamein many parts of the country. Wc end up by having 35 to 37 million of our fellow Americans either uninsuredor uninsurable or only seasonally insured. A, certain times of the year, they have no coverage at all. The twoother things that are very important for the insurance system to recognize arc \"job-lock\", where you can't leavebecause if you do you lose your insurance, and the other is that many people cannot get insurance because theyhave\"pre-existing conditions.\" For this group of about two and one-half million Americans, the plight of beinguninsurable is really extraordinarily unreasonable. We have to bring insurance companies if needed by Congressional mandateinto a position where instead of making their money on the basis of how well theycan cherry pick (pick out communities and individuals with high risk), they have to be forced to have poolssufficiently large so that health care becomes available and affordable to every single American.Wc have to replace the regressive employer tax exceptions for insurance with tax credits or vouchers that linkindividual insurance coverage with one's ability to pay. That is certainly something that could replace Medicare.One of the things I think bothers most Americans I talk to is that 26 cents out of every insurance dollar is spenton administration. There arc 1160 insurance forms that physicians use. They can be replaced by Congresstomorrow by mandate, with one form, or perhaps you want to be very generous and have three, that cover mostsituations very well. But the long term goal could be to get rid of paper entirely and report insurance claimsand medical records electronically so that if you are in Des Moines, Iowa, or Portland, Maine, your medicalrecord is availabl: to the physician at the push of a button.The way doctors offices' function these days is one of the most daunting things about medical practice. I havebeen spending a lot of time in New Hampshire lately, and in New Hampshire, it is not easy to make money asa generalist. The population is rural, widely separated, and some parts of it not economically well-off.Physicians are quitting. The reason they are quitting has nothing to do with patients; it has to do with theoverburdening paper work they have to do. There is no doubt about the fact that a dcctor's office spends moretime on the paper work for a given patient than that physician does looking after the patient.Poverty. Now you cannot talk about illness and health unless you recognize that we treat diseases of the bodybut there are some diseases which stem from society. In this rich country, the number one disease is the shamefulprevalence of poverty. It lies at the root of most of our public health problems. I give you an example: WhenI was Surgeon General, and I was hitting my head against thc wall about many things, whether it was drug abuse. KIDS, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, smoking or lack of immunization, it was fundamentally poverty that madethese problems what they are. And the discouraging statistics that we have in public health, such as high infant es. 100 mortality, really come from the impoverished millions of our citiz who exist on the very fringes of aotherwise affluent society. Health. We must not mistake health care for health because they are not identical. It may come as a surpriseto you thatIthink that although that is true and many Americans have too little health care, the real problemin America is that too many people have too much health care. Health care is our costliest nationalenterprise, this year estimated to be in excess of $800 billion. The reason this is the case is that we do notknow what works and what does not work in the theory and the practice of medicine. And further,doctors make their decisions on the value systems that they enjoy or that the profession has dictatedrather than on the value systems of the public.Letme tell you what I mean. If somebody is 60 years old and gets up at night, throe times to use the bathroom,sits on the aisle in the movies or an airplane because he has to go the John frequently, he probably has benignprostatic hyperplasia and eventually will end up in the hands of a urologist. It is now uncommon today for sucha urologist to put his arm around this guy and say, \"Harry. I will bring you to the hospital Thursday afternoon.We will cystoscope you. I'll take a little of your prostate, open your urethra, and you will be as good as new.\"Hemighteventell Harry what some of the risks are. That is not truly informed consent. That is getting thepatient to sign onto what you have already decided to do with the patient. I think what you ought to do is to say, \"Harry, you have a benign disease that is never going to kill you. Thereare five ways you can treat it. Let me outline them for you and tell you what the risks and the benefits are. Youdecide with me what you want to do. One, we can open your belly, open your bladder, take out your prostrate,and throw it away. Two, we can do a cystoscope procedure and take out a little prostrate. Three, we haveballoons we can put in the urethra and just blow them up, dilate the urethra, push back the prostrate, and thatwill last for 6 to 8 years. Four, there arc two new drugs that shrink the prostrate. Fifth choice is do nothing andcontinue getting up at night. Let me tell you what the risks arc. You might be incontinent; you might beimpotent; you might have a hemorrhage; you might die.\" When you put all that on the table, it is fascinatingthat patients chose low-tech, low-cost health care. In four communities, where my Dartmouth colleagues have gotten all the urologists to do this not by askingthem to do it the same way but by putting an interactive videodisk beforethe patiem. Everybody gets exactlythe same advice and exactly the same ability to ask the same questions. The costs of prostatic care droppedin those four cities 40 to 45 percent. That is what I mcan about knowing what works and what does not work. That is \"outcomes research.\"Outcomesresearch. My idea is that we make insurance companies give us one-quarter of one cent on everydollar they take in to fund outcomes research in this country. If we did that, in ten ycars, we would know whatworked and what did not. Then when someone in this room had ea have a breast procedure done, she wouldknow the batting averages of every hospital in the communIty and the batting averages of every doctor.Outcomes research is the buzz word for the rest of thi -!:,:a.de. If you can make it mandatory, we would havea health cart system where we would practice medicine on the basis on what works and what does not work. Outcomes research also tells you about tremendous variations. To give you an example, in Boston today thenumber of hospital beds utilized and the cost per capita is almost twice what it is in New Haven, Connecticut,which is just a little way down thc Atlantic coast. Now there is no evidence that the people in Boston are twiceas sick or need twice as many hospital beds or arc twice as well afterward or are twice ashappy about what happened tothem. lhe bottom lineis: if you couldshift thc New Haven system to Boston, the annual savingsin excess of hospital beds alone would be $3130 million. Now justhow many cities around the countrycould save$300 million and what $300 million and $303 million and $300 million would add up tO. whileI am on that subject, let me tell you what the buzzword for that is \"reallocation of resources.\" 12 .0 101 Everyone hears about the Oregon health plan. Oregon is rationing health care. I have defended Oregon in saying,there is nothing new about that, we are all rationing health care. But Oregon actually decided to ration healthcam only to the poor. Oregon has the second highest Medicaid administrative costs in the country. MyDarunouth colleagues, with Oregon's permission, went in and studied the situation. They found that if theycut down their empty hospital beds, put their extra CAT scan or extra NIVEL. L..a disuse, and reallocatedtbeir resources, they could have given every poor person in the state of Oregon a full package of healthcare. If you are thinking about rationing as the answer to our problems, be sure that you don't do that until youlook at how you can reallocate your resources.Change. In the reform of the Federal health-care system several things have to happen at the same time. It islike a football game: when the ball is snapped if everybody does not react at the same time, the play is a flop.Today we se e in a situation that sounds like the last minutes of the last quarter of a losing game. Everybody inthe huddle I. shouting what the play should be, and there is only on person who could call that play, the coach.We don't have a coach. Wc need a coach, and I think the coach has to be the President.I want to tell you very honestly that I outlined a plan for Mr. Bush after he was nominated and before he waselected on the 14 August 1988, which, had he undertaken, would have resulted in no health-care crisis at all atthe present time. It still is not too late to do it, and I'll tell you what I told him. (I wrote it up later in NewsWeek)1 have tried to get it across to Mr. Clinton. It is simply this and I know as soon as you hear me saying a fewwords, you will say, oh, no, not that again we need the bluest of blue ribbon commissions to solve this problem.It should have on it, doctors, lawyers, administrators, statesmen, but the most important thing is Republican andDemocratic Congresspersons and Senators, who, by accepting the position on the commission would agree toattend all the meetings themselves and not send their staff as substitutes.Now what that does is enable those people to become knowledgeable. They would expound a cause, and theyare the only people who can take a plan from a commission back to the floors of Congress where they can leadthe debate and where something will come about. That is how this country got social security. I know thisPresident hates commissions. I know many people hate commissions, but this one would work.The great advantage of doing it now, is that it buys time, and it prevents the scramble that I think is going totake place no matter who is president. It avoids the business of all those barnacles on a bill that might of itselfbe good, but would be so encumbered that it becomes impossible legislation. The other thing to do is, insteadof sitting down at the table the fast day and deciding on the agenda for the next year, as commissions tend todo, you could give them their homework already done for them. Present them with 14, or 15, or 17, or 9 whitepapers which are the only possible answers to the dilemmas we face. Two weekends of heavy reading couldput them in the position to start to act.I have been interest in health care reform for 25 years. I have been especially interested in health care reformever since I entered government as your Surgeon General.I have gottcn very discouraged about doing anything about it because no matter what administration is in powcrit seems to be paralyzed, our Congress seems to be paralyzed, and nothing seems to happen. It is a very dauntingtask when you think about what has to happen: you have to revise Medicare and Medicaid; you have to dosomcthing about the unwarranted freedom of the insurance industry; you have to do something about malpracticereform because this legalistic society makes it impossible for medicine to function the way i: should; and thenyou have all the problems of fraud, waste and abuse. And let me say parenthetically, any health-care reform thatdoes not address fraud, waste and abuse is not going to go over big with the American people because they setit as a very corrupt system, not just doctors, but hospitals, and politicians who have made it that way.I arn delighted that the health-care crisis has worked its way to the top of the national agenda. It is about time. 102Health Care in Rural America SUM M A R YReproduced from Health Care in Rural America: summary. Washington, Officeof Technology Assessment, 1990. 26 p.

Recently, however, these policieshave received renewed scrutiny in the face of reported increasu in rural host::: -1 closures,ongoing problems in recruiting and retaining health personnel, and difficulty in providingmedical technologies commonly available in urban areas. Mounting concerns related to ruralresidents' access to health care prompted the Senate Rural Health Caucus to request that OTAconduct an assessment of these and related issues. This report, Health Care in Rural Anserica,is the final product of that assessment. (Two other OTA papers, Rural Emergency MedicalServices and Defining \"Rural\" Areas: Impact on Health Care Policy and Research, havepreviously been published in connection with this assessment.)An advisory panel, chaired by Dr. James Bernstein of the North Carolina Office of RuralHealth and Resource Development, provided guidance and assistance during the assessment.Also, three public meetings were held (in Scottsdale, Arizona; Bismarck, North Dakota; andMeridian, Mississippi) to provide OTA with the opportunity to discuss specific rural healthtopics with local and regional health practitioners, administrators, and officials. Site visits tolocal facilities were conducted in association with these activities. A number of individualsfrom both government and the private sector provided information and reviewed drafts of thereport.OTA gratefully acknowledges the contribution of each of these individuals.

Thisconcern prompted the Senate Rural Health Caucusand the Ranking Minority Member of the SenateCommittee on Labor and Human Resources torequest that OTA a w.ss thc availability of healthservices in rural communities, the problems ruralproviders face, and the remedial strategies that mightbe influenced by Federal policy.'This report focuses on trends in the availability ofprimary and acute health care in rural ireas andfactors affecting those trends.2 The rest of thissummary presents OTA's fmdings and conclusionson rural health care availability and options forcongressional consideration. Many of these optionsbear some similarity to proposals by others toimprove rural health care services, although thedetails may differ considerably. The report itselfexamines in detail the issues faced by rural facilitiesproviding health services and by physicians andother rural health persoaneL To provide examples ofhow these issues rnay play out, it also discusses inmore depth two specific grams of services: maternaland infant health services and mental health serv-ices.Although the affordabiliti of health care is animportant factor in access to :are by rural residents,the fundamental issue of unit sured populations anduncompensated care is beyoad the scope of thisreport, since it encompasses the urban as well as therural health care system and has broad ramifications.Moreover, even if it were possible to enable allpatients to adequately compensate providers, policy-makers would still find it necessary to considermeasures to overcome the special access problemsof underserved areas and populations. Thus, thereport does not discuss in depth either healthinsurance coverage or health care financing. Instead,it considers these factors in terms of their influenceon the availability and financial viability of providers.Two other important issues are also beyond thescope of this report. First, the importance of ruralhealth care providers as sources of employment andiocome is not addressed here, although it is a vitalissue in many rural communities. Second. this reportdoes not examine the quality of rural health care inany detail, although itis clear that the qualityimplications of rural health interventions deservescrutiny. But such an examination would have toproceed with care. By necessity, an evaluation of thequality of a service provided in rural areas must bemeasured against the implications of having nolocally available service at all.PROBLEMS ANDCONSIDERATIONS IN RURALHEALTH CAREThe Health and Health Care Accessof Rural ResidentsDuring this century, the rural population hasbecome an increasingly smaller proportion of thetotal U.S. population (figure 1). As of 1988, about 23percent of the U.S. population lived in nonmetro-politan (nonmetro) counties (24). About 27 percentof the U.S. population lives in \"rural\" areas asdefined by the Census Bureau (places of 2,500 orfewer resideats) (25), and slightly more than 15percent of the populanon is rural by both defini-tioos.3 Throughout this report, \"rural\" refers tononmetro areas unless otherwise stated.Rural residents are characterized by relativelylow mortality but relatively high rates of chronicdisease.

September due to age, race, and sex distributions between urbanand rural areas, mortality rates in rural areas are 4percent lower than in urban areas (21). Two notableexceptions exist: in rural areas, infant mortality isslightly higher (10.8 v. 10.4 per 1,000 infants), andinjury-related mortality is dramatically higher (0.6 v.0.4 per 1,000 residents). Chronic illness and disabil-ity, on the other hand, affect a greater proportion ofthe rural than the urban population (14 V. 12 percent)(29).4 There is little overall difference betweenurban and rural residents in rates of acute illness.Rural populations are unique in the extent ofphysical barriers they may encounter when obtain-ing health care. Even in relatively well-populatedrural areas, the lack of a public transportation systemand the existence of few local providers to chooseTrom can make it difficult for many rural residents toreach facilities where they can receive care. Andpersons living in low-density 'frontier\" countiescounties of six or fewer persons per square milecan have geographic access pr.,blems of immenseproportions. In these counties, predominantly lo-cated in the West, there is insufficient populationdensity in many areas to adequately barriers prevent many rural residentsfrom receiving adequ= health care and oftenoutweigh strictly physical barriers. Rural residentshave lower average incomes and higher povertyrates than do urban residents, and one out of everysix rural families lived in poverty in 1987 (23).While some rural areas have prospered (e.g., areasthat have become retirement havens), areas whoseeconomies are based on farming and mining sufferedreal decreases in per capita income during the firsthalf of the 1980s (5). Still other rural areas have beenpockets of poverty for decades. These areas ofpersistent poverty are heavily concentrated in theSouth, where 25 million of the Nation's 57 millionrural residents live, and where 4 out of every 10 ruralresidents are poor, elderly, or both (26).Rural residents are much more likely than urbanresidents to have no health insurance coverage (18.2 *Thew Spree arc me-adjusted and therefore cannot be explsined by a greater proportion of elderly residans in rural areas Figure 2Trends in Hospital Utilization by Matron\u00b0 Man and Marlene Nees).

Over time, people inboth areas have increased the number of physicianvisits per person, although rural physician utilizationremains below that for urban residents. Hospitalinpatient utilization by both urban and rural resi-dents has declined (figure 2). Rural residents,however, still report more admissions and shorterhospital staysthando urban residents(29).6The Availability of Rural Health CareRural health care availability in 1990 is better inmany ways than that of 20 years ago. After years ofhospital construction, the ratio of community hospi-tal beds to population is now about the same in ruralas in urban areas (4.0 and 4.1 per 1,000 residents,respectively, in 1986).

Physician supplyhas been increasing for many years in both rural andurban areas; one out of every 440 people in theUnited States is now a physician?Nonetheless, the future prospect for rural healthcare in the absence of intervention is grim. RuralAmerica cannot support its present complement ofhospitals, and the hospitals are going broke. By1987, rural hospitals as a group had higher expensesthan patient care revenues, and small rural hospitalshad higher expenses than revenues from all sources.Hospitals faced with continuing fmancial difficul-ties and no alternative fonns of survival willcontinue to close, including some facilities that arethe only reasonable source of care in their ccinuman-ties. Rather than drawing local patients back to localcare, many small community facilities will continueto lose wealthier patients to more distant urbanhospitals and clinics. Local facilities will be left tocontend with low occupancy rates and a highproportion of patients who cannot pay the full costsof their care. A lack of incentives and models fordeveloping appropriate networks of care may resultin an increasingly fragmented health service deliv-ery system.Rural areas are finding it increasingly difficult torecruit and retain the variety of qualified healthpersonnel they need. In some isolated and \"unattrac-tive\" areas, 7.1i absolute lack oi providers maybecome a chronic situation. The number of areasdesignated by the Federal Government as primarycare Health Manpower Shortage Areas (HMSAs)has not changed significantly since 1979. And in1988, 111 counties in the United States, with a totalpopulation of 325,100, had no physicians at all (31).Half a million rural residents live in counties with nophysician trained to provide obstetric care; 49million live in counties with no psychiatrist. Statesoverwhelmingly rate health personnel shortages as atop problem area and a top focus of State rural healthactivities (22).No single strategy is appropriate to all ruralareas or all health care providers. Rural NorthDakota is not the same as rural Mississippi. Ruralhealth problems and issues vary dramatically byregion, State, and locality. The success of strategiesto address these problems will also vary, and somestrategies that axe vital to a few communities mayoffer little to others. Furthermore, even in a singleState or locality, multiple approaches are more likelythan single strategies to obtain results.The Federal Government cannot fix all ruralhealth problems. It cannot force community consen-sus, or create new structures directly adapted to localneeds, or overcome all State-level barriers to change.But it can create an environment that facilitates theseactivities, it can furnish the information States andcommunities need to know before undertaking them,and it can be the catalyst for great improvements inthe rural health care system. The Federal Role in Rural HealthThe States are heavily dependent on the FederalGovernment for assistance in maintaining and en-hancing rural health care resources; nearly one-half(44 percent) of their resources for rural healthactivities (e.g., personnel recruitment) come fromFederal sources (22). Federal health insurance pro-grams such as Medicare are a large additionalFederal investment in rural health Care. \"Me timber is calculated from table 2. which include, only MDs.

Both programadifferentiate in a number of ways between rural andurban providers and payment to those providers.Both programs also include special exemptions togeneral payment rules for certain rural facilities andaervices (e.g., Physician services provided in certainHMSAs).Second is the health block grant, under which theFederal Government allocates funds to States tospend on any of a variety of propams in a generaltopic area. Three major block grants influence ruralhealth services: the Maternal and Child Health blockgrant; the Preventive Health and Health Servicesblock grant; and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, andMental Health block grant.Third are Federal programs for which enhancingrural health resources is an explicit goal. Box Apresents some major programs in this category.A fourth critical Federal activity is that ofcoordinating, undataking, and funding rmearch onrural health topics. Major Federal agencies involvedin this activity are the Office of Rural Health Policy(ORHP) mid the Agency for Health Cue Policy andRescsrcb.A major challenge in designing Federal ruralhealth policies is to identify those areas whereresidents' access to basic health care is ..FR- ;mulyendangered to justify special protective measures.Endangered areasthose with chronic shortages ofhealth personnel, for examplerequire special at-tention and ongoing subsidies of providers in orderto ensure a basic level of adequate health care to arearesidents. Although the present HMSA and Medi-cally Undersaved Area (MUA) designations haveshortcomings, the basic concept of designatingareas of personnel shortage and areas of poorhealth is sound. &Sending this cancels: to encom-pass rural hospitals and other facilities wouldenable more appropriate targeting of Federal healthfluids to needy rural areas.Many rural areas see prospering and have suffi-cient health resources, although these resources mayDor AFederalPrograms To Enhance RuralHealth ResourcesFedaal rural health mama programs include.:the National Health Service Corps, stich (inaddition to having sane commissioned mem-bers) provides placement services, scholar-ships, and educational loon repayment forphysicians and certain other health profusion-als willing to serve in certain designatedHMSAcprograms that provide grant: to school: thr-owing and training primary care providers(e.g., family practitioners, physician assis-tants, and nurses);the Federal Area Health Education Centersprogram, which links medical centers withrural practice sites to provide educuionalservices and mral clinical experienas tostudents, faculty, sal practitioners in a varietyof health profeuions;rhe Community and Migrant Health Centersgrant programs, which are the Federal Gov-ernment's most prominent activities to pro-mote primary health care facilities in nwalWM;Primary Care Cooperative Agreements,through which the Federal Government assistsStates that me assessing needs for primaryhealth case and developing plans and informa-tion to address those ncedu andthe Rural Health Care Transition Grant pro-gram, established in 1988, which providesgrants to small mral hospitals for strategicplanning and service enhancement not always be available or provided in an efficientmarr.c.... Others have temporary health care prob-lems, ar I in still other areas health providers facefinancia crises because they are losing their mostlucrative patients to urban hospitals and physicians.In rural areas without critical and chronic problemsof endangered access, Federal policies are moreappropriately oriented towards measures to en-hance the capabilities of providers, encourage theiradaptation to changes in the health care environ-ment, and mitre consistent and fair parsentpolicies.

Effectivetargeting of Federal resources to rural areasrequires the involvement of the States. State involve-ment includes not only enlisting the assistance ofState and local agencies in identifying critical areasbut enabling States and localities to adopt and adaptprograms tailored to their own needs. Nearly one-half of States-21 of 44 States responding to anOTA surveyalready rely on their own designationcriteria instead of (or in addition to) Federal criteriafor identifying underserved areas.The enormous diversity across States in ruralhealth problems suggests that it is also appropriateto maintain a strong State role in designing andimplementing solutions. But State capabilities tocarry out this role successcully vary considerably.Federal coordination, technical assistance, and in-formation are crucial to States and communitiestrying to address their rural health needs.RURAL HEALTH SERVICES:ISSUES AND OPTIONSIssuesThe 1980s brought major changes to the Nation'srural community hospitals, as medical practices,technologies, and payment systems all acted toreplace inpatient procedures with outpatient careand as remaining inpatient care became increasinglysophisticated. Both rural and urban hospitals wit-nessed substantial declines in inpatient utilir.rion(table 1). Changes in rural hospitals, however, wereespecially dramatic. Rural hospital occupancy rates9in 1988 were only 56 percent, compared with over68 pereent for urban community hospitals (2). Withlower inpatient admissions, rural hospitals havebecome more dependent on outpatient and long-termcare revenue. By 1987, nearly one-half (46 percent)of rural hospital surgery was performed on outpa-tients. One-fourth of rural hospitals have long-termcare units, and in these hospitals long-term care bedsmake up nearly one-half of the total beds (20).These major declines in inpatient utili7ation,compounded by increasing amounts of uncom-pensated care, have undermined the fmancial healthof many rural hospitals.

Mostcommunities in which hospitals closed appear tocontinue to have reasonable access to emergencyand acute care.In fact,one of the greatest problems ruralhospitals face is the outmigrafion of rural residentsto urban areas for care.Studies suggest that ruralrestdents (especially young and affluent residents)have been increasingly seeking care outside theirown conununities, either to obtain specialized carenot available locally or to obtain alternatives tolocally available services (44.7.17).Problemsby publicly funded facilities thatprovide primary care services are somewhat differ-ent from those faced by hospitals. Prom 1984 to1988 the number of rural C/MHC service sitesremained relatively constant, but patient visits torural C/MHCs rose nearly 19 percent during thisperiod(30)Most of the increase in utilizationappears to be by rural residents unable to pay the fullcosts of their care.By 1987, nearly one-half of allruralCIMHC users received discounted care.More-over, Medicaid-reimbursed visits constitute an in-creasing proportion of revenues, while the propor-rion of revenues from private pay patients hasdecreased (30). Consequently, C/MHCs remainheavily dependent on Federal grant funds, whichmake up nearly one-half of total revenues.Despite their heavy Federal dependence, niralC/MHCs receive 15 percent less Federal funding perpatient served than do their urban counterparts (9).Factors such as differences in the complexity of carepatients require may explain some of the differencein funding but have not been studied in detail.Rural health care facilities have a number ofoptions in adjusting to recent changes in the healthcare and fiscal environment, ranging from short-term options such as staff consolidation and reduc-tion to longer term strategies such as diversificationand participation in multifacility alliances. Butmany rural facilities have not successfully appliedthese strategies. WEIrets pima of mil boopitato 4-1( Pob of sparse theavailability of even the most basic locai nral healthservices.One major barrier to the successful implementationof strategies is simple lack of community andprovider will, particularly in cases where groupshave differing views on appropriate actions. Buteven when providers have a fum direction andcommittment, they can be stymied by a lack ofinformation on the success of alternative possiblestrategies, and the lack of community and providertechnical expertise and financial resources to under-take strategic planning and other important steps.Other especially important structural barriers caninclude:119 standards and requirements for Rural HealthClinics (RIICs)andC/MHCs, including delaysin the RHC certification process and C/MHCefficiency standards that may be difficult forsmall or isolated C/MHCs to meet;regulations to prevent fraud and abuse thatmayinhibit hospitals from engaging in someactions that would encourage physicians topractice in a rural area;State licensure restrictionsthat prevent hospi-tals from reducing the scope of services (e.g.,converting to a facility that offers only enter-gency, subacute, and primary care); andrestrictions on public hospital activities thatprevent the 42 perces, of rural hospitals that arepublicly owned from providing services notexpressly or implicitly permitted by their en-abling manes.Summary and Options9 Federal intervention will have limited effect onsome of these barriers. But the Federal Governmentcan avoid policies that send contradictory messagesto rural providers. For example, it may be appropri-ate for many rural hospitals with low occupancyrates to reorient their services to place more empha-sis on outpatient care. Any changes in Federalpayment policies for ambulatory surgical servicesthat assumed an unrealistically low cost of providingsuch services, however, might dissuade these hospi-tals from making appropriate changes. Uninten-tional disincentives could be minimized by perform-ing a detailed analysis of the impact of any proposednew payment system on rural providers beforeadopting such a system.In addition to evaluating potential new healthpolicies for their impact on rural facilities, theFederal Government could take a number of specificsteps to identify and protect essential rural healthservices, and to enhance the abilities of all ruralproviders to respond appropriately to changcs in thehealth care and economic environment. Options forundertaking these steps arc presented below.Options for Congressional ActionIdentifying and Supporting EssentialRural Health FacilitiesIn some rural areas, particularly those with highpoverty or very low population density, a singlefacility may be the only provider of some of thecommunity's vital services. At a minimum, thesevital services include basic emergency, primary,acute, and long-tem care.At present there are several programs aimed atidentifying (and supporting) facilities providing oneor more of these services, specifically the C/MHCgrant programs and Medicare's payment exceptionsfor designated RHCs, Sole Community Hospitals(SCHs), Essential Access Community Hospitals,and Rural Primary Care Hospitals. The assumptionof each of Mese programs is that Federal subsidies orspecial exceptions to payment rules wii enableservices to be provided to populations whose healthcare access might otherwise be severely impaired.Existing programs, howevermost notably theSCI4 programimperfectly identify these facilities.Furthermore, each program has its own uniquecriteria that may not be relevant to other applica-tions. One potential direction for Federal policy is toundertake a niore concerted effort to identify (option 4\"-'5) (120 10Health Care in Rural America 1) and protect (suboptions 1A-1C) a broad range ofnri1 facilities.Option 1: Develop criteria to identify healthfacilities that provide essential emergency,primary, acute, and long-term care in specifiedrural areas, and develop programs to providesupport for these facilities.The Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) could be directed, with assistance from theStates,to make a comprehensive effort to developcriteria that could be used to designate essentialfacilities and services, which would then be eligiblefor a variety of Federal and State protections.Criteria could distinguish among facilities for whichno reasonable alternatives exist, facilities for whichalternatives exist but are more distant or otherwiseless accessible, and all other facilities. Programsusing the facility designations thus might be appliedto either the most narrowly or the more broadlydefmed groupof \"essential\"facilities.Designation criteria for essential facilities mightinclude:distance/time to nearest comparable and near-est higher level service or facility, considerinpgeographical and transportation limitations;level of medical underservice and indigence ofthe areapopulation;institution's area market share and measures ofcommunity acceptance (e.g., utilization pat-terns);evidence of plans or actions by the facility toserve critical unmet needs of the local commu-nity; andother relevant factors (e.g., number of Medicarebeneficiaries served).From the Stare perspective. Federal criteria oftenseem inflexible and not adaptable to relevant localconditions.To minimize this problem, the develop-ment of designation criteria should include the inputand active involvement of State governments. Stateflexibility would be further enhanced by the web-lislunent of:mirdnisun criteriato aid the Federal Gov-ernment in basic and fair allocation of fundsamoug Suites; andless restrictive criteriato enable States to useand modify the designations for their ownpurposes, and to enable more flexibility in theapplication of Federal programs to variouslyidentified facilities.Some of the difficulties of applying detailedcriteria from the perspective of the Federal Govern-ment could be avoided by requiring States toactually apply Ibe criteria and make the designations(see option 2). The Federal role could be restrictedto technical support and assistance, reviewing andapproving desigpations and affirming that the desig-nated facilities were eligible for relevant Federalprograms. Facilities, once designated, could also beperiodically \"recertified\" in order to remove thosefacilities no longer meeting the criteria.Option IA: Provide direct grants and subsidies toeligible facilities.These could include:Time-limited subsidiesto maintain operations,and to plan and implement strategies to changethe scope or delivery of services (e.g., 1- to3-year grants through an expanded RuralHealth Care Transition Grant Program).Continued grant support andlor special altera-tions in public sources of reimbursement tomaintain and enhance operations for facilitiesdeemed unable to achieve self-sufficiency dueto isolation or high levels of unreimburted care.For example, designated hospitals could con-tinue to receive reimbursement exceptionsunder the Medicare program. Alternatively, theSCH exception could be phased out altogether,and general subsidy grants analogous to thoseprovided to C/MHCs could be made availableto all eligible hospitals, separating the subsidiesfrom the Medicare program.Option IB: Require the Farmers Home Admin-istration (FmHA), the Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD), and other Fed-eral agencies to give special attention to theneeds of essential rural health facilities whenmating available loans to institutions for capitalimprovement.Many essential rural hospitals and clinics maylack adequate aocess to capital for diversifyingservices and converting facilities to other functices.Many of these providers' basic facilities and equip-ment also may need upgrading to maintain quality ofcare and conform to Federal and State regulations.Increased availability of capital dzough PmHAdirect and guaranteed loans and HUD loan guarantee 121 Summary and OpaonsI I programs could help to ensure the financial stabilityand presence of these facilities.Option IC: Protect essential facilitiesfrorn Federalfraud and abuse regulations that inhibit theirability to recruit and retain physicians or to beacquired by physicians.Close organizational association with physiciansmay be the only financially feasible strategy forlong-term survival for some tural facilities, and foressential facilities the benefits of financial stabilitymay sometimes outweigh the dangers of potentialconflicts of interest. A specified \"safe harbor\" iromfraud and abuse regulations, or a legislative exemp-tion to these laws, could provide for the arrange-ments these facilities might make to ensure theavailability of a local physician (e.g.. free onsiteoffice space). In addition, specified \"safe bathos\"practices could encompass the purchase of small,failing hospitals by local physicians wishing toensure the availability of this resource. Whole orpartial physician ownership of health care facilitiesmay be an especially attractive option in the case ofsmall \"alternative liceasure\" facilities that providemostly primary, emergency, and subacute care.To guard against abuse of this exemption, restric-tions could specify that incentives be independent ofthe number of patients thc physician refers to thefacility, or that a facility wishing to acquire aphysician practice could Dot exclude other localphysicians from its staff. Also, facilities could beprecluded from listing recruitment and retentioncosts on their Medicare cost reports.Option 2: Provide assistance to States to helpthem identify essential facilifis, remove regu-latory barriers applying to these facilities, andoffer State-based financial support to a moreflexible set of designated facilities.Option 2A: Provide time-limited (I- to 3-year)grants for the development of State-designatedoffices of rural health to enable States to bettersupport rural health efforts.The Federal ORTIP is an important part of theFederal effort to assess rural health program needsand respond to information needs. Organizationsthat can carty out equivalent duties at die State levelare likewise important. As of February 1990, 19States had instituted (and 5 more had plans for)State-designated offices of =al health (14,22).(Locations of existing offices were almost evenlydivided between State agencies and nonprofit organ-izations.) Thirty-four States reported the existenceof legislative or executive task forces or committeesto address State rural health issues (22). ThirteenStates, however, have neither an office of ruralhealth nor a State rural health task force.Option 28: Provide time-limited or ongoing grantsto Stases to help them undertake spec* activitiesrelating to essential and other rural healthfacilities.Such grants could enable States to:identify and designate essential facilities andservices;monitor the financial condition of essentialfacilities and services, protect against un-desirable closure, and examine the compa-rability and acceptability of the nearest healthcare facilities;provide technical assistance to enhance leader-ship and management skills, support strategicplanning, encourage reconfiguration of serv-ices and cooperative affiliations with otherinstitutions, and remit critical staff;help subsidize existing statewide capital fi-nancing sources and/or uncompensated carepools, making them more accessible to essen-tial facilities;encourage special local tax initiatives and thecreation of health service districts, where ap-propriate, to maintain and expand services;study the impact of Federal and State regula-tions on essential facilities, disseminate infor-mation clarifying State and Federal regulatoryrequirements, and develop model State legisla-tive and regulatory language; andidentify areas without access even to essentialprimary and other care facilities, and providefunds to establish new facilities in these areas.Encouraging Comprehensive andCoordinated Rural Health CareRural patients and providers are often bothphysically and professionally isolated. As a resultthey may be unable to obtain consultation andinformation and unaware of appropriate alternativesources of care. They may receive little feedback andfew resources from regional providers.Option 3: Award small Federal grants to projectswhose goal is the development of model ruralhealth care networks. 122 12Health Care in Rural America Short-term demonstration and developmentgrants could be awarded by DHHS to States ornonprofit organizations to:identify special basic care need areas in geo-graphically remote and persistent poverty com-munities, identify minimum service needs, andcreate and evaluate the effectiveness of servicenetworks in those areas:identify regional needs and service resourcesfor comprehensive and integrated care in re-gions not designated as special basic care needareas, and create and demonstrate integratedcare networks in those regions: anddevelop regional referral networks for specificservices and population groups needing partic-ular attention, using (and expanding) the peri-natal network model.Some aspects of this option are already in place;for example, under Primary Care Cooperative Agree-ments, States can receive funds to help identifyneeds in underserved areas. Private organizations,however, cannot receive funds directly at present forthis purpose.As an alternative to a new funding program, theRural Health Care Transition Grant program couldbe expanded. A proportion of these grant fundscould be directed specifically to funding for con-sortia of hospitals and other providers wishing todevelop model arrangements for transferring andreferring patients, and for enhancing local carethrough periodic scecialty clinics and continuingeducation seminars.Longer Term Assessment of the Future of theRural Health Care Delivery SystemInnovative responses to existing barriers tochange include measures to modify State hospitalficensure laws to permit tbe operatioa of facilitiesthat provide less than full-service hospital ace. Twoexamples are Montana's Medical Assistance Facili-ties and California's proposal for basic facilitieswhose Dome categor; would depend on the extentof services they offer. The Federal Government hastaken similar steps with the enactment of theOmnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law10I-239), which permits Medicare payment to smallrural facilities that are designated Rural PrimaryCare Hospitals (RPCHs) in a limited number ofStates. But the RPCH is not necessarily the only orthe best model for all rural areas, and the ability ofother facility models to be eligible for Medicare andMedicaid payment remains highly uncertain.The need for such \"alternative licensure\" facili-ties, the variety of proposals, and the potentialimportance of these facilities to the rural healthcaresystem warrant a comprehensive and ongoing anal-ysis to ease their incorporation into the system.Adapting the system to accommodate these facilitiesintroduces a myriad of questions: how to pay for theservices they provide, how to integrate them into acomprehensive and coordinated system of care, andhow to ensure that they continue to provide servicesvital to their communities. Answering these ques-tions requires tbe input and coordination of informa-tion from a variety of Federal and State agencies.The recently established ORHP and the NationalAdvisory Committee on Rural Health were created.in part, to address such issues At present. ORHP hasa very small staff and a wide range of responsibility;the Advisory Committee considers a similarly broadrange of issues and meets only four times each yet:These limitations at present prevent an immt& e,intense examination of the structure of the ruralhealth care system.Option 4: Establish a short-term (18-24 month)advisory task force whose purpose is to exam-ine the future of rural health delivery systems2nd to provide guidance on the implementa-tion of new service delivery structures.Ideally, the task force, comprising both public-and private-sector experts in rural health and healthcare financing, would meet frequently and wouldadvise DHHS and Congress. It could be coordinatedwith the current Advisory Committeefor example,by having representatives from the Advisory Com-mittee serve as part of the short-term task force. 11Jtask force could be staffed by an augmented CAMPto eliminate duplication of effort.The immediate objectives of the task force couldinclude:1. assisting DIMS in the development of criteriafor identifying essential facilities (see option2. developing guideline* under which projectsmay demonstrate the feanbility of allernativefacility and service delivery models and (ifnecessary) obtain waivers from Medicare andMedicaid certification requirements; 123 Summary and Options13 3. expanding and coordinating discussion onpotential methods of payment to these facili-ties (e.g., prospective payment groups, inte-grated payment for physician and hospitalservices); and4. providing directions for research and dem-onstration efforts supporting the developmentof model service delivery networks in ruralareas (see optioc 6).To ensure that the recommendations of the taskforce could be implemented, DHIIS would need tomaintain or develop complementary expertise. Forexample, DHHS staff might need to be able to:compile, analyze, arxl make available informationon existing efforts to develop model servicestructures and networks;help States and local communities to identifyregional needs and determine standards foracceptable access to comprehensive services;andparticipate in the development of both newprojects to demonstrate innovative service andfacility categories in rural areas (e.g., subacutecare facilities) and networks involving suchproviders.Addressing Information NeedsOption 5: Expand basic research on access tohealth care in rural areas.Specific topics that DHHS could be encouraged ormandated to study include:Nationwide migration patterns of rural resi-dents for health services outside their localcommunities, why they occur, and their impacton the economic viability of local healthservices (particularly obstetrics services).How travel distances and transportation limita-tions affect access to hospital care in ruralWAS.The costs to rural hospitals, under differentconditions, of restructuring their organizationand services in various ways (e.g., capital.operating, and regulatory costs of downsizinghospitals to alternative delivery models).The availability, accessibility, and general op-erating characteristics of nual C/MHCs, partic-ularly those in persistent poverty and frontierregions; special problems these centers face;whether theae centers are able to provide asufficient scope of care, particularly obstetricscare; and how critical they are as a source ofprimary care.Option 6: Expand funding to the Office of RuralHealth Policy to administer an extended clear-inghouse of information on innovations andsuccesses in rural health delivery.Many States and communities would like toinvestigate and implement improved forms of healthservice delivery but do not have, and are unable topurchase, the necessary knowledge and expertise.The Federal Government has a unique capability toact as a central point for information collection anddissemination. In addition, the Federal Governmenthas an interest in providing assistance relating toState and local implementation of current programsin order to enhance the effective use of Federalfunds.ORHP's current efforts to develop an informationclearinghouse could receive supplemental support to:contact researchers to develop extensive casestudies of various zural service delivery innova-tions;work closely with private groups fundinginnovative rural health delivery demonstrationprojects to document and disseminate informa-tion on project activities and fmdings; androutinely analyze information collected oninnovative strategies, identify those that appearto have the broadest benefit and tramferability,and identify factors that will affect their appli-cations in other areas.RURAL HEALTH PERSONNEL:ISSUES AND OPTIONSIssuesAvailability of Personnel\"PhysiciansPhysicians have historically beenthe cornerstone of the health care system, andphysician supply has been increasing for many yearsin both rural and urban areas (table 2) (33). Despitethe overall increase, however, rural areas have fewerthan one-half as many physicians providing patientcare as urban areas (91 v. 2.6 per 100,000 residentsin 1985) (table 2) (33).

Over 100 U.S. counties have no practicingphysicians at all(3 I).The availability of primary care physicians inniral areas is of particular concern. Primary carephysicians make up well over one-half of allphysicians who provide patient care in rural areas(table 3), but these areas are increasingly competingwith urban practices (such as those associated withhealth maintenance organizations) for primary carephysicians.

Their small numbers are increasing,although there appears to be a very gradual trendtoward specialization and urban practice even forthese practitioners. The distribution of midlevelpractitioners varies enormously by State; theseprofessionals are most likely to be found in Stateswithmidlevelpractitioner schools and in States thatpermit more independent practice.Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs)are another midlevel profession that is especiallyimportant to small rural hospitals that wish toprovide basic surgical services but cannot support orattract physician anesthetists. The national supply ofCRNAs, however, appears to be in decline. -125 Sununary and Options15 NiusesRural hospitals have markedly fewerregistered nurses (RNs) and lower ratios of RNs tolice:iced practical/vocational muses than do theirurban counterparts (32). The proportion of RNs whowork in nual areas has decreased in recent years, andrural areas will probably continue to be at adisadvantage when competing for the shrinkingnational supply of nurses.12 On average, nurses insmaller rural counties are considerably older thanother nurses and are less likely to have baccalaureatenursing degrees, making upgrading to midleveldegrees (e.g.. NP) more difficult.DentistsAs with physicians, the number ofdentists and the proportion of dentists enteringspecialty practice have increased considerably overthe past two decades. However, rural areas haveconsiderably fewer dentists per capita than urbanareas, and projected future shortages of dentists arelikely to worsen the situation (33,34). Despite thelarge number of dentists in general at the presenttime, there remains a small but constant demand fordentists in areas with chronic or occasional difficultyrecruiting these practitioners.PharmacistsThere has been no national censusof pharmacists since the 1970s, and the number ofpharmacists peacticing in rural areas is unknown.The national supply of pharmacists is projected toincrease (33). A handful of State studies suggest thaturban/rural differences in distribution are less severefor pharmacists than for many other health profes-sionals, but little is known about the existence oflocal areas of shortage.OptometristsOptometrists may be importantproviders of vision care in rural areas withoutophthalmologists. One-third of all optometrists (andone-fifth of ophthalmologists) were practicing incommunities of 25,4200 or fewer residents in 1983(3). As with pharmacists, the national supply ofoptometrists is increasing (33), although some localshortages may exist.Allied Health ProfessionalsThe allied healthprofessions include a wide variety of laboratorypersonnel, therapists, technologists, emergency per-sonnel, dental hygienists, and other professionals. Astudy by the institute of Medicine, which examined10 different allied health professions, predictedserious impending shortages in the national suppl-of physical and occupational therapists, radiolo.,icMx*, me*: Pew flownSome rural oxnnunlliss have edited access to baskdental aervIces.technologists, and medical records specialists (10).The available anecdotal evidence and small-areastudies suggest that some rural facilities are alreadysuffering critical shortages of physical and occupa-tional therapists and some radiologic and laboratorypersonnel.Barriers tO Rural PracticeBarriers to the availability and willingness ofhealth professionals to locate in rural areas interveneat two levels. First, because rural areas often havepopulations too sparse or dispersed to support manysubspecialty physicians, an inadequate supply ofprimary care physicians and midlevel practitionersis a barrier to the availability of health care servicesin rural areas even if there is an oversupply ofphysicians overall. Although the supply of physi-cians has grown dramatically in the past twodecades, most of the increase has been amongnonprimary care specialists. The backbone of therural health care system, however, is primary carephysiciansthose who can 1.rcvide a wide array ofbasic health possisolaric 126 M*IlealdiGmacRanakneri= Photo mat Peter SownSatellite dirks trot are staffed part-erne can be aAte' source al primary care services in num ruralcommunities.cannot support a full complement of specialists.Recent Federal policies have addressed this barrierby redesigning Medicare payment to enhance pay-ment for many ccimary care services. FurtherFederal options discussed below include supportingprimary care physician and midlevel educationdirectly or through changes in Medicare reimburse-ment for direct medical education.Second, within a given group of professionals(e.g., primary care physicians), personal concerns,perceived lower financial rewards, professionalisolation, and lack of preparation for rural practiceprevent many practitioners from locating and stay-ing in rural areas. Strategies to address thesebarriers and concerns through rural-oriented trainingprograms and direct financial incentives for ruralpractice have had some success in the past. Federalmeasures to address disincentives to rural practicehave been in place for two decades, but during the1980s their funding declined. Options for reinstatingFederal interventions include targeting funding tonual-oriented health professions programs and of-fering direct incentives to health professionalsthrough scholarships, educational loan repayment,and srecial payment or practice provisions thatapply to health professionals in underserved ruralareas. The Federal Government could also choose toenhance other resources available to rural practition-ers (e.g., technical assistance, continuing education, t)4lcag-distance consultation resources). Combinationsaf strategies, rather than any single strategy, arelikely to be the most effective in improving theavailability of health professionals in rural areas.Options for Congressional ActionInfluencing the Supply ofPrimary Care PhysiciansOption 8: Reorient or augment existing Federalfunding for graduate medical education todirect resources to Irimary care specialties(family practice, get eral internal medicine,general pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology).Option &4: Expand Federal grant funding forprimary care undergraduate and graduate medi-cal education.The Federal Government provides grants to fam-ily practice, general internal medicine, and generalpediatric residency programs, but these grants de-clined substantially between 1980 and 1988. Grantsfor the development, improvement, and rnainte-nance of undergraduate departments of family medi-cine have also decreased in recent ycars. Targetedfunding for primary care education is one strategyfor overcoming some of the disincentives for spe-cialty training in primary care.Option 88: Weight Medicare reimbursement fordirect medical education costs to give preferenceto primary care specialties.Medicare reimbursement to hospitals for directgraduate medical education expenses does notdistinguish among specialties. By altering the pay-ment formula to give greater weight, and thusprovide greater resources, to specified primary carespecialties, it may be possible to alter the mix ofphysician specialists without further increasing thetotal number of physicians. A difficulty in imple-menting this option would be that of developing anadequate rationale for the specific weights to beassigned to each specialty. An advantage, comparedwith option 8A, is that it could be adopted withoutincreasing overall kvels of funding.Enhancing Training and Preparationof Rural Health PersonnelOption 9: Within Federal grant programs forprimary care medical education, target fund-ing to rural-oriented programs. 127 Summary and Options17 Option 9A: Target a fixed percentage of graru fundsfor graduate medical education speccally toprograms that emphasize preparation for prac-tice in rural and underserved areas.lb be eligible for grants, programs could berequired to encourage rural/undersexved practice byincorporating into their curricula activities such asrequiring rotations for residents in rural practicesettings and providing enhanced training in mentalhealth. Alternatively, eligibility for residency pro-gram grants could be made contingent on outcomee.g., the demonstration that a requisite propordon ofgraduates were practicing in rural or underservedareas a year after graduation.Option 98: Target a percentage of grant fur.ds forundergraduate medical education speccally toprograms that emphasize preparation for pri-mary care practice and for practice in rural andunderserved areas.Students entering undergraduate medical edu-cation with an interest in primary care often switchto subspecialty preferences by graduaeon. Under-graduate exposure to primary care practice in ruralsettings has been shown to positively influence thechoi,:e for rural primary care practice. Federal grantfunds for undergraduate medical education could betargeta: to programs providing such opportunities.Funding could also be targeted to schools servingareas of greatest need (e.g., allopathic and osteo-pathic r.sedical schools in regions of low primarycare Vrysician supply), and funded programs couldbe tr.gets for National Health Service Corps scholar-sh:p awards.Option 10: Expand funding to training programsfor midlevel professionals, giving preference toprograms that emphasize preparation for ruralpractice.Midlevel professionals are vital components ofthe rural health care system, but they are relativelyfew in miter. Furthermore, the rise of IIMOs andthe expansion of other urban opportunities formidlevel professionals makes it more difficult forrural areas to recruit and retain these providers.Compared with funding for physician education,funding for midlevel training programs and continu-ing education it very limited. In 1988, only 11rural-focused NP programs and 1 rural-focusedCNM program were funded. Thirty-eight PA train-ing programs are currently supported, many ofwhich are required to develop and use methodsdesigned to encourage graduates to work in healthpersonnel shortage areas.Current grant programs to health professionsschools that train midlevel providers could beexpanded and directed towards those programs thatincorporate rural-oriented curricula, or that demon-strate sUCCCSS in placing graduates rural andunderservoi areas.Option 11: Provide grants and traineeships torural-oriented multiple competency trainingprograms for allied health professionals.The availability of trained allied health personnel,and particularly of personnel who can perform morethan one function, is becoming ihcreasingly impor-tant to the survival of small rural hospitals. Thesmall grant program currently authorized to fundmultidisciplinary training programs does not explic-itly include cross-training of allied health personnel.TO enhance the effectiveness of a cross-trainingprogram, continuation of funding could be contin-gent on an outcome requiremente.g., trainingprograms could be required to demonstrate that asub.rr2nri21 proportion of graduates were practicingin rural areas. The availability of traineeships mightalso enhance the effectiveness of a general program.by providing students from rural and underservedareas the financial incentive and capability to enrollin such a program.Option 12: Expand funding for rural AreaHealth Education Centers, with special em-phasis on training and continuing education ofnonphysician health professionals.The original AHEC concept was to developmul tidisciplinary educational experiences. AlthoughAHECs have become increasingly involved in suchactivities in recent years, .aost of their resourceshave been spent on physician education. AHECs area model for encouraging State and local participa-tion in activities addressing the geographic maldis-tribution of health professionals. The program isdesigned to crate lasting networks that wouldeventually be supported entirely through State andlocal funds. 'lb extend the usefulness of the AHECmodel and encourage more comprehensive servicedelivery systems, future AHEC startup grants couldbe directed to programs that emphasize the trainingand continuing education of midlevel providers,mental health providers, and other nonphysician 128 18Health Care in Rural America health professionals. AHEC \"special initiative\"funds could be targeted to existing AHECs for thesame purposes. The authority for AHECs could beexpanded to enable nursing schools to receiveAHEC funds directly.Offering Direct Incentives for Rural PracticeOption 13: Expand the National Health ServiceCorps (NHSC) by increasing funding for boththe State and Federal components of the NHSCLoan Repayment Program and by reinstatinga targeted Scholarship Program.In 1988, 29 percent of all rural residents wereliving in federally designated HMSAs (31). Thisnumber has not changed appreciably during the past5 years, indicating a need for ensuring the availabil-ity of health professionals who have at least ashort-term commitment to serving in these areas.Federal investment in the NHSC declined dramati-cally in the 1980s and is now embodied primarily inFederal- and State-administered loan repaymentprograms. The Federal Loan Repayment Programwas funded at $3.9 million in 1989 and that yearrecruited 112 professionals, mostly physicians. Atpresent, there are only seven State NHSC LoanRepayment programs.\"The Loan Repayment program provides an incen-tive to recently graduated practitioners that isparticularly appropriate for recruiting physiciansand dentists, fix three reasons. Fast, it does notrequire any commitments until the practitioner hasfmisbed his or her education, leading to lesslikelihood of default. Second, recipients are availa-ble almost immediately. Third, the level of indebted-ness among medical and dental students has in-creased dramatically in recent years, and the Peol ofinterested applicants to an expanded loan repaymentprogram is lately to be large.The State and Federal components of the loanrepayment program have cornpkmentary advantages.The State program efforts are more localized thanFederal efforts, and they attract providers who arewilling to serve but want the assurance that they cancarry out their service obligation within their Stateof residence. In addition the program requirementthat States match Federal funds encourages greaterState participation in health personnel distributionactivities.Maintaining the Federal program would ensurethat some obligated providers were available toserve in underserved areas in States without theirown loan programs, and it would attract providersinterested in new locations.Available data indicate that the original NHSCScholarship Program, while expensive, was highlysuccessful e placing providers in shortage areas. Arenewed scholarship program would be especiallyappropriate for midlevel providers. Their relativelylow educational costs (compared with those forphysicians) lead to correspondingly lower educa-tional indebtedness, maldng loan repayment a rela-tively weaker policy tool, while making a scholar-ship program less expensive for the Federal Govern-ment. Scholarships for other health professionsstudents could be targeted to those from low-income, minority, or rural backgrounds. Thesestudents are somewhat more likely than others topractice in underserved areas after graduation, andthey are less likely to be able to afford the economicburden of a health profession education.Other measures could also be taken within boththe Loan and Scholarship programs to enhance thecapabilities of obligated professionals and to in-crease the likelihood that they would remain aftertheir obligation expires. For example:Preference could be given to students who haveenrolled in a program with arural, primary-care-oriented curriculumParticipants could be permitted to serve theirobligations at a single site regardless of anychange in the area's designation status duringtheir period of obligation.The NHSC could actively coordinate with otherprograms (e.g., the AHEC program) to ensuresupport for scholarship recipients during theireducation and periods of obligation. Supportmight include such features as rural preceptor-ships, practice management training, technicalassistance, and continuing education.A renewed NHSC would be a major investment.If this option were implemented, the program wouldwarrant accompanying oversight (e.g., by the Gen-eral Accounting Office) in its first years to ensurethat funds were appropriately and efficiently admin-istero.

It would also increase incentives forphysicians less hiely to provide services to Medi-care beneficiaries (e.g., pediatricians, obstetrician/gynecologists). Medicaid bonuses might be espe-cially appropriate for physicians providing obstetricservices in areas with shortages of obstetricians.Option 15: Offer tax incentives to health provid-ers in specified rural and underserved areas.Direct and time-limited tax incentives for primarycare providers (physicians and midlevel profession-als) serving underserved populations might over-come perceived or real financial disincentives tolocating and practicing in rural areas. Tax incentivescould be offered to providers in all rural areas, butthis policy could be expensive without improvingavailability in the areas of greatest heed. If theseincentives are linked to federally designated short-age or underserved areas, however, their continua-tion should not be dependent on the continued statusof the designation (i.e., if the area is \"dedesignated\"during the term of the incentive, the incentive shouldnot be removed).Option 16: Allow andfacilities.For HMSAs with small populations, the additionof a single physician (or the retention of an NHSCphysician past his or her period of obligated service)can mean the loss of designated status. The suddenloss of resources dependent on continued designa-tion (e.g., Medicare physician bonus payments,placement of NI-ISC personnel, and qualification asa Rural Health Clinic under Medicare rules) mayproduce unintentional negative consequences.A \"grace period\" could encourage existingproviders to stay while permitting the FederalGovernment to direct new available parsonnel tomore needy areas. For example, if the addition of aprovider in a designated HMSA raises the provider-to-population ratio above the allowable limit and theHMSA is targeted for dedesignation during periodicreview, that HMSA could be placed on a provisionallist that received close monitoring. HMSAs on thelist might receive no new resources but couldcontinue existing resources linked to designation. Ifat the end of the 2-year period the ratio was stillabove the allowable limit, that HMSA could bededesignated. Such a policy could be limited toprimary care HMSAs or applied to all types ofHMSAs.Option 17: Authorize and implement a Staterural health personnel grant.A drawback to all rural health personnel programsoperated from the Federal level is the inability toadapt strategies to local concerns and conditions. AState with a school to train physician assistants, forexample, may most effectively address health per-sonnel shortage problems by enhancing this school'scurricula and providing scholarships to its studems.In another Statc, absolute health personnel shortagesmight be less a problem than the provision ofspecific services, such as obstetrics; such a Statemight fmd that paying malpractice premiums forrural obstetrics providers was a more effectivestrategy than diroct recruitment of more physiciansto rural areas. A broadly defined grant to Stateswould transfer responsibility to the individual Statesto decide how they choose to allocate the fundsamong health professions programs and direct in-centive programs to enhance the supply of healthprofessionals in rural areas. Such a grant could eitheraugment existing Federal programs or replace someof them.Under a rural health personnel grant program,States could be allocated grant funds based on aformula developed by DHHS (e.g., percentage ofpopulation that is rural; number-arural residentsliving in underserved or personnel shortage areas).Within the grant, States could spend funds on any ofa list of relevant specified activities Vaal as:grants to State health professions schools withrural-oriented curricula;Medicaid payment incentives for services pro-vided in underserved areas;Medicaid bonus payments for \"dispropor-tionate share\" providers (those with unusuallyhigh caseloads of Medicaid and uninsuredpatients);scholarship and loan programs;other recruitment mechanisms (e.g., placementservices, State tax incentives);puichase of malpractice insurance premiumsfor rural obstetrics providers (obstetricians, 4r 130 20Health Care in Raral America NPs);innovative continuing education programs forrural professicaals: anddevelopment of appropriate curricula and es-tablishment of community training programs(e.g., in local hospitals and community col-leges) for rural residents interested in one of theallied health professions, and for current alliedhealth personnel wishing to extend their ac-creditation to more than one area.The expertise among State governments regardingthe administration of rural health programs variesconsiderably. Some States are capable of designingand administering a detailed array of incentive andgrant programs, while others have much morelimited capability at present. As a prerequisite toreceiving funds under such a grant, StateS could berequired to provide a plan outlining the activities tobe funded and indicating that the State has anadequate administrative capability (e.g., an Office ofRural Health or analogous body) to carry out thefunding activities. In addition, States could herequired to provide the Federal Government withbasic information on the programs actually fundedover the preceding year as a prerequisite for renew-ing the grant. This information would not onlyenable some oversight of expenditures but wouldprovide the basis for the Federal Government tosssist in information transfer among States regard-ing innovative programs.Removing Barriers to Midlevel PracticeOption 18: Require States to reimburse underMedicaid for the services of NPs and PAs inrural areas, as long as these services arepermitted by State practice acts.Current Federal policy requires States to reim-burse under Medicaid for services provided bypediatric and family NPs (Public Law 101-269). Italso allows States to exercise the option of reimburs-ing for other NP and PA services, and nearlyone-half of all States now do so to some degree. TheFederal policy requiring States to provide Medicaidreimbursement for CNM services provides a prece-dent for a more general policy. As with CNMs,Federal policy could prevent State Medicaid pro-grams from requiring the direct personal supervisionof a physician during the delivery of NP and PAservices. Restricting the requirement to rural areasmight provide an additional incentive for NPs andPAs to locate in these areas, while a lxoader policy 4 CI-1.stmight encourage their expanded use in urban as wellas rural settings.This option carries weight only where State lawspermit midlevel practitioners to operate under off-site supervision. The Federal Government has tradi-tionally not dictated the scope of practice that Statespermit of their licensed health professionals. (Option19 addresses a potartial Federal role in the reexami-nation of State licensure restrictions.)Option 19. Encourage DHHS to sponsor a confer-ence to discuss models and guidelines for Statenurse and medical practice act revision thatwould enhance the capabilities of midlevelpractitioners to provide primary health care inrural and underserved areas.Midlevel practitioners can provide a limitednumber of basic health services in areas not ade-quately served by physicians. Their ability to do so,however, is legally restricted in many States, partic-ularly for PM. A conference, sponsored by DIMS,would give representatives from different parts ofthe government and health care an opportunity toreevaluate the suitability of existing limits to midlevelpractice. Participants might include experts from themedical, PA, and advanced nursing professions,representatives from State and Federal agencies, andrepresentatives from other sectors of the health careindustry. Guidelines developed by such a panelcould help States evaluate and implement appropri-ate changes to their own regulations.Improving the Information BaseOption 20: Improve monitoring of the MedicarePhysician Bonus Payment Program to find outhow well it works.The Medicare physician bonus program wasrecently expanded to provide a 10-percent bonus fa;all physician services in all primary care HMSAs, inorder to increase access to services for Medicsrebeneficiaries. It is not clear whether a 10-percentbonus on Medicare payment is sufficient to attractphysicians to areas where they would otbawise not.choose to locate, or whether it improves the retentionof providers already in these areas. The Medicarecaseload varies greatly from physician to physician,and the strength of the bonus incentive probablyvaries accordingly. lb improve OFEHS's ability toevaluate the program, carriers could be required tosubmit to the Health Care Financing Administrationdata regarding the number of physicians receiving 131 Summary and Options21 bonus payments and the distribution of services forwhich bonus payments are made.Option 21: Establish a program, through theBureau of Health Professions, to provide smallgrants and technical assistance to States andprofessional associations to establish and im-plement uniform data collection proceduresamong the health professions.Better data on the supply and distribution ofhealth professionals would improve the FederalGovernment's ability to monitor trends in theavailability of th-ae personml in mral areas. Mostprofessional associations collect data on the mem-bers of their profession, but these efforts aresometimes very limited, and the data are notcompatible. States likewise collect data on licensedhealth professionals, and they may include someprofessionals not represented in professional associ-ation databases. 'lb enhance these efforts with aminimum amount of Federal resources, the Bureauof Health Professions in the Health Resources andServices Administration could establish criteria foruniform data collection. The Bureau could thenprovide States and associations with technical assis-tanceon survey sample selection methods or oncensus collection methods, make available startupfunds, and offer other appropriate assistance (e.g.,for hardware, software, and other resources).TWO SPECIFIC SERVICESIssues and Options in Maternal andInfant Care\"Fetal, infant, and maternal mortality are alldisproportionately high in rural areas (27,28).15These indicators of relatively poor rural maternaland infantheahhpasistdespiteprivate andgovernment-funded programs that have successfully reducedinfant mortality in targeted areas. Two potentialcontributors to the relatively poorer health of ruralmothers and Wants are the limited availability ofobstetric providers and access to specialized carefor women with difficult pregnancies and deliveries.The availability of rural obstetric providers hasdeclined sharply in recent years, and over 500,000residents of rural countiesmany of them in theSouthare without any physicians who provideobstetric care. In many rt:.11 areas, physicianstrained to provide obstetric services are not doing so.Unwillingness is often due to concerns about inade-quate sources of backup, consultation, and referralthat are shared by rural physicians in all specialties.In addidon, however, many physicians are limitingor eliminating their obstetric practices as a directconsequence of the high cost of malpractice insur-ance and fears of lawsuits. These trends are particu-larly disturbing in rural areas because alternativesources of obstetric care may be a considerabledistance away.Where them are obstetric providers, they areusually general and family practitioners rather thanobstetricians. And although rural hospitals are muchmore likely than urban hospitals to offer obstetriccare, they are much less likely to offer specializedcare. Consequently, rural women with complicatedor high-risk pregnancies may have to travel consid-erable distances to reoeive specialized Care. Region-alized perinatal care, successfully promoted in thepast by Federal programs, can enhance access tospecialty services when obstetric or neonatal emer-gencies arise, but regionalized systems of care havedeteriorated over the past several years.In some rural areas, women who are ableparticularly those with higher incomes and privateinsurance coverageare bypassing local facilitiesto deliver in distant hospitals offering sophisticatedservices. One result may be to leave local physiciansand hospitals with an increasingly higher proportionof patients who cannot pay the full costs of their care.Rural physicians under these circumstances mayfmd itparticularly difficult to afford obstetricliability insurance, possibly prompting them toreduce their obstetric practices and further in-creasing the burden on remaining obstetric provid-ers.Federal maternal and infant health programs (e.g.,Medicaid, the Maternal and Child Health blockgrant, and C/MHC funds) are especially important inrural areas, where the inability to pay for obstetricservices is a serious problem. In 1982, rural deliver-ies accounted for nearly one-half of all uncompen-sated deliveries. C/MHCs are particularly important \"See alio option 5 peacoat options gmerally (Vice. 7 thmagh 72).\"Thii finding hot& aye sew adUnring for race mat am Undjaned nand infant mortality num are actually Iowa than urban rum beanie of thegreater prevalahce of whin Woad in anal now 132 in Rural America Photo awe 77m HonderesonMany NM community health centers eltract a largecroweeceon and may be vitalIMMO CI Wail obelelde ogre.sources of prenatal care for many rural women,because they accept all Medicaid patients andprovide discounted care for low-income uninsuredpatients. But the expense of malpractice insurancehas reduced the ability of some federally supportedCIMHCs to provide obstetric care (11). Ensuringsurvival of essential rural C/MHCs (and their abilityto provide obstetric services) is as important tomaternal and infant health as ensuring survival ofessential nrral hospitals.Option 22: Extend liability coverage under theFederal Tort Claims Act to C/MHC staff andcontract providers engaged in obstetric care.The Federal Tbrt Claims Act currently insuresboth commissioned officers of the NHSC and NHSCscholarship paduates who work as civilian employ-ees of the Public Health Service. Many C/MHCobstetric providers placed through the NHSC, how-ever, have DO federally provided insurance coveragebecause they are paid through the center. Providinginsurance coverage might increase the willingnessof obstetric providers to join C/MHC staffs, toremain at these locations, and to continue to providea full range of obstetric services to C/MHC patients.Option 23: Enhance the information base forFederal rural maternal and infant hea: th Option 23A: Investigate in more depth the urban andrural differences in perinatal health status indi-cators.Whether the excess of rural fetal deaths is real oroccurs because of differential reporting in rural andurban areas is unclear and deserves further investiga-tion. 'The underlying cause of the excess mortality inlate infancy likewise deserves to be investigated.Clarification of perinatal health status in rural areaswould be useful in targeting programs. Programs toimprove care for pregnant women might curb excessfetal deaths, while improved pediatric care couldpotentially reduce high mortality rates among olderinfants. Congress could direct the National Centerfor Health Statistics or the Agency for Health CarePolicy and Research to investigate these issues.Option 238: Develop a database that would allowFederal policymakers to target resources toStates and to their rural areas with perinatalhealth problems.A number of programs have shown success inimproving access to prenatal care in the past.I6 TheFederal Government could build on their success bytargeting resources for such programs to areas withhigh-risk populations, high perinatal mortality, anda high proportion of women seeking late or noprenatal care. Such areas could be identified in partwith information available on vital records (e.g.,birth certificates). The National Center for HealthStatistics, in the Centers for Disease Control, couldundertake this activity.Option 24: Enhance the EIHHS Office of Mater-nal and Child Health's (MCH's) ability toprovide useful information and technical sup-port to rural maternal and infant care efforts.Option 24A: Enable and encourage MCH to supportadditional demonstration projects in rural areas.Funded projects could evaluate the feasibility ofinnovative approaches to improving access toperinatal services in rural areas.Demonstration projects funded through MCHcould be used, for example, to compare the relativecost and effectiveness of bringing providers intoisolated rural areas with providing transportationservices to the patients themselves. Among thecurrent MCH-f mded rural projects is an evaluationof the uae of an outreach consultation team ofpermatal specialists to visit rural health districts MCorapammissoccessfal w. mid emaeportaace. 1'Th 133 Summary and Options23 (37). Demonstration project funding could be ex-panded to include more model projects that:employ noaphysician providers as rural out-reach workers,promote regional approaches to solve accessproblems,promote linkages of available perinatal re-sources. andincorporate home visits by nurses or para-professionals.Pmjects could be required not only to evaluate theeffectiveness but the costs of these models.Option 24B: Provide additional funds (or earmarka proportion offuture funds) to better allow MCHto offer technical assistance on request to Statesthat are developing regionalized perinatal careservices that include rural areas.A perinatal care network is an essential compo-nent of a functional network of comprehensivehealth care services to rural residents. Resourcesfrom various Federal sources are available to helpStates develop regional and local networks andservices. Greater availability of technical assistancefrom MCH might help States and communities useboth Federal and local funds most effectively.Issues and Options in Mental Health Care\"The prevalence of mental disorders in ruralAmericans is similar to that of their urban counter-parts. Despite the similarity in mental health prob-lems, the little information that exists suggests thatrural areas have substantially fewer mental healthresources than urban aseas. Furthermore, whereresources exist, they are blely to be narrower inscope.As with otha health facilities, mental healthfacilities face prcblems in serving populationsspread over vast distances. In addition, they arecaught between competing needs for services for thechronically mentally ill and services for acute andless serious conditions. Because recent Federal andState policies have tended to emphasize the former,the ability of many rural mental health providers tooffer services such as suicide prevention, education,aisis intervention, support groups, and individualcounseling for less severe mental health problemshas waned. Furthermore, other sources of areas.(e.g., from nonprofit foundations) are less availableto fill the vacuum in rural than in urban areas.Rural mental health professionals face problemssimilar to those of other rural health professionals.They have fewer training opportunities, fewer col-leagues with whom to consult and to discussprofessional issues, and more diverse demands ontheir time than do their urban counterparts. Primarycare physicians provide much of the mental healthcare in both urban and rural areas, but they receiverelatively little training in mental health diagnosisand treatment. Master's level mental health profes-sionals, paraprofessionals, allied professionals (e.g.,the clergy), and volunteers are also vital providers ofrural health services.The severe shortage of psychiatrists and doctoral-level psychologists in rural areas, the proportion ofmental health care provided by nonpsychianicphysicians, and the types of services likely to bemost acceptable to rural residents all suggest thatintegrating mental health and other health care isespecially important in rural areas. Social workers,psychologists, clinical psychiatric nurse specialists,and paraprofessionals play an important role inextending rural mental health services to those in \"See OW OptIOn 12. 134 24Health Care in Rural orate: FYN, &moonStaffing volgailaers fe nral anus.need, and in linking these services with physicalhealth services. These linkages rnay include suchfeatures as health and mental health clinics sharinga single service site, routine consultation betweenphysicians and mer 'al health center staff, or afull-time social worker providing counseling andeducational services in a community health clinic orphysician's office. Recent legislation has expandedthe reimbursement available for certain \"linkage\"services, namely the mental health services providedby clinical social workers and psychologists incommunity health centers. Federal stimulation oflinkage efforts themselves, however, has declinedsince the implementation of the mental health blockgrant in 1981.Option 25: Provide grants to mental healthprofessions training programs that includerural-oriented curricula andfor train pro-fessionals most likely to locate in rural areas.For example, the provisions of Public Law100-607, which provided speCill project grants toprofessional schools' training programs for clinicalpsychologists, could be extended to include masters'programs for social workers and clinical psychiatricnurse specialists. Or, grants under this law could betargeted or limited to projects emphasizing trainingfor nual practice.Option 26: Require States to reimburse underMedicaid for mental health services providedby midlevel mental health professionals to theextent that these services are permitted underState licensure law. Reimbursement could belimited to those services that were provided inHMSAs or MUAs and would be covered ifprovided by a physician.In rural communities without psychiatrists ordoctoral psychologists, primaty mental health care isprovided by either nonpsychiatric physicians or bymidlevel mental health professionals (master's levelclinical psychologists, clinical social workers, andclinical psychiatric nurse specialists). Current Fed-eral policy covers reimbursement for the services ofpsychologists and social workers only in certifiedRHCs. Expanding the services for which midlevelmental health providers or their employers canreceive reimbursement would probably inaeaseaccess to these services in rural areas.Option 27: Encourage the development of link-ages between rural health and mental healthservices and professionals.Greater enhancement of linkages might includemeasures to encourage case management, sharebuilding space, develop referral patterns, and makebetter informed decisions about patient care. \"Link-age workers\" could be expanded to include master'slevel nurse specialists. Federal initiatives of thiskind are currently underway for health and substanceabuse treatment, but a more permanent and consis-tent policy of linkages for substance abuse, mentalhealth, and other health services could be adopted.Specific Federal strategies could include:reimbursement for linkage workers' services(e.g., social workers' services provided inphysicians' offices, including consultative serv-ices provided to the physician);funding for the salaries of clinical socialworkers and other mental health providers ingrants to federally ftmded C/MHCs;funding for inaervice training, internships, andshared training sites; andrequiring States to demonstrate that a portion ofFederal mental health block grant funds isbeing used to support linkage efforts in ruralwas as a prerequisite to continued block grantfunding. 135 Summary and Options25 Option 28: Invest more resources in data collec-tion and analysis activity oriented at urba n-rural comparisons of mental health and sub-stance abuse epidemiology, and at the availa-bility of mental health services and personnelin rural areas.The information available on nual mental healthepidemiology and services is extremely thin andprovides a poor basis for both monitoring mentalhealth status and implementing Federal policies.Even the most basic national data on communitynamtal beahh centers have been virtually nonexist-ent since 1981, and there are few reliable studies onmental health problems in rural areas. Congresscould direct the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and MentalHealth Administration (ADAMHA) to place moreemphasis on these research activities (e.g., throughthe National Institute of Mental Health's recentlycreated Office of Rural Mental Health).Option 29: Encourage or require ADAMHA tofund projects intended to demonstrate theutilization of volunteers and paraprofessionalsin service delivery.One way to help address mental health personnelshortages is Jo include paraprofessionals and com-munity volunteers in service delivery. However,little is known about effective ways to increase theuse of these providers, their acceptance in thecommunity, and the effectiveness of the servicesthey provide. Incentives to be tested in the demon-stration projects could include training programs forparaprofessionals and clergy, reimbursement forprofessional activities to develop and train commu-nity workers, and educational support for commu-nity workers in the form of tuition for collegetraining.REFERENCES\"I.

KYMotherswhoreceiveinadequateprenatal care are more likely to have low birthweight infants (referring to infants bornweighing less than 5.5 pounds) than women who receive continuous prenatal care which beginsearly in their pregnancies. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about 75percent of the babizs bczn in this country are born to mothers who received prenatal care thatbegan in the firct 3 months of pregnancy. This proportion has been relatively stable since1979.Low bitthweight is a leading contributor to poor pregnancy outcomes including infant deathand disability in infants who survive. About 7 percent of all infants born in the U.S. are of lowbirthweight. Several studies have shown that the cost of prenatal care is considerably lessthan the cost of caring forlow birthweight infant. The Health Insurance Association ofAmerica reported that the average daily cost of care in a neonatal intensive care unit was $985in 1989. In 1985, the Office of Technology Assessment estimated that $14,000 to $30,000 couldbe saved for every low birthweight birth averted.The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that young children bevaccinated against 8 diseases between ages 2 months and 2 years. Among children enteringschool or enrolled in licensed child care centers, 95 percent or more are fully immunized.Estimated immunization rates drop to 70 percent for children under age 2 and may be under .2-=:=1. CRS Reports are prepared for Mem ben: and commatte of 4 ono,,,, CRS 139 CRS-2 50 percent among minority preschoolers residing in urban areas. After reaching a record lowof 1,497 reported cases in 1983, the incidence of measles increased sharply in the U.S. to 25,000reported cases in 1990 when measles accounted for 61 deaths. Cases of mumps and whoopingcough reported in 1990 exceeded the numbers reported for theee diseases in 1983.Some experts cite financial and organizational barriers to access to immunization services.Since 1982, the cost of a full childhood immunization series in public clinic has increasedfrom about Ell to over $90 per child. Public health officials do not have registries or trackingsystems with which to monitor whether a child has received the recommended immunizations.Federal projects that address childhood immunization rates include subsidized purchase ofvaccines and funded demonstration projects for improving vaccine coverage levels amongpreschool children.Children who have a regular source of health care are more likely to receive primary andpreventive health care as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Throughregular medical visits, some problems can be detected and treated early and some complicationsof illness can be prevented. Health insurance coverage is an important factor in access toregular care. In 1990, 83 million children, 13 percent of all children under age 18, accountedfor nearly one-fourth of this country's uninsured population. The 1988 National HealthInterview Survey on Child Health showed that children in families with health insurancecoverage and higher incomes are more likely to have regular source of care than uninsuredand poor children. The survey also showed that poor children are more likely to receiveroutine care in hospital or community clinics that in physicians' offices. The difference insource of care may reflect the relative shortage of physicians in inner city and some ruralareas.Numerous Federal grant programs help State, local and private nonprofit agencies toprovide health care for children. The largest of these are Medicaid, the joint Federal/Stateprogram authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act; nutrition programs under theChild Nutrition Act of 1966; the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant programauthorized under title V of the Social Security Act; and the health centers that receive grantsunder the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The PHSA also includes programs for leadpoisoning prevention. The Administration's Healthy Start initiative funds projects to reduceinfant mortality in 15 communities. A refundable tax credit helps low-income familiespurchase health insurance coverage for their children. Many other federally funded programsand demonstration projects provide services for improving children's health. Eligibility forsome programs is restricted to low-income persons and families. Programs that do not havethis explicit restriction may reach large numbers of low income children because they aredirected to low-income communities or other areas in which access is limited. For manyprograms there is coordination at State and local levels for eligibility determination andreferral to necessary services.

Mental disorders can strike cruelly, producing hallucinations,paranoia, depression, panic, and obsessions. Some people with serious mentalillnesses (SMD experience moderate problems of recent origin that never recur.Others have severe problems that continue over a long period of time.

Whateverapproach is pursued is likely to have signif-icant effects on individuals, businesses,government, and providers and suppliers ofhealth care, making agreement on any oneor a combination of legislative proposalsdifficult.Generally, the uninsured are young(under age 24); they are poor; and theyhave ties to the work force (primarily insmall firms, in industries with seasonal ortemporary employment, and in firms with alower skilled or less unionized work force).There is evidence that the uninsured popu-lation grew in the last decade. Insurancestatus has implications for access to healthservices: the uninsured use fewer healthcare services and have poorer health statusthan the insured.Proposals likely to be considered in the103rd Congress incorporate widely differentapproaches to expanding access to healthinsurance, including providing tax incen-tives to provide coverage privately; mandat-ing employers to extend health insurancebenefits to uncovered or underinsuredgroups; and instituting a national healthinsurance system.President Clinton en-dorsed an employer-based approach duringthe 1992 campaign. He has appointed atask force that is scheduled to develop ahealth care reform proposal by May 1993.One factor that may complicate a rolu-tion to access problems is the rising cost ofhealth care. Over the past 10 years, healthcare spending has grown faster than spend-ing in the general economy. Many believethat without major changes, the trend inspending will continue. The numbers ofuninsured and underinsured individualscould increase as rising health care costsmake it more expensive for individuals andemployers to purchase coverage. Any at-tempt to expand access to health insurancemay therefore need to address the factorsfueling health care inflation. Proposals tocontrol health care costs are incorporated inmany access proposals and reflect variedstrategies such as administrative reform,encouragement of managed care, and na-tional expenditure limits enforced throughcontrols on provider prices or insurers'premium rates or both.

Others received coveragethrough public programs such as Medicare (11%) or Medicaid (8%) and 9% received coveragefrom individually purchased policies, CHAMPUS or other sources.An estimated 35.4 million Americans (14%) were without any form of health insurancecoverage in 1991. Nearly all the uninsured are under 65, with the greatest concentrationamong children and young adults. The following discussion examines the characteristics of theuninsured, some possible explanations for recent declines in coverage, and the impact of lackof coverage on access to care. (For further information on the uninsured, see CRS Report 92-432 EPW, Health Insurance Coveruge: Characteristics of the Insured and UninsuredPopulations in 199(1)Characteristics of the UninsuredAge. Because most senior citizens have Medicare or other retirement health benefits,nearly all the uninsured are under 65, with the greatest concentration among children andyoung adults. Of than under 18, 13% are without coverage; children make up nearly one-quarter of the total uninsured population. However, the rate of uninsurance peaks in the 18-24 age group; 27% of young adults are without coverage. The uninsured in this age group areoften too old to be covered as dependents on their parents' policies. Those in poor families areno longer counted as part of their parents' household and may therefore be ineligible forMedicaid. Those working may be in entry-level jobs that do not provide coverage. Some of theyounger uninsured may also fail to obtain insurance that is available to them, because they donot foresee the need for medical care. The rate of uninsurance declines steadily from ar: 25on, chiefly because older workers are more likely to obtain coverage through their ownemployment.Employment Status. Of Americans with health insurance, 68% receive coveragethrough their own employment or that of another family member. Among the uninsured in1991, 84% had at least some ties to the work force. Nearly half were full-time workers or thedependenta of such workers, but failed to obtain employment-based coverage. The uninsuredare concentrated in small firms, especially those with fewer than 25 employees, in industries 1i.CRS-1 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 147 1B91093 02-11-93 characterized by seasonal or temporary employment, and in those with a lower skilled or lessunionized work force.The industries with the lowest rates of coverage are agriculture,personal services, entertainment and recreation, and retail trade.Income. The uninsured are disproportionately poor. In 1991, 29% of the uninsuredhad family incomes below 100% of the Federal poverty thresholds, and another 12% hadincomes between 100% and 133% of the poverty line. Medicaid is the major source of coveragefor the low-income population. However, the maximum allowable income under Medicaid formost types of persons is below the poverty line. Also, Medicaid has 'categorical' limits: somepersons, such u single adults and childless couples who are neither aged nor disabled, cannotqualify regardless of income. As a result,'Medicaid covered only 47% of persons in poverty in1991.Trends in Insurance CoverageChanges in the uninsured population over time are difficult to measure because ofchanges in standard surveys and other data problems. However, there is evidence that theproportion of the population that is uninsured rose during the early and mid-1980s. Growthin the uninsured may have occurred for several reasons. First, although the proportion of thepopulation in the work force has been growing, the percent receiving health benefits has beendropping. Some analysts attribute this trend to shifts in employment. Many of the new jobscreated in the last decade have been in the service and other nonmanufacturing industries, thesectors least likely to provide coverage. However, this factor accounts for only a small part ofthe growth in the uninsured.Second, the proportion of the population receiving coverage through another familymember's employment has been dropping. Several factors have contributed to this decline.As coverage of primary workers has dropped, so too has coverage of their dependents. Also,growing numbers of workers appear to be electing coverage for themselves but not for theirdependents. In 1990, workers who were themselves covered through employment failed tocover their spouses in about 6% of the cases; about 8% of the children of insured workers didnot receive employment-based coverage. In 1980, wholly employer-paid coverage for individualswas available to 72% of employees in medium- and large-size firms, and fully paid familycoverage to 51% of employeem. By 1991, wholly-paid individual coverage was available to 45%of workers, and wholly-paid family coverage to 23%. Changes have also occurred in familystructure; there are more households with older children or unrelated individuals. Such familyunits are less likely to meet the definitions in insurance coverage rules.Third, coverage from nonemployment sources declined, particularly Medicaid coverage.Welfare and Medicaid eligibility standards failed to keep pace with inflation; while the absolutenumber of people in poverty Was rising, the number of people receiving Medicaid stayedrelatively flat for a decade. Recent changes in the Medicaid program, such as initiatives tocover more pregnant women and children, appear to have reversed this trend. However, thefull impact of these changes is not yet known.Implications for AccessInsurance status has implications for access to health services. The uninsured usefewer health care services and have poorer health status than the insured population. Theuninsured are more likely to delay seeking care; when they finally seek care, the ailment maybe more serious and costly to treat. The uninsured also rely more on emergency rooms for basic services. CRS-2 148 IB91093 02-11-93 While the uninsured use comparatively fewer services, they nevertheless generally doreceive health care. Some of the uninsured pay for these services out-of-pocket; some receivecare from clinics and facilities that receive public subsidies; and some get it from providers whoare subsidizing the care through increased charges to their paying customers. For example,hospitals recorded about ;12.1 billion in free care and bad debt for 1990. Much of thatuncompensated care was financed by increased charges to patients with insurance.A problem facing the uninsured is that the sources of subsidized care may bedwindling.Increasing pressures on hospitals to negotiate rates and new methods ofreimbursement are making it difficult for hospitals to make up their uncompensated care costsby raising their charges to insurers or other third-party payers. Hospitals' reduced profitmargins and constraints on public funding are also limiting the dollars to financeuncompensated care. If these trends continue, the access problems of the uninsured could growmore severe. The problem may be exacerbated by uncontrolled growth in health care costs.It is relatively easy to provide care when it is inexpensive, but harder to do so when that carebecomes a major cost.Policy Options for the UninsuredAs noted earlier, while most Members of Congress agree that improving access tohealth insurance is a problem, there appears to be no consensus on what, if anything, to doabout the problem at the Federal level. Some in Congress, for example, want to take varioussteps toward improving health insurance coverage through tax incentives for small businesses,reform of the private health insurance market, and/or coverage of targeted populations, suchaa infants and pregnant women. Others believe that the only way to address the problems ofhealth care access and escalating costs is by enacting comprehensive reform, including aprogram providing universal health insurance and significant controls on health care costs.Any significant legislation that is enacted is likely to have significant effects on individuals,businesses, government, and providers and suppliers of health care, making agreement on anyone or even combination of leeslative proposals difficult.Over 100 health care reform proposals were introduced in the 102nd Congress. Theyincorporated widely different approaches to expanding access to health insurance, includingexpanding health insurance coverage through Medicaid; providing tax incentives to providecoverage privately; mandating employers to extend health insurance benefits to uncovered orunderinsured groups; and instituting a national health insurance system. Only onecomprehensive proposal received committee action. This was the HealthAmerica bill (S. 1227)introduced by Senator Mitchell and based largely on the 1990 recommendations of the U.S.Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care (\"the Pepper Commission\"). S. 1227provided for universal health insurance coverage accomplizhed through a phased-inrequirement on employers to provide or pay for health insurance (the so-called \"play-or-pay'approach) and the creation of a public program to cover those not insured through theworkplace. An amended version of this bill was ordered reported by the Senate Committee onLabor and Human Resources.More limited, incremental proposals made somewhat greater progress. SenatorBentsen's proposal to regulate insurance underwriting and rating practices iii the sthall groupmarket (S. 18721 was included, with mbaifiCations, in the Senate amendment to H.R. 4210, theTax Fairness and Economic Growth Act of 1992, and again in the Senate amendment to H.R.11, the Revenue Act of 1992. However, the health insurance provisions were dropped inconference on both bills. The Health Subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways andMeans ordered reported H. 5502 (Representative Stark), which includes regulation of insurers CRS-3 149 1B91093 02-11-93 and a significant expansion of Medicaid coverage. The bill also established a national healthbudget and a Federal system for setting the rates to be paid to medical care providers by allinsurers and other payers. It has been reintroduced, ith modifications, as all 200 in the 103rd Congress.President Clinton has appointed an interdepartmental task force that is scheduled todevelop a health care reform proposal by May 1993. The plan offered by the President duringthe 1992 campaign would require that all employers provide health insurance coverage; someform of financial assistance would be available to small firms as. well as to uninsuredindividuals without employment ties. The plan would use a managed competition approach,under which individuals and small groups would obtain coverage through purchasingcooperatives, along with some form of spending limits. It is not yet certain whether the taskforce's proposal will retain the basic outlines of this plan.The remainder of this section focuses on the major options considered by the 102ndCongreu and likely to be reintroduced in the 103rd Congress, including both comprehensiveproposals and more limited approaches.Universal Public CoverageThe most sweeping health insurance reform proposals would replace some or allexisting public and private coverage with a comprehensive public program. These proposalstake a number of different forms. \"Single payer* plans would enroll all U.S. residents (orsometimes all but those receiving Medicare) in a single publicly funded program, replacing themultiple payers of the current system. Some proposals would establish such a program at theFederal level, while others would create State-administered programs with Federal funding.(Under some proposals, all insurance would be publicly funded, but States could give theirresidents a choice among private contracting plans.) \"Medicare for all\" proposals wouldextend the current Medicare program for the aged and disabled to cover the entire population.The major difference between this approach and the single-payer option is that Medicarebenefits are less comprehensive than those included in the single-payer bills. This means thatthere would still be a role for private insurance in selling supplemental policies; in addition,Medicaid would still be needed to furnish supplemental coverage for the poor. A thirduniversal coverage modela national health service like the British National Health Servicein which the Government both finances and furnishes health care services - ;las also beenproposed.A number of States (among them Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon,and Vermont) are implementing or considering their own universal coverage plans. Someproposals would change Federal law to facilitate State action. Current Federal spending onMedicare and Medicaid for State residents could be turned over for use in the State's ownsystem. In addition, States could be permitted to regulate self-insured employer health plans(such regulation is currently preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of1974, ERISA). Legislation could provide an open-ended authority for State systems or couldcreate limited demonstrations.Employer-Based PlansMany proposals, instead of establishing universal coverage through a public program,would build on the current system, under which most people obtain health insurance throughemployment Under this approach, employers would be expected to furnish or help pay forcoverage for their workers and dependents; most proposals also include expansion of Medicaidor a new public program for persons not obtaining coverage through employers. Under play CRS-4 f-NII4.}1, 150 11391093 02-11-93 or pay proposals, employers would provide coverage or contribute a fixed percentage of payrolltowards the coot of covering their workers in a public plan. This was the approachrecommended by the Pepper Commission. In the 102nd Congress, the Senate Labor andHuman RA:sources Committee ordered reported an amended version of S. 1227, SenatorMitchell's play or pay proposal. One bill in the 103rd Congress, H.R. 727 (Matsui) would useplay or pay approach to cover pregnant women and children only).Other propceals would mandate that employers furnish coverage, without providingthe alternative of a payroll tax.. This was the approach suggested by President Clinton duringthe 1992 campaign; some form of targeted assistance would have been available for employerswho could not afford to provide coverage. Another option would simply require that employersoffer coverage: that is, make a group plan available to their employees but not contribute tothe premiums. In the 103rd Congress, this approach is included in H.R. 30 (Grandy); it is alsoa part of the Conaervative Democratic Forum proposal introduced by Representative Cooperin the 102nd Congress.Market ReformSome individuals or employers may wish to purchase insurance coverage but find itunaffordable or unavailable because of characteristics of the private insurance market or otherfactors. The final set of options would peek to make coverage more accessible or affordable.These include the following.Regulation of insurance underwriting practices, under which purchasers expectedto incur high medical costs may be refused coverage, receive coverage subject toexclusion of payment for 'preexisting conditions,\" or be charged higher rates thanother applicants. Numerous proposals in the 103rd Congress would modify ratingand underwriting practices of health insurers. These include H.R. 30, H.R. 101,H.R. 150, H.R. 191, RR. 196, H.R. 200, H.R. 727, and S. 18.Promotion of group purchasing arrangements, under which small employerswould join together to buy insurance, potentially increasing their bargainingpower and achieving economies of scale in plan administration. This approach isincluded in such bills as H.R. 101, H.R. 196, H.R. 200, S. 18, and S. 223. Some\"managed competition' proposals (see below) would require, rather than simplyencourage, small employers to obtain coverage through State-established healthinsurance purchasing cooperatives (H1PCs), which would seek to contract withcost-effective ineurance plans.Federal preemption of State mandated benefit laws. These laws, which requireinsurance policies to include specific types of coverage regardless of whether thepurchaser desires the coverage, are alleged to increase the price of ineurance.Overrides are included in most universal coverage proposals, which would replaceState mandates with a Federal minimum benefit; partial overrides are alsoincluded in the insurance regulation proposals.Encouraging States or private insurers to develop \"reinsurance\" poolingmechanisms to spread the risks of high-cost cases. RR. 101 would provide for aFederal reinsurance system in States that do not develop their own systems. CRS-5 151 1B91093 02-11-93Tax System OptionsFederal tax law might be modified in a variety of ways to help more individual,purchase health inaurance or to encourage more employers to provide group health plans. Some options being considered by Congress to encourage individuals to purchase coverage include: (1) liberalizing the deduction for health care coats, currently available only for costain excess of 7.5% of adjuated gross income (see H.R. 403); (2) providing a refundable tax credit(much like the earned income tax credit) to low-income families to subsidize the cost of healthinsurance (see, for example, Hit. 196, S. 28, and S. 223); and (3) creating a voucher program using the Federal tax system to subsidize the purchase of health insurance by low-incomefamilies. This approach was included in President Bush's health plan.A limited health insurance tax credit was created by the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1990 (PL. 101-508). Under the new law, a refundable tax credit isavailable to taxpayers for qualified health insurance expenses that include coverage for a qualifying child. Qualified health insurance expenses for which the credit is available are the premiums paid during the taxable year for health insurance coverage for children who meetcertain eligibility criteria (generally the same as for the Earned Income Tax Credit). For 1992,the maximum health credit i. $451.A new tax system approach embodied in a number of proposals is the establishmentof medical savings accounts (MSAs). Individual and/or employer contributions to theseaccounts would be excluded from income, and withdrawals to pay for medical care would alsobe tax-exempt. Current employer health plans might be replaced by a combination of an MSA and a limited, catastrophic health insurance plan. For example, employees might pay for the first $3,000 of medical expenses using the MSA, after which the insurance plan would be liable.Proponents contend that this would make consumers more cost-conscious while preservingcatastrophic protection. MSAs are included in H.R. 101, H.R. 150, and RR. 192.One tax issue that has received considerable attention is the treatment of healthinsurance coats for the self-employed. Self-employed workers, those in unincorporated soleproprietorships or partnerships, may deduct the full coat of contributions to health plans fortheir employees but only. a part of the cost of coverage for themselves and their families. TheTax Reform Act of 1986 established a time-limited 25% health insurance deduction for the self- employed. This deduction has repeatedly been extended; most recently, the Tax Extension Actof 1991 (P.L. 102-227) continued the 25% deduction through June 30, 1992. As passed by theCongress, Hit. 11, the Revenue Act of 1992, would have extended the deduction through June30, 1993. However, this legislation was pocket vetoed. Many of the comprehensive healthinsurance proposals in the 103rd Congress, as well as several free-standing bills, would increasethe deduction to 100% and make it permanent.Expanded Public ProgramsExisting Government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, could beexpanded to reach a larger population. In addition to the 'Medicare for all- plans, some proposals would expand Medicare less dramatically, by eliminating the current 24-monthwaiting period for benefits for some or all of the disabled, permitting early retirees to obtainMedicare coverage, or allowing unemployed workers to purchase Medicare. There are also proposals for further expansion of Medicaid, the Federal-State program for certain groups of low-income persons. In recent years, Congress has steadily expanded Medicaid eligibility forpregnant women and young children. Several proposals would further expand coverage by raising financial eligibility standards (H.R.. 200) or eliminating the categorical limit, thatrestrict Medicaid eligibility to the aged, disabled, and families with children (H.R. 191). H.R. CRS-6 152 13391093 02-11-93 196 would create a new, Medicaid-like program that could, at a State's optiOn, cover individualsup to 200% of the Federal poverty level. Medicaid expansions are also included in many of theemployer-based proposals discussed earlier, in order to reach persons not covered throughemployment.Health Care Costs and Cost ContainmentThe United States spends more per capita, and a greater prciportion of its grossdomestic product (GDP), on medical care than any other nation. U.S. health expenditures in15 V reached $675 billion, 12.4% of GDP, as compared to 9.0% in Canada, 8.1% in Germany,61 e in Japan, and 6.1% in the United Kingdom. All of these countries have universal healthinsurance coverage and perform at least as w. 11 as the United States on standard measures ofhealth care outcomes, such as life expectancy or infant mortality rates. There is also concernabout the rate of growth in health care expenditures. Inflation in the U.S. medical sector hasoutpaced inflation in the rest of the economy for many years; national health spending grewan estimated 11.5% from 1991 to 1992 and is projected to grow another 12.1% in 1993,reaching a total of $940 billion. The growth in employers' health insurance costs has beeneven more dramatic. One recent survey of medium and large employers found that the averagepremium for health benefits for a single employee rose 108% between 1987 and 1992, or about16% a year.Many observers view the high cost of health care as a major barrier to expanded accessto care for the uninsured, and there are concerns that continued inflation could either damagethe competitiveness of employers who offer health benefits or lead some of those employers toreduce or eliminate benefits, further eroding access to care. For all these reasons, there isstrong congressional interest in controlling health care costs, both in public programs and inthe private sector. Current legislative proposals may be divided among those that focus onreducing unnecessary use of services and those that focus on how services are paid for. Someof these proposals are included in broader health reform bills intended to address, both accessand cost, while others have been introduced separately.Insurance companies and public programs like Medicare and Medicaid have attemptedto control medical utilization directly for many years, using outside reviewers to monitor theappropriateness of medical services. However, medical care is still very subjective. Outsidereviewers may lack a firm basis on which to override the judgments of a patient's physician,and much of the variation in the way physicians practice (such as surgery rates) may betraceable to uncertainty or disagreement about what really works. In response, the 101stCongress created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, to perform systematicstudies of how well different ways of treating a given disease or condition work. Several healthinsurance proposals would expand this initiative. Congress is also considering measures toaddress a second issue closely tied to that of utilization control: malpractice reform. Thepractice of -defensive medicine; performing additional tests or services in response to concernsabout potential malpractice liability, is often cited as an important source of unnecessarymedical care utilization. Some propoaals, such as tort reforms, are aimed chiefly at limitingthe size of awards to plaintiffs, while others focus on simplifying the process for adjudicatingmalpractice complaints. Among the bills that address one or both of these areas are H.R. 101,H.R. 150, H.R. 191, H.R. 196, and S. 223.Another major option is reimbursement reform, changing the way hospitals anddoctors are paid for their services. Medicare has led the way in this area, with its prospectivepayment system for hospitals (under which hospitals receive a predetermined fee for eachpatient) and its new fee schedule for physician services. Some health insurance proposals CRS-7 4 r, 153 IB91093 02-11-93 would give private insurers the option of paying at Medicare rates; providers would be requiredto accept these amounts as payment in full. Under other proposals, all public and privateinsurers would pay the same rates. H.R. 200 would establish a national provider rate-settingsystem, with rates for all payers set using Medicare-like methods. Rates would be set at levelsdesigned to comply with a national health budget, an overall limit on the growth in health carespending.The eingle-payer proposals described earlier would also use price controls to limithealth spending. In addition, their proponents argue that a single-payer system could reducethe administrative costs of insurance and also of health care providers, who must now dealwith the differing demands of a variety of public and private insurers in order to obtainpayment. Other proposals seek to achieve similar savings in the context of a multi-payersystem. For example, a number of bine would promote the adoption of uniform claim formsand \"smart cards,\" health insurance identification cards that would carry electronically readablecoverage information and perhaps medical data about the cardholder.Finally, many insurance proposals emphasize 'managed care.\" The prototype for managed care is the health maintenance organization (HMO). Unlike other insurers, HMOsdirectly provide or arrange for health services, through affiliated physicians, hospitals, andother providers; the }IMO can thus control an enrollee's medical care, and may be able toprovide that care with greater efficiency. Recently insurers have developed other plans thatare somewhat less restrictive but still seek to manage overall patient care. Several bills wouldoverride State laws that may inhibit the development of managed-care programs; these includeH.R. 101, H.R. 150, H.R. 196, and S. 18.Several proposals, notably that of the Conservative Democratic Forum, would developstructured systems for \"managed competition.' Employers or other purchasers of health insurance would be grouped together in cooperative buying arrangements. Individuals participating in the arrangement would have a choice among different health care plans andwould be given a financial incentive to select the least costly plan (in theory, the mostefficient). The plan put forward by President Clinton during the 1992 campaign included asimilar proposal, but also would have provided for a health budget and possibly premium limitsas a backup cost containment approach.

HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES:SOURCES, CHARACTERISTICS, AND 'TRENDSINTRODUCTIONAND DETAILED SUMMARYNot since the 1970. has so much congressional attention been given to theissues of health care costa and access to coverage. By the end of the 102ndCongress, over 100 bills had been introduced in the House and Senate thatwould in one way or another provide for expanded financial access to health careand/or seek controls on the cost of health care. One of the factors fueling thisinterett is the statistical profile of inaurance coverage in this country. Thesestatistics have been used to define and pinpoint the problems, and have becomean integral part of arguments for and against specific policy solutions.This Congressional Research Service (CRS) report providing statistical dataand profiling health insurance coverage in the United States was written inresponse to requests from committees of the Congress to aid in their health carereform deliberations. The requesting House committees included: the Ways andMeans Committee's Subcommittee on Health, the Energy and CommerceCommittee and ita Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, and theEducation and Labor Committee. From the Senate, CRS received requests fromthe Committees on Finance, and Libor and Human Resources.The report is designed as a resource document, one which readers can turnto for facts and statistics regarding insurance coverage.' Part I providesinformation on public and private sources of health insurance coverage andidentifies the characterietics of those persons who have and do not have healthinaurance.Sources of health insurance are provided by age and otherdemographic characteristics. More detailed information on coverage by age andemployment characteristics such as firm size, industry, and labor forceattachment, is presented for different types of insurance (i.e., employment based,Medicare, Medicaid, and private individual (nongroup) coverage) and for theuninsured. Retiree health coverage is also examined. In addition, an analysisof trends in coverage is provided, looking especially at the issue of whether thepercentage of uninsured Americans is rising. The analysis in part I relies ondata from the Bureau of the Census, March 1992 Curren: Population Survey(CI'S), as well as the CPS for prior years.Part El provides information on the largest sources of coverage, privatehealth insurance, including individual as well ea employer-sponsored healthbenefits. It begins with an overview of private health insurance, describing whosells it, and the types of financing arrangements and policies available in the 'To assist readers, a complete list of tables and charts is included in thebeginning of this report. 1 (1 157 CRS-2 current market for groups and individuals. This is followed by a more detailedlook at employer-sponsored health insurance. It examines the characteristics ofemployers that do and do not offer coverage, alternative sources of funding foremployer health plans, trends toward self-insurance, small employer poolingarrangements, and flexible benefit plans. Information is also provided on theregulation of employer-sponsored health plans. Part II includes a discussion ofindividual health insurance, and ends with another source of largely privatecoverage, State high risk ineurance pools.Readers interested in issues such as the regulation of private healthinsurance, and options for expanding access to coverage may wish to consult thethree-part series produced by CRS in 1988: Health Insurance and theUninsured: Background Data and Analysis; Insuring the Uninsured: Optionsand Analysis; and Cost and Effects of Extending Health Insurance Coverage.'DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE REPORTPart I. Sources of Health Insurance CoverageIn 1991, 86 percent of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population had someform of health insurance coverage, while 14 percent (an estimated 35.4 millionpeople) were without any form of coverage. The uninsured were often youngand poor, but many of them did have some tie to the labor force, frequentlythrough small firms. By contrast, only 1 percent of the elderly (age 65 and over)were uninsured. Most people with health insurance had employment basedcoverage (65 percent of the nonelderly), while others were covered undergovernment sponsored plans such as Medicare and Medicaid or nongroupprivately purchased health insurance. Between 1979 and 1991, the percent ofpersons under age 65 who were uninsured increased approximately 4 percentage 2U.S. Congress. House. Committees on Education and Labor and Energyand Commerce.

Among workersunder age 65,about 26 percent of thoskeworkers earningapproximately the minimum wage had employment based coverage,compared to 62 percent of those earning between $9,000 and $19,999and 87 percent of those earning $30,000 or more.Over 90 percent of the spouses and children of workers withemployment based coverage also had this type of coverage. Still, 3percent of spouses and children were uninsured, accounting forapproximately 7 percent of the uninsured population in 1991.Employment based coverage varied by firm size and industry. About85 percent of workers and dependents in large firms (1,000 or moreemployees) had employment based coverage compared to 35 percent ofworkers and their dependents in small firms (1-9 employees).Approximately 90 percent of those working in public stIministrationhad employment based coverage compared to 27 percent of thoseworking in agriculturefforeetry/fisheries. 1_i_ t..,..... 159 CRS-4 Among retirees, 57 percent of those under age 65 reported employmentbased coverage compared to 32 percent of those age 65 and older.Individual/Nongroup InsurancePrivate individual (nongroup) health insurance is more commonamong two groups: those without attachment to the labor force orwhose employer does not offer health insurance coverage and theelderly who purchase private nongroup coverage to supplementMedicare.Medicare and Medicaid CoverageAmong persons 65 years and older, 96 percent had Medicare and lessthan one percent were uninsured.The greatest proportion of Medicaid recipients under age 65 was foundamong those not in the labor force: 39 percent of the head, ofinsurance units' with no attachment to the labor force and 63 percentof dependents with no attachment to the labor force received Medicaid.Only 4 percent of dependents of full year, full-time workers receivedMedicaid.Half of those receiving Medicaid were children, with 20 percent under5 years, and 30 percent between 5 and 17 years. Almost hslf of theMedicaid population wu white, while close to one-third was black.Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of those covered by Medicaid came fromfamilies with incomes below the poverty level.The UninsuredUninsured rates varied by age and sex. Females were less likely to beuninsured among persons age 18 to 34, but more likely to beuninsured among persons age 60 to 64.Uninsured rates also varied by age and race/ethnicity. The percentuninsured was higher for Hispanics in each age group than for whitesor blacks, and the percent uninsured was higher for blacks than forwhites. Almost one-half (45 percent) of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 wereuninsured, as were 39 percent of Hispanics ages 25 to 34.Employment characteristics were related to lack of insurance. Amongworkers, 13 percent of those with full year, full-time attachment to thelabor force were uninsured, compared to 37 percent of thou with partyear, part-time attachment. In small firms (1-9 employees), 37 percent 1An insurance unit comprises the policyholder and dependents (if any) whowould be eligible for dependent coverage under typical insurance rules. Seeappendix A for more detail. 160 CRS-5 of workers and 25 percent of their dependents were uninsuredcompared to 9 percent of workers and 5 percent of their dependents inlarge firms (1,000 or more employees). Thirty-five percent of thoseworking in personal services industries were uninsured compared to4 percent among those working in public adminietration.Persons who lacked health insurance coverage were not representativeof the population: the unintured were overrepreeented among youngadults, the poor, blacks and Hispanics, those with less than full-timejobs, and those who worked for small firms.Trends in Insurance CoverageTrends in health insurance coverage from 1979 to 1991 show that thepercent with employment based and private nongroup coveragedeclined over time, while the percent with Medicaid or Medicare andthe percent uninsured increased.From 1979 to 1986, the population under age 65 increased by 16million persons. If coverage rates had not changed over this period,population change would have produced 13 million more personscovered under various types of coverage, and if uninsured rates hadnot changed, 3 million more would have been uninsured. Decreasingrates of coverage and increases in uninsured rates meant instead thatonly about 8 million more persons were covered and 8 million morewere uninsured.Decreases in rates of employment based and private nongroup coveragebetween 1979 and 1986 produced about 3 million fewer persons withemployment based coverage and about 3 million fewer with privatenongroup coverage than would have been covered if rates had notdeclined.From 1987 to 1991, the population under age 65 grew by 8 millionpersons. If coverage rates and uninsured rates had not changed overthis period, population change alone would have produced about 7million more persons with coverage and about 1 million moreuninsured. Decreases in coverage rates and increases in uninsuredrates meant that only about 4 million more persons were covered and4 million more were uninsured.Decreases in employment based coverage rates between 1987 and 1991meant that about 7 million fewer persons had employment basedcoverage than would have been covered if rates had not declined.Increased coverage ratea under Medicaid lessened the effect ofdecreased employment based coverage rates, and kept the numberuninsured from rising even further. 161 CRS-6Part H. Private Health InsurancePrivate health insurance is the largest source of health benefits coverage,covering about 183 million Americans, or 73 percent of the population in 1991.In contrast, public coverage (including Medicare, Medicaid, military health care,and veterans' health care) covered about 63 million Americans, or 25 percent ofthe population. With respect to private health insurance, the report pointa outthe following:The sources of private coverage include about 1000 commercialinsurance companies (covering about 52 million persons in 1989); 73Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans (cc vering about 73 million); andother plans (covering 77 million), inc luding self-insured plans, self-administered plans, plans employing tl ird-party adminietrators (TPA),and about 550 health maintenance organizations (IIMOs) (whichcovered about 34 million persons). Many HMOs are operated by theBlues or commercial insurers. (The total of then numbers is greaterthan the number covered by private health insurance because someindividuals have more than one policy from more than one source.)Severed types of arrangements are used to pay for and, under somesystems, to provide health care service.. These include traditional, fee-for-service plans, which pay for services of the enrollee's choice ofhealth care provider for each service rendered (covering 62 percent ofenrollees in employer-sponsored group health plans in 1990), andnetwork-based managed care arrangements, which include network of providers from which enrollees receive health care services.Network managed care arrangements include HMOs (20 percent ofenrollees), preferred provider organizations (13 percent), and point ofservice (POS) programs (5 percent).A variety of types of private health insurance coverage exists,including medical expense insurance, which pays for medical bills orservices such as hospital and medical expenses (83 percent of grouppremiums paid to commercial insurers in 1989), dental expenses (8percent), Medicare supplemental costs (3 percent); and disabilityincome insurance, which pays for lost income while disabled (6percent).About 61 percent of Americans (152 million persons) have groupcoverage sponsored by their employers, and about 12 percent (30million persons) have individual (nongroup) coverage purchaseddirectly from insurers.Employer Sponeored Group Health InsuranceOver 61 percent of the population (152 million) is covered by employer-sponsored group health insurance plans. However, not all employers offerhealth benefits and, when benefits are offered, not all employees accept them. 162 CRS-7 Certain characteristics are predictive of whether an employer will offerinsurance. According to a 1990 survey of employers:Six. Only 27 percent of the smallest firms (fewer than 10 employees)offer health benefits, where.' 98 percent of those over 100 offercoverage.Type of industry. Government entities and manufacturing firms arethe most likely to offer coverage; retail trade firms are the least likelyto do so.Location. Employers in the South are least likely to offer coverage;those in the Northeast are most likely.Use of low-wage workers.Only 19 percent of firms in which 50percent or more of the workers earn less than 810,000 annually offerhealth benefits compared to 56 percent of all firms in which less thanhalf of the workers earn less than 810,000.Use of full-time workers. Of firms offering health benefits, only 20percent had a workforce in which lees than three-fourths of theemployees were full-time, compared with 34 percent for firms notoffering benefits.Employee turnover. Only 30 percent of firms with rate of turnoverexceeding 50 percent offered health benefits, compared with 52 percentof firms with lees turnover.Legal organisation. Sixty percent of incorporated firms and 26 percentof unincorporated firms offered health benefits.Firm size, type of industry, and the like are really proxies for othercharacteristics of a business that may affect its willingness or ability to offerinsurance.At the core of its decision is the price of inn:ranee. A firm'sassessment of whether it can afford to offer coversge and, if so, whether it needsto do so to attract and retain employees is largely based on price. As the costof health insurance continues to grow steadily higher, fewer firms may offercoverage. This may be at the root of the trend discussed above of decreases inthe percentage of the population covered under employer plans.Employers electing to offer health benefits do so through a variety ofarrangements.Once most common, fully insured health plans are foundprimarily in small firms.In addition to benefit payments, the cost of fullyineured plans reflects the insurer's profit and overhead, State mandated benefitsand premium taxes, and sometimes a State risk pool sasesement. To reducepremium carts and increase plan flexibility, many companies turn to self-insurance. Today, approximately 65 percent of firms self-insure and somewherebetween 50 to 56 percent of employees participate in self-insured health plans.As late as 1980, only about 34 percent of firms were self-ineuring. 163 CRS-8 Self-insured plans can be administered entirely by the employer, or by aninsurer or other entity. While self-insurance is most practical for large firms,the availability of stop loss policies to cover very large claims has made self-insurance increasingly attractive to even the smallest of firms. But with thegrowth in self-insurance has come a decline in consumer safeguards. State regulators have no jurisdiction over employer plans; they are only able toregulate the insurance sold to employers. Self-insured plans are regulated onlyunder Federal law which does little to protect enrollees from plan insolvencies,benefit cuts, or terminations.A relatively recent development affecting health benefits is the appearanceof flexible benefit plans (or 'flex plane) as part of employer sponsored fringebenefit packages.Flex plans permit employees with different familyresponsibilitiee to tailor their benefits to their own needs. They give employersa mechanism with which to set overall cost limits on their benefit offerings,especially important in respect to health care. By providing nontaxable benefits,flex plans also enable employers to increase their employees' after tax incomewithout paying higher wages. In 1989, 24 percent of full-time employeesworking for medium and large firms were eligible for flex plans, up from 5percent in 1986.While moat insured workers obtain health benefits through a singleemployer health plan, some are covered through various types of multipleemployer arrangements. Included among these are multiple employer welfarearrangements (MEWAs), which are generally health plans offered to theemployees of two or more employers by third party, such as a tradeaseociation. MEWAs are used to pool small employers into larger units to makehealth insurance more affordable and administratively simple. Bringing together a number of small firms into one pool, it is argued, can produceadministrative economies, such as reduced marketing, that will be reflected inlower premiums than if each firm sought coverage independently. Severalfactors may work against such savings, however. One is that insurers still tendto review the insurability of each of the member firms of the multiple employergroup.Individual (nongroup) Health InsurancePrivate individual (nongroup) coverage covers a much smaller proportionof the population than employer group coverage. Approximately 12 percent ofthe U.S. population (or about 30 million individuals) had individual insurancein 1991. The report describes the following features of individual coverage:For about 60 percent of those with individual coverage, such coveragewas their only source of insurance; the rest had euch coverage inaddition to some other type of coverage.Individuals purchase nongroup coverage when they have no employer-sponsored coverage or they are self-employed; for temporary periods 164 CRS-9 when they are between jobs or recently retired but not yet Medicare-eligible; or to supplement other coverage they may bave.Individual coverage differs from group coverage primarily in thegreater degree to which its applicants are underwritten, i.e., evaluatedby the insurer to determine the degree of risk the applicant represents.Individuals with existing medical conditions are less likely to beaccepted for coverage under a nongroup policy than a group policy.In 1987, about 65 percent of nongroup enrollees were covered bycommercial insurers, about 30 percent by Blue Cross and Blue Shield,and about 5 percent by HMOs. 165 92-168 EPWFebruary 12, 1992CRS Report for CongTess Trends, the President'sFY 1993 Budget ProposalsMelvina PfvdAnalyst in Social LegislationEducation and Public Welfare DivisionSUMMARYMedicaid is a Federal-State matching entitlement program providingmedical assistance to certain low-income persons. Mirroring the rapid increasesin health care spending generally, Medicaid is one of the fastest growing itemsin both Federal and State budgets. Federal spending for Medicaid is expectedto increase by 38 percent between fiscal years 1991 and 1992 and by another16.5 percent in FY r: 93. President Bush's FY 1993 budget proposes to limitgrowth in *mandatory* programs but would make only modest changes toMedicaid totalling $104 million in savings. Enactment of the President'slegislative proposals would reduce Federal Medicaid spending from the $84.5billion projected under current law to $84.396 billion in FY 1993.BACKGROUNDMedicaid, permanently authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act,is a Federal-State matching program providing medical assistance toapproximately 30 million low-income persons. Every State except Arizonaparticipates in the Medicaid program, as do the District of Columbia, AmericanSamoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern MarianaIslands. (Arizona currently provides federally funded medical assistance througha demonstration program that has received waivers of certain Medicaidrequirements.) Each State designs and administers ita own Medicaid program,setting eligibility and coverage standards within broad Federal guidelines. Atthe State level, Medicaid is administered by designated single State agency.Federal oversight of the Medicaid program is the responsibility of the MedicaidBureau in the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) within theDepartment of Health and Human Services.Traditionally, eligibility for Medicaid has been linked to receipt of benefitsfrom the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or the SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI) program. Recent changes in Federal Medicaid law haveextended eligibility to target populations who may previously have beenuninsured for health expenses. States are now required to cover pregnantwomen and children up to age 6 with household incomes up to 133 percent of CR,S Reports are prepared for litembers and committees of Congress reA 166 CRS-2 the Federal poverty level, and children aged 6 to 19 and born afterSeptember 30, 1983 in families with incomes up to 100 percent of the povertylevel. States also am required to pay premiums, &dui:ales, and coinourancefor low-inoome enrollees in Medicare, the Federal program for the aged an.idisabled. At the State's option, other medically needy persons may be covered.States are required to provide certain basic services such as hospital,physician, or preventive and primary health care services for children. Statesmay elect to cover additional servicee such as prescription dnip, dental care, orpodiatry. Within atatutory guidelines, States are free to develop reimbursementmethodologies and payment levels for covered services.Medicaid Financing and fipandissgThe Federal share of expenditures for Medicaid services is tied to a formulainversely related to the 'square of a State's per capita income. The formulaprovides a higher Federal matching rate to States with lower per capita incomes.By law, matching rates range from 50 percent to 83 percent of a State'sexpenditures for services.Matching rates for administrative coda vary byexpenditure category, rather than by State; they are generally 50 percent butmay be as high as 90 percent for specific items. The Federal share of Medicaidaccounts for about 57 percent of total program expenditures and is appropriatedfrom general funds.Because Medicaid is an ectitlement program, appropriations do not whollygovern the amount spent Participating States are entitled to receive paymentsfrom the Federal Government to cover the Federal share of outlays for services;individuals who meet Medicaid eligibility requirements are entitled to haveStates pay for medically mammary covered services provided to them. Medicaidspending is determined by the number of beneficiaries, the benefits offered, andthe amount of reimbursement for services. There is no limit on Federal Medicaid payments to States.Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) (Title MIL of theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 101-508), Medicaid spendingis subject to \"pay-ea-you-go rules governing entitlement programs. The budgetlaw requires that for fiscal years 1991 through 1995 any legislative changesmust be at least deficit neutral. Medicaid legislation that would increasespending must be offset by spending reductions in Medicaid or other entitlementprograms, or by revenue increases. Other factors that influence Medicaidspending, such as economic downturn or changes in States' eligibility rules, arenot affected by BEA.Medicsid is one of the fartest growing items in both Federal and Statebudgets. Following an increase of 27.8 percent from FY 1990 to FY 1991, theOffice of Management and Budget (011B) projects that Federal Medicaid outlayswill increase by 38 percent between fiscal years 1991 and 1992 and by smother16.5 percent in FY 1993. These percentage increases are emaciated with Federalspending levels of 52.5 billion in FY 1991, and projections to $72.5 167 CRS-3 billion in FY 1992 and $84.5 billion FY 1993. Total Federal-State Medicaidspending is setiinated at $92.1 billion in Fr 1991 and projected to reach $127billion in FY 1992.According to the OMB, the number of Medicaid beneficiaries has increasedfrom 23.5 million in 1989 to 30 million in 1992; the program is projected toserve 31.5 million in 1993. The sharp increase in expenditures is only partlydue to itlertelles in caseload. Other factors in the growth include generalincreases in health care costs, increases in reimbureement rates for Medicaidservices, and special payments to hospitals. State programs that leveraged taxesand donations to obtain more Federal fluids for Medicaid are responsible for apart of the recent growth. Several States levied special assessments on Medicaidproviders, usually hospitals, or accepted donations from them. Used as a portionof a State's share of Medicaid expenditures, revenues from providers generatedFederal Medicaid matching payments. Some States then repaid the providerstheir donations plus the Federal funds. Other States used the increased Federalfunds for general Medicaid spending. These State financing mechaniems werecurtailed by P.L. 102-234 which (1) tequires that levies be broad-based(uniformly imposed) and (2) caps the proportion of State Medicaid spending thatcan be financed by revenues from providers.'FY 1993 BUDGETLegislative proposals in President Bush's budget are projected to reduceFederal Medicaid costs by $104 million to $84.396 billion in Fy 1993. Thereduction represents the net impact of proposals to finance Medicaid survey andcertification activities through user fees, increase private health ineurancecollections for some children, and encourage AFDC recipients to undertakeentrepreneurial activities to achieve oelf-support through self-employment.

Hwang fatalities and certain suppliers participatingin the Medicaid program are subject to at least annual survey and certificationprocedures. States am responathie for conducting inspections to determinewhether providers can be certified as meeting the standards and conditions forMedicaid participation. The Federal matching rate to States for survey andcertification activities is 75 percent. Under the proposal, each provider orsupplier requesting Mediesid calification would pay an annual user fee as acondition of participation. Fees deposited into the revolving fund account wouldbe available to pay all Federal and State survey and certification costs as wellas associated HCFA administrative avenges. This change would make surveyand certification activities self-supporting in conformance with the precedenceset for certification of clinical laboratories.Current Medicaid law requires States to pay hospitals and nursing facilitiesrates that are remonable and adequote to meet the costs incurred. User feeswould be additional allowable costs that are reimbursable by Medicaid whenpayment to a facility is made on the basis of coats incurred. Savings from thechange would be the net difference between financing survey and certificationthrough user fees, and reimbursing the providers' costa. The proposal isestimated to reault in a net Federal saving of $99 million in FY 1999.Encourage EntrepremeuribipAll AFDC recipients must be covered by Medicaid. A proposal in thePresident's FY 1993 budget for AFDC could, if enacted, increase the number ofAFDC recipients and subsequently increase Medicaid cogs. President Bushpropooes a plan for achieving self-support (PASS) for AFDC recipients. Topromote entrepreneurial activities by AFDC recipients, the Preadent proposesto permit Stator to exclude some income and recounts from calculations ofAFDC eligibility. Exclusions would be available for recipients who developed,and obtained approval of a plan to achieve eelf-aupport through eelf-employment. Under PASS, families whose *excess' income and resources wouldhave made them inelighle for AFDC could retain AFDC and Medicaid benefits.The President's budget does Dot include more detail about PASS.Improve Medical Support EnfoaaressatA child who is covered by Medicaid may also be covered by private healthinsurance that is carried by a parent who does not have custody of the child andis not in the same household. The Adminatration propoees to arengthenmedical support enforcesneat and require States to ensure that noncustodialparents' health Mountain, insteed of Medicaid, provides medical support fortheir children. 169 CRS-5 The projected combined impact of propoeed legislation to encourageentrepreneurship among AFDC recipients and to strengthen medical childsupport is $5 million in FY 1993.Other ProposalsIn addition to the specific proposals described above, the Preeident'sFY 1993 budget mentions a need to supplement the pay-as-you-go rules of theBudget Enforcement Act with a mechanism to rertrict the 'automatic\" growthof entitlement programs. Without projecting savinp from the Medicaid programin particular, the Administration says there would be *enormous\" savings ifmandatory programs were permitted to grow only with changes in thepopulation and the consumer price index.One other item in the Administration's budget that could affect FederalMedicaid 'pending is a proposal to replace funding for individual programs witha consolidated block grant to States. According to the Administration, a similarproposal made in the FY 1992 budget has been modified following consultationwith representatives of State and local governments.To increase the flexibility ;iiat State and local governments have inmanaging their programs, the Administration proposes to conaolidate a numberof programs intoblock pant. Medicaid administrative expenses, estimated at$2.6 million in FY 1992 and $2.8 million in FY 1993, is among 19 programcandidates that the budget lists for inclusion in a block pant. Other candidatesinclude State administrative expenses for the AFDC and Food Stamp propams.This part of the Administration's proposal parallels a proposal for block grantconsolidation that was made by the National Governors' Association (NGA) inApril 1991. At that time, the NGA expressed support for a pilot project in 5 to10 States for consolidated grant administration of AFDC, Food Stamp, andMedicaid administrative expenses. For block grants in general, the NGA requested funding guaranteed over 5 years at levels agreed to among the States,Congress, and the Administration. The Administration propooes to phase in ablock grant over a 5-year period using a funding formula that wouldapproximate current funding distribution levels to individual States. 170 MILITARY HEALTH CAREXHAMPUSMANAGEMENT INITIMIVESSUMMARYWhile costs of tbe Military Health Services System (MHSS) as a whole haveincreased significantly in recent years, OMcosts of' the Civilian Health andMedical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) constituent part ofthe MSShave skyrocketed. The realms for these sharp increases include (1)a larger number of beneficiaries, (2) higher usage rates, (3) greater per capitacarts, (4) 'Kart-up costs of new management initiatives, (5) expenses created bynew technologies, (6) higher beneficiary expectations, aod (7) a benefit structurethat encourages inefficient use of certain services. Other issues besides costshave confronted Congress and Department of Defense (DOD) administrators.These include beneficiary dissatisfaction, the budget process, and the role ofCongress in overeseing these health care program.In order to reduce cost growth and otherwise improve management of theMHSS, DOD has proposed creating a system of coordinated care. In essence,this system will create a 'health network' approach to encourage patient use ofmilitary hospitals and preferred civilian networks (who share the risks for unitcost and volume). In addition, Congress has taken action to address many of thecurrent problems. These include the enactment of laws that provide for (1)placing sepsrate limits, cost-sharing and deductibles on CHAMPUS mentalhealth benefits; (2) increasing the individual and family CHAMPUS deductiblesfor most dependents and retirees; (3) expanding DOD's authority to collect fromthird-party insurers for servias provided at Military Treatment Facilities(MTF.); (4) requiringbetter management of reforms; and (5) limiting reductionsin medical personnel levels and facilities.These initiatives and changes in the MESS may have number ofimportant implications. First, local commanders will need subetantial trainingto interface with civilian providers in competitive health care environments.Second, risk-sharing and int:rased deductibles are politically contentious. Third,while many of these changes are justified in terms of bringing benefits in linewith what iscurrently available in the civilian sector,reducing theattractiveness of these benefits may have an effect on recruiting and :stainingquality personnel. Fourth, limits on CHAMPUS mental health care may beviewed as arbitrary and medially unjuetified. Fifth, pursuing third-partyinsurers could be viewed as forcing the private sector to assume DOD'sresponsibilities.Sixth, by not including Medicare in the coordinated careconcept, it is possZle that this policy, coupled with military budgetarylimitations, may have the effect of forcing thae over 64 years of age out of theMHSS and into Medicare.

Within this system, the Civilian Healthand Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), has experiencedeven more dramatic cost growth. CHAMPUS is the Department of Defense'sequivalent of a civilian health insurance plan. In fiscal year (FY) 1985, the coatof the CHAMPUS program was $1.36 billion.' By rt 1989, it had risen to$2.74 billiona 101 percent jump.2 In order to pay for the cost increase,Congress has provided the Department of Defense (DOD) with either (1)supplemental funds (additional to amounts stipulated in regular annual DODappropriations acts) or (2) authority to transfer funds from either DODprograms. To gain a greater measure of control over cost growth, both Congrosz:and DOD have undertaken a number of initiatives which may have an impacton the delivery of health care services.This report briefly describes CHAMPUS, its background, and its role in theoverall Military Health Services System. It also examines some of the majorissues facing MUSS administrators and congressional oversight committees, aswell as the steps being taken by key players to atrengthen and improve theprogram. Further, the report comments briefly on some of the broad economic,military, and political implications of recent, and possible future, changes. Itdoes not discus. specific CHAMPUS or MHSS coverage for individual care. BackgroundThe primary mission of the Military Health Services System (MIBS) is tomaintain the health of military personnel so that these personnel can carry outtheir missions and to be prepared to deliver health care during time of war. Insupport of thoie in uniform, the military medical system also provides, where 'U.S. Department of Defense.

Prior to 1956,the statutory authority to provide health care to retirees and dependents wasnot clear.The Dependents' Medical Care Act (Public Law 84-569; June 7, 1956; 70Stat. 250) described and defined retires/dependent eligibility for health care atmilitary medical facilities as being on a space avaiLble basis. Thus, for the firsttime, the dependents of active duty personnel were entitled to health care atmilitary medical facilities on a space available basis. Authority wes alsoprovided to care for retirees and their dependents at these facilities (withoutentitlement) on a space available basis. This legislation also authorized theimposition of charges for outpatient care for such dependents as determined bythe Secretary of Defense. Although no authority for entitlements was extendedto retirees and their dependents, the availability of health care was almostassured given the small number of such persons. Therefore, while not legallyauthorized, for many the 'promise of 'free health care 'for life wasfunctionally true. This 'promise, it is widely believed, was and continues to bea useful tool for recruiting and retention purpous.On September 30, 1966, Congress passed the Military Medical BenefitsAmendments, 1966 (P.L. 89-614; 80 Stat. 862). A. explained in a subsequentcommittee report: .. Congress recognized 'The Fading Promise' to retired militarypersonnel, as well as the plight of dependents of active duty memberswho were located away from military medical facilities and passed theCHAMPUS program to be effective the first day of 1967. This legislation also resulted from the comparatively disadvantageousposition in which the military dependents and retirees were placed,with Federal government employees [sic] health plans bloseomingprofusely, while the ability of military facilities to provide health carefor all concerned was diminishing.'Specifically, this 1966 legislation authorized:(1) an expanded hoepitalization program and a new outpatientprogram [in civilian facilities] for of on active duty; 'See the Glossary at end for a description of elispble dependents.'U.S. Congress. House. Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee No. 2,CHAMPUS and Military Health Care, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. Washington, D.C.,Dec. 20, 1974: 12. (2)new hospitalization and outpatient program (using] civiliansources for retired military members, their spouses and children, andthe spouses and children of deceseed retired members and of &mudactive duty members;(3) an expansion of care in military hospital facilities for all categoriesof dependents, to include treatment for nervous and mental disordersand chronic conditions; and,(4) a sPecialised program of fmancial assistance for members of theuniformed service on active duty whose spouse or children are eithermentally retarded or physically handicapped.'In effect, CHAMPUS became and remains the military equivalent of ahealth insurance plan, run by the DOD for the dependents of active dutypersonnel, military retirees and the dependents of retirees, and unmarrieddependent children or unremarried spousea of deceased service personnel orretirees.active duty personnel. who receive all their care via MilitaryTreatment FacilitiesMTFs. are not eligible to receive health care coverageunder CHANiPUS. Retirees remain eligible to receive CHAMPUS benefits untilthey become eliOble to receive Medicare (Part A) usually at age 65.Initially, GRAMPUS was designed to provide benefits equivalent to thoseavailable to Federal employees under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield high optionplan. Unlike private ineurance plans, CHAMPUS does not require the paymentof monthly premiums by beneficiaries.' Congreu has made relatively fewchanges in the CHAMPUS program during its first two decades.?While eligible beneficiaries may receive medical care at military facilities,this care is not always available because of limited space or limited types ofservices provided at the particular location. Another restricting factor might bethe long distance a beneficiary would have to travel to reach facility.CHAMPUS has provided cost-sharing benefits (both CRAMPUS and thebeneficiary sharing responsibility for the payment of care received) for coveredbenefits received from civilian health care providers (subject to CHAMPUSregulations). One of those regulations says that if beneficiaries need non-emergency inpatient etre and live within certain ZIP codes (catchment areas)surrounding the military medical facility (or a 50-mile radius in Europe), theymust first seek inpatient care at that military medical facility and must have 'U.S. Congress. Senate. Armed Services Committee, 89th Cong., 2nd Sue.,S. Rept. No. 1434. Washington, D.C., GPO.'For a more in depth discussion of CHAMPUS rulea and benefits, see U.S.Department of Defense, OCHAMPUS, CHAMPUS Handbook, Aurora, CO, July1990.thanges that were made included broadening the definition of eligibledependents; former spouaes were later included, for example. 1t 175 CRS-4 a signed document (nonavailability statement) stating that inpatient care wasnot available at that military facility beton CHAMPUS will cost-share theirinpatient cars at a civilian facility. A nonavailability statement does not meanthat CHAMPUS will ploy for health care outside the military medical servicessystemthe care received must also be covered by CHAMPUS. Nonavailabilitystatements are not required for outpatient services provided under CHAMPUS.Although the military encourages beneficiaries to utilize military sources ofhealth care, there is no requirement that they do so. Becauae of the variety ofsources of care, it is diflieult to predict wbo (retiree or dependent) will receiveoutpatient care and where (CHAMPUS or MT?) this care will be provided.Under CHAMPUS, beneficiaries pay part of the costs of allowable medicalcare received. The amount paid depends on a number of factors including thebeneficiary's status (dependent of active duty member, retiree, or the dependentof a retiree), the type of care received (inpatient or outpatient) and whether ornot the physician or hospital accepts CHAMPUS assignment.' In the lattercase, the payer/beneficiary is reimbursed by CHAMPUS only for CHAMPUS-allowable charges and services, which may vary from those actually billed.Providers who participate in CHAMPUS agree to accept the CHAMPUS\"allowable charge as their full fee. In certain areas, the availability of programsunder the CHAIOUS Reform Initiative may affect health care coats (see CRI inthe Glossary)\"Under coat-sharing provisions, CHAMPUS pays a proportion of 'reasonablecharges. Since CHAMPUS pays a proportion and not a fixed amount, increasesin medical costs in the civilian sector equate to increased payments byCHAMPUS and possibly the beneficiary, even though the percentage paidremains the same. Beneficiaries must pay a deductible before CHANIPUS beeneto cost-share.Protection against the potentially financial catastxophic results of care wereimplemented to limit the out-of-pocket expenses of beneficiaries. On October 1,1987, \"catastrophic caps' were placed on CHAMPUS to limit annual out-of-pocket expenses. The limits for active duty families and retiree families are$1,000 and $10,000 per year, respectively.\u00b0 'Health care providers who participate in CHAMPUS, or accept usignment,agree to accept the CHAMPUS allowable charge (including any cost share anddeductible) as the fidl fee.

Themoet significant of these, undoubtedly, I. cost growth. This issue as well asseveral other key concern. are discusaad in greater detail in the followingsection.MAJOR ISSUESCostsA1 the number of retirees and dependents has increased, so has the coat ofoperating CHAMPUS. In addition, those who live near military facilities haveoften been forced to use CHAMPUS because of a lack of available space or. a lackof services at these facilities. Finally, the shortage of military medical professionals has also forced many retirees and dependents to turn toCHAMPUS rather than seek more cost-tffective can at a military facility.When originally enacted in 1966, the House Armed Services Committee(HASC) estimated that the coot of running CHAMPUS in its first year would be$142 million (actual first year cost: $166 million). As reported almost ten yearslater: ... costa increased at an alarming rate, so that in FY 1976 theCHAMPUS budget was $509 million, an increase of 300 percent overthe 1966 cost.\"In FY 1985, costs reached $1.4 billion and by FY 1989 the total coets were $2.7billion. From FY 1967 through FY 1989, total Federal outlays (controlling forinflation) grew by 89 percent: CHAMPUS spending for this same period grewby 361 percent.In other words, CHAMPUS spending in constant dollarsincreased at a rate nearly four times that of Federal outlays (see Table 1 on thefollowing page). Overall medical coat increases in the military (direct care andCHAMPUS) have been roughly equivalent to those seen in the civil sector.According to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, EnriqueMendez, \"(0)f note is the fact that the military's rate of health care cost growthhas tracked the civilian rate very closely for the last several years. Indeed, themilitary health colts have risen at a slightly slower rate than the civilian costssince 1985: 55% compared to almost 58%.'\"The reasons for these rapid increases in costs are numerous. First, thenumber of eligible beneficiaries has increased substantially. The number ofrent ees and their dependents has increased from 2.4 million in 1964 to 3.2million in 1974\" to nearly 6.2 million in 1990.\" Currently, there are a totalof 9.2 million military medical beneficiaries (including active duty personnel and \"US.

D.C., Sept. 17, 1989: 13. 1t) 177 CRS4 retirees over 65 who are not eligible for CHAMPUS). The number ofCHAMPUS-eyele beneficiaries is approximately 6 million.Second, bealth care is being used with greater frequency. From FY 1984-FY 1988 the number of outpatient visits covered by CHAMPUS increased from4,578,111 to 8,568,455. During this same period, the number of hospital daysincreased from 2,215,885 to 2,639,632. It is notable that during this same periodthe average length of stay actually decreased from 7.8 to 7.3 more admissions for shorter stays.\" In part, the increase in the utilizationrates of health care is due to theaging of the military beneficiarypopulation. Older beneficiaries tendto have higher admission rates tohospitals and may displace youngerbeneficiaries at Military TreatmentFacilities (MTF1). CHAMPUS costs in to $432 in FY1989.\"The fact that these CHAMPUS-eligiblebeneficiariesmayusemilitary health care facilities 'placesa squeeze on active duty families,operational missions of ...

Third, in some cases, cost growth can be attributed to a decrease in workload at military medical facilities: military facilities may not have sufficient staffpersonnel, or may be shut down entirely. Eligible dependents who are unableto receive care at military medical facilities turn to the more expensiveCHAMPUS plan.The availability of medical professionals can be acutelyaffected by incidents such as the Persian Gulf war where large numbers ofmilitary medical personnel are deployed, leaving only a limited number ofpersonnel at home to care for active duty personnel. In the long run, the mobilization of medical reservists to take the place in MTFs of deployedpersonnel (i.e., backfill) may have helped to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs,CHAMPUS Reform Initiative Executive Conference, U.S. Naval Training CenterSan Diego, CA, Oct. 25, 1990. I 178 CRS-9 shortages at MTFs that would otherwise have caused beneficiaries to be divertedto CHAMPUS.Fourth, during recent years, new initiatives designed to restrain costa havecaused cost increases in the short run. Start up coats include, but are notlimited to, funds spent for administrative changes, education and publicawareness, as well as contracting These initiatives are generally designed torestrain cost growth and are not expected to reduce costs but rather curtail therate of coet growth.'Fifth, technological improvements generally increase (not decrease) overallhealth care ccets. Expensive ..,r2t.;ng proc.dures, such as Computerized AxialTomography (CAT scans) and 1.1.ignetic Resonance Imaging (bin), boost costs.Procedures or therapies that increase longevity for certain illnesses withoutcuring the illness may also increase costs. This is true in the case of the drugAZT and AIDS, for example.Sixth, increased patient expectations also have acted to boost costs.Today's patients are better informed and expect to benefit from a broad arrayof sophisticated and wetly medical services.'Seventh, the benefit structure of CHAMPUS and military health care ismore generous than that available in the civil sector. This generosity hasencouraged use above and beyond the rate in the civil sector in certain areassuch as mental health. For example, it was found that the structure of thesebenefits provided an incentive to use costly inpatient care, even when outpatientcare would be more appropriate?'Illegal activities have not been reported to be significant contributors toincreasing costs. Few cases of fraud or abuse have been detected, and measureshave been adopted to avoid them. According to the CHAMPUS Office ofProgram Integrity, which monitors reports of fraud and abuse, 297 cases werefinalized (investigated and closed) in 1989.21 \"For example, the U.S. Comptroller General reported that by usingcontracting strategies (e.g. Project Restore) \"CHAMPUS costs will be reduced by$43 million in fiscal year 1990 after an expenditure of about $25 million [stareup costs] on the projects? U.S. Comptroller General, General Accounting Office,Defense Health Care: Potential for Savings by Treating CHAMPUS of CHAMPUS Mental Health Policies, Submitted to:Department of Defense Health Affairs Health Program Management, June Chartbook, Aug. 1990: P1-21. 179 CRS-10 Beneflciary area of concern is beneficiary dissatisfaction. Because militarypersonnel are reassigned routinely, and becauee the availability of medical careservices varies from location to location, services available at a previousaseignment may be unavailable, or available to a lesser extent, at the currentusignment. Comparirons tend to highlight current 'deficiencies.\" This does notmean that this care is perfect or abeolutely deficient. Instead, it emphasises thewychological effect of relocation and variations in care available. Ironically,although most service members, retirees, or their families can describe problemsthey have encountered, many are interested in expanding the availability of carevia DOD.\u00b0Many of the complaints against CHAMPUS are specific in nature andwould be viewed as 'problem* in other health care programs. These are:finding physicians who accept CHAMPUS payments;non-coverage of experimental procedures;late reimbursement to physicians or beneficiaries;not all physician \"mandated care is covered (some patients believe thata nonavailability statement is a voucher for services they received tobe covered by CHAMPUS);'high' out-of-pocket expenses. (Although there are catastrophic capeto limit out-of-pocket expenses, medical costs can be significantportion of a family's budget.)Many of theee problems are the reault of a lack of understanding of whatbenefits are available.Dissatisfaction, however, can be a healthy means of acknowledging wheredeficiencies may exist. The growth in demand, for example, has itself createdmanagement problems in that it has become difficult to deal efficiently with anexpanding population of beneficiaries who themselves are using CHAMPUS ata greater rate. Theme problems crests administrative delays in the servicesrendered by CHAMPUS.While beneficiaries continue to receive care,reimbursement has been delayed significantly. In ortler to expedite claims \"US. Congress. House, Committee on Armed Services. Military Personneland Compensation Subcommittee, Hearings, Military Medical Care, 100th Cong.,1st Sose.,.HASC Rapt 100-48, Washington, D.C., 1987. 180 CRS-11 processing, CHAMPUS has contracted with civilian ineurers such as BlueCross/Blue Shield to process claims more efficiently.\"Ro Ie of CongressSince Congress influences and has some level of contxol over military healthcare, complaints are directed to political leaders for 'corrective action.' Congresshas a difficult role when compared to policymakers in the private health caresector. Few private insurance Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) can be voted outof office by their policyholders they are answerable only to their shareholders.Most private care insurers or providers are primarily concerned with theeconomics of providing care what can be provided, at what ccet/profit, etc.Congress is faced with the reality that many military members, retirees anddependents believe that military health care is free and guaranteed for life.While this latter assumption in not true in terms of entitlements actuallyauthorized by statute, this still tends to color the reform debate. Congress mustaddress both the economics and politics of providing care. Thus, for Congress,the decision of what care to provide, who may receive this care, how it isdelivered, and so on is often influenced by expectations and economic (as wellas medical) concerns. A decision may be politically sensible, but economically ormedically controversial. Conversely, other programs or issues may themselvesbe politically problematicMedicare catastrophic care or abortion. Therefore,Congress is in a position, vis-a-vis CHAMPUS oversight, that is quite differentfrom the position of thaw managing private or even other public health careprograms.In addition, military health care has a role in a larger context nationaldefense. Congress needs to consider that the nature of military service and theburdens it places on service members and their families is arguably differentfrom those in civilian employment situations. The types of health care servicesavailable to members of the armed forces are often justified in terms of theunique role of the armed forces in general, as well as the unique role of healthcare in the context of the military.Budget ProcessFinally, the budget process itself has created problems in recent years. Inbudgetary terms, CHAMPUS is an account to which funds are annuallyappropriated, but which incurs obligations as benefits are used. It is important,therefore, that the amount of money requested and appropriated closely matchthe expected costa of these benefits. According to the House FY 1991Authorization report:'The DOD has repeatedly failed to include adequatefunding for CHAMPUS in budget submissions ... The committee, therefore,directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that future budget submiseions are 'See U.S. Congress. House.

A pattern seen in the budgetprocess in recant years is as follows:DOD submits a budget apparently not able to precirely project whowill receive care, where, or from whom; the budget represents anunderestimate, given the enormous growth rate in the program;Congress underfunds this budget;By the fourth quarter of the FY, CHAMPUS is out of funds;DOD approaches Congress for supplemental funding;Congress provides transfer authority, supplemental appropriationsand/or DOD carries over costa to the next fiscal year;Supplemental aopropriations, the reprogramming of funds from otherDOD programs, or carryovers are used to cover CHAMPUS obligations.According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, CHAMPUS budgetshortfalls from fiscal year 1985 through 1989 totalled $1.8 billion. Table 2 shows the budget shortfall in each of these yaws as well as the methodemployed to finance each fiscal shortfall. Underestimating, underfunding,carryovers, supplemental appropriations, and transfer authorities have tendedto obscure and delay solutions to these budgetary problems.'

Accounting Office, FundingShortfalls in CHAMPUS, GAO/HRD-90.99BR, B-231236, Mar. 19, 1990. 182 CRS-15 WHAT IS BEING DONE?'Coordinated Care'In 1990, Assistant Secretary of Defenee for Health Affairs (ASD/HA)Enrique Mendez proposed creating a system of coorilnated care to address manyof the problems confronting the delivery of DOD haalth services.Under the present system, there are nearly 9.2 million elieible beneficiaries.It is currently impossible to predict who will eeek medical treatment, and where(Army, NavyMarine Corps, Air Forceincluding Primus and Navcarefacilities, Uniformed Service Facilities, CHAMPUS, Medicare, VA, orother third-party insurers including IIMOs, PPG. see Glossary) they will seekit. For this reason, the cost of providing care is an uncertain obligation. Underthis initiative, which received congreuional approval, care will be coordinatedin order to 'control the rate of growth in military health care costs and improvethe quality of health benefit.? It is expected that this coordinated care systemwill create a health care system that I. managerially sound, eliminateuncertainty of coet and demand, and introduce accountability to health careoperations. In addition, this system 'does not pass on to military beneficiariesthe significant increaus in health care costs?\"In euence, this system will create a \"health network' approach whichencourages patients to use military hospitals and preferred civilian networkswho share the risks for unit cost and volume.Nine steps will be taken:\"(1)Health care management will be integrating via closer coordinationamong the services, CHAMPUS and alternative civilian provider networks. Inother words, instead of being managed separately, these provider networks will,to the extent possible, be brought together under a more centralizedmanagement arrangement.(2) MHSS users will be enrolled in a local coordinated care systemconsisting of military and civilian health care resources.(3)Local commanders will competitively contract with networks ofeffective, quality civilian doctors and hospitals. When demand exceeds supplyat the MTF, theu networks linked to military hospitals will be used, andpatients guided only th that level of care necessary and appropriate. \"See Mendez, Enrique. Remarks to Military Coalition Conference, Kir ForceAseociation Building, Rosalyn, VA, July 20, 1990: 9.\"See Mendez, 77th Interagency Institute, 1990. 183 CRS-16 (4) Patients will select a primary care entry point in this network whosedoctors and nurses will be responsible for insuring appropriate care in thecorrect setting.(5) The military hospital should always be the first choiee to treatCHAMPUS-eligibles if care is available. (In FY 1988, of the 129 militaryhospitals in the U.S., 121 had occupancy rates at or below 70 percent At thesame time, about 70 percent of CHAMPUS coda were being incurred withinWIT catchment amis.)\"(6) The nature of CHAMPUS will change:CHAMPUS will be a financier of care and not an alternativedelivery system.CHAMPUS will have to improve as financierphysicianreimbursementsneedimprovementprevailing rates will be paid (CHAMPUSpays on average 43 percent above whatmedicare pays).qualitycontrolandutilizationmanagement will be improved.One benefit will be modified inpatient mental healthResidential Treatment Centers (RTC-seeGlossary) for adolescents and inpatientpsychiatric care increased by 127 percentfrom 1986 to 1989.Mental healthaccounted for 25 percent of the totalCHAMPUS budget in FY89 (see Table 3).(7) CHAMPUS will provide greater support to local commanders andadministrators in dealing with sophisticated and competitive local health caremarkets. \"See also U.S. Comptroller General, GAO, Defense Health Care: PotentialSavings.

(8) CHAMPUS will establish new standards to judge efficiency andeffectiveness of providing health care and hold local commanders accountable.(9) CHAMPUS will educate the consumer. Beneficiaries need tounderstand that in a managed care system there are trade-offs in terms ofabsolute freedom to choose the source of health care vs. limited access, quality,continuity of care and possible financial incentives.It is expected that these changes will be implemented immediately whileothers will be implemented over a period of years. 185 CRS-18 Legislative InitiativesThe FY91 DOD Authorization Act.\u00b0 as amended by the Persian GulfConflict Supplemental Authorization and Personnel Benefits Act of 1991,'included a number of provisions concerning health care. Many of theseprovisions are a direct result of issues discussed above.Recognising the extraordinary increase in mental health care costs,provisions in the law relating to CHAMPUS were changed so that inpatientpsychiatric care wa limited to 30 days per year for patients over 18 years of age,and 46 days for patients under 19 years of age (with waivers allowed in certainsituations). For thou seeking admission, Congress stated that a mandatorypreauthorization of inpatient care would be required. Recognizing civilian practices in this area, it wsa also considered appropriate that separatedeductibles, cost-sharing, and catastrophic caps be implemented for mentalhealth care.In addition, Congress capped care at a residential treatment center (RTC)at 150 days per year with the possibility of a waiver for extraordinary cases.Mental health benefits provided by DOD have been very generous. The creationof theft new policies would bring DOD care in line with care available in thecivilian or private sectors.Congress prohibited DOD from reducing the number of medical personnel(endstrengths), without justification, u a result of the reduction or draw clownof military personnel in general. The availability of military medical personnelshould keep health care costs down by allowing eligible beneficiaries to receivecare at military facilities rather than via CHAMPUS or other more expensiveoptions.The skyrocketing increase in CHAMPUS costs has prompted Congresa tolegislate an increase in the CHAMPUS deductible from $50 and $100 forindividuals and families, respectively, to $150 and $300. In the case of adependent or family of an enlisted member below pay of E-5 pay grade, thedeductibles remain at $50 and $100, respectively. While the tripling of thesedeductibles may seem dramatic, it is important to note that they have notincreased since their creation in 1966. In fact, the new rate is less than whatthey would be had they been indexed to inflation, and it is less than the 1990rate for Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan-FEHBA BC/BS upon which theywere originally modeled. Currently, the BCIBS deductible is $200 per person,two family members paying $200 maximum each for the family deductible, and$50 per inpatient admire/on.Congress also expanded DOD's authority to collect from third-partyinsurers for services provided at MTFs. The Authorization Act expands the *PL 101,510; Nov. 5, 1990; 104 Stat. 1485.l*P.L. 102-25; April 6, 1991 186 CRS-19 current collection authority to include outpatient, as well as inpatient care. Inaddition, collections may also be made from Medicare supplemental coverage tothe extent that such payments would have been made had Medicare been used.Congressional concerns over the implementation of the CHAMPUS ReformInitiative (CRI, see Glossary) prompted language that set conditions to be metbefore the program was authorized to expand. These conditions include (1) thatCRI should show itself to be more cost effective than CHAMPUS or any otherhealth demonstration project being conducted by the Secretary, (2) that thecontractor selected to underwrite the delivery of health care under CRI shouldaccomplish the expansion without disruption to CHAMPUS beneficiaries ordelays in the processing of claims, and, (3) that the contractor should be able tofinancially underwrite CRI, both currently and in the future. Further, theComptroller General and CEO will be required to submit a report within 30 daysof the Secretary's certification evaluating that action.Language was also included that will require a closer look at UniformedService Treatment Facilities (USTF). The House Armed Services Committeerestated its interest in the feasibility of making USTF5 integrated members ofa managed care model. From FY82 through FY88, costs to DOD for carereceived at these facilities increased at an extraordinary rate. The USTFs areformer Public Health Service Facilities that were initially authorized to providecare to members/beneficiaries of the uniformed services at the same cost (rate)beneficiaries would pay at MTFe. Some USTF agreements have since beenmodified to allow for payments under CHAMPUS terms. This designated statushas been continued while awaiting a report from the Secretary. Should theSecretary find that more cost effective care is available elsewhere in thegeographic region, this designation would be terminated. Otherwise, it isexpected that these facilities would become members of a managed care model.Lacking receipt of this report, Congress has extended the designated-statustermination date to December 31, 1993, capped funding of these facilities,provided the Comptroller General with the authority to examine records at thesefacilities and required the Comptroller to audit these facilities during FY89 andFY90 (with particular attention paid to funds and the source of funds forlobbying efforts by these facilities).Also, Congresa required that the Secretary concerned must submit toCongressreport before any Military Treatment Facility is closed ordowngraded (except in the case of a bue closure). This report must address (I)the reason for the action, (2) the projected savings to the Government, (3) theimpact on CHAMPUS and Medicare in the catchment area, (4) the impact onbeneficiary cost-sharing, (5) alternative ways to provide care to the beneficiarypopulation that would not result in an adverse impact on this population, and(6) an explanation of how care would be provided and at what costs to thebeneficiary population.The House Armed Services Committee has noted its annoyance at theproblems concerning CHAMPUS budget submiuiona and has directed theSecretary to ensure that future budgets are based on accurate projections of 187 CRS-20utilization rates and reflect a realistic estimate of the true cost of theCHAMPUS program.\"The House committee has stated its pleasure with and support of thecoordinated care program (outlined above) and intends to monitor DOD'sprogress in achieving its goals.Finally, the House committee encouraged DOD to continue in its effortsconcerning health promotion.\" It is believed that these efforts will yieldgreater benefits to personnel and their families as well as result in cost savingsto the Department. \"US. Congresr. House. National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year1991: 297.'Health promotion activities include educational program intended toprovide beneficiaries information and services that lead to a healthier lifestyle.Smoking cessation, weight control, exercise and nutrition, and drug/alcoholabuse programs are examples of health promotion activities. 1' 64-300 0937 188 CRS-21/ ASSESSMENTAs a reeult of the above initiatives, a number of results may be anticipated.First, local military health care commanders will have greater control of thehealth care delivery, system and can take steps to ensure that needed care isprovided efficiently and economically within the parameters of local resources.Local commanders will be given control over the budgets for health care(including MTFs and CHAMPUS). However, military managers will needsubstantial training to interface with civilian/community level providers incompetitive environments.Legal, contracting, and political issues arepredictable as Military Treatment Facilities become *dive players in the localcivilian marketplace.Second, risk snaring arrangements, increased deductibles, caps on servicesprovided, and separate deductibles for mental health care are likely to be viewedby beneficiaries as an erosion of earned benefits. Such changes are politicallycontentious.Third, many of these reforms are being justified in terms of changes in thecivilian sector brougbt about largely by the same concern over cost increases.However, the military services recognize that health care benefits are an integralelement in their ability to attract and retain personnel. Justifying changes onthe basis of the civilian sector (and making DOD benefit. more comparable towhat is found in the civilian sector) might have an adverse effect on recruitingand retention.Fourth, health care providers view the restrictions on care coverage andcaps, particularly in the case of mental health, as arbitrary and artificiallylimiting the amount of care that may be required. They argue that this createsan implicit tax on the provider and possibly the patient.\"Fifth, expanding DOD's collection authority to a broader range of third.party payers is likely to generate additional revenue. However, private insurersnote that their premiums are based on the fact that a certain proportion of theirpopulation will receive health clue from the military (for free). Forcing third-parties to pay will increase premiums for all those covered by private providers.In essence, changes in the military health care system can affect thoeeindividuals and payers not affiliated with DOD. Private insurers view the \"According to testimony submitted before the House Subcommittee onMilitary Personnel and Compensation, April 24, 1991, Bryant Welch, ExecutiveDirector of Practice for the American Psychological Association, stated '... (0)urexperience with governmental agencies (such as CHAMPUS...) involved in healthcare delivery is that they not only consistently underestimate both the overallconsumption and the cost of providing such services but also intensify overallcosts by ineffective, cost intensive review programs.' Arguably, differences inconsumption and compensation, as well as additional costs as a result of reviewmust be paid, at least in part, by the provider who may view it as an implicit taxon services provided. 4,4\u00b0. te' 189 CRS-22 expanded pursuit of third-party payment ae an unfair method easume responsibilities.\"Conversely, collectir.from third-party inrurers may be viewed as receivingbenefits already paid for by the beneficiary and/or his/her employer. Arguably,it is unfair to provide a windfall to these insurers at the texpayers expense.Sixth, some have raised a question of age discrimination. Nowhere in thelegslation nor in the Assistant Secretary of Defense's proposal is it dated thatage should be used as a method of deciding how care is delivered. However, itis possible that those over age 64 will be excluded from the IIIHSS network. Asnoted above, military retirees who become eligible for Medicare (usually at age65) lose their entitlement to CHAMPUS. Persons over age 65 incur much largerthan average health care expenses.\" It is argued that given limited budgets,military health care commanders could seek to exclude the 65+ population fromthe MHSS, thus forcing them to seek care from Medicare. Forcing thispopulation to Medicare (which can be more expensive for the beneficiary), wouldlikely:1.Keep military costs down;2.Keep military hospital space available for those who mightotherwise be forced to use CHAMPUS; and,3.Keep military medicine directed toward a 'young andvigorous force.Retirees contend that it would be better if all sources of health carecoverageincluding Medicarewere made a part of the military CoordinatedCare network. It is argued that by including Medicare, health care received at \"Congress expanded collection for hospitalization in 1985 under theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. The insurance industry opposed theexpansion 'saying it would force companies to raise premiums: (Smith, Paul,Services to Start Collecting for Hospitalization, Army Times, Sept. 29, 1986, 22).Such increases in premiums would affect both the companies and non-militarypolicy holders.For a more detailed discussion, see U.S. Congess. House.Committee on Armed Services, Collection from Third-Party Payers of Costs ofCertain Medical Care Provided in l'acilities of the Uniformed Services, 98thCong., 2nd Sess., House Rept. 98-75. May 15, 1984.\"DOD patients who are in the age soup 65-74 use twice as many bed daysper year than patients 45.64. By the time a patient reaches age 75, he uses fourand one-half times as many hospital bed days per year. By the year 2000, DODconservatively projects the number of persons over age 65 who are eligible forcare in military hospitals will exceed 1.5 million. That is four times more thanthe number of those eligible in 1980, and approaches twice the 910,000 who areeligible today. See: Mendez, Enrique, 77th Interagency Institute: 6. 1 0 190 CRS-23 an MTF could be billed to Medicare under 'Medicare subvention funding.'In this way, the military commander would not assume the oost of caring forthoose eligible for Medicare, and the retiree would continue to have the optionof receiving care at an MTF. In addition, the true support provided by the MTFwould be recognised. It can be argued that if subvention funding were allowed,administrative costa resulting from coordination between the two progremswould increare. Since receiving care at an MTF is cheaper than at privatefacilities, allowing for subvention funding may actually result in savings for theMedicare. In other words, health care provided by DOD could be cheaper forMedicare than the same care provided in the private sector and billed toMedicare.However, military provided care for Medicare-eligibles currentlyprovides a windfall to Medicare. Therefore, should subvention funding beallowed, it is likely that Medicare outlays would increase. These Medicare costswould, arguably, increaae to a greeter extent if Medicare-eligible retirees wereturned away from military health care and forced to receive care in the privatesector via Medicare.Faced with limited budgets, the need to attract CHAMPUS patients toMTF., and the expense of providing care for thaw over age 64 who mayotherwise be sent to Medicare, some commanders might opt to use MTF spacesfor CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries and refer those over 64 to Medicare.Finally, the ability of DOD and Congress to reform the situation of theMUSS muat be considered. Politically, this issue is troublesome. Members ofCongress are faced with (1) a military medical budget that is skyrocketinginspite of efforts to slow its growth, (2) growing constituency (military activeduty/retirees/dependents) demanding their 'promised' benefits, and (3) a budgetdeficit and political atmosphere that makes cuts in the overall military budgetnecessary. *Military members pay Social Security taxes that entitle them to Medicarecoverage.

Smith. Washington,Congressional Research Service, Updated Regularly. p. 2-5. Health ProgramsThe VA provides health care to eligible veterans in its own facilities171 VA hoepitals, 129 nursing homes, 354 outpatient clinics, and 35 domiciliaries. Care is also provided through VA contractual agreements with non-Federal facilities, such as community hospitals and nursing homes and on a grant basis in State veterans' home facilities. Certain dependents and survivors of vetersns are eligible for VA medical care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA). Care for dependents and survivors is generally provided in non-VA facilities.Current eligibility requirements for veterans' inpatient hospital and nursing homecare were established in 1986 by P.L. 99-272, as amended by P.L. 101-508 in 1990. TheVA is required by law to furnish free hospital care and may furnish free nursing home care to veterans in the 'mandatory care\" category. Veterans in the mandatory care category include veterana with service-connected disabilities; former prisoners of war; certain veterans exposed to Agent Orange or atomic radiation; veterans disabled as a result of VA treatment; pre-World War II veterans; veterans receiving cash assistance under the VA's income-based pension program; veterans eligible for the income-based Medicaid program; and veterans with nonservice-connected conditions who have annual incomes at or below $18,843, if single, and $22,612, if married with one dependent, plus $1,258 for each additional dependent.The VA is allowed to provide hospital care and nursing home care to other veterans but only if space and resources are available and if they contribute to the cost of care. So called \"non-mandatory category' veterans are those with health conditions not related to their military service who have incomes above the mandatory categorylevels. To receive VA hospital care, they must pay the lesser of the cost of care received or the amount of the Medicare deductible (currently $652) for the first 90 days of care during any 365-day period, plus $10 per day beginning on the first day of care. For each succeeding 90 days of care, they are required to pay the lesser of the cost of care received or half the amount of the Medicare deductible (currently $326) plus the $10- per-day copayment. To receive nursing home care, they must pay the lesser of the cost 4-1 194 1891053 12-04-92 of care or the Medicare deductible for each 90 days of care during each 365-day period,plus $5 per day beginning on the first day of care. The per-day copayments were firstestablished by Pl. 101-508, and are currently in effect through FY1997. PL. 101-508also established $2 copayments for each 30-day supply of medication furnished on anoutpatient basis to veterans treated for a nonaervice-connected condition (exceptveterans with service-connected disabilities rated 50% or more), also in effect throughFY1997. Leeslation adopted at the end of the 102d Congress exempted low incomeveterans (those eligible for VA pension payments) from the medication copaymentrequirement (PL. 102-568).LegislationPersian Gulf War Veterans. Proposals to address certain health care concernsrelated to service in the Persian Gulf War were enacted during the 102d Congress. ThePertian Gulf personnel benefits package (P.L. 102-25) included amendments makingPersian Gulf War veterans eligible for certain existing veterans' health benefits, forwhich they would not have been automatically eligible. PL. 102-25 also expandedeligibility for VA readjustment counseling services under the Vet Centers program toany veteranincluding Persian Gulf veteranswho has served on active duty after May7, 1975 in an armed conflict area. (Vet Centers services formerly were available onlyto Vietnam-era veterans.) In addition, the law required DOD and VA to submit reportsto Congress on the need for services for Persian Gulf service members who experiencepost-traumatic strew disorder (PTSD), the availability of PTSD treatment services andresources, PTSD treatment plans and related information. A marriage and familycounseling program for certain Persian Gulf War veterans and their families wasauthorized by provisions contained in PL. 102-405.Legislation was adopted to require the VA to establish and maintain a registrydocumenting the health status of veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War theater,including any disability claims filed by such veterans (P.L. 102-685). The measure alsorequired the VA to provide health examinations, upon request, to eligible veterans. Thelaw expanded coverage of the DOD registry (established by P.L. 102-190), which listsservice members exposed to fumes of burning oil in the Persian Gulf. In addition, thelaw required the Office of Technology Asaessment to monitor the development andmaintenance of both VA and DOD registries, to study the utility of the registries andthe adequacy of VA and DOD health examinations, and report its findings to Congress.DOD and VA are required to jointly fund National Academy of Sciences review ofscientific and medical information on the health consequences of in-theater serviceduring the Persian Gulf War. And finally, the law requires the President to designatea Federal agency head to coordinate all Federally-funded research in this area.Nurse and Physician Pay. In response to concerns about the VA's ability to attractand retain qualified health personnel in ita hospitals, legislation was enacted to revisethe \"special pay\" rules under which higher salaries are awarded to physicians anddentists for certain recruitment and retention categories specified in law. P.L. 102-40increased the amounts of special pay that are awarded bated on full- and part-timestatus, length of VA service, scarcity in a medical specialty, and oervice in executivepositions. The law also added \"exceptional qualifications' as a new category for whichspecial pay can be awarded. In addition, P.L. 102-40 amended VA labor relations rulesto subject certain conditions of medical care employment to collective bargaining rightsand to revise grievance procedures for various VA medical care personnel. Legislation CRS-3 N. 195 11391053 12-04-92 was also adopted to amend the nurse pay structure established by the Nurse Pay Actof 1990 to replace the 4-grade structure with 5 grades, revise the methodology used forsetting pay levels, require certain nurse pay reports, and make other changes (P.L. 102-585). Other health personnel pay amendments were enacted ss part of P.L. 102-405.Women Veterans. Proposids were adopted to expand health services for womenveterans, particularly services for women who were victims of sexual abuee during theirmilitary service. Provisions contained in Pi. 102-585 authorize the VA to providecounseling to women veterans traumatized as a result of sexual assault (includingsexual harassment) that occurred during active duty service. Women veterans areeligible for counseling within two years of discharge from service or, in the case of aveteran discharged before Dec. 31, 1992, not later than Dec. 31, 1993. The VA isrequired to train health professionals in this area, disseminate information to veteranson the availability of services, and report to Congress on the program. In addition, theVA is authorized to provide certain health services to women veterans, such as papsmears and breast exams; to report on research and services related to health care forwomen veterans; to appoint coordinators of women's health care in each regional office;and to study the health needs of women veterans.Homeless Veterans. Several proposals to expand VA services to honeless veteranswere enacted into law. PL. 102-405 contains provisions to require the VA to assesshomeless programs operated by its hospitals and replicate those considered effective inreintegrating homeless veterans into the community. In addition, VA hospital directorsare required to assess the needs of homeless veterans living within each hospitalcatchment area, determine the extent to which their needs are being met, and, incoordination with other public and private officials, develop a plan to coordinatehomeless services among public and private programs. P.L. 102-405 also extended thehomeless chronically mentally ill (HCMI) program through FY1994 and authorized $50million for both the HCMI and the VA domiciliary homeless care programs for FY1993.In addition, a proposal to demonstrate comprehensive homeless service centers wasadopted as part of P.L. 102-590. The measure also required the placement of VAbenefits counselors in various VA homeless program sites. In addition, it authorizeda new program of grants to nonprofit organizations to conduct outreach and providetraining, counseling and transitional housing services to homeless veterans. Grants arefor acquiring, expanding, or renovating facilities, rather than for services. Granteesreceive per diem payments equal to 50% of the colt for services provided to veterans.The House Appropriations Committee, in its FY1993 VA appropriations bill report,directs the VA to conductstudy on alternatives for housing homeless veterans inabandoned Federal facilities and to report on progress in meeting the needs of homelessveterans (H.R. provisions,including a requirement that VA develop a plan to expand and improve treatmentprograms and outreach activities for veterans suffering from PTSD, and report toCongress on the plan within 6 months of enactment.Transitional Housing.

Fuchs. Washington, Congressional Research Service,Updated Regularly. 12 p.fiLIMALSBXAmericans traditionally have relied on employers for their health insurance.However, in 1991, of the 35.4 million Americans without health insurance, 84% wereemployed or lived in families of workers. Rising health care costs and changingconditions in the private health insurance market may be leading to a decline inemployer-provided coverage.Employer-provided health insurance has taken center stage in the congressionaldebate over health care reform. At present, the Federal Government does not requireemployers to offer or pay for health insurance coverage for their employees or theiremployees' families. However, as a result of past actions by Congress, employers whooffer health insurance have to conform to specific requirements affecting the nature oftheir health insurance plans and the entitlement to those plans. Mandating thatemployers provide coverage is viewed by many in Congress as the beet way to achievecoverage of uninsured workers and their families. It builds upon the existing employer-based health insurance system, and expands coverage in a way that does not explicitlyrequire significant new spending by the Federal Government.Many bills introduced in the 102nd Congress would have required employers toprovide health insurance to their workers and their dependents or pay a contributionto a public program that would insure uncovered workers and others not connected tothe workforce. Additional funds to support the public program would be raised fromtaxpayers.This approach is referred to as 'play or pay.' It is a variation of themandated employer approach in which employers are required to provide and largelypay for a basic health insurance plan for their employees and their employees' families.A smaller nuniber of bills introduced in the 102nd Congress required employers to offera basic health benefit plan but not to pay for it. President Clinton's campaign plan fornational health care reform would phase in a requirement on employers to provide basicinsurance.Substantial controversy surrounds the play or pay approach and employer mandatebills more generally.Proponents argue that providing health insurance is anen.ployer's responsibility. They say that the costs of providing care to uninsuredworkers are being shifted by health care providers to those employers who provide andpay for health insurance. Those who favor the play or pay approach say that it leuensthe costs and administrative burdens of the mandate for smaller employers and otheremployers that otherwise could not afford to purchase insurance. Opponents arguethat it is not an employer's reaponsibility to provide health insurance, but instead theresponsibility of the individual or the Government. They say that many employers,especially smaller ones, cannot afford to offer insurance, even under play or payapproaches.Opponents also argue that the added costs of mandatory coverage(whatever its design) would lead to increased unemployment, especially of low-wageworkers, and would reduce their ability to compete with other employers, in this andother countries.Only one employer-mandate bill, an amended version of S. 1227, had been votedout of committee by the close of the 102nd Congress. But mandated employer coverageis likely to be one of the major health care reform approaches considered by the 103rdCongress. I14,0: 198 1887168 02-02-93 one 'pay or play' bill, an amended version of S. 1227('liselthAmeriere) was voted to be reported out of the Senate Labor and HumanImmures' Committee. No frmther movement occurred. However, requiring mostemployers to provide basic health insurance to their employees was a eore part ofPresident Clinton's campaign proposal to provide secede to health insurance foraffAisseicana. Assuming that it rental= part of the President's reform packagesent to the Congress this spring, an employer mandate will be among the leadingreform options debated by the 103rd Conmat. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISUninsured PopulationIn 1978, about 12.3% of the nonaged (below 65 years old) population did not haveany health insurance. By 1986, the percentage had risen to 14.8%. The percentage ofuninsured held relatively steady through 1990 but jumped to 16% by 1991, pcesibly dueto the ineresee in unemployment resulting from the recession. In 1991, a total of 35.4million Americans were unineured. Low-income households were more likely to lackhealth insurance than those with middle or high incomes, and 84% of the uninsured areemployed or lived in families where the head of the household is employed. (Theseestimates are barred on CRS and Congressional Budget Office analyses of HealthInterview Survey and Current Population Survey data.)The growth in the uninsured over the lest decade may have several causee. First,although the proportion of Americans in the work force has been growing, the percentreceiving health benefits has been dropping. Some analysts attribute this trend toshifts in employment Many of the new job. created in this decade have been in theeervice and nonmanufacturing industries, the sectors least likely to provide coverage.Second, the proportion of the population receiving coverage through anotherfamily member's employment has been dropping. Several factors have contributed tothis decline. A. coverage of primary workers has dropped, so too has coverage of theirdependents. Also, a growing number of workers appear to be electing coverage forthemeelvee and not their dependents. In 1986, workers who were themselves coveredthrough employment failed to cover their spouses in 3% of the cases. About 8% of thechildren of insured workers were uninsured. This reflects in part a decline in employercontributions to the cost of dependent coverage, a trend that is continuing. In 1980,72%.of medium- and large-size firms paid the full costs of coverage for their workers,and 51% paid the full cod of dependent coverage. By 1989, fully paid individualcoverage was available in only 48% of the firms, and fully paid coverage in 31%.Changes have also occurred in family structure; there are more households with older 4CRS-2 BEST COPYAVAILABLE 199 1E187168 02-02-93 children or unrelated individuals. Such family units are less likely to meet thedefinitions in insurance coverage rules.Third, coverage from nonemployment sources declined, particularly MedicaidoDvsrage. In the 1980s, welfare and Medicaid eligibility standards failed to keep pacewith inflation; while the absolute number of people in poverty was rising, the numberof people receiving Medicaid stayed relatively flat. Recent changes in the Medicaidprogram, such as initiatives to cover more pregnant women and children, appear tohave reversed this trend.Insurance status has implications for access to health services. The uninsured areless likely to use health services and are more likely to be in poorer health than theinsured population. The 1986 National Access Survey (done for the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation) reports, for example, that the uninsured had approximately 40%fewer ambulatory visits and 19% fewer hospitalizations than the insured. Of thoseindividuals surveyed who had chronic illnesses, 20% of the uninsured failed to see aphysician or other provider over the course of a year, compared to 17% of the insured.In addition, the uninsured are more likely to delay seeking care; when they seek caze,the ailment may be more serious and coetly to treat. Also, the uninsured rely more onemergency rooms for basic services, experience higher rates of death in hospitals, andare less likely to receive specific procedures (see, e.g., Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, Comparison of Uningured and Privately Insured Hospital Patients, by JackHadley et al., Jan. 16, 1991).Working UninsuredLargely as a result of labor union pressures for better employee benefits, andFederal tax incentives that allow employers to deduct the costs of providing healthbenefits to their employees, employer-related health insurance became increasinglycommonplace after World War 11. Today, after paid vacations, it is the most commonfringe benefit offered by employers. Sixty-four percent of nonaged Americans arecovered by employer-sponsored health plans. As a result (and in contrast to many otherwestern nations where health benefits are provided through government programs),workers in the United States have grown to rely on employer-provided benefits forthesc basic protections. However, as the following statistics reveal, not all employersoffer health benefits and, when offered, not all employees accept them.A CRS analysis of March 1990 CPS data reveals that in 1989, 17.8 millionuninsured workers reported no coverage from an employer plan. Another 10.6 millionuninsured were dependents of workers. The majority of uncovered workers are lowwage earners. The Employee Benefit Reoearch Institute (EBR1) reports that in 1988,89% of all uninsured workers earned lesa than $20,000; 66% earned less than $10,000.Almoot 30% of uninsured workers earned less than what war then the Federalminimum wage.Workers in certain employment 'lectors are much more likely to lack healthinsurance coverage than the average American worker under age 65. These includeworkers in agriculture; retail trade; services (business, repair, entertainment andpersonal); and construction. Workers in other employment sectors (includingmanufacturing, finance, transportation, and wholesale trade) lack insurance coverage CRS-3 200 1E87168 02-02-93 only one-third to one-half as often as workers in the shove employment sectors. Thelikelftzood of being insured under an employer plan also increases with firm size, andbeing self-employed. According to EBRI, in 1988, elope to 50% of uninsured workerswere employed ov salf-employed in firms with fewer than 25 employees.History of Federal Employer MandatesRequirements on Existing Employer PlansThe Federal Government has traditionelly left the regulation of insurance(including rules relating to rating, benefit content, marketing, and solvency) t..) theStates. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) a Federal lawpreempts States from regulating employee welfare benefit plans. Thus, whereasthe States regulate ineurers, it is the Federal Government that regulates employers andtheir health plans. (Hawaii is an exception. ER1SA was amended to allow Hawaii tocontinv- its law requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage.) Includedunder employee welfare benefit plans are self-insured (also known as self-funded) healthplans, where the employer assumes all or some of the risk for paying claims, instead ofpaying premiums to an insurance company which in turn assumes the risk.Accordingly, if an employer purchases insurance, the insurance is regulated by theState. The plan itself is regulated by ER1SA. If the wmployer self insures the plan, itis solely regulated under ER1SA. Plans that are regulated under ER1SA must complywith notification, discloaure, and fiduciary standards. ERISA does not regulate thebenefit content of plans. This means that self-insured employers are relatively free tostructure their plans as they desire, of if their employees are represented by a union,through the collective bargaining process. As discussed below, however, both self-insured and insured health employer plans have to comply with specific Federalrequirements.For example, the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-222)requires that certain employers with 25 or more employees offer a health maintenanceorganization (HMO) option in their health plan if a qualified HMO exists in their area.In 1978, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act to extend the prohibition against sexdiacrimination in employment to include discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions (P.L. 95-555). As a result, larger employer healthplans must treat women affected by these conditions similarly to other employees, basedon their ability or inability to work.In the 1980e, two other major sets of Federal requirements were imposed onemployer health benefit plans: the health insurance continuation requirements underTitle X of COBRA and the Medicare secondary payer requirements. In the first case,the passage in April of 1986 of Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act (COBRA), marked a major departure in Federal law and regulationof employers' welfare benefit plans. It was the first time that the Federal Governmentmandetedspecific benefit in employee welfare benefit plans. While COBRA does notmandate that employers provide health insurance, it does require that empllyers with20 or more employees who do provide health benefits offer qualified employees andtheir families the option of continued health insurance for certain periods of time atgroup rates when faced with lois of their coverage because of certain qualifying events,such as termination or reduction in hours of employment, and death, divorce, and other L.CRS-4 201 IB87168 02-02-93 changes in family status.(See CRS Issue Brief 87182,Private Health InsuranceContinuation Coverage,by Beth C. Fuchs.)A different type of employer mandate was legislated through changes in theMedicare program and amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of1967. Before 1982, employers generally used Medicare coverage as the basic healthinsurance for their Medicare-eligible employees tupplemented by an employer-providedpolicy which filled in gaps in the Medicare coverage. This tended to ensure that healthcare costs for their older workers were confined to supplemental as oppcsed to basichealth care coverage. In 1982, as part of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act(TEFRA, P.L. 97-248), Congress adopted a proposal by the Reagan Administration torequire that private employers with 20 or more employees offer their employees andtheir employees' spouses, age 65-69, their health insurance plan, which would be theprimary payer for all claims. The goal was to reduce Medicare expenditures by shiftingthe health care coots of older workers onto employers. The 'working aged' or'secondary payer' requirement was expanded through Act of 1984 (DEFRA, P.L. 98-369) expanded the spousal coverage to includeall beneficiaries 65-69 with working spouses under age 65. COBRA, (P.L. 99-272) madeMedicare benefits secondary to those payable under employer group plans for employedindividuals age 65 or over, and the spouse. age 65 or older, of any employed individualregardless of am. OBRA of 1986 (P.L. 99-509) included a Reagan Administrationproposal requinng employers with 100 employees or more to offer their disabledworkers and their spouses the option of coverage under their employers' health planas the primary insurance policy. OBRA 90 (P.L. 101-608) extended current Medicaresecondary payer provisions and lengthens a current law secondary payer requirementrelating to end-stage renal disease beneficiaries.Move Toward Federally Mandated Health Insurance CoverageWhile Title X of COBRA and other Federal requirements affect the nature ofemployer-sponsored health plans, they do not require employers to provide healthinsurance to their employees or their employees' families. The idea of requiringemployers to provide and largely pay for their employees' health insurance wasincorporated in a Nixon Administration proposal for achieving expanding access tohealth care, called the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan (CHIP). The Nixonproposal was developed to compete with national heelth insurance proposals whichrelied heavily on the public financing and provision of insurance. Neither the employermandate or public program approach attained sufficient support to be enacted. TheCarter Administration also developed legislation to require employers to provide baaichealth insurance as an employee benefit. Like the NIcon plan, it would have alsoexpanded Federal programs to include those who remain uncovered under employerplans. The Carter proposal wax criticized by representatives of small business whoargued that requiring them to provide insurance would add significantly to their laborcosts and threaten their viability. It also fell victim to an absence of consensus amonghealth policy makers.Improving access to health insurance reemerged as a major health issue in the100th Congress. Faced with large Federal budget deficits and an apparent diminishedinterest in Government-financed solutions, many in Congress turned to employers asa potential source of expanding access to health insurance coverage. In the 100th and101st Congresses, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee marked up and CRS-6 202 IB87168 02-02-93 reported favorably to the full Senate bills (S. 1265 and S. 768 respectively) that wouldhave required moat employers to provide basic health insurance to their employees andtheir employees' families. These bills were strongly opposed by small and many largebusbies's' and were never considered by the Senate or the House. Opposition alsocame from those who favored other approaches to expanding coverage.In the 102nd Congress, expansion of employer-based ineurance throuei a mandateon employers continued to be favored by many as a way to achieve improved coverageof workers and their families. S. 2114, for example, would require employers to providebasic health care to employees. Employers that fail to provide coverage would be fined850 a day per eligible employee. However, moat propose/a (including S. 1177, S. 1227,HR. 2535, H.R. 3206, and HR. 5050) adopted a variation of the mandated approachreferred to as \"play or pay.\" Under this approach, employers would be required to payfor basic health coverage for workers and their families or to pay a tax (usually basedon a percentage of payroll) which, in turn, would be uaed to provide health insurancebenefits to uncovered persons through public program. Hearings were hal on theae proposals in both the House and Senate, but only one bill made it through fullcommittee. On Jan. 22, 1992, the Senate Labor and Human Remources Committee voted10-7 to report an amended version of S. 1227 to the full Senate.An employer-based approach to expanding coverage is likely to be one of thereform options given serious consideration in the 103rd Congress. This is especiallylikely since President Clinton has embraced mandated employer provided healthineurance as part of his plan to achieve universal coverage. Under the Clinton plan (asdeveloped during the campaign), employers would be phased in under a requirement toprovide coverage to their workers and dependents. Subsidies and pooling programswould offset the coats for small firms. Publicly sponsored insurance pools (known ashealth insurance purchasing cooperatives or HIPCs) would offer a choice of privateinsursnce plans for those persona not covered by employer health plans.Issues Related to MandatingEmployer-Provided Health InsuranceThe debate over mandated employer-provided health insurance raises questionsabout the potential economic effects of mandates on employers, on employees' wagesand salaries, and on the national economy. These questions are especially significantin respect to the effect of mandated coverage on small employers. The debate alsoraises philoeophical issues such as the nature of an employer's obligation to his or heremployeNt and whether it is appropriate for the Federal Government to require thatemployers offer insurance.Issues for Small EmployersAs noted earlier, the likelihood that an employer will offer health benefitsincreases with firm size.According to a 1989 survey of employers by the HealthInsurance Association of America, 26% of firma with fewer than 5 employees offeredhealth benefita. This compares with 54% for firms with 5 to 9 employees, 72% for firmawith 10 to 24, 90% for firms with 25 to 49, 97% for firms with 50 to 99, and 99% offirma with 100 or more employees. Of the employed uninsured, 50% worked for firmswith fewer than 25 employees. CRS-6 203 rB8'7168 02,02-93 It is often stemmed that smaller employers are less likely to offer health benefits becaum of the high costs of premiums (generally higher than for large firms), administrative burdens, and the perception that workers prefer mph eag 3 to benefits. animates place the costs of immure's= for small employers at anywhere front 10% to 40% higher than for large employers.Researchers have concluded that smaller employers tend not to offer healthinsurance becauee they: (1) face higher per-worker premiums since the risk for insurers is spread over fewer persona; (2) do not benefit to the same extent as larger firms from the tax advantages emaciated with offering health insurance; (3) experience higher fixed costs in choosing and administering a health plan; (4) have relatively higher worker turnover rates and a greater use of part-time and semanal employees, which increase their administrative fess relative to the fees charged for larger firms; and (5) tend to have narrower profit margins from which to pay relatively higher premiums. The bottom line may be, however, that many small employers do not offer health insurance because they do not need to do so to attract end retain employees.Associations representing small employe= argue that forcing small employers to offer health insurance will result in higher prices, lower wages, more business failures and fewer jobs. They say that a mandate would increaae the costs of labor to the point where companies, especially smaller ones, would reduce wages, or in the cue of firm with minimum and low-wage workers, reduce their labor force. Health insurance is a relatively expensive benefit. Private sector surveys report that in 1990, health benefits cast on average over $3000 per employee. For the 30% of unineured workers who are paid less than the minimum wage (bleed on 1968 EBR1 figures), the added hourly cost of a health insurance benefit could be prohibitive, even if the employee were required to pay a share of the premium. Although a mandated insurance package might be less comprehensive and therefore less expensive than the average private sector policy, it could still produce reductions in the employment of low wage workers as employers attempt to adjust to higher labor coats. But it should be noted that there is subetantialdebate over whether mandated coverage would reault in reductions in employment. While some analysts say that a mandate on employers to provide insurance would result in a significant decline in jobs across the economy, others say that any such job losses would be largely offeet by the creation of new jobs resulting from the increased demand for health care services.Another argument used against mandated coversge for small employers is that low-wage workers prefer to receive cash benefits or are already covered indirectly through a family member's ineurance policy, and should not be forced to accept reduced earnings. This contention is eomewhat supported by surveys of employers.Many proponents of mandated coverage agree that small employers might be adversely affected if they were required to offer (as well as pay some portion of) health insurance. They suggest, however, that potential problems for small employers could be reduced through mechanisms designed to lower the costa and/or the administrative burdens of offering health insurance. For example, the cost of mandated coverage could be partly or fully offset by tax credits for firma for which the mandate creates a financial hardship. Tax credits, however, are likely to require a significant loss in Federal revenues, especially if health care cods continue to rise at their present rates. CRS-7 204 1E87188 02-02-93 Another possibility for lessening the adverse effects on smaller employers is toallow employers to pay less than would be required if they had to purchase theinsurance in the marketplace. This is the rationale for the 'play or par approachdescrilied above. The cost of the mandate to the employer would then depend on theamount of the payroll contribution or tax required by the law. Employers that couldbuy health insurance for their workers for less than the payroll tax would presumablymake that choice. Employer* that found the contribution to be less than the cost ofinsurance would choose to pity. However, any cost, whether it be to play or pay, maybe viewed by many employers as too high.Another pomibility would be to encourage the pooling of large numbers of smallemployers in one large group, thus enabling them to obtain health insurance at lowerccets. Pooling mechaniams have been employed with mixed success. (For more onpooling, see Insuring the Uninsured: Options and Analysis, by the Health InsuranceTeam. Congressional Research Service. Washington. 1988.)Question of Employer ResponsibilityProponents of mandatory employer-provided health insurance argue thatemployers have a basic obligation to ensure that their employees have access to healthinsurance just as they have an obligation to provide a living wage. They assert that aminimum health benefits law should be established in the same manner as the FederalGovernment has established a minimum wage law. They say that it will ultimatelylower the nation's health bill because more people will have timely access to healthcare. PePpie will seek care when they first need it and not wait until their illness ordisability requires heroic and expensive treatment. In addition, they argue thatrequiring employers to provide coverage is in keeping with the nation's heavy relianceon employment-related insurance. They further assert that relying on private ratherthan government-provided ineurance builds on the American tradition of providinghealth insurance through a competitive marketplace.Proponents also argue that this approach will increase equity across employers andtaxpayers. According to a CRS ,snalysis (based on March 1990 CPS data), 23 millionworking Americans receive coverage through employers for whom they are not directlyworking. In addition, health insurance premiums are priced to include not only thedirect cost of providing health care services to an employer's workers, but also othercoets borne by the providers of health care for uninsured or underinsured individuals,a substantial portion of which are uninsured workers. Consequently, employers whoare paying for health care coverage for their employees are subsidizing those employerswho are not paying for coverage as well as subsidizing the costs of care for thenonworking uninsured. On the other hand, individuals who are not offered insuranceby their employers are not benefiting from the $46 billion (FY1993) in favorable taxtreatment received by employees in firms that provide health benefits. (See CRS Report90-507, Taxation of Employer-Provided Health Benefits, by Beth Fuchs and MarkMerlis. Oct. 2, 1990.)Opponents of mandatory employer-provided health insurance counter by arguingthat employers have no inherent obligation to provide health benefits. They assert thatthe individual hasresponsibility to purchase insurance in the private market. Forthose individuals who cannot afford to pay for health insurance, then the public sectorshould provide a minimum level of health care. They argue that an employer's decision CRS-8 205 rogues 02.02-93 to provide insurance cc to revile a specific set of hseith benelits should not be dictated by the Government.Hither, it is lebormatisgement negotiations or free-market competition among insurers vying for employees' badness that should determine whether employers provide insurance and if so what health services should be covered under the policy. Health insuranee is just one form of compensation and it I. up to employers and employees to &wide how total compensation will be provided. Such reliance on the marketplace will also ensure greater efficiencies in the supply and demand of health coverage and services, thus helping to hold down costs.There are also those who reject mandates because they would, in their view, undermine the voluntary nature of maployer-peovided health imurance. They argue that the majority of emplores already provide coverage; it isbenefit that these employers have privet* chosen to provide in a forn that is most appropriate to their own employees. Some employers who already insure their employees argue that a Federal law mandating that employers provide insurance (psrticularly if that law were to require a basic minimum level of benefits) would remit in /deur employee benefit costa and new administrative burdens.Mandated Employer-Provided Insurance and CompetitivenessIn addition to the debate about employer respoosibility, there isdifferent set of imues relating to the potential effects of mandating benefits on employers' ability to compete in domestic and world markets. Much of the analyses of these effects is speculative; however, the basic arguments tend to be articulated aa follows.Opponents say that mandated insurance would drive up the coat of doing business and reduce the ability of firms to compete, both in the domestic and world markets. Industries that compete against foreign manufacturers (especially those from certain Third World nations) are competing spinet employers who do not as a rule provide health and other fringe benefits. This helps foreign manufecturers to hold their prices down. Small employers, especially, believe that mandating health insurance coverage might cause them to loft whatever competitive edge they may have since they would have to offset the cost of tbe new benefits by raising their prices. While msny smaller firms do not directly engege in international trade, some proportion of them are suppliers to large compenies that do compete internationally. Higher costs for a supplier affect the coots of the purchseing firms: if health insurance coverage were required, email employers might pees the cost of the coverage onto their clients. This reasoning is also extended to domestic competition.Proponents of mandated coverage dismiss the competitiveness argument as invalid or not compelling. In their eyes, it is not a real issue because the companies that are etruggling to maintain their competitive edge (such m the auto manufacturers) are the very companies that alreedy provide health insurence. The majority of the working uninsured are not found in the transportation and manufacturing industries but in the service and retail trade indusn-ies, which are comparatively unaffected by foreign competition.It is these latter industries that have expe: enced the mote growth. Mandated coverage proponents conclude that there ye more .0aitiad variables undermining American competitiveness than the coat so American firms of their employee benefit packages. 206 IB87168 02-02-93 Some economists believe both sides are wrong. They argue that employers do notcover their health care coots by raising the price of their products but instead byreducing workbre wages or constraining wage increases. Accordingly, newly mandatedcoverage would hurt workers' income and not the ability of employers to compete indomestic or world markets.\"Play or Pay OptionSimilar arguments are made for and against employer mandates that take the formof 'play or pay; where the employer would be required to provide health insurance orpay a contribution, usually to a public (Government) program, which would in turnprovide coverage to those without employer-provided insurance. Typically, theproposals to establish a play or pay requirement on employers also provide for ataxpayer subsidy of the carts of the public program. This keeps the contribution rate(i.e., the tax on the employer's payroll) for those who choose to pay to a lower levelthan would otherwise be necessary. 'Proponents of play or pay say that it wotuld softenthe impact of a mandate.Assuming that the contribution rate were *et at anappropriate level, employer, with low-wage work forces might therefore fmd it lessexpensive to ply the contribution than to provide the insurance. In addition, they saythat tax credits and other forms of subsidies could be used to lessen the adverse effectsof the contribution on employers.Opponents of `play or paf say that the economic burden of the contribution onmany employers, especially smaller firma, would still be substantial. The contributionrate would be a tax on their business; even if it were less than the cost of buyinginsurance, it would still drive up the cost of labor. The economic burden of thecontribution on puny employers, especially smaller Erma, would still be mbetantial.Moreover, they contend that the contribution rate would have to be steadily increasedin order to prevent rising numbers of employers from choosing to pay into the publicprogram and dropping their insurance plans. (The logic of this argument is based onan assumption that private insurance should retain a significant role in a universalhealth insurance program, and that the public program should not become the primarysource of coverage for workers and their families.)Types of Mandated Coverage ProposalsA variety of approaches to mandating coverage are incorporated in legislation thathas been introduced in recent years. While moct are aimed at expanding access to basichealth insurance by mandating that employers provide health coverage, others seek alsoto define the nature of the benefits to be offered. As noted above, bills in the 102ndCongrees would require employers to provide insurance or pay a percentage of payroll(see, bill, S. 2114, requires employers to provide basic health care to employees or paya tax penalty for the period out of compliance. Other proposals would require thatemployers offerminimum benefit package but not have to pay for it (me KR. 1230and H.R 1565). Some proposals modify Title X of COBRA to extend the duration ofcontinuation coverage for certain populations (see CRS Issue Brief 87182). In pastyears, proposed bills would have required employers already offering insurance to offerspecific benefits, such ss well-baby care. Ar;CRS-10 0 207 1E07168 02-02-93Defining the Application, Nature and Scope of Mandated CoverageShould a mandate apply to all earMoyers, and if not, where should the limits bedrawn? The Medicare working aged and COBRA Title X provisions exempt employerswith fewer than 20 employees, although the OBRg of 1986 Medicare working disabledprovisions apply to only those employees with 100 or more employees. Congress hasbeen wary of applying mandates to smaller employers largely became of concerns that they are not as molly absorbed by mach fines and could create economic hardships.Congress hes also excluded the reciting Government and religious organizations fromcertain provisions. However, exemptions of small firms or other types of employerscould leave many people uninsured, especially if the mandate were not combined with expanded public insurance.The debate over mandated heath insurance coverage is influenced by concerns about the lack of coverage and concerns thet working Americans are not adequately protected against the costs of a catastrophic Mmes. Consequently, there have beenproposals in the past to require that employers provide basic hospital and medicalinsurance as well as them that would manaste only cataetrophic illness protmtion.Another issue is whether the mandate show/ I speeby the nature of health benefits tz be offered by employer.. Agnin, the proposals vary in their approach. Some, such as 102nd Congrem bills ILL 2525, S. 1177, and S. 1127, would require a noir imum level of benefits in the health ineurance package. In S. 1227, an actuarial equivalencyprovision would allow employers to offer different nixes of benefits and employeecost-sharing requirements. Another approach would be to leave the benefit packageumpecified or to require that the benefit package total to a specific actuarial value.There have also been nerrowly defined precool. that mandate that employers who already provide health insurance include within their benefit package specific services,such as coverage for pediatric preventive Wealth care. (See S. 968 and Hit 1449, in the 100th Congress.)Defining the Population to be Covered and the Duration of CoverageIf a mandated approach were pursued, it would be necessary ta define thebeneficiaries who would reoeive the mandated health coverage. The employer's responsibility could be limited to active full-time employees, or expanded to include any or all of the following: pert-bine, seasonal, or retired employees, spouses, widowedand/or divorced spouses, dependent family members, and employees who haveterminated their employment, &Aber voluntarily or involuntarily. Title X of COBRAprovides an example of a broad definition of beneficiaries. H.R. 3393 (102nd Congrese)illuetrates where an employer 'pay or play' requirement is limited to coverage for pregnant women and children.In the same vein, some proposals are directed at ensuring that employers offerhealth benefits beyond the point at which the employee (and his/her dependents) has an immediate connection with the employer. In the past, Congress has consideredproposals to require that employers pay for the continued group coverage of laid-off employees for a defmed period of time. In this case, the benefit package may or may not be defined. Such continuation of coverage mandates may extend to laid-off or otherwise terminated employees, retirees of the firm and dependent spouses and dependents of such employees. CRS-11 208 1B87168 02-02-93 Defining the Liability of Employees and EmployeesMandated coverage bills also generally define the limita of tbe employer's financialobligation to pay for those benefits. In Title X of COBRA, Congress authorizedemployers to require the employe* to pay for the continued health coverage, plus asmall fee to cover the employer's administrative coats. A few 102nd Congress bills (Hlt.1230, H.R. 1565) adopted a mandated offering approach in which employers would btrequired to offer. but_not contribute to a basic package of health benefits. In otherproposals, the focus is to keep the employee's costs for coverage low by requiringemployers to pay a large portion of the premium. For example, S. 1227 would requirethat the employer pay 80% of the employee's insurance premium which in turn wouldbe deductible from the employer's taxes am a cost of doing business. The premiums oflow-income employees would be subeidized by the public plan. H.R. 2563, in the 101stCongress, would have prohibited employers from reducing their premium shares forcertain part-time workers.Under the various 'play or pay\" proposals, an fmancial obligation forproviding health benefits would also be detennin<K1 by the level of the contributionrequired of those employers who decide not to provide insurance to their employees andtheir employee's families. 'Play or pay' bilb in the 102nd Congress generally left thecontribution rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services. However, H.R. 2535 provided that if the Secretary doe* not set thepercent, it would be set at 7% of payroll. H.R. 3205 set the initial payroll tax at 9% ofthe Medicare wage base and then indexed it for inflation.Legislation I a the 102nd CongreasThe HealthAmerica bill (S. 1221) wss introduced by Senator Mitchell June 5, 1991,titled HealthAmerica: Affordable Hesilth Care for All Americans Act. The bill wouldhave amended the PHS Act, the SSA, and the MC to require that 6 years afterenactment, almost all employers would provide qualified health benefits to theiremployees and their employees' families or contribute to a public program (AmeriCare)a percent of payroll. The 'play or pay' requiremeut would have been phased-in, withthe requirement affecting employers with over 100 employees in the second full yearafter enactment. Employers that provide health benefits would have to pay 80% of thepremium (the premiums of low-income employees' could be subsidized by AmeriCare).The bill provided for minimum standards to make insurance sold to smaller firms moreaccessible and included cost containment and other provisions. It was referred to theCommittee on Finance. Hearings were held Sept. 30, 1991 by Finance Subcommitteeon Health for Families. An amended version was voted to be reported by the SenateLabor and Human Resources Committee on Jan. 22, 1992. LEGISLATIONmg. 30 (Grandy)Health Care Empowerment and Access Legislation.

Such billswere backed by many Democrats and someRepublicans, who claim thst affordablehealth care for all is beet achieved by end-ing the complexity and inefficiency result-ing from our current system of multipleinsurers, private and public, each with theirown eligibility requirements, benefit pack-ages, provider payment rules, and adminis-trative expense. Single-payer bills will becompeting with other reform approaches inthe 103rd Congress (managed competition,tax approaches, etc.), each potentially pro-ducing different distributional effects onaccess and cost.Proposals bearing the label 'singlepayer' take a variety of forms. Wet com-monly, the term is used to descrilse sys- tem in which the government would spon-sor and pay for health care for all; often,such single-payer plans rely on broadhasedtaxes. Payments to providers are regulatedand flow through a single pipeline; system-wide limits on spending may be imposed.Existing public insurance programs are sub-sumed under the new program; privateinsurance is eliminated or operated only tocover services not inured under the gov-ernment plan. The system would be imple-mented at the national or State level, orthrough a Federal-State partnership. In the parlance of today's debate, it is the'Canadian approach? Other proposals use'single payer' to desenle system in whichframework is established for one Federalor State payer but other insuring entities(such as HMOs) are found as well.Single-payer approaches are supportedby some consumer and physician groupsand some employers and unions. Propo- nents say that moving to a single-payer,public inourance program covering allAmericans would save billions of dollars inadministratiVe expenses. In addition, theysay it would end the shifting of costs fromone insuring entity to another that current-ly impedes efforts to control spending.Assuming government subsidies of lower-income populations, such a system alsowould ensure universal access to adequateand affordable health insurance, withoutregard to ability ta pay. Opponents arguethat a single-payer system would lead tobureaucratic medicine in which consumerpreferences would give way to governmentpreferences in the determination of whogets what health care. They say it wouldreduce the innovation and diversity thathas helped to bring the U.S. advances inhealth care delivery, technology, and financ-ing. Opponents also claim critical medicalresources would end up being rationed;millions would see their health insurancecoverage deteriorate.Major issues arising with respect tosingle-payer proposals include: the (eetimates greatly vary); the ade-quacy the benefit package; methods forcontaining physician, hospital, and otherprovider costs (proposals differ in the strin-gency of cost controls); methods of contain-ing system-wide expenditures; and wsys tofmanee the system to achieve the preferreddistribution of program costs among con-sumers, employers, and governments.Reprinted from Health Care Service, Updsted'legularly. 12 p. Congressional Reocarcb Service The Library or Congreas 111 210 IB93006 03-08-93 Most Recent DevelopmentsOn March 3, 1993, Rep. McDermott and Senator Wel !stone introduced theAmerican Health Security Act of 1993 (H.R. 1200 and S. 491), a revised version ofRep. Ruaso's 102nd Congress single-payer proposal. The McDermott-Wellstoneproposal is seen by many as the major alternative to employer-based and tax-system options for expanding financial access to coverage. It is also viewed as analternative to managed competition for achieving containment of health care costs.Single-payer proposals will be among those debated by the 103rd Congress as itconsiders ways to achieve health care reform. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSTSMore discussion of health care reform is occurring today than at any time sincethe 1970s. This interest has been fueled by health care spending projected to reachalmost 19% of the national economy by 2000 and rising numbers of uninsured (over 35million in 1991). The public's concerns about unpaid medical bilis, being locked in ajob to maintain health benefits, and escalating insurance premiums have broughtrenewed attention to issues of universal coverage and cost containment. Over 100reform proposals were introduced in the 102nd Congrezr, and health care reform wasa major issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign. President Clinton has said that hewill send a comprehensive reform proposal to Congress later this spring.One reform approach favored by some Members of Congress calls for moving awayfrom our existing system of multiple sources of insurance to a system in which oneentity serves as the insurer of all Americans. This in often called the single-payerapproach. Single-payer bills in the 103rd Congress include, for example, H.R. 16, H.R.1200 and S. 491. In the 102nd Congress, there were also bgis to expand Medicare tocover everyone, a clear variant of the single-payer approach (RR. 650, H.R. 1777).Another set of bills would have established State administered universal insuranceprograms, relying primarily on a single public payer. These included such bills as H.R.16, H.R. 3689, H.R. 6500, S. 1446, S. 2513, and S. 3331. Some of these bills would haveencouraged managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations (IIMOs), asan alternative to the single public plan. Such single-payerproposals will be among theoptions considered by the 103rd Congress as it debates health care reform. Otheroptions, however, including an employer mandate combined with managed competition,appear to be gaining more support both in Congress and within the ClintonAdministration. (Sae FOR ADDITIONAL READING for CRS products covering otherapproaches.)What is the Single-Payer Approach?Americans receive health insurance today from a wide variety of sources, includingover 1200 commercial insurers, about 550 health maintenance organizations (lIMOs),73 Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, self-insured plans operated by private employers, local CRS-1 Aro 211 I593006 03-08-93 and State governments, the Federal-State program for the poor and disabled (Medicaid)and the Federal Government (including Medicare, and the Veterans' Administration andDefense Department programs). Each insuring entity has its own eligibilityrequirements, enrollment procedures, claims processing, and utilization and qualityreview programs, all of which add to administrative expense. For this reason, manypeople describe our system as multipayer or pluralistic.Opponents of the current multipayer system say that the hundreds of differentpublic and private insuring entities needlessly complicate the system and drive up thecost of health care. In their view, reform requires that we streamline the system, thatwe move towards a few entities, or single payer, through which health insurancewould be financed and medical services reimbursed. Such a system, they argue, wouldeffectively contain costs because the single payer would exert monopsony power overprovider payments. If a provider did not like what it was getting, it could not turn toanother payer in the hopes of getting more, as it can in s multipayer system. It wouldalso eliminate duplicate administrative costs.Proposals bearing the label 'single payer' take a variety of forms, and as such, theterm can be more confusing than helpful as a tool of classification. Most commonly, theterm 'single payer' is used to describe an approach in which the government sponsorsand pays for health care for all persons. Everyone gets their basic health insurancefrom the one government sponsored (i.e., public) plan. Typically, rush single-payerplans are financed with revenues generated from income, payroll, and other taxes. Allpayments to hoepitals, physicians, and other providers are regulated and originate withthe government plan. System-wide controls on spending may also be in place. Existingpublic insurance program, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Department of Defenseand Veterans' Affairs programs are subsumed under the new, government program.Private insurance is either ehminated or maintained only to cover services not insuredunder the government plan. 3uch a sint, ...payer approach can be implemented at thenational or State level, or through a Federal-State partnership. In the parlance oftoday's debate, it is the 'Canadian approach.' It is most clearly reflected in such 103rdCongress bills as H.R. 1200 and S. 491 and such 102nd Congress bills as H.R. 650(Stark), H.R. (Sanders), llstone).Some proposals use the term 'single payer' even though more than one entity maybe authorized to play that role. These proposals set up a framework for one Federalor State payer but permit other insuring entities, such as HMOs or large employers,also to act as insurers, so long as they can meet specific requirements. While providersmay receive payment from several sources, the rates of payment are typically set by thepublic insurer. At some point, such 'single-payer' proposals begin to look more like the'all payer approach' reflected by the German health care system, and some State 'allpayer' rate regulation systems iu which insurance companies and employer health plansare required to pay providers using predetermined uniform rates and fees, usually setthrough negotiation with providers. (Examples in the 102nd Congrem include H.R.3205 (Rostenkowski), H.R. 5502 (Stark), and HE. 4889 (Cardin)). There are also proposals that channel the revenues for health insurance through a single entity, suchas the Federal or a State government, but provide insurance through multiple publicand public entities. The Dingell-Waxman bill in ine 102nd Congress (HM 5514) tookthis approach, as does the plan proposed by California's insurance commissioner, JohnGaramendi. CRS-2 212 I593006 03-08-93 This issue brief focuses on single-payer proposals that provide insurance coveragefor all under one public program, which in turn is the main source of payment tophysicians, hospitals, and other providers. It includes plans that are organized at thenational as well as State level. It also includes plans that establish the structure fora single.payer system but permit qualified health insurance arrangements, such asHMOs to , ovide health insurance as well. While single-payer proposals could providefor public ownership of health care facilities and making all physicians and otherproviders employees of the public plan, this b not a requirement. Indeed, all but onebill in the 102nd Congress (H.R. 3229), would have maintained a private deliverysystem.Interest Group ViewsAmong interest groups, universal, single-payer public insurance is supported bysome consumer organizations (Citizen Action, Consumers Unbn, Public Citizen), someprovider organizations (Physicians for a National Health Program, National Associationof Social Workers), and some unions, including the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees. The AFL-CIO has been split, with some membersfavoring comprehensive reform through the single-payer approach, and otherssupporting an employer-based, play-or-pay option. While some representatives of largecorporations have expressed private support for the single-payer approach, organizedcorporate and small business interests (Chamber of Commerce, ERISA IndustryCommittee, National Association of Manufacturers, and National Federation ofIndependent Businesses) are opposed. Also opposed are most provider groups, includingthe American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Health Care Systems,the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the American Medical Association, aswell as organizations representing the insurance industry, including Blue Cross andBlue Shield and the Health Insurance Association of America.Arguments For and Against the Single-Payer ApproachProponents of a single-payer approach use one or more of the following argumentsto support their position:Curb cost-shilling.Current cost containment efforts have not been effectivebecause health care is financed and delivered through a nonsystem of multiple entities,each acting on its own behalf to shift the burdens of controlling costs and ensuringaccess to someone else.If cost constraints are placed on any one entity, such asMedicare, providers seek higher reimbursement from other payers, such as privateinsurers and employers. Under a pure single-payer system, one entity would be vestedwith the authority to determine how much money would flow to providers and to setrates and fees paid to providers within that overall limit. Providers could not seekadditional payments elsewhere because there would be nowhere else to go. (Someproposals might allow providers to bill patients directly, but many prohibit such balancebilling to protect enrollees from potential cost shifts.) r0CRS-3 213 11393006 03-08-93 Streamline administration. Under our current system, billions of dollars ani spenton administration, that is, on transactions between payers, providers, and consumersthat have nothing to do with the actual delivery of medical services. Duplication andoverlap result from the information requirements of multiple organizations; excessivered tape results from different eligibility and coverage rules. Such coats would besubstantially reduced under a single-payer system. One entity would be enrollingbeneficiaries and paying claims. The administrative costs associated with privateinsurance, such as marketing, risk selection (underwriting), and the payment of agentcommissions, would be eliminated. Other costly administrative transactions, such asdata collection for quality assurance and utilization review, could be streamlined andimproved. With only one payer indeed of hundreds, physicians, and other providerswould be subject to more uniform standards of medical review, reducing the intrusionon their clinical decisions. In short, the single-payer approach provides for simplicityof structure and organization that no other approach under discussion can match.Employer-based options, for example, require complex arrangements to ensure thateveryone retains insurance, regardless of work status. (The issue of administrativecosts is discussed in more detail below.)Ensure universal access and continuity of coverage. Today, reliance on employer-based insurance for the majority of Americans leads to gaps in coverage for millions ofworkers and their families. In addition to the millions of uninsured whose employersdo not offer insurance are milliona more who experience temporary losses of coverage as they move in and out ofjobs or on and off medicaid. A single-payer system wouldeliminate the reliance on employment as the principal path to becoming insured. AllAmericans would be covered under a single insurance program, without regard to healthstatus, medical history, linkage to employment, or at least in most bills -- ability to pay. This would also ensure continuity of insurance coverage because changes in jobor family status would not cause interruptions in payment for ongoing services.Provide uniform benefits. Under the current multipayer system, benefit coveragevaries widely. For example, persone covered under large employer group plans typicallyreceive comprehensive benefits, and pay low deductibles and coinsurance. Personscovered under nongroup (i.e., individual) policies typically receive less generous coverage, and pay high deductibles and coinsurance. A single-payer system wouldensure that everyone would be eligible for the same set of basic benefits, provided underthe same set of cost-sharing and reimbursement rules. The source of imurance wouldno longer be a cause of inequality in access to care.End rationing on the boils of ability to pay. Opponents of the single-payer approach argue that it will lead to rationing of medical resources, including hightechnology equipment, thereby reducing access and quality of care. Single-payer proponents respond that health care is already rationed in the U.S. by ability to pay;those who are uninsured get less care and poorer quality services than those who haveinsurance. Under a aingle-rayer program, rationing would be explicit, subject to publicdebate, and independent ofperson's financial status. Also, the US. currently hassubstantial excess capacity of hospital beds, physicians (particularly specialists),technolosy, and unnecessary services. By managing provider payments and the distribution of technology, the single-payer system could achieve universal access and cost containment without having to ration services. CRS-4 214 IB93006 03-08-93 Opponents differ in their arguments against a single-payer approach dependingon their perspective. Some believe that a single-payer plan is desirable but notpolitically feasible; others prefer an alternative approach that builds on our existingsystem of public and private payers, such as mandated employer-provided insurance.Still others prefer to leave the broad sweep of decisions relating to insurance entirelyto the private market. In any case, opponents often suggest single-payer plans would:Bureaucratize health care.Market competition encourages insurers to beresponsive to consumer needs and to provide services as efficiently as possible.Consumers can elect a health plan that best meets their individual needs. A single-payer approach, such as one fashioned after the Canadian system, calls for one largepublic program controlled and administered by government, be it Federal or State.Decisions traditionally left to the market would become centralized and bureaucratic.Consumer preferences would give way to government preferences. Key decisions aboutbenefits and the use of scarce resources would be determined by politicians. Such anapproach stands in striking contrast with Americans' traditional distrust ofgovernment. The public would not accept one government entity making all coverageand payment decisions for 250 million enrollees in a fair, efficient, and accluntablemanner. Moreover, the administrative costs associated with the current muitipayersystem could b,s. substantially reduced without adopting the drastic change required bya single-payer model. Reducing unnecessary paperwork and red tape, streamliningreview and billing procedures, and reforming health insurance rating and underwritingpractices could significantly reduce administrative costs without abandoning ourmultipayer system.Reduce innovation and diversity. The advantage of the existing system of manypayers is that competitive pressures stimulate payers to seek new solutions to access,cost, and quality problems. Employers and employees demand from insurers thatcoverage be comprehensive and allow access to high quality of care. Under a single-payer system, much of this innovation would be lost. In addition, a single-payer systemassumes that -one size fits ails,\" when instead, one size or, in this case, payer, may stifleinnovation, concentrate too much power in one place, and become administratively Encourage rationing of medical care. To contain costs, single-payer systems suchas the Cenadian system have had to resort to blunt and potentially harsh constraintson medical resource supply, including constraints on overall expenditures, limits on theavailability of high technology equipment and services, and limits on physician supply.Such steps are likely to lead to shortages of technology and personnel, and delays in thereplacement of out-dated hospitals and other facilities. This could mean sacrifice inaccess to necessary services, long waits for nonemergency services, and reductions inquality of care.Reduce benefit coverage and jobs. Movement to a single-payer system would resultin enormous dislocations of people. First, millions of Americans who are currentlysatisfied with their health insurance plans would be moved to the new program. Forsome, the move would result in the loaf of benefits they consider important (extendedmental health care or comprehensive dental coverage, for example). Second, while someof the thousands of employees of private insurers might be absorbed by the new single-payer plan, many could face unemployment. Many insurance companies would go outof business; independent insurance agents would lose a major source of their income. CRS-5 215 IB93006 03-08-93Administrative Cost DebateA. noted above, a principal and controversial argument in favor of moving the U.S.to a single-payer syrtem is that the amount of money \"pent on administration wouldbe reduced. Data from other countries, especially Canada, are often used to supportthis claim.Administrative wets are generally defined to include: (1) public and privateinsurance overhead (processing claims, advertising, underwriting, billing, generaloperating overhead, agent commissions, premium taxes paid to States, profit, and any amounts held in reserve to cover unanticipated losses); (2) provider overhead, includingthat of hospitals, nursing homes and physicians (accounting, billing and collection,admitting, public relations, personnel department, data processing, etc); and (3) allother, including the administrative costs associated with running small governmentprograms, manufacturerbrupplier compliance coats, the administrative costs of research,construction, and other public health activities; the costs to employers of administeringhealth plans; and the administrative costs of nonhealth insurance, such as auto insurance, which pays for medical care.A true accounting of these coats is problematic given the limits of currentreporting systems. For instance, reliable national level data on hospital or physicianadministrative costs are unavailable. Also, it is difficult to sort out those provider costswhich are associated with dealing with health insurers from thom that are purely necessary for patient care. The only routinely published national administrative dataare those associated with the administration of private health insurance, $47 billion in1992 (5.8% of the Nation's spending on health care), and the Federal costs ofadministering Medicare and Medicaid, $8 billion in 1992 (less than 1% of total healthspending). (These are Congressional Budget Office CHO estimates, based on HealthCare Financing Adrainigration data.) The expenses incurred by doctors and otherproviders asresult of multiple claims and billing forms and the personnel to take careof them are not reflected in these estimates.In compering administrative cods across health systems, such as the United Stateswith Canada, the task is more complicated. Data comparability is one problem. For example, physician overhead expenses may be reported differently in different countries.Also, analysts differ on how much to assume can be saved by transferring one nation's system to another.If the United States adopts the Canadian model, should it beassumed that it is also adopting its expenditure controls, such as hospital global budgets? And, what costs should be included in the estimate? Danzon (Health Affairs, Spring 1992) has argued that comparing administrative coats of alternative systems byadding up billing coots, insurance overhead, and the like is misleading because it failsto include the hidden costs and benefits associated with financing and operatingdifferent systems. In her view, system based on multiple private insurance plans may cost more because such plans facilitate varying consumer preferences with respect toproviders and delivery syrtems, benefit packages, and cost-sharing. On the other hand,she says, a Canadian-like system wades valuable patient and provider resource' (such as time) by requiring people to wait for nonemergency services. Also, the Canadiansystem's reliance on tax hued financing encourages losses in productivity andinvestment as individuals eeek to avoid taxed activities. Others dispute Denson, sayingshe ignores the actual experience of Canada and other single-payer systems in favor of an ideological preference for a private ineurance market. CRS-6 216 IB93006 03-08-93 Given these controversies, it is not surprising that a wide range of estimates havebeen produced on how much the U.S. could save by moving to single-payer system likethat of Canada. Woolhandler and Himmelstein have concluded that the U.S. wouldhave saved as much as $83 billion had its health care administration been as efficientas that in Canada in 1987. Adjusted for 1991, the amount would have been $95 billion.The General Accounting Office (GAO) has estimated that a Canadian-style systemwould have saved the U.S. $67 billion in 1991. A lower set of estimates include thatof Lewin-ICF ($47 billion), a mint.. ity staff report of the Joint Economic Committee($43 billion); a CEO staff study ($41 billion); and an Office of Management and Budgetstaff estimate of $31 to $49 billion. (Some of these atudies are summarized in Gauthieret al., Inquiry, Fall 1992.)Whatever the magnitude of the savings, moat analysts agree that movement to auniversal, single-payer system would not eliminate all administrative costs. It wouldreduce the direct and indirect colts associated with insurance, such as those associatedwith eligibility determinations, marketing, and processing the large assortment ofclaims and billing forms.It would not eliminate the need for maintaining patientrecords, complying with government regulations, and other administrative tasks thatplay a role in and add to the costs of health care delivery.Major Issues Relating to Single-Payer ProposalsThe debate with respect to single-payer approaches to health system reform raisesquestions about acme, benefit coverage, and quality; cost containment; and financing.The wide variation in treatment of these issues in the various proposals reflectsdifferent objectives and philosophies and would produce substantially differentdistributional effects.Acceis, Benefit Coverage, and QualitySingle-payer proposals generally provide access to insurance coverage to all legalresidents. Some bills phase in access, typically starting with children and sometimesearly (pre-Medicare) retirees. Others provide for a one-time move to universal access.Effective dates for coverage of specific populations are generally linked to financing.As the pool of available revenues grows (either through taxation or savings from costcontainment measures), new populations are made eligible for coverage under theprogram.Single-payer proposals usually provide for coverage of comprehensive acute caresw:vices, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, physician, laboratory and x-ray services, and post hospital care. To this extent, single-payer and 'Medicare-for-all'bills are similar. They tend to diverge with the increasing generosity of the benefitpackage and declining reliance on enrollee cost sharing. Some singie-payer bills alsoinclude prescription drugs, and/or long-term care services. Some provide all coveredservices free to the patient at the time of service, while others require enrollees to sharein the cost of the insurance (see Financing, below).Another benefit design issue is whether a proposal allows consumers to buy privateinsurance duplicating the benefits of the public insurance program. Some believe thatsuch a provision would encourage two-tier health care because those with an ability to CRS-7 217 1139300603-08-93pay would opt for private insurance. Accordingly, some propoeals explicitly prohibit private insurers from selling coverage duplicating publicprogram benefit... A related issue is whether physicians and other providers can receivepayment for services from other than the single-payerentity. Under the Canadianmystem, for example, physicians must decide whether or not they want to participate in the provincial health plan. They cannot accept paymentfrom private insurers if theyreceive provincial plan reimbursement. Thom few that do not participate in theprovincial plans tend to be in specialties providingservices not covered by the plans (e.g., oosmetic plastic surgery). In England, specialists thatare salaried under the National Health Service (NHS) are permitted also to take potients on a fee-for-service basis. Asa reeult, patients with the ability to pay (or whoare privately insured) sometimes pay privately for elective procedures rather than waitfor them under the NHS.Critics claim that this leadsto inequitable access tononemergency care.Most proposals do allowprivate insurers to sell policies that supplement the benefits provided under thepublic program. This would enable consumers to purchase policies, for instance, thatcover so-called amenities, such as private hospital rooms, as well as services that exceedpublic program limits (e.g.extended treatment for mental illness) or are not covered by the public program. The effects of supplemental coverage on total system spending and equity then have to be considered.Quality assurance under the single-payer proposals is inherently linked to the method of paying providers (see Cost Containment, below). But most proposals also include mechanisms aimedat regulating the quality ofservices provided to program enrollees.Several 102nd Congress bills incorporated Medicare quality assurance standards and procedures.Some bills would haveincreased Federal fumling for outcomes research and the development of clinical practice guidelines to make medical services more appropriate and effective. Some charged the States with implementing quality assurancemeasures.Cost ContainmentIn addition to savingson administration achieved by eliminating multiple payers, single-payer proposals generally include other measures aimed at controlling costs. These include: constraintson medical resource supply (e.g., planning and regulation of the distribution of highcost technology, expanded Federal technology assessment, and/or increased Federal funds for outcomes research andclinical practice guideline development); and incentives to encourage more primary care.Potentially most important to coat containment, however, is the manner in which the proposals seek to regulate payments to providers and/or control system-wide health expenditures.Regulating providerpayments. Mott single-payer proposals include controls on the rates (prices) charged by providers. These takea variety of forms. Some proposals call for the use ofMedicare's prospective payment syitem for hospitals and its resource-based relativevalue scale (RBRITS) methodof setting fees for physicians. Others call for the use ofnegotiation processes to set hoapital and physician payment rates. Still others would leave decisions on rate setting toan independent board or to the States. If the bill allowsHMOs to operate as analternative to the publicprogram, capitation payments arepermitted.(Capitation is a method ofpaying for an individual's medical care through a per capita payment that isindependent of the CRS-8 .- 218 I593006 03-08-93 number of services received or the costs incurred by providers in furnishing thoseservices. Capitation rates are typically set in advance of payment.)While rate regulation may help control prices paid to providers, it could encourageproviders to offset price limits by providing an increased quantity and intensity ofservices. If a physician, for instance, cannot charge more than 8100 for a procedure,then he or she may be encouraged to provide more of that procedure or substituteprocedures for which the unit fee is higher in order to maintain his/her expectedincome. In response, some proposals would establish an expenditure target for allphysicians in a State (or other geographical area). If physicians in the aggregate wereto exceed the ceiling, then all physicians would be penalized by receiving a lower thanscheduled annual update in their fees.Some analysts believe that expenditure limits designed in this fashion would notbe very effective in controlling the growth in volume and intensity of services becauseindividual physicians would not see their individual actions directly influencing futurefee schedule adjustments. They believe potentially more effective alternative would beto place an expenditure target or limit on smaller subeets of physicians, such as allphysicians in an area, specialty, or group practice. More effective still might be limitson the fees of individual physicians. In this case, once a physician reached his or herpreset expenditure limit, reimbursement for additional services provided during theremainder of the payment period would be substantially reduced. One concern withthis approach is that it could reduce patient access if physicians responded to reachingtheir expenditure cap by going on vacation or refusing to accept patients requiring alot of time and/or resources.A related cost containment measure is often referred to as global budgeting, andis usually applied to hospitals or other large providers of services. Global budgetsdefine the total resources available for treating all patients and place the responsibilityfor cost containment on the actual providers of care. Accordingly, each hospital,nursing home, clinic, etc. is placed in a position of operating within predeterminedlimits which affects its decisions regarding treatment and resource allocations.Symem-wide (global) expenditure limits. The most expansive cost controlsare those that establish targets or limits on total system-wide health care spending.Under this system-wide target or limit, spending is then limited within each health careoector (usually within each State or geographic region) to an annual amount. Spendingin excess of the limit is penalized by offeetting adjustments in subsequent periods.Important issues then arise with respect to determining how to define and allocatespending within each eector and determining allowable rates of growth. Should, forexample, all physician services be bundled together or separated in some way? Shouldthe expenditure limit take into account general inflation, demographic changes, andchanges in medical practice and technolov, or should it be linked to overall economicmeasures, such as the growth in wages or the growth in the economy?Proponents of system-wide expenditure limits say that limits would help disciplinespending and facilitate predictability and planning in public and private budgeting forhealth care. Resource allocation decisions would neceesarily become explicit politicalquestions, which would encourage the Nation to debate priorities and assess tradeoffs.Opponents say that expenditure limits could lock in existing inefficiencies in thesystem.Besides, they say, we do not have the data to determine how to allocate CRS-9 219 I593006 03-08-93 spending limits.They also argue that it is unrealistic .to expect the limits to beenforced, especially if such decisions lead to rationing of services. Some opponents alsooppose expenditure limits because they would, in their view, replace marketplacedecisions with government controls.FinancingSource. of Financing.Under the current mixture of public and privatefinancing, individuals, governments, and employers share in the burden. Individualsdirectly finance health care costs through premium contributions and out-of-pocketpayments. The insured generally contribute all or a share of the premiums and payout-of-pocket for deductibles, coinsurance, and uncovered services. The uninsured maybear significant out-of-pocket costs for received services.Federal, State and local governments today contribute a major share of the totaldollars spent on health care. The burden of government financing is distributed amongtaxpayers through a mixture of tax levies, including individual and corporate incometaxes, the Medicare payroll tax, excise taxes, and at the State level, property, income,sales and excise taxes.Government also indirectly helps to finance (and thusencourage) employer-provided health insurance through various tax expenditureprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code.Businesses account for the remaining share of total health care expenditures.Much of that cost is incurred providing health benefits for employees and their families,and paying the employer share of the Medicare payroll tax and other payroll taxes thatsupport the medical portion of State-mandated workers' compensation and temporarydisability insurance programs. Some economists assert that employer contributions arereally costs to employees since they are likely to reflect foregone wages. From thisperspective, it could lx said that individuals ultimately finance all of health care in theform of taxes, reductions in wages, increases in prices, and out-of-pocket payments.Proponents of single-payer plans generally believe that we need to move away fromwhat they say is a complex, sometimes hidden, and often regressive way of financinghealth care to a system that is largely financed on broad-based and progressive taxationthat is decided in the open political arena. Opponents tend to argue that such a systemwould lead to highly politicized decision making about how much money to raise andhow the money should be spent. They say that politicians would be unwilling to riskvoter anger to fully finance the system and scarcity of health care resources wouldresult.Financing the Single-Payer Program. Any single-payer initiative will drawon revenues from individuals, government, and/or business, and in so doing, is likelyto alter the current distribution of the financing responsibility. Most single-payerproposals are explicitly designed to spread the responsibility of providing universalcoverage broadly among taxpayers by providing for government financing. Suchproposals generally rely on broad-based taxes, such as personal and corporate incometaxes, as well as payroll taxes, with some financing responsibility left to enrolleesthrough premiums and coinsurance. A consumption tax, such as a value added tax(VAT), is also sometimes accorded a role in such proposals. Some proposals raise partof the revenues through excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco products. Still another 64-300 0938CRS-10 220 1B93006 03-08-93 source of revenues may be State contributions, often set at an amount approximatingthe States Medicaid payments for acute care services.The income tax is generally viewed as the most progressive revenue source becauseit is designed on the basin of ability to pay. Financing health care through aprogressively structured income tax is assumed by many to be the most equitable wayto spread the coat of health care acrou the entire population; moat single-payer billstherefore rely to some extent on increases in Federal income taxes (usually by raisingrates on higher-income taxpayers). Others believe that higher users of health careshould have to pay more, especially those with high risk behaviors, such as smokers anddrinkers. Opponents of an income tax-supported system argue it would lose out incompetition with other government programs for needed funding, especially if therevenues were not dedicated to a health insurance trust fund. In another vein, somesay that financing health insurance through increases in Federal income taxes ispolitically unfeasible because of general voter opposition to tax increases. Proponentsrespond that voters would accept tax increases to finance a universal health insuranceprogram if they were persuaded that other financing options were less desirable.Payroll taxes also are used to finance many of the single-payer proposals. Suchtaxes are typically levied at a flat rate on wage income, usually up to some dollarceiling, and are thought to be more regressive for workers because wage income is asmaller fraction of total income at higher income levels. Payroll taxes may also penalizelabor intensive industries in favor of capital intensive ones. A variety of measures canbe used to reduce the regressivity of payroll taxes, such as basing a portion of theemployer contribution on profits instead of payroll. Consumption taxes are usuallyconsidered to be neutral with respect to labor or capital intensity of firms. Becausethey are levied at a flat rate and because lower-income people use more of their incomefor consumption than savings, they are regarded by many as regressive. They can bemade less regressive depending on which items are exempted from the tax and whetherother tax mechanisms are used to offset their effects on income.Direct consumer financing in the form of enrollee premiums and/or cost sharingalso is used in most of the single-payer proposals. Premiums tend to be scaled toincome to limit their potential regressivity. Some bills use premium, to finance specificbenefits, such as long-term care. Cost-sharing is included in some bills but is generallywaived for certain services, such as prenatal and well-baby care. Proponents ofconsumer cost-sharing say that it is important to sensitize consumers to the cost ofservices and to discourage unnecessary utilization. Opponents say that it mostlydiscourages low-income enrollees from seeking services but has little effect on those ofgreater means, that it may deter necessary as well as unnecessary care, and that it dotslittle to alter the course of care once treatment has begun because the decision-makinghas shifted to the physician.

Many such billswere introduced in the 102nd Congress anda program of tax credits and deductions wasthe cornerstone of President Bush's healthcare reform plan. Tax-based measures werepart of President Clinton's campaign pro-posal for health care reform and may beincluded in the health care reform proposalhe sends to Congress later this year.Under current law, the Federal Gov-ernment provides incentives to employers tofurnish health insurance by treating thecost of inaurance as a deductible businessexpense and by excluding employer-provid-ed benefits from taxable employee income.In addition, individuals may deduct medicalexpenses, including health insurance premi-ums, to the extent to which those expensesexceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Low-income families may also receive a taxcredit for part of the coats of purchasingcoverage for children. In 1993, the reduc-tion in F- teral revenues resulting from theindividu... medical expense deduction andthe exclusion of employer-provided benefitsfrom employees' taxable income will totalclose to $50 billion.Proposals to modify the current taxtreatment of health insurance have arisenin the context of the broader debate overhow to provide health coverage to theuninsured (35.4 million in 1991) whilecontrolling the growth in national healthspending, projected to reach $808 billion, or13.6% of gross domestic product, in 1992.Tax system changes may serve either ofthese two broad objectives. On the onehand, enhancement of exirting deductionsand c-edits could encourage individuals topurchase coverage or employers to provideit to their workers. On the other hand,limits on the favorable tax treatment al-ready provided for health coverage couldencourage restraint in personal healthspending. While the two goals appear to bein conflict, many proposals embody bothapproaches, using savings from limiting taxbenefits for some individuals in order toexpand tax benefits for others.Thiapproach isfound, forexample, in plans developed by the HeritageFoundation, Mark the AmericanEnterpriee Institute (AEI), and several102nd and 103rd Congresa bills. Someproposals view changes in the tax system asa way of restructuring incentives for healthcare consumers and providers. This ap-proach is a central component of some ofthe *managed competition' plans now underdiscussion, such as the *Jackson andConservative Democratic Forum plans.Changing consumer incentives is also im-portant to proponents of medical savingsaccounts (MSAs), but with a different in-surance market resulting than that envi-sioned under managed competition.Two tax initiatives were incorpo-rated in bills passed by the 102nd Congressbut vetoed by President Bush. One wouldhave extended the 25% deduction for self-employed businesaes.The second wouldhave allowed withdrawals from individualretirement accounts (IRAs) to pay for quali-fied medical expenses without incurring atax penalty. Both are likely to be reconsid-ered in the 103rd Congress. Congressional Research Service The Library of Congress 4r,.() 223 IB93002 02-19-93 Most Recent DevelopmentsPresident Bush vetoed H.R. 11, the Revenue Act of 1992, effective Nov. 5, 1992.This legnlation contained provisions extending tbe 25% health insuranoededuction for the self-employed (which expired June 30, 1992) and allowingpenalty-free withdrawals from Individuid retirement accounts for medical expenies.Many bills to restore the 26% deduction and/or inCTOYO it tO 100% have beenintroduced in the 103rd Congress. Other tax-hand propodelo to increase access toInourancs to health insurance or contain health care coats hays also beenintroduced. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISNumerous bills have been introduced in the 103rd Congress providing for changesin Federal tax law to promote financial access to insurance coverage and medicalservices or to contain health care costs. Some bills provide for incentive' throughcredits and deductions. Others use tax penalties, such as limits on current-law creditsor deductions, for failure to comply with certain requirements, such as providing healthinsurance benefits in excess of some specified limit. Still others, such as medicalsavings account proposals, allow individuals to set aside pre-tax earnings in specialaccounts to be used to pay for medical expenses. Many of these measures are stand-alone approaches to health care reform; others are part of broader initiatives.President Bush's proposal to expand access to health insurance used refundabletax credits (combined with an expanded deduction for higher income persons) toencourage individuals to purchase insurance. The health care reform plan advanced byPresident Clinton during the 1992 campaign would provide tax credits and deductionsto help offset the cost to small businesses of providing health insurance to theiremployees. So friz, it looks like these measures will be in the plan President Clintonsends to Congress later this year.Two tax-based health care initiatives were incorporated in bills passed by the102nd Congress but vetoed by President Bush. One would have extended the 25%deduction for self-employed businesses. The second would have allcwed withdrawalsfrom individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to pay for qualified nedical expenseswithout incurring a tax penalty. Efforts are likely to made early in the 103rd Congressto restore the 25% deduction for the self-employed. Other tax-based approaches toexpanding coverage and controlling health care costs also will be among those serioust,considered by the 103rd Congress.Current Federal Tax LawsUnder current law, the Fe..ieral Government provides incentives to employers tofurnish health insurance by treating the cost of insurance as a deductible business CRS-1 BEST COPY AVAILABLE '.. 224 1E93002 02-19-93 expense and by excluding employer-provided benefits from taxable employee income.In addition, individuals may deduct medical expenses, including health insurancepremiums, to the extent to which those expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.Low-income families may also receive a tax credit for part of the costs of purchasingcoverage for children.Employer Exclusion. The Internal Revenue Code excludes from taxable incomeof workers all contributions made by employers on their behalf to health and accidentplans.(Employer-provided health insurance would otherwise be treated as analternative to wages and salaries and thus treated as taxable income.) Contributionsare also excluded from the wage base for determining Social Security taxes.Employer Business Expense Deduction and SeltEtup ayed Deduction.Employers may deduct as an ordinary business expense 100% of the contributions madeon behalf of their employees for health benefits. The self-employed whose businessesare not incorporated may deduct as a business expense the full cost of coverage foremployees, but not for themselves and their families. Instead, the self-employed were,until June 30, 1992, provided a separate deduction on their tax returns, limited to 25%of the amounts paid for health insurance for themselves, their spouses, and theirdependents when calculating their adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Thededuction was not allowed if the self-employed person was also eligible to participatein any subsidized health plan of another employer or the employer of his/ber spouse.The amounts deductible did not reduce the income base for computation of the self-employed individual's Social Security tax.The 25% deduction for the self-employed was added to the Code by the Tax ReformAct of 1986 (P.L. 99-614) and was originally scheduled to apply only to tax years endingon or before Dec. 31, 1989. The deduction was repeatedly extended, but was allowedto expire in 1992. As passed by Congress, H.R. 4210, the Tax Fairness and EconomicGrowth Act of 1992, and H.R. 11, the Revenue Act of 1992, would have extended thededuction through June 30, 1993. However, both bills were vetoed.Health Insurance 'Pax Credit. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990(P.L. 101-508) created a small tax credit for low-income persons buying coverage forchildren. This tax credit is a supplement to the earned income tax credit (EITC), a'refundable' credit for families with children whose incomes are below $22,370 in 1992.If the EITC for a family is greater than the family's tax liability, the excess is payableto the family. Those who are eligible may also elect to receive advance payments overthe course of the year, instead of waiting for a refund in the following year. Thesupplemental health insurance credit is available for families eligible for the EITC whobuy coverage that includes qualifying children. The maximum credit ia $451 forfamilies with earned incomes below $11,840 in 1992; the credit is reduced as familiesapproach the $22,370 income limit. Because the credit first became available only in1991, there are not yet any estimates of the number of families taking advantage of it.Medical Expenie Deduction. Individuals who itemize deductions on theirFederal income tax returns have been able to deduct nonreimbursed medical expenses(including insurance premiums) above a specified floor since 1942. From 1954 through1982, the floor for the medical expense deduction was 3% of the taxpayer's adjustedgross income (AGI).A separate floor of 1% of AGI applied to nonreimbursedexpenditures for medicine and drugs. Under the Tex Equity and Fiscal Responsibility CRS-2 111\",225 IB93002 02-19-93 Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248), the overall floor was increased to 5% of AGI, and was appliedto the total of all eligible medical expenses, prescription drugs and insulin. Theseparate floor for medicine and drug expenses wall eliminated. In addition,nonprescription drugs were made inelip;ible for the deduction. Under the Tax ReformAct of 1986 (P.L. 99-514), the floor for the medical expense deduction was increased to7.5% of AGI, beginning in 1987. The deductions can be taken for medical care of thetaxpayer and of the taxpayer's spouse and dependents. Thus, current law permitstaxpayers to deduct the costs of health care that are, in effect, catastrophic as measuredagainst family income.Federal Tax Expenditures. The reductions in Federal revenues retrulting fromfavorable treatment of certain types of private spending are often referred to as 'taxexpenditures; the term reflects an aseumption that the tax provisions achieve indirectlyobjectives that might ale\u00b0 have been achieved through direct expenditure programs.Federal tax expenditures for the medical expense deduction and the exclusion ofemployer-provided benefits from employees' taxable income are projected by the JointCommittee on Taxation to total $49.5 billion in 1993. (This figure excludes lost SocialSecurity payroll taxes, because higher collections now would mean higher benefitpayments later.) The low-income health insurance tax credit will cost $0.7 billion. Theeelf-employed health insurance deduction, if it had been extended at the 25% level,would have coat another $200 million. No estimates are available for the generalemployer bus:nese expense deduction for the costs of employee health benefits. Federalhealth-related deductions and exclusions may also affect the revenues of thcee State andlocal governments that impose an income tax and that follow the Federal system.Tax System Options for Health Care ReformProposals to modify the current tax treatment of health insurance have arisen inthe context of the broader debate over how to provide health coverage to the uninsured(35.4 million in 1991) while controlling the growth in national health spending,projected to reach $808 billion, or 13.6% of gross domestic product, in 1992. Tax systemchanges may serve either of these two broad objective.. On the one hand, enhancementof existing deductions and credits could encourage individuals to purchase coverage oremployers to provide it to their workers. On the other hand, limits on the favorabletax treatment already provided for health coverage could encourage restraint inpersonal health spending. While the two goals appear to be in conflict, many proposalsembody both approathes, using savings from limiting tax benefits for some individual,in order to expand tax benefits for others. Some of these proposals view changes in thetax system as a way of reetructuring incentives for health care consumers andproviders. This approach is a central component of some of the 'ir anaged competition'plans now under discussion. It also underlies the design of plans that would establishMSAs.Measures to Encourage Insurance CoverageNumerous proposals would crer.c new Federal or State tax subsidies, or modifyexisting ones, to help individuals wit the ccet of health insurance (including, in somecases, the employee contribution reci aired in mcet group health plans) or to encourageemployers to provide coverage to their workers. Whether targeted at individuals oremployers, tax incentive proposals rest on the assumption that assistance with the CRS-3 226 1B93002 02-19-93 purchase of private insurance is preferable to direct public provision of health careooverage.Proponents of this view believe that health care reform should build on theexisting system of private coverage. They argue that a competitive private market ismore likely than a bovernment-operated system to promote efficiency and maintainquality. Those favoring public programs point out, however, that private insurance hashigh administrative costs (an average of 16.5% above medical benefits paid in 1990,compared to 2.1% for Medicare and 5.3% for Medicaid). Private insurers have expenses,such as marketing costs, that public programs do not incur, and must also buildreserves and/or produce a profit for stockholders. These costs may be partially offsetif private insurers are better able to control health core utilization or negotiate lowerprices for medical services.The goals met by tax subsidies could also be achieved through direct public grantsto individuals or businesses to assist with the purchase of health coverage. The taxsystem provides a relatively simple way to transfer money to individuale and families.Tax subsidies could be administered uaing existing tax filing and refund procedures;they would not require the creation of new administrative agencies or procedures.However, new procedures would be required if, as in some tax credit proposals,assistance would also be provided on a means-tested basis to low-income persons whodo not currently file tax returns.IndividualsTax incentives for the individual purchue of health insurance could take eitherof two forms: an expanded deduction (which reduces the amount of income subject totax) or a credit (which directly reduces the amount of tax paid).The current medical expense deduction provides assistance only to taxpayers whoitemize deductions on their returns inatead of taking the standard deduction. Exceptfor homeowners, most low-income and some middle-income taxpayers derive no benefitfrom the deduction, because their other potential deductiona are insufficient to raise thetotal to an amount greater than the standard deduction. One proposal would be toallow direct deduction of medical expenses by taxpayers who do not itemize. However,the benefits for lower-income families would still be limited. For those in the lowesttax bracket, the deduction would subsidize no more than 15% of their premium costs,and it would provide no assistance to families whose incomes are so low that they haveno income tax liability.For this reason, most tax incentive bills use a tax credit instead of a tax deduction(exceptions include Ha. 144 and H.R. 403). To ensure that assistance would beavailable to lower-income families, most proposals call for a refundable credit: if theamount of the allowable credit exceeds an individual's tax liability, the difference ispayable to the individual.A refundable tax credit for low-income taxpayers (combined with an expandeddeduction for higher-income persons) was the centerpiece of the health care proposaladvanced by President Bush in February 1992. The President's plan would haveprovided a maximum credit of $1,250 for individuals and $3,750 for families withincomes below the minimum subject to Federal income tax; the maximum credit would k;CRS-4 227 1B93002 0249-93 have declined as family income rose. Families eligible for the maximum credit couldhave received a voucher to purchase coverage over the course of the year, inatead ofwaiting until the end of the year to claim a refund. Each State would have beenrequired to ensure that at least some basic plan would be available within the State ata price no greater than the maximum credit amount The Administration projected thetotal cost of the proposal to the Federal Government at $35 billion in 1997 dollars.Although this component of the President's proposal was never submitted to Congress,HR. 5335 closely resembled the President's plan. Refundable tax credits were includedin a number S. 1936, S. 2347. They are also in H.R. 196 and S. 28, introduced inthe 103rd Congress.Propoeals similar to the Bush Administration plan may well receive furtherconsideration in the 103rd Congress, and the issues raised by the plan remain ofcontinuing interest in considering any tax credit approach toward expanding access tocoverage. The firet issue is that of adequacy: are the credits sufficient to encouragemany individuals to purchase basic coverage? The Administration contended thatmarket reforms and other cost containment proposals included in the plan would reducethe cost of insurance; critics of the plan argued that those assumptions were unrealisticand that larger subsidies were needed. They noted that the credit amounts phaseddown very rapidly with increasing income. It was not certain that low-income familiesreceiving only a partial credit would be able or willing to make the additionalexpenditure needed to buy coverage. These concerns could be addressed by increasingthe amount of the credits, but the coet to the Federal Treasury would also be increased.There is also a question of how much the credit amount should be allowed to grow infuture years. If the credit keepe pace with growth in medical care spending, there maybe no incentive for inirurers or providers to improve efficiency; if the credit falls too farbehind that growth, the value of the benefits it can purchase may decline from year toyear.A second question raised by tax credit plans is that of equity. Because healthinsurance costs vary by geography and by characteristics of the purchaser (such se ageand sex), a fixed national credit amount might not allow all individuals to purchasecomparable coverage. There may also be problems in targeting tax credits to avoidreplacing existing public and private expenditures. Under the Bush Administrationproposal, for example, some employers would have had incentives to reduce theircontributions to premiums for low-income employees, because the employees could usecredit,' to pay more towards their coverage. In addition, many poor individuals eligiblefor the maximum credit might have been shifted from Medicaid (with jointState/Federal funding) to a private plan purchased with the credit (solely Federalfunding).Finally, as was noted above, much of the amount distributed to individuals in theform of a credit would go to cover private ineurers' administrative costs. Forindividually purchased coverage, these costs can be over 40% of benefits (compared toabout ;for the largest employer groups). The cost of a tax credit approach maytherefore depend on whether the proposal include, some method for aggregatingconsumers into larger purchasing groups. CRS-5 228 1B93002 02-19-93 DK ScleraTax credits and deductions could also be used to influence employers' decisionsregarding the purchave of health insurance. Such decisions can also be influencedthrough the use of tax penalties. For example, several 102nd Congress bills would havelevied a sizable penalty on employer plans exceeding a specified basic benefit package(see H.R. 2565 and KR. 5936.)The Self-Employed Tax Deduction. The likelihood of receiving healthinsurance from an employer is highly associated with a firm's size and organizationalstructure. Coverage rates decrease as firm size decreases; coverage is least likely forfirms with fewer than 10 employees where the owner is self-employed. Many believethat health insurance coverage rates are lower for self-employed businesses because theowner of the firm is limited to a 25% personal income tax deduction for the costs ofbuying insurance for himself end his family.While many bills were introduced in the 102nd Congress to extend the 25%deduction and/or increase it to 100%, in the end Congress voted to extend the 25%deduction for another 12 months (July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1993) as part of theconference agreement for the Revenue Act of 1992 (H.R. 11). H.R. 11 bill was vetoedby President Bush for reasons having nothing to do with this provision. PresidentClinton indicated support for full deductibility during the 1992 campaign.Early in the 103rd Congress, efforts are being renewed to restore the 25%deduction and/or to increase the deduction to 100%. Some bills phase in an increasein the deduction over several years; others provide for immediate full deductibility.Many proposals to increate the restore or increase the tax deduction are freestandingthey are solely intended to treat the deductibility of health care costs for self-employedbusinesses. Some are included in broader reform proposals. (See \"Legislation below.)Proponents of full deductibility for self-employed firms argue that it wouldequalize the treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance. They say it is unfairthat a self-employed person whose gross income includes most of the value of employer-paid health Insurance has less after tax income than an employee with the same wages,other fringe benefits and expenaes, but whose income does not include the value of anyemployer-paid health insurance. Opponents might respond that in the case of the self-employed, the employee is also an owner, and can therefore decide on how they will becompensated. Giving the self-employed a larger deduction for health benefits mightencourage such owners to subetitute tax-free health insurance for taxable wages. Also,providing the 100% deduction could encourage the purchase of richer Madillaclinsurance plans, thus driving up utilization of medical services and fueling inflation ofhealth care costa. While this problem could be eased by limiting full deductibility tothose plans that include but do not exceed some specified set of benefit!, enforcing suchlimits could be problematic.Proponents of full deductibility also argue that the 100% deduction v.ould increasethe incentive for self-employed businesses to buy insurance for their workers. TheNational Federation of Independent Businesees estimates, for example, that uninsuredworkers would decline by 25 to 50% as a result of increasing the deduction to 100%.Others are skeptical that this tax change would produce such a significant reductionin uninsured workers and their dependents. While over 20% of uninsured workers andtheir families are linked to self-employed firms, full deductibility might not induce large .1IC; ;,.;CRS-6 229 IB93J02 02-19-93 numbers of self-employed businesses to buy imeurance for their employees. Many self-employed firms are unprofitsble and have no tax liability to offeet by a eduction thatis not refundable. Alao, changing the self-employed deduction only affects the taxableamount of income of the self-employed proprietor; it does not alter the tax treatmentof premiums peid for employees' coverage. Because the after-tax costs for healthinsurance decline as the number of employees rise, full deductibility would most heavilybenefit those firms where the proprietor ie the only employee, and least benefit thosewith more than a few employees. Raising the deduction to 100% also raises budgetissues. In March 1992, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation eetimated thatthe coet of extending the deduction at its current level of 26% for on* year is about$200 million; the cost of increasing the deduction to 100% is $1.7 billion for FY1994and $1.2 billion for FY1995.Tax Credits for Small Businesses. Some proposals would provide tax creditsto employers to offset some of the coat of providing health insurance to their employeesand their employee's families. (See 102nd 1936and S. 2114. The Clinton-Gore campaign proposal also included tax credits for smallbusinesses.)Credits can be more effective than deductions in changing behaviorbecause the amount of the credit does not necessarily depend on a firm having a taxliability. Eligible firmseven thoee with no profits on which to pay taxes could stillreceive a credit to offset some portion of their employee health benefit wets. Taxcredits can stand alone or be used in conjunction with other approaches to expandingcoverage, such as pay-or-play proposals, private insurance market reform, orcombination of tax credits and deductions for individuals and businesses.Different tax credit designs are possible, depending on the objective. Mott areintended to ease the burden of providing health benefits on smaller employers, oftendefined as firms with 100 or fewer employee.. Some bills draw the line at 50 employees,some at 25. The credit can be made available to all such small employers, only thosenewly providing health insurance, or thaw meeting specific requirements, euch as thoseparticipating in a small employer purchasing group. If the credit were available to allsmall employers, private dollars now spent for coverage would be replaced by publicdollars.If the credit were limited to currently uninsured firms, the public subsidyresulting from the tax credit would be more directly targeted on reducing the numberof uninsured workers and theii families. However, firms not receiving the creditsbecauee they already provided coverage could argue that they would be treated unfairlyand could be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Some bills, such as S. 1227 in the102nd Congress, further limit the availability of the tax credit to only those small firmsfor whom the cost of providing health insurance represents significant financialobligation, measured either aa a specified percentage of payroll or profits or somecombination of both.The design of the tax credit may also reflect other objectives such as encouragingthe purchase of various types of insurance benefits and/or encouraging the containmentof health care costs. Some proposals limit the tax credit for the purchaee of qualifiedplane, meaning a specified benefit package, specified cost-sharing in the form ofdeductibles and coinsurance, a package that includes managed care elements, and/orsome other feature that may be desired because of its effects on the cost or quality ofcare. Some proposals make the credit available on an ongoing basis. Others phase itout as other elements of the proposal take effect. CRS-7 ri 230 IB93002 02-19-93 The effects of tax credits on coverage rates are unclear. Under voluntaryprogram in which the credits are used as an incentive for employers to buy coverage,much depends on the size of the subsidy provided through the tax credit, the cost ofinsurance, awareness of the credit, and other factors such as whether changes are madeto the private insurance market to make insurance more available. State and localexperiments using direct small employer subsidies such as tax credits to encourage thepurchase of health insurance have produced only modest increases in coverage. Undera compulaory program, such as an employer mandate or play-or-pay requirement, thetax credits could offset some of the cost of providing coverage, thereby reducing adverseeffects of the mandate on eligible employers and their employees.Options to Contain Costs and/or Finanoe Expanded CoverageTaxing Employer.Paid Health Insurance. As noted above, when an employerpays part or all of the health insurance benefits or premium for an employee, theemployee is not taxed on the employer's contribution. Instead, the contribution iswholly excluded from the employee's statement of wai5:4 and salary. The tax-freestatus of employer-paid health benefits has been credited with encouraging the growthof health plans offered through the work place, so that today, about 65% of thenonaged population is covered by employer-sponsored health insurance.Some lawmakers and health policy experts have proposed the elimination of theexclusion (see S. 3348 from the 102nd Congress and 'Heritage Foundation' below).Another possibility is to place a limit on the amount of contributions that can beexcluded from an employee's taxable income (see, for example, H.R. 834 and S. 325 fromthe 103rd Congress). The limit I. often referred to as eta: cap.\"Some advocates of eliminating or limiting the exclusion focus on the potentialrevenue gains, while others focus on the implications for health policy, contending thatthe current exclusion stimulates medical care inflation by encouraeng excels insurancecoverage. Opponents of changing the treatment of employer contributions argue thatthe loss in foregone revenues to the Federal Treasury ($46.4 billion in 1993) is faroutweighed by the value of the benefits to employees.There are at least two ways of limiting the tax exclusion for health benefits. Oneis to set a fixed dollar limit on employer contributione and tax any contribution inexcess of that limit. Another option is to define a minimum standard benefit packageand tax contributions to a plan whose benefits exceeded that standard. Either optioncould be applied to all taxpayers or limited to higher-income taxpayers. Howeverimplemented, a tax cap would theoretically change the way employees assessed thevalue of insurance coverage. The current exclusion has meant that each additionaldollar of health benefits is worth more than a dollar of wages. As a result, workersnegotiating a total compensation package may opt for more insurance than they wouldpurchase if they had to use after-tax dollars. A tax cap might shift the balance backtowards wages.From a revenue standpoint, it would make no difference whether employees choseto continue receiving health benefits in excess of the tax cap or chose to convert theexcess into wages. The Treasury would gain either way (but would not gain if workersshifted their health insurance dollars to some other form of tax-free compensation).From a health policy standpoint, however, the choice between wages and benefits is an f* ;211*sJCRS-8 231 1393002 0249-93 important one. Would employees reduce their insurance coverage in respome to a taxcap, and would any such reductions change the way they used medical urvices?Precisely because the curren: system has been in place for so long, there is littleempirical evidence about how much coverage people would buy in the absence of a taxsubeidy, or how they might ehange their coverage if pressured to reduce it The effectsof a tax cap on the medical care syetem are, then, less predictable than the effects onrevenues.Limiting Employers' Deductions for Medical Insuranoe. Another optionwould be to eliminate or cap the amount an employer is allowed to deduct u &businessexpense for providing employee health benefits. For example, in the 102nd Congress,11.E. 3892 would have denied the deduction to an employer's group health plan thatdiscriminates against adopted children. H.R. 2264 would have denied the deduction forself-insured health plane that discriminate against services performed by chiropractors.S. 2346 and HR. 5174 would have denied the deduction in the case of employer planethat do not meet specific benefit qualifications. S. 9348 would have limited thededuction to an overall per employee dollar amount. H.R. 191 in the 103rd Congresswould deny the deduction for providing coverage in excess of a defined minimum benefitpackage. The effectiveness of reducing or eliminating the deductibility of premiumcontributions in influencing employers' decisions regarding health benefits would varywith the value of the deduction as well as other factors, euch iur the employer's need toprovide comprehensive benefits to attract and retain employees.Medical Savings Accounts (MBAs). A different cost containment approach iscaptured in bills providing for medical spending accounts (MSAs). (See, for example,103rd Congress bills: H.R. 101, H.R. 150, and H.R. 192.) The MSA approach is basedon the assumption that spending on health care is out of control because consumers areshielded from the coats of care by their health inaurance plans, the direct costs of whichare fully or partially paid by employers. (Indirectly, employees may be paying throu&foregone wage incresses.) To sensitize consumers to the costs of care, they must beplaced in the position of paying directly for that care.Under most MSA proposals, employers would be allowed to pay the amounts theycurrently spend on employee health benefits directly to their employees. This amountwould not be included as taxable wages to the employee, and would be deductible by theemployer as a normal business expense. Employees would then set up their own MSMand buy their own insurance policies. Workers and their families could use their MSAsto pay for all routine medical services; any unused funds could remain in the account,collecting interest (usually tax-free), and withdrawn later to pay for medical expenses.Funds withdrawn for other purpoees would be treated as taxable income (much likeearly withdrawals for individual retirement accounts). Insurance policies would onlycover catastrophic medical expenses, defined as expenses in excess of a specifiedthreshold. Some MSA proposals would also provide federal subsidies to thou in needto assist them in buying the catastrophic insurance.In addition to containing costa, proponents of the MSA approach say that it wouldmake insurance more portable than today's employer-sponsored health plans, becauseemployees could, in effect, take their accounts with them. Moreover, employers wouldno longer have to bear the administrative burdens of setting up health plansnegotiating with insurers, and/or paying claims. Their principal role would be afinancial one: to make contributions to employees' MSM. Also, MSAs could provide CRS-9 23 r 232 IB93002 02-19-93 greater benefit flexibility than typical employer-sponsored health plans. Employee.would not be limited to one or a few insurance plans offered by an employer. They would instead have the entire market of insurers and their catastrophic plans fromwhich to chaos*.Opponents of MSAs say that their cost containment potential is greatly overstated.They argue that the consumer has relatively little influence over the intensity andvolume of medical services. It is, instead, the physician who makes the most criticalbuying decisions. Also, they say, it is not clear whether many consumers are willing to buy the economy model of medical care. They might prefer the more expensive physician or hospital, making an assumption that cost and quality are linked. Anotherproblem is that under the MSA approach, individuals do not have the bargaining power to obtain the kinds of discounted rates that are negotiated by large employers andinsurers with providers. Some critics also argue that MSAs are incompatible withmanaged care arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (11M0s), andthus go against effective cost containment. HMOs, for example, tly to control costs by managing care from the time the patient enters the health care system. By the timecatastrophic coverage is needed the point at which insurance is triggered under the MSA approach -- it is too late in the episode of care to manage.Opponents also question other claims made by MSA advocates. They say that while the MSA itself might be portable, the source of financing would still be employer-dependent, and thus unpredictable. Some employers might not contribute; others mightmake inadequate contributions. Another concern is that the MSA approach moves people out of group insurance into the more expensive and less reliable individualinsurance market to buy catastrophic policies. This could cause significant disruptionsin coverage.Finally, opponents argue that because the MSA approach only shiftscurrent employer dollars from one system to another, it appears to do nothing toexpand access to coverage for America's 35 million uninsured, and could lead to increased numbers of uninsured if the solvency of MSA accounts were dependent upon the continuity of employer contributions.Tax Incentives and Competitive Approaches to Universal CoverageNumerous proposals have been advanced that combine limits on the favorable taxtreatment of employer-provided coverage with subsidies (whether or not tax-based) forthe purchase of individual coverage. Several bills in the 102nd Congress adopted this approach, including H.R. 6936 (Representative Cooper, Conservative DemocraticForum (Representative McEwen), and S. 3348 (SenatorHatch). It is also incorporated in S. 223 (Senator Cohen), introduced in the 103rdCongress. Similar proposals have been developed by trade aseociations, academics, andothers. Among the more widely discussed are the Jackson Hole plan (by AlainEnthoven, Paul Ellwood, and Lynn Etheredge), a plan by Mark Pauly and hiscolleagues (sometimes referred to as the American Enterprise Institute or AE) proposal), and the Heritage Foundation plan.All these proposals assume that the existing tax treatment of employer-providedhealth insurance creates inequity in the government subsidization of health care mete (because the tax benefits increaee with income) and fuels health care inflation by shielding individuals from the costs of their medical care purchasing decisions. Byshifting some or all Federal Resistance (whether tax or non-tax) away from employer- 23fiCRS-10 233 IB93062 02-19-93 based plans and towards individuals, they seek to ensure that every American has basichealth coverage, reprdlees of employment status. (They may also addrees 'job lock,'workers' reluctance to change jobs because of a fear of losing health benefits.)However, the major focus of the competition propcsals is on cost containment: theyseek to encourage individuals to be cort-conscious in their choice of health insuranceand/or in their use of medical services by giving them a more direct financial stake inthose decisions. All the plans assume that, if consumers are given financial stake intheir health care purchasing decisions, the market will respond: health care providersand/or insurers will compete on the basis of price and quality.Proposals to restructure financial incentives and promote competition have beendebated for many years. For example, Ellwood and Enthoven each advanced earlyverrions of their current proposal in the 1970s. Several basic concerns have been raisedabout the competitive approach in the put. First, individual consumers may not havesufficient information or sophistication to compare the relative quality of differenthealth plans; even price comparisons may be complicated if different insurers offerdifferent benefit packages. Second, insurers may be able to compete, not on the basisof quality or efficiency, but on the basis of their ability to attract low-cost enrollees andscreen out those presenting higher risks (by rejecting some individuals, imposingwaiting periods for coverage of preexisting conditions, or charging high-risk enrolleesprohibitive premiums). Third, as was noted earlier, administrative carts for individualcoverage are much higher than for group coverage, and may offset any expected savingsfrom competition.Each of the proposals attempts to address some or all of these concerns. All theplans call for a uniform minimum benefit package, to facilitate comparison amongcompeting insurers.All except the Heritage and Pauly proposals would regulateinsurance underwriting practices, to limit the ability of insurers to screen out high-riskapplicants. (Pauly suggeets, in lieu of regulation, that higher-risk individuals might begiven more tax assistance to meet the higher premiums they would have to pay.) TheJackson Hole and CDF plans go further, proposing the development of structuredsystems for what they term 'managed competition. (See CRS Issue Brief 93008, HealthCare Reform: Managed Competition, by Mark Merlis.)Under managed competition, employers or other purchasers of health insurancewould be grouped together in cooperative buying arrangements known as healthinsurance purchasing corporations or cooperativee (HIPCs). Individuale participatingin the arrangement would have a choice among different health care plans and wouldbe even a financial incentive to select the least costly plan. Plana would have uniformbenefits, so that in theory any price differences would reflect relative efficiency.Proponents of this Epproach assume that the less costly plans would resemble healthmaintenance organizations (HMOs), which provide care through a restricted networkof affiliated providers. Consumers wishing to select a less restrictive and more costlyplan would have to pay the added costs from their own funds, without tax assistance.(It should be noted that not all managed competition plans involve tax system changes.Senator Bingainan's propoeal (S. 3300 in the 102nd Congress) and draft President-electClinton's campaign proposal used other means to encourage the choice of efficientplans.)Critics of this approach argue that the widence of saving. from managed care ielimited and that systems offering multiple cl.. zu of plans may be subject to 'biased CRS-11 2 3, 234 1893002 02-19-93 selection. All the young and healthy people may wind up in HMOs or other restrictiveplans, while the older and sicker enrollees stay with the conventional plan and continueto incur high coats. Proponents of managed competition suggest adjusting premiumrates to correct for this problem; however, it is not yet certain that adequate methodsare available. (Forfull discussion of the cost-saving potential of managed care, IletCRS Report 90-64, Controlling Health Care Costs.)The following is a brief summary of the major tax-based plans advanced to date.Heritage Foundation plan. Under the Heritage plan, the existing tax exclusionfor employer contributions for health insurance would be phased out and replaced withrefundable tax credits, the amount of which would be tied to a family's income,insurance premiums, and other health care expenses. Credits could be used both forinsurance premiums and for payment of out-of-pocket expenses. Lower-income familieswith high medical expense* would be moet favored by the credits; high-income familieswith low medical expenses would be least favored. All Americans would be required toenroll in a health insurance plan containing Federally prescribed benefits, includingcoverage for catastrophic expenses, hospital and physician services, and routinepreventive care. Plan deductibles and coinsurance could not exceed 10% of a family'sincome and would be offset by the tax credits. Medicare would be continued for theelderly and disabled, Medicaid for eligible low-income persons.Pauly plan. The Pauly (or AEI) plan also repeals the tax exclusion of employer-provided health benefits and provides income-based tax credits to assist individuals inpurchasing plans providing minimum federally specified benefits. There are at leastfour major differences between this and the Heritage plan. First, employers would berequired to perform some administrative functions to facilitate employees' purchase ofcoverage. Second, tax credits could be used only to subsidize premiums and not to payfor medical services.Third, cost-sharing requirements under the minimum benefitpackage would be inversely related to enrollees' income. Finally, the amount of taxcredits might be adjusted to reflect the level of health risk presented by each individual,in order to reduce the incentives for insurers to exclude potentially costly applicants.H.1L 5989/S. 3348 (102nd Congress). The McEwen-Hatch proposal resemblesthe Heritage plan: it phases out the employer exclusion and provides a tax credit thatcan be used both for purchase of a basic health plan and for direct payment of medicalexpenses. However, the size of the credit is not related to income, and the maximumamount is limited to 80% of the first $276 in premiums per person, 18% of remainingpremiums, and 18% of health care costs not covered by health insurance. Tbe billincludes stronger measures than the Heritage and Pauly proposals to ensure thatcoverage will be available to individuals receiving the credit. States would be requiredto establish programs to provide coverage (with income-related premiums) for theuninsured; the bill also includes regulation of underwriting and rating practices of smallgroup insurers.Jackson Hole plan.The Jackson Hole proposal would limit the employerexclusion to the cost of the lowest-priced plan available through the HIPC in the area(whether or not the employer's plan was actually purchased through the cooperative).Employers would be required to contribute towards coverage of their full-time workersand dependents; any difference between the employer's contribution and the totalpremium for the lowest-priced plan would be deductible for the individual. Non-tax CRS-12 238 235 IB93002 02-19-93system govermnent subsidies would be available to help persons without employer coverage purchase a IEIPC plan.H.B. 5938 (102nd Congress). The COP proposal is baeed on the Jackson Hole plan, but differs from it in at least two key features. First, employers would not be required to contribute towards employee coverage. Second, instead of limiting the exclusion of employer contributions from employees' taxable income, the plan imposes a tax penalty on an employer whose contributions exceed the coat of the loweat-price 111PC plan.LEGISLATIONPlease note that many of these bills include more than tax system changes.H.R. 30 (Grandy)Universal Health Benefits Empowerment and Partnership Act of 1993.

Provincial and territorial authorities design their own programs according to Federal standards. Each program must ensure that: individuals have access to needed medical services without regard to cost; benefit packages include allmedically necessary hospital and physician services; all residents of a province are covered; insurance coverage is continued when Canadians travel from oneprovince to another; and insurance plans are administered on a non-profit basis by a public authority.While administration of the health insurance program is primarily a provincial responsibility, the Federal Government provides block grants to the provinces to help defray the cost. Without regard to individual provincial health expenditures, provinces and territories receive an equal per capita contribution from the Federal Government, adjusted annually to take intoaccount increases in Gross National Product.In general, health services are provided through the private sector.However, provinces have the authority to determine the method and rate of limbursement for health care providers. Most Canadian hospitals receivefu i. ds under global budgets. With the exception of hoepital-based physicianswho are salaried employees of the hospitals, most physicians are paid on a fee- for-service basis. The fee schedule is determined on the provincial level bynegotiationsbetween publicauthorities andprofessionalassociations representing the health care practitioners.The provincial health systems do not limit care for life-threateningconditions. However, restraints placed on hospitals budgets and limits on the number of specialty physicians have produced waiting lists for some elective services.Systematic data on waiting times are not available but anecdotalreports indicate that waiting lists exist for some procedures in each provincebut that the times and procedures vary by province.Analysts have pointed to both advantages and disadvantages of theCanadian system when compared to the U.S. health care system. Canada hasachieved universal coverage of its population while spending about 38 percentless per capita on health than the United States. On the other hand, someforms of medical technology are less available in Canada, there is lessinnovation in the delivery and financing of health care, and the lack of cost-sharing requirements appears to encourage excess utilization. Both countriesface difficult financing and service delivery problems as aging populations,technology changes and i..!creases in the volume and intensity of servicescontinue to fuel costs. 243 240 THE CANADIAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEMINI'RODUCTIONSince 1972, Canada has provided universal health insurance coverage toits legal residents through health insurance programs jointly financed by theFederal Government and provincial and territorial authorities.' The healthinsurance program evolved in a series of steps, beginning with the initiationof universal hospital insurance by the western province of Saskatchewan in1946. In 1957, the Federal Goverinnent encouraged the expansion of hospitalinsurance programs in all the provinces and territories by providing cashsubsidies to jurisdictions that instituted qualified plans. In 1962, a similarprogram was instituted to cover physician care and other medical services. Allof the provinces and territories had adopted qualified plans by 1972.In 1987, Canadian health care expenditures accounted for 8.6 percent ofgross national product (GNP). This represented expenditures of approximately$1,483 per capita, making Canada second only to the United States in thiscategory. The public sector in Canada accounted for approximately 75 percentof these payments compared to 41 percent in the US.CoverageCurrently, all legal residents of Canada are covered by one of the nation's10 provincial or 2 territorial health insurance plans. Local authorities designtheir own health inturance programs following Federal standards, codified inthe Canada Health Act or 1984. . According to theft guidelines, provincial .plans must meet the following criteria in order to qualify for full Federal cashcontributions to their programa: 'Unless otherwise noted, general information on the Canadian health caresystem is derived primarily from: Canada.

To ensure that patients are not forced toforego care because of out-of-pocket medical expenses, umer chargesand extra-billing' may not be imposed.'Benefits offered by insurance plans must be comprehensive, includingmedically necessary services provided by hospitals and physicians.All residents of a province must be entitled to insured healthservices. A waiting period prior to entitlement by residents may notexceed 3 months.Canadians moving from one province to another must continue to becovered for insured health services by their home province duringany waiting period imposed by their new province of residence.Medical care for residents of one province who are temporarilyvisiting another province is reimbursed under the insurance plan ofthe patient's home province.Provincial health insurance plans must be administered and operatedon a non-profit basis by a public authority.BenefitsAll of the provincial and territorial health insurance plans must covermedically necesaary hospital services, physician services and certain surgicaldental procedures. There are no dollar limits to the amount of necessarymedical care that individuals may receive. All plans include the following benefits:In-patient hospital care including accommodations and meals at thestandard ward level, nursing services, necessary drugs, medical andsurgical supplies and diagnostic tests.Out-patient hospital services including emergency visits, laboratory,radiological and other diagnostic procedures.Physicianservicesincludingallmedicallynecessaryservicesperformed by medical practitioners in hospitals, clinics or physicians'offices. 'Extra-billing occurs when physicians charge patients an additionalamount above the fee negotiated by the province with physicians collectively.'Provinces are not forbidden by law to impose user fees or extra-billingbut are subject to dollar-for-dollar deductions from Federal contributions totheir health insurance programs if they permit these practices. 245 242 CRS-3 Provinces are not required to insure residents for the costs of eyeglasses,outpatient prescription drugs, general dental care and semiprivate or privatehospital accommodations.However most provinces include an outpatientprescription drug benefit for the elderly and individuals who qualify for publicassistance.The Canada Health Act does not speci what benefits are required in acomprehensive program. Additionally, all provinces and territories may includeadditional benefits that are not required under the national guidelines. Forexample, Ontario, the largest province, includes mental health services,ambulance services, the services of chiropractors, osteopaths, chiropodists andapproved physiotherapy clinics within its benefit structure. It also providesa drug benefit program for the elderly and individuals receiving publicassistance.Coverage of long-terrn care is not required under the Canada Health Act.However the Federal Government does make an equal per capita contributionto the provinces and territories in support of nursing home care, home careand ambulatory health care. These payments are not contingent onconformity to the standards required in the general health insurance programand provinces are free to structure their long-term care program as they seefit. As a result, there is significant variation in the type and amount of long-term care provided under provincial plans.FinancingThe health insurance system is financed jointly by the Federal andprovincial and territorial governments. When the national health insuranceprogram was first instituted, the Federal Government reimbursed localauthorities for 50 percent of the incurred cost. of health care services.However after passage of the Federal-Proubwial Fiscal Arrangements andEstablished Program Financing Act in 1977, Federal fiscal contributions to thehealth insurance program were restructured into a block grant approach.Without regard to individual provincial health expenditures, provinces andterritories receive an equal per capita contribution from the FederalGovernment, adjusted annually to take into account increases in nominalGNP. The Federal share takes the form of tax transfers to the provinces andcash subsidies derived from general revenues. Provinces may use the Federalmonies within their health insurance programs as they see fit as long as theFederal criteria are met.While they cannot impose user fees or extra-billing without losing Federalfinancial support, provinces have considerable latitude in determining howtheir share of health care costs are financed. They may institute insurancepremiums, sales taxes, use general rovenues or utilize combination ofapproaches. All provinces and territones use general tax revenues to supportmost of the costs of their insurance programs. In addition, Ontario, BritishColumbia and Alberta impose a small payroll tax premium to raise a portion 246I. 243 CRS-4 of the required sums.Premiums reflect family size but not risk status.However, the elderly and all those who qualify for public assistance areexempt from the premium. Additionally, failure to pay the required premiumdoes not result in loss of access to needed medical services.Health insurance is the single largest program funded by the provincialgovernments, but there is considerable variation in the amount of resourcesthat each jurisdiction devotes to health care and the rate by which health carecosts are increasing. Health care expenditures ranged from approximately 30percent of gross provincial expenditures in Ontario in 1985 to 20 percent ofgross provincial expenditures in Newfoundland in the same year. In theperiod from 1983 to 1987; per capita spending on health care increased by 41percent in Ontario, and 33 percent in Nova Scotia compared to 13 percent inAlberta and 18 percent in British Columbia.Since the inception of the block grant formula, Federal contributions asa percentage of the total cost of the Canadian health care system havegradually decreased.In 1988, the last year for which figures are available,30.4 percent of health care expenditures were financed by the FederalGovernment, compared to 42.2 percent of the costs borne by the provincialgovernments. Private sources were responsible for 25.4 percent of all healthcare expenditures (see figure 1).'AdministrationThe responsibility for administration of the Canadian health care systemlies with the provincial and territorial governments. Federal standards requirethat the health insurance program be administered by a public non-profitauthority. Although private insurance companies exist, they are not permittedto cover services provided under the provincial plan. Thus for all coveredbenefits, the government is the sole payer. When services are provided on afee-for-service basis, bills are sent directly to the provincial authority.The cost of administration has been kept low. It is estimated thatadministrative costs account for approximately 1.5 to 2.5 percent of Canadianhealth expenditures, compared to 6 to 8 percent of U.S. health expenditures.

A distinction is made betweenremuneration for hospitals and physicians.Hospitals accounted for 39.3 percent of total Canadian health care expenditures in 1988. (See figure 2 for the composition of Canadian healthcare expenditures).Most Canadian hospitals receive funds under a globalbudgeting system. Annually, hospital administrators negotiate an operatingbudget with the provincial authorities. Budgets are meant to take into account bed to population and.staff to patient ratios, as well as changes in themix and volume of services provided. Allocation of resources is then the responsibility of the individual hospital administrators.Capital budgets are determined separately. New facilities, equipment,major hospital renovations and other capital expenditures have to be approvedby the Ministry of Health in each province. Provinces vary in the extent towhich they fund capital improvements. However all hospitals are required tofund some of these costs themselves. Methods range from community-widefund raising drives to the issuance of municipal bonds.Most physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis. Fee schedules are determined on the provincial and territorial level by negotiations betweenpublic authorities and professional associations representing the health carepractitioners.These professional associations are also responsible forallocating funds between specialty groupa. Alternately, most haspital-basedphysicians are salaried employees of the hospital:. Payment for physician services accounted for 16.1 percent of total health expenditures in 1988.The provinces have instituted various methods in an attempt to controlthe level of expenditures for physician services. Since the inception of national health insurance in Canada, health care utilization has increased atan annual rate of almost 4 percent. Five provincesOntario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebechave incorporated measuresaimed at controlling the volume of physician services into their fee schedules.Most of these provinces utilize some form of expenditure target by whichexcessive increases in the volume of services provided patients result in areduction in payments in the next negotiated fee schedule. In contrast, Quebec applies a quarterly cap to individual physician incomes. When thefixed ceiling has been reached, further payments are reimbursed at asignificantly lower level during the rettikinder of the quarter. 2 5 i) Figure 2. Composition ofCanadian Health Expenditures1988 Physicians16.1% Drugs116%Capital4.5%Canadian Government: CareIn general, health care services are provided through the private sector.The majority of Canada's hospitals are owned and operated by non-profitentities including municipalities, voluntary agencies and religious groups.While these institutions employ some physicians, the majority of the medicalstaff is composed of private physicians granted admittance privileges by thefacilities.In 1988, there were 4.36 short-term hospital beds per 1,000 persons withan average occupancy rate of 85.5 percent. Average length of stay was 14.14days.While about 25-30 percent of physicians are salaried employees ofhospitals orclinics,the majority of practicing physicians are privatepractitioners reimbursed according to a provincial-wide negotiated fee schedule.6Patients are free to choose their physicians and physicians havethe option of accepting or refusing any patient.As of 1988, there were 57,405 active physicians in Canada, a ratio of onephysician per 451 persons.Of these, 26,079 or 45 percent were generalpractitioners or family physicians, and 23,627 or 41 percent were specialists.The remainder were interns and residents.RationingThe provincial health systems do not limit care for life-threateningconditions. However, restraints placed on hospital budgets and limits on thenumber of specialty physicians have produced rationing the queuewaiting on linefor some elective services. In addition, specific high-technology equipment such as magnetic resonance imagers (MRD and lithotripters areexplicitly controlled by the provincial governments, and are generally restrictedto hospitals.'

Systematic data onwaiting times are not available but anecdotal reports indicate that waitinglists exist for some procedures in each province but that the times andprocedures vary by province.

Physicians are free to makeindividual medical decisions for their patients without direct interference.They are also largely unencumbered by the types of constraints on practicefaced by their U.S. colleagues, such as utilization review, second opinions, andmanaged care. However, because of the increasing volume of services providedby physicians (partly in response to the limits on fees), the provincialgovernments are expected to try to impose limits on the number of servicesfor which they will pay.In addition, some provinces are beginning toexperiment with capitated delivery systems\" They also are looking to theUnited States for methods of encouraging more appropriate and effectivemedical care.Canadian physicians enjoy relatively high incomes. In Ontario, the 1984income of physicians was about five times that of the average industrialworker. For the same period, U.S. physicians' incomes was about 6.5 timesthe average industrial wage. Canadian physicians maintain larger average netincomes (after professional expenses but before taxes) than those of dentists,lawyers, accountants, engineers and architects.\"Canada-United States ComparisonsThe health care syetems of Canada and the United States have much incommon: Providers of care, including _physicians and hogpitals, are largelyprivate.

Similarly, bothsystems have problems with an undersupply of physicians in remote areasbut an oversupply of certain specialists. In addition, health care costs inCanada and the United States are climbing at about the same rate, and bothcountries face difficult financing and service delivery problems as agingpopulations, technology changes, and increasta in the volume and intensity ofservices continue to fuel those costs.There are also a number of ways in which the Canadian and US. systemsare different. Compared to the system in the US., the Canadian system hassome drawbacks: some forms of medical technology are less available, thereis less innovation in the delivery and financing of health care, and the lackof cost-sharing requirements appears to encourage excess utilization. Someanalysts also point to Canada's longer average hospital stays and heavierreliance on institutionalization to care for the elderly as indicators of greaterinefficiency.There are, however, some features of the Canadian system which havebeen admired by US. observers. Although problems exist in obtaining accessto some services, Canada has achieved universal coverage of its population.In contrast, the United States has an estimated 35.6 million people who aretotally uninsured (the estimate is for 1987). Canada's health system also hasbroad public support, whereas recent public opinion surveys in the UnitedStates show substantial dissatisfaction with the American system of healthcare.2'Some analysts have also concluded that Canada gets greater value for itshealth care investment than does the U.S. In 1987, Canada spent about 8.6percent of its GNP on health; the US. spent 11.2 percent. On a per capitabasis, Canada spent $1,483, about 38 percent less than the U.S. total of$2,051. On almost all measures of medical care outcomes, however, such asinfant death rates, life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 40, and agestandardized death rates, Canada does better than the United States. Forexample, for the mid-1980s, Canada's infant mortality rate was about 25percent lower than the US. rate and the average life expectancy at birth inCanada was about 72.9 years for men and 79.8 years for women comparedwith 71.0 and 78.3 years respectively for men and women in the US.A problem in concluding that Canada is getting befter value for its moneyis that some of the differences in medical care outcomes may not beattributable to investment in the health care system. They may have moreto do with differences in rates of poverty, the demographic composition of the \"Blendon, Robert J.Three Systems: A Comparative Survey.

WAS MING TC N February 17, 1993Februaty 17, 1993TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:'lb accompany my address to the Joint Session of the Congress, I am subraitting thisreport, entitled A VisionofChange for America. This report describes the comprehensiveeconomic plan I am proposing for the nation.I am asking you to join vAth the American people in their call for change. My vinion isone of fundamental changeto invest in people, to reward hard work and reotorefairness, and to recognize our families and communities as the corneretonea of Amer:oakstrength.For more than a decade, our government has been caught in the grip of the failed policyof trickle-clown economics. While the rich get richer, middleelass Americans pay moretaxes to their government and get lees in return. My plan will put an end to governmentthat benefita the privileged few and mark the beginning of an economic strategy thatputs people firstMy plan ban three key elementa: economic stimulus to create joba now while laying thefoundation for longterm economic growth; long-term public investments to increase theproductivity of our people and businesses; and serious, fair, and balanoed deficit-reduc-tion plan to stop the government from draining the private investments that generatejobs and increase incomes.The change will not be easy, but the cost of not changing is far greater. We must ensurethat our children's generation is not the rust to do worse than their parents. We mustrestore the American dream.We have already heard the clamor of the powerful special interests who oppose changebecause they profit from the status quo. But the American people have demanded change,and it is our reeponsibility to answer their call. With that in mind. I ask for your helpand support to macre our economy and give our people hope.

Atthis rate health spending will reach an astonishing 18 percent of GDP by theyear 2000: Americans will be devoting almost one dollar of every five they earnto health care, and the average family's health costs will rise to almost $10,000a year.Rising health care costs are straining the budgets of families, businesses, andgovernment. They are eating up incomes and squeezing out other spending.Individuals are facing soaring insurance premiums and rising out-of-pocket bills.Skyrocketing premiums have forced many businesses to drop or curtail healthcoverage for their workers, swelling the ranks of the uninsured. Mort than 37million people do not now have insurance coverage. Many are dependent onhospital emergency units for care.Inflation in health care costs is also robbing government budgets of scarceresources needed for critical investment in our futureeducation, job training,infrastructure, and technology development. If current trends continue, by 1998the Federal Government will spend one in every four dollars on health care(Chart 2-14). State and local spending for health will rise over the same periodfrom 14 to 18 percent of total outlays. Exploding health costs threaten fundingfor other public priorities.Thc rise in health care costs now projected will consume between 25 and 35percent of total projected GDP growth for the rest of the decade and willaccount for over 40 percent of the total increase in Federal spending. In short.containing health care costs has become an economic imperative. Indeed, thepotential \"health dividend\" is far larger than the peace dividend promised by theend of the Cold War. If America spent the same share of GDP on health as ourmain international competitors do, last year alone we would have had $230billion more to invest in our people. Similarly, if spending by employers onhealth insurance had remained at the 1980 percentage of total compensation,cash wagcs for the average workcr could have been $670 a year higher in 1991without affecting corporatc profits.Despite these bleak statistics, widespread evidence suggests that we can controlhealth care costs and maintain quality. Other advanced industrial nations havelevels of health spending substantially below ours and have controlled costgrowth more successfullyeven while providing care that matches and oftenexceeds our own. Their success offers a strong basis for hope as we step up tothe challenge of fundamental change. 26211 259 Controlling Health Care CostsSystemwide health care reform is a top Administration priority, but someadditional short-term savings proposals, focusing on providers rather thanbeneficiaries, make immediale sense.Medicare:HHS/I0 percent capital reductioa, lapatkat.

Under this proposal, beginning in Januaty,1996, the monthly Part 13 premium would be set to maintain the percentage ofprogram costs covered by premium collections in the previous year, but with aceiling of 27 percent The monthly Part B premium amount currently is set inlaw through, the end of calendar year 1995 ($36.60 in CY93, $41.10 in CY94,$46.10 in CY95), and premium collections are projected to cover about 27.5percent of program COW in 1995. When originally established, SMI premiumswere intended to cover 50 percent of program% costs. They etoded significantlyover the years, however, and TEFRA 1982 established a temporary 25 percentpremium floor, beginning in 1984. Congress extended the floor twice, andOBRA90 set fixed premium amounts in law through 1995 at levels thenestimated to be approximately 25 percent of program eters. Beginning in 1996,calculation of the premiwn is scheduled to increase by the lower of the OAS1COLA adjustment to the previous year's premium, or to be set at 50 percent ofprogram costs. Estimated savings: add-on payment that hospital-based home health agencies(HHAs) receive in addition to payment under the Medicare cost limits.Eliminating the add-on would create a level playing field on which all homehealth agencies can compete. Estimated savings: over four eliminate tbe Medicare payment policy that pays proprietaryskilled nursing facilities (SNEs) a return on equity (ROE) invesied in the SNF.Medicare should pay for services rendeted to beneficiaries; it should private investment. Estimated fcur years$560 million;1997$160 million.HILS/Lower IME M 5.0 permed. This proposal would gradually lower theMedicare indirect medical education (1ME) from 7.7 percent to 5.65 percent foreach .1 increase in the intern and resident to be a ratio (1RB ratio). Teachinghospitals currently receive an additional 7.7 percent payment to the MedicareDRG payment for each .1 increase in their BIB ratio, above their base yearTbe adjustment is intended to compensate these hospitals for the highercosts of delivering care incurred by inexperienced midgets. In addition,teaching hospitals tend to have sicker case mixes than non-teaching hospitals.The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Proopective Payment ASSENMelliConunimion (ProPAC) have both found thst the 7.7 percent adjustmentovercompensates teaching hospitals for these costa and have recommended thatthe adjustment be reduced. ProPAC has recommended setting the adjustment at5.4 percent Lowering the 1ME adjustment would also encourage leechinghoopitals to instill within their residents more cost-effective patterns of care at an 95 261 What We Most Now De early stage in the rasidency. Estimated savings: over four years-51.94 billion;1997SM biboratory fee update. This proposal wouldextend the 2 percent annual update of Medicare reimbursement rates for clinicallaboratory services. OBRA 90 established a 2 percent update through the end of1993, after which laboratory fees woald be updated by the urban component ofthe Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), Approximately 3.5 percent annually. There isno evideoce, however, to indicate eat laboratory costs are increasing by the rateof inflation. Medicare payments so laboratories should more closely reflectdecreasing coats due to techocIcgical advances, such as increased automation,and changea in the market, such as lower-cost equipment Medicare payments tolaboratories are already excessive. An OIG study found that Medicare paidlaboratories 90 percent more than physicians paid for the same tests. Moreover,a GAO study indicated that laboratories use higher profits from Medicare tosubsidize discounts to other, private payers. Estimated savings: over fouryears-5740 million; 1997-5380 million.11115/Provide incenthy to encourage submission of claims via ekctronicformat. In total, Medicare Part B outlays were projected to be $59.8 billion in1993. The proposal would save 0.1 percent of the 1994-98 Medicare Part Bbaseline. The proposal would encourage physicians and other Part B providers tosubmit claims via the more administratively efficient electronic format bycharging physicians and other providers SI for each paper claim filed. Theproposal would not take effect until January 1, 1996, to give providers lead timeto adjust their filing systems. Estimated savings: over four years-5265 million;1997-5175 million.IIHS/Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) reforms. The MSP requirementscurrently vary depending upon the category of enrollee. This proposal wouldcreate a consistent MSP threshold for the aged, disabled, and end stage renaldisease (ESRD) patientsall employers of 20 or more would be primary payers.Current law already requires that Medicate enrollees with employer-based healthinsurance use their private health insurance before drawing upon their Medicarepolicies. This applies more consistent standards and more efficient enforcementof these provisions to save Medicare costs. Estimated savings are $947 millionfor 1994 through 1997; and $305 million in 1997.1111S/Permameady extend reduction of payments for hospital oacoaticostsetWces by Id parasol. OBRA 1990 reduced Medicare reimbursement forhospital outpatient department (OPD) reasonable costs by 5.8 percent through1995. This proposal would extend that provision permanently. Depending on theservice, OPDs ate paid based upon varying fotmulas, some of which take intoaccount the OPDs' reasonable costs. The overall reduction to OPDs would bemuch less than 5.8 percent, because less than half of Medicare reimbursement isbased on reasonable casts. &CAME hoepital inpatient reimbutsernent rates areconstrained by DRGs, hospitals have shifted services and coats to the outpatientsetting. As a reault, outpatient services aze one of the fastest growing 2,65 262 What We Mast Now Do components of the Medicare program, rising by an average of 17 percent peryear in the 1980s. Legislators approved a 5.8 percent reduction in OBRA 1990in an attempt to counter this rapid growth. If this provision is allowed to expire,outpatient costs, which continue to grow in the double-digits, will start growingeven fastet Support for this proposal is well-established through previouslyapproved legislation. Estimated savings are $950 million for 1994 through 1997;and $525 million in 1997.HIIS/Reduce hospital outpatient department reimbursement by am additional4.2 perceut. In total, Medicare Part B outlays were projected to be $59.8 billionin 1993. The proposal would save 0.5 percent of the 1994-98 outpatient servicesbase. Currently, Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services is based in paston the OPD's reasonable costs minus 5.8 percent, while reimbursement foroutpatient capital costs is reduced by 10 percent This proposal would reducereimbursementqr OPD services by an additional 4.2 percent beginning in 1996,to a 10 percent reduction. This would make payment for both categoriesconsistent by reimbursing both at 90 percent of overfour years-5690 million; 1997-5375 million.HIIS/Ban physician self-referrals. A Physicians may not refer a Medicare orMedicaid patient to a clinical laboratory in which the physician or thephysician's relatives have a financial interest Several exceptions are specified instatute. This proposal would extend ownership and referral prohibitions toadditional services, such as physical and occupational therapy, durable medicalequipment, and parenterallenteral nutrition equipment and supplies. Estimatedsavings: million; 1997-5100 million.NHS/Set EPO at non-U.S maricet rates The proposal would reduce theamount Medicare pays for esythropoietin (EPO) from $11 per 1,000 units to $10per 1,000 units. EPO is the drug used by patients suffering from kidney failure,to counter anemia by increasing the body's production of red blood cells.Medicare is virtually the sole purchaser of EPO and should exercise its marketpower to pay reasonable costs while maintaining access for all Medicarebeneficiaries. Estimated 1997 savings are $50 million. Estimated savings1994-1997-5160 million; savings for 1994-1998$210 million.HHS/Resource-based practice expense phase-in. This proposal is an interimstep toward a resource-based system for practice expenses. It would reducepractice expenses in relation to the relative value work units by one-half of thedifference between practice expense and physician work relative value units,rent no lower than 110 percent. Phase-in to a resource-based system for practiceor overvalued expenses under the physician fee schedule would begin in 1997.The recently implemented physician payment reform system divided paymentinto three distinct componentsoverhead, work, and malpractice expenses. Thework component is based on an extensively-researched relative value system,developed in 1991. The existing practice expense component is based upon anobsolete fee schedule and bears no relationship to the reformed work componentof the foe schedule. This proposal would only reduce the practice component in 26697 263 What We Mast Now Do extreme instanceswhen it exceeds the value of the work component Morecomprehensive reform of the practice component is expected to take severalyears to develop.

Quality of cue would be improved and =necessaryutilization would be minimized. Estimated 1997 savings are $160 million;1994-1997-5390 million.HMS/Sink fee for surgery. The fee paid to a primary surgeon would bereduced by the amount paid to assistants-at-surgery. MIS would establishexceptions by regulation in which the difficulty of the procedure cr the conditionof the patient necessitated the use of physicians as assistants-at-surgery. Whetherassistants are used and what type of personnel are used are primarily dependentcn geographic practice patterns and the practice styles of individual surgeons,rather than on characteristics related to the specific patient and the surgesyperformed. Evidence does not show that quality of care would be jeopardized.Estimated 1997 savings is $120 fee schedules for DME would be adjusted downward with an upperlimit baud upon the median DME fee schedule, rather than the national average.The fee schedule for prosthetics and \u00b0Modes would also be recompute, with anational median cap. The MIS Secretary would be authorized to adjust DMErates based upon market factors, including surveys of what other providers, suchas the VA, DoD and the private sector, pay for DME. The Secretary also wouldbe authorized to initiate competitive bidding programs for DME supplies whereappropriate. Granting broader /MS discretion would allow adjustments to bemade to reflect changes in technolopy, utilization patterns and other marketfactors. Estimated savings are $510 million for 1994-97; and $160 million in1997.NHS/Direct medical education. This proposal would base Medicare directmedical education payments on a national per resident amount derived solelyfrom the average of salaries paid to residents. Direct medical educationpayments would reflect differential weighing of the national average residentsalary, based on the specialty area a resident is pursuing and the length of theresidency. A resident in a primary care specialty would be weighted at 240percent, a non-primary cue resident in the initial residency period would beweighted at 140 percent, and a non-primary care resident beyond the initialresidency period would be weighted at 100 percent The average weight wouldbe 175 percent of the national average resident salary, down from the average 2 6 264 What W.

The proposal initially would limitthe Medicare Part B laboratory fee schedule to 76 percent of the median of allfees (as opposed to current maximum of 88 percent). Later, bas.A on marketsurveys, the Secretary of HHS would adjust Medicare payment rates tolaboratories to account for technological changes or other market factors. Thisproposal would address excessive Medicare payments for laboratory tests. AnOIG study found that Medicare paid laboratories 90 percent more thanphysicians paid for the same tests. Moreover, a GAO study indicated thatlaboratories use higher profits from Medicare to subsidize discounts to privatepayers. In addition, the proposal would control growth in Medicare Part Blaboratory payments, which more than doubled from 1985 to 1990. Estimatedsavings: over four years-83.1 billion; 1997-41.1 billion.MM./Reduce defer* Medicare volume performance standard and update. Theeffect of this proposal is to reduce the amount of increases in physician fees infuture years. This proposal would reduce the Medicare volume perfotmancestandard (MVPS) default formula and the defauft update for Medicare paymentsto physicians. These two factors determine annual aggregate physician paymentlevels. Estimated savings: over four yearsS850 million; 1997-8650 million.HIIS/Pennanendy extend three current Medicare Secondary Payer (MSI9ph...visions. The proposal would extend three OBRA '90 Medicare SecondaryPayer provisions due to expire at the end of 1995 including: (1) 1862(b) of theSocial Security Act authorizing MSP for disabled active individuals withemployer group health plan (EGHP) coverage; (2) 1826(c) of the Social SecurityAct amended '90 authorizing MSP for individuals with ESRD after18 months and (3) OBRA '90 authorizingan IRS/SSA data match for MSP. The data match authorizes access to tax data toidentify the existence of EGHP for MSP purposes.

Under current law, the update for urban hospitals will equal themarket basket rate of increase in 1994 and 1995. For rural hospitals the updateis set at market basket plus 13 percent for 1994 and the HMBI plus anadjustment needed to match the urban rate in 1995. Estimated savings: over fouryears-85.19 billion; 1997-81.7 billion.11115 and others: Third party liabilityenitanced identification of other healthcoverage. Federal and State taxpayers spend over 81.5 billion a year for healthcare that should be paid for by others. Inappropriate payments have beenidentified in most federally-assisted or financed health programs including:Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs Health, CHAMPUS/DOD Direct Care, andthe Indian Health Service. This proposal removes many of the structuralimpediments hindering proper identification and billing of third party liability(TPL) by: (1) requiring employers to report employment based health coveragedata annually on the W-2; (2) granting access to this data to all federally-assistedand financed health programs; (3) reinforcing existing coordination of benefits(which payer pays nd in what order) laws and regulations; and (4) removingimpediments that hinder states from collecting from ptivate insurers. Rather thanthe current 'pay and chase' procedures where federal programs pay first andchase payers afterwards, this proposal focusser on avoiding erroneous paymentsby identifying the appropriate coverage before paymentMedicaid:HMS/Tighten estate recovery/transfer of assets rules. Total Federal Medicaidoutlays for 1993 are projected to be 880.3 billion. This proposal would saveapproximately 0.1 percent of the 1994-98 Medicaid baseline. This proposalwould suengthen transfer-of-asset rules to restrict further the diverting ofproperty to qualify, for Medicaid. In addition, the Federal government wouldrequire States to operate estate recovery programs and would enhance States'abilities to implement these programs. Estimated savings: over four years-8395million; 1997-8155 million-/MS/Remove prohibition on State use of drug formularks. This proposalwould repeal the OBRA 1990 statutory provisions that prohibit States fromusing formularies. Before OBRA 1990, States were allowed to limit the numberof drugs listed on their fotmularies, e.g., States could cover only the genericalternative of a multiple-source drug. The OBRA 1990 formulary restrictionresulted in increased expenditures for States and savings: over four dift.This proposal wouldensure that personal care remains an optional benefit after 1994. The Medicaidstatute requires States to cover home health services for all individuals who areeligible for nursing home services. Currently, States also have the option to payfor personal care services to these individuals. Due to a legislative drafting eiror, 100 269 266 Wbat W. Myst New De OBRA-90 designated personal care as a home health service. Therefore,coverage of personal care services would become mandatory for all States in1995, if Congress does not amend the statute. In an era of increasing fiscalpressures and growing Medicaid spending, Congress should avoid imposingadditional mandates upon State Medicaid programs. Moreover, maintainingpersonal care as an optional service would allow Slates continued flexibility indesigning and administering Medicaid long-tetm care strategies. Estimatedsavings: for four years.S4.1 billion; 1997-813 billion.SharedContributionFor deficit reduction to succeed, all groups must contribute. Only if there is asharing of the load can the entire countiy be sure that everyone is participating.Social Security/Conforns titration of benefits to private pensions. Up to 50percent of Social Security and Railroad Retirement (Tier I) benefits are currentlyincluded in taxable income for those recipients with income and benefitsexceeding $25,000 for individuals, and $32,000 for couples. The Administrationproposes including up to 85 percent of benefits in adjuste. gross :mom, forthose with income and benefits exceeding the current S25,000/$32,000thresholds. This would move the treatment of Social Security and RailroadRetirement Tier 1 benefits toward that of private pensions. Under current law,pension benefits that exceed an employee's after-tax contributions to qualifiedpension plans are subject to tax at disttibution. Extending this approach to SocialSecurity would mean including at least 85 percent of benefits in taxable incomefor nearly all recipients. However, maintaining the existing income threshoklsprotects most low- and middle-income beneficiaries from benefit taxation.IMS/Strengthening child support enforcement. Of the over 10 million womenliving alone with their children, only half have child support orders and onlyhalf of those women receive full payment. Child support enforcement will bestrengthened by streamlining paternity establishment; ubing the IRS to collectseriously delinquent child support; making sure that absent parents who can paychild support do; setting up a national registry to track down deadbeat parents;requiring employees to report child support obligations on IRS W-4 forms; andimproving medical support for children. Better child support enforcement willensure both parents' responsibility for the well being of their children anddecrease the burden of welfare on the taxpayer. Estimated Savings: over fouryears$328 million; 1997$109 million..HIIS/Equate matching rates for welfare programs. Currently, States arereimbursed by the Federal Government at different rates for the various costs ofadministering Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps,and Medicaid. The Administration proposes to set the Federal reimbursementrate at a uniform 50 percent for all administrative costs of each of these threeprograms. There will be waivers for some States, in hardship cases. Estimatedsavings: over four years$1.8 billion; 1997-4600 million. 2 7101 267 Wistt We Must Do OPM/End hunp-sam benefit retirement. The lump-sum retirement optionallows Federal civilian employees to elect upon retirement to receive a lumpsum roughly equal to employee contrtbutions in exchange for a reduced annuityfor life. The Ommbus Budget Reconciliation Act suspended the lump sum for 5years, through 1995, for all employees except those who are critically ill,involuntarily separated or activated for Desert Shield/Storm. This proposalwould eliminate the lamp sum for all employees retiring on or after October 1,1995. Estimated 1994-97 savings: $5.1 billion. Estimated 1997 savings: $3billion.Veterans Affairs/Permanently extend medical care cost recovery. The VAoperates a nationwide health care delivery system for our nation's veterans. Thisproposal would make permanent VA's authority to collect the coct of medicalcare from health insurers of veterans with service-connected (military related)disabilities when the care is provided for non-service-connected conditions. Thisproposal would hold private health insurance companies responsible for the costsof their beneficiaries' care. VA already has permanent authorization to collectcosts ftom insurers of veterans without prescription ckarge/copayment. The VAoperates a nationwide health care delivery system for our nation's veterans. Thisproposal would make permanent VA's authority to collect from most veterans a$2 copayment for each 30-day supply of outpatient prescription drugs that is notrelated to treatment of a service-connected (military related) disability. Costsharing encourages more appropriate utilization a prescription drugs. Thisproposal has been enacted three times by the Congress (currently through 1997).Estimated savings in 1998$42 million. 271 268 The Role of Health Care Costs Even the most favorable scenarios for economic growth under our plan leaveunfmished business, however. The budget totals conceal rapidly rising healthcare spending that threatens to bankrupt our national treasury.Recently, heat% care cosh have accounted for almost half of the inctrase inFederal spending; if we do nothing, by decade's end one in every four Federaldollars will go to providing health care. Relentlessly rising coats will continue tostunt long-term economic growthand terrorize American familiestmless anduntil we achieve fundamental change.Later this spring we will deliver to the Congress a comprehensive plan forchange. That plan will control health care costs and will provide security tofamilies, so that they cannot be denied the coverage they need. It will root outfraud and outrageous charges, and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes 116 272 269 The Task Rents Wig consumers or doctors. And it will maintain American standardsthe highestquality medical care in the world, and the choices we all deserve.Our health care plan will bring costs under control. And while the savings weachieve will go mostly to the private sector, taxpayers will benefit as well.Federal funds will be freed for investments in education, training, and thetechnologies of tomorrow.That reform will control the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending in thelong term, and thereby supplement the deficit reduction in this economicprogram. If the growth of Federal health care costs can be limited to the rate ofgrowth of the population, plus the rate of inflation, plus two percent, the deficitwill decline in dollar terms and as a percentage of the GDP (Charts 4-1 and4-2); and the increase in the ratio of the national debt to the GDP of the 1980swill be reversed (Chart 4-3).Enactment of the economic plan and health care reform together will reverse thefailures of the 1980s, and put the economy on a sound footing for the nextcentury. It will reduce the threat of financial instability posed by a national debtrising faster than our income. It will stop sending the signal to the rest of theindustrialized world that our economic policy is out of control. Most important,it will add to the prosperity and security of the American people and allow us tocompete more effectively in the global economy. Conclusion: A Vision of Change for America Throughout our history, at every critical moment, Americans have summonedthe courage to change, to adapt our nation's policies and institutions to changingproblems and a changing world. Once again we face such a challenge. Now wemust change our course.We need a change to restore what makes America great: a vision of economicand political freedom; of the rewards of hard work and initiative; of afundamental sense of fairness, of our families and our communities asfoundations of our strength; and of every generation's obligation to create abetter life for those that follow.The plan we present invests in our people sag promises an America where agrowing economy produces rising living standards and high-wage, high-skilljobs. It rewards hard work and restores fairness, providing opportunity in returnfor responsibility. It ends twelve years of government that served only theprivileged and returns that government to its rightful owners: the Americanpeople.Here in Washington, the powerful special interests are already doing their bestto suffocate change. They oppose it because they profit from the status quo.They refuse to listen to the American people's call for change. 273117 271 Tbe Task Rematahug Chart 4-I.

In 1965, nationalhealth spending constituted less than 6 per-cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), butby 1990 it had expanded to more than 12 per-cent of GDP. Assuming that current govern-ment policies remain in force, and that medi-cal practice and private health insurancetrends continue, the Congressional BudgetOffice ((TO) projects that national healthspending will reach 18 percent of GDP by theyear 2000, or almost $1.7 trillion. As healthspending continues to grow, concerns mountabout its financial impacts on consumers,businesses, and governments.Despite recent weakness in the economy,employment and incomes in the health sectorhave increased at striking rates. The totalnumber ofjobs in the health sector of the econ-omy increased by 639.000 from May 1990through May 1992, while the total number ofjobs in the economy fell by almost 1.8 millionand the number of nonhealth jobs fell by 2.4million. According to the American MedicalAssociation, the average net income ofphysicians (after subtracting office expenses,malpractice insurance premiums, and thelike) in 1990 was $164,000, up from $98,000 in1982--an average annual growth rate of 6.6percent. By comparison, the average pay of allfull-time workers increased from $18,500 to$25,900 during the sawo period, a growth rateof only 4.3 percent a year. Similarly, commu-nity hospital margins (the net of revenues lessexpenses) reported by the American HospitalAssociation were 5.2 percent in 1991, higherthan their 20-year average of 4.2 percent.Health expenditures generally grow moreapidly than spending in most other parts ofthe economy, largely because of what econo-mists call market failure.This failure hasallowed rapid technological change that tendsto inflate rather than save costs, an unrelent-ing expansion of services provided during eachdoctor visit or hospital stay, and large in-creases in fees paid to health care providers.The aging of the U.S. population contributesto higher spending on health care becauseolder patients use a disproportionate amountof health services, but in the next decade theimpact of the aging population will increasehealth spending only modestly. Increases inhospital stays and physician visits that can beexpected because the population is aging arelikely to account for only a small part of in-creased health spending.Health insurance, the nation's primarymethod of financing health care, is one sourceof market failure that prevents the usualworkings of competition. It permits the rapidapplication of new and expensive proceduresand helps insulate providers from price com-petition.Collective payment through insur-ance is a natural response to the possibility oflarge and uncertain health care expenses.When an insurance company or government Reprinted from Projectionsof NatiOnal Health Expenditures, by theCongressional Budget Office. Washington, 1992. p. ix-xiii, 1-12, 37-46. Is 299 x PROJECTIONS OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES October1992program pays the bills, however, patients andhealth providers have less incentive to controlcosta carefully.Another source of market failure is the dele-gation of much decisionmaking to providers.Patients who have little medical expertise arehappy to benefit from whatever treatmentsproviders recommend when the insurance willpay the bill. And even if they wish to do bene-fit-cost calculations, patients are often unablete judge the appropriateness, quality, or priceof a health service.Because the competitive market has failed,health spending cannot be assumed to repre-sent well-informed demands by consumers orefficient provision of services by providers.Many of these attributes of U.S. health mar-kets are not unique to this country or even tothe health industry.Regulatory agenciesoversee other industries where competitivemarkets do not function, such as public utili-ties.In other countries, budgets, regulatoryconstraints, or other countervailing forceshelp prevent health expenditures from spiral-ing out of control. In this country, however,cost-containing pressures operate only onparts of the sector, and their overall impact isdiluted. National HealthExpendituresTotal spending on health is projected to reachalmost $1.7 trillion in 2000, compared withabout $800 billion in 1992. One can look atthe projections from two points of view:oType of spending-hospital care, physi-cian services, and so forth, andoSource of funding--private or public.Projections by Type of SpendingHospital, physician, drug, and nursing homeexpenditures accounted for almost 76 percentIf national health spending in 1990 (see Sum-mary Table 1 for CBO's baseline health spend-ing projections claasified by major type ofspending).CHO projects that hospital spending will in-crease at an average rate of 10 percent a yearin the 1990s, up slightly from 9.5 percent inthe 1980s (see Summary Table 1). The shifttoward use of outpatient services is expectedto continue, with the number of outpatienthospital visits increasing almost 5 percent ayear. The occupancy rate for community hos-pitals is projected to remain below 65 percent--despite reductions in the number of availablebeds--as the rate of inpatient admissions perperson continues to fall and the averagelength of a hospital stay drifts lower.Spending on physician services is expectedto increase at an average annual rate of 9.7percent in the 1990s, down from 11.6 percentin the 1980s. Increases in physicians' charges,additional procedures per doctor visit, and thecontinual increase in the complexity or inten-sity of treatments provided in doctors' officesaccount for almost nine-tenths of the total in-crease in this spending. Changes in the demo-graphic composition of the population and anincreasing number of doctor visits per personcontribute little to the growth of spending forphysician services.Spending on drugs, which is characterizedby a high proportion of out-of-pocket pay-ments, is projected to grow by about 7.5 per-cent a year in the 1990s. Spending on nursinghome care is projected to grow 10 percent an-nually in the 1990s, even as financing con-straints and the reluctance of states to ap-prove new construction prevent the number ofbeds from keeping up with the demands of theaging population. 3 3 300 SUMMARY xiProjections by Source of FundsThe main sources of funds in the health sector,accounting for more than 80 percent of totalhealth spending, are out-of-pocket paymentsby patients, private health insurance pay-ments, and Medicare and Medicaid (see Sum-mary Table 2 for a division of national spend-ing projections into private and governmentfunds).CBC) projects that the number of people cov-ered by private healthinsurance willincreaseslowly, and enrollment in the major govern-ment health insurance programa, especiallyMedicaid, will grow strongly. Encouraged byfederal tax policy, private health insurancecoverage increased steadily until the 1980s.Since the 1981-1982 recession, however, pri-vate health insurance benefits have stabilizedas a share of health expenditures, and the Summary Table 1.Projections of National Health Expenditures, by Type of Spending Type of Spelding 1965 Hospital 14Physician 8Drugs, of Dollars10242222064168743634110 2502561265553177423666310153636521841620478872876713161111374448081,0721,679 Average Annual Growth from Previous Year Shown (Percent)HospitalPhysicianDrugs, Other NondurablesNursing HomeAll OtherNational Health Expenditure MemorandcbGross Domestic Product(Billions dollars) 703Average Annual Growth ofCross Domestic Product (Percent) n.a.Ratio of National add to totals because of rounding. a.ProvidedbEconomic assurnptions reflect the Congressional Budget Office baseline of January 199210.310.07.510.39.710.19.17.49.59.19.99.4 7,1049,322 6.25.6 15.118.0 4 301 xii PROJECTIONS OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES October 1992Summary Table 2.Projections of National Health Expenditures, by Source of Funds Selected Calendar Years Source of Funds 19651980198519901992a199512000.Billions of DollarsPrivate 31145248384441574869 PublicFederal 572124195253343566 PublicFederal 11.628.829.229.331.332.033.7 State and local 13.2Th.-12.113.114.214.514.5Total, National 100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0 Average Annual Growth Rate from Previous Year Shown (Percent)Private 10.811.39.17.29.28.7 PublicFederal 19.711.49.613.710.710.5 State and local Domestic Product(Billions of dollars) 7032,7084,0395,5145,9317,1049,322Average Annual Growth ofGross Domestic Product (Percent) n.a.9.48.36.43.76.25.6Ratio of National Health Expendituresto Gross Domestic Product 5.99.210.512.113.615.118.0SOURCE.Congressional tudget OfficeNOTES:n.. = not applicable.

CSC) projects that the other major com-ponent of private funding--direct out-of-pocketpayments by patients to providerswill con-tinue to grow at slower rates, constrained bylimited growth in patients' incomes.CB0 expects that in the 1990e private fund-ing of health care will shrink as a share of na-tional health expenditures. The proportion ofpeople receiving health coverage through gov-ernment programs and the share of nationalhealth spending by governments will grow.These projections of national health expen-ditures incorporate CBO's January 1992 base-line for spending on the Medicare and Medic-aid programs. Medicare inpatient hospitalspending is expected to resume growth rates of9 percent to 10 percent a year in the 1990s,after a period of slower growth in the 1980e.Active cost containment efforts in the 1980etemporarily reduced the growth in Medicarehospital spending, but the impact of theseefforts had waned by the end of the decade.CBO assumes that the introduction of reformsin Medicare payments to physicians in 1992will not restrain Medicare payments signifi-cantly, although payments in some physicianspecialties and regions of the country may benoticeably changed. Aside from physicianpayment reform, current law provides no ma-jor cost-containing changes during the 1990s.CB0 expects the growth of Medicaid to slowfrom its current rapid rate--26 percent pro-jected for 1992 aloneto an annual rate of 12percent by the year 2000. Medicaid remainsthe fastest growing source of funds for na-tional health expenditures, and CBO projectsthat its share of payments will rise from 11percent in 1990 to almost 19 percent in 2000.This increase in payments is driven by a com-bination of recent expansions in eligibility,rising reimbursement rates mandated by 3 6the courts, and the weakening of privatehealth insurance coverage. ImplicationsIf present laws, institutional arrangements,and trends continue in the 1990s, the high coatof private health insurance will shrink theproportion of Americans who are privatelycovered and increase the number of peoplewith no insurance. Governments will pay alarger fraction of U.S. health spendingthrough the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Higher government spending on health carehas serious implications for the federal bud-get; the projected increase in health carespending outpaces the growth in any othermajor component of the budget and promisesnot only to preempt resources from other gov-ernment programs, but also to make deficit re-duction more difficult.People pay for government health spendingdirectly, through taxes, or indirectly, throughthe adverse effects of government deficitspending on capital formation and economicgrowth. People pay in a different sense whengovernment health spending preempts othergovernment expenditures, such as invest-ments in education and infrastructure or in-come maintenance programs. Similarly, em-ployees pay for employer-sponsored health in-surance indirectly, through wages and sala-ries they might otherwise have received in theabsence of coverage. The increasing cost ofhealth benefits has contributed to the slowgrowth in wages and salaries that many U.S.workers have experienced in recent years.Without significant changes in public policyand private behavior, rising spending onhealth care will continue to limit wage andsalary gains as private employers pour moneyinto higher health insurance premiums foremployees rather than into pay raises. 303 Chapter FourProjections of National HealthExpenditures by Source of Funds The government share of health spend-ing will increase in the 1990s undercurrent policies and the share of pri-vate payments will decline. CBO expectsstrong growth in Medicare payments despiteslower growth in the elderly population, andprojects that Medicaid paymen:s will con-tinue growing rapidly because r f increases inenrollments and court decis..ons rc quiringMedicaid programs to increase- payments.CBO projects that the number of people cov-ered by private health insurance will increaseslowly and the proportion of the populationcovered by private health insurance will con-tinue to decrease. As a result, private healthinsurance benefits, which had accounted for asteadily increasing share of health expendi-ture until the mid-1980s, are expected to payfor a slightly smaller share of health spendingby the end of the 19905. CBO projects that thenumber of uninsured people will increase fromabout 35 million in 1992 to more than 39 nil-lion in 2000, despite the growth in Medicareand Medicaid usee Table 10).CBO projects that direct out-of-pocket pay-ments by patients to providers will continuedeclining as a share of total health spending,despite the increase in the number of unin-sured people. Types of health spending thatare funded largely by out-of-pocket paymentstend to grow more slowly than hospital or phy-sician spending, which are heavily insured,and many of the newly uninsured will chooseto do without nonessential services and arenot in a position to pay large amounts for theservices they do receive.

The proportion of na-tional health expenditures paid directly bypatients has fallen from 45 percent in 1965(before Medicare and Medicaid) to 20 percent 4Congreuional Research Service.

Direct patientpayments will nevertheless rise more rapidlythan gross domestic product--from 2.5 percentof GDP in 1990 to 2.9 percent in 2C00--sincehealth spending is growing faster than GDP.Sectors with a high proportion of out-of-pocket payments--drugs, durables, and dentalservices--have shown slower growth inspending than sectors financed more heavilyby private health insurance or governmentsources. Payments of deductibles and coinsur-ance by insured patients are considered out-of-pocket payments.Insurance can allow patients to ignore costswhen receiving treatments, but direct patientpayments are subject to a stronger cost-benefitcalculation.In the estimates of nationalhealth expenditures, consumer payments ofprivate health insurance premiums (including 309 CHAPTER FOURPROJECTIONS OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES BY SOURCE OF FUNDS 43employee cost sharing of premium paymentssponsored by employers) are not classified asdirect out-of-pocket payments. Instead, thesepayments are included in the private healthinsurance account, and no attempt is made tocalculate the burden of private health insur-ance premiums on consumers. CB0 assumesthat consumers or workera ultimately bear theentire burden of private health insurance pay-ments regardless of whether employers or-ganize the coverage, or the amount of the ap-parent cost sharing of the premiums by em-ployees. Thus, even if employers are askingemployees to pay a greater share of theirhealth insurance premiums, the estimates ofout-of-pocket spending presented here are notaffected.Other Private PaymentsOther private payments include hospital non-patient revenues and philanthropy. As in thepast, other private payments are expected togrow at 9.1 percent in the 1990s, maintainingabout a 4.5 percent share of national healthexpenditures. Public FundingThe government's share of health care pay-ments has been growing faster than the pri-vate share. Payments per person partici-pating in government programs are growingat about the same rate as private health in-surance benefits per covered person, but thegovernment is becoming the primary payer fora greater proportion of the population (seeTable 13 for a breakdown of the sources offunds for national health expenditures withemphasis on public funding).FederalThe federal share of national expenditure onhealth care consists of the Medicare andMedicaid programs and smaller programssupporting public health, research, and theneeds of particular groups of people, such asveterans.5 Total federal health payments areexpected to rise from 29 percent of nationalhealth spending in 1990 to 34 percer.t in 2000.Medicare. CB0 projects that Medicarespending will grow at about 11 percent an-nually in the projection period, raising itsshare of national health expenditure from 17percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 2000.The federal Medicare program for the elder-ly has two parts: Hospital Insurance (HI, orPart A), which covers inpatient hospital care,and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI,or Part B), which covers mostly physician andoutpatient hospital services. Part A is largelyfunded by a payroll tax. About 75 percent ofPart B is funded from general revenues withthe other 25 percent from premiums paid bybeneficiaries.Medicare Part A spending for inpatient hos-pital care has grown relatively slowly sincethe mid-1980s when the prospective paymentsystem (PPS) was pa into effect. This systempays hospitals on the basis of a fixed fee ac-cording to the broad diagnosis of the patient,or diagnosis-related group (ORO). Peer re-view organizations were created to help pre-vent inappropriate admissions of Medicare pa-tients to hospitals. The PPS discourages hos-pitals from providing longer-term or mainte-nance care of the elderly in an inpatient set-ting, and admissions and lengths of stay forMedicare beneficiaries have fallen consider-ably since the system was started.CHO projects that Medicare Part A inpa-tient hospital payments will resume growingat 9 percent to 10 percent a year in the 1990s, 5.Payment& made by government agenciex for employeehealth inaurance are excludenutrition. anitation. and antipollution program. 11them are not directly related to the provision of medicalcare or treatment of disease.

Inpatient admissions per enrollee -..reexpected to resume growing, and DRG pay-ment rates are projected to increase morequickly than in the recent past. Inpatientadmissions of people over age 65 have fallenfrom 404 per thousand in 1983 to 350 perthousand in 1991, but CBO projects that ad-missions of elderly patients will grow to 374per thousand by 2000. Since 1986, MedicareDRG payment rates have been increased moreslowly than a price index (called the hospital\"market basket\" or \"input price index\") that isused to track hoepital operating costs. DRGrate increases were held below this price indexduring portions of the 1980s, but beginning in1995, according to current law, hospitals arescheduled to begin receiving DRG rate in-creases based on the full price index, whichwill add to Medicare costs.Medicare Part B has paid for physician ser-vices in the past, based on the reasonable andcustomary fees for the services provided in thephysician's locality.This system has beencriticized for making inequitable allocations ofpayments between primary and specialtyservices, and by region.6For example,Medicare paid for certain intensive techno-logical procedures and surgeries much moregenerously than it did for consultative visits.Medicare began changing its method of pay-ing physicians in 1992. The new system isbased on a fee schedule with set payments forservices, adjusted for differences in practicecosts in differe.,t parts of the country. The feesare based on an outside determination of therelative values of each service. A feature ofthe new system is that the fees are expected togrow according to a price index; if overall pay-ments grow more rapidly than a predeter-mined target rate in a year, the growth of feesfor succeeding years may be reduced. Al-though the Congressional Budget Office ex-pects some redistribution of payments amongphysician specialties and regions of the coun- 6.See. for example, Phyeician Payment Review Commaeion. AnnualReport to Congress (1991, p.1try, CBO projects only small reductions intotal payments to physicians from the newsystem. Part B payments for physicians,which total about two-thirds of Part B spend-ing, are projected to grow at about 12 percenta year during the 1990s.The second largest component of MedicarePart B is outpatient hospital payments, whichaccount for about 20 percent of Part B spend-ing. CEO projects that outpatient hospitalpayments on behe.lf of Medicare beneficiarieswill continue growing about 18 percent a yearin the projection period.Overall Part B ex-penditure stabilizes at a 13 percent a year rateof growth in the 1993-2000 period.Medicaid. Medicaid finances health care forsome of the nation's poor and is administeredby the states under broad federal guidelines.The states, which pay 43 percent of totalMedicaid costs, can exercise considerable dis-cretion in deciding whom and what to cover,and eligibility rules and coverage vary widely.Federal Medicaid spending has grown veryrapidly in receut years--21 percent in 1990, 29percent in 1991, and an estimated 26 percentin 1992. CEO projects that Medicaid growthwill slow to about 12 percent a year by 2000,but Medicaid's share of national health ex-penditures will rise from 11 percent in 1990 tomore than 19 percent in 2000.Population and cost pressures, legislatedextensions of eligibility, legal decisions re-quiring increased payments, and the fiscalpressures that push state and local govern-ments to get the most funds from the federalgovernment all drive rapid growth in Medic-aid spending.In the short term, the extra-ordinary growth between 1990 and 1993stems partly from so-called disproportionateshare payments and tax and donation pro-grams. Disproportionate share payments aresupplementary amounts allotted to hospitalsthat serve unusually large numbers of in-digent and uninsured patients. Legislationenacted in 1990 extended these payments andgave states great latitude to designate hos-pitals that qualify and placed some limits ontotal payments. Many states, too, have 315 312 46 PROJECTIONS OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES Octobor 1992discovered a mini-bonanza in tax and dona-tion programs since 1990. Such programs in-volve raising Medicaid reimbursements andsimultaneously levying special taxes on pro-viders. States have used such arrangementsas a tool to obtain the highest possible federalmatching payments. These complicated tac-tics were curtailed by Public Law 102-345, en-acted in 1991, which requires that any suchlevies be br,..id-based and caps the proportionof state Medicaid spending that states can fi-nance.But even after these extraordinary growthrates taper off, longer-run pressures persist.Recent expansions in eligibility, particularlyfor poor children, will continue to raise thenumber of people who are eligible. States maykeep shifting programs that they formerlyfunded for mental health, testing, and so forthinto Medicaid to gain the federal match.Many states now run outreach programs toalert potential beneficiaries to their eligi-bility. The impacts of provisions for nursinghome reform (enacted in 1987 but only re-cently effective) remain uncertain. And fi-nally, a rash of lawsuits has resulted in sharp-ly higher reimbursements under a 1980amendment requiring that Medicaid pay-ments to providers be \"reasonable and ade-quate.\" Pressures for increased Medicaid pay-ments will continue to inflate the costs of theprogram.Other Federal Funding. The Department ofDefense, the Department of Veterans Affairs(VA), and the National Institutes of Healthspend most of the rest of federal health funds.which CB0 expects will grow at about thesame rate as GDP in the projection period,from $41 billion in 1990 to $73 billion in 2000.CBO projects that slow growth in VA hospitalspending and declines in health insurance en-rollment through the Department of Defensewill help restrain the total cost.State and Local GovernmentFinancingCRO projects that total state and local fundingfor health will grow at double-digit ratesthrough the mid-1990e, before tapering off toabout 9 percent a year in 2000. These growthrates are considerably higher than the growthexpected in state and local revenues outside offederal Medicaid payments. Under currentpolicies, therefore, unless taxes are increased,states are likely to have very little room toexpand nonhealth spending.Medicaid. CB0 assumes that Medicaid coatsat the state and local level will grow at thesame rate as federal payments, and expectsthat the current ratio of state and local Medic-aid funding to federal--43 percent to 57 per-cent--will remain constant. States' efforts toincrease the effective federal matching ratethrough tax and donation schemes are not ex-pected to result in any further increase in thefederal share.Other State and Local Health Payments.Other expenditures by state and local govern-ments for health care include workers' com-pensation, direct support of public hospitalsand school health programs, and public healthefforts. CBO projects that state and localspending other than Medicaid will grow lessrapidly than national health expenditures asa whole. The other state and local share of na-tional health expenditures thus declines from8.2 percent in 1990 to 6.4 percent in 2000.Despite the declining share of total spendingon health, other state and local spending is ex-pected to grow more rapidly than GDP, aver-aging 7 percent growth a year in the 1990scompared with 5.4 percent average annualgrowth in GDP. 313 92-967 EPWDecember 23, 1992CRS and Richard PriceEducation DivisionNATIONALHEALTHEXPENDITURES, national health spending totalled $761.7 billion and aco3unted for13.2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

There are concerns that continued growth in healthcare costa could impede efforts to improve access to health care and couldeventually erode the access that already exists. While efforts to controlmedical spending have been a central issue in health policy at least since theearly 1970s, these concerns have given the issue a new urgency.Most proposals to limit health care spending have relied on one of fourbasic approaches. The first is to change the behavior of consumers by holdingthem directly responsible for a larger portion of the costs of their own care.Increases in required deductible and coinsurance payments by enrollees inhealth plans can reduce overall costs.However, they may have adisproportionate impact on low-income persons, deterring even necessary care,and may not affect the treatment decisions of providers, who control much oftotal health spending.The second major approach is to change provider behavior through directmodification of medical practice, or by controlling the overall supply of medicalresources.Insurers have had some success in controlling inpatient hospitalservices through external review systems, but savings have been largely offsetby a growth in outpatient services. These have proved harder to manage, inpart because there is little agreement about what constitutes appropriate care.There are hopes that further research on the effectiveness of medicaltreatments can provide a basis for limiting unnecessary care. If reductions inutilization are to achieve their full savings potential, however, they may needto be accompanied by controls on the overall supply of medical resources.Supply controls through local health planning systems were attempted in the1970s, but encountered political barriers and had limited success.The third cost control approach is to change prcrihr behavior throughreimbursement systems that provide incentives for greater efficiency. SeveralStates, as well as Canada and other nations, have adopted payment systemsthat fix in advance the resources a provider can consume in treating anindividual patient or an entire patient population. These systems mayencourage more cost-effective treatment, but may also delay the introductionof new medical technologies or otherwise compromise quality. Their long-term potential for cost savings may rest on the willingness of the public toaccept trade-offs between cost and other priorities.The last major approach is to encourage consumers to choose from amongmultiple health plans that compete on the basis of their ability to developstructured and efficient delivery systems. Health maintenance organizations(HMOs) and other managed care systems have shown some ability to controlcosts, using utilization controls, financial incentives for providers, and othermethods. The abiiiy of these programs to achieve their full savings potentialmay be limited by the reluctance of higher-cost patients to accept therestrictions on choice of providers imposed by HMOs. 317 CONTENTSINTRODUCTION 1COST SHARING 3CHANGING MEDICAL PRACTICE 5 External Utilization Controls 5 Modifying Practice Styles 8SUPPLY CONTROLS 11REIMBURSEMENT REFORM 16COMPETITION 20 Health Maintenance Organizations 22 Competition and Consumer Choice 26 3'21. 318 CONTROLLING HEALTH CARE COSTS INTRODUCTIONThe United States spends more per capita, and a greater proportion ofitsgross domestic product (GDP), on medical care than any otherinduetrialized nation. US. health expenditures in 1987 reached $500 billion,11.1 percent of GDP, at compared to 8.6 percent in Canada, 6.8 percent inJapan, and 6.1 percent in the United Kingdom.' Despite its higherexpenditures, the United States performs no better than other industrializednations, and worse than many, on such measures of h-Alth care outcomes aslife expectancy or infant mortality rates. These international comparisons have led many observers to conclude that our medical care system is muchless efficient than those elsewhere, spending more for less.Not everyone would agree. Gross measures of health status may reflect,not the relative efficiency of our medical care system, but other differencesbetween the United States and other countries. Life expectancy, for example,may be tied to diet or environment, while infant mortality rates may in partreflect such factors as the rate of teenage pregnancy. Other aspects of qualitymay not be captured by these measures at all. For example, Americans (or atleast insured Americans) may have greater access to advances in medicaltechnology than persons in other countries or may be less likely to have towait for non-emergency treatment. Assessing the efficiency of the Americansystem depends in part on how one defines quality, a problem that will beconsidered further at the end of this report.Whatever the relative quality of American medical care, there areconcerns about . the rate at which health expenditures are increasing.Inflation in the medical sector has outpaced inflation in the rest of theeconomy for many years. National health expenditures rose an average of 33percent a year from 1970 through 1981. The rate of growth declined over thenext several years,chiefly because of a decline ininpatient hospitaledmissions.Between 1984 and 1985 total costs rose just 7.9 percent, thelowest annual rate of increase since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaidin 1965 (though still greater than the growth in GDP). This moderation inexpenditure growth proved short-lived. Costs rose 9.8 percent in 1987, andemployers and insurers have reported dramatic cost increases over the next 'Schieber, George J., and Jean-Pierre Poullier.

For example, one recent survey has found that employers' averagecost per employee for health benefits rose 19 percent in 1988.2The return of double-digit medical care inflation after a temporary respitehas led to concerns that continued growth in medical care costs could impedeefforts to improve access to health care and could eventually erode the accessthat already exists. Many employers have already reduced their contributionto employees' insurance expenses, while the costs of public insuranceprograms are consuming an increasing share of State and Federal budgets.Proposals to extend coverage to the uninsured have raised concerns that anyexpansion of the insured population might lend a further impetus to medicalcare inflation, as did the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Whilethe issue of health care costs and ways of controlling them has been a centralone in health policy at least since the early 1970e, these recent developmentshave given the issue a new urgency.This report examines policy options for controlling the increase in healthcare costs by modifying the way medical care is delivered or financed. Mostproposals have relied on one of four basic approaches:Changing the behavior of consumers by holding them directlyresponsible for a larger portion of the costs of their own care;Changing provider behavior through direct modification of medicalpractice, or by controlling the overall supply of medical resources;Changing provider behavior through reimbursement systems thatprovide incentives for greater efficiency;Changing the behavior of both providers and consumers byencouraging consumers to chooKt from among multiple health plansthat compete on the basis of thoir ability to develop structured andefficient delivery systems.The remainder of this report provides an overview of the conceptsunderlying these basic approaches and the evidence available about theirability to achieve savings and their potential impact on access and quality ofcare.The r atest attention is devoted to the last of the four strategies,competition, because this approach has dominated policy discussion in recentyears.The report does not consider changes outside the health care deliverysystem that could directly or indirectly affect medical care expenditures. Forexample, the incidence of illness or injury might be reduced through publichealth or health education measures, stronger environmental controls, or 2Geisel, Jerry.Health Benefit Tab Rises 19% to New Htgh. 11, 1989.p. 1.323 320 CRS-3 improved safety regulation.Changes in the civil litigation system (i.e., malpractice reform) could reduce the practice of 'defensive medicine that is alleged to result in the performance of unnecessary tests or procedures. Such measures might well play an important role in any comprehensive initiativeto control medical care spending. They are omitted in order to allow thisreport to focus more directly on the medical care system itself and on proposals to change the way consumers and providers behave within thatsystem. COST MARINOProposals to hold consumers responsible for more of the costs of their own medical care begin with the premise that comprehensive insurancecoverage, largely funded by employers or government, has distorted the healthcare market by freeing consumers of any need to consider the utility or price of the services they are consuming. While not all observers share the view that growth in health care costs is driven by consumer choices, there are increasing calls for measures to encourage consumers to become more conscious of the price and utility of the medical services they use.There are two broad ways of doing so. The first is to require consumers to payhigher share of the premiums for their health care coverage, thus giving them an incentive to choose the most efficiently operated plan. This approach is the subject of the final section of this memorandum. The second method, considered in this section, is to make consumers pay more of the direct costs of the services they use by increasing the deductibles or coinsurance payments required under their insurance plans.Increases in enrollee coat-sharing responsibility can reduce overall medical expenditures onlyifthey deter some enrollees from obtaining care. Otherwise, they merely shift expenses from the insurer to the consumer.3 The major study of the impact of cost-sharing on health care utilization and costs was the Health Insurance Experiment (HEE) conducted between 1974 and 1982 by the RAND Corporation, under contract to the Health Care Financing Administration. The HIE randomly assigned 7,700 enrollees to a variety of health insurance plans, including a plan that included no cost- sharing (the 'free plan) and plans requiring coinsurance payments ranging from 25 to 95 percent (subject to overall limits on out-of-pocket expenditures). 'Deductibles have other behavioral effects that may also produce cost savings. Enrollees whose costs during a year exceed the deductible by only a small margin may not go to the trouble of filing a claim.Other enrollees who are careless in record-keeping may be unable to document all of their out- of-pocket expenditures and may therefore spend more than the nominal deductible before the insurance takes over. ,324 321 CRS-4 The key findings of the HIE were these:4Cost-sharing reduced the probability that individuals would seek carefor any particular medical condition. The strongest deterrent effectsoccurred among the poor, especially poor children. They were atleast 40 percent less likely to obtain care for a given condition thanchildren in the free plan.Cost-sharing deterred enrollees from obtaining both 'appropriate andInappropriate medical care. Low-income enrollees in the cost-sharing plans were less likely to seek care for conditions for whichmedical care is highly effective, as well as for conditions for whichmedical care is rarely effective. Thom in the cost-sharing plans hadworse outcomes for specific conditions (such as hypertension) thatcan be improved by medical treatment.While cost-sharing prevented enrollees from initiating an episode ofmedical care, it did not change the course of treatment once anindividual had entered the medical care system. Within any givenepisode of care, the cost-sharing enrollees received the same servicesand medications as other patients.These findings raise several important concerns about the utility of cost-sharing as an approach for reducing medical expenditures. First, as would beexpected, its impact is greatest on enrollees with the least income. This effectmight be modified by developing cost-sharing requirements that varied byIncome Such a system might be administratively cumbersome for employersor insurers. It might also defeat its own purpose, since cost-sharing may notreduce utilization unless it is financially burdensome. (The IDE enrollees inthe least burdensome coat-sharing plan actually incurred slightly higher coststhan those in the free plan.)Second, cost-sharing may deter necessary as well as unnecessary care.The goal of making consumers more prudent in their use of health cervicesmay demand a degree of sophistication about the value of different servicesthat not all enrollees possess. There have been attempts to develop morecarefully targetedcost-sharing systems,tocontrolonly inappropriateutilization or to channel utilization in particular ways. For example, a highercoinsurance amount may be imposed for emergency room visits, in order toprevent enrollees from using the emergency room for non-urgent care; thisapproach is common in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and has 'This summary is drawn from Lohr, Kathleen, et al.

It is not certain, however, that even such narrower measures will deter only unneceuary care.Finally, and perhaps most important from the perspective of costreduction, cost-sharing may not modify the course of care once treatment hasbegun, presumably because the decision-making has generally shifted from thepatient to the physician. This finding of the HIE is partly a result of thedesign of the experiment.Regardless of the level of cost-sharing required,each plan had an out-of-pocket limit, point beyond which the insurerassumed full responsibility for all further expenses. In the absence of sucha limit, enrollee* might have been more likely to decline the services orderedby their physicians. At the same time, however, the most severely ill wouldhave been subject to catastrophic financial losses.Most medical care costs are incurred by a small minority of patients.' Acost-sharing system without catastrophic limits will leave that minorityunprotected, while a system with limits on out-of-pocket expenses may have a minimal effect on the total costs of care once treatment has been initiated.The problem of controlling the costs of ongoing treatment is the subject ofthe next section. CHANGING MEDICAL PRACTICEBecause most medical care purchasing decisions are made by physiciansand other providers, rather than by the patients themselves, savings might beachieved if unnecessary services could be eliminated through external reviewof those decisions or through efforts to modify the providers' own decision- making.External Utilization ControlsThe term \"utilization controis\" embraces a variety of external constraintsimposed by a payer on the volume or nature of services furnished or ordered by providers.' These include: \"In 1978, 10 ptrcent of U.S. families accounted ff..r 67 percent of total health expenditures.U.S.Congress.Congressional Budget Office.

These include requirements that certain surgicalprocedures be performed on an outpatient basis, or that diagnostictests ordinarily required for inpatients be conducted before thepatient is admitted to the hospital.Utilization controls, especially pre-admission certification and concurrentreview, have become a standard feature of health insurance plans during the1980s. They are now used in the Medicare program, in 29 State Medicaidprograms (as of 1987), and in 72 percent of employer-sponsored health plans(as of 1988), up from 59 percent just a year earlier.' Despite the rapidadoption of utilization control systems by both public and private payers, theyhave received little systematic study, and evidence that they actually reducespending is limited. Pre-admission review has the strongest track record; onecontrolled study found that it produced net savings for an average employeegroup of 7.3 percent, with even higher savings for groups that had very highutilization before the programs were initiated.' The evidence on 'iome of theother approaches is less clear.

One observer has argued that, because technologies thatwere once available only in hospitals are now widely diffused in the community, the hospitalis no longer the appropriate focus of cost-containment efforts.At the same time, however, utilization controls forambulatory services have been slow to develop. In part, this is because most ambulatory services have relatively small prices. The administrative costs of reviewing each service may outweigh any potential savings.\" Some insurers have begun to require prior authorization for the most costly outpatient services, such as CAT scans or other msjor diagnostic procedures. Whether such measures are actually producing savings is not yet known.Utilization controls face another barrier that may be even more important than administrative costs: the subjective nature of medical practice. Each patient is somehow unique, and external reviewers may have difficulty overriding the clinical judgments of individual practitioners in specific cases.This may be especially true when they is little consensus about the most appropriate treatment for a given condition, a problem to be discussed in the next section. In any event, some observers have contendedthat a persistentphysician who isprepared to appeal a denial of authorization will often prevail. (The relative leverage of the individual practitioner may have been enhanced by recent legal decisions subjecting external utilization control agents to malpractice liability for denials of necessary care.) In consequence, utilization review may function as a delaying tactic rather than an absolute control, achieving savings only because some physicians will not take the trouble to protest the reviewers' decisions. The result has been termed 'rationing by inconvenience.'\" Such savings as are achieved may diminish over time as physicians become more skillful in dealing with the system.For this reason, some analysts have suggested that savings over a longer term may depend on the extent to which providers 'sign on\" to the concept \u00b0For a discussion of this issue, see Institute of Medicine.Controlling Costa and Changing Patient Care?

In tl 5 view, real utilization control will require voluntary changes in the way physicians practice medicine.Modifying Practice StylesBeginning in the 1970s, studies by Wennberg and others showed thatthere was substantial geographic variation in the rate of use of specifimedical or surgical procedures. For example, the rate of tonsillectomies inone area of New England was six times higher than the lowest rate in theregion.\"While some of the variation, uncovered in 'small area analysis\"might be attributable to differences in the incidence of illnese in differentpopulations, this explanation appeared to be insufficient to account for all thevariation; some other factors had to be at work. One hypothesis was thatphysicians in different areas had different \"practice styles. Each community had its own medical culture, its own characteristic way of diagnoeingtreating particular diseases or conditions. Physicians adopted ths! practica style of their community in the absence of firm and objective informationabout which treatment approach was actually superior.Other explanations have been offered for small area variations in medicalpractice; these will be discussed further below. However, the practice stylehypothesis has won many supporters and has led to proposals for controllingmedical care costs by (a) improving knowledge of the relative efficacy ofdifferent medical treatments and (b) disseminating this knowledge to practitioners in the expectation that they win modify their practice stylesaccordingly. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-239)establishes a new program within the Department of Health and HumanServices for research on the effectiveness of medical treatments and thedevelopment of practice guidelines. Not all of the proponents of this initiative view it as a cost-containment measure. Some view it chiefly as a possible way of improving quality of care, and therefore worth pursuingwhether or not any cost savings result. The following discussion, however,considers only the potential of medical practice research to reduce costs.To have a significant impact, guidelines will need to address areas of practice on which there is real disagreement among physicians. There havebeen some efforts in the past to codify elements of medical practice on which there already existed a consensus. However, if most physicians already agree on the best treatments, promulgating that agreement in the form ofguidelines may not have a measurable impact on medical practice. (This appears to have been the case, for example, with 1984 consensus report on 13Wennberg, John, and Alan Gittelsohn. Variations in Medical Care Among Small Areas, Scientific American, v. 246, Apr. 1982. p. 120-134. 3 9 \"-+ 326 CRS-9 the treatment of high blood pressure.\") For this reason, the treatmentresearch initiative will focus on conditions for which there is found to be awide variation in current practice. Because the Nation is just beginning todevote significant resources to research on the outcomes of alternative medicaltreatments, it may take time for researchers to reach agreement in caseswhere practice variation is the result of real scientific uncertainty. The fullpotential savings from this strategy might therefore be realized only over thelong term.Assuming that future research can resolve disagreements over appropriatetreatments, there would remain the task of inducing physicians to modifytheir practices voluntarily on the basis of the new findings. Some success inchanging practices has been reported when physicians have been introducedto guidelines through structured face-to-face educational programs conductedby respectk-d peers.\" Some other efforts that relied only on printed materialsto communicate practice recommendations have had disappointing results.Providers could be aware of and even approve the recommendations withoutmaking significant changes in practice. It is possible that some physicians may encounter barriers in implementing even guidelines with which theynominally agree. These may include concerns about malpractice liability, lackof the substitute skills or the special equipment needed to follow theguidelines, economic incentives, or pressure from patients.\" These barriersmight beovercomewithmore vigorouseducationalefforts.Still,countervailing economic and professional pressures may limit the willingnessor ability of physicians to comply voluntarily with treatment guidelines.One alternative is to use the results of outcomes research as the basis formandatory,ratherthan voluntary,guidelines--thatis,asa way of strengthening or broadening current utilization control programs. Proposalsto do so have met strong opposition from the medical community, on thegrounds that medicine cannot be reduced to a \"cookboole and that to compelphysicians to comply with fixed practice rules would stifle innovation.

Physicians who, over time, consistently furnished or ordered moreof certain services than others in the peer group would be targeted for closerscrutiny, to determine whether patterns of inappropriate utilization existed.Physicians found to be outliers might be the focus of special educationalefforts in the hopes of inducing voluntary change. Continued noncompliancemight trigger requirements that individual services receive prior authorizationor could even lead to exclusion from participation in a given public or privateinsurance program.How much could be saved if all inappropriate services were eliminated?Some studies have found very high rates of unnecessary care. For example, Chassin et al., in a thirteen-site study, found that 17 percent of all coronaryangiographieswereunnecessary;forotherprocedures,therateof inappropriate use was as high as 32 percent. They also found, however, thatthe unnecessary care explained only a small fraction of variations inutilizationacrossgeographicareas.Ifnoneoftheinappropriate angiographies had been performed, the area with the highest use of thisprocedure would still have had more than twice the number of angiographiesas the lowest-use area. The authors suggest that other factors must play apart in this difference:disease incidence, differences in the point at whichprimary care physicians decide to refer patients to specialists, or cultural orsocial differences in the stage at which patients sought care.\" Another multi-site study has found that, while practice style may explain differences inutilization of certain specific procedures, it does not explain overall differencesin per capita use of medical care in different areas. At the aggregate level,standard socioeconomic factors could explain much of the difference in use and intensity of services.'5These preliminary studies suggest that there could be underutilization ofservices in some areas, while there is overutilization of the same services inother areas.Treatment research could pinpoint, not only cases in whichunnecessary services could be eliminated, but also cases in which patientshave had insufficient access (whether physical or financial) to necessary care.

Precisely because there is uncertainty about the relative efficacy ofmany treatments, it may be too early to say whether optimal medicaltreatment would involve more or fewer services than are currently furnished. SUPPLY CONTROLSIfutilizationcontrolsor practiceguidelinessucceedinlimitingunnecessary care, the full potential savings from any reduction in the numberof services delivered may be realized only if there is a proportionate reductionin the resources used to provide those services. For example, changes in medical practice in the late 1970. and early 1980. led to a decline ininpatient hospital admiuions without a corresponding reduction in hospitalcapacity. The result in many areas has been underutilized facilities spreadingtheir fixed costs across a declining number of patients; while there are fewerpatients, the cost for each patient rises because the unused capacity must stillbe paid for.In addition, the existence of exceu capacity may generate continuingpressures to find some new way of using that capacity and restoringutilization to its previous levels.\" The view that the use of medical servicescould rise to fill any underused resources led to what was perhaps thedominant approach to cost containment in the 1970s: health planning, theregulation of facility construction and other capital expenditures.In 1964, New York became the first State to establish a certificate-of-need (CON) program, under which proposals to build a new facility or expandan existing one had to be approved by a government agency. Other Statesfollowed, and a 1972 amendment to the Social Security Act provided thatfacilities in those States proceeding with construction without obtaining aCON could be denied Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for their capitalexpenditures.Finally, the Health Planning and Resources Development Actin 1974 required all States to establish similar programs. This requirementwas repealed in 1986, along with all Federal support for State healthplanning programs.

From a Federal perspective, theadoption in 1983 of Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) forinpatient hospital services was expected to offer a different way of limitinghealth care resources; this approach is discussed further in the next section.\"Underlying this shift, however, were claims that health planning had beentried and bad failed, largely because of conflicting political pressures. Inmany areas, the oversupply of facilities was such that savings would haverequired, not just limits on new construction, but closure or consolidation ofexisting facilities. Few States were able to overcome the political resistanceto such closures.Attempts to limit duplication of services or the spread ofnew technologies often faced similar barriers; attempts to plan for therational distribution of resources on a regional basis had to confrontproviders' fears of losing to competitors and individual communities' desirecfor the most up-to-date facilities.\"CON programs did have some successes, particularly in constraining thegrowth in nursing home beds. Because State Medicaid programs are the major source of payment for nursing home care, States had a strong motiveto overcome the political barriers to supply constraint. In at least someStates, the CON process was explicitly seen as a Medicaid cost-containmentmeasure; the determination of the number of nursing home beds needed wasrelated to the maximum number of patients the State was prepared to cover.\"Even in this case, however, any savings were achieved by holding growth inbed supply below the rate of growth in the aged population. States generallydid not close down existing capacity. \"American Hospital Asoociation. State Issues Forum.State HealthPlanning Report.

However, not all of the problems with healthplanning are political ones.Effective planning may require a fullerunderstanding of the workings of the health care system than is currentlyavailable. That system is a dynamic on*, and decisions that seemed sensiblein the late 1970. have sometimes had unpredictable effects. For example,most planning programs focussed on institutional services in hoepitals andnursing homes, because thee* were the major sources of expenditure, and didlittle to control the capital expenditures of community-based physicians orclinics. The resulting growth in the availability of high-technology facilitiesoutside hospitals is one of the reasons that recent reductions in inpatientutilization have been offset by increased outpatient costs. (Some States arenow applying uniform rules across settings.)Moreover, a community's needs may change unpredictably. New Yorkwas more successful than most States in controlling inpatient bed supply; itwas one of the few States in which hospital closures occurred on a plannedbasis. While the number of community hospital beds nationally dropped 1.1percent between 1977 and 1987, the number in New York dropped 9.9percent.34New demands on these facilities in the 1980s, such as theappearance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and the rise indrug-related problems, have led to serious overcrowding in some New Yorkhospitals. The reported crisis in New York illustrates one of the potentialconstraints on the planning process. On the one hand, it may be necessaryto maintain enough excess capacity to meet unforeseen needs or randomfluctuations in demand. On the other hand, this excess capacity is costly tomaintain and may itself generate demand. If the supply of a given kind ofservice is sufficient that no one ever has to stand in line for it, then thesavings from health planning may be limited.The fullest potential savings from health planning would require a morecontroversial step:limiting the supply of health resources to the point atwhich patients may have to wait for some period to obtain needed but non-emergency services. The result is ''queueing,* the delays in surgery or high-cost diagnostic procedures that are alleged to occur to some extent in Canadaand to a greater extent in the United Kingdom. The degree to whichqueueing actually occurs in either country's health system has often beendebated by those who favor or oppose adoption of a similar system here.Some people say that essential care may be unavailable, while others arguethat resource limits merely oblige providers to set priorities and avoidunnecessary services. uAmerican Hospital Association. Hospital Statistics, 1978 and 1988editions. 331 CRS-14 Whatever the extent to which resources have been limited elsewhere,rationing of supply in the United States might raise concerns that are notas significant in countries where the entire population participates in a singleinsurance program. In those countries, everyone is in the same queue, andone's place in line is chiefly determined by the urgency or duration of one'sneed. (There are exceptions: one can step out of line in the United Kingdomby finding a private provider, and there are anecdotal accounts that someCanadians with sufficient resources may seek cars in the United States.)When queueing has occurred in the United States, however, places in linemay have been determined by financial resources.The facilities in New York reporting the greatest overcrowding have beenthose serving the poor and the uninsured. Similar effects may have resultedfrom health planning's major success, the control of nursing home bed supply.Because Medicaid payment is generally less than that available from privatepatients, nursing homes in areas with limited bed supply and high occupancyrates have an incentive to accept a private-pay patient when a vacancy occurs,while Medicaid beneficiaries may be unable to find a place. In 28 States,Medicaid administrators report that beneficiaries awaiting hospital dischargehad difficulty finding a nursing home bed.24 While supply constraints are notthe only factors limiting access to care for low-income Americans, they mayexacerbate existing problems. The acceptability of health planning as a costcontrol strategy may, then, depend in part on the extent to which supplylimitations are accompanied by efforts to make distribution of limitedresources more equitable.One other issue should be raised in the context of a discussion of healthresources:the debate over the possible oversupply of physicians and thepotential consequences of physician supply on health care costa. In 1980, theGraduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC)reported that the United States would have a surplus of 150,000 physiciansby the year 2000.28 The extent of the potential surplus has since been thesubject of continuing debate. There are questions about the extent to whichtechnology and the aging of the population could increase demand, or theadoption of utilization controls or managed care could decrease it.

Just as excesshospital bed capacity may generate more hoopital stays, this theory holds thata surplus of physicians all attempting to maintain their incomes would leadin the absence of any controlsto excess delivery of services. Repeatedefforts to demonstrate this have been inconclusive.' It is not clear thatphysicians actually modify their medical practice in order to maintain atarget income.\"Still, if the projected surplus does in fact appear, theremight be greater pressures on physicians to increase the number of servicesthey furnish to each patient. Some people believe that it may eventually benecessary to consider reducing the supply of physicians (or curtailing theirworking hours).This has actually been attempted in one Canadian province, BritishColumbia. A physician who wants to participate in the health program thatcovers all citizens of the province must have a billing account, and since 1985the number of accounts has been limited (limits vary by specialty andgeographic area). A physician who fails to obtain a billing number cannotearn a living as a physician. Critics of the system contend, however, thatBritish Columbia is merely exporting its physician surplus to other provincesor to the United States.' Given the political problems health planners in theUnited States have experienced in trying to close hospitals, it seems unlikelythat British Columbia's efforts could be reproduced here, with governmentregulators telling new medical school graduates to find some other profession.However, there are proposals to achieve the same goal through private means.Some of the more ambitious \"managed care agendas discussed in the final 27For contrasting views on these issues, see Schwartz, William B., FrankA.

For this resaon, the focus of reimbursementreform proposals is on developing pricing mechanisms that give providersincentives to control both volume and unit cost.This is generally accomplished by redefining the commodity the insureris purchasing. Instead of paying for individual units of service, the insurermakes one payment for an episode of care (as in Medicare's prospectivepayment system, PPS), for overall treatment of a patient during a given timeperiod (capitation), or for treatment of an entire population (as in Canada'sglobal budgeting system for hospitals). These approaches may be seen as aligned on an ascending scale depending on the degree of aggregation of theunit being purchased, with per-case payment at the low end and payment foran entire patient population at the other. In all cases, however, the aim isto define in advance the total amount of resources the provider may consumein furnishing treatment to a patient or group of patients.Per-case payment and capitation give the provider an incentive toperform more efficiently in treating individual patients, either reducing thecost of producing each unit of service or reducing the number of unitsfurnished to each patient.These approaches may therefore be seen asalternatives to external utilization controls. Global budgeting defines the total resources available for treating all patients, and may be seen as an '\u00b0For example, Alain Enthoven has characterized the \"buy right\" Walter McClure as requiring that \"good-quality, doctorsprosper while others are induced to retire.\" Enthoven, Alain C.

While some providers may be driven to improve their efficiency,others may instead respond to shortfalls in reimbursement from one payer byraising charges to other groups, those without the niarket power to dictateprices.The possibility of \"cost-shifting\" may mean that savings for onepurchaser are not translated into real reductions in total system expenditures.In a sufficiently competitive market, the providers' ability to engage inthis *cost-shifting\" may be limited. A hospital may face, not only paymentlimits under Medicare and Medicaid, but pressure from private insurers oremployer groups to grant price discounts in order to be assured of anadequate market share. Characteristics other than efficiency may determinea provider's success in the face of these competing demands. For example, asuburban non-teaching hospital with few uninsured patients may be at arelative advantage as compared to a center city teaching facility with a heavyuncompensated care load.Individual purchasers who reduce their costs byfavoring the suburban hospital may leave the society to find some othermeans of subsidizing essential facilities that are handicapped in pricecompetition.A system in which multiple payers negotiate individually with providersmay, then, lead either to cost-shifting or to a situation in which priceconcerns override other societal goals, such as medical education and charity 'In practice, the Canadian system uses both global budgeting and healthplanning. However, some of the rate regulation systems in the United Stateshave explicitly superseded the health planning system. A facility that hasobtained a certificate of need for expansion may proceed only if the ratecommission approves the necessary increase in capital costs. For a discussionof the interplay of planning and rate regulation, see Brown, Common SenseMeets Implementation.32As the Medicaid experience has shown, adoption of payment restraintsby a payer with too small a market share may reduce acess for the payer'senrollees.For example, low reimbursement rates are the major reasonphysicians decline to participate in the Medicaid program. See CongressionalResearch Service, Medicaid Source Book, p. 448-454.336 335 CRS-18 care. For this reason, some people argue that real efficiency can be achieved only if all payers are paying under the same rules.Uniform ratesetting is common in other industrialized nations, both those with single-payer health insurance systems (as in Canada) and those where many different entities provide insurance (as in West Germany).The experience in the United States is limited to experiments in a few States beginning in the 1970e. Federal waivers of Medicare and Medicaid rules made it poesible for those tion payers to participate in the programs on demonstration basis, while State laws compelled participation by private insurers and individual payers, resulting in an %II-payee system. Medicaid law now permit. any State to include Medicaid in such a system, and Medicare may be included if the State can show that its system controls costs as effectively as PPS.However, full \"all-payee systems continue only in Maryland and in part of New York State. Several other States operate 'partial-payee systems that include all payers except Medicare.0 These systems have generally used the price aggregation approaches described above. That is, they. either establish a rate for total treatment of a case (as under PPS) or they establish a total budget for a hospital during a year, setting prices for the hospital in such a way as to achieve a target revenue amount.It hes been shown that, in 6 States with ratesetting systems, annual increases in cost per admission were consistently 3 to 4 percentage points below the national average from 1976 to 1984.During the same period, however, other States saw a drop in admissions per capita, while admissions in the ratesetting States were stable. As a result, the difference in growth in per capita rates of spending was not so striking: per capita costs rose at an annual rate of 11.5 percent ayear in the ratesetting States and 1 3 percent a year in other States.34 In addition, the ratesetting States had much higher costs at the outset than most other States. Some observers have questioned whether ratesetting could have achieved comparable savings in areas where costs were lower to begin with\"Evidence from other countries with universal ratesetting systems suggests that greater savings may be possible. In Canada, where the provinces establish global budgets for each hospital, hospital expenditures per capita \"Maine's system takes hospitals' Medicare revenues into account when determining what the hospitals may charge other payers, thus achieving overall budgetary control without direct Medicare participation. This approach has recently survived a legal challenge by hospitals.'iSchramm, Carl J., Steven C. Renn, and Brian Biles. New Perspectives on State Rate-Setting.

(Similar systems inother industrial nations have been less successful)\" As admission rates arenot markedly lower, there is considerable uncertainty about the sources of thedifference. Some of the saving may be in administrative costa, simply becausethe hospitals do not need to meet the paperwork requirements of multiplepayers. The rest of the difference is often attributed to differences in theintensity of the services furnished to each patient. Whether these differencesreflect 'underservice\" in Canada or \"overservice' in the United States is thesubject of continuing debate.\"In a sense, the statistical evidence may be beside the point. An all-payersystem could in theory fix itsprices at any level, with the potentialconsequence of reduced access or quality if the prices are set too low. Theavailable data may thus be taken as indicating, not the savings that couldhypothetically be achieved, but the savings that were politically feasible inspecific States during a specific period. Continuing pressure by consumersand providers for the adoption of new medical technologies may limit theability of ratesetting systems to restrain expenditure growth over the longterm. Even in Canada, overall medical expenditures outpaced inflation by 2.9percent a year in the period 1980-87, almost the same as the 3.0 percentannual rate observed in the United States in the same years.' The ultimateefficacy of reimbursement controls may depend, in the same way that thesuccess of health planning depends, on the political will to constrain healthcare consumption.That political will might in turn depend on perceptions of the impact ofreimbursement controls on the quality of care. The effect of Medicare'sprospective payment system, for example, has been argued continuously sinceits implementation in 1983. One of the immediate responses of hospitals tothe incentives of the new system was to shorten the average length of stay inthe hospital for each Medicare patient (although average length of stay hadalready been dropping for several years). Opponents of the new system havecontendedthatpatientswerebeing discharged\"quickerandsicker,\"transferred to their own homes or to nursing homes at a stage in theirrecovery when they still required hospital-level care. Because of a lack ofsatisfactory measures of medical care outcomes for large populations, evidenceon this issue remains largely anecdotal. Still, the possibility that there hasbeen a deterioration in quality of care for at least some Medicare patients \"Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.

At the same time, the Administration and the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (the independent commission that reviews PPS) have argued that hospitals are still not operating at peak efficiency and that further payment restraint is needed to provide continued incentives for cost reduction.*This debate illustrates one potential dilemma in the strategy of achieving savings by relying on the political process to limit the financial resources available to providers.On the one hand, legislators driven by budgetary concerns may continue to ratchet down spending limits until they have clear evidence that quality has been seriously affected.On the other hand, provider or constituent pressure may lead them to relax those limits before the providers have done everything possible to improve their efficiency. Because no one knows the ideal amount to spend on medical care, some people say that this processcan never achieve equilibrium and that cost control efforts should instead depend on the process through which other sectors of the economy achieve *correct\" spending levels:the free market. Proposals for encouraging competition in health care represent the last of the strategies to be reviewed in this report. COMPETITIONThe idea of reducing healthcare costs by promoting competition in the health care marketplacewas first advanced in the 1970s. Some analysts, arguing that such initiativesas rate regulation, health planning, and utilization review had been compromised by political interference, contended that the free market was better equipped to control costs than Government was. By the early 1980s, this view had wide currency and had become the official policy of the Reagan Administration.Since then, there has beena continuing debate between advocates of competition and those who favored further regulatory interventions by Government.The debate has been complicated by a lack of agreement over what \"competition\" consists of. What is the health care market? Who are the purchasers, and what are they buying?In a simple market, hospitals and physicians would compete directly for the individual consumer's dollar. The consumer would pick the best values just as he or she does when buying any other commodity. As was suggested *U.S.Prospective Payment Assessment Commission.Report and Recommendations to the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Washington, U.S. Govt. Print. Oft, Mar. 1989; For a recent review of hospital cost responsesto PPS, see Sheingold, Steven H. The First Three Years of PPS:Impact on Medicare Costs.Health Affairs, v. 8, no. 3, fall 1989.p. 191-204. 341 338 CRS-21 in the discussion of cost-sharing, it is not clear that consumers are capable ofmaking such evaluations; moreover, many purchasing decisions are made byphysicians on their patients' behalf, rather than directly by consumers.Finally, because few people can afford the costa of care for a major illness,most of the consumer's dollar is spent on health insurance, not on medicalcare itself. As was suggested earlier, this is true even when the insuranceplan imposes cost-sharing requirements on enrollees, because most health carecosts are incurred by a relatively small number of high-cost cases. For thisreason, most proponents of competition are really talking about pricecompetition among insurers, and only indirectly among providers.If the insurer is--as traditional health insurance plans werea passivepayer for services obtained by policyholders, there is little room for seriousprice competition. The only element of cost that the insurer can control is itsown administrative cost.Competition, if any, may turn on such non-pricefactors as reputation or the insurer's abilityto screen out high-riskapplicants.'Competition among insurers can result in real cost savings only if theinsurers have some influence on the costs of health care itself. In this model,insurers compete to offer lower prices by acting aa prudent purchasers,proxies for the rational consumer. The insurers are selling a new product, nolonger simply insurance, but 'Insured health care.\" To some extent, this newinsurance market has already arrived. As was suggested earlier, mostinsurance plans, both public and private, have adopted some utilizationcontrol measures. Very few insurers are still passive bill-payers.Once all insurers have adopted these basic cost control measures, furthercompetition would presumably require more aggressive interventions byinsurers in the health care system. Proponents of competition contemplate amarketplace in which insurers develop structured delivery systems, with thehighest profits going to those whose networks are most efficient. Theprototype for these systems is the }IMO. More recently, some insurers havebeen experimenting with hybrid programs, such as ''point-of-service plans,\"that are less structured and provide somewhat greater flexibility to enrollees. \"Alain Enthoven has summarized the alternatives to price competition:\"(Sielection of preferred risks, market segmentation, product differentiationthat raises the costs of comparing products, discontinuity in coverage, refusalto insure certainindividuals or exclusion of coverage for treatment ofpreexisting mediccl conditions, biased information regarding coverage andquality, and erection of entry barriers (thatis,to new competitorsrEnthoven, Alain C. Managed Competition of Alternative Delivery Systems.Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, v. 13, no. 2, p. 305-321. 342 339 CRS-22 Health Maintenance OrganizationsA health maintenance organization (HMO) is a form of health insurer;like any other insurer, it accepts financial responsibility for a defined set ofhealth care benefits in return for a fixed monthly per capita premium.Unlike other insurers, HMOs directly provide or arrange for health careservices, through affiliated physicians, hospitals, and other providers. The enrollees covered by the HMO agree to obtain all services, except emergencyand out-of-area care, from or with the authorization of the HMO or itsaffiliated providers. The HMO has no liability to pay for unauthorized non-urgent care obtained outside the organization. Ordinarily, the enrollee's pointof entry .into the system is through a single primary care provider, whofunctions as a 'gatekeeper; determining when a patient may see a specialistor be admitted to the hospital. The HMO exerts further administrative controls on use of services through authorization mechanisms and/ortreatment protocols. HMOs also use a variety of other cost-saving techniques,such as negotiated discounts with providers and payment mechanisms thatplace individual providers at risk for the costs of the services they furnish ororder.The particular cost-saving techniques adopted by HMOs and other'managed care plans are not fundamentally different from the regulatoryapproaches described in the preceding sections. An HMO imposes externalutilization review on its participating providers and may develop practiceguidelines or protocols.Staff or group practice model HMOs (those thatemploy physicians on a full-time basis) impose supply constraints, limitingavailable resources to those needed by their membership. Individual practiceassociations (IPAs, whose physicians practice in their own offices and see amix of HMO and non-HMO patients) use payment methods that createfinancial incentives to control utilization, such as capitation or expendituretargets.One additional cost-saving approach that was once unique to HMOs is\"gatekeeping.\"Under a gatekeeping approach, a patient receives all non-emergency care from, or with the authorization of, a single primary careprovider.The provider thus functions as a \"gatekeeper,' preventing theenrollee from independently accessing specialists or other services andpresumably managing the overall care of the patient. The extent to whichgatekeeping produces savings over and above those provided by the othercost-saving techniques adopted by HMOs is uncertain. The results of oneexperiment, the SAFECO health plan operated by United HealthCare in theearly 1980s, suggest that gatekeeping alone has little effect on overall cost.While primary care providers reduced the number of referrals to specialists,they were unable to control the behavior of the specialists once a referral hadoccurred.There was no meaningful reduction in hospital admissions, 70 343 340 CRS-23 percent of which were controlled by the specialists.\" Greater success halbeen reported by some State Medicaid programs, which have established\"primary care cue management\" programs for segments of their coveredpopulations. Gatekeeping reduced such inappropriate behaviors as the use ofemergency rooms for primary care. However, the utilization patternsaddressed by these programs may be characteristic of Medicaid beneficiariesin the inner city and not of other groups; it is not clear that equivalentsavings could be achieved with a general population. There is some evidencethat most patients' care isalready 'managed' by their primary carephysicians, at lesat to the extent that it is managed under formal gatekeepingarrangements.\u00b0Aside from the uncertain effects of gatekeeping, managed care depends onthe same kinds of interventions in medical care practice, supply, and financingthat might otherwise be attempted on a regulatory basis. The difference isthat, instead of relying on the political process to make decisions about theallocation of health care resources, managed care privatizes these decisions.The choice among alternative cost control methodsand the stringency withwhich these methods will be applied--will be made by the free market. Thefundamental contention of proponents of the competitive approach is thatthe market can impose discipline on the health care system that cannot beimposed through external regulation.This contention rests on two key assumptions: first, that buyers will, allother things being equal, select the most cost-effective plan; second, thatmanaged care offers greater cost-saving potential than the various regulatorycontrols described earlier.One critical factor has made it difficult to generalize about the efficacyof HMOs as a cost-saving approach: the problem of \"biased selection\" insystems that allow a choice between a conventional health insurance plan andan HMO. Numerous studies of such \"dual choice\" employer group plans haveshown that the members of the group choosing the HMO option used fewerhealthservicesbeforetheir enrollment than persons who chose anconventional plan.Similar patterns have been observed in Medicare HMO 'Moore, Stephen, Diane Martin, and William Richardson.

Studies using self-reported condition and similar limited measuresof health status have found no difference between HMO and indemnityenrollees. It may be, then, that HMO enrollees are simply less prone to seekhealth service*, regardless of their condition.\"In groups that have no HMO option but do offer a choice between high-and low-option plans the common *election pattern is for the higher users ofservices to choose the more comprehensive plan.\" In most group healthprograms offering a choice between HMOs and conventional plans, the HMOoptions offer more comprehensive coverage, with less enrollee cost-sharing,than even a high-option conventional plan. That higher users of services stillprefer the conventional plan suggests that non-financial aspects of HMOsaffectthe decision, such aslimited choice of providers, bureaucratic constraints on treatment, or waiting time for non-urgent care. There is stronger evidence of biased selection for staff and group model HMOs, themost restrictive, than for 1PAs, which are less likely to disrupt enrollees'traditional ways of obtaining medical care.Possible solutions to the problem of selection bias will be discussedfurther below. One immediate consequence, however, is that the differencesbetween the populations in HMOs and conventional plane have made itdifficult to determine whether HMOs are actually more efficient than otherinsurers.Only one major study has corrected adequately for this problem.In a second component of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HEE)citedearlier,enrollees were randomly assigned to the Group HealthCooperative of Puget Sound and an equally comprehensive conventional plan;neither plan required cost-sharing. This arrangement allowed comparisons ofefficiency with identical benefits and pop. lions with comparable healthneeds. The results strongly confirmed the cost-saving potential of the HMO.The HMO enrollees had 40 percent fewer hospital admissions; their use ofambulatory services was about the same as that of the conventional enrollees.Overall, costs for the HMO group were estimated to be 28 percent lower than \"For a review of the evidence, see U.S. General Accounting Office.Medicare:Increase in HMO Reimbursement Would Eliminate PotentialSavings.

First, the study wu conducted in the late 1970s;the comparison plan was the passive bill-payer prevalent in the insuranceindustry in that period, with no utilization control mechanisms. The morerecent adoption by conventional plans of some of the cost-control measuresonce associated only with HMOs may mean that the difference in efficiencybetween the two types of plan has narrowed.Second, the HMO used in the Health Insurance Experiment was a highlystructured group-practice plan with many years of operating experience.Much of the growth in the industry in recent years has involved a differenttype of HMO, the individual practice association (IPA), which contracts withindependent physicians who see a mix of HMO enrollees and other kinds ofpatients.There is evidence that these more loosely structured HMOs havenot achieved savings comparable to those observed in the HIE.\" Physiciansmay not modify their styles of practice in treating HMO enrollees if thoseenrollees constitute only a small share of their practice. In addition, somepeople believe that HMOs cannot impose cost-consciousness on practitionerswho have not \"signed on\" to the concept of more efficient and less resource-intensive practice. Because so little is still known about the relative efficacyof different medical practices, external utilization controls may not be able tooverride individual physicians' judgment in many cases. The greater successof the \"closed panel\" plan, whose physicians treat HMO enrollees exclusively,has been attributed by some observers to the possibility that these plansattract physicians who are temperamentally more prone to conservativemedical practice.Because closed panel plans maintain their own medical facilities, theyrequire greater start-up funding than IPAs. Federal funds were available todevelop such plans in the 1970s, but new plane must now rely on private \"Manning, Willard G., et al.

Investors have favored IPAs, not only because they require less capital, but also because the wider selection of physicians makes them more attractive to consumers. This attraction may, however, be purchased at the price of reduced efficiency.Finally, while some types of HMOs or similar organizations may be able to reduce costs relative to conventional plans, it is not clear that they have so far reduced growth in health care costa. Data from 1961 through 1981 suggest that HMOs may instead achieve a one-time saving, after which costs rise at the same rate as those for other insurance programs. One explanation that has been offered is that providers in HMOs are as likely as other providers to use new medical technologies!' More recent data suggest that HMO premium increases have continued to resemble thoee of conventional insurance plans. The average HMO premium increase during 1988 was 17.2 percent, very close to the 19 percent increase for all employer coverage cited at the beginning of this report.\"That HMO cost increase* have paralleled those of other insurers does not necessarily mean that HMOs have reached the limit of their cost-saving potential. Because competition among health insurers was relatively limited until recent years, many HMOs may not have faced the market pressures that could induce them to achieve greater savings. The next section reviews proposals to strengthen competition.Competition and Consumer ChoiceThe competitive strategy depends on the willingness of consumers to choose the most cost-effective plans. As was suggested earlier, the consumers most likely to incur high costs may be least likely to choose the most efficient option. The problem of biased selection might persist even if conventional insurance plans were to disappear and consumers were able to choose only among managed care options. (Some industry analysts believe this will occur in the near future, chiefly because employers will refuse to offer conventional plans.)It is posaible that the most costly patients, given a choice among competing managed care plans, would choose the plan that was least restrictive and potentially least able to achieve cost savings.The most efficient plans might continue to enroll the healthiest patients, for whom only limited savings are possible. \"Newhouse, Joseph P., et al. Are Fee-for-Service Costs Increasing Faster Than HMO Costa? Medical Care, v. 23, no. 8, Aug. 1985. p. 960-66.nnterStudy. The Bottom Line: HMO Premiums and Profitability, 1988- 1989.Excelsior, Minn., 1989. Staff and group model HMOs generally had lower increases, possibly confirming their greater efficiency. However, these HMOs also tend to be older than IPAs; age of the HMO was also a determinant of the rate of increase.347 344 CRS-27 Some people believe that biased selection is largely attributable to thefact that consumers are economically sheltered from the cost of their choiceof plan, because most of the premium is paid by the employer. Variousschemes have been advanced to make the employee more cost-conscious. Forexample, the employer's contribution mieit be tied to the cost of the leastexpensive offering, with the employee bearing the full cost of the differencebetween that plan and other more expensive optiona.However, selection bias can occur even when the choice of the moreexpensive plan has real financial consequences for the enrollee. Under theFederal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the monthly employeeshare of premium costs in 1990 ranges from $20.54 in the leut expensivehigh-option HMO to $234.07 in the costly high-option conventional plan,a difference of $213.53 per month.\" Under one possible fixed contributionscheme, the Federal share of both plans would be set equal to the full cost ofthe HMO ($82.16); the employee share would then be zero for the HMO and$265.29 for the conventional plan. If some Federal employees or annuitantsare already willing to pay 11 times as much as others in order to obtain theconventional plan, it is not clear that even this change would cause all ofthem to shift to the HMO.For at least some subset of enrollees, thepreference for unrestricted coverage is apparently sufficient to override evenstrong financial incentives.One possible solution to the problem of enrollee self-selection is toabandon multiple choices and oblige all members of a covered group to entera single plan, one selected by the employer or other buyer from amongcompeting plans. Assuming that employers disregarded their own personalplan preferences and chose the least costly option, this approach wouldtheoretically lead to competition among plans on the basis of efficiency.However, both employers and HMOs have been hesitant to enter intoarrangements under which enrollees are unwillingly locked into a highlyrestrictive plan. For this reason, there have evolved arrangements even lessrestrictive than IPAs, known as open-ended or point-of-service plans.The predecessor of these plans is the preferred provider organization(PPO). PPOs negotiate discounted rates with certain providers. Enrolleesare given a financial incentive, in the form of reduced deductible orcoinsurance requirements, to obtain care from providers participating in thePPO network. However, payment will be made under the plan for servicesfurnished by any provider.PPOs thus differ from HMOs, which denypayment altogether for unauthorized non-emergent care provided by providersoutside the HMO network.While some PPOs have adopted managed caretechniques, such as the use of gatekeepers, most of the savings from a PPO 'The conventional plan is national, while HMOs are offered only inspecific locations.The comparison presented here applies only in one area(Tampa, Florida) and represents the extreme of variation in the FEHBPsystem. 348' 345 CRS-28 are expected to result from encouraging enrollees to use the participating providers.The newer, open-ended plans are hybrids, combining some features of HMOs and PPOs.Typically, the plan operates a structured health care system comparable to that of an IPA-model HMO. Enrollees are expected to access the system through a primary care gatekeeper and obtain services from other network providers upon referral by the gatekeeper. Like an HMO, the plan also imposes external utilization controls and negotiates price discounts with providers. As in a PPO, enrollees are free to use non-network providers for covered services, but must pay higher cost-sharing amounts if they choose to do so.Enrollees are also subject to higher cost-sharing if they use specialists within the network without the authorization of the gatekeeper.Open-ended plans have been adopted by some employers as the single plan available to their workers, replacing systems in which the workers had a choice between conventional and HMO options. Their attraction has been that they overcome the possible selection bias in dual choice systems by enrolling all employees in an HMO-like program. At the same time, they can reduce the employee resistance that would probably greet a proposal for universal HMO enrollment, because they offer employees the safety valve of being able to choose non-plan providers.Officials of some major insurers that have experimented with open-ended plans in multiple markets report that the plans appear to be reducing the rate of health care cost increases, relative to the increases for their conventional offerings in the same markets.\" Because these plans began operations only very recently, the data required for an objective evaluation are not yet available.Even PPOs, which have existed for a decade, have never been the subject of a controlled study. Some preliminary findings, however, suggest that the safety valve that makes PPOs attractive is potentially a serious weakness, one which may carry over to the newer hybrid plans.One recent study of a PPO found that enrollees used the PPO's providers for preventive care and minor illnesses, but went outside the network about half the time forspecialtycare,major surgery, and hospitalization without surgery.\" One study found a similar pattern among PPO enrollees who were actually employees of one of the providers in the \"Personal communication with officials of Prudential and CIGNA.\"Wouters, Annemarie, and James Hester. Patient Choice of Providers in a Preferred Provider Organization. Medical Care, v. 26, no. 3, Mar. 1988. p. 240-255.The results may not be fully representative, because the PPO studied was somewhat skewed towards primary care providers. 349 346 CRS-29 PPO network!'While these findings are not definitive, they suggest adilemma that may be common to both PPOs and the newer types of managedcare plans.If the price for going out of plan is not punitive, enrollees mayobtain much of their care outside the network; if the price is set high enoughto deter outside utilization, the plan may lose its relative attractiveness.Both solutions to the biased selection problem, higher premiums for thenon-HMO plan or higher cost-sharing for using non-HMO providers, maythen face the same potential barrier: the highest-risk enrollees, those forwhom the greatest potential savings presumably exist, may be willing to paymuch more out-of-pocket to retain free choice of providers and avoidbureaucratic restrictions. While the problem might be overcome by makingthe cost of unrestricted health care prohibitive, this solution may beforeclosed by the potential strain on labor relations (or, in the case of publicprograms, political resistance).One other solution that has been proposed is to go to the roots ofconsumer resistance to managed care, the concern about quality. Someanalysts argue that, because consumers have little information about therelative quality of different medical care providers, they must rely on \"signal?of quality sent out by various providers, such as the use of elaboratetechnology or aggressive medical treatment styles. If the persons with thehighest expectation of requiring medical services will accept financial sacrificesto avoid managed care programs, this may be because they cannot evaluatethe care offered by such programs, and wish to remain free to seek out theproviders who more actively signal quality. This preference might beovercome if consumers had reliable data on the actual quality of the carefurnished by different providers or provider systems such as HMOs.This view has led to such proposals as the \"buy right\" plan advanced byWalter McClure of the Center for Policy Studies in Minnesota. Under thisplan, a community would collect and make available to consumers uniformdata on patient outcomes from all providers. Consumers would then be in aposition to determine whether the higher cost providers were actuallyfurnishing superior care and could thus make rational purchasing decisions.The proposal assumes that the community can agree on objective measures ofquality.Past efforts to develop uniform bases of comparison have beencontroversial. For example, the annual release by the Health Care FinancingAdministration of mortality data for Medicare beneficiaries in hospitals hasbeen criticized on the grounds that numerous factors other than relative ehr, Paula, et al.Use of a Preferred Provider by Employees of thePreferred Provider.

Highly specializedfacilities may be treating the most seriously ill patients; facilities serving alow-income population may find that more of their patients have delayedmedical treatment beyond the point at which they could be helped. Fullimplementation of the 'buy right' strategy might have to wait until researchcan provide acceptable standardized outcome measures.Assuming that those measures can be developed, how would competitionthen work? Consumers would be fully informed about the relative price andquality of competing health plans, and would thus be equipped to makemedical care purchasing decisions in the same way that they decide aboutother purchases.Proponents of competition argue that the power of themarket would then compel all providers to make steady improvements in bothquality and efficiency. However, if the health care market could be inducedto evolve in the same way as other markets, it is not necessarily the case thatthe end product would be a single class of providers uniformly striving toachieve the same goals. The health care market could instead be segmentedin the way that the markets for other goods and services are; there might beeconomy and luxury health plans just as there are economy and luxuryautomobiles. Improving the information available to health care consumersmight mean only that buyers would be better able to distinguish between thetwo, not that the distinction would cease to exist. Whether Americans are prepared to accept the same price/quality tradeoffs in buying medical carethat they do in buying other products is an open question. 35'64-300 09312 348 1:13930011Health Care Refornu Managed Competition gEMMARICongress is considering a range ofproposals to control growth in healthspending. One receiving wide attention ismanaged competition, under which consum-ers would choose from among competinghealth plans and would be given financialincentives to select the most coet-effective.Plans using this approach have been intro-duced in Congress by the House Conserva-tive Democratic Forum and by SenatorBingamsn, and President-elect Clinton hasindicated that managed competition willplay a part in his health reform package.Proponents of competition contendthat the favorable tax treatment of healthbenefits and other factors have encouragedworkers to choose inefficient health plans.They would change financial incentives tomake consumers more prudent purchasers.To insure that purchasers could assess theprice and quality of different plans, anintermediary, the health insurance purchas-ing cooperative (111PC), would be estab-lished between the consumer and the com-peting health plans. By selecting qualifiedplans, standardizing benefits, and providingquality information, the HIPC would 'man-age the market. In most propoaals, 111PCparticipation would be required for allpurchasers in an area or for defined sub-groups (such as small employers and/orindividuals buying coverage on their own).Several different insurers would arrangewith the HTPC to offer health benefit plans.Each individual or family participating inthe HIPC would select from among thedifferent plans offered. In order to facili-tate consumer choice, the HIPC wouldcollect and disseminate information on thequality and costs of the participating plans.01.01143 Through tax system changes, familieswould be given an incentive to choose theleast costly plan offered through the HIPCand meeting specified benefit and qualitystandards. The expectation is that manypeople will opt for \"managed care plans,such as health maintenance organizations,which arrange for covered services throughaffiliated provider networks and seek toprovide care with maximum efficiency.Perhaps the key issue in evaluatingmanaged competitionisitsabilitytoachieve savings.There is evidence thattightly structured HMOs can cut costs overthe short term, although they do not ap-pear to reduce long-term spending growth.Competition proponents say that marketpressurewillproduce greater savings.However, it is not certain that most con-sumers would select highly restrictive HMOplans (nor would such plans be availableimmediately in many areas). Some propos-als would have a regulatory back-up avail-able (such as limits on premium increases)if competition failed to achieve savings.Some people raise concern, that com-petitive pressure could lead plans to denynecessary services, or that lower-incomepeople could be forced into a basic plan,while others could buy coverage offeringhigher quality care. Finally, limits on taxbenefits are central to the concept of givingconsumers incentives to be prudent pur-chasers. For workers now receiving morecostly health benefits, however, these limitswould mean a tax increase or a reduction inbenefits.Debate over this component islikely to be a mejor issue in considerationof the competitive approach.

Congressional Research Service The Library of Congress 352 349 IB93008 01-0643 Most Recent planwould iuilude maragediompetition approach, along with some form of spending BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISCongress I. considering a wide range of proposals to control the growth in healthcare spending. Many focus on particular factors thought to contribute to rising costs;for example, there are numerous plans for administrative simplification or for reformingthe malpractice liability system. Other proposals, however, call for a more fundamentalrestructuring of the way medical care is paid for. One option now receivingconsiderable attention is managed competition, under which consumers would choosefrom among a variety of competing health plans and would be given financial incentivesto select the most cost-effective.President-elect Clinton has indicated that managed competition will play a partin his health care reform proposal; the Bush Administration's proposal also includedelements of this approach. A number of bills incorporating the concept were introducedin the 102nd Congress, including H.R. 5936 (Cooper)/S. 3299 (Boren), the HouseConservative Democratic Forum proposal, and S. 3300 (Bingaman). Widely discussedmanaged competition proposals have also been advanced by a private ad-hocorganization known as the Jackson Hole Group and by California InsuranceCommissioner John Garamendi.The managed competition option is commonly discussed in the context of proposalsto provide or assure access to universal health coverage. Managed competition schemeshave been incorporated in bills providing for universal public coverage, for mandatedemployer coverage, or for individual purchase of private insurance with public subsidies.Thus, there is no necessary connection between the selection of this cost containmentapproach and the preferred approach to guaranteeing access. It is important, then, todistinguish between the access/financing component of a proposal how people will get basic coverage and how the coverage will be paid for and the cost containment component.This brief will focus chiefly on managed competition as it might beimplemented in the current health system, with its mix of public coverage and privatecoverage paid for by employers and individuals. The summaries of specific proposalswilldescribe how managed competition has been combined with differentaccess/financing approaches.Evolution of the ConceptManaged competition proposals begin with the premise that the market for healthservices is not truly competitive and that strengthening market competition would leadto greater efficiency and quality. Because most services are covered by insurance,consumers have no reason to consider the costs or efficacy of the care they obtain. Inaddition, consumers are largely sheltered from the costa of insurance itself. Most people CRS-1 BEST COPY AVAILABLE353 350 IB93008 01-06-93 are covered through employment, and the employer's contribution to hlalth benefitplans is excluded from workers' income for tax purposes.Some economists have long argued that the key to controlling health care costs isto limit or eliminate the favorable tax treatment of health benefits, thus encouratingworkers to choose less costly insurance. In the classic view, represented by suchproposals as the Heritage Foundation plan, consumers would shift to plans with higherdeductible and coinsurance payments. As they began to pay more of their medical billsdirectly, theymould become more prudent purchasers of services, avoiding overpricedor ineffective care. (For a description of the Heritage Foundation plan and other tax-based propooals, see Health Care Refonn: Tax System Approaches, CRS Iseue Brief93002.) One objection to this approach has always been that consumers were notactually in a position to act as prudent purchssers. They cannot evaluate whether agiven lab test or operation is appropriate and so defer to the judgment of theirphysician. For many patients, greater cost-sharing might merely shift costs from theinsurer to the consumer without reducing overall vending. In addition, most medicalcare is consumed by a small number of individuals with catastrophic costs. Assumingthat any insurance plan would still have mome limit on individuals' out-of-pocketspending, increased front-end deductible and coinsurance costs might have no effect onthis spending.Early competition proposals, in the 1970s, sought to address these problems byshifting the focus from greater consumer cost-sharing to greater incentives for efficiencyon the part of insurance plans. Workers would still be encouraged to buy less costlycoverage by reducing tax-favored employer payments. But the least costly coveragewould be the plan that managed care most effectively, not the plan with the highestcost-sharing. The prototype for this approach was the health maintenance organization(HMO).An HMO is a form of health insurer. Like other insurers, it accepts financialresponsibility for a defined set of health care benefits in return for a fixed monthly percapita premium paid by or on behalf of each enrolled member. Unlike other insurers,liMOs directly provide or arrange for health care services, through affiliated physicians,hospitals, and other providers, instead of simply paying bills. The enrollees covered bythe HMO agree to obtain all services, except emergency and out-of-area care, from orwith the authorization of the HMO or its affiliated providers. An HMO attempts toreduce costa by managing enrollees' use of services. It may reduce unnecessaryhospitalizations, diagnostic tests, or specialty referrals, either through programs toreview the use of services or by giving participating physicians a financial stake in thecost of the services they order. It may also select low-cost providers of services ornegotiate diacounted rates from providers.Federal start-up assistance for HMOs in the 1970s, along with the belief of manyemployers that HMOs could reduce their health benefit costs, led to rapid growth in theindustry. In 1970, there were 26 HMOs or comparable prepaid plans in the UnitedStates, with a total enrollment of 2.9 million. By 1990, according to the Group HealthAssociation of America (GHAA), there were 569 HMOs reporting a total enrollment of36.5 million.Beginning in the early 1980s, other types of \"managed care\" plans have developed.These include preferred provider organizationi 'open-ended\" or ''point-of-service HMOs. As in traditional HMOs, these arrangements provide covered servicesthrough provider networks. Enrollees are given financial incentives to use services CRS-2 354 351 1393008 01-06-93 within the plan's provider network, but still receive some coverage even if they decideto obtain care from outside providers. These arrangements may be more attractive toconsumers who wish to retain some freedom of choice of providers, and they havegrown even faster than HMOs in recent years. According to the Health InsuranceArsociation of America (HIAA), PPOs and point-of-service plans accounted for 18% ofenrollees in employer group health plans in 1990, compared to 20% in HMOs. Mostindemnity or 'fee-for-service' plans, which allow unlimited choice of providers, have alsoadopted at least some techniques associated with managed care, such as pre-admissionapproval of elective hospital stays. Only 5% of employees in 1990 were still in planswith no utilization management. (Although soms insurers speak of conventional planswith some utilization management as \"managed care,' the phrase is more commonlylimited to plans with some form of affiliated provider network.)The dramatic increase in the use of managed care has not been accompanied byany apparent slowdown in the growth of national health spending. Managedcompetition advocates contend that this problem reflects the continuing ineffectivenessof the market. Because the tax law still favors more costly coverage, consumers havea limited incentive to choose a more efficient plan. The confusing variety of availablebenefit packages makes price comparison difficult, and consumers lack reliableinformation on the quality of different plans. In addition, many insurers may compete,not on the basis of efficiency, but on the basis of their ability to screen out high-riskapplicants and enroll low-cost patients.Another key problem has been 'biased selection.\" Many persons are resistant tothe restrictions inherent in HMOs; they want to choose their own doctor. As a result,younger and healthier people may tend to choose HMOs, while the older and sickerones stay with conventional indemnity coverage and continue to incur high costs. Thismeans, not only that costly patients fail to receive managed care, but also that HMOsmay be under less pressure to operate efficiently than they would be if they served afully representative population.The current managed competition proposals seek to address many of the structuralproblems of the market by introducing an intermediary, often termed a healthinsurance purchasing corporation (HIPC), between the consumer and thecompeting health plane. By selecting qualified plans, standardizing benefits, andproviding quality information, the HIPC would manage the market, ensuring consumersa real choice among plans competing on the basis of quality and efficiency. (Note thatthe phrase 'managed competition' refers to this feature of the proposals, managing orregulating the market, rather than to the use of 'managed care\" plans.)Despite this refinement in competition proposals, the basic mechanism forpromoting competition is unchanged: consumers would be required (through tax systemchanges or other means) to bear the entire cost of choosing any but the least costlyhealth plan meeting minimum standards. From the perspective of many workers, thismeans taking a benefit they now perceive as free access to employer-paid indemnitycoverage -- and charging them for it. Debate over this key component is likely to be amajor issue in congressional consideration of the competitive approach.Basic ModelPurchasers of health insurance coverage, whether employers or individuals, wouldjoin together in a WC. The HIPC could be organized by the purchasers themselves CRS-3 355 352 11393008 01-06-93 in a voluntary association. However, mott proposals would require HIPC participationfor all purchasers in the HIPC's geographic area or for defined subgroups (such as small employers and/or individuals buying coverage on their own). Several different entities(insurers or insurer/provider networks) would arrange with the HIPC to offer healthbenefit plans to HIM participants. The HIPC might enter into agreements with any insurer that met minimum quality and fmancial standards, or it might be given thepower to limit the number of participating insurers.The HIPC (or a State or national board) would defme a basic plan, the minimumscope of benefits that must be provided by all participating innirers. Insurers mightbe allowed to offer plans with benefits beyond the minimum, such as prescription drug coverage or a reduced deductible. Or they might all be required to offer the same plan, with plans differing only in coverage of non-essential 'amenities; such as payment for a private room in a hospital. Plans would then differ chiefly in their arrangementswith providers. Some would be HMOs, others would be PPOs or other less restrictive managed care plans, and there might still be an indemnity option allowing unrestrictedchoice of providers.Each individual or family participating in the IHPC would select from among the different plans offered. This individual selection would occur even if the consumer was part of an employer group and the employer paid for coverage; the individual, not theemployer, would chooee the plan. If the individual changed jobs, moving from one employer to another in the aame HIPC, the individual could remain enrolled in the same plan. An individual could change plane at given intervals, such as once a year.Each plan would agree to accept every individual who selected it; no one could be excluded on medical or other grounds, nor could rates vary on the basis of health status or similar characteristics. Individuals would enroll in their selected plan through theHIPC; in most proposals, a plan could not market directly to individuals. (This feature is intended to prevent plans from screening out high-risk applicants and to reduce administrative coats.) In order to facilitate consumer choice among plans, the HIPC would collect and dimeminate comparative information on the quality and costs of the participating plans. Ability to furnish this data would be a key factor in a plan's eligibility for HIPC participation.Most proposals also attempt to address the problem of biased selection through some form of risk adjustment. The HIPC would reduce premium payments for plansfound to have lower-risk populations and increase payments for plans with higher-risk enrollees. The mechanisms for doing so are discusred below.Through bidding or some other process, the HIPC would establish the lowest premium rate offered by any participating insurer for a plan providing at least the minimum required benefits. This would then become the base price for HIPC coverage. Employers would be discouraged (through changes in the tax code) or forbidden to contribute more than this amount towards employees' coverage. If individuals were eligble for some form of public subsidy, whether direct or in the form of tax credits or deductions, the maximum subsidy would be set equal to the base price. Any consumer could join the least costly plan for the base price. If the consumer wished to join a more expensive plan, he or she would pay the entire difference between that plan'spremium and the base price, without any employer or public assistance. All consumers would thus be givenfinancial incentive to select a less costly plan. Those with very low incomes might have no choice but to enroll in the minimum plan, although some CRS-4 353 1893008 01-06-93 proposals include mechanisms that would distribute low-income enrollees among severalplans.Implementation Issues and OptionsActual implementation of the managed competition concept raises numerousissues. The following is a summary of a few of them and is not meant to be exhaustive.HIPC. The Bush Administration proposal and some others have called forvoluntary HIPC formation, for example by organizations of small businesses. Theremight be multiple WPCs in a single area, and any purchaser could decide whether tobuy coverage through HII C or deal with an insurer directly. At least three concernshave been raised about this approach. First, there might be many small HMCo, noneof which had sufficient bargaining power to get the best prices from competing insurers.Second, no one would enter a HIPC who could obtain a better price outside the HIPC;HIPCs might attract only high-risk groups or individuals. Third, and in consequence,HIPCs would face the same pressures insurers do now, to screen out high riskapplicants and keep their prices low. (The best-known prototype voluntary H1PC,Cleveland's Council of Small Enterprises (COSE), excludes some high risk groups.)Thus many proposals instead call for a single Bin in a geographic area, such aspart of a State. (Determining the size of the area requires balancing the need forreasonably uniform costs against the need for a large enough HIPC to operateeffectively.)HIPC participation by at least some classes of purchasers would bemandatory. For example, businesses up to a certain size might be required to purchasecoverage through the area HIPC, while larger employers could buy coverage outside itor self insure (pay employees' claims directly instead of paying premiums to a insurer).Some argue that larger firms have the resources to do their own plan evaluation andbargaining without the HIPC. In addition, firms operating in multiple HIPC areaswould prefer to offer uniform benefits rather than deal through multiple HIPCs. Thereis a question whether firms not required to join the HIPC could be allowed do so voluntarily. Some would exclude them on the grounds that only firms with above-average coats would do so, thus driving up HIPC premiums and, in effect, compellingsmall firms to subsidize high risk larger firms.Accountable health plans. HIPC participation would be limited to what arefrequently termed accountable health plans (AHPs), those that meet certain minimumstandards. Some proposals would have a Federal board develop the standards andcertify eligible plans, while others would leave this function te the H1PC. ABPs wouldhave to demonstrate solvency arid comply with standards for non-discrimination inenrollment and rating. At least at the outset, AHPs would not have to be HMOs or other managed care plans, although managed competition proponents assume that thesetypes of plans are most likely to survive the preuures of the market. Instead, AlIPswould have to furnish information, specified by the Federal board or the HIPC, relatingto use and costs of services and outcomes of medical care. This information is centralto the HIPC's function of furnishing comparative cost/quality data to consumers. Thenature of this information has not been fully specified, and it is not clear that manyplans (whether HMO or indemnity) could currently furnish the detailed datacontemplated. Proponents of managed competition expect that data standards wouldbecome more stringent over time; ultimately smaller insurers would be unable to meetthem, leading to greater industry concentration. CRS-5 3 7 354 IB93008 01-06-93 A key issue is whether the HIPC must accept any plan meeting AHP standards,or whether it may exercise discretion and select a limited number of plans. Argumentsfor a limited number of plans include the potential for economies of scale, easiercomparisons for consumers, and perhaps allowing the HIPC to deal with quality issuesand other emerging problems more rapidly and informally than would be possible in asystem with more plans and a stricter regulatory structure. However, proposals thatmandate HIPC participation by some or all employers and perhaps by Medicaid beneficiaries and individual purchasers could mean that no insurer could operate inan area if it was not selected by the HIPC. Some people estimate that as many as 3,000separate entities now sell health insurance in the U.S. There is likely to beconsiderable resistance to giving HIPCs discretionary powers to put all but five or sixof these out of business. Instead HIPCs might be required to operate in a formal, quasi-governmental fashion, with market concentration occurring gradually ascompetitive preuures grew tighter.Defining benefits. Managed competition requires both the definition of a basicbenefit package and a decision about what sorts of benefits may be offered over andabove the basic package.Defining this package is an important issue, since the package would constitutenot only the minimum available for all participants but also the maximum for whichemployer contributions or public subsidies would be provided. A basic plan that wouldbe affordable for individuals or small employers could represent a significant reductionin benefits for employees of larger firms with generous benefit plans. On the otherhand, the scope of the basic plan would also determine the amount of new Federalrevenues available from limiting the tax exclusion for employer benefits; a package lessgenerous than current employee benefits would raise more money.In most proposals, the basic package would also constitute the 'free\" plan forcurrent Medicaid beneficiaries and new low-income populations receiving assistance inbuying coverage. Too restrictive a basic package could deprive the poor of access toneeded services; some proposals would include free supplemental benefits for personsbelow a given income threshold.Whatever the basic plan consists of, there is also the issue of what may be offeredover and above the basic plan (with any additional expenses to be borne by theconsumer). As noted earlier, some propoeals would require an AHP to sell the basicplan and nothing else, on the grounds that benefit variations make price comparisondifficult, and that some benefit packages could be designed by insurers to attract low-risk enrollees and deter high-risk ones. Under these propcsals, variation among planswould be limited to \"amenities. This term is ill-defined; amenities could conceivablyinclude, not just personal comfort items, but also greater access to medical technology,shorter waiting times for services, and higher quality care. The result could be theevolution of different levels of access and quality for different income groups. Thisissue is considered further below.Finally, there is the question of whether individuals purchasing basic coveragethrough the HIPC could separately purchase supplemental coverage, for example tomeet deductible and coinsurance requirements under the basic plan. While the competitive approach would not necessarily rule out individuals' buying additionalcoverage with their own after-tax dollars, persons with supplemental coverage mightuse more services under the basic plan than persons without this coverage (becausethey would not have the deterrent of cost-sharing). Price comparisons among basic 358CRS-6 355 1B93008 01-06-93 plans might be distorted if some plans' enrollees were obtaining care financed throughsupplemental coverage.Risk adjustment. A. noted earlier, most proposals call for some form of riskadjustment to correct for biased selection, including both self-selection (preference ofhigh-risk patients for certain plans) and \"skimming' (deliberate measures by plans toattract low-risk enrollees).The HIPC would collect premiums due to each plan(including employer, public, and/or individual contributions) and would then adjust theamount to reflect the actual level of risk represented by each plan's population. Thisis meant to ensure that plans compete on the basis of efficiency, rather than on theirability to attract low-coet enrollees.Risk adjurtment requires measures that can reliably predict the relative need forhealth services of the membership of different plans on the basis of readily collectibleinformation about member characteristics. The simplest meseures are demographiccharacterietics such as age and sex. There have also been experiments with the use ofother kinds of data, including a review of past diagnoses or services received andqueetionnaires on self-perceived health etatus. At an individual level, age and sex havebeen found to predict only 1-4% of differences inlealth utilization. Systems usingdiagnosis or service data do only somewhat better, predicting up to 8% of utilization;however, moet have been teeted on Medicare populations and might not function as wellfor younger populations with less chronic illness. Some proponents of managedcompetition contend that, if HIPC areas are large enough and there are only a fewAliPs in each HIPC, plan populations may be large enough that even relatively crudemeasures (such as age, sex, and a brief health questionnaire) would permit adequateplan comparison.Plan capacity. A central concept of managed competition is that every individualin the HIPC can choose the most efficient plan for the base price or can pay more fora less efficient plan. However, the plans that are hypothetically most efficient staffand group model HMOsalso have a limited short-term capacity to accept newmembers, because they must develop new facilities and hire additional personnel whentheir enrollment grows. This could mean that many HIPC participants would not infact have the option of joining the lowest cost plan. If, for example, the District ofColumbia Medicaid program bought coverage through the local HIPC and the low-bidding plan was one of the group model HMOs, there might be 100,000 beneficiariesseeking to join an HMO that could accept only 5,000 or 10,000, because all otheroptions would require out-of-pocket payment. This is an extreme case, but it is possiblethat there will be always be areas in which the lowest cost plan cannot accept everyonewho wishes to join it. Participants might then be allowed to join the next least costlyplan without additional out-of-pocket costs (snd so on until there were enough baseprice slots for everyone who wanted one). However, this solution would weaken pricecompetition and could limit potential savings until capacity problems could be solved.Imperfect competition. Many parts of the country still have no HMOs or othernetwork plans, and there are areas in which development of competing providernetworks may not be feasible (for example, rural town with a single physician). Someproposals define these \"areas of imperfect competition,\" thooe that may be temporarilyor permanently unable to eupport true competition among plans and whose populationsare likely to continue in traditional indemnity coverage. Over time, there might berelatively few euch areas. As of 1989, however, there were still 12 States in whichfewer than 5% of the insured population was in HMOs. Pending development ofcompeting plans, some proposals would use other cost controls in them area., such as CRS-7 359 356 1B93008 01-06-93 price or premium regulation. This solution, however, moves from a competitive to aregulatory approach, and raises the problem of deciding just when an area has sufficientcompetition to shift back from the regulatory to the market approach to cost control.Income tiering. Managed competition proponents argue that the power of themarket would compel all plans to make steady improvements in both quality andefficiency. However, if the health care market could be induced to evolve in the sameway as other markets, it is not necessarily the case that the end product would be asingle clam* of plans uniformly striving to achieve the same goals. The health caremarket might inirtead be segmented in the way that the markets for other goods andservices are: there might be economy and luxury health plans, with different levels ofaccess and quality, just as there are economy and luxury automobiles. Access to carevaries by income level in the current system; so long as everyone was assured basiccoverage of adequate quality, it might not be a concern that access disparities wouldcontinue in a competitive system. However, some proposals do seek to reduce thepossibility that there might develop low-income and high-income health plans.One proposal for limiting tiering is to require that every plan accept a specifiednumber of low-income persons at the base rate; this would require some system fordeciding who would be allowed into the higher-priced plan and who would be requiredto accept the free plan. An alternative, included in the Garamendi plan, is to place adollar or percentage limit on the amount by which any plan's premium could exceed thebase rate. This would limit the range of quality differences among plans.Major ProposalsJackson Hole Group. The Jackson Hole Group is an informal group of healthpolicy experts and other interested parties led by Paul Ellwood, Alain Enthoven, andLynn Etheredge; the group's health reform proposal was first issued in 1991. Underthe general oversight of a National Health Board, each State would designate one ormore HIPCs that would contract with Accountable Health Partnerships (AHPs). AIIPswould be provider or provider-insurer networks that were approved by the nationalboard and that (a) weed to provide a uniform benefit package approved by the boardto all firms or individuals and (b) provided outcome data specified by the board to allowcomparison of quality among AHPs.All employers would be required to contribute to the cost of health benefits forfull-time employees and pay a payroll tax on behalf of part-time employees. Firms withfewer than 100 employees would obtain coverage through the HIPC; larger firms coulddeal with AHPs on their own. The current exclusion of health benefits from employees'income would not apply to non-AHP plans or to any employer contributions in excessof the lowest price offered by an AHP through the area HIPC for the standard benefitpackage. Employees wishing a more coatly plan would pay the difference themselves.Part-time workers and others not obtaining coverage through their employer wouldobtain coverage through the IEEPC. The State would pay the premium for the lowest-cost plan on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries and would subsidize all or part of thepremiums for other low-income persons. Eventually Medicare would also purchasecoverage through H1PCs.Conservative Democratic Forum (CDF). The CDF plan, introduced in the102nd Congress as H.R. 5936 (Cooper), is conceptually similar to the Jackson Holeproposal, but differs in several key details. Employers would not be required to furnish 3)CRS-8 357 13193008 01-06-93 health coverage. Small employers (those with up to 1,000, or at State option up to10,000 employees) who chooe to offer coverage would have to purchame through theWPC. Employer contribution/. in excess of the lowest AHP price would not becometaxable income to the employs., but the employer would be aubject to 34% excise taxon excess contributions or ah,r contributions to a non-AHP plan. (Self-insured planscould continue to operate if tt.ey met AHP standards.) Basic plan costs would be fullydeductible for individuals.Medicaid would be phased out, with the acute carecomponent replaced by Federal premium and cost-sharing subsidies for low-incomepersons covered through HIPCs; States would be reaponsible for long-term care.Financing for low-income sc,beidies would include the excise tax on excess contributionsand elimination of the usirrent ceiling on wages subject to the Medicare payroll tax.Senator Bingaman. Senator Bingaman introduced three managed competitionbills in the 102nd Congress: S. 2675, S. 3165, and S. 3300. The last of these is the mostcomprehensive. It would create an HIPC/AHP structure comparable to that in theJackson Hole and CDF proposals. All US. residents would be eligible for coveragethrough State-established HIPC programs. Federal contributiona to the State programswould cover an average of 75% of the cost of coverage, with the remainder financedthrough individual premiums (subsidized for low-income persons) and optional employercontributions. The Federal grants would be.subject to budget limits based on projectednational average per capita costs for AHP coverage; States not able to provide coveragewithin the limits would have to supply additional resources. No employer could offera plan outside the IilPC; current self-insured plans could be offered through the HIPCbut apparently could not be restricted to the employer's own workers.Garamendl plan. In February 1992, California Insurance Commissioner JohnGaramendi proposed a universal coverage plan to be implemented at the State level.The California legislature approved legislation to plan for implementation of theproposal; this leeslation was vetoed by Governor Wilson. Under the Garamencli plan,the State would establish one HIPC for each geographic area; virtually all persons inthe State would obtain uniform coverage through the HIPC. Medicaid and perhapsMedicare would be incorporated in the system if Federal waivers could be secured. TheState would pay the premium for the lowest-priced plan on behalf of all residents, withthe costs to be funded through employer and employee payroll taxes. The State contribution could not exceed per capita revenues from the payroll tax; this would ineffect cap the premium for the low-price plan. Individuals choosing a higher-priced planwould pay the excess premium themselves. However, there would be at least two healthplans available for no additional premium, and there would be a limit on the amountby which any plan's premium could exceed the base price. (One novel feature of theplan, not directly related to managed competition, is \"24-hour coverage.' Health payments by aources other than health insurance, such as workers' compensation orautomobile insurance, would be folded into the health plan.)Fee-for-service default proposals. Some proposals would extend coverage toall US. residents through a universal public program (whether Federal or State), butwould give enrollees the option of selecting a managed care alternative. These includeH.R. 5514 (Dingell/Waxman) and S. 1446 (Kerrey) in the 102nd Congress. Coverage inthe standard fee-for-service plan would be free; managed care plans would also be free,but could offer more extensive benefits or reduced cost-sharing. This way of incorporating managed care is more or less the inverse of competitive proposals, inwhich benefits do not vary among plans and enrollees must pay extra for a fee-for-service plan. CRS-9 361. 358 IB93008 01-06-93Potential SavingsOverall savings. Managed competition in the sense of a regulated market withstrong consumer incentives to choose cost-effective plans and adequate information forevaluating those optionshas never been tried. Most large employers have offered twoor more choices of health plans for many years, and some (like the Federal EmployeesHealth Benefits Program, FEHBP) have offered a wide menu of fee-for-service, HMO,and other managed care plans, with significant differences in required employee costsharing depending on choice of plan. However, few of these multiple choice systemsmeet all the criteria specified by managed competition advocates as necessary forprogram success. Employer contributions are not necessarily fixed at the con of thelowest-priced plan, benefits under different choices are not uniform, reliable qualityinformation is not made available to enrollees, and no corrections are made for biasedselection.Medicare and many State Medicaid programs have also offered choicesbetween traditional coverage and HMO enrollment; however, beneficiaries have hadlittle or no financial incentive to accept the restrictions of ITMO coverage. (Some Stateshave mandated Medicaid HMO enrollment for some beneficiaries, instead of using thecompetitive approach.)In short, there is little experience to indicate whether the market restructuringproposed by supporters of managed competition would in fact induce most consumersvoluntarily to select HMOs or other hypothetically more cost-effective health plans, orwhether many would pay larger premiums to retain freedom of choice of providers.Assuming, however, that consumers would in fact select some form of managed careplan, would these choices result in overall cost savings? Evidence on the efficacy ofHMOs and other managed care plans has been reviewed at length elsewhere, mostrecently by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) (see For Additional Reading). Thefollowing is a brief summary of what is known.Staff and group model HMOs those that employ or contract with physicianswho exclusively treat HMO enrollees in BMO-operated facilities have been shown in the past to achieve savings of up to 25% relative to completelyuncontrolled indemnity plane. As noted earlier, most indemnity plans nowuse at least pre-adraission review of inpatient stays. For this and otherreasons, CBO estimates that staff and group model HMOs might now save15% compared to indemnity plans. Individual practice associations (IPAs),which contract with physicians who treat both HMO and non-HMO enrolleesin their own offices, achieve much smaller savings.Newer forms of managed care plans, including PPOs and point-of-serviceplans, have not been systematically evaluated. Some insurers and employershave reported savings from these plans. Their savings potential may vary,depending on whether they rely solely on negotiated provider discounts toreduce costa or also engage in active management of care. Discountarrangements can produce savings for a particular purchaser; however, if theproviders make up for the discounts by raising charges to other purchasers,there may be no system-wide savings. Plans that also include utilizationreview or similar measures may have a greater net effect.HMOs appear to achieve a one-time savings, relative to fee-for-service plans,but may not reduce long-term growth in health care costs. For example, overthe period 1970 to 1990 per member revenues of the Kaiser FoundationHealth Plans, the largest and one of the best-established HMOs, rose at an 362CRS-10 359 11393008 01-06-93 annual rate of 11.5%. National per capita spending for services equivalent tothoee offered by Raiser rose at an annual rate of 10.6%.Some people say that the apparent failure of HMOs to achieve ongoing savings inthe current market is the result of \"shadow pricing': because the HMOs do not face realcompetition they need only keep their prices just below those of the indemnity plans,and have not faced pressure to operate as efficiently as they could. An alternative viewis that over time HMOs face the same cost pressures as other insurers, in particularprovider and consumer demand for the adoption of new medical technologies.Federal budget savings. Whatever the potential of managed competition ormanaged care to control overall health spending, Congress is necesoarily concerned withany proposal's short- and long-term impact on the Federal budget, for two reasons.First, spending on Medicare and Medicaid is among the fastest growing components ofthe budget; there ix a consensus that control in this sector is central to any plan fordeficit reduction.Second, virtually every proposal for extending coverage to thecurrently uninsured population requires at least some new Federal spending, whetherin the form of direct subsidies or tax assistance for the private purchase of insuranceor in the form of publicly provided coverage. Many in Congress would prefer to fundthis new spending through offsetting savings in the health sector, rather than throughnew taxes, increased deficits, or diversion of resources from other government programs.Thus, while controlling costs for employers and individuals is an importantobjective, it may be unlikely that a plan can be adopted unless it also generatesmeasurable savings for the Federal Government. These savings can take two basicforms:Control of direct spending for Medi.:are, MedicaiA, and other health programs(such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program).Control of tax expenditures; that is, reducing the loss of Federal revenuesresulting from tax-favored health spending, chiefly on employee benefits.Most proposals would temporarily or permanently exempt Medicare beneficiariesfrom participation in a managed competition system, at least in part becausebeneficiaries, many of whom may have long-standing ties with particular physicians orother providers, are likely to resist a change to new health systems. On the other hand,most proposals would eliminate the acute care component of Medicaid, replacing it withsome form of subsidy to help current beneficiaries and other low-income persons buycoverage through a HIPC. Assuming that current beneficiaries would receive a fullpremium subsidy for the basic plan, along with waiver of any cost-sharingrequirements, it is not certain what net Federal savings would result. As suggestedearlier, capacity problems make it unlikely that all beneficiaries could be promptlyshifted to the most efficient managed care arrangements. Even if they could, savingsmight be limited, because Medicaid in most States is already paying providers less thantheir actual costs or usual charges. CB0 has estimated that enrollment of all Medicaidbeneficiaries in staff or group model HMOs would have saved a maximum of $3.5 billionin 1990 (or about $2 billion in Federal funds).For the most part, then, Federal savings would have to take the form of reducedtax expenditures. C130 projects a Federal 1992 revenue loss of $39.8 billion from theexclusion of employer-paid health insurance from employees' income. Aasuming thatthe least costly HIPC in every area would be 15% below typical current plan premiums - CRS-11 363 360 11393008 01-06-93 - the maximum CHO savings ettimate for staffigroup HMOs maximum potential newrevenues from taxing excess employer contributions would be about $6 billion. Theactual amount would be somewhat less, because most employers are not nowcontributing the full costs of employee coverage and becaume some excess contributionsmight be converted to other forms of nontaxable fringe benefits.Budget control option.. The maximum savings assumptions from managedcompetition emu= that the entire population would promptly join the most efficienttypes of managed care plans. As a practical matter, this is not an immediate option formost of the population. Staff/group model HMOs or similarly closely organized plansare unavailable in many areas and will take time (and capital) to develop; where theyexist, time will be needed to expand capacity. Because there is growing pressure toachieve some immediate control over health spending, some people who believe thatcompetition is ultimately the best approach are now endorsing regulatory spendinglimits as a sort of interim or fallback measure. Discussion of this option is just beginning, and few detailed proposals yet exist So far, at least three approaches havebeen suggested:Rate of increase limits for premiums. No insurer could raise premiumsbeyond a specified maximum annual increase.Absolute per capita premium limits. No insurer could charge more than aspecified maximum amount for a defined basic package of benefits.Budget targets. A desired rate of growth in national health spending wouldbe established as a benchmark. Only if managed competition failed to achievethe desired savings would the budget target be enforced (through premiumregulation or direct regulation of provider prices).The Garamendi plan (and any plan with a defined revenue source) would limitcosta in a different way. The amount collected in payroll taxes defines the amountavailable to pay for the least costly AHP. Thus the State contribution for HIPCcoverage cannot rise faster than wages. (However, if insurers cannot hold their costincreases at this level, there might be no 'free plan available, or the minimum benefitsmight have to be curtailed.)

Duringthe 1970s, when drug prices rose less thanthe general price level, the drug industryearned an average return on stockholders'equity (after taxes) of 18.4%. But in the1980s, when drug prices rose faster thanthe general price level, the industry's re-turn rose to 21.2%.No single factor accounts for thisincrease in drug price inflation. Rather, theexplanation lies in the dynamic interplay ofa host of factors, some of which took rootbefore the 1980s. By most authoritativeaccounts, the key ones have been a progres-sive shortening of the period when a drug-maker can expect to earn monopoly profitson a drug and continuing increases in thecost of developing, testing, and marketingnew innovative drugs. One effect of thesetrends has been to step up the pressure onpharmaceutical firms to squeeze as muchprofit as possible from a drug while it isprotected by a patent.01-0/-93 Those who favor Federal regulation ofprescription drug prices say prices shouldbe controlled because the recent surge inprices has severely strained the budgets ofthe biggest users of prescription drugs --the elderly and the chronically ill -- andbecause the pharmaceutical industry hasused most of the higher profits generatedby the price increases to develop duplicativeor 'me-tocimedications and to under-take costly marketing campaigns.Opponents of Government regulation ofprescription drug prices counter that anyrestrictions on the ability of pharmaceuticalfirms to set their prices would undercut themost potent incentive for investment innew drug development:the prospect ofearning a return on investment consistentwith the high costs and risks involved insuch an enterprise. They also point outthat even with the rapid climb in drugprices in recent years many drug therapiesare still much cheaper than alternativetreatments, such as surgery and psycho-therapy.A number of bills to restrain prescrip-tion drug prices were introduced in the102nd Congress. Some were intended tooffset the higher drug costs for Federalagencies and health insurance programswhich are related to a 1990 Federal lawmandating drug price rebates under theMedicaid program. None of the bills, how-ever, would have imposed comprehensivecontrols on the prices manufacturers couldcharge.

Congressional Research Service The Library of Congress 365*tT,. 362 IB92097 01-07-93 ISSUE DEFINMONSharp increases in the prices for a wide range of branded (or brand-name)prescription drugs since the early 1980s, coupled with the high and rising initial pricescharged for a number of innovative drugs in recent years, sparked a heated debate inthe 102nd Congress over controlling drug prices. A number of bills to restrain drugprice inflationespecially as it affected Federal spending on prescription drugs wereintroduced. The crux of the issue for that and the next Congress lies in striking abalance between the importance of allowing pharmaceutical firms sufficient financialincentive to keep supplying existing drugs and investing in the development of new,more effective ones, and the insistence of most people especially the elderly andchronically illon having unlimited and affordable access to needed medicines. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISUnlike the 1970s, prescription drug prices have risen much faster than the generalprice level since 1980 (see table 1). Between 1980 and 1985, the Consumer Price Index(CPI) for prescription drugs, which is a gauge of price change for these drugs at theretail level, went up at an average annual rate of 10.6%, compared to 5.5% for the CPIfor all items; and from 1985 to 1991, the CPI for prescription drugs increased at anaverage annual rate of 8.9%, compared to 4.0% for the overall CPI. Also unlike the1970s, prescription drug prices have gone up faster than the overall cost to consumersof medical care since the early 1980s. Largely as a result, the share of total U.S.spending on health care accounted for by producer sales of prescription drugs increasedfrom 4.5% in 1980 to an estimated 5.5% in 1990.Since the 1970s prescription drug prices have also risen faster than consumerincomes: from 1980 to 1991, the CPI for prescription drugs went up at an averageannual rate of 9.6%, compared to 6.2% for U.S. per-capita disposable income, measuredin current dollars. This disparity suggests that the average consumer has had to giveup an increasing share of his or her income to buy needed drugs.It appears that the vast share of the increase in. prescription drug prices over thepast decade is due to price hikes for branded drugs both those still protected by apatent (i.e., single-eource drugs) and those whose patent has expired (i.e., multiple-source originator or innovator drugs). According to a 1990 study by Joseph Thomasand Stephen Schondelmeyer of the School of Pharmacy at Purdue University, a retailprice index they constructed for 104 of the most commonly prescribed drugs for theelderly rose at an average annual rate of 7.2% from December 1981 to December 1988.By contrast, the price index for all single-source drugs in the sample rose at rate of7.4%; that for all multiple-source originator drugs, at a rate of 8.4%; and that for allgeneric drugs, at a rate of 2.7%. Generic drugs, which are the biochemical equivalentof branded drugs, tend to be much lower in price for two reasons. One is that, largelyse a result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984(P.L. 98-417), it costs far less to bring generic drugs to the market; and the second isthat there are no patent barriers to entering the market for these drugs.

From 1970 to 1980, when the general rateof inflation was 81% higher than the rate of drug price inflation, the average return onsales (after taxes) in the drug industry came to 10.5% and the average return onstockholders' equity (after taxes) to 18.4%. However, from 1980 to 1990, whenprescription drug prices increased more than twice as fast as the general price level, thedrug industry earned an average after-tax return on sales of 13.0%, and an averageafter-tax return on equity of 21.2% (see Table 2). In 1991, the industry's return onsales was 15.2%, and its return on equity 26.0%. This increase in profitability alsoreflects the efforts by many U.S. pharmaceutical firms since the early 1980s to cut theiroperating costs, especially by exploiting the economies of scale in marketing andresearch and development (R&D) made possible by a spate of mergers and jointventures. CRS-2 367 364 IB92097 01-07-93 Traditionally, the drug industry has earned a higher return on investment thanmost other industries. For example, during the 1970s, the average after-tax return onstockholders' equity was 18.4% in the drug industry, compared with 12.8% for allmanufacturing industries. The escalation in drug price inflation since the early 1980shas helped widen the gap. From 1980 to 1990, the average after-tax return on equityfor the drug industry was 21.1%, and for manufacturing 11.9%. While many factorsaccount for the relatively high profitability of the drug industry, two of the moreimportant are the patent protection given new drugs, and the high risk of failure incommercializing drug compounds synthesized in the laboratory, which predisposesinvestors to reek above-normal returns on their equity investments in pharmaceuticalfirms.

There is reason to believe that thesegroups bear a disproportionately large share of the rise in prescription drug prices andare suffering great hardships as a result.The elderly we the largest users of prescription drugs among major age groups.According to a 1990 study by the School of Pharmacy at Purdue University, those age65 and over represented 12.4% of the population in 1988 but accounted for 34.3% ofretail spending on prescription drugs. And the US. Bureau of Labor Statistics reportsthat in 1989, the average American consumer spent $240 on drugs both prescriptionand over-the-counterbut the average person age 65 or over spent $428.Furthermore, the incomes of the elderly tend to be much lower than other adults, andthey are much more likely to pay the full cost of prescription drugs. According tofigures compiled by the US. Bureau of the Census, the median income in 1990 forhouseholds whose chief owner or renter was 65 years of age or older was about one-halfthe level for all other households: $16,855 versus $33,920. And a 1990 report byThomas and Schondelmeyer of the School of Pharmacy at Purdue University found thatin 1988 households whose reference person was 65 years or older spent \"almost threetimes as much\" of their own money for p:escription drugs as all other households. TheHealth Care Financing Administration reports that for Americans of all ages, out-of-pocket funds accounted for 55%, private health insurance for 26%, and public healthcare programsmostly Medicaidfor about 19% of retail prescription drug purchasesin 1990.Drug Price Increases: Underlying CausesNo single factor explains the escalation in prescription drug price inflation sincethe early 1980s. Rather, it appears that the explanation lies in the dynamic interplayof a number of trends, many of which started before the 1980s. Six in particular haveexerted a powerful influence over recent pricing patterns:(1) the increased vulnerability of sellers of branded prescription drugs tocompetition from cheaper generic substitutes as a result of the Drug PriceCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984;(2) moves by increasing numbers of large buyers of and third-party payers forprescription drugs to set maximum reimbursement levels for certain classes ofdrugs and to restrict coverage of drug expenses to a list of approved drugs, manyof which are generic substitutions;(3) an apparent sharp rise in the cost of developing and gaining marketingapproval for new drugs since the late 1970s;(4) the growing reliance of pharmaceutical firms on costly marketing campaignsmainly directed at physicians but increasingly at consumers as a vehicle forprotecting or expanding market share; CRS-4 3 61/ 366 1892097 01-07-93 (5) a slowdown in the rate of growth in domestic demand for prescription drugsduring the 1980s; and(6) a steady but gradual erosion of the period when a new, pioneering drug facesno competition from other patented drugs offering comparable therapeuticbenefits.In combination, these forces have increased the pressure on the pharmaceuticalindustry to obtain as much profit as poesible from drugs during the period they are protected by a patent. The industry has sought to do this largely by aggressivelyincreasing prices for existing drugs and charging high initial prices for newly approveddrugi. As a result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of1984, the effective patent life of a drug developed after 1984 can stretch to a maximumof 14 yearsout of a possible 17 years. Arguably, by raising prices for patented drugsrapidly, pharmaceutical firms are trying to achieve three aims at once: (1) recoupingtheir huge investments in developing and marketing drugs; (2) raising the'even largersums of money needed to search for new highly successful drugs; and (3) insuring thatstockholders receive an adequate return on their investments. Because the demand formany prescription drugs tends to respond little (if at all) to changes in price and makersof patented drugs face little or no effective competition for those drugs, an increase inthe price of such a drug is likely to raise the producer's operating profits. Arguments in Favor of Regulating Prescription Drug PricesMany critics of recent pricing trends in the pharmaceutical industry favorimposing some kind of Federal regulation on the ability of manufacturers to set theirown prices. Four arguments commonly are advanced to support this position.1. Price Increases Have Made Many Needed Drugv too Costly for the LargestGroups of Users: This argument addresses the social welfare or equity effects of drugprice increases. Critics claim that two of the largest groups of users of prescription drugsnamely, the chronically ill and the elderly are least able to afford the recent climbs in prices, as well as the high initial prices being charged for a hoot ofbreakthrough drugs. Compared to the average working adult, their incomes are likely to be lower and their purchases of prescription drugs less likely to be covered by publicor private health insurance. Critics also point out that continued rapid increases indrug prices eventually will hurt all consumers by forcing public and private healthinsurers to raise premiums and copaymenta. Price controls, it is argued, are needed to insure that everyone has unrestricted, timely, and affordable access to the drugs theyrequire.2. Price Increases Have Been Intended Mainly to Boost Profits: Critics chargethat the sharp hikes in drug prices over the past decade have been intended primarilyto boost the profits of pharmaceutical firms, not to cover increases in the cost ofdeveloping, testing, and marketing new drugs as some industry executives maintain.To hack this charge, they cite the large increases in pharmaceutical industry profits in the 1980. (see table 2).(It is worth noting tbat as a matter of standard accountingpractice these increases allow for the industry's spending on R&D and marketing,which is considered a current coat of doing busineu and thus is deducted from totalrevenues in computing net income.) 3CRS-5 367 IB92097 01-07-93 3. Profiti From Higher Prices Have Been Used to Develop and Market *Me-Too\" Drugs: A third argument raised by some proponents of Government regulationof prescription drug prices concerns what the pharmaceutical industry has done withits increase in profits. They contend that the vast share of new prescription drugsintroduced in the United States is intended to compete with existing drugs in a giventherapeutic class. At a bearing held by the Senate Special Committee on Aging in July1989, Senator Pryor stated that 'Tor every breakthrough product they invent, Americandrug companies bring 24 drugs to the market that provide little or no therapeutic gainover already-marketed drugs.\" Moreover, these same critics accuse pharmaceutical firmsof plowing moat of their profits into augmenting their marketing and sales efforts.Therefore, it is argued, unless the Federal Government restricts the ability of producersto raise prescription drug prices, the industry will pour ever larger sums of money intodeveloping and marketing so-called 'me-too' drugs.4. US. Consumers Subsidize Pharmaceutical R&D for Most Other Nations:Some contend that prescription drug prices should be controlled so that Americanconsumers no longer are forced to pay for a disproportionate share of worldwidepharmaceutical R&D and marketing. In the view of these critics, the fundamentalreason for this tendency is that the United States remains the only major nationalmarket where sellers of prescription drugs are free to set their own prices. As a result,it is argued, drug prices tend to be higher in the United States than other majorgeographic markets. One effect of these disparities is that U.S. consumers subsidize theresearch and marketing done by the pharmaceutical industry in major national marketswhere prices are controlled, especially Canada, Japan, and the European Community(EC).Arguments Against Regulating Prescription Drug PricesOpponents of Federal price controls on prescription drugs -- especially brand-nameonesraise at least four arguments in defense of their position.1. Pharmaceutical Innovation Is Costly and Risky: This argument concerns thesubstantial costs and risks associated with brineng new drugs to the market. Variousstudies have estimated that these costs have risen substantially since the early 1960s.Accorc ing to a 1990 study by the Center for the Study of Drug Development at TuftsUniversity, the pre-tax average total cost of developing and gaining FDA approval fora new drug is $231 million (in 1987 dollars); this estimate includes both the opportuni-ty costs of the money tied up in developing new drug compounds both those that failand those that succeedand the direct costs to companies of compounds that fail towin FDA approval. In addition, the odds against commercializing a new drug compoundare very large: industry estimates of the chances of successfully commercializing acompound synthesised in a research laboratory range from one in four thousand to onein ten thousand.Opponents of Federal regulation of prescription drug prices argue that pricecontrols would be likely to keep drug companies from earning a return on theirinvestments in research and development that is consistent with the huge costs andriskr they must bear. And if this were to happen over a long period, it is feared,pharmaceutical firms eventually would respond by slashing their spending on R&D.CRS-6 37' 368 IB92097 01-07-93 Sustained cutbacks in R&D spending, it is claimed, would eventually diminish the flowof new breakthrough drup from the laboratory to the marketplace.2.Drug Therapy Is Often Much Cheaper Than Alternative Treatments:Opponents of price controls on prescription drup also argue that such controls couldprove counterproductive in the long run. The reason is that innovations in drugtherapy can and do lower the Nation's bill for health care. The PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association (PMA) maintains that despite the price increases and thehigh initial prices for many new breakthrough drugs approved since the early 1980s,prescription drup continue to offer the most cost-effective of the available therapies(including surgery or psychotherapy) for a number of disorders. For example, it pointsout in the 1991 edition of its Statistical Fact Book that the cost of using drugs to treatulcers runs from $200 to $500 a year, but the coat of ulcer surgery ranges from $7,200to $14,500. Moreover, a 1990 study by the Battelle Medical Technology and PolicyResearch Centerwhich was sponsored by the Schering-Plough Corporation --estimated that between 1990 and 2016, expected advances in drug therapy for heartdisease alone could save $211 billion in health care costs and prevent five million deathsand another nine million new cases.3. Competition I. the Most Efficient Way to Restrain Drug Prices: A thirdargument against regulating prescription drug prices is that unfettered competition, notGovernment regulation, is the most efficient way in the long run to restrain priceincreases and push them down to the level of lowest average cost. And opponents ofsuch regulation contend that the pharmaceutical industry has long been highlycompetitive. According to data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the fourlargest U.S. makers of pharmaceutical preparations accounted for 22%, the eight largestfor 36%, the twenty largest for 65%, and the fifty largest for 88% of U.S. shipments in1987, the most recent year for which figures are available. These figures suggest thatthe structure of the industry is not perfectly competitive. More specifically, it can besubdivided into two levels: at one level are clusters of firms (innovative and generic)competing in the same class of drugs by selling products that may differ in price ortherapeutic effects or both, and at the other level are firms selling patented drugs andearning monopoly profits.4.Prim Control' Would Undermine the Competitiveness of USPharmaceutical Firms: Some opponents of regulating prescription drug pricescontend that controlling prices will weaken the international competitiveness of U.S.-based pharmaceutical firms. Controls will lead to lower prices in the long run, andlower prices would alio lead to lower revenues in the long run as the demand for drugsis insensitive to price changes. If revenues fall or rise more slowly, companies wouldhave less money to invest in R&D, all other things being equal. Cuts in R&D spendingcarry a high risk of slowing the rate of introduction of new drugs, and new drugs arethe mainspring for growth in the pharmaceutical business. In a 1991 report on theinternational competitiveneu of the US. pharmaceutical industry, the U.S. Internation-al Trade Commission concluded that the *high degree of competitiveness' shown by theindustry during the 1980. can be traced to its stunning success in developing newproducts that generated huge revenues throughout the world from 1975 to 1989. 372CRS-7 369 1B92097 01-07-93Drug Price Rebates Under MedicaidSince 1938 the Federal Government has regulated the safety of drugs sold in theUnited States, and since 1962 it has required that all new drugs meet certain stringentstandards of efficacy before they can be approved for use. But until the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90, P.L. 101-508) was signed into law on Nov. 5, 1990, the Federal Government made no effort to force drug firms to reduce theirprices in any of the markets they sell in.The Federal role in phartuaceutical industry pricing changed markedly on Jan. 1, 1991. Beginning that day, companies selling prescription drugs to Medicaid recipientshave had to give State Medicaid programs the same deep discounts sometimes as much as 60% off the average wholesale price they traditionally offered other large buyers, such as VA hospitals and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Thesediscounts take the form of periodic rebates by manufacturers for prescription drugsdispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries at retail pharmacies in all States. The new rules on drug reimbursement, which were a provision of OBRA 90, are intended to reduceFederal and State payments for prescription drugs under Medicaid, which amounted to$4.4 billion in fiscal year (FY) 1990. In late 1990, the Congressional Budget Officeestimated that the rebates could save the Federal Government $1.9 billion and Stategovernments $1.4 billion in Medicaid expenditures from FY1991 through FY1996.Although sales under Medicaid represent between 12% and 15% of the U.S. marketfor prescription drugs, most industry executives strongly opposed the rebate program. They feared that the rebates would pave the way for similar Government limits on the prices charged for drugs dispensed under Medicare, which accounts for around 19% ofthe domestic market for pharmaceutical preparations, and eventually for drugspurchased under private health insurance plans.Some pharmaceutical firms responded to the Medicaid rebates by reducing or eliminating the deep discounts they had been offering certain large buyers, includinghospital chains, public health clinics, HMOs, and VA hospitals. In testimony at a hearing held by the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Hospitals and HealthCare on Sept. 11, 1991, Anthony Principi, the Deputy Secretary of the Department ofVeterans Affairs, stated that his agency expected to pay an additional $60 million fordrugs in FY1991 because of the price increases sparked by the Medicaid rebates. Apartfrom angering supporters of the Medicaid rebates in the Congress, the efforts of thepharmaceutical industry to offset the effects of the rebates on sales spurred theintroduction of a number of bills in the 102nd Congress to lower and contain the cost to various Federal agencies and programs and federally assisted entities of purchasingprescription drugs.Proposals in the 102nd Congressto Control Drug PricesA number of bills to either restrain prescription drug price rises or lower the cost of prescription drugs to certain Federal agencies and health care programs were introduced in the 102nd Congress. A few were considered by the House and theSenate, and oneH.R. 5193was enacted. None of the initiatives were intended to restrict prescription drug prices at the retail level.CRS-8 370 IB92097 01-07-93 Of the bills considered but not enacted, one of the most controversial was S.2000, introduced by Senator Pryor. Among other things, S. 2000 (along with' itscounterparts in the House: H.R. 4490 and H.R. 4594) sought to rein in drug priceinflation by reducing (according to a complicated formula) the Federal income taxcreditmanufacturer can earn under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code of1986 if it raises its prices for patented or generic drugs more than the increase inthe overall Consumer Price Index. S. 2000 and its House counterparts never werereported out of the committees to which they were initially referred, but a modifiedversion of S. 2000 was debated in the Senate in early March 1992 as a floor amend-ment to H.R.On Mar. 11, 1992, the amendment was rejected by a vote of 61-36.The bill that was enacted, H.R.. 5193 The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 P.L. 102-685, combines elements from a number of other legislative proposals,including H.R. 2890 and S. 2575. Title VI of the Act sets limits on the prices thatmanufacturers can charge for drugs sold to various Federal agencies (including theVeterans Administration) and alters the minimum rebates for prescription drugsunder the Medicaid program. The Act contains the following provisions on drugpricing:the prices paid for drugs by the Indian Health Service, the VA, the PublicHealth Service (PHS), and clinics and hospitals receiving Federal assistanceunder the Public Health Service Act or the prices charged through the FSScannot be used to calculate the \"best prices\" for the Medicaid drug pricerebates, as of Oct. 1, 1992;drug firms must make all their drugs available for purchase through theFSS;drug firms are required to offer specified federally assisted clinics andhospitals (e.g., a migrant health center) at least the same discounts theymust give State Medicaid programs;beginning Jan. 1, 1993, drugs purchased by the VA, the Defense Depart-ment, and the PHS through the FSS or the vA depot contracting systemmust be sold atminimum discount of 24% below the non-Federal averagemanufacturers' price; andthe minimum Medicaid rebates for single-source drugs and multiple-sourceinnovative drugs become 15.7% from Oct. 1, 1992 to Dec. 31, 1993; 15.4%in calendar year 1994; 15.2% in calendar in everyyear thereafter.Outlook in the 103rd CongressIn part because of pledges made by President-elect Clinton during the electioncampaign to enact legislation that restrains increases in the coat of health care, many think the iesue of regulating prescription drug prices (especially the pricescharged outside Federal programs) is likely to receive considerable attention early inthe 103rd Congress. Indeed, discussions about price controls reportedly are already CRS-9 374 371 I592097 01-07-93 taking place between representatives of the pharmaceutical industry and officials ofthe Clinton Administration transition team. Many concerns are likely to colorwhatever congressional debate on the issue occurs. Some of the more pressing andproblematic ones are (1) the likely impact of price controls on new drug developmentin the United State*, (2) the link between drug pricing and the uncommonly highprofits earned by drug firms, (3) the tendency of major pharmaceutical firms tospend more on advertising and promotion than on research and development, (4) therole of federally funded research in the discovery and pricing of new innovativedrugs, and (5) the benefits to the pharmaceutical industry of existing Federal taxlaws.

Washington, General Accounting Office, 1991. p. PurPoseFor two decades, the growth of health care spending in the UnitedStates has outpaced the growth of the rest of the economya patternwith troubling consequences for business, consumers, and government.Persistent pressures caused by rising spending have called forth variousremedies, but success in containing spending has been elusive! Conse-quently, policymakers and analysts have sought insights from the expe-rience of industrialized countries that appear to control spending growthbetter, provide universal access to health care, enjoy better health, andspend a smaller share of their national income on health care.The Ranking Minority Member, Senate Special Committee on Agingasked GAO to report on the lessons that the United States can draw fromindustrialized countries that spend less on health care. The Chairmen ofthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senarc speciCommittee on Aging later joined in this request. In respoAse, this repor Z(1) describes how three of these countriesFrance, Ge many, andJapanorganize their health insurance systems, achie re universal cov-erage, and regulate payments to providers; (2) describes the policiesused in each country to contain spending for physician and hospitalcare; and (3) determines whether these policies were effective in moder-ating the rise in health spending. Background A rapid escalation in spending and a noticeable narrowing of accesscharacterize the recent experience of the US. health care system.Between 1970 and 1990, the share of national income spent on healthcare grew by more than half: from 7.3 percent of gross national product(GNP) in 1970 to 12.3 percent in 1990; projections to the year 2000 implya share that would most likely exceed 16 percent. Notwithstanding thehigh and rising level of spending, more people lack ready access tohealth care. Between 1979 and 1987, the number of Americans withouthealth insurance rose by a fourthfrom 29.9 million to 37.4 million.Other industrialized countries have had more success than the UnitedStates in controlling health care spending while also providing health/insurance to virtually all their citizens. For example, France, Germany,and Japan each spends a significantly smaller share of its nationalIncome on health care than does the United States (see fig. 1). The lowerspending in these countries has not meant less access to basic health .The cower:rumors of rng tresIth sperebog ere described in tt Proposals for Reform (GAO/ ; Orrecordvenous =Wirt tomatoes moored to the same Care SP...MU C..a\" C 379 376 Eseeselve Seuneme3 services or deterioration in broad measures of health status, such as lifeexpectancy and infant mortality. novo 1: Hoeft C. Spending asPore of Gross Doroalic Product (1149)Pirrone13 15 / This study examines the policies that have been used in France, Ger-many, and Japan to control health care spending. In conducting thisanalysis, GAO obtained data on health expenditures and health status,reviewed literature on each country's health care system, and inter-viewed experts from the United States and from each of the comitiesreviewed. nAo also analyzed the likely effects of various spending con-trol policies and statistically estimated the effects of several policies'effectiveness. Our statistical analysis was limited to France and Ger-many for technical reasons.,Results in Brief France, Germany, and Japan achieve near-universal health insurancecoverage within health care systems that share three major traits with Unkk, J.P.n. France nd Germany 377 Execative Summery the US. system: (I) medical care is provided by private physicians andby both private and public hospitals, and patients have free choice ofphysician; (2) most people receive health insurance coverage throughtheir workplace; and (3) health insurance is provided by multiple third-party insurers.These similarities to the US. system coexist with several notable differ-ences that follow from the far-reaching regulations used to guaranteecoverage. First, insurerswho are predominantly non-profitarerequired to provide minimum coverage that includes a wide range ofhealth care benefits. Second, insurance enrollment is compulsory (withminor exceptions) for all residents, and they have little or no choice ofinsurers. Third, workplace-based insurance is fmanced not by premiumsthat reflect each individual group's expected costs of care, but largelyby employer and employee payroll contributions that reflect the averagecost of a larger cross section of the population.In addition to mandating insurance coverage, all three countries stand-ardize reimbursement rates for almost all physicians and hospitals andset ceilings (price controls) on these rates., Virtually all payers must,when reimbursing providers, abide by the standardized rates. Reim-bursement rates are not promulgated by the government unilaterally,but emerge from formal or informal negotiations between physicians,hospitals, third-party payers, and (in France and Japan) thegovernment.Budget controlspolicies that augment price controls by setting limitson overall spending for hospital care or for physician servicescanmoderate spending growth, particularly when they are enforced. Eachcountry sets limits on overall health spending as national goals, but onlyFrance and Germany have added policies with teeth to achieve compli-ance with the limits.GAOestimated that French budget controls, between1984 and 1987, reduced real (inflation-adjusted) hospital spending by asmuch as 9 percent, compared with what would have been spent hadprice controls alone been used. Likewise, ono estimated that for physi-cian care services, German budget controls reduced real spending by asmuch as 17 percent between 1977 and 1987, compared with what wouldhave been spent without the budget controls. By contrast, overallspending limits on German hospitals did not reduce spending growth; .Inackhrann, U three =WT. hive .ne murals on Eareutive Armory these limits were not, however, accompanied by a mechanism to achievecompliance.The budget controls that successfully moderated spending growth inFrance and Germany are not a panacea for concerns about spending.Budget controls have not relieved all pressures on spending, in partbecause these controls have not been applied to all segments of thehealth care industry. Moreover, budget controls do not assure high-quality care or efficient delivery of services. In light of these concerns,both France and Germany are exploring modifications and supplementsto their current strategies for controlling the rise in health spending. GAO's Analysis Three Countries' HealthCare Systems RetainPrivate Medicine, PatientChoiceIn France, Germany, and Japan, as in the United States, patients gener-ally can choose their own physician; outpatient services are provided byprivate physicians; and inpatient care is provided In both private andpublic hospitals. Physicians who provide outpatient services are paid ona fee-for-service basisas are most U.S physicians. (Unlike in theUnited States, however, physicians who deliver inpatient care are oftenemployed by a hospital on a salaried basis.) Countries Provide AllResidents With HealthInsurance ThroughRegulated MultipayerSystemsEach country guarantees virtually all their residents health insurancethat offers a broad minimum level of benefits. Near-universal coverageis achieved by making enrollment for health insurance compulsory, withfew exceptions, and virtually automatic. Health insurance is providedthrough a diverse mix of third-party payers that emerged from eachcountry's particular social institutions and political history. Independentaction by each payer is limited due to national regulation of enrollment,benefits, premiums, and reimbursement of providers. Broad Package of BenefitsIs MandatedThe mandated package of health benefits covers a wide range of ser-vices. Benefits generally include coverage for physician services, hos-pital care, laboratory tests, prescription drugs, and some dental andoptical care. Patients in all three countries do not pay deductibles forhealth care services; copayments for physician and hospital care rangefrom nominal amounts in Germany to as much as 20 to 30 percent ofregulated fees In France and Japan. Page 6 GAO/KEDAH Mats Gum Ikposlygeorzoi 3.i2 379 Eatecadve SONVI627 Insurance Financed byPayroll-BasedContributions FromEmployer and EmployeeWorkplace-based insurance in France, Germany, and Japan is largelyfinanced by mandatory payroll conbibutions from both employees andemployers. In contrast to private insurance fmancing in the UnitedStates, which generally reflects each individual group's expected costsof care, these mandatory contributions reflect the average cost of alarger cross section of the population than typically used by US.insurers in calculating premiums. (In France and Japan, payroll-basedfmancing is supplenamted by subsidies from general tax revenues.) Countries Set NationalLimits on Spending andRequire Uniform PaymentRatesEach country has national procedures for setting limits on health carespending and for determining standardized reimbursement rates forproviders. Generally, a government agency or other authorized bodysets broad targets for all or some components of health care spending.The targets may serve as guidelines or they may be binding. Nationallaws also require that payers reimburse providers according to ratesthat are, for the most part, uniform; a given service is usually reim-bursed at the same rate, regardless of payer.Each country also has a formal process for setting payment rates forphysicians and hospitals. The health care system's major stake-holdersthird-party payers, physicians and hospitals, and (in Franceand Japan) the governmentparticipate in this rate-setting process. InFrance and Germany, the rates are set in formal negotiations. In Japan,they are set by the government in consultation with a body that repre-sents insurers and health care providers. Countries Adopt DirectControls on Prices andOverall Spending 64-300 09313Seeking to moderate the rise in health care spending, all three countrieshave imposed direct controls on health care prices and overall spending.These controls are comprehensiveapplying to the entire health careindustry or to a major health care sector. By use of standardized pay-ments. mandated coverage, and mandated benefits, the three countrieshave alleviated a potential problem with direct controls, known as costshifting (that is, providers offset both the cost of charity care and thelower reimbursement from some patients' insurers by raising charges toother, more generous insurers). Page II GA0/1019.1241 Beath Care SgestLagOagro 3S3 Budget Controls WithTeeth Work Better ThanPrice Controls atContaining Spending Hospital Spending in France andGermany Physician Care Spending inGermany380 France and Germany implemented budget controls that were subject todifferent degrees of enforcement Germany, starting in the late 1970s;France in the mid-1980s. These controls supplemented or replaced pricecontrols that were already in place. Both countries set annual targets tolimit total spending on hospital services, and Germany set targets and,later, caps to limit total spending on outpatient physician services. ono'seconometric analyses confirm that stringent enforcement mattes budgetcontrols more effective.Spending limits restrained hospital spending in France but not in Ger-many. Beginning in 1984, the French government replaced its fuced dailyrates for hospital care with targets for total public hospital spending. Toenhance compliance with the targets, the government participates inbudget negotiations with each individual public hospital. ono estimatesthat between 1984 and 1987, the targets reduced French spending onhospitals by about 9 percent below what would have been spent hadprice controls remained in place. By contrast, Germany in 1985 estab-lished targets for total hospital spending, but did not design the meansto enforce them. GAO found no statistical evidence that the existence oftargets affected German spending for total hospital services between1985 and 1987.Stringent enforcement enhanced the effectiveness of Germany's budgetcontrols on physician spending. In 1978, Germany complemented itsexisting price controls with spending targets (though not with a formalenforcement mechanism). In 1986, however, Germany replaced targetswith caps that were binding. GAO estimates that between 1977 and 1987,Germany's use of budget controls reduced inflation-adjusted spendingby as much as 17 percent below what would have been spent on physi-cian care under price controls alone. In addition, GAO found that capsreduced the rate of spending growth more than targets. Spendinggrowth in the physician sector averaged 2 percent annually under caps .compared with 7 percent annually under targets; caps account for part,but not all, of this difference. Countries Seek AdditionalPolicies to Better RestrainSpending, Assure Quality,and Enhance EfficiencyIn the countries reviewed, budget controls that suuassfully temperedthe pace of spending growth have not relieved all pressures on spendingnor have they attempted to address concerns about the quality and effi-ciency of health care. Increased spending can be attributed, in part, tosectors not controlled through budgets, such as physician services inFrance or prescription drugs in all three countries. Continued pressureto increase health care spending in the future is also expected, as the Pax. 3 S4GA0/1111)42.4 }teat& Care SpegaftC... 381 Emend. Samara elderly's share of the population rises further and new, expensive med-ical treatments are introduced.In addition, the continued tightening of budget controls may. over time,both create political pressures for a relaxation of the controls and makea health care system less able to provide high-quality services. InFrance, new proposals for stronger budget controls recently sparkedwidespread protests by physicians. In Germany, some controls on physi-cian spending were relaxed in mid-1991 due to pressure applied by phy-sicians. With respect to quality. GAO found no evidence in the countriesreviewed of a decline in broad measures of health statis during the rela-tively brief period that budget controls were in effect. Experts inFrance, however, believe that tight hospital budgets there are discour-aging hospital maintenance and the development of innovative prom-dures. In other countries that have used budget controls for longerperiods than France and Germany, some shortages of services haveappeared, indicating the potential for problems in the long run.Health care experts in these three countries are exploring policies thatenhance ef ricient delivery and better assure quality. For example,efforts are being made in France and Germany to develop a prospectivepayment system for hospitalsfollowing the same general principlesused in the US. Medicare program since 1883that offers incentivesfor more efficient delivery of hospital care. Germany is developing pro-grams that enhance quality by increasing physician monitoring, formal-ting quality assurance procedures, and increasing the coordination ofinpatient and outpatient services.

Theabsence of catastrophic health insurants protection for the elderly was the subject ofconcern for several years. During the 130th Congress, a number of proposals wereconsidered to expand protection for the aged through the Medicare program. TheMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA, P.L. 100-360) was signed intolaw on July 1, 1988. This measure placed an upper limit on beneficiary liability inconnection with covered Medicare services. It also established 1: new catastrophicprescription drug program. The measure did not include protection against long-terminstitutional care expenditures in the benefit package.MCCA removed coinsurance and number-of-day limitations on hospital care; abeneficiary needing hospital care would pay only one inpatient deductible per year.The law modified the skilled nursing facility benefit and expanded benefits for homehealth and hospice care. The law established a maximum out-of-pocket limit (the\"catastrophic cap\") on beneficiary liability for cost-sharing charges in connection withphysicians' and other Part B services. Beginning in 1991, the law authorizedMedicare coverage for catastrophic outpatient prescription drug expenses. MCCA wasto be financed through a combination of (1) an increase in the monthly Part Bpremium for all Part B enrollees, and (2) a new supplemental premium which wasto be mandatory for all Part A enrollees with Federal tax liability (about 41% of theelderly in 1989). MCCA also contained several Medicaid provisions.Many elderly complained about the supplemental premium; many also questionedthe need for the new benefits. Further, concerns were raised regarding the rapidincrease in estimated MCCA costs. During 1989, Congress considered ways to modifyMCCA. Such modifications included developing a plan retaining a portion of theMCCA benefits, while reducing or eliminating the supplemental premium. However,a consensus could not be reached.Thus, on Nov. 22, 1989, the House and Senate cleared the Medicare CatastrophicCoverage Repeal Act of 1989 (H.R. 3607), for the President's it was signedinto law Dec. 13 (P.L. 101-234 . The Act repeals the Medicare catastrophic provisionsincluded in MCCA; however, it retains the Medicaid provisions.On Nov, 6,1990, the President signedinto law the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990; P.L. 101-508.) This legislation restored twobenefits which had been added by MCCA and removed by the repeal law coverageof mammography screening services and expansion of hospice benefits. OBRA 1990also strengthens standards relating to Medicare supplemental health insurance(medigap) policies. Reprinted from Catastrophic Health Insurance: Medicare; Issue Brief, byJennifer O'Sullivan. Washington, Congressional Research Service, 1990. 16 p. 3S7 386 15887106 11-29-90ISSUE DEFINITIONCatastrophic medical costs are broadly defined as large unpredictable health care expenses; these are usually associated with a major illness or serious injury. Further,these expenses must be the liability of the individual or family-, that is, they are not covered by so-called third parties, either private insurance or public programs. Congress passed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), which provided protection against some catastrophic costs for the elderly. After enactment, a number of issues were raised about MCCA. Of particular concern was the financing mechanism. Critics also focused on the increases in MCCA estimated costs. On Nov. 22, 1989, the House and Senate cleared the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 CI.R. 3607) for the President's signature; the measure was signed into law (P.L. 101-234) on Dec. 13, 1989. BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISInsurance Coverage for the AgedMedicare CoverageAged persons who face catastrophic health expenses do so because of gaps in their insurance coverage. Almost the entire aged population (between 95 and 96% cr 30 million persons) are covered under Medicare; in addition,the program covers 3 million disabled persons. Medicare's benefits, which are the same throughout the country, are targeted toward meeting the acute health care needs of the elderly.Prior to 1989, limits were placed on the number of coveted days of hospital care and continue to be placed on skilled nursing facility care. (The hospital limits will be restored in 1990.) Further, the program has placed no upper limit on cost sharing charges in connection with covered program services.Overall, Medicare covers about half of the aged's health care costa. The program's benefit package excludes prescription drugs, routine eye examinations, eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental care, dentures, and most preventive care. The major gap in the Medicare benefit package is coverage of long-term-care services. Nursinghome coverage is limited to short-term post-hospital stays in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Ps a result, Medicare covers less than 2% of the nursing home costs of theaged. Home health care is covered only when a beneficiary can be shown to need intermittent skilled nursing care or physical or speech therapy. Many chronically ill persons do not need skilled care to remain in their homes, but rather, need custodialcare and assistance with daily routines; home health services for these persons are not covered by Medicare.Other Insurance ProtectionThe majority of Medicare beneficiaries have had some insurance protection inaddition to Medicare coverage. The largest group is that with Mtdigap coverage. Medigap is the term used to describe individually purchased policies designed toCRS-2 358 387 IB87106 11-29-90 supplement Medicare's coverage. Approximately 39% of the noninstitutionalizedMedicare population purchased private health insurance policies in 1987, most ofwhich could be classified as Medigap. The principal protection offered by the majorityof these policies is coverage of Medicare's cost sharing charges; some policies mayoffer coverage of additional services. Few policies offer protection against the costsof long-term institutional care potentially the most costly service item.Regulation of insurance, including health insurance, is generally a Stateresponsibility. However, in the 1970s there were a series of reports on marketingand sales abuses with respect to health policies sold to the elderly. Congress thereforeapproved a voluntary certification program in 1980. Under the program, ticies thatwished to be certified as Medigap policies had to meet or exceed standards set forthin a model regulation approved by the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners (NAIC). The voluntary program applied only in States that failed toestablish equivalent or more stringent programs. Almost all States established theirown programs. (See MCCA summary; summary of MCCA 29% of the noninstitutinnalized Medicare population hasemployer-based health insurance coverage which may be paid in whole or partby their employers. Employer-sponsored plans are not covered by the NAIC rules.(See MCCA sumn-7v and summary of MCCA repeal for maintenance of effortprovision.)Some low-income aged and disabled Medicare beneficiaries are also covered bythe Federal-State Medicaid program. However, many of the aged do not becomeeligible for Medicaid benefits until after they become instituti,:nalized and reducetheir incomes and resources to the Medicaid standard through their expenditures onhealth care.Medicaid beneficiaries are effectively protected against the costsassociated with covered program services.Prior to MCCA, an estimated 20% of the Medicare population had no otherhealth insurance coverage. According to DIMS, this figure included over 2 millionpoor and 6 million near-poor elderly not covered by Medicaid.Enactment of MCCAPresident Reagan submitted the Administration proposal for catastrophiccoverage for the Medicare population on Feb. 24, 1987. It was seen by many inCongress as defining the minimum parameters of a Medicare expansion bill. Thefinal law differed considerably from the original Administration plan. The major benefit expansion included in the law was the new catastrophic prescription drugcoverage.Financing was a key issue during Congressional consideration of MCCA. Giventhe Federal budget deficit, it was decided that any program expansions could not relyon general revenue financing. Therefore another mechanism had to be developed.It was determined that, first, the legislation must provide the revenues for anybenefit expansions. Second, expanded benefits had to be paid for by the beneficiaries CRS-3 3S9 388 13387106 11-29-90 themselves.As the legislation was developed, there was concern that many beneficiaries would be unable to afford the cost of the improved benefits, if the cost were to be spread equally across oil beneficiaries. The law therefore provided thatthose with a greater ability to pay (as evidenced by Federal tax liability) wouldshoulder a larger portion of the costs. On the other hand, State Medicaid programs would be required to phase in coverage of Part B premium payments (and otherMedicare cost-sharing charges) for those with incomes below the poverty line.Summary of MCCAThe Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 was given final approval byCongress June 8, 1988, and signed into law as P.L. 100-360 July 1, 1988. The following are highlights of the major provisions. (For a detailed summary see CRSReport 89-165 EPW, Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988.) The hospital and SNF benefit expansions were effective Jan. 1, 1989; the remaining benefit provisions (except drugs) were to be effective Jan. 1, 1990. The catastrophic prescription drugbenefit was to be effective Jan. 1, 1991.Part A (Hospital Insurance) BenefitsPart A provides coverage for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility(SNF) services, home health care, and hospice services. Prior to the enactment of MCCA, long-term hospital stays were subject to significant coinsurance charges. Further a beneficiary could potentially exhaust all benefits; however, a very small percentage actually did so. MCCA made the following Part A changes:Inpatient Hospital Services. Specified a maximum of one hospital deductible per year ($560 in 1989) and eliminated the day limits, coinsurance charges, and spellof illness provisions.Skilled Nursing Facility Services. Required daily coinsurance payments forthe first 8 days equal to 20% of the national average Medicare reasonable cost for SNF cr.re 425.50/day in 1989); eliminated coinsurence charges for 21st-100th days; providod coverage for up to 150 days and eliminated prior hospitalizationrequirement.Home Health Services.Expanded the 'intermittent\" skilled nursing care definition so that \"daily\" care was defined as 7 days a week for up to 38 days (instead of 5 days a week for up to 2 or 3 weeks).Hospice Services. Provided that the 210 day lifetime limit could be extended.Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) BenefitsBeneficiaries enrolled in Part B pay a monthly premium ($31.90 a month in 1989).They are also liable for certain charges in connection with their use of physicians and other services covered under the program. All beneficiaries are liable for the $75 deductible and 20% coinsurance charges. In addition, where a physician or other provider does not accept \"assignment\" (i.e., agree to accept Medicare's 3 7 0CRS-4 389 IB87106 11-29-90 determination of the 'reaeonable charge' amount as payment in full for coveredservices), the beneficiary is liable for the difference between Medicare's reasonablecharge amount and the physician's actual charge. (This is sometimes referred to asthe 'balance billed' amount.) The following are the Part B changes which were madeby MCCA.Limitation on Out-of-Pocket Expenses. Establishedmaximum out-of-pocket limit (the 'catastrophic cap') on beneficiary liability for Part Bcoat-sharing charges after which Medicare would pay 100% of the approved amount(Balance billing charges would not count toward the cap; nor would Medicare paythese charges once the beneficiary hit the cap.) The limit was set at $1,370 for 1990;it was to be indexed so that a constant 7% of beneficiaries would be eligible for thiscatastrophic benefit each year.Mammography Screening. Established a new Medicare benefit. Screeningsfor women over 65 would be covered every other year, subject to a maximum paymentper screening of $50 in 1990 (indexed in future years).Respite Care. Provided covs.ege for in-home care for a chronically dependentindividual for up to 80 hours per year. The benefit was to be available only forpersons who met either the catastrophic cap or the outpatient prescription drug cap.Catastrophic Prescription Drug BenefitsMCCA established, effective Jan. 1, 1990, a limited prescription drug benefit forhome intravenous (IV) drugs and immunosuppressive drugs furnished after the firstyear following a transplant (they are already covered in the first year). Thedeductible was to be $550 in 1990; the coinsurance was to be 20% for home IV drugsand 50% for isteunosuppressives. Beginning Jan. 1, 1991, catastrophic prescriptiondrug coverage was to be available for all outpatient prescription drugs, subject to a$600 deductible and 50% coinsurance charges. The deductible was slated to go to$652 in 1992 and be indexed in future years so that 16.8% of beneficiaries wouldreach the deductible each year. The coinsurance was slated to be lowered to 40% in1992 and 20% in 1993.FinancingThe new benefits were to be financed through a combination of (1) an increasein the monthly Part B premium for all Part B enrollees, and (2) a new supplementalpremium which was to be mandatory for all those entitled to Part A who had Federaltax liability of $150 or more.Part B Premium. The additional monthly Part B premium was set in thestatute through 1993. The additional monthly amount was set at $4 in 1989, $4.90in 1990, $7.40 in 1991, $9.20 in 1992, and $10.20 in 1993.Supplemental Premium.The supplemental premium (to be collected inconjunction with the Federal income tax) was to be based on Federal tax liability (i.e.,amount of taxes owed).The supplemental premium was in effect a surtax. Thesurtax rate was to be 15% in 1989, 25% in 1990, 26% in 1991, 27% in 1992, and 28%in 1993. The maximum annual premium per enrollee was $800 in 1989, rising toCRS-5 331. 390 1E87106 11-29-90$1,050 in 1993. It was estimated that the approximate income levels at which the maximum premium amounts would be reached were $40,000 for a single return and $80,000 for a couple.Other ProvisionsMedigap Policies. MCCA amended procedures for Federal certification of Medigap policies.It provided that if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) revised its standards prior to Oct. 1, 1988, such revised standards would apply as the standard for certification. The NAIC met this deadline. Policies sold before enactment, but still in effect on Jan. 1, 1989, were deemed not to duplicate Medicare's new benefits if they complied with the NAIC model transition rule; this rule required insurers to notify beneficiaries of policy and premium changes and to make appropriate premium adjustments in their policies.Maintenance of Effort. Any employer who provides health benefits to an employee or retired former employee (including State and local employees) that duplicate at least 50% of the new or improved Part A or Part B benefits would have to provide additional benefits or refunds that totalled at least the actuarial value of the duplicative benefits. The provision was to be effective with respect to Part A benefits in 1989 and Part B benefits in 1990 except that an extension was provided to cover current collective bargaining agreements.Federal Employees. MCCA required the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to reduce, effective Jan. 1,1989, the rates charged to Medicare-eligible individuals participating in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to reflect the amounts that would have been paid by those plans except for the enactment of this bill. The reduction was $3.10 per month in 1989. OPM was also required to conduct a study of changes to FEHBP that might required to incorporate plans designed specifically for Medicare-eligible individuals.Medicaid. MCCA mandated States, on a phased-in basis, to pay Medicare premiums, deductibles and coinsurance for elderly and disabled individuals with incomes Delow the poverty line. Also, in the case of a couple where one member is institutionalized, the bill provided protection of a portion of the couple's income and resources for maintenance needs of the community spouse (the so-called spousal impoverishment provision).Estimated Impact of MCCAAll beneficiaries had increased insurance protection as a result of the new law. The Congressional Budget Office (CB0) estimated that when the legislation waa fully .implemented, approximately 22% of Medicare beneficiaries each year would have been entitled to higher benefit payments as a res, dt of the program expansions.At the time of enactment, total new benefit and administrative costs were estimated at $30.8 billion over the FY1989-93 period. This figure increased to $48.2 billion in September 1989. These costs were to be financed through the additional Part B premium and the new supplemental premium. It was estimated that 41.2% 392CRS-6 391 IB87106 11-29-90 of enrollees would pay the supplemental premium in 1989. Close to two-thirds ofthose paying the premium would pay less than $300. An estimated 5.6% of enrolleeswould pay the maximum supplemental premium in 1989.It was estimated that approximately 30% of enrollees would pay more in newpremiums (supplemental plus the new Part B) than they would receive in newbenefits. However, all persons (including those paying the maximum supplementalpremium) would still receive more in total Medicare benefits than they would pay intotal.This was true even when you included the hospital insurance payroll taxwhich was paid by these individuals (and their employers) during their working years.MCCA IssuesFollowing passage of MCCA, a number of issues were raised about the scope ofthe new legislation and its financing. Critics of the measure focused mainly on thefmancing aspects.Some persons who would be liable for the new supplementalpremium (also known as the eurtax) objected to the amount they would have beenrequired to pay for the expanded coverage. Mort persons liable for the supplementalpremium would have averaged more in total new premium charges (supplemental plusPart B) than the per capita value of the new benefits. Critics further objected to themandatory nature of the program; they felt that beneficiaries should be allowed tomake their own choices about insurance coverage.Proponents of the measure noted that, given the Federal budget deficit, it wasdecided that any program expansions could not rely on general revenu financing.Therefore another mechanism had been chosen. All beneficiariem, except those withincomes below the poverty line, would pay a portion of the additional costs. Higher-income individuals would assume higher percentage of the costs. Proponents notethat even though higher-income individuals would be paying more than the value ofthe new benefits, they would still be receiving a subsidy on the overall Medicarebenefits package. Further, financing Medicare through an income-related charge wasnot new to Medicare. The Part A program has always been financed by an income-related hospital insurance tax levied on current workers and their employers.Proponents noted that the program was mandatory rather than voluntary tohelp maintain a sound financial base. The mandatory base was intended to preventthose beneficiaries who were younger, healthier, and had higher incomes fromdropping out of the program until they were older, sicker and more likely to need theprotection.Critics noted that over three-quarters of Medicare beneficiaries already hadprivate and or public health insurance coverage in addition to Medicare. They suggested that these individuals did not need, nor in many cases want, expandedMedicare coverage. Some individuals who had their additional coverage paid for inwhole or in part by their current or former employer would have been subject to thesupplemental premium and therefore have been subject to higher total charges afterenactment of MCCA. CRS-7 393 392 1E87106 11-29-90 Proponents of the measure stated that it represented the most significantexpansion in benefits since the enactment of Medicare in 1965. They noted that thelaw was designed to fill very significant program gaps. While many enrollees had other health insurance protection, approximately 20% of the aged had no additional coverage. These individuals tended to be older, sicker and poorer than those whopurchased additional coverage.Proponents noted that Medicare is more efficient to administer than privateinsurance. They also noted that it may be difficult for those elderly with preexistingconditions to obtain affordable private coverage.Some persons suggested that persons will be paying for coverage that they will not actually use. Proponents noted that the new legislation provided catastrophicinsurance protection. As with car insurance or homeowners insurance, not everyone expects to avail themselves of the benefits each year. However, if the program had been fully implemented, an estimated 22% of beneficiaries would have been entitledto higher Medicare payments as a result of the legislation.Some critics of the catastrophic measure questioned its focus. They suggestedthat en....tment of the catastrophic proposal would, in effect, delay enactment of a long-term-care bill. They noted that the major gap in Medicare was and continued to be coverage of long-term-care services. Very few private insurers offer protectionagainst these costs. As a result, Medicaid remains the primary source of third party financing for these expenses. Many elderly at risk of needing long-term-care services face the prospect of impoverishing themselves to welfare levels in order to gain Medicaid eligibility.Congressional Action in the 101st CongressDuring the 1st Session of the 101sc Congress, both the House and Senateconaidered a number of alternative approaches to modifying MCCA. This interest was spurred in large part by the considerable opposition that was voiced by many senior citizens to imposition of the supplemental premium. It was also spurred in part by the considerable increase in estimated program costs of catastrophic benefits.Two services accounted for most of the estimated increase the expanded skilled nursing facility benefit and the prescription drug benefit.On Oct. 4, 1989, the House during its consideration of the FY1990 budgetreconciliation bill approved the amendment offered by Congressmen Donnelly andArcher by a vote of 360 to 66. This replaced the catastrophic provision approvedearlier by the Committee on Ways and Means. The House rejected the substituteamendment offered by Congressmen Stark, Gradison, and Waxman. The Donnelly/Archer amendment basically repealed the Medicare provisions and thefinancing provisions of MCCA while retaining the Medicaid provisions.On Oct. 6, 1989, the Senate by a vote of 99 - 0 approved S. 1726, as amended. This legislation was introduced by Senator McCain as a free-standing measure. (Earlier efforts by the Finance Committee to report a catastrophic agreement as part of reconciliation were unsuccessful.) The Senate's action came after a series of CRS-8 393 1B87106 11-29-90 amendments (including a repeal amendment) were disapproved. The Senate billretained the Part A thlit with the exception of the SNF benefit. It alio retainedcoverage for immunosuppressives and home W drugs, mammography services, andrespite care.The Senate bill eliminated the supplemental premium end providedbeginning in 1990 for a recalculation of the Part B premium to fund the remainingbenefits.On Nov. 8, 1989, the House passed H.R. 3607, the Medicare CatastrophicCoverage Act of 1989. The provisions of this bill were identical to the catastrophicprovisions approved by the House as part of the reconciliation bill. Also on Nov. 8,1989, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 3607. The Senate version was a revisedMcCain bill which corrected technical errors incorporated in S. 1726. The Confereesreported the meaeure on Nov. 19, 1989. The Conferees essentially reported the Houserepeal measure with a few modifications. The Senate rejected the measure twicereturning the measure to the House; the latter body insisted on the conferenceagreement. Both Houses approved the conference report with technical correction onNov. 22, 1989. The bill was signed into law (P.L. 101-234) on Dec. 13, 1989. MCCA Repeal ProvisionsThe following summarizes the provisions of H.R. 3607 as approved by Congress.Part A ProvisionsHospital and SNF Benefits. The expanded hospital and SNF benefitsauthorized by MCCA were effective Jan. 1, 1989. P.L. 101-234 restores the prior lawprovisions effective Jan. 1, 1990.Beginning Jan. 1, 1990, hospital and SNF benefits will again be tied to thebeneficiary's \"spell of illness.\" A spell of illness begins when a beneficiary enters ahospital aud ends when he or she has not been an inpatient of a hospital or SNF for60 consecutive days.A beneficiary is entitled to 90 days of hospital care per spell of illness.' Days1-60 are subject to one deductible ($592 in 1990). Days 61-90 are subject to a dailycoinsurance charge ($148 in 1990). Beneficiaries also have a total of 60 lifetimereserve days available to them. A beneficiary exceeding 90 days of care during a spellof illness may use lifetime reserve days, subject to a daily coinsurance charge ($296in 1990).Lifetime reserve days can be used only once; any such days used by abeneficiary prior to 1989 are subtracted from the total available.A beneficiary is also entitled to 100 days of SNF care per spell of illness. Thethree-day prior hospitalization requirement removed by MCCA has been restored.Days 1-20 of post-hospital SNF care are not subject to beneficiary cost-sharing. Days21-100 are subject to daily coinsurance charges ($74 in 1990).P.L. 101-234 establishes transition provisions for persons in a hospital on Jan.1, 1990 whose inpatient stay began prior to that date. For these individuals, January1, 1990 is considered to be the first day of the beneficiary's spell of illness; however, CRS-9 395 394 IB87106 11-29-90no deductible is imposed if one was imposed for such stay in 1989. Also, if a deductible was imposed on an inpatient stay beginning in Dtw!ember 1989, no deductible is to be imposed for a spell of illness beginning in January 1990. Further, no deductible is imposed on an individual whose spell of illness began prior to Jan. 1, 1990.P.L. 101-234 also establishes transition provisions for persons in a SNF on Jan. 1, 1990 whose SNF care began prior to that date. The 100 days of SNF care are deemed to start on Jan. 1, 1990. Thus, no coinsurance would be imposed on days 1- 20; the daily $74 coinsurance charge would be imposed on days 21-100. Persons in the SNF prior to Jan. 1, 1990 would not be subject to the prior hospitalization requirement The prior hospitalization requirement is also waived for persona discharged from a SNF during Dec. 1989 sna i.ifamitted in Jan. 1990 within 30 days of discharge.Home Health Benefits. The expanded home health benefits (see MCCA summary) which were to become effective Jan. 1, 1990 are repealed.Hospice Benefits. The 210 limitation is restored Jan. 1, 1990, except that it does not apply *-) persons electing hospice benefits prior to that date.Blood Deductible. P.L. 101-234 retains the MCCA provision. MCCA provided that the Part A blood deductible is to be imposed on a calendar year basis; it is to be reduced by any such deductible imposed under Part B.Part A Premium. The vast majority of the elderly are automatically eligible for Part A protection. Persons not automatically eligible may obtain coverage through payment of a monthly premium ($156 in 1989.) MCCA revised the calculation of that premium. P.L. 101-234 retains this modification.PPS Payments. MCCA provided for transitional adjustments in PPS payments to take into account the new law. Further, for PPS-exempt hospitals, it provided for an adjustment in the target amvint (the annual limit on total Medicare payments to such hospital) to take into account the additional days of care Medicare would be covering.P.L. 101-234 terminates the transitional adjustments for PPS and PPS-exempt hospitals effective Jan. 1,1990. Further,itrequires the Secretary to make appropriate adjustments in the target amount to take into account services provided to an inpatient whose stay began before Jan. 1, 110.Part B ProvisionsThe following new Part B benefits which were to become effectiNe Jan. 1, 1990 are repealed:--Limitation on out-of-pocket expenses (the so-called Part B cap) Screening mammogramsRespite careHome intravenous drug therapy services CRS-10 3 rT) 395 3887106 11-29-90Catastrophic Prescription DrugsCoverage for outpatient catastrophic prescription drugs, which was to begin ona limited basis in 1990, is repealed.MCCA required that physicians include the appropriate diagnosis code whenrequesting Medicare payment, effective Mar. 1, 1989. This requirement is retained.FinancingMCCA provided that the supplemental premium was to be effective for tax yearsbeginning after Dec. 31, 1988. P.L. 101-234 repeals this premium. While most persons would not have paid the premium until they fded their 1989 tax returns,some persons may have paid a portion of this as part of their estimated taxpayments. A separate refund of this amount will not be made. Repeal of the premium results in reduced tax liability. If an individual's total 1989 tax paymentsexceed total 1989 tax liability, a refund will be made when the individual files his orher return.MCCA also increased the monthly Part B premium by a specified amount tofund catastrophic expenses. This add-on amount was set at $4 per month in 1989and $4.90 per month in 1990. The additional premium is deducted from individual'ssocial security checks (as is the case for the basic Part B premium amount). Theadditional premium is repealed effective January 1990. Due to the late passage of therepeal leeslation, the 1990 add-on amount will be deducted for several months untilthe system can be appropriately modified. Any resulting overpayment will be refunded.MCCA extended indefinitely the hold harmless provision. This provision prohibitsa beneficiary's check from dropping as a result of an increase in the Part B premium.This indefinite extension is retained.MCCA also ertablished several new trust funds and accounts. PL. 101-234repeals the Federal Hospital Insurance Catastrophic Coverage Reserve Fund, theFederal Catastrophic Drug Insurance Trust Fund, and the Medicare CatastrophicCoverage Account.MCCA required the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congressby Nov. 30, 1988 on Federal tax policies to promote the private financing of long-term care. P.L. 101-234 delays the reporting date until May 31, 1990.Medigap Certification Requirements. MCCA amentla4 orocedures for Federalcertification of to reflect enactment of catastrophic coverage. (Seeabove.)P.L. 101-234 amends the requirements to reflect repeal of catastrophiccoverage.P.L. 101-234 provides a period of 90 days beginning with enactment forthe NAIC to revise their model medigap regulation to improve such regulation andotherwise to reflect benefit changes made by the new law. The revised regulationwould apply inState effective on the date the State adopts Medigap standardsequal to or more stringent than the revised regulation or one year after the date theCRS-11 397 396 11187106 11-29-90NAIC fine adopts such revised regulation. If the NA1C does not revise the model regulation within 90 days, the Secretary must promulgate revimed Federal model 'tendert]s within the aubeequent 60 day period. Those standards would become effective on the earlier of the date the State adopts the standards equal to or more rtringent than the revised standards or one year after the date the Secretary promulgates the standards.After the date the revised regulation (or the revised Federal model standards) are effective in a State, no Medigap policy may be certified by the Secretary and no Secretarial certification may remain in effect unless the policy meets the revised NAIC model standards (or the revised Federal model standards.)P.L. 101-234 defmes a transition deadline se one year after the NAIC adopts the revised model regulation, or one year after the Secretary promulgates revieed Federal model standards, as the case may be. Medigap policies issued after the transition deadline must comply with the revised NAIC model regulation or the Federal model standards to be in compliance. Medigap policies issued before the transition deadline are deemed to be in compliance with the new standards if they comply with a transition provision to be issued by the NAIC no later than Dec. 16, 1989 (or failing that, by the Secretary by Jan. 1, 1990.) The NAIC transition provision ceases to apply on the earlier of either the date the State adopts standards equal to or more stringent than the revised NAIC model regulation (or the revised Federal model standards, if appropriate) or the date established for States requiring leeslative action.Medigap policies in effect on Jan. 1, 1990 would not meet the standards unless each policy holder or certificate holder who is eligible for Medicare is sent a notice by Jan. 31, 1990 explaining the changes in Medicare's benefits resulting from catastrophic repeal legislation and how these changes affect the policy's benefits and premium.Continuation Provision. Special rules are established in the case of an individual who had a Medigap supplemental policy in effect as of Dec. 31, 1988 with an insurer (as a policy holder, or in the case of a group policy, a certificate holder) and terminated this policy before enactment of PL. 101-234. The insurer must offer such policy holder or certificate holder (through written notice between Dec. 15, 1989 and Jan. 30, 1990) reinstitution coverage. The individual must be offered during a period of at least 60 days (beginning not later than Feb. 1, 1990) reinstitution coverage, with coverage effective as of Jan. 1, 1990. The offering must be under the terms which: (1) do not provide for any waiting period for treatment of pre-existing conditio-ns; (2) provide for coverage which is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of such termination; and (3) provide for classification of premiums on terms which are at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification which would have applied to that person had the coverage not been terminated. An insurer is not required to make this offer in the case of a policyholder or certificate holder in another Medigap policy as of the date of enactment of P.L. 101-234 if under that policy, as of Jan. 1, 1990, the individual is not subject to a waiting period with respect topre-existing condition.Mectigap Premiums. In November 1989, the GAO conducted a survey of commercial Medigap insurers to determine the expected increase in Medigap premiums in 1990. For the 20 companies reporting, the average monthly premium 3'CRS-12 397 1B87106 11-29-90 was $58.71 in 1989. In the absence of repeal legislation, the estimated average 1990monthly premium would be $60.10 in 1990. Repeal of MCCA would result in a 15.4percent or $9.25 average incr o.... in the 1990 monthly premiums. This representedincreases ranging from 6.3% to 41.3% across reporting companies.The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association estimated the impact of repeal onmember plans. A typical nongroup Medicare product costs an estimated $50 to $55per month in 1989. Repeal of MCCA would result in increases of $8 to $24 permonth in 1990.Other ProvisionsP.L. additional MCCA provisions, effective Jan.1, 1990:Maintenance of effort. The repeal does not apply to duplicative Part Abenefits for periods before Jan. 1, 1990. (See summary of MCCA above.)Rate reduction for Federal annuitants.OPM study of offering Medigap policies to Federal annuitants (This atudyhas already been issued.)Benefits counseling and assistance demonstration project.Case management demonstration projects.Advisory Committee on Medicare home health claims.Research on long-term-care services for Medicare beneficiaries.Study of adult day health services.The following provisions were retained:United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care (thePepper Commission).Mailing of notice of Medicare benefits and information describing theparticipating physician program.Prohibition of misuse of symbols, names, or emblems in reference to SocialSecurity or Medicare.Demonstration projects for chronic ventilator dependent units in hospitals.HMO provisions relating to adjustment of contracts and changes in civilmonetary penalties with respect to certain actions.Technical corrections to OBRA 1987.P.L. 101-234 also requires prepaid health plans, for calendar year 1990 only, toprovide the additional Part A and Part B benefits otherwise repealed. Theadjustments in the 1990 premium rates are retained to cover the costs of thesebenefits.MedicaidPL. 101-234 retained the Medicaid provisions of MCCA. These provisions areas follows:Requiring Medicaid to pay Medicare premiums and cost-sharing charges forMedicare beneficiaries below poverty.Spousalimpoverishmentprovisionwhich,inthecaseoftheinstitutionalization of one member of a couple, provides protection for a CRS-13 399 398 11387106 11-29-90 portion of the couple's income and resources for the maintenance needs of the community spouse.Requiring Medicaid coverage of pregnant women and infanta below poverty.In November 1989, GAO conducted a survey of the impact of repeal of MCCA's Medicare provisions on Mediceid budgets. The 37 States (and the District of Columbia) reporting data showed a total increase in 1990 budgets of $1 billion, of which an estimated $444 million would be State funds and $687 Federal funds.OBRA 1990During the second session of the 101st Congress, several measures were introduced to restore selected benefits which had been added by MCCA and subesquently mailed. Generally the benefits proposed for restoration were some of the less costly. OBRA 1990 restores two benefits which wore added by MCCA and removed under the repeal bill. Specifically,it provides coverage for biennial mammography screenings and provides that the 210 lifetime limit for hospice services may be extended. The law also accelerates implementation of a MCCA Medicaid provieion by requiring States to cover, by Jan. 1, 1991, all Medicare cost-sharing charges for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below poverty and meets below twice the figure applicable under the Supplemental Security Income (SSD program. It also adds a new provision requiring ail States, beginning Jan. 1, 1993, to cover Part B premium charges only for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 110% of poverty and sants below twice the SSI level.The second session of the 101st Congress also examined issues related to Medigap insurance. OBRA 1990 makes a number of modifications to the Msdigap requirements including the following:Simplification of Policies. Benefit options are to be simplified to provide for a core group of benefits, and up to a maximum of nine other groups of defined Medigap packages. The core group is to be common to ill Medigap benefit packages and mutt be offered by all Medigap insurers. The simplification standards may be waived in any state that has an alternative simplification program in effect on the date of enactment.Uniform Policy Description. To facilitate comparisons among policies, sellers of policies will be required to provide, before the sale of a policy, an outline of coverage which describes the policy's benefits using a standard form. In addition, policy benefits are to be described using uniform language,dermitions, and format.Prevention of Duplicate Medigap Coverage. Sellers of policies will berequired to obtain from the applicant a statement of what kind of insurancethe applicant has, the source of health insurance, and whether he or she is entitled to Medicaid. It will be unlawful to sell or issue a duplicate policy unless the applicant indicates that the policy replaces an misting one which will be terminated. CRS-14 399 1B87106 11-29-90 Renewability. Medigap policies must be guaranteed renewable. An issuer may cancel or nonrenew a policy only in the case of nonpayment of premiums or material misrepresentation.Medical Underwriting Limitations. Medigap insurers will be required to offer coverage to individuals, regardless of medical history, for a six-month period after the individual is first enrolled in Part B. Insurers are to be prohibited from discriminating in price for these policies based on the individuars medical or health status.Enforcement of Standards. No policy may be sold or issued unless the policy is sold or issued in a State with an approved regulatory program or is certified by the Secretary.Promulgation of Standards. If the NAIC promulgates standard's to implement the OBRA 1990 changes within 9 months of enactment, such standards will be applied in each State for policies to be approved. The standards will apply in the State no later than one year after promulgation by the NAIC.

However, inthe context of large Federal budget deficitsand increasing spending under existingentitlement programs, it is the issue of costthat provides the central focus of the long-term care debate. Federal and State Gov-ernments already are spending large sumson long-term careIn 1991, Federal andState spending 1or nursing home care --largely througl, the Medicaid program --was in excess .,f $32 billion; and additionalamounts were spent for home care.Despite these large public expendi-tures, the elderly face significant uncoveredliability for long-term care, and paying forthese services, especially nursing home care,can impoverish many of those needing care.The average cost of nursing home care is inexcess of $30,000 a year.Most nursinghome care is paid for by individuals out-of-pocket or by Medicaid. Medicaid's spendingfor nursing home care is driven by it- wv-erage of persons who have become poorafter depleting their resources and incomeon the cost of care. Private insurance forkng-term care is very limited at present.T1-.e result is that the only way people canpay privately for this care is with their ownaccumulated resources and/or income. Atthe same time, very little coverage, eitherthrough private insurance or public pro-grams, currently exists for the home andcommunity-based services the elderly andtheir families often prefer over institutionalcare.These financing problems are expectedto become more acute as a rapidly agingpopulation faces the need for long-termcare. An estimated 7.1 million elderly needlong-term care services. Of these, an esti-mated 5.6 million elderly, or almost 80% ofthe total, live in their own homes or othercommunity-based settings. About 1.5 mil-lion elderly reside in nursing homes. Esti-mates show that the number of elderlyneeding long-term care may grow from 7.1million to 13.8 million by 2030, with 5.3million elderly persons using nursing homecare and the remaining 8.5 million residingin the community.Proposals to expand public financing oflong-term care services beyond the coverageprovided by a means-tested program likeMedicaid can require a large additionalcommitment of funds.The prospect oflarge new costs had led to debate aboutwhat is the appropriate role for the publicand private sectors in financing expandedlong-term care coverage. Some believe thatthe Federal Government should assume themajor role in financing additional long-termcare services through a new entitlementprogram. Others believe that the costs ofany public sector expansion would be pro-hibitive and that the private sector throughprivate insurance should take the lead.Still others believe thatcombination ofpublic and private sector strategies is need-ed. Congress has not yet developed a con-sensus from these divergent viewpoints.Competing demands from other Federalprograms, the existence of Medicaid as asafety net program for those needing long-term care, the emergence of a private insur-ance market for long-term care, and uncer-tainty about the deoand for new benefitshave all served to deter major legislativeaction.President-elect Clinton has indicatedinterest in exploring, as part of his healthreform proposal, the possibility of includinghome care options under the Medicareprogram.Reprinted from Long-Term Care for the Elderly: Issue Brief, by Richard J. Priceand Carol O'Shaughnessy. W Ishington, Congressional Research Service,Updated Regularly. 11 p.Congressional Research Service The Library of Congress 4 )311MNIM 402 11393014 02-23-93BACKGROUND AND ANALYSISDefinitions and Need for Long-Term Care\"Long-term care' refers to a broad range of medical, social, personal care, andsupportive s^rvices needed by individuals who have lost some capacity for self-carebecause of a chronic illness or condition. Although chronic conditions occur in individuals of all ages, their incidence, especialy ea they result in disability, increaseswith age. These illnesses and conditions include heart disease, strokes, arthritis, visionand hearing impairments, and Alzheimer's and relatad dementias.The need for long-term care is often measured by assessing limitations in a person's capacity to manage certain functions or activities. For example, a chronic condition may result in dependence in certain functions that are basic for self-care, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, getting in or out of a bed or chair, or eating. These arereferred to as limitations in \"activities of daily living,\" or ADLs. Assistance with theseA.DLs may require hands-on assistance or direction, instruction, or supervision from another individual.Another set of limitations that reflect lower levels of disability are used to describedifficulties in performing household chores and social tasks. These are referred to as limitations in \"instrumental activitier of daily living,\" or TADLs, and include suchfunctions as meal preparation, cleaning, grorery shopping, managing money, and taking medicine.Limitations in ADLs and IADLs can vary in severity and prevalence. Persons can have limitations in any number of ADLs or IADLs, or both. An estimated 7.1 millionelderly persons need long-term care because of limitations in ADLs or IADLs. This is nearly one-quarter of the Nation's elderly population. Of the total, 3.3 million elderlypersons are estimated to be severely disabled, requiring assistance with at least threeADLs or substantial supervision due to cognitive impairment or other behavioral problems. The remaining 3.8 million are less severely disabled.Long-term care services are usually differentiated by the settings in which they are provided, with services provided either in nursing homes and other institutions or in home and community-based settings. The great majority of elderly needing long-termcare reside in the community. An estimated 5.6 million elderly, or almost 80% of thetotal 7.1 million elderly needing assistance with ADLe or IADLa, live in their own homes or other community-based settings. Only 1.5 million elderly persons reside in nursing homes.Paying for Long-Term Care ServicesThe way long-term care services are financed will remain of great interest to the103rd Congress.The table below indicates that the Nation spent $60 billion fornursing home ctre in 1991. Two auurces of payment -- the Medicaid program and out- of-pocket payments -- account for 90% of this total. This pattern of payment revealsthat the elderly face significant uncovered liability for long-term care and paying for these services can impoverish many of those needing care. CRS-1 4\u00b04 403 1B93014 02-23-93 Medicaid is the Federal-State health program for the poor. It limits coverage tothose people who are poor by welfare program standards or to those who have becomepoor as the result of incurring large medical expenses. Medicaid program data showthat spending for the elderly is driven largely by its coverage of people who havebecome poor as the result of depleting assets and income on the cost of nursing homecare. Many elderly people needing long-term care become eligible for Medicaid becauseof the high cost of nursing home care, currently averaging in excess of $30,000 per year.It is the impoverishing consequences of needing nursing home care that has ledpolicymakers over the years to try to look for alternative ways of financing this care.National Nursing Home Expenditures, bySource of Payment, 1991 (9 in billions) Total Nursing Home Care SpendingSource of spendingMedicaid $28.4Medicare 2.7Other Federal 1.1Other private 1.3Total59.9 Source:Health Care FinancingAdministration.Detail does not add tototal due to rounding.The table also indicates that nearly allprivate spending for nursing home care ispaid directly by consumers out-of-pocket.Private insurance coverage for long-termnursing home care is very limited, withprivate insurance payments amounting to1% of total spending for nursing homecare in 1991.(Private long-term careinsurance is discussed in additional detailbelow.) This pattern of private spendingfor nursing home care is also a drivingforce in the long-term care debate. Theonly way individuals have been able topay privately for expensive nursing homecareis with their own accumulatedresources and/or income.There nowexistsnocomprehensive,broadlyaffordable system for sharing the risk ofneeding nursing home care.By far the greatest portion of long-termcare spending is for nursing home care. Very little coverage, either through publicprograms or private insurance, exists for the ai...--r.-mtive home and community-basedservices that the elderly and their families prefer. In 1988 (the last year for whichestimates are available), total home care spending amounted to 18 to 24% of total long-term care spending. Spending figures do not take into account the substantial supportprovided to the elderly by family and friends. Studies have found that more than 70%of the functionally impaired elderly living in the community rely exclusively on unpaidsources, generally family and friends, for their care. Surveys have found that eight outof ten caregivers provide unpaid assistance averaging 4 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alarge proportion of caregivers are financially disadvantaged and one in three is inrelatively poor health.Caregiving frequently competes with the demands ofemployment and requires caregivers to reduce work hours, take time off without pay,or quit their jobs.The table also reveals that Medicare plays a very small role in financing long-termcare services.Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly anddisabled, is focused primarily on coverage of acute health care costs and was neverenvisioned as providing protection for long-term care. Coverage of nursing home care,for instance, is limited to short-term stays in certain kinds of nursing homes, referredto as skilled nursing facilities, and only for those people who demonstrate a need for CRS-2 404 IB93014 02-23-93daily skilled nursing care following a hospitalization.Many people who require long-terra nursing home care do not need daily skilled nursing care, and, therefore, do not qualify for Medicare's benefit. As a result of this restriction, Medicare paid for less than 4.5% of the Nation's expenditures for nursing home care in 1991.For similar reasons, Medicare pays for only limited amounts of community-based long-term care services, primarily through the program's home health benefit. To qualify for home health services, the person must be in need of skilled nuraing care on an intermittent basis, or physical or speech therapy. Most chronically impaired people do not need skilled care to remain in their homes, but rather nonmedical supportive care and assistance with basic self-care functions and daily routines that do not require skilled personnel.Three other Federal programs the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), the Older Americans Act, and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programprovide support for community-based long-term care services for impaired elderly people. The SSBG provides block grants to States for a variety of home-based services for the elderly, as well as the disabled and children. The Older Americans Act also funds a broad range of in-home services for the elderly. Under the SSI program, the federally administered income assistance program for aged, blind, and disabled people, many States provide supplemental payments to the basic SSI payment to support selected community-based long-term care services for certain eligible people, including the frail elderly. However, since funding available for thege three programs is limited, their ability to address the financing problems in long term care is also limited.In addition to these Federal programs, a number of States devote significant State funds to home and community- based long-term care services.Long-term care financing issues are expected to become more pressing in years to come, given current demographic trends and projections of utilization of long-term care service.. Estimates show that the number of elderly needing long-term care may grow from 7.1 million to 13.8 million by 2o0, with 5.3 million elderly persons using nursing home care in that year and the remaining 8.5 million residing in the community.Major Themes of ReformConcern about long-term care financing is not new. Creation of Federal task forces on long-term care issues, as well as Federal investment in research and demonstration efforts to identify cost-effective \"alternatives to institutional care,\" date back to the late 1960s and early 1970s when payments for nursing home care began consuming a growing proportion of Medicaid expenditures. The awareness that public programs provided only limited support for community-based care, as well as concern about the fragmentation and lack of coordination in Federal support for long-term care, led to the development of a number of legislative proposals beginning in the mid-1970s. Over the years, bills have variously proposed (1) establishing in Medicare new comprehensive long-term care benefits; (2) consolidating certain existing benefits of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SSBG programs into a new program of Federal support for long-term care with uniform benefits and eligibility; and (3) providing block grants to the States for expanded home and community-based care. 4'1;CRS-3 405 1B93014 02-23-93 While a number of proposals to provide for large scale reform have been considered by Congress over the years, long-term care legislation thus far enacted has taken an incremental approach, principally through limited expansion of existing program support for home and community-based services. Congress has proceeded cautiously in expanding community-based care for a number of reasons. Federal long-term caredemonstrations have generally shown that expanded community-based services represent new costs that are not offset by reductions in nursing home spending. In addition, policymakers are concerned about the unpredictability of the demand for community-based care, given the current lack of financing for these services and resulting inadequate information about how people would use services if they were broadly covered under a public program.Incremental changes enacted into law have included 1981 legislation authorizing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to allow States to broaden coverage for a range of community-baaed long-term care services under their Medicaid plans (known as home and community-based waiver programs). In 1982, Congress also established a new Medicare hospice benefit that provides broad home care coverage to terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries. In 1987, Congress gave States limited new authority to provide in-home services for the frail elderly under the Older Americans Act. Most recently, OBRA 90 included provisions that establish in Medicaid a new optional benefit for home and community-based services for the frail elderly, with spending capped at a total of $580 million for five years.Current Legislative IssuesIn the context of large Federal budget deficits and increasing spending under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, it is the issue of cost, above all, that has provided the central focus of the long-term care debate. Federal and State Governments already are spending large sums on long-term care. In 1991, Federal and State spending for nursing home carelargely through the Medicaid program was in excess of $32 billion; and additional amounts were spent for home care. Proposals to expand public financing of long-term care services beyond the coverage provided by a means-tested program like Medicaid can require a large additional commitment of funds. The prospect of large new costs had led to debate, as yet unresolved, about what is the appropriate role for the public and private sectors in financing expanded long-term care coverage.Public and Private Sector StrategiesPolicymakers differ in their views about what public and private sector responsibilities should be in financing long-term care. These views have been reflected in a broad spectrum of bills that been introduced in recent Congresaes. The 103rd Congress is likely to see similar approaches embodied in legislation introduced this year.Those advocating a public sector solution argue that all persons at one time or another are at risk of needing long-term care, and this risk can be most efficiently shared by a social insuranceprogram like Medicare that provides coverage to all personspaying a payroll tax during their working years. Public sector advocates also argue that the need for long-term care is no different from the need for medical care; the elderly CRS-4 406 1E93014 02-23-93 are not expected to impoverish themselves when they need medical care and should notbe expected to do so when they need long-term care.Private sector advocates, on the other hand, argue that the country cannot affordthe tax burden asuciated with another entitlement program like Medicare. They alsoargue that, since many elderly persons need long-term care at the end of their lives, anew public entitlement that is not means-tested like Medicaid could have the effect ofusing scarce public resources to protect assets for younger generations. Thoseadvocating private sector solutions focus on private long-term care insurance as themost promising option for providing greater coverage for nursing home and home care.They propose a variety of tax incentives to individuals and employers for the purchaseof this insurance so as to encourage the growth of this relatively new market and tohelp reduce the high premium costs of policies that most elderly persons cannot nowafford.Still others advocate a partnership between the public sector and privateinsurance. These persons suggest that the cost of long-term care must be shared byboth if a solution is to be found. A broad range of public-private insurance partnerships have been proposed that would establish a larger or smaller role forprivate insurance, depending on the role that the public sector would play in theparticular proposal. Proposals have ranged from partnerships where private insurancewould be limited to paying for cost-sharing charges not covered by comprehensive publicbenefits to others where private insurance would provide the bue of coverage andpurchase of qualified policies would be subsidized for those persons with low tomoderate income.Congress Ism not yet developed a consensus from these divergent viewpoints.Competing demands from other Federal programs, the existence of Medicaid as a safety-net program that provides access to long-term care services, an emerging privateinsurance market, and the prospect of high costa and new taxes to finance new long-term care benefits have all served to deter major legislative action.Private Long-Term Care InsuranceLong-term care insurance is a relatively new, but rapidly growing, market. In1986, approximately 30 insurers were selling long-term care insurance policies of sometype and an estimated 200,000 people were covered by these policies. By 1987, a DHHSTask Force un Long-Term Care Insurance found 73 companies writing long-term careinsurance policies covering 423,000 people. As of December 1991, the Health InsuranceAssociation of America (HIAA) found that more than 2.4 million policies had been sold,with 135 insurers offering coverage.Although growth has been considerable in a short period of time, the privateinsurance industry has approached this potential market with caution. Insurers areconcerned about the potential for adverse selection for this; product, where only thosepeople who are likely to need care actually buy insurance. In addition, they point tothe problem of induced demand for services that can be expected to be generated by theavailability of new long-term care insurance. With induced demand, individuals decideto use more services than they otherwise would because they have insurance and/or willshift from nonpaid to paid providers for their care. In addition, insurers are concernedthat, given the nature of many chroLic conditions, people who need long-term care will CRS-5 4 !S 401 IB93014 02-23-93 need it for the remainder of their lives, resulting in an open-ended liability foe theinsurance company.As a result of these risks, insurers have designed policies that limit their liabilityfor paying claims. Policies are medically underwritten to exclude persons with certainconditions or illnesses. They contain benefit restrictions that limit access to coveredcare. Policies also limit the period of coverage they offer, typically to a maximum offour or five years. In addition, most plans provide indemnity benefits that pay only afixed amount for each day of covered service. If these amounts are not updated forinflation, the protection offered by the policy can be significantly eroded by the time aperson actually needs care. Today policies generally offer some form of inflationadjustment, but only with significant increases in premium costs.These design features of long-term care insurance raise issues about the qualityof coverage offered purchasers of policies. The insurance industry has responded tosome of these concerns by offering new products that provide broadened coverage andfewer restrictions. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners(NAIC) has established standards for regulating long-term care insurance that manyStates have adopted at least some portion of for regulation of these products in theirjurisdictions.However, policymakers remain concerned about the need for consistent anduniform standards for coverage. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has reportedthat, while NAIC standards for long-term care insurance have been amended annuallyand have improved significantly during the past 5 years, States have lagged in adoptingthe revised standards. GAO also noted that, although NAIC standards provide afoundation for consumer protection, problems remain, including restrictive definitionsthat limit access to benefits and lack of protection against loss of financial investmentin a policy. Bills have been introduced in the 103rd Congress to require long-term careinsurance policies to meet certain minimum standards established under Stateregulatory programs, or in the absence of State action, by the Secretary of HHS. Thesebills include H.R. 132, H.R. 438, and S. 203.One of the key issues outstanding in the debate on the role private insurance canplay in financing long-term care is the affordability of coverage. HIAA has reported onthe premium costs of policies providing good coverage in December 1991. These policiespaid $80 a day for nursing home care and $40 a day for home health care; they hadlifetime 5% compounded inflation protection, a 20-day deductible period, and a four-yearmaximum coverage period. These policies had an average annual premium in December1991 of $1,781 when purchased at the age of 65 and $5,627 when purchased at the ageof 79. Many elderly people cannot afford these premiums.The insurance industry bet.i.wee that affordability of premiums can be greatlyenhanced if the pool of those to whom policies are sold is expanded. The industry hasargued that the greatest potential for expanding the pool and reducing premiums lieswith employer-based group coverage. Premiums should be lower in employer-bandgroup coverage because younger age groups with lower levels of risk of needinglong-term care would be included, allowing insurance companies to build up reservesto cover future payments of benefits. In addition, group coverage has loweradministrative expenses. CRS-6 4'19 408 I893014 02-23-93According to DIAA, 288 employers offered a long-term care insurance plan to their employees, as of December 1991. These employer-based plans covered over 200,000 employees, their spouses, retirees, parents, and parents-in-law.But just how broad-based employer interest is in a new long-term care benefit is unclear. Many employers currently face large unfunded liabilities for retiree pension and health benefits. Also,many employers have recently experienced fairly substantial increases in premiums for their current health benefits plans. Very few employers make contributions to the premium cost of a long-term care plan. Almost all employers require that the employeepay the full premium cost ofcoverage. In contrast, the majority of medium and large size employers pay the full premium cost of regular health care benefits for their employees.One other suggestion has been offered for increasing the affordability and appeal of long-terro care insurance. Various States have been exploring an option for encouraging people to purchase insurame coverage according to the level of gussets they wish to protect. Under this approach, States would extend to people buying policies the protection of Medicaid without requiring them to deplete assets as theyare required to do now. Instead, people would be able to protect assets according to the amount of long-term care insurance they purchased and obtain Medicaid coverage for care they needed after their private policies had ceased providingcoverage.Four States (California, Connecticut, Indiana, and New York) have received DIMS approval to operate such programs. What impact this approach will have on the premium costs and marketability of private insurance for long-term care is unclear.Services, Eligibility, Management, and FinancingFor those bills proposingnew publicly funded or subsidized long-term care benefits, another set of issues must be resolved. These include: what services should be covered; what eligibility criteria should be used for determining who should receive benefits and how care for beneficiaries should be managed; what respective roles the Federal and State governments should play in the organization andmanagement of the program; what provider reimbarsement strategies should be used; and what financing mechanisms should be used.Covered Services. Services that are generally considered critical services for chronically impaired elderly people to remain in their homes are nonmedical support services, such as homemaker/home health aide services, personal care, adult day care, and services that temporarily relieve family caregivers of their responsibilities (generally referred to as respite care). AR recently considered bills proposingnew publicly funded long-term care benefits are similar in the comprehensive coverage they would provide for home care. They doso because Federal programs currently provide relatively little support for home care, and these are the services most people prefer.With regard to nursing home coverage, on the other hand, recent proposals have taken at least two distinct approaches. Certain proposals would provide comprehensive Federal coverage for the first months of a nursing home stay, for example, for the first 3 or 6 months ofa stay.These pro?osals provide what is known as 'front-end\" coverage. Their emphasis is on providi ag comprehensive coverage for people during the first months of their stayso that ar.er they return to the community their resources 4 thCRS-7 409 1B93014 02-23-93 are intact. Those people with longer stays would use private funds or private insuranceto pay for additional costs not covered by the public program.Other proposals have been designed to offer more comprehensive Federal nursinghome coverage than the previous approach. They would provide Federal coveragefollowing a short stay of two or three months in a nursing home, with cost-sharingafter benefits began. Private insurance could cover these costs.This variation in approaches reflects, in part, the concern of certain policymakersthat expanded nursing home coverage for long stays may end up protecting assets forsome nursing home residents who are never likely to return to the community. Theeffect of the expanded coverage, financed with public dollars, may be to protect assetsof the elderly for children or other relatives to inherit.Eligibility. Bills proposing publicly financed benefits have based eligibility forlong-term care benefits on a person's inability to perform ADLs, including the functionsof bathing, dressing, getting in or out of a bed or chair, or eating. Using ADLs allowslong-term care benefits to be targeted to a limited number of people, and also enablesthe new benefit to be provided without regard to certain medical criteria commonly usedto establish eligibility for health benefits. Eligibility criteria for health benefits, suchas prior hospitalization or need for skilled nursing care, often have little to do with thesocial service needs of a chronically impaired population and can limit access to servicesneeded by a long-term care population. Proposals have generally used two or threelimitations in ADLa as a threshold for eligibility, the higher number limiting eligibilityto a more disabled population and covering fewer people. (As noted above, an estimated3.3 million elderly require assistance with three or more ADLs.)Recently considered bills have also based eligibility on the existence of cognitiveimpairments. Many people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease may becognitively impaired, and may not have limitations in ADD:4 but require supervision tocarry out these functions.While surveys have estimated numbers of elderly with ADL limitations, thenumber of persons who would actually try to establish eligibility for new publiclyfinanced benefits cannot be determined with any certainty. There is very little data onuse of long-term care services in an insured environment. The great majority of elderlyrely on family and friends to provide assistance with their needs. While studies haveshown that families do not withdraw their support when expanded home andcommunity-based care is provided under federally sponsored demonstration projects,information does not exist to show what demand for services would be when a programpermanently establishes new publicly financed long-term care benefits. This lack ofcertainty about demand for care and resulting costs of new publicly funded benefitshave served to postpone any major action on long-term care.Role of the States.State governments have substantial responsibility forlong-term care. Not only do States administer home and community-based servicesauthorized under the Medicaid, SSBG, and Older Americans Act programs, they alsohave responsibility for implementation and oversight of Federal standards governingnursing homes and home health care agencies receiving reimbursement under theMedicaid and Medicare programs. Over the past 10-15 years, some States have mademajor strides in dealing with the complexities involved in coordinating the various CRS-8 411 410 1E93014 02-23-93 Federal home and community-based long-term care programs to overcome what theybelieve is a bias in Federal funding for institutional care.State initiatives have included development of methods to control access toinstitutions through preadmission screening mechanisms; development of casemanagement systems to authorize and control use of community-based services(sometimes through designation of local agencies to act as single entry points forlong-term care services); and consolidation of State administration of the variouslong-term care services programs. In addition, some States have spent substantial Statedollars to support home and community-based long-term care services to be responsiveto the strong preference of the elderly for such care.Some observers point out that a State role in the administration of an expandedpublicly funded long-term care program may compromise a uniform national benefit,with the possibility of inconsistency in States' interpretations of Federal policies. Otheranalysts and State officials argue that States already have experience in coordinatingand administering nonmedical long-term care benefits and are also in a good positionto oversee the multiplicity of local providers that would be involved in providing long-term care.Enacted legislation that has incrementally expanded nonmedical home andcommunity-based services, such as the Medicaid waiver programs and the OlderAmericans Act, has built upon existing State roles. Recently considered proposals haveprovided for a major role for the States in administering new benefits, and it is likelythat similar proposals will be considered by the 103rd Congress.Role of Case Management. Case management generally refers to ways ofmatching services to an individual's needs. In the context of long-term care, casemanagement generally includes the following components: screening and assessmentto determine an individual's eligibility and need for a given service or program;development of a plan of care specifying the types and amounts of care to be provided;authorization and arrangement for delivery of services; and monitoring andreassessment of the need for services on a periodic basis.Some State and local agencies have incorporated case management as a basic partof their long-term care systems development. The availability of Medicaid funds underthe home and community-based waiver programs has spurred the development of casemanagement services; but, other sources of funds have been used by States to developcase management ayatems, including State-only funds, SSBG, and the Older AmericansAct.Case management is carried out in a wide variety of ways. Organizational arrangements may range from centralized systems to those in which some casemanagement functions are conducted by different agencies. Case management may beprovided by many community organizations, including home health agencies, areaagencies on aging, and other social service or health agencies. In some cases wherestatewide long-term care systems have been developed, one agency at the communitylevel has been designated to perform case management functions, thereby establishinga single point of access to long-term care services. CRS-9 412 411 1B93014 02-23-93 While there seems to be a certain degree of consensus as to the promise casemanagement offers as a means to control utilization of long-term care services as wellas to coordinate services, there is not yet agreement as to the most effective way toincorporate case management functions into expanded long-term care benefits.Proposals have designated a number of different agencies to carry out some or all of thecase-management functions.Reimbursement. The way long-term care services are reimbursed will have asignificant impact on expenditures under any new program, Medicare currentlyreimburses covered home health and nursing home services on the basis of reasonablecosts (defined by the program) that have actually been incurred for care provided toprogram beneficiaries, up to specified limits. This method has been criticized on anumber of grounds, including its lack of incentives for providers to maximize efficiencyand minimize costs. Most States use, at least in part, a prospective payment methodfor reimbursing nursing home care under their Medicaid programs. Prospectivepayment reimbursement establishes, in advance of the time when services are provided,payment rates for care on a per visit, per case, per month, or other basis. Many long-term care proposals have required that reimbursement for community and/or nursinghome care be based on annual budgets, fee schedules, or some other prospectivelydetermined reimbursement mechanism, established by the Secretary.Various Federal long-term care demonstrations have attempted to controlpayments for expanded home and community-based care by establishing caps onamounts that can be spent for services. Generally these have been linked to averageMedicaid payments for nursing home care in the State, on the assumption thatexpanded services will serve as a substitute for institutional care and should cost less.The National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration, for example, required thataverage per client expenditures for expanded community-based care not exceed 60% ofthe average of the State's Medicaid rates for nursing homes in the demonstration area.Proposals have generally used some variation of this cap concept.Financing. Bills proposing new publicly funded long-term care benefits recognizethat new revenues would be required to finance these benefits. These new revenues arenot insignificant, given the costs of proposals covering both nursing home and homecare benefits.Certain bills providing coverage for nursing home and home careintroduced in the 102nd Congress had estimated new Federal costs of $45-60 billion inthe first full year of implementation. To finance new expenditures, bills variouslypropose increases in individual and corporate income taxes, increases in payroll taxes,including elimination of the cap on income subject to the Medicare payroll tax, increasesin cigarette and alcohol taxes, and new estate taxes (on the grounds that expandedlong-term care coverage under a public program protects assets that would be inheritedby children or others). Bills that propose to provide tax incentives for the purchase ofprivate insurance for long-term care also require new Federal expenditures, specificallytax expenditures that represent revenues lost to the Treasury. It is the tax burdenassociated with new long-term care benefits that has discouraged Congress from actionin this area. 413 64-300 09314 412 1893014 02-23-93 LEGISLATIONHR. 132 (Collin.)Long-Term Care Standards and Consumer Protection Act of 1993.Establishesnew Title XXI in t.he Social Security Act to require long-term careinsurance policies to meet minimum standards specified in State regulatory programsapproved by the Secretary of IIHS.

In particular, containing the burgeoningtotal costs of LTC that are anticipated under current policies conflictswith providing better protection for LTC users against the out-of-pocket costs of this care, broadening the range of services available,and improving their quality.Total LTC expenditures, and the amount that federal taxpayersfund under current law, are projected to rise rapidly because of the ag-ing of the baby-boom generation, imprcvements in life expectancy, andrates of price increase for LTC services that exceed general inflation.Although medical research may be able to reduce future care require-ments by finding ways to prevent the need for care, the policy dilemmawill remain.Some observers--\"fiscal critics\" of the present system--considerthat both the level and expected growth rate of federal LTC costs areunacceptably high and that the private sector should therefore play alarger role in financing LTC services. Other observers--\"performancecritics\" of the present system--consider that the system provides toolittle financial protection for people who need extended and, in manycases, very costly LTC services. They also want a broader range andhigher quality of services to be available. Yet policy changes Viatwould expand access to services and reduce the financial burden on in-dividuals requiring them would in general increase total expenditures.Most changes would also raise federal outlaysperhaps by billions ofdollars annually--beyond the increases projected under current law. BACKGROUNDLong-term care services are rehabilitative, medical, and supportivesocial services of various kinds for people who have functional limita-Reprinted from Policy Choices for Long-Term Care. Washington, CongressionalBudget Office, 1991. p. ix-xxii. 415 414 a POLICY CHOICES FOR WNG-TERM CARE JIM; tions or chronic health conditions and who need ongoing health care orassistance with normal activities of daily living. These services in-clude nursing home care and a range of home- and community-based(H&CB) services.Although most people who need LTC receive it in the form ofunpaid care from family members and friends, paid services are a bigbusiness that amounted to nearly $58 billion in fiscal year 1988 (seeSummary Table 1). As the baby-boom generation ages, the LTC busi-ness will grow (see Summary Figure 1 for projected use of the principaltorm of care). Governments already pay half the total cost, mainlythrough the Medicaid program, and face the prospect of rapid growthin spending under current policy. Moreover, the prospects for avoidingthe projected increases in federal outlays are bleak because the mosteffective mechanisms for doing so are already in place: individuals are now required to exhaust most of their own resources before receivingpublicly subsidized care, the range of subsidized services is narrowlydefined, and the states are already required to share in the costs of theMedicaid programs that they administer.Complicating the challenge for policymakers is that the nature ofthe alleged problem of access to services in the current system isunclear. Despite anecdotal accounts of shortcomings in available LTC,there is little reliable quantitative evidence from nationwide studiesshowing that significant numbers of people fail to receive neededassistance. This dearth of evidence could imply that no real problemwith shortages of LTC or unmet needs for LIC exists; it might, on theother hand, simply reflect a lack of consensus on what constitutes a \"shortage\" or on what is \"needed\" or \"adequate\" care. Finally, con- cerns about access might be of a quite different kind--reflecting, for in-stance, dissatisfaction with the financial terms on which access is cur-rently available, or subjective evaluations of the scale, appropriate-ness, quality, or flexibility of care under the present system. Regard-less of the nature of the access problem, however, a clear trade-offexists between modifying the LTC system to reduce individuals'financial vulnerability and the public and private costs of doing so. 4 415 SUMMARY xl SUMMARY TABLE 1.

ISSUESLong-term care policy might have several goals. It codd aim to:oEnsure that services are available, whether or not the people needing them can pay for them;oEnsure that these services are of satisfactory quality; OProtect individuals needing services against their potentiallycatastrophic costs; and 417 SUMMARY iiii oAvoid unnecessary federal outlays and contain their aggre- gate level.People disagree, however, about the priority of these goals relative to other urgent fiscal concerns--not the least of which is reducing thefederal deficit--and relative to one another. What weight, for example,should be given to the goal of providing financial protection againstLTC costs? The Medicaid program is designed to address the goal of making LTC services available, but generally provides little protectionfor people's own resources because they remain ineligible until theyhave spent all but defined amounts of their resources on care. Issues Relating to Financial Protection for IndividualsPolicymakers who wished to extend financial protection against thecatastrophic costs of LTC would need to make four sets of choices in de- signing policies to do so. These choices concern the mechanism for pro- viding financial protection, the range of services to be covered, the specific groups to be targeted for public assistance, and the division of responsibility between the public and private sectors and among the levels of government.Selecting a Mechanism for Providing Financial Protection. The first choice would be to decide among alternative methods for providingprotection against the high costs of LTC. Possible mechanisms include encouraging greater personal saving, establishing risk-pooling ar- rangements, providing subsidies that would be related to people's re- sources, or combining these strategies.oIncentives to sa%e are intended to augment personal re- sources and so to promote self-sufficiency in purchasingneeded LTC services. These incentives, though, appear more likely to increase the net cost of LTC to the public sector than to reduce it.oRisk-pooling arrangements would involve generally avail-able insurance or prepaid care mechanisms through which nonusers and users of services at all income and asset levels 4 9 418 slyPOUCY CHOICES FOR ZANG-TERM CARE Ju e 111111 1 could share the financia! risks associated with LTC use. Un-regulated private markets for LTC insurance, however, ap-pear subject to market failure in ways that result in too littlecoverage. oResource-related subsidies, if used alone, would make LTCservices available at subsidized prices for people with limitedresources. A policy on user charges would specify how pricesubsidies wol. '4 relate to the number of services used, thecost of each service, and the individual's level of privatelyavailable resources. The subsidies, however, would normallybe financed by taxpayers. oThese three strategies could also be combined in variousways. In particular, combining risk-pooling arrangementswith resource-related subsidies would create the option ofsubsidizing the participation of low-income people in any risk-pooling arrangements established for LTC. Subsidiesfor risk-pooling arrangements would also be borne by tax-payers.Selecting the Services to be Covered The second choice relates to the range of services for which financial protection would be offered. Atissue are questions of balance within the overall mix of LTC services:balance between residential and nonresidential forms of care--for ex- ample, whether financial protection would be provided against thecosts of all LTC services, or only nursing home care; balance withinresidential forms of care among nursing homes and other types offacilities that offer supportive or therapeutic care in a less restrictivesetting; and balance within nonresidential forms of care among vari- ous in-home and community-based services.Concerning the balance between residential and nonresidentialforms of care, the critical policy question is the extent to which societyis prepared to offer financial protection against the costs of H&CB care that may increase the quality of life for frail and functionally de-pendent people and their unpaid caregivers. This question is crucialbecause the evidence suggests thtt expanding conventional H&CB 4 4: o 419 SUMMARY XV programs would not reduce aggregate public LTC expenditures andcould increase them considerably.Targeting Assistance. The third choice concerns the specific groups toward whom public funds would be targeted if limitations on fundingmade such targeting the preferred approach. The possible criteria fordefining target groups include age, duration of the need for services,the level of functional limitations, and the level of private resources available to LTC recipients or their families.Assigning Responsibilities Within the LTC System. The fourth choiceconcerns how to divide responsibility within the LTC system amongthe private sector, state and local governments, and the federal gov- ernment. Relevant areas of responsibility include determining the fea-tures of the LTC system, administering the system, and financing thepaid care that is provided. Issues Relating to Total and Federal CostsVirtually any LTC policy changes that would reduce financial vul-nerability could be expected to increase total expenditures for LTCThey could also be expected to increase either federal outlays for LTCor the federal revenue losses associated with tax preferences for pri-vate LTC expenditures.Policy changes to improve financial protection under voluntary ar- rangements would need either to increase the private resources avail-able to purchase LTC services or to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of using services (which is the effective price of these services). Measuresthat would increase private resources--for example, tax incentives for private saving dedicated to LTC services--would probably reduce fed-eral revenue by more than they would reduce Medicaid outlays. Mea- sures that would reduce the out-of-pocket .cost of using services wouldlead people to change--and in many cases to raise--the amounts, kinds, and quality of services they used in ways that would increase overall costs. 4 ? 1 420 iviPOLICY CHOICES FOR LONG-TERM CARE Julie UM Increased private resources and lower effective prices for serviceswould each increase use. If the supply of LTC services expanded lessquickly, at least in the short run, then their prices would rise as well.Both effects would directly increase total costs and governmental costs.In addition, there could be indirect effects on costs. Attitudes towardthe acceptability of paid LTC services might change, further increas-ing their use and cost, although the magnitude of these behavioralchanges is unpredictable. Moreover, if accepted standards of care alsorose, Medicaid would be expected to meet them, thereby indirectly in-creasing federal and state expenditures.Proposals to improve financial protection need not expand therelative role of the federal government, however, although the ab-solute level of federal outlays or revenue losses would probably rise.For example, the federal government could continue to share programcosts with the states in the same proportions as at present.Historically, it appears that most growth in Medicaid's real spend-ing on nursing home care has reflected growth in the number of days ofnursing home care for which Medicaid paid rather than real growth inthe cost of a day of care. In turn, growth in the number of nursinghome days of care for which Medicaid paid appears to have resultedmore from growth in days of care per recipient than from growth in thenumber of recipients. OPTIONSTwo broad approaches to modifying the LTC system are possible. Oneapproach would retain both the current division of responsibility forLTC and Medicaid's basic character as an income-tested and asset-tested program. It would address specific problems in the design of theMedicaid program through changes that could be implemented incre-mentally, depending on priorities and the availability of funds. Theother broad approach would more fundamentally restructure the sys-tems for financing and delivering long-term care. In the process, itwould substantially modify the division of responsibility for that care. 4 421 SUMMARY viaNumerous options are available under each approach. The Sum- mary Box classifies many of these options by the extent and type of changes they would make in responsibilities within the LTC system. Incremental OptionsFive illustrative options for changes in Medicaid would address vari- ous goals of LTC policy. Two of the options would increase both theavailability of services and financial protection against their costs by establishing medically needy programs in all states and by broadening the availability of H&CB services for severely dependent people. Two additional options are designed to help contain net public outlays for LTC. One would tighten estate-recovery processes. The other would incorporate two approaches, whose effectiveness in containing pro- gram costs has been asserted but remains unproven. This option wouldregulate growth in the number of nursing home beds eligible for fed- eral funding and extend the requirement for preadmission screening to a wider group of nursing home applicants. The remaining option couldmake a modest contribution to enhancing the quality of life for resi- dents in nursing homes by raising and indexing the personal needs allowance, which enables Medicaid-eligible nursing home residents to make limited personal purchases.Overall, these illustrative options could provide increased finan- cial protection for a broaderrange of services, could make this pro- tection more uniform across the states, and might increase the quality of life for some people needing LTC services. They would do so, how- ever, at additional cost to taxpayers, and they would in some respects restrict the freedom of states to experiment and to determine the scope and structure of Medicaid in light of local conditions and values. They would also include features designed to contain costs that might prove ineffective or inimical to promoting both access and quality. 422 xviii POLICY CHOICES FOR LONG-TERM CARE Jane HMI SUMMARY BOXIllustrative Polley Options for Long-Term CareImplement Incremental Changes Within MedicaidoMandate medically needy programs for LTC services.oExpand the availability of home- and community-based services for severe- ly dependent people.oTighten estate-recovery processes and rules.oMandate state regulation of growth in the number of nursing home beds andpreadmission screening for additional nursing home applicantsoRaise and index the personal needs allowance.

In essence, thesestrategies would expand the roles of the private sector, of the states,and of the federal government, respectively.Expand the Role of the Private Sector. One strategy would providepublic subsidies or regulatory support for participation in LTC fi-nancing arrangements that are under private auspices. This strategywould make greater use of the private sector--in providing or chan-neling funds to pay for services supplied by private organizations--butit would not necessarily reduce taxpayers' costs and could increasethem. It could include subsidizing either private LTC insurance or pri-vate saving for LTC, while retaining a residual welfare program forpeople unable to secure needed care because they were poor or were de-nied insurance coverage on health grounds.A refundable income tax credit for private LTC insurance, for ex-ample, would represent a flexible policy option that could substantiallyincrease financial protection for those purchasing coverage and thatmight appreciably reduce Medicaid costs in the long run, although notnecessarily by more than it would reduce tax revenues. Subsidizingprivate insurance for individuals, however, would not assist peoplewith preexisting conditions that imply a current or future need forLTC, and it could require considerable regulation of the LTC insuranceindustry (which has yet to demonstrate either long-term commercialviability or large-scale consumer appeal). Moreover, the level of publicsubsidies--and hence of public expenditures--that would be required toachieve widespread insurance coverage under the option would almostcertainly be large but cannot be quantified precisely.Another option would require employers to arrange coverage formost employees and their family members under a community-rated,group LTC insurance policy with a standard package of vested, pre-funded, indexed benefits that could be preserved by people leaving em-ployment. Employees could be required to pay premiums from after-tax income with no public subsidy, or employees' premium payments 4 5 424 ix POLICY CHOICES FOR LONG-TERM CARE Jima HMI could qualify for a refundable income tax credit as in the previousoption, or any employer contributions could receive a degree of taxpreference similar to that for employer pension contributions. Thisoption could progressively establish widespread LTC insurance cov-erage. Because premiums would be community-rated, no one could bedenied coverage because of preexisting conditions. Coverage would beachieved, however, by compelling LTC insurers to offer such coverage,employers to sponsor it, and employees to purchase it. Also, the federalgovernment might in practice become the reinsurer of last resort,assuming ultimate financial liability if the insurance arrangementscollapsed.The illustrative option to promote saving for LTC, which can alsobe thought of as self-insurance, would make it easier for people toaccumulate contingent assets (those that become available to theirowners in defined circumstances). The option would change the taxtreatment of retirement income and insurance plans to permit com-bined insurance against the needs for retirement income, LTC, andincome for survivors. It would thus integrate private saving for LTCwith the broader system of private saving for retirement income sup-port.Cash benefits in the integrated system would then reflecthealth-induced variations in financial need among retirees. Providingbenefits in cash, however, might lead to increased demand, more rapidgrowth in LTC prices, and cash payment for care that is currently un-paid. Moreover, information on which to base the levels of benefits andpremiums in an integrated system is quite limited.Expand the Role of the States. A second strategy would involveproviding LTC block grants to the states in place of current federalLTC funding under Medicaid, Medicare, and portions of the OlderAmericans Act and the Social Services Block Grant. To qualify for thegrants, state LTC programs would need to satisfy certain federal con-ditions. This option is compatible with a broad range of levels of fed-eral financial commitment and policy responsibility for LTC. Federalfunding under this option could vary from its present level, indexedonly for inflation, to levels determined by a formula that could reflectthe age structure of a state's populationfor example, by incorporatingprogressively higher capitation rates for successively older cohortsaswell as the state's average per capita income. Similarly, conditions of 4 26 425 SUMMARY :xi the grant could vary from a mere requirement that states maintaintheir current inflation-adjusted funding levels for LTC to extensiveprovisions that would specify the minimum scope of coverage or re-quirements for LTC delivery systems.This strategy would impose a predictable ceiling on federal outlaysfor LTC and would permit real growth in these outlays to be containedas desired. Some options under this strategy could dramatically lowerfederal costs compared with current law, but in doing so they wouldeither transfer these costs to the states at a time when the populationrequiring LTC is expected to balloon or increase the costs being borneby those using LTC services and their families. Other options thatinvolved higher levels of federal funding would enable the federalgovernment to limit its outlays but retain significant influence overLTC policy. States might fear, however, that the federal financial com-mitment would be reduced after they had accepted greater financial,policy, and administrative responsibility for future systems of LTC.Expand the Role of the Federal Government. A third strategy wouldinvolve a new social insurance program that would provide a legis-latively based entitlement to defined LTC services for individuals as-sessed as having specified functional limitations. The most compre-hensive option under this strategy would provide a full range of neededservices to all people qualifying for the entitlement. Other optionswould adopt differing criteria to limit the scope of coverage and thusthe implied increase in federal LTC costs. These criteria could limitcoverage based on the duration of care (for example, covering only the\"front end\" or \"back end\" of care), the asset level of the care recipient(for example, covering only people with assets below the median level),or the type of care required (for example, covering only nursing homecare).By creating a new social insurance program, this strategy wouldspread the financial risks associated with the use of covered LTCacross the whole population and would thereby provide a high degreeof financial protection against the tosts of this care. This approachwould integrate not only the financing of LTC, but possibly also itsdelivery, and would provide all eligible people throughout the countrywith a similar opportunity to receive neeled care. 427 426 sitih POUCY CHOICES FOR LONG.TERM CARE Jame HMI The major drawback is that total federal LTC outlays would bemuch higher than under current law: more people needing LTC wouldqualify for assistance; a larger share of the services they receivedwould be federally financed; people would seek more services than ifthey were paying fully for the care themselves; and the increase indemand could raise the unit price of LTC services. Moreover, assess-ment processes that were developed for research and clinical purposes,rather than as administrative criteria for determining an entitlementto benefits, would have a primary role in determining not only eachindividual's entitlement but also total spending on the program.People needing costly LTC services might characterize their problemsmore seriously to assessors who controlled access to the desired ser-vices. As a result, the number of people assessed as eligible for servicesunder the entitlement could increase to an unknown degree. Conse-quently, public-sector costs under this strategy--especially for H&CF1carewould not only be high but would also be subject to significantuncerta inty. 4 ?
