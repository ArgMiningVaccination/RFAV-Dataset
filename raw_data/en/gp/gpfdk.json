There are currently three versions of B1617, which also include B16172 and B16173. B16173 is considered rare so far. However, B16172 is quite prevalent in infected individuals globally. How infectious is this new strain? According to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, the B1617 mutations is one and a half to two times more transmissible than the very first strain of Covid-19 that was discovered in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic. How fast is it spreading? The new strain is very infectious and as a result, it has managed to spread to over 50 countries, including Singapore. In Singapore, the variant emerged in two of our biggest community clusters recently such as the [Changi Airport](https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/covid-19-singapore-everything-we-know-about-the-changi-airport-cluster) cluster and the [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](https://sg.asiatatler.com/society/singapore-tan-tock-seng-hospital-covid-19-cluster) cluster.
