Session 1 Technology Development and Bioethics Session Chair: Kenneth White, Utah State University Yinan Kan, PhD, Harvard Medical School Unleashing Technology: \"The Inc., 300 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 2 Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA Genomic engineering is the intentional alteration of the genetic information in living cells or organisms. Since CRISPR/Cas9 was repurposed for genome engineering, the \"CRISPR Craze\" is quickly bridging the genotype and phenotype worlds and transforming agricultural engineering. However, CRISRP/Cas9 does not perform genomic engineering by itself, but it induces a site-specific genomic lesion in the 3 billion base pair livestock genome, and invites the DNA repair pathways to introduce the desired modifications. In this presentation, we will walk you through the fundamental DNA repair processes leading to various forms of genetic modifications following a CRISPR cut and showcase the cutting-edge genome editing technologies including multiplex gene knockout, marker-free large homologous recombination, and long-range precision genomic manipulations. In the end, we will highlight eGenesis' efforts in humanizing the porcine immunology and providing safe and effective porcine organs for human transplantation. Yinan Kan graduated from the Eric Hendrickson Lab at the University of Minnesota in 2015. He systematically dissected the mechanisms of homology-directed genome editing with different donors. He then moved on to the George Church Lab at Harvard Medical School and became the principle scientist of eGenesis. He and his colleagues are devoted to delivering safe and effective human transplantable organs from porcine origin using the latest genome editing technologies. They generated the fi rst PERV - inactivated pigs which was highlighted as the cover story in Science in 2017. 7Shengdar Q. Tsai, PhD, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Strategies for Defining and Improving the Specificity of CRISPR-Cas Genome Editing Shengdar Q. Tsai1 1Department of Memphis, TN, USA 38105 CRISPR- Cas genome editing is a technology for making targeted changes to the genomes of living cells with the potential to transform human medicine, biomedical research, biotechnology, and agriculture. Though it is easy to determine whether the intended genome modification is successful, it is substantially more challenging to understand the genome-wide activity. Shengdar Q. Tsai is an assistant member in the Department of Hematology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His lab currently focuses on genome editing technologies for therapeutics, with a special interest in potentially curative genome editing strategies for treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease. Previously, he has developed methods for high-throughput genome editing with TALEN s, and for defining and improving the genome-wide specificity of CRISPR-Cas nucleases. Dr. Tsai completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, a PhD in Functional Genomics and M.S. in Bioinformatics from North Carolina State University, and a B.S. from the University of Michigan. Margaret Foster Riley, J.D., University of Virginia CRISPR Quandaries: Ethics in Large Animal Genetic Engineering Margaret Foster Riley University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, VA When people talk about science and ethics, they often focus on how new scientific advances support or threaten first principle values. But applied ethics provides a way to balance different values held by many different stakeholders and to develop consensus and principles. The questions applied ethics may expose may be as important as the solutions it reveals. Animal biotechnology has long engaged ethical debate, ranging from questions of biodiversity and animal welfare issues to more epistemological questions about \"playing God.\" The advent of CRISPR does not fundamentally change these questions, but it does mean that the technology is no longer limited to universities and companies in a few advanced industrial countries. It also means that some techniques that were previously impossible are now easily within reach. We will explore how applied ethics may be used in the context of large animal genetic engineering in our new CRISPR reality. Margaret Foster Riley teaches food and drug law, health law, bioethics, regulation of clinical research and public health law, and is Direct or of the Animal L aw Program at the University of Virginia School of Law. She is also professor of public health sciences at the university's School of Medicine, and professor of public policy at the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. She has written and presented extensively about biomedical research, genetics, reproductive technologies, animal biotechnology, and stem cell research. She chairs the UVA's Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee and is legal advisor to the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. She is a contributor to Big Data, Health Law, and Bioethics , published in 2018 by Oxford University Press. Prior to joining the University of Virginia faculty, she practiced law in Philadelphia and New York City. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Duke University and law degree from Columbia University. 8Session 2 Livestock Industry Perspective Session Chair: Diane Wray-Cahen, USDA A. Mark Cigan, PhD, Genus R&D Gene Editing to Tackle Livestock Diseases A. Mark Cigan Research and Development, Genus plc, De Forest WI, USA Improvements in livestock genetics through classical methods of breeding and selection to produce high quality meat and increased milk production is a slow and resource intensive process. Animal agriculture stands to gain a huge leap forward with the adoption of new technologies like gene editing to improve disease resistance which will not only improve the health and well-being of the animal but reduce the need for antibiotics. Importantly, rather than backcrossing, gene editing enables the testing and rapid introduction of resistance alleles into the most genetically advanced, commercial lines of pigs and cattle. Gene editing projects at Genus will be presented which aim to improve animal health by delivering disease resistant livestock to farmers while maintaining food quality and enhancing sustainability. Mark Cigan is the T rait Development Director at Genus R&D located near Madison, Wisconsin, where he directs research which uses gene editing to improve animal health and production in livestock. Prior to joining Genus in 2016, Mark was at DuPont Pioneer in Des Moines, Iowa, for 24 years focusing primarily on studying plant reproductive biology for the development of hybrid seed production. Later in his career, Mark led a genome modification group which developed gene editing methods for commercial applications in maize, sorghum, wheat, and soybean. Mark earned his doctorate in yeast genetics and molecular biology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, Illinois. As a National Research Council Fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, Mark studied the biochemistry of RNA regulation of protein synthesis in yeast. 9Michael M. Lohuis, PhD, Semex Alliance New Breeding Techniques - Perspectives from the Cattle Industry Michael M. Lohuis1, Patrick Blondin2 1 The Semex Alliance, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, 2 L'Alliance Boviteq, Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada Cattle breeding has benefitted from several biotechnologies since the 1950s, starting with frozen semen and artificial insemination (AI), followed by embryo transfer, ovum pickup (OPU) and IVF and, more recently, genomic selection. Now, new breeding techniques (NBT), such as gene-editing, can address previously difficult traits and unlock new value for the breeding industry. NBTs have the potential to tackle important traits such as disease resistance and fertility that have made little progress with conventional breeding. By substituting rare but valuable gene variants, such as genes that confer heat tolerance and polledness, into elite genetics, cattle can experience improved health and welfare without the genetic drag on productivity that normally accompanies these traits. However, before these promises can be reached, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed. Technical feasibility: The use of IVF is a significant cost to modern breeding programs and if the rate of successful edits is low, program costs will multiply because non-edited animals may have little or no value. Furthermore, cattle breeders will expect AI bulls to transmit edited traits reliably. Therefore, mosaicism or heterozygosity will be severely penalized in the marketplace. Farmers are also highly cost- sensitive, so companies will unlikely be able to pass along extra production costs in their products. Off-target edits are less worrisome because of stringent post-market testing and evaluation procedures in which bulls with genetic defects are regularly identified and eliminated. Regulatory barriers: Although it is still unclear how NBTs will be regulated in farm animals, there are promising moves for reduced regulation in plants for single base pair changes, null mutations, or for variants that already exist or could be attained with conventional breeding. If lengthy or asynchronous regulation becomes the norm for applications in animals, it is unlikely that companies will proceed with NBTs because competitiveness of new germplasm products are closely tied to age of animals and speed to markets. Consumer acceptance: Perhaps the most unpredictable hurdle is that of consumer acceptance. Early and transparent communication with processors, retailers, and consumers about benefits vs. potential risks, on a case -by-case basis, will be essential to win approval. Michael M. Lohuis is Vice-President of Research and Innovation for Semex Alliance (Guelph, Ontario, Canada), a global dairy and beef breeding cooperative with sales of genetic products and services worldwide. Semex actively utilizes genetic, genomic, and reproductive technologies to accelerate genetic progress for production, health, and economic traits in cattle. From 1998-2017, Dr. Lohuis worked at Monsanto company (St. Louis, MO) leading a range of R&D programs in animal and plant genetics and genomics, statistics, patent science, and environmental and climate change modeling. Prior to joining Monsanto, Dr. Lohuis was an assistant professor in the Animal Breeding Department, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. He obtained his PhD in animal breeding and BSc. in animal science at the University of Guelph. Dr. Lohuis began his career in the Canadian dairy cattle breeding industry as a bull procurement expert and research coordinator of advance reproductive technology trials. 10Johan A.M. van Arendonk, PhD, Hendrix Genetics Gene Editing and Animal Breeding: an Industry Perspective Johan A.M. van Arendonk Hendrix Genetics Research, Technologies & Services, Hendrix Genetics, Boxmeer, Netherlands- EU Gene editing is a rapidly developing technology with many potential applications, including animal breeding. Hendrix Genetics is committed to responsible farm animal breeding. We strive to meet growing global demands for food by supporting animal protein producers worldwide with innovative and sustainable genetic solutions. New technologies, like gene editing, can be part of our future solutions. Alongside delivering benefits to producers, our solutions must also meet the rigorous needs of consumers and society. While we rely on Genomic Selection in our breeding programs, Hendrix Genetics does not currently use any form of gene modification. We, however, continue to closely monitor the rapid developments in gene editing and invest in research in this new technology to evaluate its potential application. Gene editing will help us to get a better understanding of genes and mutations in genes that contribute to genetic variation in traits. That knowledge can be used to improve genomic selection schemes provided that the desired variants are present in the population. When the desired variant is not present, genetic improvement via gene editing is an innovative solution. Investment in research into gene editing does not imply that Hendrix Genetics will necessarily use this technology in the future. Before using a new technology, we need to understand the full impact of it on animals, animal products and humans. We must be convinced of the added value of gene editing before entering any discussion on commercial application. Such discussion will not only cover technical issues but more important ethical and regulatory issues. At the moment, Hendrix Genetics sees several critical challenges ahead for gene editing that must be resolved before commercial application can even be considered. Even with satisfactory results from research, Hendrix Genetics would only ever consider gene editing for applications when it clearly outperforms any alternatives. The most likely application of gene editing appears to be to improve the health and welfare of farm animals (including fish). It is very unlikely to be used for realizing higher production. Johan A.M. van Arendonk is Chief Innovation & Technology Officer at Hendrix Genetics (Boxmeer, Netherlands-EU), a global multi-species animal breeding, genetics, and technology company. Hendrix Genetics has breeding programs in turkeys, layers, guinea fowl, swine, salmon, trout, and shrimp with operations in 24 countries. Johan contributes to strengthening the research and product development activities in these species. Prior to joining Hendrix Genetics, he was full professor and Dean of Sciences at Wageningen University. His research focused on quantitative genetics and the impact on novel technologies on breeding schemes. Over time, he changed from doing research himself to coaching people involved in research and training. He played an active role in coaching a new generation of scientists by supervising over 90 PhD candidates. Dr. van Arendonk obtained his PhD in animal breeding in 1985 at Wageningen University. He grew up on a dairy farm in Bavel, a small village in the South of The Netherlands, where his interest in livestock improvement started. 11L arisa Rudenko, PhD DABT, Visiting Scholar Massachusetts Institute of Technology Governance of Emerging Biotechnologies: An Integrative Approach Larisa Rudenko Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA , USA Governance is a more expansive concept than the statute-driven authorities contained within it, and encompasses issues that may be beyond the direct remit of those statutory authorities. In broadest terms, governance can be thought of as the structures and processes that help to ensure accountability, rule of law, the role of ethics, transparency, and broad-based participation. As such, it covers both science- and values-based concerns. In the past, governance of emerging biotechnology has taken place in a fragmented fashion, with most of the attention from technology developers and regulators focusing on science-based concerns at or near the time of regulatory decision-making. The latter is necessary, but not sufficient for the successful deployment of products, implying that there are other forces at play influencing the degree to which products or technologies are accepted. Governance encompasses all of the funding, business, transparency, ethics, and public awareness issues that often tacitly accompany the emergence of a biotechnology over the entire life cycle of products of emerging biotechnologies. Rather than a roughly linear model of product development and regulatory decision-making, governance may best be thought of as a \"cloud\" of activities encompassing all of the interactive components of product discovery, development, and deployment. Mapping the components of governance structures may allow for explicit considerations of the \"social amplification of risk\" that may conflate public concerns regarding science-based risks with values-based concerns. It can also reveal the shifting composition of stakeholders involved at any particular time that may contribute to the \"pacing problem\" by identifying opportunities or vehicles for engaging in discussions of values-based concerns outside the regulatory decision-making framework. The goal of governance mapping is to have a more comprehensive understanding of the actors and fluxes that influence the ultimate success or failure of a product or a technology. Larisa Rudenko is currently a Visiting Scholar in the Program on Emerging Technology at MIT where she is studying science-and values-based concerns associated with emerging biotechnologies. She has served as the senior advisor for biotechnology at the Center for Veterinary Medicine where she led the agency initiative to develop novel risk-based approaches and resulting policies for the products of animal biotechnology. She directed the program to develop a science-based policy for the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) animals, and created and directed a new FDA administrative unit for the implementation of that program. She has been instrumental in developing science-based policies for the regulation of the products of biotechnology nationally and internationally. She has worked in different venues to develop paradigms to assess the risk/safety for genetic alterations in multiple systems from microorganisms to plants and animals (including humans). Prior to her tenure at the FDA, Dr. Rudenko worked in the consultancy and venture capital fields. She received her PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology from Stony Brook University after completing her doctoral work in DNA damage and repair at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. She is also a Diplomate of the American Board of Toxicology. 12Session 3 Biomedical 1-Human Disease Models Session Chair: Pascal Chavette-Palmer, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique Christopher J. Davies, PhD, Utah State University Production of an Ovine Interferon Type I Receptor Knockout Model Christopher J. Davies 1,2, Zhiqiang Fan1, Misha A. Polejaeva1 1 Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA; 2 Center for Integrated BioSystems, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, USA. The type I interferons, IFN- a and IFN- b, protect animals against viruses by triggering an innate or early response, which controls viral infections until an adaptive immune response develops. IFN- a and IFN- b interact with the same interferon receptor, IFNAR, which is a heterodimer made up of two subunits: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Mice lacking a functional type I interferon receptor are routinely used for studying viral pathogenesis, and for testing viral vaccines and antiviral drugs. We have used CRISPR/Cas9 to produce sheep that are homozygous knockouts for either IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 . Fetal fibroblast cells from an IFNAR2 knockout fetus were more susceptible to infection with Zika virus than wildtype fetal fibroblast cells. In addition, in a preliminary Zika infection trial an IFNAR2 knockout ram died from bloat 16 days post infection while a wildtype control sheep remained healthy until the end of the trial. After further model characterization, these sheep will hopefully become an important large-animal model for studying immune responses to viral infection. Although our initial objective wasn't to produce a model for studying pregnancy recognition, ruminants are unique in that they utilize a type I interferon, interferon tau (IFN- t), for pregnancy recognition. At a critical time in early gestation (days 12-15 in sheep and goats, or days 14-17 in cattle), the placental trophoblast cells secrete IFN- t, which is postulated to act in an autocrine fashion to promote elongation of the conceptus, and in a paracrine fashion to signal the mother to maintain her corpus luteum and not return to estrus. IFN- t is believed to work exclusively through IFNAR. Consequently, knocking out IFNAR would be expected to have reproductive consequences. A surprising finding was that IFNAR knockout somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCN T) embryos had a higher than expected pregnancy rate, 69% over the last two breeding seasons, in comparison to about 30-40% for other SCNT sheep embryos. Furthermore, if the established paradigm is correct, we would expect homozygous IFNAR knockout ewes to be infertile. Consequently, these sheep are also a unique model for studying pregnancy recognition in ruminants. Chris Davies is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences at Utah State University, Director of the university's Center for Integrated BioSystems, and the Associate Director of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station. He earned both his veterinary degree and a PhD in immunogenetics from Cornell University. Dr. Davies received the J. Christian Herr Award from the American Society for Reproductive Immunology in 2006 and was invited to present the 2009 Dr. Raymond O. Berry Memorial Lecture at Texas A&M University. Dr. Davies is an expert in the genetics of the major histocompatibility complex and reproductive immunology in domestic animals. His laboratory studies gene expression and immunoregulation at the maternal-fetal interface in ruminants, and is involved in the development and characterization of transgenic large animal models for biomed ical research. 13Angelika Schnieke, PhD, Technical University of Munich Modelling Human Cancers in Pigs Angelika Schnieke Livestock Biotechnology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany Most animal models of solid cancers are in rodents, particularly genetically engineered mice. However, mice differ significantly from humans in size, lifespan, physiology, anatomy and diet, limiting their usefulness for some studies. Pigs are increasingly recognized as a valuable adjunct to pre-clinical research. Our aim is to provide a series of genetically-defined pigs that model serious and common human cancers. These will allow new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to be investigated at human scale, and longitudinal studies under conditions that mimic the human patient. We are thus engaged in a program of gene targeting to replicate in pigs a series of genetic lesions known to underlie human cancers. Somatic mutations of the major tumor suppressor gene TP53 are present in most human cancers, therefore we have created gene- targeted knockout pigs and pigs carrying a latent TP53R167H mutant allele orthologous to human mutant TP53R175H that can be activated by Cre recombination. Mutations in the proto- oncogene KRAS are indicative of poor prognosis in several cancers, and mutant KRAS is a driver of pancreatic cancer. Pigs have also been generated carrying a Cre-inducible KRASG12D mutation that can be activated locally to mimic pancreatic and other cancers. In order to prove Cre-activity in a defined organ, we have placed a Cre-inducible dual fluorescent reporter by gene targeting at the porcine ROSA26 locus to achieve ubiquitous expression. To model colorectal cancer, we have generated gene-targeted cloned pigs carrying two different nonsense mutations in APC (APC1061 and APC1311). Histological and molecular analysis showed that the porcine model recapitulates all major features of early stage human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We will report on the progress in the derivation of porcine models for human cancer and their disease phenotype. Angelika Schnieke currently holds the Chair of Livestock Biotechnology at the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen and previously worked in the biotechnology industry and at renowned academic research institutes in the UK, USA, Switzerland, and Germany. She has been instrumental in the development of key techniques in the genetic manipulation of mice and large animals , e.g., cell-mediated transgenesis and gene targeting by nuclear transfer. She has considerable experience in the production of pharmaceutical proteins in livestock species, stem cells, xenotransplantation, and genetically defined animal models. She currently serves on various national and European advisory, funding, and award committees. 14Christopher S. Rogers, PhD, Exemplar Genetics Porcine Models of Rare Human Diseases Christopher S. Rogers Exemplar Genetics, Coralville, IA, USA Over 300 million people in the world are currently afflicted with a rare disease. Most of the nearly 7,000 rare diseases are caused by single gene mutations, making them particularly amenable to targeted therapeutic strategies. However, the relatively small patient populations associated with these diseases have typically meant less funding for research and less interest from drug developers. Because of this, the small research communities for each of these diseases rely on shared, common, high quality resources in order to make meaningful progress. One of the most important research tools for these communities is an appropriate animal model. While most single gene disorders have been modeled in rodents, very few recapitulate key clinical features of the human disease, and thus have limited translational utility. In contrast, genetically modified large animals, particularly pigs, have recently been used to more accurately geno- and pheno- copy human diseases, providing improved models in which to better understand disease mechanisms and develop new therapeutic strategies. Such models are especially important for rare diseases, in which patient populations are too small for (or already enrolled in) clinical trials. In these cases, porcine disease models can serve a key role, not in just bridging the substantial gap between rodents and humans, but further refining and prioritizing the drug pipeline prior to moving into humans. This presentation will discuss current progress in the development and production of several porcine models of rare human diseases. Chris Rogers is the Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Exemplar Genetics. He received his PhD in pharmacology from Vanderbilt University focusing on gene therapy. He then completed post-doctoral training at the University of Iowa where he and colleagues created the first knockout and knock-in models of a human disease in a large animal species - cystic fibrosis in pigs. This work led to the founding of Exemplar Genetics in 2008. The company is focused on the development and characterization of large animal models of human disease and providing housing, husbandry, and logistical support for research using these models. At Exemplar Genetics, Dr. Rogers has generated models of cardiovascular disease, cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, muscular dystrophy, several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and polycystic kidney disease, among many others. Exemplar Genetics was acquired by Intrexon in 2015 . 15Session 4 Farm Animal Breeding Session Chair: Jeffrey Mason, Utah State University Jon M. Oatley, PhD, Washington State University Editing of the Nanos2 Gene to Produce Germline Ablated Male Livestock Jon M. Oatley Center for Reproductive Biology, School of Molecular Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164 Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) possess the remarkable capacity to regenerate spermatogenesis following isolation from testes of a donor male and transplantation into testes of a recipient male. Over two decades ago, methodology to exploit this feature was developed for mice to produce recipient males that transmit donor haplotype to offspring via natural mating. A paradigm in which SSCs can be isolated from testes of a genetically desirable male and transplanted into the testes of a battery of recipient males could provide an advanced reproductive technology for enhancing genetic gain in commercial beef cattle and pig production. Realizing this potential requires recipient males that serve as surrogates for donor-derived spermatogenesis. Ideally, testes of a surrogate sire would completely lack endogenous germline but normal somatic support cell function would be intact. To achieve this, we have targeted the NANOS2 gene in porcine and bovine embryos using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology to create inactivating mutations. For pigs, NANOS2 knockout boars were found to be sterile due to germline ablation. Importantly, we discovered that testes of NANOS2 knockout boars are capable of harboring regeneration of donor-derived spermatogenesis following transplantation of wild-type SSCs. These findings represent a key proof-of-principal step in the development of surrogate sires as a breeding tool in livestock production. Jon M. Oatley is the director of the Center for Reproductive Biology and a professor in the School of Molecular Biosciences at Washington State University. Dr. Oatley received a Bachelor of Sciences degree in Animal Sciences from the University of Nevada-Reno, a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree from Washington State University, completed a Postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, and has been on the faculty at Washington State University since 2011. Over the course of nearly two decades, Dr. Oatley's research has focused on understanding how germ cells develop which are the eternal link between parents and their offspring. Because they are the only cell type in the body that provides genetic information to the next generation, germ cells drive diversity and ensure continuity of all animals. Dr. Oatley's research also focuses on developing novel breeding tools in farm animals to exploit desirable genetics and enhance the efficiency of livestock production for feeding the expanding global human population. 16Pablo J. Ross, PhD, University of California Efficient Derivation of Bovine ESC: Prospective for In Vitro Breeding Pablo J. Ross Department of Animal Science, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA The combination of efficient derivation of bovine embryonic stem cells (ESC) with the recent report of in vitro generation of functional gametes from murine ESC (Hikabe et al., 2016; Nature 539:299-303), allows us to propose a new breeding scheme that we re fer to as In Vitro Breeding (IVB). The concept consists of applying genomic selection to ESC derived from high genetic merit embryos and subjecting genetically superior ESC to in vitro germ cell differentiation followed by in vitro fertilization and new ESC derivation from obtained embryos, and re-starting the cycle again. In Vitro Breeding would thus result in consecutive rounds of genomic selection, meiosis, and fertilization, without involving gestation and development to puberty, which farm animals, such as cattle, take a significant amount of time. In IVB, the generational interval could be significantly reduced from 2.5 years in cattle to only a few months, which would result in a dramatic acceleration of genetic improvement. We recently reported on the successful derivation of bovine ESC (Bogliotti et al., 2018; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S shown stable morphology, transcriptome, karyotype, population-doubling time, pluripotency marker expression, and epigenetic features. Bovine ESC resemble primed pluripotent cells, which are a typical starting point for in vitro germ cell generation. Bovine ESC could be derived with high efficiency, were easy to propagate by simple enzymatic single cell dissociation methods, and were established from embryo to cell line in as few as 3 weeks, all important characteristics for implementing high-throughput approaches. Also, these cells were successfully used to generate blastocysts by nuclear transfer/cloning, which could constitute an output from the IVB system once an optimal genotype has been achieved. In order for IVB to be realized, the next step will be to induce bovine ESC to differentiate to functional gametes. Pablo Ross specializes in animal reproduction with emphasis on gametes, early embryos, and embryonic stem cells. The focus is on epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of pluripotency and the impact of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) on these mechanisms. His lab uses a comparative approach which includes different species (cattle, sheep, pig, horses, mice, monkeys, humans), different models of ART, and varied models of nuclear reprogramming, and uses next-generation sequencing approaches to determine transcriptome and epigenetic profiles. The lab generates epigenetic data from multiple tissues from large animals to aid efforts to annotate the functional regions of animal genomes and, for mechanistic studies, routinely microinject siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 into oocytes and zygotes to then study consequences of gene knockdown/knockout on embryonic development. Dr. Ross is an Associate Professor in the College of Biological Sciences at University of California - Davis and on the executive committee of the Genome Editing for Enhanced Animal Production project. He earned his DVM degree at La Plata National University, M.S. in animal science at Mar del Plata National University, and PhD in animal science at Michigan State University. 17Session 5 Biotechology Session Chair: Simon Lillico, The Roslin Institute Hua Wu, PhD, SAB Biotherapeutics Using Fully Human Antibodies from Tc Bovine to Fight Infectious Diseases Hua Wu , Jin-an Jiao and Eddie Sullivan SAB Biotherapeutics Inc., Sioux Falls, SD 57104 SD, USA. Antibody-based passive immunotherapies are used to treat a variety of human diseases including infectious diseases . However, polyclonal antibodies, derived from human or animal plasma donors, and monoclonal antibodies have their own limitations. The shortage of human plasma supply limits broad implementation of human plasma-derived pAbs. Although animal-derived pAbs could be an alternative to human plasma-derived pAbs, they may cause severe reactions/toxicity in human which restricts the applications of these animal-derived pAbs. Monoclonal antibody therapies suffer from the drawbacks of, in the case of treating viral infections, losing their effectiveness against escape mutants. To overcome these limitations, SAB Biotherapeutics has developed an innovative transchromosomal (Tc) bovine platform with the capacity to produce a large quantity of highly potent fully-human pAbs against any antigen of interest. In the Tc bovine platform, the bovine immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are genetically inactivated and their functions are reconstituted with a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire repertoire of human Ig genes in their germline configurations. The Tc-bovines produce fully-human immunoglobulin (hIgG), and, upon hyperimmunization with an antigen of choice, can rapidly produce up to 600 grams of highly potent hIgGs per month per animal. Using the Tc bovine platform, several highly potent hIgG products have been developed, including those targeting influenza with animal models (mice, hamsters or non-human primates) have demonstrated that hIgGs produced from Tc bovines are highly effective in treating these pathogens. Currently, two of these hIgG products are in human clinical trials. Anti-MERS CoV hIgG product SAB - 301 was safe and well tolerated in a completed Phase I clinical trial with an average half- life ( t1/2) of ~ 28 days and no immunogenicity in human. Moreover, anti- Mycoplasma hominis hIgG product SAB-136 has been demonstrated safety and efficacy in a Phase I clinical trial in treating an immunodeficient patient with a multi-year chronic antibiotic resistant M. hominis infection. Taken together, SAB Biotherapeuti cs has established a novel Tc bovine platform that can rapidly produce potent passive immunotherapeutics for treating a variety of infectious diseases . Hua Wu is Vice President of Vaccine and Antibody Development at SAB Biotherapeutics, directing development of vaccines and immunization programs to produce highly potent, fully human therapeutic antibodies from transchromosomal (Tc) bovine. She also oversees development of bioanalytical assays, immunological characterization of immune responses, and functional studies of antigen-specific human antibodies from Tc bovine. She leads numerous projects at SAB Biotherapeutics developing Tc bovine-derived human antibodies against cancer and infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV, Ebola, Influenza, Hanta, and mycoplasma. Dr. Wu was previously executive director of vaccinology and antibody characterization at Hematech, Inc., where she led numerous projects to generate and characterize Tc bovine-derived human antibodies against cancer, anthrax, MRSA, and Botulinum toxin. She conducted postdoctoral research in the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School.

Telugu, PhD, University of Maryland Unlocking the Translational Potential of Large Animals 1Animal and Avian Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA; 2Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory; ARS, USDA, Beltsville, MD, USA;3RenOVAte Biosciences Inc, Reisterstown, MD, USA Genetic modification of livestock has a longstanding and successful history, starting with domestication several thousand years ago. Modern animal breeding strategies predominantly based on marker-assisted and genomic selection, artificial insemination, and embryo transfer have led to significant improvement in the performance of domestic animals. However, the current strategy of breeding animals over multiple generations to introduce novel traits is not realistic in responding to the unprecedented challenges such as changing climate, pandemic diseases, and feeding an anticipated 3 billion increase in global population in the next three decades. Consequently, sophisticated genetic modifications that allow for seamless introgression of novel alleles or traits and introduction of precise modifications without affecting the overall genetic merit of the animal are required for addressing these pressing challenges. The requirement for precise modifications is especially important in the context of modeling human diseases for the development of therapeutic interventions. Large animal models, including domestic pigs, are an attractive model for biomedical research because of similarities in anatomy and physiology to humans. There is an emerging consensus in the biomedical community for the use of large animal models, such as pigs, to either serve as an alternative, or complement investigations from the mouse. In this regard, the availability of CRISRPs and other genome editors that allow for targeted modification of genomes in one generation has proven to be transformative to the genetic engineering field. The animal science community envisions the genome editors as essential tools in addressing these critical priorities in agriculture and biomedicine, and for advancing livestock genetic engineering for agriculture, biomedical as well as \"dual purpose\" applications. Bhanu Telugu is an Assistant Professor at University of Maryland-College Park, and a Visiting Scientist in the Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory at USDA, ARS, Beltsville, MD. Dr. Telugu is also a founding member, president & CEO of RenOVAte Biosciences Inc., a livestock genetic engineering company. Primary research interests of his laboratory and his company are genetic engineering/biotechnology and reproductive biology. The laboratory employs genome editing tools such as CRISPRs for site -specifically altering the genome in large animal models, such as pigs, for agricultural and biomedical applications. Specifically, genome editing tools are employed to alter alleles to facilitate \"rational selection\" of agricultural traits. The laboratory is actively engaged in developing porcine models of human disease (diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity), and developing technologies for transplantation research where pig is a preferred animal model.

The sheep was predicted to be a potentially ideal model for cystic fibrosis (CF) studies as the development and function of the respiratory epithelium of the sheep lung shows close s imilarities to the human lung, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) sequence has a high degree of homology between sheep and humans at both the nucleic acid and the polypeptide levels. We recently generated a sheep model with a disruption of the CFTR gene. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique was used to disrupt the CFTR gene in Romney sheep fetal fibroblast cells that were subsequently used for the production of CFTR +/- and CFTR -/- cloned lambs by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Details on generation of the CFTR -null sheep as well as histological characterization of this model will be provided. Additionally, functional analysis of primary tracheal epithelial cell cultures derived for m CFTR -null and control animals will be presented. Irina Polejaeva earned her PhD in developmental biology from the National Institute of Animal Science, Moscow, Russia. She is currently a Professor in the Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences at Utah State University and a member of the Utah Multidisciplinary Arrhythmia Consortium. Dr. Polejaeva is also a member of the Veterinary Diagnostics and Infectious Disease USTAR program. She served for 8 years as chief scientific officer at ViaGen Inc., led the Cell Biology Group, and was project manager for the Porcine Nuclear Transfer Program at PPL Therapeutics Inc. Her work led to the generation of the world's first cloned pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer and the birth of the world's first 1, 3-galactosyltransferase deficient pigs. Her primary emphasis is development of genetically engineered large animal models for biomedical research. Ann Harris is the Leonard C. Hanna Professor, Ohio Eminent Scholar in Stem Cell Genomics, and vice chair of research at Case Western Reserve University. The main focus of her lab is on transcriptional networks that coordinate chromatin architecture and gene expression in epithelial cells lining the human lung, intestine, pancreas and male genital ducts. These sites are involved in the common human genetic disease, cystic fibrosis. Respiratory epithelium is also compromised in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Digestive tract epithelium is a site of active pathology in inflammatory bowel disease and related disorders. Obstruction of male genital ducts underlies several diseases resulting in infertility. In addition, epithelial cells are sites of initiation of many cancers of the lung, pancreas, and intestine. Hence, her lab's research goals are to facilitate therapeutics for these conditions. Harris earned her B.S. and M.A. at the University of Oxford and her PhD at the University of London. 20Tom Wishart, PhD, The Roslin Institute Modelling Lysosomal Storage Disorders in Sheep Tom Wishart, Sam Eaton, Simon Lillico, Chris Proudfoot, Tim King, Bruce Whitelaw The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK Lysosomal storage disorder is a collective term for conditions caused by mutations in one of an ever-increasing number of genes, each of which impairs an aspect of lysosome function. We are particularly interested in an early onset infantile form of lysosomal storage disorder termed CLN1. This disease is caused by a mutation (commonly at R151) in the gene PPT1 which codes for the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. Onset and duration of disease varies between patients but symptoms include blindness, cognitive, coordination and motor deficits with premature death occurring between 8 & 13 years old [for a review see 1]. Murine models exist and they have been useful in studying some of the structural and molecular effects of the mutation in vivo . However, there are limits in terms of overlap with human disease due to features such as reduced size, anatomical discrepancies including reduced white matter content, volume and neuronal density of key targeted regions such as the substantia nigra or complete absence of brain regions containing gyrencephalic cortex, separate caudate and putamen or subthalamic nuclei. This is exemplified by differences in CLN1 rodent \"regional\" disease progression within the brain compared to human patients. Here, we sought to generate a new larger animal model for CLN1 disease which could serve to bridge the translational gap between rodent modelling and human disease progression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we introduced the same mutation seen in the human population at R151. As with humans, the homozygous mutant sheep develop accumulation of characteristic autofluorescent storage material, blindness by 12 months and motor deficits. A humanely defined end point was reached at 18 months old. MRI analysis confirms regional brain alterations in keeping with human disease presentation and post mortem analysis shows a 34% decrease in brain weight. We postulate that further characterization of this line will provide a much-needed large animal model for biomarker discovery, translational imaging, and pre-clinical therapeutic assessment. Studies are currently underway to confirm the physiological relevance of this model. 1. Mole et al. (2005) Neurogenetics 6:107-126 Dr. Tom Wishart gained his PhD in molecular and cellular neuroscience in 2006 and has since contributed to >50 manuscripts. His research focused on developing methods to identify factors regulating the stability of the nervous system in health and disease. This was primarily through a combination of anatomically dictated molecular analyses of differentially vulnerable neuronal populations. In 2011 he took up a Junior Group Leader position at The Roslin Institute, which drove his research to include comparisons across a diverse array of model systems and to develop the capability to move seamlessly between pathological assessment and molecular analysis of mammalian (including but not limited to murine, ovine & equine) neuronal systems, through in silico identification of potential regulatory cascades, and lower order model-based in vivo assessment of candidate ability to modulate neuronal morphology and/or stability. His group's multi-species comparative approaches have been published as recommended workflows for novel therapeutic target identification.

One such technology is the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9), which has overcome most technical challenges encountered in pig genome engineering. During the last few years, we have made several improvements to enhance and simplify the generation of pig models, such as multiplexed gene editing and the simplified SCNT method, handmade cloning. Using all these technologies, we have successfully generated pig models for breast cancer and diabetes, as well as for the purpose of xenotransplantation. Currently, we can further apply the CRISPR genetic screening platform to determine the best genetic modifications to combat immune rejection. In this presentation, I will share with you the technologies we have developed for pig genome engineering, as well as the biomedical pig models developed for regenerative medicine.

Lombardi, PhD, Center for Veterinary Medicine, FDA FDA's Regulation of Intentionally Genetically Altered Animals Heather A. Lombardi Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine The FDA utilizes a flexible, risk-based approach to the regulation of intentionally genetically altered animals based on sound science for the development of safe and effective products, while ensuring consumer confidence. In this presentation, Dr. Lombardi will define the regulated article and provide information regarding the laws and regulations stipulating FDA's authority to regulate intentional genetic alterations in animals. Furthermore, she will provide an overview and current status update of the recently issued Draft Guidance for Industry (GFI) #187 Regulation of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals. Dr. Lombardi will also provide information about the FDA's regulatory approaches for intentionally genetically altered animals, ranging from no prior FDA review for intentional genetic alterations that pose minimal risk or are already adequately regulated, to new animal drug application (NADA) approvals. For an NADA approval, data and information must be provided to demonstrate the safety and effecti veness of the intentional genetic alteration (21 CFR 514.1). The FDA utilizes a product- specific risk-based process to determine exactly what data and information are needed to address these statutory requirements specific to intentionally genetically altered animals. In the presentation, she will provide information pertaining to new tools developed to enhance the efficiency and predictability of the review process for intentional genetic alterations to animals. She will also provide an overview of some of the risk questions relevant to intentional genetic alterations to animals, and the potential impact on safety and effectiveness. Lastly, Dr. Lombardi will provide insight into the importance of FDA regulatory oversight and the impact on consumer confidence. Heather Lombardi leads the newly formed Animal Bioengineering and Cellular Therapies Team in the Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).

She has led efforts to provide guidance and policy to stakeholders specific to the regulation of new technologies. Dr. Lombardi holds a PhD in biological chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.S. in chemistry (biochemistry track) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 23Laura R. Epstein, J.D., Center for Veterinary Medicine, FDA Clearing Up the Confusion: FDA Addresses Common Misconceptions Laura R. Epstein Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine In 2009, the FDA issued a guidance document on the regulation of genetically engineered animals. Since that time, we have gained insight into areas that stakeholders and consumers have found confusing about the agency's regulation. In this presentation, Dr. Epstein will directly address some of those areas and seek to provide some clarity. To begin with, the talk will discuss the law with respect to FDA drug regulation and how and why it applies in this area. Some of the questions the speaker will address on this subject are: Why does FDA use its animal drug authorities in this area? Is the animal a drug? Why does it matter what the developer's intent is in developing its product/animal? Why does the government regulate plants produced through biotechnology differently than it regulates animals produced through biotechnology? Additionally, she will discuss some of its prior regulatory decisions and why some of the common narratives about them are misleading or incomplete, and how the FDA is currently providing flexibility and might in the future provide more with appropriate justification. Laura R. Epstein is currently the Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of the Center Director at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. In this role, she provides policy advice on a range of issues concerning animal drugs and foods with a concentration on issues involving animal biotechnology, including advising on statutory authority for regulation of products derived from animal biotechnology. Previously, she was Senior Policy Counsel in the Office of Science in FDA's C enter for Tobacco Products, and she was senior counsel in the FDA Office of Chief Counsel where she provided legal counsel on issues involving medical devices and veterinary medicine, including animal biotechnology. 24Session 8 Feeding the World Session Chair: Benjamin Beaton, Genus plc Jianguo Zhao, PhD, State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology Production of Leaner Pigs with Better Thermoregulation Qiantao Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Reproductive Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China 100101; bKey Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China 100101; cInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100101; dEnergetics Research Group, Zoology Department, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK AB24 2TZ; eInstitute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing , China 100193; 1Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to J. Zhao zhaojg@ioz.ac.cn; Uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1 ) is localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane and generates heat by uncoupling ATP synthesis from proton transit across the inner membrane. UCP1 is a key element of non- shivering thermogenesis and is most likely important in the regulation of body adiposity. Pigs (Artiodactyl family Suidae ) lack a functional UCP1 gene, resulting in poor thermoregulation and susceptibility to cold, which is an economic and pig welfare issue owing to neonatal mortality. Pigs also have a tendency toward fat accumulation, which may be linked to their lack of UCP1 , and thus influencing the efficiency of pig production. Here, we report application of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, homologous recombination (HR)-independent approach to efficiently insert mouse knock-in (KI) pigs showed an improved ability to maintain body temperature during acute cold exposure, but they did not have alterations in physical activity levels or total daily energy expenditure (DEE). Furthermore, ectopic UCP1 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) dramatically decreased fat deposition by 4.89% ( P < 0.01), consequently increased carcass lean percentage (CLP) ( P < 0.05). Mechanism studies indicated that the loss of fat upon UCP1 activation in WAT was linked to elevated lipolysis. UCP1 KI pigs are a potentially valuable resource for agricultural production through their combination of cold adaptation, which improves pig welfare and reduces economic losses, with reduced fat deposition and increased lean meat production.

Sonstegard1, Marcos V.B. SP, Brasil Genetic improvement programs for food animals raised in tropical production systems often lag compared to those found in temperate zones for a multitude of reasons ranging from poor infrastructure to endemic disease challenges. Although genome selection programs have now been initiated for popular breeds in Australia and Brazil, other technologies are needed to introduce economically important traits that accelerate genetic improvement for livestock systems in countries with emerging economies. Gene editing based on site-directed nucleases is recognized as one of those methods best suited to introduce high effect adapted alleles into proven, high-value cattle pedigrees. Herein, we review how multiple mutations for thermal adaptation were found using population genomic approaches on Criollo cattle and how these truncated variants might be conferring adapted phenotypes in a taurine genetic background. We also discuss the pre-commercial deployment of SLICK variants in beef and dairy cattle breeds and their potential economic value to producers. Finally, perspectives for regulatory approval and commercialization are summarized to highlight some of the challenges, which may hinder the widespread adoption of gene editing alleles, like SLICK, to create emerging markets and complement efforts of genome-directed animal breeding. Tad Sonstegard is currently Chief Scientific Officer of Acceligen, a Recombinetics company, where he leads both business development and research efforts dedicated to discovery of causative sequence variants in food animals. The goal is to apply genome editing for livestock genetic improvement that promotes sustainability and animal welfare. Previously at the USDA-ARS Beltsville, he led a genomics research program in developing applications in germplasm conservation and genetic improvement that included the first commercially successful, ag-based SNP tool. He also identified causative variation affecting fertility and thermo-tolerance in cattle, and has led consortia to generate genome assemblies of the water buffalo, goat, Zebu cattle, and an expression atlas of cattle. Dr. Sonstegard received his undergraduate degree from Iowa State University and his PhD from the University of Minnesota. His has published 191 peer-reviewed articles and has received award recognition for his work in genomic research for livestock genetic improvement. 26Nick Manson, PhD, International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi Laying the Way: Preparing for the Introduction of Transgenic Trypanosome Resistant Animals into Sub-Saharan Africa Nick Manson International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi (part of the CGIAR group of research institutions) Where it is endemic, Trypanosomiasis has been a blight on domestic livestock and agriculture around the world for centuries. Indeed, in Africa, in what is known as the 'Tsetse Belt' South of the Sahara, the disease has precluded the development of any agriculture dependent on cattle for traction, transport, and soil fertility. In addition, infected animals are known to act as a reservoir of the disease for transfer, as Sleeping Sickness, to humans. Many attempts have been made to address trypanosomiasis including breeding, pharmaceuticals, and Tsetse fly control. These have generally been unsuccessful, toxic, and/or prohibitively expensive. A scientific program to create transgenic, trypanosome resistant cattle has been running for over 10 years and is expecting to producing the first transgenic calves in 2019. This talk will give an update on the state of the scientific program and will also focus on the \"change program\" gradually being introduced to ensure the successful introduction of these cattle, once through a testing period, into African society. Nick Manson is a program manager, strategist, business intelligence and knowledge specialist. Nick has a broad background in the health sector, working with public and non-governmental organizations in a board-level management, specialist or consultative capacity. He has worked internationally and at local, regional, and national levels. Originally working in developing countries, Nick acquired experience of child health, program evaluation, and relief planning. He has held senior positions in health services in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand and undertaken consultancies in many countries. He is an experienced strategist, communicator and facilitator, and has degrees in biochemistry, public health nutrition, computer science, and a PhD in health services strategy. 27Bruce Whitelaw, PhD, Roslin Institute, United Kindgom Genome Editing: The is Justified Bruce Whitelaw, Chris Proudfoot and Simon Lillico The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK It is a mere 6 years since the CRISPR/cas9 revolution started. Prior to the development of this tool, first ZFN and then TALEN were available - but it is the ease and speed of working with CRISPR reagents which has driven media attention and much hype. These tools are now nearly ubiquitous in research labs across the world. The regulatory system is actively engaged in assessing how to place 'edited animals' into their systems. Industry is chasing new differentiated products paralleled by emergence of a plethora of new animal biotech companies. And no wonder why - genome editing technologies have enabled the functional deletion of PERVs from the pig genome, the generation of pigs and chickens that lack germ cells, the production of PRRSV resistant pigs, and of polled cattle. This all in addition to the promise of engineering tropical adaption traits into highly-productive livestock and the renewed development of pigs and sheep as models of human disease. The genome editing tools are precise, enabling subtle specific changes to the genome. We are only starting to explore the potential of this technology. Yes, the hype is justified. Bruce Whitelaw was awarded a BSc degree in medical microbiology (virology elective) from the University of Edinburgh in 1982 and his PhD in 1987 from the University of Glasgow. His career has been dedicated to the development and application of gene expression systems in genetically engineered animals. Bruce is currently Deputy Director (Partnerships) at The Roslin Institute where he holds the Genus Chair in Animal Biotechnology. Building from early work in transgenic livestock as bioreactors of human biomedical proteins in milk, Bruce has pioneered the use of lentivirus vectors for transgene delivery and more recently genome editors for precise genetic engineering of livestock. He seeks to apply this technology in the field of animal biotechnology, specifically to develop novel ways to combat infectious disease in animals, evaluate strategies to enhance overall reproductive efficiency, devise novel protein production systems, and explore opportunities to develop new treatments of disease through appropriate genetically engineered animal models. His interest and expertise in animal biotechnology includes the development of innovative in vitro driven assisted reproductive technologies.

Grb10 gene is an imprinted gene expressed from embryonic stages into adulthood. In mice, Grb10 parental alleles are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with the expression of the maternal allele in the placental trophoblasts and most embryonic tissues. The paternal allele is expressed in certain regions of the brain. Grb10 expression in the adult is limited to few tissues with the maternal allele expressed in muscle tissues and the paternal copy maintains its expression in the midbrain. While maternal knockdown of Grb10 is associated with foetal growth, a function shared with several other imprinted genes, knocking down of the paternal allele mice is associated with increased social dominance. The interactors of Grb10 in the brain, however, are not yet known. In this project, I aimed to uncover the potential molecular interactors mediating Grb10's function in the brain. For this, I obtained whole genome transcriptional profiles using Illumina RNA -Seq technology for the midbrain where paternally inherited Grb10 expressed in adult stages and the neocortex where Grb10 is not expressed for mutant Grb10KO+/p and wild-type. Using differential gene expression analyses, I identified a set of genes altered in the paternal mutant Grb10KO+/p. I further examined how these sets of genes change over time by examining samples taken at different developmental stages. Gene expression profile changes in the Grb10KO in the brain are distinct from gene expression changes in the liver suggesting that the maternal and paternal alleles are associated to different sets of genes in different tissues. Co-expression analyses revealed significant shifts in gene- to- gene relationships in the KO context. Together with my results provide insights into the molecular interactors of Grb10 in the brain and may give clues as to how Grb10 influences social dominance. A Transgenic S wine Model to Elucidate Ovarian Steroidogenesis in Gilts Amy T. Desaulniers, Rebecca A. Cederberg, Ginger A. Mills, Brett R. White. Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA The second form of GnRH (GnRH-II) and its cognate receptor (GnRHR- II) are produced in only one livestock species, the pig. Paradoxically, their interaction does not stimulate gonadotropin secretion. Instead, both are abundantly produced within the gonads and have been implicated in autocrine/paracrine regulation of steroidogenes is. To elucidate the role of GnRH-II and its receptor in pigs, our laboratory generated a transgenic swine line with ubiquitous knockdown (KD) of GnRHR-II. The objective of this study was to evaluate ovarian function and steroidogenesis in GnRHR-II KD (n=8) and littermate control (n=7) gilts. samples were 29collected at the onset of estrus (follicular) and 10 d later (luteal). Serum samples were subjected to HPLC -MS/MS to quantify concentrations of 16 steroid hormones. Ovarian weight, ovulation rate and weight of each excised corpus luteum (CL) were recorded at euthanasia. A line (GnRHR-II KD versus control) x phase (follicular versus luteal) interaction was detected for serum progesterone concentrations ( P=0.0341). In follicular phase samples, serum progesterone levels were not different between GnRHR-II KD and control females ( P>0.10). As expected, progesterone concentrations increased in the luteal phase samples of females from both lines (P<0.05); however, progesterone levels were reduced in transgenic compared with control gilts (P=0.0329). A tendency for a line effect was observed for 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11- deoxycortisol; transgenic females tended to produce less of these steroids than control gilts (P<0.10). A phase effect was of these steroid hormones were greater in follicular compared with luteal samples (P<0.05). Conversely, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone concentrations were elevated in samples collected during the luteal phase (P<0.05). At euthanasia, ovarian weight did not differ between lines ( P>0.10) whereas ovulation rate was reduced in GnRHR-II KD compared to control gilts (P=0.0123). However, average CL weight was greater in GnRHR-II KD compared with control females (P <0.0001); therefore, total CL weight tended to be reduced in transgenic gilts (P=0.0958). Ultimately, these data suggest that GnRH-II and its receptor may regulate ovulation rate, CL development and progesterone production in gilts.

Multiple specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed targeting the coding sequences of and the corresponding gene targeting vectors were constructed. Gene targeting efficiency analysis in goat fibroblasts showed that the sgRNAs were efficient in directing Cas9 to generate targeted indels in corresponding Ig genes with efficiencies ranging between 15 and 40%. We then first targeted the IGHM gene and generated IGHM -/- cloned fetuses by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using single cell-derived IGHM-/- fibroblast colonies as nuclear donors and established 30IGHM-/- fetal fibroblast cell lines.

Ma ny vaccines are produced i n embryonated hen's eggs; however, it is well establishe d that the rate determining ste p in the manufacture of numerous vaccines is the inducti on of antiviral immune responses withi n the embr yo that inhibit the replicati on of vaccine viruses. This project aims t o generate chIFITM knock-out chickens usi ng cutting-edge gene editing techniques. We believe that this approac h will overcome the bottlenec k in egg-based vaccine production, resulti ng in increase d vaccine yields a nd drasticall y reduci ng animal numbers a nd the time neede d for vaccine manufacture. Hypothesis : Targete d knock-out of chIFITM gene expressi on using gene editi ng will overcome the rate limiti ng ste p in egg-based vaccine production, directly resulti ng in increase d vaccine yields and improve the spee d of manufacture . Scientific Rationale: Type I interferons protect cells from virus infection through the induction of interferon-stimulate d genes (ISGs). Am ong these interferon stimulate d proteins, are the IFITM (i nterferon-inducible transmembrane) genes, widel y characterize d for their role i n restricting i nfecti on by both envelope d and non-envelope d viruses, includi ng several highl y pathogenic hum an and animal viruses. These diverse viruses range from severe acute respirator y syndrome ( SARS) coronavirus, filoviruses (Marburg virus an d Ebola virus), influenza A viruses (IAVs), flaviviruses (dengue virus), as well as lentiviruses HIV- 1 and SIV. The Genetics a nd Genomics gr oup at The Pirbright Institute was the first to identify and characterise these antiviral proteins in the chicke n (chIFITM). The y have show n that a reduction in chIFITM expressi on results i n an increase i n the virus titre in CEFs infected wit h avian influenza A virus (AIV) H9N2, suggesti ng that chIFITMs have a functional role i n the control of viral infections. We believe that our approach will overcome the rate limiting step in vaccine production, directly resulting in increased vaccine yields and improve input costs and the speed at which vaccines can be manufactured. 31This project will involve a partnership of the Pirbright Institute and the Roslin Institute, who will contribute their extensive expertise in gene editing technologies of chickens. We believe our technology offers a platform to significantly increase viral vaccine titres in embryonated SPF hen's eggs. In terms of animal welfare, over 250 million post day 14 incubated eggs are culled for virus production each year. Increasing viral titre in eggs could reduce this number by 30% or more. The total revenue for vaccines produced in eggs is approximately $3.4 billion (BCC Research). Our aim is to develop the technology to a stage where it can be licensed directly to vaccine manufacturers. In summary, this project will be instrumental for enhancing availability of vaccines and represents a clear opportunity for international advances in preventing human and animal viral disease. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Gene Editing in Diseased HERDA Dirk Vanderwall1 1 Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA; 2 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive disease of American Quarter horses, with the highest prevalence in reining and cutting horses. HERDA is caused by a missense mutation (c. 115G>A) in exon 1 of the peptidyl-prolyl Isomerase B (PPIB) gene which codes for cyclophilin B. The HERDA mutation decreases the affinity of cyclophilin B for collagen which impedes collagen synthesis and decreases tensile strength. Symptoms include fragile skin prone to ulcerative lesions and subdermal hematomas, decreased cornea thickness, and hypermobility. CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology may provide opportunities to utilize gene therapy to correct HERDA mutations. To test these new methods, we first established an equine fibroblast cell line from a horse homozygous for the HERDA mutation. We then designed several single- guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the sequences in the proximity of the 115G>A mutation in the PPIB gene and transfected the cultured fibroblasts with sgRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex, or deletions (INDELS) to the HERDA mutation region\u2014a preemptive step for measuring CRISPR/Cas9 design efficiency. Now, with a proven sgRNA design for DNA editing, we are in the process of correcting the 115G>A mutation by simultaneously delivering the sgRNA/Cas9 RNP and donor template DNA into the equine fibroblasts carrying the HERDA-mutation to induce an A to G single nucleotide conversion, thus restoring the HERDA mutation to wild type. Our research goal is to correct the mutation in HERDA carriers and establish mutation-corrected cell lines for somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone horses free of HERDA. In the meantime, we are also investigating the possibility in using CRISPR/Cas13-mediated RNA editing technology to develop therapeutics for HERDA in affected horses. 32The Rabbit as Experimental Model for Studying the Function of Genes Using the New Genome Editing Technologies: The Example of responsible for the synthesis of oestrogens in vertebrates. In adults, AROMATASE gene is expressed mainly in gonads but also in adipose tissue, bone, muscular tissue and brain. In most mammals (but not in mice) there is a peak of expression of the aromatase gene only in the foetal XX gonad when sexual differentiation starts up. Our goal was to elucidate the role of this early peak of AROMATASE expression. This question is particularly relevant since, in some mammals, the FOXL2 gene, which is a major determinant of ovarian differentiation, is an activator of transcription of the AROMATA SE gene. We thus produced genetically edited rabbits by using a TALEN specifically targeting the translation start site of the AROMATASE gene. Three lines of mutant rabbits were derived from 6 founders, with deletions from 339 to 829 bp length surrounding the position of the translation start site. The phenotype of animals was similar in the three lines. Heterozygous rabbits ( ARO +/-) presented a normal phenotype. Homozygous XY animals developed as males and were fertile; (ARO-/-) XX animals developed as females but were totally infertile. Gonads of XX ARO-/- foetuses developed as ovaries, but were significantly smaller than those of normal rabbits. In adults, the size of the genital tract of XX ARO -/- was extremely reduced. The histological and immunohistological analyses showed that from foetal life, the number of germ cells was drastically reduced. Interestingly, germ cells engaged meiosis as in normal animals and all classes of follicles were visible from primordial to large antral follicles. However, the number of follicles from all types was extremely low. Primordial follicles were almost absent few months after birth indicating the loss of follicular reserve. Moreover, ovulation did not occur . Finally, this work shows that the foetal surge of oestrogens in the rabbit gonad of the XX foetus is responsible for the high number of germ cells and that later on oestrogens are mandatory for ovulation. However, oestrogens are essential neither for differentiation of the foetal gonad as an ovary, nor for meiosis or differentiation of follicles. 33Generation of Adeline N. Boettcher, Blythe Schultz, Zoe E. Kiefer, Sara Charley, Wei Wang, Crystal Loving, Christopher K. Tuggle, Jason W. Ross Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) is defined as the lack or impairment of the adaptive immune system in humans. Pigs are an excellent biomedical animal model because of their similarity in physiology and immunology to humans. The SCID pig offers valuable insight into research areas such as regenerative medicine, cancer therapy and immune cell signaling mechanisms. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a knockout of the Interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) -/Y in an Artemis (ART)-/- background to produce a double mutant (DM) SCID pig that lacks T cells, B cells and NK cells. Male ART-/- porcine fetal fibroblasts (pFF) were obtained from an embryonic day 35 fetus which was produced by inseminating ART +/- sows with semen from a bone marrow transfer rescued ART-/- boar. Guide RNA targeting exon 5 of IL2RG was designed and cloned into a humanized Cas9 plasmid. Following pFF cell transfection and in vitro culture, five IL2RG -/Y cell lines were identified from a total of 202 individual clonal colonies screened using PCR and sequencing. Using one of the modified male cell lines, a total of 920 somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos were transferred surgically to the oviducts of seven recipient gilts . One surrogate has produced three live male piglets via cesarean section that are being reared in a SCID pig bubble, which provides a clean, pathogen-free environment. Genotyping results obtained from newborn piglet ear notch samples confirmed a 120 nucleotide deletion involving intron 4 and exon 5 and causing a frameshift mutation in the IL2RG gene. Peripheral blood was collected from all three piglets at postnatal day 1 and day 7. Complete blood count data showed that lymphocyte cells were lacking in the IL2RG/ART DM pigs when compared to normal pigs. Compared to ART +/- pigs with an intact immune system, flow cytometry analysis showed that B cells, T cells and NK cells were completely depleted in peripheral blood of DM pigs demonstrating that ablation of IL2RG-/Y and ART-/- effectively produces SCID pigs lacking these three immune cell types.

Collier1, Peter Welsh1, Tracy Habermehl1, Kate C. Parkinson1 and Jeffrey B. Mason1 1Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences, Center for Integrated BioSystems, School of Veterinary Medicine, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA. Reproductive efficiency is widely regarded as the most limiting factor to profitability in animal production systems. A major contributor to reproductive failure in mammals is the continuous activation, and subsequent atresia of large numbers of primordial follicles, even during pregnancy, seasonal anestrous and prepubertally. Decreased ovarian reserve also negatively impacts follicular function, oocyte quality and pregnancy rates in cattle. 34Our goal is to produce livestock that will become reproductively mature and pregnant, with the option to 'shut off' the continuous activation of oocytes that would otherwise be destined for atresia. Oocytes will remain quiescent until needed for production of offspring. This will preserve these oocytes for later life, turning on oocyte activation only when desired to initiate another pregnancy. This extension of reproductive potential will increase life span and health and the production of offspring and products from the animal. A model used previously in our lab to extend reproductive potential has been the transplantation of new ovaries to postreproductive females. This method has been reliably effective at extending life span and health, without the negative effects seen with nutrient restriction, but is only practical in a laboratory setting. We plan to introduce germ cell-silencing transgenes using a recombinant adeno-associated (rAAV) viral vector. Transgenes include constitutively nuclear Foxo3a and Foxo1 under the control of a Tet-off promoter. Ovarian somatic cells have also been isolated and transduced ex vivo with both Foxo genes and are scheduled for transplantation this June. In previous work, in vivo injection of rAAVs resulted in year-long transgene expression and protein production restricted to the injected tissues in rodent and large animal models. Pilot experiments in sheep ovaries suggest that intra-arterial vector injection into the ovarian artery may be the preferred approach proposed for use in larger animals. In vivo rAAV transduction of adult rodent ovaries resulted in transgene expression in germ and somatic cells in histological ovary sections and in ovulated oocytes. expect up-regulation of the Foxo3a and Foxo1 signaling pathways to render germ cells quiescent and that the addition of doxycycline will reinitiate oocyte maturation, cyclicity and ovulation in treated females. Comparison of Gene Editing vs. Conventional Breeding to Introduce the POLLED Allele into the U.S. Dairy Cattle Population Maci L. Mueller 1, John B. Cole2, Tad S. Sonstegard3, Alison L. Van Eenennaam1 1Department of Animal Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA; 2United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, USA; 3Acceligen, St. Paul, MN, USA Dehorning is a standard cattle management practice to protect animals and humans from injury. It is an unpleasant, costly process subject to increased public scrutiny as an animal welfare issue. Horns are a recessively inherited trait, so one option to eliminate dehorning is to breed for polled (hornlessness). However, due to the low genetic merit and scarcity of polled dairy sires, this approach has not been widely adopted. In March 2018, there were only three Holstein (HO) and zero Jersey (JE) active homozygous polled sires registered with the National Association of Animal Breeders (NAAB). Alternatively, gene editing to produce high genetic merit polled sires has been proposed. To further explore this concept, introgression of the POLLED allele into both the United States HO and JE populations via conventional breeding or gene editing (1% of bulls/year) was simulated for three polled mating schemes and compared to baseline selection on lifetime net merit (NM$) alone, over the course of 20 years. Scenarios were replicated ten times and changes in HORNED allele frequency, inbreeding and genetic gain were calculated. Gene 35editing decreased the frequency of HORNED to < 0.6 in 5 years, which was faster ( P 0.01) than conventional breeding for both breeds. When breeds were required to use only existing homozygous polled sires, inbreeding reached 17% (HO) and 14% (JE), compared to less than 7% in the baseline scenario. However, gene editing in the same mating scheme resulted in significantly less inbreeding, (9% HO; P < 0.01 and 8% JE; P < 0.01). Additionally, gene editing resulted in a significantly increased average rate of genetic gain in both breeds ($15 - $33 per year; P < 0.01) compared to conventional breeding. Overall, our simulations show that, given the current genetic merit of horned and polled dairy sires, the use of conventional breeding methods to decrease the frequency of HORNED will significantly increase inbreeding and slow genetic improvement. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how gene editing could alternatively be used to rapidly decrease the frequency of HORNED and maintain acceptable levels of inbreeding and rates of genetic gain, while addressing animal welfare concerns. Targeted Double Knockout of ST3GAL1 and ST6GAL1 G enes by Injection and Bhanu P. Telugu1,2,3 1 University of Maryland, Animal and Avian Sciences, College Park, MD, USA; 2 USDA -ARS, Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, USA; 3 RenOVAte Biosciences, Reisterstown, USA Influenza A virus (IAV) of the Orthomyxoviridae family is \"an ancient and persistent threat\" to human and animal health. Annually, seasonal influenza is responsible for up to 41,000 human fatalit ies in United States and upward of 500,000 casualties globally. Besides the human health concerns, influenza in pigs ranks consistently among the top three economic diseases of swine industry affecting the breeding, nursery and finishing herds. -galactoside 2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (ST3GAL1) and -galactoside 2,6-sialyltransferase 1 ( that plays a major role in 2,3- and 2,6-sialyl modifications of cell surface glycoproteins that are crucial for human and swine IAV entry. With the availability of CRISPRs we tested the ability to knockout both ST3GAL1 and ST6GAL1 genes . To produce pigs with knockout of both ST3GAL1 and ST6GAL1 gene, donor animals were estrous synchronized, artificially inseminated, and in vivo fertilized zygotes surgically recovered. The in vivo fertilized zygotes were microinjected with a mixture of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and 70 zygotes were transferred into each of the synchronized recipient gilt. The recipient from the embryo transfer was confirmed pregnant and on day 53, a total of 8 fetuses (2 males and 6 females) were recovered. Genotyping of ear notch biopsies of PCR amplicons by Fragment analyzer and Sanger sequencing identified that all piglets were edited, and with no wildtype animals. The clonal lines are currently being expanded for viral challenge studies. Our study suggests that Cas9 RNP as an ideal option for generation of genetically modified animal models. 36Sex Determination of Bos Taurus Using ZRSR2 and ZRSR2Y Gene Homologs Evan Peterson1, Miriam T. Laker1, Lee F. Rickords1* 1 Department of Animal, Dairy, and Veterinary Science, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA *lee.rickords@usu.edu (Corresponding Author) A single PCR primer pair designed to produce an X-chromosome specific amplicon and a separate Y-chromosome specific amplicon has a distinct advantage in sex determination assays. Namely, the single primer set has a built-in control for the PCR reaction, which eliminates duplex PCR reaction inefficiencies. Primer sets of this kind generally target gene regions on the X chromosome that have homologs on the Y chromosome containing deletions or insertions. One example is the amelogenin (AMELX) gene. Primers spanning deletions in the amelogenin- like gene (AMELY) found on the Y chromosome have commonly been used for sex determination. However, in human amelogenin sex determining studies, it has been shown that males can be mis-identified with an error rate ranging from 0.018% to 10.96%. In an attempt to decrease this error rate, we have designed a PCR assay utilizing one primer pair targeting the ZRSR2 and ZRSR2Y genes in Bos taurus . Comparison of the Bos taurus ZRSR2 and ZRSR2Y gene sequences yielded multiple deletion regions located within the ZRSR2Y sequence. We designed a primer pair to span two of these deletions. DNA samples from Bos taurus breeds were analyzed utilizing theses primers and proved to be highly accurate in sex determination of all Bos taurus samples tested. Female samples produced a single X-chromosome specific ZRSR2 band, 149 bp in length, whereas male samples produced two bands, one X-chromosome specific ZRSR2 band (149 bp) and a second Y-chromosome specific ZRSR2Y specific band, 116 bp in length. This assay provides an efficient alternative assay for sex-determination in Bos taurus domestic cattle. Effect of Exercise and Pregnancy on Atrial Fibrillation Susceptibility in a TGF- b1 Transgenic Goat Model Misha Regouski1, Heloisa M. Rutigliano1, 2, Michael J. Cutler3, Irina A. Polejaeva1 1Department of Animal, Dairy, and Veterinary Sciences, Logan, UT, USA 2School of Veterinary Medicine, Utah State University, Logan, UT , USA 3Heart Institute, Intermountain Medical Center, Murray, UT , USA Extreme endurance exercise is shown to contribute to atrial fibrillation (AF). In limited case studies, AF increased during and immediately after parturition in patients previously diagnosed with the arrhythmia. In an effort to understand the effect of endurance exercise and pregnancy on AF two experiments were designed to evaluate the cardiac arrhythmia utilizing transgenic (TG) goats with an underlying cardiac myopathy. The TG goats express human TGF- b1 under a control of cardiac specific a-MHC (myosin heavy chain) promotor, which induces cardiac 37fibrosis leading to increased AF susceptibility. We hypothesized that episodes of AF would increase in these transgenic goats that underwent a regime of exercise or pregnancy and delivery of offspring. Six TG goats between 2 and 3 years of age and six w ild-type (WT) control goats at 3 years of age were used for this study. Dual chamber pacemakers were implanted and goats were allowed a 2-week recovery period. The exercise portion of this study was performed using a \"hot walker\" at different speeds and time intervals, beginning at 3 miles per hour (mph) for 25 minutes, and culminating at 4.5 mph for 90 minutes spanning a three-month period. AF inducibility of goats was tested via burst pacing every 2 weeks for the exercise period. Four TG goats and zero WT goats were inducible at baseline, AF episodes increased for the f irst 2 -months of exercise and seemed to stabilize toward baseline at month three (TG 67%; 100%' 83% TG goats developed self-terminating, spontaneous AF episodes around 2 months of exercise. At the completion of the exercise study five TG goats and six WT goats were bred to a TG buck and inducibility was tested monthly through gestation and kidding. AF inducibility remained at or below baseline for both animal groups until post-parturition where there was an increase in AF episodes. This is a novel finding in AF cases and may provide important insight regarding diagnosis and management of the arrhythmia. Targeted Mutation of NGN3 Gene Disrupts Pancreatic Endocrine Cell 1Department of and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland-College Park, MD.USA 2Agricultural Research Services, Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory, USDA, Beltsville, MD. USA 3RenOVAte Biosciences Inc, Reisterstown, MD 21136 USA The domestic pig is an attractive model for biomedical research because of similarities in anatomy and physiology to humans. However, key gaps remain in our understanding of the role of developmental genes in pig, limiting its full potential. In this publication, the role of NEUROGENIN 3 (NGN3 ), a transcription factor involved in endocrine pancreas development has been investigated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene ablation. Precomplexed Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting NGN3 were injected into in vivo derived porcine embryos, and transferred into surrogate females. On day 60 of pregnancy, nine fetuses were collected for genotypic and phenotypic analysis. One of the piglets was identified as an in-frame biallelic knockout ( 2/2), which showed target NEUROD1 and PAX4 glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide-Y. Fibroblasts from this fetus were used in somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate clonal animals to qualify the effect of mutation on embryonic lethality. Three live piglets were born, received colostrum and suckled normally, but experienced extreme weight loss over a 24 to 36-hour period requiring humane euthanasia. Expression of pancreatic endocrine hormones: insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were lost. The data support a critical role of NGN3 in porcine endocrine pancreas development. 38Trio -based Deep Sequencing Reveals Low Incidence of Off-target Mutations in the Genetically Edited Small China; 2Recombinetics, St. Paul, and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, China; 4Institute of Farm Animal Genetics, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Neustadt, 31535, Germany The simplicity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has enabled its widespread applications in generating animal models, functional genomic screening and in treating genetic and infectious diseases. However, off-target mutations produced by mis-guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease activity have a potential to cause unintended results. To address rate of off-targeting in small ruminants, we took advantage of our previously generated gene-edited sheep and goats, and performed trio-based whole genome sequencing which is capable of discriminating variants in the edited progenies that are inherited, naturally generated, or induced by genetic modification. A total of seven family trios, including edited animals and their offspring, were sequenced at a high coverage (25-36\u00d7). After developing a pipeline to comprehensively analyze the sequence data for de novo single nucleotide variants, indels and structural variations from the genome, we found that the incidence of de novo mutations (around 20 SNVs in each edited animal) in the both edited animals and their offspring is almost negligible. The natural mutation rates in edited animals and their progenies were equivalent to that in human, cattle and normal populations. We provide the first report on the fidelity of CRISPR-based modification for small ruminant genomes targeted simultaneously at multiple sequence locations. The trio-based sequencing approach revealed almost negligible off-target modifications, providing timely evidence of safe application of in vivo genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9. 39Antiviral Research Institute The Institute for Antiviral Research is a team of faculty, technicians and student researchers in the Department of Animal, Dairy and Veterinary Sciences (ADVS) focused on understanding and combatting viruses that have significant impacts on human health, including Zik a, West Nile, influenza, Middle East R espiratory Virus and S ARS. Since its founding in 197 7, institute researchers have been awarded more than $100 million in grants and contracts from agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and from private companies. Cures from (un)Common Animals T ransferring immunity from animals to help a human fight disease has been going on for centuries. There are downsides though as some people have adverse reactions to animal-derived antibodies. SAB Biotherapeutics' approach aims to avoid that pitfall because the engineered animals produce fully human antibodies. The company has a herd of cattle at its South Dakota \"pharm\" and two of its treatments are in clinical trials. An off-shoot of the company is in Utah, and work at Utah State University is helping to determine if goats that express human antibodies are viable animal models. Fighting Adenoviruses Animals are important to researchers in their efforts to understand how diseases work, an important step in prevention or developing treatments. But animals' physiology and chemistry isn't always a good match for how humans will react to a virus, bacteria or to potential treatments. Associate Professor Zhongde Wang and his research team genetically engineered the first hamsters to be useful as models for many human diseases that previously had no animal models, or models that were severely limited. Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of irregular heartbeat, affecting more than 2.7 million adults in the United States. \"A fib\" causes chest pain, fainting, rapid heartbeat, stroke, heart failure and other serious health problems. A team of researchers in ADVS have genetically engineered goats to help determine what makes some hearts more susceptible to atrial fibrillation, which could pave the way for developing better treatments.
