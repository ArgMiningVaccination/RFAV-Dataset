Naturopathic doctors receive specialized training in tools and a philosophy of medicine that: - Blend conventional with functional medicine testing options - Integrate time-honored natural medicine with modern scientific advances - Consider complex and multifactorial causes of illness - Offer multi-modality solutions to complex diseases or symptoms - Present individualized treatment plans unique to each patient - Engage and educate patients for their own health care empowerment - See disease and treatment as a process needing attention and care Naturopathic medicine is not a single treatment modality but instead a philosophy of the medical approach. The conventional treatment approach for many of our chronic illnesses often involve controlling symptoms with prescription medications. Born out of large hospital systems, this is an acute care model attempting to address complex problems of chronic disease. The naturopathic model believes that in order to address the current epidemics of chronic illness we need a dynamic, multi-factorial and patient-centered system. Each patient is treated as an individual and receives treatment recommendation specific to their individual needs. Naturopathic doctors provide patients with several options for their care and collaborate with the patient to determine the best treatment plan.

Naturopathic Doctors combine and tailor these treatments to the needs of the individual in a way that acknowledges the patient as a participant. Although all NDs are trained in all the following modalities, many choose to focus in some of the areas over others. Talk with your ND to find out what modalities they use most commonly.

Adopting a healthy diet is often the first step towards correcting health problems.

Lifestyle Counseling and Stress Management Mental attitudes and emotional states can be important elements in healing and disease. Naturopathic Doctors are trained in counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management, hypnotherapy, and biofeedback.
