Getting Your Questions About Vaccines Answered Do you want to know how to cleanse your child's body from the potential toxins from vaccinations they've had? Because every vaccine is full of toxins! Most of them still have things like mercury and aluminum which are very heavy neurotoxins that many kids don't have much of a barrier or ability to fight off. Vaccines are also full of other preservatives, MSG, aborted fetal cell tissues, and other toxins and preservatives that you would never normally put into your body. And you would, of course, never ever give to your kids. As the vaccine schedule gets increased to include more and more shots, we're seeing more problems with kids. - More neurodevelopmental problems. - More digestive problems - The highest onset of autism and other issues than we've ever seen before in the history.
