The basic works of [Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) came to Japan between the 7th and 9th centuries. [[1]](http://www.itmonline.org/arts/kampo.htm) Since then, the Japanese have created their own unique herbal medical system and diagnosis. Kampo uses most of the Chinese medical system including [acupuncture](/index.php/Acupuncture) and [moxibustion](/index.php/Moxibustion) but is primarily concerned with the study of [herbs](/index.php/Herbalism). Approved Kampo medicines Today in Japan, Kampo is integrated into the national health care system. In 1967, the [ Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](/index.php/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)) approved four kampo medicines for reimbursement under the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. In 1976, 82 kampo medicines were approved by the [ Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare](/index.php/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)). Currently, 148 kampo medicines are approved for reimbursement. [[2]](http://www.itmonline.org/arts/kampo.htm) Rather than modifying formulae as in [Traditional Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), the Japanese kampo tradition uses fixed combinations of herbs in standardized proportions according to the classical literature of Chinese medicine. Kampo medicines are produced by various manufacturers. However, each medicine is composed of exactly the same ingredients under the [ Ministry's](/index.php/Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)) standardization methodology. The medicines are therefore prepared under strict manufacturing conditions that rival pharmaceutical companies. The two leading companies making kampo medicines are Tsumura () and Kaneb (). [[3]](http://www.tsumura.co.jp/english/kampo/wik/resource.htm) Extensive modern scientific research in Japan has validated the effectiveness of kampo medicines. In October 2000, a nationwide study reported that 72% of registered [physicians](/index.php/Physician) prescribe kampo medicines. [[4]](http://www.paho.org/spanish/ad/ths/ev/PM-WHOTraditional_medicines_legal_status.pdf) Herbs used in kampo medicines The 14th edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) ( Nihon yakkyokuh) lists 165 herbal ingredients that are used in kampo medicines. [[5]](http://www.herbalgram.org/youngliving/herbclip/pdfs/041806-179.pdf) Tsumura () is the leading maker of kampo medicine. [[6]](http://www.tsumura.co.jp/english/kampo/wik/resource.htm) They make 128 of the 148 kampo medicines. The most common herb in kampo medicine is Glycyrrhizae Radix (Chinese liquorice root). It is in 94 of the 128 Tsumura formulae. Other common herbs are [Zingiberis Rhizoma](/index.php/Ginger) (ginger) 128 formulae) and peony root) (44 Japan In the [United States](/index.php/United_States), kampo is practiced mostly by acupuncturists, Chinese medicine practitioners, naturopath physicians, and other [alternative medicine](/index.php/Alternative_medicine) professionals. Kampo herbal formulae are studied under clinical trials, such as the clinical study of Sho-saiko-to (H09) for treatment of hepatitis C at [New York Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center](http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/2270.cfm?IRBNO=02-073) and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C at [UCSD Liver Center](http://health.ucsd.edu/ntrials/031532.htm). Both clinical trials are sponsored by [Honso USA, Inc.](http://www.honsousa.com), a branch of [Honso Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.](http://www.honzo.co.jp/company/gyoumu.html), Nagoya, Japan.
