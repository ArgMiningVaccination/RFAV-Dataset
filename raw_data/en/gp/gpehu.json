Set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sustainable Development Goals take over where the Millennium Development Goals before them left off\u2014and in many cases aim to finish the job. Eradi - cating poverty, an objective shared by the World Bank Group, is a key element of this unfinished business. It remains the world's greatest challenge. World Development Indicators will report on prog - ress toward the Sustainable Development Goals, as it did with the Millennium Development Goals. The Sustainable Development Goals cover a broader range of issues, and this edition expands coverage in the World view section. For each of the 17 goals, key indi - cators have been selected to identify important trends and challenges and elicit discussion on measurement issues. An accompanying set of dashboards, showing trends by country, region, and income level, are avail - able at http://data.worldbank.org/sdgs. Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and measuring and monitoring progress toward them will require much more data than are currently avail - able, with more accuracy, better timeliness, greater disaggregation, and higher frequency. The institu - tions fundamental to this effort should be supported through strong and renewed global partnerships. A new Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data was launched alongside Agenda 2030 in Sep - tember 2015 (see http://data4sdgs.org). A key aim is to bring different groups together to ignite a data revolution for development. Where possible, this edition of World Development Indicators includes new indicators to reflect the 169 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, but the structure of the book remains the same as in previous editions: World view, People, Environment, Economy, States and markets, and Global links. Each section includes a brief introduction, a global map of a key indicator, a table, a section about the data, and an index of other indicators accessible online. World view retains the two tables showing progress toward the World Bank Group's goals of eradicating poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Motivated by the universal agenda of the Sustain - able Development Goals, this edition of World Develop - ment Indicators also introduces a change in the way that global and regional aggregates are presented in tables and figures. Unless otherwise noted, there is no longer a distinction between developing countries (defined in previous editions as low- and middle-income countries) and developed countries (defined in previous editions as high-income countries). Regional groupings are based on geographical coverage rather than a sub - set of countries that were previously referred to as developing. Two implications of this change are that a new aggregate for North America has been included in tables, and aggregates for Europe and Central Asia include countries of the European Union. Aggregates restricted to low- and middle- income countries are still available in the World Development Indicators data - base at http://databank.worldbank.org/wdi. World Development Indicators is the result of a collaborative partnership of international agencies, statistical offices of more than 200 economies, and many more. I want to acknowledge their efforts and thank them for their tireless work, which is at the heart of development and the fight to eradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity. Haishan Fu Director Development Economics Data GroupPrefaceiv World Development Indicators 2016 Acknowledgments This book was prepared by a team led by Bala Bhas- kar Naidu Kalimili under the management of Haruna Kashiwase, ant Tariku, Dereje Wolde, and Junhe Yang, working closely with other teams in the Development Economics Vice Presi - dency's Development Data Group.

Partners Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations. The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and household surveys to the committees and working parties of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the nomenclature, classifications, and standards funda - mental to an international statistical system. Non - governmental organizations and the private sector have also made important contributions, both in gath - ering primary data and in organizing and publishing their results. And academic researchers have played a crucial role in developing statistical methods and carrying on a continuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statistical indicators. All these contributors have a strong belief that available, accu - rate data will improve the quality of public and private decision making. The organizations listed here have made World Development Indicators possible by sharing their data and their expertise with us. More important, their col - laboration contributes to the World Bank's efforts, and to those of many others, to improve the quality of life of the world's people. We acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all who have helped to build a base of comprehensive, quantitative information about the world and its people.

The database contains more than 1,300 time series indicators for 214 economies and more than 30 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years. The 2016 edition of World Development Indicators offers a condensed presentation of the principal indica - tors, arranged in their traditional sections, along with regional and topical highlights and maps. World view People Environment Economy States and markets Global links Tables The tables include all World Bank member countries (188), and all other economies with populations of more than 30,000 (214 total). Countries and economies are listed alphabetically (except for Hong Kong SAR, China, and Macao SAR, China, which appear after China). The term country, used interchangeably with economy, does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics. When available, aggregate measures for income and regional groups appear at the end of each table. Aggregate measures for income groups Aggregate measures for income groups include the 214 economies listed in the tables, plus Taiwan, China, when - ever data are available. To maintain consistency in the aggregate measures over time and between tables, miss - ing data are imputed where possible. Aggregate measures for regions The aggregate measures for regions cover economies at all income levels, unless otherwise noted. The country composition of regions may differ from common geographic usage. For regional classifications, see the map on the inside back cover and the list on the back cover flap. For further discussion of aggregation methods, see Sources and methods.Data presentation conventions A blank means not applicable or, for an aggregate, not analytically meaningful. A billion is 1,000 million. A trillion is 1,000 billion. Figures in green italics refer to years or periods other than those specified or to growth rates calculated for less than the full period specified. Data for years that are more than three years from the range shown are footnoted. The cutoff date for data is February 1, 2016.World Development Indicators 2016 xiii Economy States and markets Global links Back World Development Indicators 2016 87 Economy States and markets Global links BackEnvironment 3 DeforestationaNationally protected areasInternal renewable freshwater resourcesbAccess to improved water sourceAccess to improved sanitation facilitiesUrban populationAmbient PM 2.5 air pollutionCarbon dioxide emissionsEnergy use Electricity production Terrestrial and marine areas % of total territorial areaPopulation- weighted exposure micrograms per cubic meteraverage annual %Per capita cubic meters% of total population% of total population % growthmillion metric tonsPer capita kilograms of oil equivalentbillion kilowatt hours 2000-15 2014 2014 2015 2015 2013-14 2013 2011 2013 2013 Costa Rica -1.07 3.1 23,751 98 95 2.4 9 7.8 1,029 10.2 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire -0.05 14.9 3,468 82 23 3.8 20 6.4 605 7.6 Croatia -0.13 23.7 8,895 100 97 0.1 14 20.6 1,814 13.3 Cuba -2.09 5.0 3,350 95 93 0.3 676 100 100 0.9 16 7.5 1,691 4.3 Czech Republic -0.08 21.1 1,249 100 99 0.0 17 109.5 3,990 86.2 Denmark -0.30 18.0 1,064 100 100 0.6 11 40.4 3,107 34.7 Djibouti 0.00 1.1 342 90 47 1.4 .. ..

Because GNI per capita changes over time, the country composition of income groups may change from one edition of World Development Indicators to the next. Once the classification is fixed for an edition, based on GNI per capita in the most recent year for which data are available (2014 in this edition), all historical data presented are based on the same country grouping. Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,045 or less in 2014. Lower middle-income econo - mies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,046-$4,125. Upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $4,126-$12,735. High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,736 or more. Statistics Data are shown for economies as they were constituted in 2014, and historical data have been revised to reflect current political arrangements. Exceptions are noted in the tables. Additional information about the data is provided in Sources and methods, which summarizes national and international efforts to improve basic data collection and gives country-level information on primary sources, census years, fiscal years, statistical concepts used, and other background information.

This is the first edition of World Development Indicators to include a discussion of the Sustainable Devel - opment Goals, which replaces the assessment of progress toward the Millennium Development Goals in previous editions. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 associated targets build on the 8 goals and 18 targets of the Millennium Development Goals but are far wider in scope and far more ambi - tious. They focus on five themes: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. Countries have resolved to end poverty and hunger and ensure that all people can fulfill their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environ - ment; to protect the planet from degradation and take urgent action on climate change; to ensure that all people can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that progress takes place in harmony with nature; to foster peaceful, just, and inclu - sive societies free from fear and violence; and to mobilize the means to implement Agenda 2030, focused on the poorest and most vulnerable, through strong global partnership. Along with the goals and targets, a global mon - itoring framework with more than 200 indicators is being developed by UN member states, working closely with UN agencies and other stakeholders. For each goal, World view presents recent trends and baselines against key targets, largely using indicators available in the World Development Indicators database and drawing on the specialist knowledge of World Bank staff. Some indicators have been added, and in some cases data have been used from published studies or reports. An interactive presentation of key indicators for assessing the Sustainable Development Goals is available at http://data.worldbank.org/sdgs. As in previous editions, World view also pres - ents indicators that measure progress toward the World Bank Group's twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and enhancing shared prosperity in every country, which are also cen - tral elements of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere) and 10 (reduce inequality within and among coun - tries). A major change is that the estimates of global and national extreme poverty rates have been updated to the international poverty line of $1.90 a day per person, in 2011 purchasing power parity terms. Estimates of indicators of shared prosperity for 94 countries, including the growth rates of the average income of the bot - tom 40 percent, are also included. Measuring and monitoring progress against the Millennium Development Goals were major challenges and required substantial efforts on the part of national statistical agencies and oth - ers to improve the quality, frequency, and avail - ability of relevant statistics. With a new, broader set of goals, targets, and indicators, the data requirements are even greater. Baselines and progress for few Sustainable Development Goal targets can be measured completely. Both gov - ernments and development partners will need to continue investing in national statistical systems and other relevant public institutions, where much of the data will continue to originate. At the same time, the statistical community needs to strengthen partnerships with the private sec - tor and other emerging actors for advancing new techniques of data collection, analysis, and use.2 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ?End poverty in all its forms everywhereIn 2012, 13 percent of the world's population lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day, down from 37 percent in 1990. Declines in all regions contributed to the early success of meeting the Millennium Development Goal target of halving extreme poverty globally. Sustain - able Development Goal 1 builds on this and proposes ending poverty in all forms by 2030. It also aims to ensure social protection for poor and vulnerable people, to increase access to basic services, and to support people harmed by conflict and climate-related disasters. Eradicating extreme poverty Many countries have made dramatic progress in reducing extreme poverty, though the global totals tend to be dominated by reductions in the two largest countries, China and India. In East Asia and Pacific the extreme poverty rate fell from 61 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2012, and in South Asia it fell from 51 percent to 19 percent (figure 1a). In contrast, Sub- Saharan Africa's extreme poverty rate did not fall below its 1990 level until 2002. Based on national growth rates over the past 10 years, the global extreme poverty rate is estimated to be below 10 percent in 2015, a drop of more than two-thirds since 1990. The Sustainable Development Goal tar - get of eliminating extreme poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is very ambitious. If national growth rates for the past 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate will fall to 4 percent by 2030, with variations across regions (figure 1b), and if national growth rates for the past 20 years prevail, it will be around 6 percent. 1 Eliminating extreme poverty will require a step change from historical growth rates. Reducing poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitionsLike the Millennium Development Goals, the Sustainable Development Goals recognize that poverty is defined differently by national authori - ties. Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to halve poverty rates based on these national defi - nitions (target 1.2).

More recently, some countries \u2014 such as Colombia and Mexico \u2014 have adopted measures that aim to cap - ture the multidimensional nature of poverty by assessing the extent to which households are deprived in different ways (such as health, edu - cation, housing, and labor market opportunities). Increasing social protection for those most in needSocial protection programs include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding, and targeted food assistance, and social insurance and labor market programs, such as old-age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills training, and wage subsidies. Improving coverage of social protection programs and targeting appropriate schemes to the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty (target 1.3). Despite progress over the past decade, most poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low-income countries. Only one out of five people receives one or more types of social protection benefit in low-income countries, compared with two out of three in upper middle-income countries (figure 1c). The coverage gap is particularly acute in Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia, where most of the world's extremely poor people live. In Sub- Saharan Africa only 15 percent of people in the bottom income quintile have access to a social protection benefit (figure 1d). Average social assistance cash benefits account for only 10 percent of poor people's consumption in low-income countries, 21 per - cent in lower middle-income countries, and 37 percent in upper middle-income countries. Overall, social assistance transfers are not large enough to close the poverty gap in the poorest countries. Note 1. Ferreira, F. H.

The prevalence of undernourishment, where food intake does not meet continuous dietary energy requirements, has been almost halved globally, from 19 percent to 11 percent, but remains far higher in low-income countries than elsewhere (figure 2a). Efforts to end hunger by 2030 (target 2.1) will not be successful if current trends con - tinue. Improvements in food security and sustainable agriculture, espe - cially in cereal yields, can help. Improving nutrition Consistent with the World Health Assembly's Global Nutrition Targets 2025, 1 Sustainable Development Goal 2 focuses on both child - hood malnutrition and the nutritional needs of adolescent girls and pregnant women, along with older people (target 2.2). Anthropomet - ric indices, including stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and over - weight (high weight for height) in children under age 5, are common indicators of nutrition. The prevalence of child stunting has declined in all income groups since 1990 but remains close to 40 percent in low-income countries and above 30 percent in lower middle-income countries (figure 2b). Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to reduce the number of children under age 5 who are stunted by 40 percent by 2025 (target 2.2). In countries where the number of children under age 5 is likely to grow, achieving this involves both reducing the number and the prevalence of stunted children. Supporting food security and sustainable agricultureRaising the agricultural productivity of poor households will be central to ending hunger by 2030 (targets 2.3 and 2.4). In low-income coun - tries changes in poverty and undernourishment have been closely related to changes in agricul - tural productivity \u2014 and in particular to changes in cereal yields. In periods of stagnant agricul - tural productivity growth, as experienced by low-income countries from 1990 to 1999, poor people saw little improvement in wealth and nutritional health. But they have seen benefits End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agricultureSDG 2 Zero hunger 0204060 2014 2010 2005 2000 1995 1990Prevalence of child stunting (% of children under age 5) Low income Lower middle income Upper middle income High incomeWorldPrevalence of child stunting is falling but is close to 40 percent in low-income countries 2b Source: United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, and World Bank, 2015, Levels and Trends in Child Malnutrition, New York; World Development Indicators database (SH.STA.STNT.ZS).01020304050 2015 2010 2005 2000 1995 1991Prevalence of undernourishment (% of population) Low income Lower middle income Upper middle incomeWorldUndernourishment has declined globally but remains high in low-income countries 2a Note: Data refer to the middle year of three-year intervals.

Between 2000 and 2012 the average annual growth rate of cereal yields in low-income countries was 2.6 percent; over the same period both poverty and undernourishment fell 2.7 percent a year (figure 2c). A similar directional pattern exists for lower and upper middle-income countries, though the proportional impacts vary. By 2030, population growth, and hence food demand, is projected to increase the most in the poorest parts of the world. These are also the regions where agricultural productivity is lowest (figure 2d) and where vulnerability to climate change is high. Further gains in agri - cultural productivity and climate resilience are needed, particularly in low-income countries, to raise poor people's incomes and feed growing populations. Note 1.

In middle- and high-income countries the pattern is different: More than two-thirds die from noncommunicable diseases. Sustainable Development Goal 3 focuses on improving well-being, especially at the most vulnerable stages of life, providing health services, and improving imbalances between poorer and richer countries. Targeting a range of health impacts The Millennium Development Goals focused on improving health conditions in low- and middle-income countries, covering maternal mortality, child mortality, infectious diseases, and sexual and reproductive health. Sustainable Develop - ment Goal 3 introduces additional targets for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, substance abuse, injuries, universal health cov - erage, and pollution. 1 Reducing maternal mortalityThe global maternal mortality ratio declined dra - matically between 1990 and 2015, from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births to 216 (figure 3a). Despite this 44 percent decline, the Millennium Development Goal target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters was not met. The decline will need to accelerate considerably for the global maternal mortality ratio to fall below 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030 (target 3.1). Providing mothers with skilled attendants at delivery and access to hospital treatments is key to treating life-threatening emergencies. Worldwide, the proportion of births attended by skilled health staff increased from 60 per - cent in 2000 to 68 percent in 2011. However only half of births are attended in low-income countries. Providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health careSustainable Development Goal 3 aims to ensure universal access to sexual and repro - ductive health care services (target 3.7).

The ado - lescent fertility rate has been declining world - wide but remains high in low-income countries, at 98 births per 1,000 women ages 15-19 (figure 3b). Ending preventable childhood deaths In 2015 the global under-five mortality rate in 2015 was less than half the rate in 1990, fall - ing just short of the Millennium Development Goal target of a two-thirds reduction (figure 3c). 2 Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under age 5 and to reduce the under-five mor - tality rate in every country to below 25 deaths per 1,000 births (target 3.2). For this to hap - pen, progress needs to accelerate especially in many low-income and lower middle-income countries.Reducing noncommunicable diseases and injuriesSustainable Development Goal 3 also aims to reduce deaths and adverse consequences of noncommunicable diseases and injuries (tar - get 3.6). Traffic injuries caused 27 deaths per 100,000 people in low-income countries in 2013, three times more than in high-income countries (figure 3d). There are challenges for monitoring nearly all the targets. Gaps exist because the key data sources, such as civil registration and vital statistics systems, are weak in many low- and middle-income countries, as are health informa - tion systems. Notes 1.

But the gross tertiary enrollment ratio remains around 30 percent. Increased access to higher education is needed to achieve a productive, talented, and diverse labor force and an empowered citizenry. Sustainable Development Goal 4 also focuses on education quality, proficiency in key subjects at various ages, and access to modern education facilities. Attending and completing school Considerable progress has been made since 1990 as more students enroll and finish pri - mary school (target 4.1). The primary comple - tion rate increased from 81 percent in 1990 to 92 percent in 2013 worldwide, and East Asia and Pacific and Europe and Central Asia have achieved or are close to achieving universal pri-mary education. Sub- Saharan Africa still lags behind the rest of the world, despite a substan - tial increase in the region's primary completion rate to 69 percent in 2013 (figure 4a). While many children enroll in school, some never attend, attend intermittently, or start but drop out entirely. In 2013, 59 million pri - mary school-age children were not in school, a substantial decrease from the 102 million in 1990 (figure 4b). This reflects great progress considering the number of primary school-age children increased 14 percent over the same period, which placed further pressure on national education systems. Gross enrollment ratios at all levels of edu - cation have risen globally, but wide variations remain between rich and poor countries. For example, children in high-income countries were almost five times more likely than children in low-income countries to have entered pre-primary school in 2013 (target 4.2; figure 4c). The trend is similar for tertiary gross enrollment (target 4.3).

Students' understanding of core subjects is fundamental to well functioning education systems (targets 4.1 and 4.6), and though not wholly comparable, regional assessments shed light on countries' achievements in these areas. The Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems assessment in Sub- Saharan Africa showed that only half of grade 5 students achieved the minimum learning goal in mathematics. The Trends in Interna - tional Mathematics and Science Study showed that around 80 percent of grade 4 students in mainly Europe and Central Asia and Middle East and North Africa achieved the low international benchmark for mathematics. Assessments of adolescents' learning out - comes have shown that around 30 percent of students worldwide fail to achieve minimum mathematics proficiency, according to the Pro - gramme for International Student Assessment and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study for grade 8 students (figure 4d). Students who do not achieve the lowest level of proficiency by age of 14 or 15 are unlikely to master the skills by the end of schooling and therefore may not be ready for work.Addressing data challengesWhile many indicators and proxies exist to mon - itor many of the education targets under Sus - tainable Development Goal 4, more are needed. There is a conceptual challenge in developing global indicators for target 4.4, which stipulates \"by 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneur - ship.\" Countries will need to define relevant skills suitable for their own job market struc - ture and economic situation and set up robust and timely data collection systems to populate these indicators.

Half of women are economically active, compared with over three-quarters of men. On top of limited eco - nomic opportunities, women often have restricted agency \u2014 their ability to make decisions about their lives and to act on those decisions. While women and girls usually bear the direct costs of inequalities, gender bias has a cost to all, reducing the pace of development. Identifying obstacles to equality Sustainable Development Goal 5 explicitly recog - nizes gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and sets ambitious targets for ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls, eliminating all forms of violence and harmful practices, improving economic empower - ment and access to productive assets and tech - nologies, and enhancing the female voice and decision-making power beyond the Millennium Development Goal's focus on education. Empowering women's economic opportunities Increasing women's income-earning opportuni - ties and their access to productive assets pro - vides a direct pathway out of poverty. Economic empowerment can also give women voice and agency to manage their own money and make decisions for themselves and their family.Legal frameworks that protect men and women equally are an important first step toward gender equality, but discriminatory laws persist. Around 60 percent of countries lack legislation that ensures equal opportunities in hiring practices, requires equal remuneration for work of equal value, or allows women to perform the same jobs as men. While almost all coun - tries mandate maternity leave, almost half do not guarantee mothers an equivalent position on their return, discriminating against women who become pregnant and want to come back to work after the birth of a child (figure 5a).

These jobs are often inse - cure, do not provide any contractual security or benefits, and offer limited opportunities for career advancement and higher wages. Firm ownership and management are also dominated by men. Worldwide, 83 percent of firms have a man as a top manager, and 66 per-cent of firms have no female participation in their ownership (figure 5c). Access to financial services is another vehi - cle of economic empowerment, allowing women to borrow and save to start a business, cope with economic shocks, and invest in their fam - ily's future. But in many countries women face more barriers than men do in opening a bank account, such as the need for a male family member's permission, a lack of documenta - tion to prove identity, and lack of information. Worldwide, 57 percent of women held their own account at a financial institution in 2014, com - pared with 64 percent of men. Ending violence against women and girls Target 5.2 calls for eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls. Worldwide, an estimated one in three women has expe - rienced physical or sexual violence or both at the hands of a husband, boyfriend, or partner. 1 Rates of violence vary widely across countries, but such violence occurs in all regions, regard - less of income or education level. 2 Reliable sta - tistics are hard to collect, and rates are often underestimated. Eliminating child, early, and forced marriage Eliminating child, early, and forced marriage is a focus of target 5.3. Child marriage pushes girls into adulthood before they are mature 3: Young brides often drop out of school, have more chil-dren (figure 5d), face higher health risks during pregnancy and childbirth, and suffer more bar - riers to obtaining a higher paid job and gaining financial independence. All this leads to a lack of voice and agency. Although child marriage is prohibited by law in the majority of countries, one in four women ages 20-24 is married by age 18. 4 Notes 1.

Just over a quarter of people in low-income countries have access to an improved sanitation facility, compared with just over half in lower middle-income countries. Delivery of water supply and sanita - tion is not just a challenge of service provision; it is intrinsically linked with climate change, water resources management, water scarcity, and water quality. Ensuring access to an improved water source and improved sanitation facilitiesIn many countries, economic and population growth as well as urbanization have increased water demand while supply has remained unchanged or even decreased due to climate change. Although 2.6 billion people have gained access to an improved water source since 1990, dwindling supplies of safe drinking water remain a global problem. More than $250 bil - lion in GDP is lost every year in low- and middle-income countries because of inadequate water supply and sanitation services. 1 Sustainable Development Goal 6 recognizes that sustainably managing water goes beyond simply providing a safe water supply and sanita - tion to include the environment, human health, food security, disaster resilience, and ultimately economic growth. Easing access to drinking water Sustainable Development Goal 6 encompasses a call for drinking water for all (target 6.1). In 2015, 91 percent of the world's population had access to an improved water source, exceed - ing the Millennium Development Goal target of 88 percent. However, more than 660 mil - lion people still lack access to clean water, the majority of them in rural areas, predominantly in Sub- Saharan Africa (figure 6a). Even for those who have access to water, service is often inad - equate or unsustainable, and water from an improved source can still be unsafe to drink. 2Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for allSDG 6 Clean water and sanitation Share of population with access to an improved source of water, 2015 (%) 0255075100 World Sub-Saharan AfricaLatin America & CaribbeanMiddle East & North AfricaSouth AsiaEast Asia & Paci/f_icEurope & Central AsiaUrban RuralRural dwellers in Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to an improved source of water 6a Source: World Health Organization-United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation; World Development Indicators database (SH.H2O.SAFE.UR.ZS, SH.H2O.SAFE.RU.ZS).0255075100 2015 2010 2005 2000 1995 1990Share of population with access to improved sanitation facilities (%) Low incomeLower middle incomeWorldHigh income Upper middle income Millennium Development Goal target for low-income countriesMillennium Development Goal target for lower middle-income countriesOnly 68 percent of the world's population has access to improved sanitation facilities 6b Source: World Health Organization-United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation; World Development Indicators database (SH.STA.ACSN).World Development Indicators 2016 13 Economy States and markets Global links Back Improving access to sanitation facilities Only 68 percent of the world's population has access to improved sanitation facilities, falling short of the Millennium Development Goal tar - get of 77 percent (figure 6b). Sustainable Devel - opment Goal 6 aims to ensure adequate sanita - tion for all and to end open defecation (target 6.2), which contaminates water and spreads diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, and dysen - tery. Around 842,000 people a year die from diarrhea as a result of unsafe drinking water, sanitation, or hygiene. 3 Seven out of ten people who lack access to safe and hygienic toilet facil - ities live in rural areas, mostly in Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia. Balancing water demand with available resourcesMany countries face the threat of water scar - city, prompting calls for efficient water use (tar - get 6.4). Demand for water continues to grow, while global per capita freshwater supplies have been nearly halved over the past 50 years. Today, the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia are classified as water stressed-regions, with less than 1,700 cubic meters of water available per year per person (figure 6c). Climate change is expected to exacerbate the situation by raising water stress in arid regions and increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events. In 2030 half the world's population is projected to live in high water-stress regions. 4 Increasing water withdrawals for agriculture and energy generation will exacerbate com - petition for water use. The agricultural sector accounts for over 70 percent of global fresh - water withdrawals (figure 6d). By 2050 feeding a planet of 9 billion people will require a 15 per - cent increase in water withdrawals for agricul - ture. 5 Similarly, water withdrawals for energy generation are projected to grow 20 percent.6 Notes 1.

Access to energy is fundamental to development, but as economies evolve, rising incomes and growing populations demand more energy. Meeting Sustain - able Development Goal 7 will require increasing access to electricity, the take-up of clean fuels and renewable energies, and energy efficiency. Achieving universal access Universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services is critical to sustain - able development (target 7.1). Energy, espe - cially electricity, is crucial to improving the standard of living for people in low- and middle-income countries. It is key to providing reliable and efficient lighting, heating, cooking, and mechanical power; to delivering clean water, sanitation, and healthcare; and to operating well functioning transport and telecommunica - tions services. Modern energy services are cen - tral to the economic development of a country and to the welfare of its citizens. Without such services, businesses stagnate, and the poten - tial of people to live healthy, productive lives is diminished. Improvements over the past two decades led to 85 percent of the world enjoying access to electricity in 2012. Nevertheless, around 1.1 billion people are still without. In Sub- Saharan Africa only 35 percent of the popula - tion has access to electricity, the lowest among all regions (figure 7a). Almost 40 percent of the world's population relies primarily on wood, coal, charcoal, or animal waste to cook their food, breathing in toxic smoke that causes lung disease and kills nearly 4 million people a year, most of them women and children. 1 Using renewable energyWhile the share of energy use from alternative, cleaner sources has increased since 1970 in all income groups, fossil fuels account for around 81 percent of the world's energy use. Countries need to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix (tar - get 7.2) from its current small share of 18 per - cent (figure 7b).

Modern biomass and hydropower are important modern renew - able energy sources, each accounting for 3-4 percent of total final energy consumption. Other modern renewables (such as biomass, geothermal, wind, and solar) \u2014 currently around 1 percent of total consumption \u2014 have substan - tial potential for growth. The share of renew - able energy varies widely across the globe. It is falling in lower income regions as they switch from traditional biomass to more modern fuels for cooking and heating. By contrast, higher income regions are gradually shifting toward renewable energy sources, albeit from a low base (figure 7c). Increasing energy efficiency Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls on countries to collectively double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and technological progress and a shift away from energy-intensive activities can support this (tar - get 7.3). The energy intensity level of primary energy \u2014 the ratio of energy supply to GDP in purchasing power parity terms \u2014 indicates energy efficiency, or how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output. Between 1990 and 2012 the ratio declined 27 percent glob - ally as energy efficiency improved in all income groups (figure 7d), which helped keep total final energy consumption a third lower than it would otherwise have been. The coverage of energy efficiency regulations in industry, buildings, and transport has nearly doubled, from 14 percent of the world's energy consumption in 2005 to 27 percent in 2014. Still much more needs to be done. Note 1. Sustainable Energy for All (www.se4all.org).

And growth drives development. By leveraging labor, individuals and house - holds have a sustainable pathway out of poverty. Yet more than 200 million people were unemployed in 2015, and many more were underemployed in low-productivity informal sector jobs. Some 600 million new jobs need to be created by 2030, just to keep pace with the rising population. 1 Sus- tainable Development Goal 8 aims for higher economic productivity and at least 7 percent annual GDP growth in the least developed countries. Increasing growth in the least developed countries Of the 48 UN-classified least developed coun - tries in 2015, 23 are classified as fragile by the World Bank. The fragility of a country impacts its growth: Between 2000 and 2014 GDP growth in countries in fragile or conflict situations averaged a little under 4 percent a year, compared with almost 6 percent in the least developed coun - tries as a whole (figures 8a-8c). International efforts to bring peace to countries in fragile or conflict situations and reforms in other least developed countries are needed to achieve at least 7 percent annual GDP growth (target 8.1). Enhancing economic productivity and value added for labor-intensive sectorsSustained economic growth is achieved through higher productivity, both within sectors and by shifting to sectors that generate higher value added and that yield benefits to workers, employers, and the economy. Variation among sectors is higher in countries with low labor productivity, leading to increased inequality. In many lower income countries a large share of working-age adults is not part of the formal labor force, highlighting the importance of the informal sector and the challenge of raising the productivity and quality of such livelihoods. Gender inequalities persist across regions and sectors: Women make up a smaller share of employment in all regions and are dispropor - tionately employed in lower productivity sec - tors, including agriculture, and in informal sec - tors (figure 8d). Creating jobs \u2014 led by the private sector Creating high-quality, sustainable jobs (target 8.3) requires a strong and thriving private sec - tor. In low- and middle-income countries the private sector accounts for up to 90 percent of jobs. Micro, small, and medium-size enter - prises, especially in services and agriculture, account for the largest share of new jobs. The formal private sector remains underdeveloped and weakly competitive in many low- and mid - dle-income countries, with the number of for - mal wage jobs less than the number of new entrants joining the labor force each year. There is a strong correlation between country income and the density of new formal firms.

Achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all and equal payThe share of people employed in wage jobs varies by region and gender (figure 8f). Almost two-thirds of people who work in Europe and Central Asia have wage jobs, compared with around a fifth in South Asia, where many jobs are in the informal sector. The Middle East and North Africa has the largest gender gap: Nearly 55 percent of men are in wage jobs, compared with 44 percent of women. The share of women in wage jobs is lowest in Sub- Saharan Africa (14 percent), and the share of men in wage jobs is lowest in South Asia (22 percent). Half of low- and middle-income countries in Europe and Central Asia legally mandate that women receive equal pay for work of equal value (target 8.5), compared with a third of low- and middle-income countries in other regions and only one country in South Asia (Bangladesh; figure 8g). Empowering young people to work Sustainable Development Goal 8 focuses on providing opportunities for all, including young people (targets 8.5 and 8.6). Young people not in employment, education, or training represent a missed opportunity and a loss of productive engagement that can have lifelong impacts, including reduced earnings. The Middle East and North Africa and South Asia have the larg - est shares of young people not in employment, education, or training (figure 8h). Young people often face greater challenges in finding employ - ment due to their lack of experience, their lower access to credit, and their more limited net - works that can help identify an employment or entrepreneurial opportunity. Thus youth unem - ployment rates can be double those of adults.

Building sustainable and robust infrastructure Limited access to decent roads can isolate far mers from markets and restrict agricul- tural production to subsistence levels. It also impacts the ability of rural businesses and e n t e r p r i s e s t o c o m p e t e w i t h o t h e r s i n l e s s remote areas. In the short term enhancing rural road connectivity reduces transport costs and improves access to markets and social facili-ties such as schools and hospitals. In the lon-ger term it elevates agricultural productivity, business profitability, and employment. 2 It also helps strengthen the resilience of rural popula-tions to natural and human-made shocks and disasters by facilitating the movement of peo-ple and supplies for faster recovery. The share of the rural population living within 2 kilometers of a road in good condition is measured through the Rural Access Index 3 and is a useful indicator for governments plan-ning their transport infrastructure (target 9.1). Data availability is limited, but advances in digital technology allow better assessment of population distribution and transport infrastruc-ture location and quality. In Mozambique only an estimated 19 percent of the rural population lives within 2 kilometers of a good road, which means that about 14.5 million rural residents lack access (figure 9a). In Kenya an estimated 57 percent of the rural population lives within 2 kilometers of a good road; about 13.5 million rural residents lack access (figure 9b). Driving economic growth through industrialization The industrial sector is vital to economic devel-opment, and manufacturing is key to long-term structural change, formal job creation, and the technology and innovation needed for productiv-ity growth. Manufacturing value added as a share of GDP captures the role of manufacturing in an economy. Worldwide, the share declined from 19 percent in 1997 to 16 percent in 2013 (fig-ure 9c).

Promoting innovation and research and developmentOne measure of innovation is the intensity of research and development, measured as expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP. Worldwide, it increased slightly from 1.6 percent in 2007 to 1.7 percent in 2013, 4 despite the period's global financial crisis. Asia was the first to recover; in particu - lar China's research and development intensity grew from 1.4 percent in 2007 to 2.0 percent in 2013.

It also tackles inequality among countries in terms of voice, migration, and international aid. Reducing inequality within countries Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to pro - gressively achieve, by 2030, sustained income growth among the poorest 40 percent of the population at a rate higher than the national average in every country (target 10.1). This echoes the World Bank's goal of promoting shared prosperity, which does not set a spe - cific target for each country but aims to foster income growth among the poorest 40 percent in every country. In 56 out of 94 countries with data for 2007- 12 the per capita income of the poorest 40 per - cent is growing faster than the national average (countries above the diagonal line in figure 10a). Of those 56, 9 still experienced negative growth (group A in figure 10a), including high-income countries (the United Kingdom and the United States) and middle-income countries (Guate - mala and the Kyrgyz Republic). Thus, higher growth among the poorest 40 percent does not necessarily lead to prosperity. Another group of countries experienced relatively strong growth (above 3 percent) over the same period for both the poorest 40 percent and the total popula - tion, but in some cases the growth rate for the bottom 40 percent was lower than the national average (China and Vietnam; group B in figure 10a). In these cases the Sustainable Develop - ment Goal target would not have been met, even though people on average were better off. Among countries with data, a larger propor - tion of low- and middle-income countries than of high-income countries met the target. Spe - cifically, in around two-thirds of low- and middle- income countries the income of the poorest 40 percent grew faster than the national aver - age, compared with half of high-income coun - tries (figure 10b).

The Sustainable Develop - ment Goals continue this focus, encouraging official development assistance and financial flows to countries where the need is greatest (target 10.b). Over 2009-14, nominal inflows of official development assistance grew 27 percent to $161 billion (figure 10c). But meeting target 10.b may require a change in current trends. Increases in inflows to the poorest countries have not kept pace with those to middle-income countries. Official development assistance to Sub- Saharan Africa increased just 4 percent between 2009 and 2014, and official develop - ment assistance to the least developed coun - tries increased only 9 percent. The trend was driven primarily by a drop in bilateral aid chan - neled directly by donors, which accounts for around 75 percent of total net official develop - ment assistance. For instance, bilateral aid to the least developed countries fell 16 percent between 2013 and 2014, a decline explained only partially by the sharp drop in debt relief to Myanmar. Bilateral official development assis - tance to Sub- Saharan Africa also fell 5 percent in nominal terms from 2013 to 2014. Migration. People migrate for many reasons, including better employment opportunities and higher wages. Many migrants remit money back to their country of origin, to care for their fam - ily, and the amount of such payments is large and has been increasing. Worldwide, personal remittances were estimated at $583 billion in 2014 \u2014 $436 billion (75 percent) of which went to low- and middle-income countries, up 4.3 percent from 2013. But it is not cheap to send money across national borders. The cost of sending the equiv - alent of $200 averaged 8 percent in 2014, down from 10 percent in 2008 but still above the 3 percent called for by 2030 in target 10.c (figure 10d). 050100150200 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005Net of/f_icial development assistance in/f_lows ($ billions) All recipients Least Developed CountriesSub-Saharan AfricaTotal official development assistance has been rising\u2014but not where aid is needed most 10c Source: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development- Development Assistance Committee; World Development Indicators database (DT.ODA.ODAT.CD).0.02.55.07.510.0 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008Average cost to send the equivalent of $200 in remittances (%) Target for 2030The average cost of sending remittances has been declining 10d Source: World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide database (http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org; World Development Indicators database (SI.RMT.COST.ZS).24 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ?An estimated 60 percent of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2030 (figure 11a), and most of the expected 1 billion increase in urban dwellers between 2015 and 2030 will occur in Africa and Asia. This demographic transformation will affect the economic, environmental, social, and political futures of individuals everywhere. Cities are com - plex systems in which every component affects every other. Sustainable Development Goal 11 focuses on making cities and other human settle - ments safe, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. Improving the quality of housing Access to adequate, safe, and affordable hous - ing and basic services, in addition to slum upgrading, is critical to sustainable cities (tar - get 11.1). Although there is no consistent defi - nition of slum areas, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme estimates take into consideration the proportion of urban popula - tion living in dwellings that lack access to an improved drinking water source, improved sani - tation facilities, sufficient living area, durable structure, or security of tenure. In Sub- Saharan Africa more than half the urban population lives in slum conditions. Coun - tries that have faced civil war report the high - est rates: In the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Sudan more than 90 percent of the urban population lives in slums. Moreover, both the Central African Republic and Mozambique have seen the number of slum dwellers rise since 1990 (figure 11b). In those countries poor people move from rural areas to cities in search of greater opportunity but often end up even more entrenched in poverty. Other Sub- Saharan countries have made extraordinary progress in reducing their urban slums. Rwanda lowered the proportion of its urban population living in slums from 96 per - cent in 1990 to 53 percent in 2014. Mali also saw a large decline, from 94 percent of its urban population to 56 percent.

In both regions the levels of out - door PM 2.5 have increased from their 1990 levels. Average pollution levels are estimated by combining satellite observations of airborne particles with models of atmospheric chemis - try, which are calibrated against ground-level air quality monitoring data from nearly 3,400 loca - tions and 79 countries. The satellite-based esti - mates cover both cities and rural areas. While there is no substitute for ground-level moni - toring, particularly in densely populated urban areas, large swathes of the globe still do not have this monitoring infrastructure, so remote sensing technologies such as those used for the Global Burden of Disease study continue to be a powerful tool for measuring large-scale exposure to air pollutants.Measuring the impact of urbanizationMeasuring progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal 11 targets in a consistent way across all countries will be a challenge. For example, the target on transportation systems requires monitoring the proportion of the popu - lation with convenient access to public trans - port. This requires a much more precise under - standing of where people live than is currently available. Other targets call for monitoring land consumption and open space, which requires global data on built-up areas. An even more fundamental challenge is that there is no universal agreement on the defini - tions of \"urban\" and \"city.\" Several Sustainable Development Goal targets use terms such as \"urban population\" and \"cities of over 100,000 people.\" But how large or dense does a settle - ment need to be in order to be considered a city? Do certain kinds of economic activity need to be present for an area to be considered urban? On the outskirts of a city, where precisely does the urban area end and the rural area begin? Each country defines and measures its urban areas differently, making comparison of trends in urbanization across countries problematic. Fortunately, new and innovative forms of data can help monitor progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 11, including maps of built-up areas derived from imagery and radar data from satellites. While each country's national definition may be well suited to its national con - text, global analysis based on these data can be consistent across countries, yielding objec - tive and comparable measures of urbanization. In turn, this can help provide a global picture of the scope and nature of the urbanization chal - lenge and help make cities inclusive, safe, resil - ient, and sustainable. Note 1.

Saving a quarter of this lost food would be enough to feed 870 million people.1 Sustainable consumption and production by countries \u2014 in essence doing more and better with less \u2014 means meeting basic needs of people and promoting a better quality of life while cutting harmful waste and pollution. Managing natural resources efficiently Adjusted net savings is an indicator of effi - cient use of natural resources (target 12.2). It measures the difference between national production and consumption \u2014 the change in a country's wealth. Adjusted net savings takes into account investment in human capi - tal, depreciation of fixed capital, depletion of natural resources, and pollution damage. Posi - tive savings form the basis for building wealth and future growth. Negative savings rates suggest declining wealth and unsustainable development. Adjusted net savings is especially useful for gauging whether countries that depend heavily on natural resources are balancing the depletion of their natural resources by invest - ing rents in other forms of productive capital, such as through education. Low- and lower mid - dle-income countries with the highest level of resource dependence also tend to have lower savings rates (figure 12a). Reducing food loss and waste Meeting the food needs of a growing global pop - ulation while reducing food loss and waste (tar - get 12.3) poses a serious challenge. Food loss is defined as a decrease in quantity or quality of food at any stage of the food supply chain, from the point at which it is harvested or made to the point it is eaten. Food waste occurs when edible food reaches the consumer but expires, is thrown away, or is otherwise neglected and not eaten. The extent of food loss varies greatly by income group and region. In the high-income countries of North America and East Asia and Pacific, the equivalent of more than 1,500 calories of food per person per day is lost, mostly through food waste.

A partial inventory of more than 3,000 toxic sites around the world found that the health of as many as 200 million people living near these sites may be affected. 3 Per capita generation of hazardous waste nearly doubled worldwide between the late 1990s and the late 2000s. In middle-income countries per capita hazardous waste genera - tion rose from 17 kilograms between 1996 and 2000 to 42 kilograms between 2006 and 2011. 4 However, high-income non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries continue to generate the most hazard - ous waste, 981 kilograms per capita between 2006 and 2011 (figure 12b). Hazardous waste generation by low-income countries was 7 kilo - grams per capita over the same period.Reforming fossil fuel subsidiesSustainable Development Goal 12 calls for rationalizing inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies (target 12.3) though there is some debate over how this should be measured. The International Monetary Fund provides a comprehensive esti - mate of subsidies by including not only the difference between the final price consumers pay and international market prices, but also the environmental and social costs of local pollution, road traffic, and climate change (fig - ure 12c). Subsidies as a percentage of GDP are highest in upper middle-income countries (nearly 14 percent), followed by lower middle-income and non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development high-income countries (11 percent).

Climate change is already affecting every country on every continent through changing seasons and weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. Changes in temperature and precipitation pose substantial risks for agriculture, water supplies, food, ecosystems, energy security, and infrastructure. Understanding the impacts of climate change Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for stronger resilience and capacity to adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters; integration of climate change measures into national planning; improved climate-related edu - cation, awareness-raising, and capacity build - ing; and mobilization of sustained resources to address the needs of low- and middle-income countries. Since 1980 both the occurrence and eco - nomic impact of weather-related natural disas - ters such as floods, droughts, and tropical storms have risen. 1 Global climate models indi - cate that by 2050 low- and middle-income coun - tries are more likely than high-income countries to experience higher temperature increases because of geographic location (figure 13a), pos - sibly leading to more extreme weather-related disasters and associated economic losses.Addressing climate changeCountries must take steps to strengthen resil - ience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards (target 13.1) and take early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Hyogo Framework for Action, which pro - vided a global blueprint for a range of disaster risk reduction efforts for 2005-15, cites climate change as one of the primary factors increasing the severity of future disasters. Under the frame - work, countries used a 1-5 scale to assess progress on 22 indicators in five areas. Under area 4, which addressed underlying risk factors (including weather, environment, and climate change), the share of countries reporting a score of 4 or higher rose from 13 percent in 2009-11 to 27 percent in 2013-15 (figure 13b). Integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning is critical (target 13.2). 2 The December 2015 Paris Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts* * Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.SDG 13 Climate action Estimated minimum and maximum temperature increases by 2050 from average for 1961-2000 (degrees Celsius) High incomeMiddle incomeLow incomeMaximum Minimum 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5Temperatures are projected to rise significantly by 2050 13a Note: Data are the median estimate of general circulation models.

Global emissions of carbon dioxide \u2014 a major greenhouse gas and primary driver of climate change \u2014 increased from 22.2 billion metric tons in 1990 to 34.6 billion in 2011 and contributed to an increase of about 0.8 degree Celsius in mean global temperature above pre-industrial times (figure 13c). As of December 2015, 160 nationally deter - mined contributions from 188 countries have been submitted to the United Nations Frame - work Convention on Climate Change. These commitments include measures to reduce emissions (mitigation), better manage the impacts of change climate on socioeconomic systems and ecosystems (adaptation), and sup - port national policies and planning. 3 The Paris Agreement calls for these contributions to be reviewed and strengthened every five years. Financing the response to climate change Sustainable Development Goal 13 also looks at climate finance, in particular the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change goal of committing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of low- and middle-income countries and mobilizing the Green Climate Fund (target 13.a). Organisation for Economic Co-oper - ation and Development data show climate financ - ing from public and private sources, as well as export credits, from high-income to low- and mid - dle-income countries (adjusting for multilateral sources) to be approximately $61.8 billion in 2014, up from $52.2 billion in 2013 (figure 13d). Development is moving toward climate-resilient and low emission pathways in many low- and middle-income countries, 4 which is likely to be enhanced by multilateral development bank com - mitments to increase support for climate change and disaster risk management, especially in low-income countries. For example, the World Bank includes climate change risks and opportunities in the country partnership frameworks that spec - ify major development challenges in countries and areas of support from partners.

Average worldwide fish consumption is about 20 kilograms per person per year. Yields from the planet's oceans, seas, and marine resources are essen - tial to the food security of much of the world's population. Monitoring progress toward the sustainability of these resources is paramount but creates substantial challenges. Sustainably capturing and farming seafood Capture fisheries have dominated the seafood market until recently. Since the 1980s there has been a rise in aquaculture (fish, shellfish, and seaweed farming), which now accounts for nearly half of seafood production (figure 14a). East Asia and Pacific dominates capture fisheries and aquaculture production, where it accounts for over 90 percent of output. Capture fisheries have generally stagnated since the early 1990s, and many govern - ments have implemented subsidy schemes to protect local fish supplies and employment in the sector. Subsidies to fisheries total approxi - mately $10 billion a year, driving continued fishing despite decreasing catch value and profitability. 1 Ensuring the effective regulation of fish harvesting along with stopping overfish - ing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices (target 14.4) can support the sustainability of the fishing industry, aquatic habitats, and biodiversity. Based on data for 54 countries and the high seas, illegal and unreported fishers catch 11-26 million tons a year, reducing revenues to legal fishers $10-$23.5 billion a year. 2 Low- and middle- income countries with weak regulatory and enforcement capacity are most at risk from ille-gal fishing.

Protecting and conserving the oceans Marine protected areas can help rebuild deplet-ing s tocks and act as sanctuaries for biodiver- sity. As of 2014, approximately 2 percent of the global oceans are designated as marine protected areas, with various levels of actual control of access. 5 Target 14.5 seeks the con- servation, by 2020, of at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas. According to the country-level data available, by 2014 South Asia had the lowest share of marine protected areas in its territorial waters. But all regions have achieved at least some progress over the previous two decades (figure 14b). The condition of marine biodiversity and of the global environment is closely connected with the level of ocean pollution and acidifica-tion. The number of dead zones \u2014 areas of ocean with too little oxygen for most marine life \u2014 has increased by a third between 1995 and 2007, largely as the result of nutrient pol-lution. Dead zones now rank alongside overfish-ing, habitat loss, and harmful algal blooms as key stressors of marine ecosystems. There are some 405 dead zones in coastal waters world-wide (figure 14c), affecting an area of 95,000 square miles. 6 Notes 1.

Between 1990 and 2015 the world lost more than 129 million hectares \u2014 over 3 per - cent of its forest area. The impact of human activity on the environment directly affects the world's poorest communities, and deforestation, de - sertification, and loss of biodiversity all pose major challenges to future sustainable development. Protecting forests Crucial to the health of the planet, to its diverse species, and to the livelihoods of a fifth of the human population, 1 forests contribute to long-term economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental stability. Despite numer - ous international engagements to protect for - est areas, national and regional afforestation and reforestation efforts need to accelerate in order to ensure the sustainability of forests (target 15.2). While some regions have steadily increased forest coverage, Latin America and the Caribbean has lost 97 million hectares since 1990, and Sub- Saharan Africa has lost 83 million hectares (figure 15a). Over 16 per - cent of Brazil's original Amazonian forest has disappeared, and the current rate of loss is 2 million hectares a year. Pressures on forests will continue as the world's population grows, urbanization accelerates, and demand for food, fiber, energy, and minerals increases. Minimizing desertification and land degradation The loss of potential and existing agricultural land to drought, floods, and land degradation affects vast swathes of the world's poor, many of whom depend on agriculture for their liveli - hoods and nourishment. Restoring land and soil (target 15.3) helps keep land degradation in check. Soil degradation affects 52 percent of agri - cultural land, and arable land is being lost at 30-35 times its historical rate. Drought and desertification have led to losses of 12 mil - lion hectares, 2 on which 20 million tons of grain could have been grown, and have further impoverished already vulnerable communities.

Implementing sustainable and integrated land and water management prac - tices will help the areas and populations most impacted. Safeguarding natural habitats and biodiversity As forests, drylands, and freshwater ecosys - tems disappear, so does the world's biodiver - sity. Action to protect and prevent the extinc - tion of threatened species and their habitats will help reverse this (target 15.5). Plants pro - vide humanity with 80 percent of the human diet, and populations throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America use traditional plant- based medicine to help meet their healthcare needs. Substantial gains have been made in conserv - ing biodiversity (figure 15c), with roughly 12 per - cent of global forests now designated as pro - tected areas. Many species are under threat of extinction due to climate change, poaching, overfishing, pollution, and habitat degradation. Of the 8,300 animal breeds known to humans, 8 percent are extinct, and 22 percent are on the brink of extinction. Among assessed species, the high - est number of threatened plants are in Latin America and Caribbean, the highest number of threatened fish are in Sub- Saharan Africa, and the highest number of threatened mammals and birds are in East Asia and Pacific (figure 15d).

However, many states are in fragile situations, with citizens and their daily lives compromised by fear, conflict, unjust laws, and opaque governance. The success of the Sustainable Development Goals in such areas depends on achieving livable and calm communities supported by reliable and accountable institutions. Reducing violence and related deaths Protecting the lives of people is one of the most important obligations of states (target 16.1). Intentional homicide occurs in every country, but homicide rates vary across and within regions. Latin America and the Carib - bean had the highest homicide rate in 2012, 23 per 100,000 people \u2014 almost four times the global average of 6 per 100,000 people (figure 16a). Sub- Saharan Africa had 14 homicides per 100,000 people. East Asia and Pacific had the lowest: 2 homicides per 100,000 people. One measure of peace is the absence of conflict-related deaths. Escalation of several conflicts, coupled with the extreme violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, resulted in 2014 having the highest number of battled-related deaths since 1989. More than 54,000 people were killed in Syria in battle-related deaths in 2014, the most of any country (figure 16b). In the same year, about 12,250 people were killed in Afghanistan, and close to 12,000 were killed in Iraq. Promoting justice Strong justice and rule of law systems pro - vide mechanisms for resolving land and natu - ral resource disputes, keeping governments accountable to citizens, and giving businesses the confidence to enter into and enforce con - tracts (target 16.3). One monitoring tool is the proportion of the population that has experienced a dispute; accessed a formal, informal, alternative, or traditional dispute resolution mechanism; and feels the process was just.

Strengthening institutions Building stronger institutions requires efficient, effective, and accountable public spending. Comparing actual primary government expendi - ture with the original approved budget is one way of analyzing how well government budgets are planned and public financial management is executed. The Public Expenditure and Finan - cial Accountability Program assesses how close 144 national governments come to meeting their proposed targets. Over the past 10 years nearly two-thirds of participating countries were within 10 percentage points of their original budgets, and around half of those were within 5 percentage points (figure 16c). However, more than a tenth of countries deviated by more than 15 percentage points. Providing legal identity for all Effective civil registration and vital statistics systems capture key life events, such as births, marriages, and deaths. In seeking legal iden - tity for all, including full birth registration by 2030 (target 16.9), such systems can provide a crucial tool in a wide range of public policies and programs in health, education, water and sanitation, social protection, food security, and labor and employment. Globally, many births go unregistered. In 2011 only 72 percent of children under age 5 had their births registered, and in Sub- Saharan Africa fewer than half were registered (figure 16d). In contrast, birth registration is nearly uni - versal in Europe and Central Asia. Securing the right to information A citizen's \"right to know\" reflects a country's commitment to widespread, fair, and transparent sustainable development (target 16.10). Estab - lishing legislative guarantees and mechanisms for public access to information safeguards fundamental freedoms and facilitates public input and review. However, implementation and enforcement of such guarantees and mecha - nisms are difficult to measure. Measuring both the quality of laws and legislative guarantees and their levels of implementation will be neces - sary to measure progress toward target 16.10. 1 Note 1. Trapnell, S. E., and V. L.

Increasing aid flows Official development assistance from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) have increased 66 percent in real terms since 2000, to $137 billion in 2014. Net official development assistance as a share of DAC countries' combined gross national income (GNI) was 0.29 percent, on a par with 2013 (fig - ure 17a). Five DAC members exceeded the UN official development assistance target of 0.7 per - cent of GNI. The United States was the largest donor by volume: $32 billion in 2014, or 0.19 per - cent of GNI. Humanitarian aid rose 22 percent in real terms in 2014 and accounted for 10 percent of net official development assistance flows. Enabling development through remittances International migration has an important role in economic relations between low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. An estimated 232 million people, 3.2 percent of the world's population, live and work outside their home country. 1 International remittances, in the form of personal transfers and compen - sation of employees, have a profound impact on economic outcomes. In 2014 international remittances totaled $528 billion, 72 percent ($378 billion) of which went to low- and middle-income countries (figure 17b). This was equiv - alent to 1.7 percent of these countries' com - bined GNI and close to two and a half times the level of official development assistance from DAC donors. For India, the world's largest recipi - ent, international remittances totaled $70 bil - lion in 2014, or 3.4 percent of GNI, only margin - ally less than the net inflows of debt and foreign direct investment combined. Supporting the most vulnerable countries The world's 48 least developed countries, home to 1 billion people, account for only 3 percent of low- and middle-income countries' export earn - ings.

Between 2009 and 2013 strong global commodity prices drove the least devel - oped countries' export earnings up 63 percent, on a par with the 65 percent increase in those of other low- and middle-income countries. But the least developed countries' lack of diversified export base leaves them vulnerable to global economic trends. In 2014 least developed coun - tries' export earnings fell 13 percent, compared with a 2.6 percent increase in other low- and middle-income countries. Using public-private partnerships to finance infrastructurePublic-private partnerships have a crucial role in improving efficiency in the delivery of public services and helping governments address infra - structure gaps. From 1990 to 2014 low- and middle-income countries received commitments of $1.44 trillion to finance more than 6,800 infra - structure public-private partnership projects. The pattern of commitments has been uneven, with strong growth prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis followed by sharp declines before struc - tural reforms, favorable macroeconomic poli - cies, and buoyant global economic conditions sparked a recovery (figure 17d). Commitments increased sevenfold from 2005 to 2012, to a record $158 billion. Over this period commit - ments rose 414 percent for energy, 166 percent for transport, and 96 percent for water. Commit - ments have been flat since 2012, reflecting a slowdown in key emerging markets. In relation to GDP, investment commitments for public-pri - vate partnerships in infrastructure remain low, at 0.2-0.6 percent, only half the level recorded prior to the Asian financial crisis.

The need for improvements are explicit in targets 17.18 and 17.19 and are a foundation for Agenda 2030: Reliable data are needed to measure progress and support implementation of every one of the Sustainable Development Goals. For most indicators the best ways to improve data availability are to invest in national statis - tical capacity and to develop stronger partner - ships among international agencies, govern - ments, and civil society. These investments work: Data availability has steadily improved over the last two decades. For instance, the number of countries with enough estimates of poverty incidence to measure a meaningful trend increased from just 2 in 1991 to 53 in 2012 (figure SC1). Agenda 2030 pledges that no one will be left behind and that the goals and targets will be met by all countries, people, and segments of society. This pledge places new demands on data and statistics and means that disaggrega - tion by sex, income group, age, location, and other dimensions of development takes on new importance. Major investment in appropriate instruments, such as household surveys and civil and vital registration systems, will be required. The World Bank's Statistical Capacity Indica - tor is one tool for comparing statistical capac - ity across countries and over time. Calculated since 2004 using publicly available informa - tion, it measures low- and middle-income countries' ability to collect and disseminate statistics about their populations, economies, and societies. The composite indicator com - bines a variety of different measures to illus - trate general trends, but the components can help identify specific areas where progress is being made and where improvements are still needed. For example, Ghana has seen a steady increase in its overall average score, from 51 to 66, because of better statistical methodolo - gies. Notable improvements were a new base year and weights for the consumer price index, rebased national accounts, and better esti - mates of vaccination coverage. The average of the Statistical Capacity Indi - cator has increased in all regions over the last decade (figure SC2), but Sub- Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa have the lowest average. Of the 10 countries with the highest overall indicator value for 2015, 3 were in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 7 were in Europe and Central Asia.

It promotes better use of resources and better access to essential services and enables a higher qual - ity of life. Financial inclusion is an important enabler of development. Improving access to financial services is a cross-cutting target of the Sustainable Development Goals and is explicitly recognized in Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Financial inclusion means having access to a full range of affordable formal financial prod - ucts and services, delivered responsibly by sus - tainable institutions. To manage their financial lives, adults need access to an account or an electronic instrument to securely store money, send payments, and receive deposits. But around 2 billion adults worldwide do not have such an account, and many small businesses cannot access the financial instruments they need. Financial inclusion is a complex con - cept and is difficult to measure. Important aspects are access to, use of, and quality of services. Moreover, relevant data have been scarce, though recent efforts are improving the situation. One measure of access to financial ser - vices is account ownership. Between 2011 and 2014, 700 million adults became new accountholders, and the share of adults with an account at a financial institution increased from 51 percent to 61 percent. Another 1 per - cent, while not having an account at a finan - cial institution, reported using mobile money services. In a select group of 10 low- and middle- income countries with data for 2014, a large share of small and medium-size enterprises have an account at a financial institution, but only a small share obtains financing through loans (figure FI1). The physical infrastructure of the financial system has been improving. While the number of bank branches per adult remained more or less unchanged worldwide between 2010 and 2014, the number of automated teller machines rose quickly (figure FI2). And innovative ways of accessing financial services are making brick-and-mortar branches less relevant in many cases.

Episodes of unrest can reverse development efforts and rapidly dismantle achievements built over a long time, along social, political economy, and physical dimensions. Overall, around a fifth of the world's popula - tion is estimated to be in a fragile, conflict, or violent situation, spanning the 35 countries on the World Bank's Harmonized List of Fragile Sit - uations as well as pockets of violence in other countries. The number of forcibly displaced persons \u2014 which includes internally displaced people, refugees, and asylum seekers \u2014 is esti - mated to be 60 million, the highest since World War II. In 2014 the Middle East and North Africa was the region of origin for 4.5 million refu - gees, 87 percent of whom came from the Syr - ian Arab Republic, and Sub- Saharan Africa was the region of origin for 4.4 million (figure FCV1). The two regions also lead the world in granting asylum to refugees. The influx of refugees to host countries presents challenges. Sustainable Develop - ment Goals 4 (quality education), 8 (productive employment and economic growth), and 10 (reduce inequalities) will be directly impacted as low- and middle-income countries absorb refugees. Sustainability means that refugees will need to find decent work, their children will need to be educated, and the conflicts and poverty in their home countries will need to be resolved. Impacting lives and livelihoods In fragile, conflict, and violent situations individ - uals and their day-to-day lives are threatened, and their surroundings become dangerous. People flee, and the numbers of internally dis - placed persons and refugees increase. Fragil - ity, conflict, and violence damage the social fab - rics and social contract of countries, impacting behavioral codes and trust in government and aggravating ethnic or religious friction. Fragil - ity, conflict, and violence often disproportion - ately affect the health and safety of women and children. 1 Combined with the erosion of wom - en's education and rights (including access to reproductive health services), fragility, conflict, and violence often lead to a paradoxical surge in birth rates, increasing pressure on already strained education and health systems. Eroding institutions and political economy Governance, rule of law, trust between citizens and governments, justice, and human rights fail when countries become fragile or are affected by conflict or violence. These failures affect the economy by discouraging investments and causing capital flight. In fragile, conflict, and violent situations shadow economies tend to flourish, and the rogue exploitation of mineral and natural resources often finances and fuels conflicts. Note 1.

parity (PPP) terms. It is also referred to as the extreme poverty rate. The PPP 2011 $1.90 a day poverty line is the average poverty line of the 15 poorest countries in the world, estimated from household surveys conducted by national statis-tical offices or by private agencies under the supervi-sion of government or international agencies. Income and consumption data used for estimating poverty are also collected from household surveys. The 2012 estimates are the latest comprehensive update and draw on more than 2 million randomly sampled house-holds, representing 87 percent of the population in 131 low- and middle-income countries (as defined in 1990). This map shows the country-level poverty esti-mates used to generate the 2012 regional and global poverty estimates. Because 2011 PPPs for Bangla-desh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Jordan require further investigation, estimates for those countries are based on the 2005 PPP $1.25 a day poverty line.

They also pro - vide a broad indication of actual and potential resources and are therefore used throughout World Development Indicators to normal - ize other indicators. Population Population estimates are usually based on national population cen - suses. Estimates for the years before and after the census are interpolations or extrapolations based on demographic models. Errors and undercounting occur even in high-income countries; in some low- and middle- income countries errors may be substan - tial because of limits in the transport, communications, and other resources required to conduct and analyze a full census. The quality and reliability of official demographic data are also affected by public trust in the government, government commit - ment to full and accurate enumeration, confidentiality and protection against misuse of census data, and census agencies' independence from political influence. Moreover, comparability of population indi - cators is limited by differences in the concepts, definitions, collec - tion procedures, and estimation methods used by national statisti - cal agencies and other organizations that collect the data. More countries conducted a census in the 2010 census round (2005-14) than in previous rounds. As of December 2014 (the end of the 2010 census round), about 93 percent of the estimated world population has been enumerated in a census. The currentness of a census and the availability of complementary data from surveys or registration systems are important indicators of demographic data quality. See Sources and methods for the most recent census or survey year and for the completeness of registration. Current population estimates for low- and middle- income coun - tries that lack recent census data and pre- and post-census esti - mates for countries with census data are provided by the United Nations Population Division and other agencies. The cohort com - ponent method\u2014a standard method for estimating and projecting population\u2014requires fertility, mortality, and net migration data, often collected from sample surveys, which can be small or limited in coverage. Population estimates are derived from demographic modeling and so are susceptible to biases and errors from short - comings in the model and in the data. In the UN estimates, because the five-year age group is the cohort unit and five-year period data are used, interpolations to obtain annual data or single age struc - ture may not reflect actual events or age composition. Surface area Surface area includes inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways and thus differs from land area, which excludes bodies of water, and from gross area, which may include offshore territo - rial waters. It is particularly important for understanding an econo - my's agricultural capacity and the environmental effects of human activity. Innovations in satellite mapping and computer databases have resulted in more precise measurements of land and water areas. Urban population There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distin - guishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries. Most countries use an urban clas - sification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because the estimates in the table are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or met - ropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. Size of the economy GNI measures total domestic and foreign value added claimed by residents. GNI comprises GDP plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from nonresi - dent sources. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output. GNI is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Value added is the net output of an industry after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. The World Bank uses GNI per capita in U.S. dollars to clas - sify countries for analytical purposes and to determine borrowing eligibility. For definitions of the income groups in World Development Indicators, see User guide. When calculating GNI in U.S. dollars from GNI reported in national currencies, the World Bank follows the World Bank Atlas conversion method, using a three-year average of exchange rates to smooth the effects of transitory fluctuations in exchange rates. (For further dis - cussion of the World Bank Atlas method, see Sources and methods .) Because exchange rates do not always reflect differences in price levels between countries, the table also converts GNI and GNI per capita estimates into international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) rates. PPP rates provide a standard measure allowing comparison of real levels of expenditure between countries, just as conventional price indexes allow comparison of real values over time. PPP rates are calculated by simultaneously comparing the prices of similar goods and services among a large number of countries. In the most recent round of price surveys by the International Com - parison Program (ICP) in 2011, 177 countries and territories fully participated and 22 partially participated. PPP rates for 47 high- and upper middle-income countries are from Eurostat and the Organ - isation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); PPP estimates incorporate new price data collected since 2011. For the remaining 2011 ICP economies PPP rates are extrapolated from the 2011 ICP benchmark results, which account for relative price About the data54 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ?1 World view changes between each economy and the United States. For coun - tries that did not participate in the 2011 ICP round, PPP rates are imputed using a statistical model. More information on the results of the 2011 ICP is available at http://icp.worldbank.org. Growth rates of GDP and GDP per capita are calculated using constant price data in local currency. Constant price U.S. dollar series are used to calculate regional and income group growth rates. Growth rates in the table are annual averages (see Sources and methods ). Definitions Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship\u2014except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. The values shown are midyear estimates. Surface area is a country's total area, including areas under inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways. Population density is midyear population divided by land area. Urban population is the midyear popula - tion of areas defined as urban in each country and obtained by the United Nations Population Division. Gross national income, Atlas method, is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. Data are in current U.S. dol - lars converted using the World Bank Atlas method (see Sources and methods ). Gross national income, purchasing power parity, is GNI converted to international dollars using PPP rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GNI that a U.S. dollar has in the United States. Gross national income per capita is GNI divided by midyear population. Gross domestic product is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output. Growth is calculated from constant price GDP data in local currency. Gross domestic product per capita is GDP divided by midyear population.Data sources The World Bank's population estimates are compiled and produced by its Development Data Group in consultation with its Health Global Practice, operational staff, and country offices. The United Nations Population Division (2015) is a source of the demographic data for more than half the countries, most of them low- and middle- income countries. Other important sources are census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, Euro - stat's Population database, the United Nations Statistics Division's Population and Vital Statistics Report, and the U.S. Bureau of the Census's International Data Base. Data on surface and land area are from the Food and Agriculture Organization, which gathers these data from national agencies through annual questionnaires and by analyzing the results of national agricultural censuses. Data on urban population shares are from United Nations Population Division (2014). GNI, GNI per capita, GDP growth, and GDP per capita growth are estimated by World Bank staff based on national accounts data collected by World Bank staff during economic mis - sions or reported by national statistical offices to other interna - tional organizations such as the OECD. PPP conversion factors are estimates by Eurostat/OECD and by World Bank staff based on data collected by the ICP. References Eurostat. n.d. Population database. [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/].

Source: World Bank PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/).60 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ?The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using house - hold survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank's Development Research Group maintains a database that updates regional and global aggregates annually. The database incorporates country-level updates as soon as new survey data become available. The latest comprehensive revision took place in October 2015 and incorporate many revisions. The two most notable ones were the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors and the new international poverty line at $1.90 a day. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the global poverty line has to be periodically updated to reflect changes in prices. The previous change was in 2008, when 2005 PPP $1.25 a day was adopted as the global line. The latest revision is based on the national poverty lines of the same 15 poorest countries from the 2008 revision and thus preserves the real purchasing power of the previous line in the world's poorest countries (World Bank 2016). Based on the new poverty line of 2011 PPP $1.90 a day, the World Bank revised the entire series of global poverty, from 1981 to 2012, using the latest household income and consumption sur - vey data. For five countries (Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Lao PDR), the poverty estimates are still measured at 2005 PPP $1.25 a day because price data (both consumer price indexes and 2011 PPPs) need to be further analyzed before being used to estimate poverty. PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet) is an inter - active computational tool that allows users to replicate these inter - nationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day poverty estimates for countries, regions, and custom country groupings and for different poverty lines. The Poverty and Equity Data portal (http://poverty data.worldbank.org/poverty/home) provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national poverty lines (see online table 2.7) alongside the internationally comparable estimates in the table produced from PovcalNet. Data availability The World Bank's internationally comparable poverty monitoring database draws on income or detailed consumption data from more than 1,000 household surveys across 131 low- and middle-income countries and 21 high-income countries (as defined in 1990). For high-income countries, estimates are available for inequality and income distribution only. The 2012 estimates use more than 2 mil - lion randomly sampled households, representing 87 percent of the population in low- and middle-income countries. Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, accessibility, quality, and comparability of household surveys need to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remain low in small states, countries in fragile situations, low-income countries, and even some middle-income countries. The lack of frequent, timely, and comparable data available in some countries creates uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. The table on trends in poverty indicators reports the percentage of the regional and global population represented by household survey samples collected during the reference year or during the two preceding or two subsequent years (in other words, within a five-year window centered on the reference year). Data cov - erage in Sub- Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa remains low and variable. The need to improve household survey programs for monitoring poverty is clearly urgent. But institutional, political, and financial obstacles continue to limit data collection, analysis, and public access. Data quality Other data quality issues arise in measuring household living stan - dards. Surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained per - sonnel. Income is difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. Moreover, income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption for about two-thirds of countries. Similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of dif - ferences in timing, sampling frames, or the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of devel - opment also pose problems because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in poor rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure, but in practice are often not. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary. The statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income data. Analysis of some 20 coun - tries for which both consumption and income data were available from the same surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality. When poverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled each other out: there was no significant statisti - cal difference. Invariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home during the interview visit. This is referred to as \"unit nonresponse\" and is distinct from \"item nonresponse,\" which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to income or consumption. To Poverty rates About the dataWorld Development Indicators 2016 61 Economy States and markets Global links Back the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes may not be equally likely to respond. Richer households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of privacy concerns. It is conceiv - able that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless or nomadic and hard to reach in standard household sur - vey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less likely to be interviewed. This can bias both poverty and inequality measurement if not corrected for (Korinek, Mistiaen, and Ravallion 2007). International poverty lines International comparisons of poverty estimates entail both concep - tual and practical problems. Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons across countries can be dif - ficult. National poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries. Poverty measures based on an international poverty line attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Since World Development Report 1990 the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of cur - rencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equiva - lent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank. International poverty lines were revised following the release of PPPs compiled in the 2005 round and the 2011 round of the Interna - tional Comparison Program, along with data from an expanded set of household income and expenditure surveys. The current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which repre - sents the mean of the poverty lines found in the poorest 15 coun - tries ranked by per capita consumption. This poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty\u2014the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world\u2014but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in low- and middle-income countries (World Bank 2015). PPP exchange rates are used to estimate global poverty because they take into account the local prices of goods and services not traded internationally. But PPP rates were designed for comparing aggregates from national accounts, not for making international poverty comparisons. As a result, there is no certainty that an international poverty line measures the same degree of need or deprivation across countries. So-called poverty PPPs, designed to compare the consumption of the poorest people in the world, might provide a better basis for comparison of poverty across countries. Work on these measures is ongoing. Definitions International poverty line in local currency is the international poverty lines of $1.90 and $3.10 a day in 2011 prices, converted to local currency using the PPP conversion factors estimated by the International Comparison Program. Reference year is the period of reference of a survey. For surveys in which the period of refer - ence covers multiple years, it is the first year. Population below $1.90 a day and population below $3.10 a day are the percent - ages of the population living on less than $1.90 a day and $3.10 a day at 2011 international prices. As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, consumer price indexes, or welfare aggregates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with pov - erty rates reported in earlier editions. The PovcalNet online data - base and tool (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet) always contain the most recent full time series of comparable country data. Poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty line (counting the nonpoor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence. Data sources The poverty measures are prepared by the World Bank's Develop - ment Research Group. The international poverty lines are based on nationally representative primary household surveys conducted by national statistical offices or by private agencies under the supervi - sion of government or international agencies and obtained from government statistical offices and World Bank Group country depart - ments.

The database was updated and expanded in October 2015 to include estimates for 94 countries, including high- income countries. The period of growth assessed was updated from around 2006-11 to around 2007-12 (World Bank 2015b). Promoting shared prosperity is defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in every coun - try and is measured by calculating the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent. The choice of the bottom 40 percent as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40 percent differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally. And at the country level the shared prosperity goal is unbounded (World Bank 2015a). Improvements in shared prosperity require both a growing econ - omy and a consideration of equity. Shared prosperity explicitly recog - nizes that while growth is necessary for improving economic welfare in a society, progress is measured by how those gains are shared with its poorest members. Moreover, in an inclusive society, it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an absolute minimum standard of living; economic growth must increase prosperity among poor people over time. The decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken to ignore the many other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measure\u2014though measurement challenges exist. Indeed, shared prosperity comprises many dimen - sions of well-being of the less well-off, and when analyzing shared prosperity in the context of a country, it is important to consider a wide range of indicators of welfare. To generate measures of shared prosperity that are reasonably comparable across countries, the World Bank Group has a standard - ized approach for choosing time periods, data sources, and other relevant parameters. The Global Database of Shared Prosperity is the result of these efforts. Its purpose is to allow for cross-country comparison and benchmarking, but users should consider alter - native choices for surveys and time periods when cross-country comparison is not the primary consideration. World Development Indicators includes the following shared pros - perity indicators: survey mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent, survey mean per capita real income or con - sumption of the total population, annualized growth of survey mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent, and annualized growth of survey mean per capita real income or con - sumption of the total population. Related information, such as survey years defining the growth period and the type of welfare aggregate used to calculate the growth rates, are provided in the footnotes.In the latest update of the database, survey means of income or consumption are updated with the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) rates for all countries except Bangladesh, Cambodia, Iraq, and Lao PDR, for which survey means are presented in 2005 PPP terms because price data, both consumer price indexes and 2011 PPPs, require further investigation. The World Bank Group is committed to updating the shared pros - perity indicators every year. Given that new household surveys are not available for every year for most countries, updated estimates will be reported for only a subset of countries each year. Calculation of growth rates Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not con - duct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2015 update: the final year of the growth period (T 1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2010, and the initial year ( T 0) is as close to T1 - 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 - 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year. Once two surveys are selected for a country, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in years T 0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula. Growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the total population is computed in the same way using data for the total population. Data availability This edition of World Development Indicators includes estimates of shared prosperity for 71 low- and middle-income countries and 23 high-income countries. While all countries are encouraged to estimate the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent, the Global Database of Shared Prosperity includes only a subset of countries that meet certain criteria. The first important consideration is comparability across time and across countries. Household surveys are infrequent in most countries and are rarely aligned across countries in terms of timing. Consequently, comparisons across countries or over time should be made with a high degree of caution. Lack of household survey data is even more problematic for mon - itoring shared prosperity than for monitoring poverty. To monitor shared prosperity, two surveys of a country have to be conducted Shared prosperity About the dataWorld Development Indicators 2016 65 Economy States and markets Global links Back within five years or so during a chosen period\u2014in this case around 2007-12. They have to be reasonably comparable in both survey design and construction of the welfare aggregates. Thus, not every survey that can generate poverty estimates can generate shared prosperity estimates. The second consideration is the coverage of countries, with data that are as recent as possible. Since shared prosperity must be estimated and used at the country level, there are good reasons for obtaining a wide coverage of countries, regardless of the size of their population. Moreover, for policy purposes it is important to have indicators for the most recent period possible for each coun - try. The selection of survey years and countries needs to be made consistently and transparently, achieving a balance among matching the time period as closely as possible across all countries, including the most recent data, and ensuring the widest possible coverage of countries, across regions and income levels. In practice, this means that time periods will not match perfectly across countries. This is a compromise: While it introduces a degree of incomparability, it also creates a database that includes a larger set of countries than would be possible otherwise. Data quality Like poverty rates, estimates of annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent are based on income or consumption data collected in household sur - veys, and the same quality issues apply. See the discussion in the Poverty rates section. Definitions Period is the period of reference of a survey. For surveys in which the period of reference covers multiple years, it is the first year. Annualized growth in mean income or consumption per capita is the annualized growth in mean per capita real income consump - tion from household surveys over a roughly five-year period. It is calculated for the bottom 40 percent of a country's population and for the total population of a country. Mean income or consump - tion per capita is the mean income or consumption per capita from household surveys used in calculating the welfare growth rate, expressed in PPP-adjusted dollars per day at 2011 prices. It is cal - culated for the bottom 40 percent of a country's population and for the total population of a country. Data sources The Global Database of Shared Prosperity was prepared by the Global Poverty Working Group, which comprises poverty measure - ment specialists of different departments of the World Bank Group. The database's primary source of data is the World Bank Group's PovcalNet database, an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate the World Bank Group's official poverty estimates measured at international poverty lines ($1.90 or $3.10 per day per capita). The datasets included in PovcalNet are provided and reviewed by the members of the Global Poverty Working Group. The choice of consumption or income to measure shared prosperity for a country is consistent with the welfare aggregate used to estimate extreme poverty rates in PovcalNet, unless there are strong argu - ments for using a different welfare aggregate. The practice adopted by the World Bank Group for estimating global and regional poverty rates is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as the welfare measure wherever available and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which consumption data are unavailable. However, in some cases data on consumption may be available but are outdated or not shared with the World Bank Group for recent survey years. In these cases, if data on income are avail - able, income is used for estimating shared prosperity. References World Bank. 2015a.

Together with the indicators in World view, such as population, poverty, and shared prosperity, they provide a multidimensional portrait of the progress of societ - ies across the world. As with the Millennium Devel - opment Goals, people is one of the key themes of the new Sustainable Development Goals. Data for estimating the indicators in the Peo- ple section have been collected and compiled by national authorities and various international development agencies, including the World Bank. In many cases, thematic interagency and expert collaboration helps ensure that estimates are robust, reliable, and timely. For example, estimates of child mortality used to vary by data source and by methodol - ogy, making interpretation for global monitoring difficult. The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, established in 2004, has addressed this issue by compiling all available data, assessing data quality, and fitting an appropriate statistical model to generate a smooth trend curve. This effort has improved accuracy, transparency, and comparability of estimates of neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates that span more than 50 years. Similar interagency efforts have also improved maternal mortality estimates. For gender statis - tics the World Bank is helping develop method - ologies to collect data on asset ownership and entrepreneurship. The World Bank also leads data collection efforts in such areas as finan - cial inclusion and employment law and business regulations from a gender perspective. Alongside interagency collaboration, a close working relationship with countries and national statistical offices and investment in improving national statistical capacity help advance data quality at both the national and subnational levels. The Sustainable Development Goals call for dis - aggregated indicators, and some estimates pre - sented in People are now available by subnational location, including those for malnutrition, poverty, and population (see http://data.worldbank.org /wdi/sub-national). These data highlight dispari - ties within countries, and World Development Indicators will continue to expand its subnational coverage, wherever data sources permit. An important update this year is an adjust - ment to the international poverty line to reflect the new update to purchasing power parity rates from the 2011 round of the International Com - parison Program. The international poverty line has been set at $1.90 a day per person in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, replacing the previous line of $1.25 a day per person in 2005 PPP terms. The entire series of global poverty rates \u2014 from 1981 to 2012 \u2014 has been revised based on these new data. For more information, see the About the data for poverty rates in World view. Other indicators have also been added this year, many of them related to the Sustainable Development Goals, including prevalence of anemia among all women of repro - ductive age, contraceptive prevalence (modern methods), share of deaths that are registered, demand for family planning satisfied by modern methods, share of the population practicing open defecation, prevalence of road traffic injuries, risk of catastrophic expenditure for surgical care, risk of impoverishing expenditure for surgical care, size of the specialist surgical workforce, number of surgical procedures performed, indicators of financial inclusion, prevalence of violence against women, prevalence of child marriage, prevalence of female genital mutilation or cutting, women's agency, and a wider range of education indicators.2Dominican Republic Trinidad andTobagoGrenadaSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesDominicaPuertoRico, U.S. St. Kitts and NevisAntigua andBarbuda St. Lucia Barbados R.B. de VenezuelaU.S. Brazil Bolivia Chile Argentina UruguayAmericanSamoa (U.S.)French Polynesia (Fr.)Bermuda(U.K.) French IBRD 4221595 or more 85-9470-8450-69Less than 50 No dataEducation for all Primary completion rate, most recent year available during 2010-15 (% of relevant age group) 68 World Development Indicators 2016The primary completion rate is the proportion of new entrants in the last grade of primary education among th e total population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education. The rate can exceed 100 percent because new entrants may include over-age and underage children. It reflects both the cov-erage of the education system and the educational attainment of students. Although the rate does not always ensure that expected learning outcomes occur, since some students finish school without acquiring adequate literacy and numeracy skills, it is a good indi-cator of the quality and efficiency of the school sys-tem. Worldwide, the primary completion rate reached 92 percent in 2013. However, progress has been stag-nant in recent years, and there are large regional dif-ferences in achievement. Many children drop out of school before completion because of cost, distance, physical danger, and failure to advance.

Child malnutrition Good nutrition is the cornerstone for survival, health, and develop - ment. Well-nourished children perform better in school, grow into healthy adults, and in turn give their children a better start in life. Well-nourished women face fewer risks during pregnancy and child - birth, and their children set off on firmer developmental paths, both physically and mentally. Undernourished children have lower resis - tance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments such as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Fre - quent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth. With underweight children (low weight for age) a less prominent problem today than in the Millennium Development Goals era, both the World Health Assembly's Global Nutrition Targets 2025 and the Sustainable Development Goals have shifted focus to stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and overweight (high weight for height) in children under age 5. Estimates of wasting and severe wasting can show large fluctuations across surveys within countries. Better estimates would be based on annual incidence, but such data do not exist at national or regional level. Estimates of stunting are more stable, and thus reliable trends can be derived. Childhood stunting is a largely irreversible outcome of inadequate nutrition and repeated bouts of infection during the first 1,000 days of a child's life. Stunting has long-term effects on individuals and societies, including diminished cognitive and physical development, reduced productive capacity and poor health, and increased risk of degenerative diseases such as diabetes. Under-five mortality Mortality rates for children and others are important indicators of health status. When data on the incidence and prevalence of dis - eases are unavailable, mortality rates may be used to identify vulner - able populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries. The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or cen - suses. A complete vital registration system\u2014covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population\u2014is the best source of age-specific mortality data. But complete vital registration systems are fairly uncommon in low- and middle- income countries. Thus estimates must be obtained from sample surveys or derived by applying indirect estimation techniques to registration, census, or survey data (see Sources and methods ). Survey data are subject to recall error. To make estimates comparable and to ensure consistency across estimates by different agencies, the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, which comprises UNICEF, the WHO, the United Nations Population Division, the World Bank, and other universities and research institutes, has developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information to reconcile differences. Trend lines are obtained by fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates. (For further discussion of childhood mortality estimates, see UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation [2015]; for detailed background data and for a graphic presentation, see www.childmortality.org). Maternal mortality Measurements of maternal mortality are subject to many types of errors. In countries with incomplete vital registration systems, deaths of women of reproductive age or their pregnancy status may not be reported, or the cause of death may not be known. Even in high-income countries with reliable vital registration systems, mis - classification of maternal deaths has been found to lead to serious underestimation. Surveys and censuses can be used to measure maternal mortality by asking respondents about survivorship of sis - ters. But these estimates are retrospective, referring to a period approximately five years before the survey, and may be affected by recall error. Further, they reflect pregnancy-related deaths (deaths while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, irrespec - tive of the cause of death) and need to be adjusted to conform to the strict definition of maternal death. Maternal mortality ratios in the table are modeled estimates based on work by the WHO, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Bank, and the United Nations Population Division, and include country-level time series data. For countries without complete registration data but with other types of data and for countries with no data, maternal mortality is estimated with a multilevel regression model using available national maternal mortality data and socioeconomic information, including fertility, birth attendants, and gross domestic product. The methodology dif - fers from that used for previous estimates, so data presented here should not be compared across editions (WHO and others 2015). Adolescent fertility Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in relation to the reproductive system and its functions and pro - cesses. Means of achieving reproductive health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in low- and middle- income countries. Adolescent pregnancies are high risk for both mother and child. They are more likely to result in premature delivery, low birthweight, delivery complications, and death. Many adolescent pregnancies are unintended, but young girls may continue their pregnancies, giving up opportunities for education and employment, or seek unsafe About the data76 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 2 People abortions. Estimates of adolescent fertility rates are based on vital registration systems or, in their absence, censuses or sample sur- veys and are generally considered reliable measures of fertility in the recent past. Where no empirical information on age-specific fertility rates is available, a model is used to estimate the share of births to adolescents. For countries without vital registration systems fertility rates are generally based on extrapolations from trends observed in censuses or surveys from earlier years. Prevalence of HIV HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of HIV infection in each coun - try's population. Low national prevalence rates can be misleading, however. They often disguise epidemics that are initially concen - trated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many low- and middle- income countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable. Data on HIV prevalence are from the Joint United Nations Pro - gramme on HIV/AIDS. Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates. The models, which are updated annually, track the course of HIV epidemics and their impacts, mak - ing full use of information on HIV prevalence trends from surveil - lance data as well as survey data. The models take into account reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy (which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer) and allow for changes in urbanization over time in generalized epidemics (important because prevalence is higher in urban areas and because many countries have seen rapid urbanization over the past two decades). The estimates include plausibility bounds, available at http://data.worldbank.org, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates. Primary completion Many governments publish statistics that indicate how their educa - tion systems are working and developing\u2014statistics on enrollment, graduates, financial and human resources, and efficiency indicators such as repetition rates, pupil-teacher ratios, and cohort progres - sion. Primary completion, measured by the gross intake ratio to last grade of primary education, is a core indicator of an education system's performance. It reflects an education system's coverage and the educational attainment of students. The indicator reflects the primary cycle, which typically lasts six years (with a range of four to seven years), as defined by the Inter - national Standard Classification of Education (ISCED2011). It is a proxy that should be taken as an upper estimate of the actual primary completion rate, since data limitations preclude adjusting for students who drop out during the final year of primary education. There are many reasons why the primary completion rate may exceed 100 percent. The numerator may include late entrants and overage children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well as children who entered school early, while the denominator is the number of children at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education. Youth literacy The youth literacy rate for ages 15-24 is a standard measure of recent progress in student achievement. It reflects the accumulated outcomes of primary and secondary education by indicating the proportion of the population that has acquired basic literacy and numeracy skills over the previous 10 years or so. Conventional literacy statistics that divide the population into two groups\u2014literate and illiterate\u2014are widely available and useful for tracking global progress toward universal literacy. In practice, however, literacy is difficult to measure. Estimating literacy rates requires census or survey measurements under controlled con - ditions. Many countries report the number of literate or illiterate people from self-reported data. Some use educational attainment data as a proxy but apply different lengths of school attendance or levels of completion. And there is a trend among recent national and international surveys toward using a direct reading test of lit - eracy skills. Because definitions and methods of data collection differ across countries, data should be used cautiously. Generally, literacy encompasses numeracy, the ability to make simple arith - metic calculations. Data on youth literacy are compiled by the United Nations Educa - tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics based on national censuses and household surveys and, for countries without recent literacy data, using the Global Age- Specific Literacy Projection Model. For detailed information, see www.uis.unesco.org. Labor force participation The labor force is the supply of labor available for producing goods and services in an economy. It includes people who are currently employed, people who are unemployed but seeking work, and first- time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. There are variations in the treatment of contributing family workers and unemployed and not looking for work by country, and some coun - tries do not count members of the armed forces. Labor force size tends to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave. Data on the labor force are compiled by the International Labour Organization (ILO) from labor force surveys, censuses, and estab - lishment censuses and surveys and from administrative records such as employment exchange registers and unemployment insur - ance schemes. Labor force surveys are the most comprehensive source for internationally comparable labor force data. Labor force data from population censuses are often based on a limited number of questions on the economic characteristics of individuals, with little scope to probe. Establishment censuses and surveys provide data on the employed population only, not unemployed workers, workers in small establishments, or workers in the informal sector. World Development Indicators 2016 77 Economy States and markets Global links Back People 2 Besides the data sources, there are other important factors that affect data comparability, such as census or survey reference period, definitions, and geographic coverage. The labor force participation rates in the table are modeled esti - mates from the ILO's Key Indicators of the Labour Market, 9th edi - tion, database. These harmonized estimates use strict data selec - tion criteria and enhanced methods to ensure comparability across countries and over time to avoid the inconsistencies mentioned above. Estimates are based mainly on labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available. National estimates of labor force participation rates are available in the World Develop - ment Indicators online database. Vulnerable employment The proportion of contributing family workers and own-account workers in total employment is derived from information on sta - tus in employment. Each group faces different economic risks, and contributing family workers and own-account workers are the most vulnerable\u2014and therefore the most likely to fall into poverty. They are the least likely to have formal work arrangements, are the least likely to have social protection and safety nets to guard against economic shocks, and are often incapable of generating enough savings to offset these shocks. A high proportion of contributing family workers in a country indicates weak development, little job growth, and often a large rural economy. Data on vulnerable employment are drawn from labor force and general household surveys, censuses, and official estimates. Besides the limitation mentioned for calculating labor force par - ticipation rates, there are other reasons to limit comparability. For example, covering only civilian employment can result in an under - estimation of \"employees\" and \"workers not classified by status,\" especially in countries with large armed forces. While the categories of contributing family workers and own-account workers would not be affected, their relative shares would be. Unemployment The ILO defines the unemployed as members of the working-age population who are without work but available for and seeking work, including people who have lost their jobs or who have voluntarily left work. Some unemployment is unavoidable. At any time some workers are temporarily unemployed\u2014between jobs as employers look for the right workers and workers search for better jobs. Such unemployment, often called frictional unemployment, results from the normal operation of labor markets. Changes in unemployment over time may reflect changes in the demand for and supply of labor, but they may also reflect changes in reporting practices. In countries without unemployment or wel - fare benefits people eke out a living in the informal economy or in informal work arrangements. In countries with well developed safety nets workers can afford to wait for suitable or desirable jobs. But high and sustained unemployment indicates serious inefficiencies in resource allocation. The criteria for people considered to be seeking work, and the treatment of people temporarily laid off or seeking work for the first time, vary across countries. In many cases it is especially difficult to measure employment and unemployment in agriculture. The timing of a survey can maximize the effects of seasonal unemployment in agriculture. And informal sector employment is difficult to quantify where informal activities are not tracked. Data on unemployment are drawn from labor force surveys and general household surveys, censuses, and official estimates. Administrative records, such as social insurance statistics and employment office statistics, are also included but limited to regis - tered unemployment only. Women tend to be excluded from the unemployment count for various reasons. Women suffer more from discrimination and from structural, social, and cultural barriers that impede them from seek - ing work. Also, women are often responsible for the care of children and the elderly and for household affairs. They may not be available for work during the short reference period, as they need to make arrangements before starting work. Further, women are considered to be employed when they are working part-time or in temporary jobs, despite the instability of these jobs or their active search for more secure employment. The unemployment rates in the table are modeled estimates from the ILO's Key Indicators of the Labour Market, 9th edition, database. National estimates of unemployment are available in the World Development Indicators online database. Female legislators, senior officials, and managers Despite much progress in recent decades, gender inequalities remain pervasive in many dimensions of life. While gender inequali - ties exist throughout the world, they are most prevalent in low- income countries. Inequalities in the allocation of education, health care, nutrition, and political voice matter because of their strong association with well-being, productivity, and economic growth. These patterns of inequality begin at an early age, with boys usually receiving a larger share of education and health spending than girls, for example. The share of women in high-skilled occupations such as legislators, senior officials, and managers indicates women's status and role in the labor force and society at large. Women are vastly underrepresented in decision-making positions in government, although there is some evidence of recent improvement. Data on female legislators, senior officials, and managers are based on the employment by occupation estimates, classified according to the International Standard Classification of Occupa - tions 1988. Data are drawn mostly from labor force surveys, supple - mented in limited cases with other household surveys, population censuses, and official estimates. Countries could apply different practice whether or where the armed forces are included. Armed forces constitute a separate major group, but in some countries they 78 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 2 People are included in the most closely matching civilian occupation or in nonclassifiable workers.

Definitions Prevalence of child malnutrition, stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two stan - dard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. Data are based on the WHO child growth standards released in 2006. Under-five mortality rate is the probability of a child born in a specific year dying before reaching age 5, if subject to the age-specific mortality rates of that year. The probability is expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births. Maternal mortality ratio, modeled estimate, is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination, per 100,000 live births. Adolescent fertility rate is the number of births per 1,000 women ages 15-19. Prevalence of HIV is the percentage of people ages 15-49 who are infected with HIV. Primary completion rate, or gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education, is the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary education, regardless of age, divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education. Data limita - tions preclude adjusting for students who drop out during the final year of primary education. Youth literacy rate is the percentage of people ages 15-24 who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life. Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that engages actively in the labor market, by either working or looking for work during a reference period. Data are modeled ILO estimates. Vulnerable employment is contributing family workers and own-account workers as a percentage of total employment. Unemployment is the share of the labor force without work but available for and seeking employment. Definitions of labor force and unemployment may differ by country. Data are modeled ILO estimates. Female legislators, senior officials, and managers are the percentage of legislators, senior officials, and managers (International Standard Classification of Occupations-88 category 1) who are female.Data sources Data on prevalence of stunting are from the WHO's Global Data - base on Child Growth and Malnutrition (www.who.int/ nutgrowthdb).

They include measures of environmental goods (forest, water, cultivable land) and of degradation (pollution, deforesta - tion, loss of habitat, and loss of biodiversity). The adoption of the Sustainable Develop - ment Goals in 2015 is recognition that economic growth, poverty eradication, and environmental sustainability are intertwined; viable and long- lasting development can be ensured only by pro - tecting the environment and using its resources wisely. These global goals draw attention to a wide array of the environmental conditions that need to be closely monitored. Growing populations and expanding econo - mies have placed greater demands on land, water, forests, minerals, and energy resources. Efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustain - able economic growth are undermined by the degradation of soils, the increasing scarcity of freshwater, the overexploitation of coastal eco - systems and fisheries, the loss of forest cover, long-term changes in the Earth's climate, and the loss of biological diversity. People in extreme poverty \u2014 the roughly 700 million living on less than $1.90 a day in purchasing power parity terms in 2015 \u2014 are disproportionately affected by these adverse environmental conditions. Economic growth and greater energy use are positively correlated. Access to electric - ity and the use of energy are vital to raising standards of living. But economic growth often has negative environmental consequences, with disproportionate impacts on the poorest communities. Recognizing this, the World Bank Group has joined the United Nations Sustain - able Energy for All initiative, which calls on gov - ernments, businesses, and civil societies to achieve three goals by 2030: providing universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, doubling the share of the world's energy sup - ply from renewable sources, and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. New indicators from the Global Tracking Framework database cover these three goals and go beyond to include primary energy intensity, renewable energy consumption, renewable electricity out - put, access to electricity, and access to non - solid fuels. Other indicators in this section cover green - house gas emissions, ambient air pollution, energy (production, use, dependency, efficiency), electricity production and sources, agriculture and food production, forests and biodiversity, threatened species, water resources, climate variability, exposure to impact, resilience, urban - ization, and natural resources rents. Where pos - sible, estimates of the indicators have been drawn from international sources and have been standardized to facilitate comparisons across countries. But ecosystems span national boundaries, and access to natural resources may vary within countries. For example, water may be abundant in some parts of a country but scarce in others, and countries often share water resources. Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change are measured globally, but their effects are experienced locally.3Dominican Republic Trinidad andTobagoGrenadaSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesDominicaPuertoRico, U.S. St. Kitts and NevisAntigua andBarbuda St. Lucia Barbados de Brazil Bolivia Chile Argentina UruguayAmericanSamoa (U.S.)French Polynesia (Fr.)Bermuda(U.K.) French Guiana (U.K.)5,000 or more 2,500-4,9991,000-2,499500-999Less than 500 No dataEnergy use Energy use per capita, 2013 (kilograms of oil equivalent) IBRD 42216 84 World Development Indicators 2016Global demand for energy is surging. The share of energy production from alternative sources has increa sed slightly since 1990, but fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, supplied more than 81 per-cent of the world's total energy production in 2013. Fossil fuels are the primary source of carbon dioxide emissions, which, along with the other greenhouse gases, are believed to be the principal cause of global climate change. Producing the energy needed for growth while mitigating its effects on the world's climate is a global challenge. Because commercial energy is widely traded, its production and use need to be distinguished.

Deforestation, loss of biologically diverse habitat, depletion of water resources, pollution, urbanization, and increas - ing demand for energy production are some of the factors that must be considered when shaping development strategies. Loss of forests Forests provide habitat for many species and act as carbon sinks. If properly managed they also provide a livelihood for people who manage and use forest resources. FAO (2015) provides informa - tion on forest cover in 2015 and adjusted estimates of forest cover in 1990, 2000, and 2010. Data presented here do not distinguish natural forests from plantations, a breakdown the FAO provides only for low- and middle- income countries. Thus, data may underestimate the rate at which natural forest is disappear - ing in some countries. Habitat protection and biodiversity Deforestation is a major cause of loss of biodiversity, and habitat conservation is vital for stemming this loss. Conservation efforts have focused on protecting areas of high biodiversity. The World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) compile data on protected areas. Differences in definitions, reporting practices, and reporting peri - ods limit cross-country comparability. Nationally protected areas are defined using the six International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories for areas of at least 1,000 hectares\u2014 scientific reserves and strict nature reserves with limited public access, national parks of national or international significance and not materially affected by human activity, natural monuments and natural landscapes with unique aspects, managed nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes (which may include cultural landscapes), and areas managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural systems to ensure long-term protection and mainte - nance of biological diversity\u2014as well as terrestrial protected areas not assigned to an IUCN category. Designating an area as protected does not mean that protection is in force. For small countries with protected areas smaller than 1,000 hectares, the size limit in the definition leads to underestimation of protected areas. Due to varia - tions in consistency and methods of collection, data quality is highly variable across countries. Some countries update their information more frequently than others, some have more accurate data on the extent of coverage, and many underreport the number or extent of protected areas. Freshwater resources The data on freshwater resources are derived from estimates of runoff into rivers and recharge of groundwater. These estimates are derived from different sources and refer to different years, so cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. Data are collected intermittently and may hide substantial year-to-year varia - tions in total renewable water resources. Data do not distinguish between seasonal and geographic variations in water availability within countries. Data for small countries and countries in arid and semiarid zones are less reliable than data for larger countries and countries with greater rainfall. Water and sanitation A reliable supply of safe drinking water and sanitary disposal of excreta are two of the most important means of improving human health and protecting the environment. Improved sanitation facilities prevent human, animal, and insect contact with excreta. Data on access to an improved water source measure the per - centage of the population with ready access to water for domestic purposes and are estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation based on surveys and censuses. The coverage rates are based on information from service users on household use rather than on information from service providers, which may include nonfunctioning systems. Access to drinking water from an improved source does not ensure that the water is safe or adequate, as these characteristics are not tested at the time of survey. While information on access to an improved water source is widely used, it is extremely subjective; terms such as \"safe,\" \"improved,\" \"adequate,\" and \"reasonable\" may have different meanings in different countries despite offi - cial WHO definitions (see Definitions ). Even in high-income coun - tries treated water may not always be safe to drink. Access to an improved water source is equated with connection to a supply system; it does not account for variations in the quality and cost of the service. Urbanization There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distin - guishing urban from rural areas and, by extension, calculating their populations. Most countries use a classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. Others designate areas based on administrative arrangements. Because data are based on national definitions, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution. Air pollution Air pollution places a major burden on world health. Almost 40 per - cent of the world's people rely on wood, charcoal, dung, crop waste, or coal to meet basic energy needs. In both cities and rural areas exposure to air pollution is the main environmental threat to health, responsible for 5.5 million deaths per year, about one every 2 sec - onds. Cooking with solid fuels creates harmful smoke and particu - lates that fill homes and the surrounding environment. Long-term exposure to high levels of fine particulates in the air contributes About the data92 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 3 Environment to a range of health effects, including respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and heart disease. Not only does exposure to air pollution endanger people's health, it also carries huge economic costs and represents a drag on development, particularly for low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable segments of the population such as children and the elderly. Data on exposure to ambient air pollution are derived from esti - mates of annual concentrations of very fine particulates produced for the Global Burden of Disease study, an international scientific effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Estimates of annual concentrations are generated by combining data from atmospheric chemistry transport models and satellite observations of aerosols in the atmosphere. Modeled concentrations are calibrated against observations from ground-level monitoring of particulates at some 3,400 locations in 79 countries. Exposure to concentrations of particulates in both urban and rural areas is weighted by population and is aggregated at the national level. Pollutant concentrations are sensitive to local conditions, and even monitoring sites in the same city may register different levels. Direct monitoring of ambient PM 2.5 is still rare in many parts of the world, and measurement protocols and standards are not the same for all countries. These data should be considered only a general indication of air quality, intended for cross-country comparisons of the relative risk of particulate matter pollution. Carbon dioxide emissions Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, threatening human and natural habitats. Fossil fuel combustion and cement manu - facturing are the primary sources of anthropogenic carbon diox - ide emissions, which the U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates using data from the United Nations Statistics Division's World Energy Data Set and the U.S. Bureau of Mines's Cement Manufacturing Data Set. Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.667 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide). Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values. Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections. Esti - mates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.Energy use In most economies growth in energy use is closely related to growth in the modern sectors\u2014industry, motorized transport, and urban areas\u2014but also reflects climatic, geographic, and economic fac - tors. Energy use has been growing rapidly in low- and middle-income economies, but high-income economies still use more than four times as much energy per capita. Total energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transfor - mation to other end-use fuels (such as electricity and refined petro - leum products). It includes energy from combustible renewables and waste\u2014solid biomass and animal products, gas and liquid from biomass, and industrial and municipal waste. Biomass is any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into fuel, heat, or electricity. Data for combustible renewables and waste are often based on small surveys or other incomplete information and thus give only a broad impression of developments and are not strictly comparable across countries. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports include coun - try notes that explain some of these differences (see Data sources ). All forms of energy\u2014primary energy and primary electricity\u2014are con - verted into oil equivalents. A notional thermal efficiency of 33 percent is assumed for converting nuclear electricity into oil equivalents and 100 percent efficiency for converting hydroelectric power. Electricity production Use of energy is important in improving people's standard of liv - ing. But electricity generation also can damage the environment. Whether such damage occurs depends largely on how electricity is generated. For example, burning coal releases twice as much carbon dioxide\u2014a major contributor to global warming\u2014as does burning an equivalent amount of natural gas. Nuclear energy does not generate carbon dioxide emissions, but it produces other dan - gerous waste products. The IEA compiles data on energy inputs used to generate electric - ity. Data for countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are based on national energy data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD member governments. In addition, estimates are sometimes made to complete major aggregates from which key data are missing, and adjustments are made to compensate for dif - ferences in definitions. The IEA makes these estimates in consulta - tion with national statistical offices, oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. It occasionally revises its time series to reflect political changes. For example, the IEA has constructed historical energy statistics for countries of the former Soviet Union. In addition, energy statistics for other countries have undergone continuous changes in coverage or methodology in recent years as more detailed energy accounts have become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable. World Development Indicators 2016 93 Economy States and markets Global links Back Environment 3 Definitions Deforestation is the permanent conversion of natural forest area to other uses, including agriculture, ranching, settlements, and infrastructure. Deforested areas do not include areas logged but intended for regeneration or areas degraded by fuelwood gather - ing, acid precipitation, or forest fires. Nationally protected areas are terrestrial and marine protected areas as a percentage of total territorial area and include all nationally designated protected areas with known location and extent. All overlaps between dif - ferent designations and categories, buffered points, and polygons are removed, and all undated protected areas are dated. Internal renewable freshwater resources are the average annual flows of rivers and groundwater from rainfall in the country. Natural incom - ing flows originating outside a country's borders and overlapping water resources between surface runoff and groundwater recharge are excluded. Access to an improved water source is the per - centage of the population using an improved drinking water source. An improved drinking water source includes piped water on prem - ises (piped household water connection located inside the user's dwelling, plot, or yard), public taps or standpipes, tube wells, or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection. Access to improved sanitation facilities is the percent - age of the population using improved sanitation facilities. Improved sanitation facilities are likely to ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. They include flush/pour flush toilets (to piped sewer system, septic tank, or pit latrine), ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with slab, and composting toilets. Urban population growth is the annual rate of change of urban population assuming exponential change. Urban population is the proportion of midyear population of areas defined as urban in each country, which is obtained by the United Nations, multiplied by the World Bank estimate of total population. Ambient PM2.5 air pollution is defined as exposure to fine suspended particulates of less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter that are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing severe health damage. Data are aggregated at the national level and include both rural and urban areas. Exposure is calculated by weighting mean annual concentrations of PM 2.5 by population. Carbon dioxide emissions are emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement and include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring. Energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transformation to other end use fuels, which equals indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport. Electricity production is mea - sured at the terminals of all alternator sets in a station. In addition to hydropower, coal, oil, gas, and nuclear power generation, it covers generation by geothermal, solar, wind, and tide and wave energy as well as that from combustible renewables and waste. Production includes the output of electric plants designed to produce electricity only, as well as that of combined heat and power plants.Data sources Data on deforestation are from FAO (2015) and the FAO's website.

It includes measures of macroeconomic perfor - mance and stability as well as broader measures of income and savings adjusted for pollution, depreciation, and resource depletion. Global real gross domestic product grew 2.4 percent in 2015, to about $74 trillion in cur - rent prices, and is projected to grow 2.9 percent in 2016. Low- and middle-income economies accounted for 33 percent of the global economy in 2015, an increase of 1 percentage point. They grew an estimated 4.3 percent in 2015 and are projected to grow 4.8 percent in 2016. Expected growth in high-income economies has been revised from earlier forecasts to 1.6 percent in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2016. The adjusted net savings indicator has been updated this year with new data on the health impacts of air pollution from the Global Burden of Disease 2013, an international scientific effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evalu - ation at the University of Washington, Seattle. Damages include the costs of premature mortal - ity due to exposure to ambient particulate mat - ter, household air pollution due to cooking with solid fuels, and ambient ozone pollution. In August 2015 the International Monetary Fund began using the Government Finance Sta - tistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 framework for its Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and database. Affected series have been adjusted from 1990 onward. Historical series based on the previous (2001) framework, with data up to 2012, can be accessed through the World Devel - opment Indicators archives (http://databank .worldbank.org/data/source/WDI-Archives).GFSM 2014 provides comprehensive fiscal data through accrual reporting and allows data inconsistencies to be detected and fiscal trans - parency to be improved. In turn, fiscal analyses by end-users will be more detailed and robust. The new framework emphasizes economically meaningful fiscal indicators and allows for the phased implementation of accrual account - ing while supporting needed improvements in the compilation of cash-based fiscal statistics for the public and general government sectors and subsectors. It also harmonizes the system used to report fiscal statistics with other macro - economic statistical systems \u2014 most notably the System of National Accounts and the European System of Accounts. A key feature of GFSM 2014 is its distinc - tion between transactions and other economic flows. Transactions cover all exchanges or trans - fers that take place by mutual agreement and the consumption of fixed capital (the economic equiv - alent of \"depreciation\"). Mutual agreement does not mean that transactions have to be entered into voluntarily (the payment of taxes is treated as a transaction despite being compulsory). Addi - tionally, transactions cover monetary exchanges and in-kind activity (such as the receipt of com - modity grants and noncash remuneration). Other economic flows are the result of events that affect the value of nonfinancial assets, financial assets, and liabilities but that are not exchanges or transfers. These flows can reflect either price changes (including exchange rate movements) or volume changes due to one-off events (such as mineral discoveries or natural disasters).

As a result, fast- growing middle-income economies are closing the inc ome gap with high-income economies. But growth must be sustained over the long term, and gains must be shared to make lasting improvements to the well-being of all people. The 2007 financial crisis spread from high-income to low-income economies in 2008. A year later it became the most severe global recession in 50 years and affected sustained devel-opment around the world. Average annual per cap-ita GDP growth in low- and middle-income countries slowed from 5 percent over 2000-09 (the pre-crisis period) to 4.3 percent over 2009-14 (the post-crisis period), which was still faster than in high-income countries. High-income countries grew an average of 1.2 percent a year after the crisis, down from 1.5 percent before the crisis. The low- and middle-income countries in Middle East and North Africa saw the largest drop: Average annual per capita GDP growth fell 3.4 percentage points, from 3.1 percent in the pre-crisis period to -0.3 percent in the post-crisis period.

This rapid growth was driven by the well planned development of the hydrocarbon sector and considerable government spending on infrastructure.Sri Lanka is the fastest growing country in South Asia, with average annual per capita GDP growth of 6.7 percent in the post-crisis period, thanks to the end of three decades of civil conflict in 2009. The whole economy has been rejuvenated, with its main sectors encompassing tourism, tea export, apparel, textile, and rice production. China's economy has been slowing down: Average annual per capita GDP growth dropped from 10.2 percent pre-crisis to 7.9 percent post-crisis. This is attributable to the slowdown in property investment and shrinking exports from the manufacturing industry.After a decade of civil war, Sierra Leone has been steadily growing. Average annual per capita GDP growth reached 8.5 percent over 2009-14, compared with 3.3 percent before the crisis, supported by mineral exploration and diamond exports.

There has been progress in unifying the concepts in the system of national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance statistics, but there are many national variations in the implemen - tation of these standards. For example, even though the United Nations recommends using the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA) methodology in compiling national accounts, many are still using earlier versions, some as old as 1968. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently published a new balance of pay - ments methodology (BPM6), but many countries are still using the previous version. Similarly, the standards and definitions for govern - ment finance statistics were updated in 2014, but several countries still report using the 1986 or 2001 version. For individual country information about methodology used, refer to Sources and methods. Economic growth An economy's growth is measured by the change in the volume of its output or in the real incomes of its residents. The 2008 SNA offers three plausible indicators for calculating growth: the volume of gross domestic product (GDP), real gross domestic income, and real gross national income. Only growth in GDP is reported here. Growth rates of GDP and its components are calculated using the least squares method and constant price data in the local currency for countries and using constant price U.S. dollar series for regional and income groups. Local currency series are converted to con - stant U.S. dollars using an exchange rate in the common reference year. The growth rates are average annual and compound growth rates. Methods of computing growth are described in Sources and methods. Forecasts of growth rates come from World Bank (2016). Rebasing national accounts Rebasing of national accounts can alter the measured growth rate of an economy and lead to breaks in series that affect the consistency of data over time. When countries rebase their national accounts, they update the weights assigned to various components to better reflect current patterns of production or uses of output. The new base year should represent normal operation of the economy\u2014it should be a year without major shocks or distortions. Some coun - tries have not rebased their national accounts for many years. Using an old base year can be misleading because implicit price and vol-ume weights become progressively less relevant and useful. To obtain comparable series of constant price data for comput - ing aggregates, the World Bank rescales GDP and value added by industrial origin to a common reference year. Rescaling may result in a discrepancy between the rescaled GDP and the sum of the rescaled components. To avoid distortions in the growth rates, the discrepancy is left unallocated. As a result, the weighted average of the growth rates of the components generally does not equal the GDP growth rate.Adjusted net savings Adjusted net savings measure the change in a country's real wealth after accounting for the depreciation and depletion of a full range of assets in the economy. If a country's adjusted net savings are posi - tive and the accounting includes a sufficiently broad range of assets, economic theory suggests that the present value of social welfare is increasing. Conversely, persistently negative adjusted net savings indicate that the present value of social welfare is decreasing, sug - gesting that an economy is on an unsustainable path. Adjusted net savings are derived from standard national account - ing measures of gross savings by making four adjustments. First, estimates of fixed capital consumption of produced assets are deducted to obtain net savings. Second, current public expenditures on education are added to net savings (in standard national account - ing these expenditures are treated as consumption). Third, esti - mates of the depletion of a variety of natural resources are deducted to reflect the decline in asset values associated with their extraction and harvest. And fourth, deductions are made for damages from carbon dioxide emissions and local air pollution. Damages from local air pollution include damages from exposure to household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels, ambient concentrations of very fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 microns, and ambient ozone pollution. By accounting for the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of the envi - ronment, adjusted net savings go beyond the definition of savings or net savings in the SNA. Balance of payments The balance of payments records an economy's transactions with the rest of the world. Balance of payments accounts are divided into two groups: the current account, which records transactions in goods, services, primary income, and secondary income, and the capital and financial account, which records capital transfers, acqui - sition or disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets, and transac - tions in financial assets and liabilities. The current account balance is a more analytically useful indicator of an external imbalance. Where to draw the line for analytical purposes requires a judgment concerning the imbalance that best indicates the need for adjust - ment. There are a number of definitions in common use for this and related analytical purposes. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods. From an analytical view it is arbitrary to distinguish goods from services. For example, a unit of foreign exchange earned by a freight company strengthens the balance of payments to the same extent as the foreign exchange earned by a goods exporter. Even so, the trade balance is useful because it is often the most timely indicator of trends in the current account balance. Customs authorities are typically able to provide data on trade in goods long before data on trade in services are available. Beginning in August 2012, the International Monetary Fund imple - mented the Balance of Payments Manual 6 (BPM6) framework in its About the data106 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 4 Economy major statistical publications. The World Bank implemented BPM6 in its online databases and publications in April 2013. Balance of pay - ments data for 2005 onward are presented in accord with the BPM6. The historical BPM5 data series will end with data for 2008, which can be accessed through the World Development Indicators archives (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/WDI-Archives). The complete balance of payments methodology can be accessed at www.imf.org/external/np/sta/bop/bop.htm. Government finance In August 2015 the International Monetary Fund began using the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 framework for its Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and database. The 2014 framework will be implemented in World Development Indicators from April 2016 onward; affected series will be adjusted from 1990 onward. Historical series based on the previous (2001) framework, with data up to 2012, can be accessed through the World Develop - ment Indicators archives. The GFSM 2014 framework addresses the measurement of important international economic developments that have taken place in recent years, including through improved recording and methodological treatment of various types of events. The changes include methodological changes in the 2008 SNA, clarifications of existing methodological guidelines, presentational changes, and editorial changes. It aims to harmonize, to the extent possible, the guidelines with the 2008 SNA, the BPM6, and the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. For debt-related issues GFSM 2014 is supplemented with the Public Sector Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users. Furthermore, efforts to harmonize statis - tical reporting and financial reporting, and new developments in the International Public Sector Accounting Standards, have led to additional changes. Some differences remain between GFSM 2014 and the SNA, particularly in how some government production activities are treated, because they serve different analytic purposes. GFSM 2014 measures the impact of economic events such as taxing, spending, borrowing, and lending on government finances and on the remainder of the economy. The SNA measures production and consumption of goods and services and the savings and invest - ment created in doing so. As a result, the treatment of some government production activities differs in GFSM 2014 from the treatment of those activities in the 2008 SNA. The complete GFSM 2014 can be accessed at www.imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/GFS /Manual/2014/gfsfinal.pdf. For most countries central government finance data have been consolidated into one account, but for others only budgetary cen - tral government accounts are available. Countries reporting bud - getary data are noted in Sources and methods. Because budgetary accounts may not include all central government units (such as social security funds), they usually provide an incomplete picture. In federal states the central government accounts provide an incom - plete view of total public finance. Data on government revenue and expense are collected by the IMF through questionnaires to member countries and by the Organisa - tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Despite IMF efforts to standardize data collection, statistics are often incom - plete, untimely, and not comparable across countries. Government finance statistics are reported in local currency. The indicators here are shown as percentages of GDP. Many countries report government finance data by fiscal year; see Sources and meth - ods for information on fiscal year end by country. Financial accounts Money and the financial accounts that record the supply of money lie at the heart of a country's financial system. There are several commonly used definitions of the money supply. The narrowest, M1, encompasses currency held by the public and demand deposits with banks. M2 includes M1 plus time and savings deposits with banks that require prior notice for withdrawal. M3 includes M2 as well as various money market instruments, such as certificates of deposit issued by banks, bank deposits denominated in foreign currency, and deposits with financial institutions other than banks. However defined, money is a liability of the banking system, distinguished from other bank liabilities by the special role it plays as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. A general and continuing increase in an economy's price level is called inflation. The increase in the average prices of goods and services in the economy should be distinguished from a change in the relative prices of individual goods and services. Generally accompanying an overall increase in the price level is a change in the structure of relative prices, but it is only the average increase, not the relative price changes, that constitutes inflation. A commonly used measure of inflation is the consumer price index, which mea - sures the prices of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by a typical household. The consumer price index is usu - ally calculated on the basis of periodic surveys of consumer prices. Other price indices are derived implicitly from indexes of current and constant price series. Consumer price indexes are produced more frequently and so are more current. They are constructed explicitly, using surveys of the cost of a defined basket of consumer goods and services. Nevertheless, consumer price indexes should be interpreted with caution. The definition of a household, the basket of goods, and the geographic (urban or rural) and income group coverage of consumer price surveys can vary widely by country. In addition, weights are derived from household expenditure surveys, which, for budgetary reasons, tend to be conducted infrequently in the poorest countries, impairing comparability over time. Although useful for measuring consumer price inflation within a country, consumer price indexes are of less value in comparing countries. World Development Indicators 2016 107 Economy States and markets Global links BackEconomy 4 Definitions Gross domestic product (GDP) at purchaser prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output. It is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated capital assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Value added is the net output of an industry after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. Gross savings are the difference between gross national income and public and private consump - tion, plus net current transfers. Adjusted net savings measure the change in value of a specified set of assets, excluding capital gains. They are net savings plus education expenditure minus energy deple - tion, mineral depletion, net forest depletion, and carbon dioxide and local air pollution damage. Current account balance is the sum of net exports of goods and services, net primary income, and net secondary income. Central government cash surplus or deficit is revenue (including grants) minus expense, minus net acquisition of nonfinancial assets. This cash surplus or deficit is close to the earlier overall budget balance (still missing is lending minus repayments, which are included as a financing item under net acquisition of finan - cial assets). Central government debt is the entire stock of direct government fixed-term contractual obligations to others outstanding on a particular date. It includes domestic and foreign liabilities such as currency and money deposits, securities other than shares, and loans. It is the gross amount of government liabilities reduced by the amount of equity and financial derivatives held by the government. Because debt is a stock rather than a flow, it is measured as of a given date, usually the last day of the fiscal year. Consumer price index reflects changes in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or may change at specified intervals, such as yearly. The Laspeyres formula is generally used. Broad money (IFS line 35L..ZK) is the sum of currency outside banks; demand deposits other than those of the central government; the time, savings, and foreign currency deposits of resident sectors other than the central government; bank and traveler's checks; and other securities such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Data sources Data on GDP for most countries are collected from national statisti - cal organizations and central banks by visiting and resident World Bank missions; data for selected high-income economies are from the OECD. Data on gross savings are from World Bank national accounts data files. Data on adjusted net savings are based on a conceptual underpinning by Hamilton and Clemens (1999). Data on consump - tion of fixed capital are from the United Nations Statistics Division's National Accounts Statistics: Main Aggregates and Detailed Tables, the OECD's National Accounts Statistics database, and the Penn World Table (Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmler 2013), with missing data esti - mated by World Bank staff. Data on education expenditure are from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics, with missing data estimated by World Bank staff. Data on forest, energy, and mineral depletion are based on the sources and methods described in World Bank (2011). Additional data on energy commodity production and reserves are from the United States Energy Information Administration. Estimates of damages from carbon dioxide emissions follow the method of Fankhauser (1994) using data from the International Energy Agency's CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion Statistics database. Data on exposure to household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, and ambient ozone are from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Bur - den of Disease 2013 study. Data on current account balances are from the IMF's Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and International Financial Statistics. Data on central government finances are from the IMF's Government Finance Statistics database. Data on the consumer price index are from the IMF's International Financial Statistics. Data on broad money are from the IMF's monthly International Financial Statistics and annual International Financial Statistics Yearbook. References De la Torre, A., E. L. Yeyati, and S.

These indicators measure the business environment, government functions, financial sys - tem development, infrastructure, information and communication technology, science and technol - ogy, government and policy performance, and con - ditions in fragile countries with weak institutions. This year, stock market data from the World Federation of Exchanges replaces estimates from Standard and Poor's, which discontinued the Global Stock Markets Factbook in 2013, for indicators of listed companies, market capitaliza - tion, the value of shares traded, and the turn - over ratio. Time series go back to 1975 where available; additional data, including indicators on fixed income and derivatives and equity mar - kets can be found on the World Federation of Exchanges website (www.world-exchanges.org). Stock market size can be measured in vari - ous ways, and each produces a different ranking of countries. Both number of listed companies and market capitalization measure market size and are positively correlated with the ability to mobilize capital and diversify risk. Market liquid - ity is measured by the value of shares traded, which represents the transfer of ownership effected automatically through the exchange's electronic order book. Finally, turnover velocity is the ratio between the electronic order book turnover of domestic shares, and their market capitalization; only domestic shares are used in order to be consistent between exchanges. The data for market capitalization and listed domestic companies are provided for each exchange, and World Development Indicators uses two approaches to calculate country-level esti - mates. When there is only one reported exchange in a country, its data was used to represent that country. When there are several exchanges in a country, care was taken to avoid double-counting; for example, where companies are listed on more than one exchange in the country, the exchange that provided the most comprehensive data set was used. When different companies are listed on the exchanges, the data for number of listed com - panies and domestic market capitalization have been aggregated to obtain country-level figures. States and markets also includes the latest updates to data on business regulations and the business environment, from the Doing Business initiative and Enterprise Surveys. This year, there are new measures of regulatory quality in register - ing property, dealing with construction permits, obtaining electricity, and enforcing contracts. A new indicator of public-private partnerships has also been added to complement existing data on private participation in telecommunica - tions, energy, transport, and water and sanitation infrastructure projects. Public-private partnership projects refer to brownfield concessions, green - field projects, and management and leases but excludes merchants where private parties assume the risks without government guarantee. Public- private partnership projects help determine the gap between infrastructure demand and available resources, thus making important contributions to improving the efficiency of public services in infrastructure and extending delivery to poor peo - ple. As in previous editions, the latest trend data on various indicators related to information and communications technology are also presented, including goods trade, telecommunications rev - enue, mobile subscriptions, and Internet use.5Dominican Republic Trinidad andTobagoGrenadaSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesDominicaPuertoRico, U.S. St. Kitts and NevisAntigua andBarbuda St. Lucia Barbados R.B. de VenezuelaU.S. Brazil Bolivia Chile Argentina UruguayAmericanSamoa (U.S.)French Polynesia (Fr.)Bermuda(U.K.) French Guiana (U.K.)80 or more 60-7940-5920-39Less than 20 No dataInternet users Individuals using the Internet, 2014 (% of population) IBRD 41454 112 World Development Indicators 2016The digital and information revolution has changed the way the world learns, communicates, does busi-ness, and t reats illnesses. Information and communi- cation technologies offer vast opportunities for prog-ress in all walks of life in all countries \u2014 opportunities for economic growth, improved health, better service delivery, learning through distance education, and social and cultural advances. The Internet delivers information to schools and hospitals, improves public and private services, and increases productivity and participation. Through mobile phones, Internet access is expanding in low- and middle-income countries. The mobility, ease of use, flexible deployment, and declin-ing rollout costs of wireless technologies enable mobile communications to reach rural populations. According to the International Teleco mmunication Union, by the end of 2015 the number of Internet users worldwide reached 3.2 billion.

Data on business entry density are from the World Bank's 2015 Entrepreneurship Database, which includes indicators for more than 150 countries for 2004-14. Survey data are used to analyze firm creation, its relationship to eco - nomic growth and poverty reduction, and the impact of regulatory and institutional reforms. Data on total registered businesses were col - lected from national registrars of companies. For cross-country com - parability, only limited liability corporations that operate in the formal sector are included. For additional information on sources, methodol - ogy, calculation of entrepreneurship rates, and data limitations see www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/entrepreneurship. Data on time required to start a business are from the Doing Busi - ness database, whose indicators measure business regulation, gauge regulatory outcomes, and measure the extent of legal protection of property, the flexibility of employment regulation, and the tax burden on businesses. The fundamental premise is that economic activity requires good rules and regulations that are efficient, accessible, and easy to implement. Some indicators give a higher score for more regulation, such as stricter disclosure requirements in related-party transactions, and others give a higher score for simplified regulations, such as a one-stop shop for completing business startup formalities. There are 11 sets of indicators covering starting a business, register - ing property, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, enforcing contracts, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, resolving insolvency, and employing workers. The indicators are available at www.doingbusiness.org. Doing Business data are collected with a standardized survey that uses a simple business case to ensure comparability across economies and over time\u2014with assumptions about the legal form of the business, its size, its location, and nature of its operation. Surveys in 189 countries are administered through more than 10,700 local experts, including lawyers, business consultants, accountants, freight forwarders, government officials, and other professionals who routinely administer or advise on legal and regulatory requirements. Over the past two years Doing Business has introduced important improvements in 8 of the 10 sets of Doing Business indicators to provide a new conceptual framework in which the emphasis on efficiency of regulation is complemented by increased emphasis on quality of regulation. Moreover, Doing Business has changed the basis for the ease of doing business ranking, from the percentile rank to the distance to frontier score. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to a measure of regulatory best practice\u2014showing the gap between each economy's performance and the best performance on each indicator. This measure captures more information than the simple rankings previously used as the basis because it shows not only how economies are ordered on their performance on the indicators, but also how far apart they are. The Doing Business methodology has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the data. First, the data collected refer to businesses in the economy's largest business city and may not represent regulations in other locations of the economy. To address this limitation, subnational indicators are being collected for selected economies, and coverage has been extended to the second largest business city in economies with a population of more than 100 million. Subnational indicators point to substantial differences in the speed of reform and the ease of doing business across cities in the same economy. Second, the data often focus on a specific business form\u2014generally a limited liability company of a specified size\u2014and may not represent regulation for other types of businesses such as sole proprietorships. Third, transactions described in a standardized business case refer to a specific set of issues and may not represent all the issues a business encounters. Fourth, the time measures involve an element of judgment by the expert respondents. When sources indicate different estimates, the Doing Business time indicators represent the median values of several responses given under the assumptions of the standard - ized case. Fifth, the methodology assumes that a business has full information on what is required and does not waste time in complet - ing procedures. In constructing the indicators, it is assumed that entrepreneurs know about all regulations and comply with them. In practice, entrepreneurs may not be aware of all required procedures or may avoid legally required procedures altogether. Financial systems The development of an economy's financial markets is closely related to its overall development. Well functioning financial systems provide good and easily accessible information. That lowers transaction costs, which in turn improves resource allocation and boosts economic growth (Beck and Levine 2001). At low levels of economic development com - mercial banks tend to dominate the financial system, while at higher levels domestic stock markets become more active and efficient. Open economies with sound macroeconomic policies, good legal systems, and shareholder protection attract capital and thus have larger financial markets (Claessens, Klingebiel, and Schmukler 2002). The table includes market capitalization as a share of GDP as a measure of stock market size. Market size can be measured in other ways that may produce a different ranking of countries. Recent research on stock market development shows that modern communi - cations technology and increased financial integration have resulted in more cross-border capital flows, a stronger presence of financial firms around the world, and the migration of trading activities to international exchanges. Many firms in emerging markets now cross- list on international exchanges, which provides them with lower cost capital and more liquidity-traded shares. However, this also means that exchanges in emerging markets may not have enough financial activity to sustain them. Comparability across countries may be lim - ited by conceptual and statistical weaknesses, such as inaccurate reporting and differences in accounting standards. Domestic credit provided by the financial sector as a share of GDP measures banking sector depth and financial sector development in About the data120 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 5 States and markets terms of size. Data are taken from the financial corporation survey of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) International Financial Sta - tistics or, when unavailable, from its depository corporation survey. The financial corporation survey includes monetary authorities (the central bank), deposit money banks, and other banking institutions, such as finance companies, development banks, and savings and loan institutions. In a few countries governments may hold inter - national reserves as deposits in the banking system rather than in the central bank. Claims on the central government are a net item (claims on the central government minus central government deposits) and thus may be negative, resulting in a negative value for domestic credit provided by the financial sector. Tax revenues Taxes are the main source of revenue for most governments. Tax revenue as a share of GDP provides a quick overview of the fiscal obligations and incentives facing the private sector across coun - tries. The table shows only central government data, which may significantly understate the total tax burden, particularly in countries where provincial and municipal governments are large or have con - siderable tax authority. Data are based on the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Low ratios of tax revenue to GDP may reflect weak administration and large-scale tax avoidance or evasion. Low ratios may also reflect a sizable parallel economy with unrecorded and undisclosed incomes. Tax revenue ratios tend to rise with income, with higher income coun - tries relying on taxes to finance a much broader range of social ser - vices and social security than lower income countries are able to. Military expenditures Although national defense is an important function of government, high expenditures for defense or civil conflicts burden the economy and may impede growth. Military expenditures as a share of GDP are a rough indicator of the portion of national resources used for military activities. As an \"input\" measure, military expenditures are not directly related to the \"output\" of military activities, capabilities, or security. Comparisons across countries should take into account many factors, including historical and cultural traditions, the length of borders that need defending, the quality of relations with neigh - bors, and the role of the armed forces in the body politic. Data are from the Stockholm International Peace Research Insti - tute (SIPRI), whose primary source of military expenditure data is official data provided by national governments. These data are derived from budget documents, defense white papers, and other public documents from official government agencies, including government responses to questionnaires sent by SIPRI, the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Secondary sources include international statistics, such as those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Other secondary sources include country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit, country reports by IMF staff, and spe - cialist journals and newspapers. In the many cases where SIPRI cannot make independent estimates, it uses country-provided data. Because of differences in definitions and the difficulty of verifying the accuracy and completeness of data, data are not always comparable across countries. However, SIPRI puts a high priority on ensuring that the data series for each country is com - parable over time. More information on SIPRI's military expenditure project can be found at www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex. Infrastructure The quality of an economy's infrastructure, including information and communications technology, is an important element in investment decisions and economic development. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that there were 7 billion mobile subscriptions globally in 2015. No tech - nology has ever spread faster around the world. Mobile communica - tions have a particularly important impact in rural areas. The mobil - ity, ease of use, flexible deployment, and relatively low and declining rollout costs of wireless technologies enable them to reach rural populations with low levels of income and literacy. The next billion mobile subscribers will consist mainly of the rural poor. Operating companies have traditionally been the main source of telecommunications data, so information on subscriptions has been widely available for most countries. This gives a general idea of access, but a more precise measure is the penetration rate\u2014the share of households with access to telecommunications. During the past few years more information on information and communication technology use has become available from household and business surveys. Also important are data on actual use of telecommunications services. The quality of data varies among reporting countries as a result of differ - ences in regulations covering data provision and availability. High-technology exports The method for determining high-technology exports was developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in collaboration with Eurostat. It takes a \"product approach\" (rather than a \"sectoral approach\") based on research and development intensity (expenditure divided by total sales) for groups of products from Ger - many, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology prod - ucts may also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade. The method takes only research and development intensity into account, but other characteris - tics of high technology are also important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents. Considering these characteristics would yield a different list (see Hatzichronoglou 1997). Statistical capacity Statistical capacity is a country's ability to collect, analyze, and disseminate high-quality data about its population and economy. World Development Indicators 2016 121 Economy States and markets Global links Back States and markets 5 When statistical capacity improves and policy makers use accurate statistics to inform their decisions, this results in better develop - ment policy design and outcomes. The Statistical Capacity Indica - tor is an essential tool for monitoring and tracking the statistical capacity of low- and middle- income countries and helps national statistics offices worldwide identify gaps in their capabilities to col - lect, produce, and use data. Definitions Business entry density is the number of newly registered limited liability corporations per 1,000 people ages 15-64. Time required to start a business is the number of calendar days to complete the procedures for legally operating a business using the fastest proce - dure, independent of cost. Stock market capitalization is the share price times the number of shares outstanding (including their several classes) for listed domestic companies. Investment funds, unit trusts, and companies whose only business goal is to hold shares of other listed companies are excluded. Domestic credit provided by finan - cial sector is all credit to various sectors on a gross basis, except to the central government, which is net. The financial sector includes monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and other banking institu - tions for which data are available. Tax revenue collected by central government is compulsory transfers to the central government for public purposes. Certain compulsory transfers such as fines, penal - ties, and most social security contributions are excluded. Refunds and corrections of erroneously collected tax revenue are treated as negative revenue. The analytic framework of the IMF's Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) is based on accrual accounting and balance sheets. For countries still reporting govern - ment finance data on a cash basis, the IMF adjusts reported data to the GFSM 2001 accrual framework. These countries are footnoted in the table. Military expenditures are SIPRI data derived from NATO's former definition (in use until 2002), which includes all current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces; defense ministries and other government agencies engaged in defense projects; paramilitary forces, if judged to be trained and equipped for military operations; and military space activities. Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions and social services for military personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activi - ties, such as for veterans benefits, demobilization, and weapons con - version and destruction. This definition cannot be applied for all coun - tries, however, since that would require more detailed information than is available about military budgets and off-budget military expenditures (for example, whether military budgets cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, and military pen - sions). Mobile cellular subscriptions are the number of subscrip - tions to a public mobile telephone service that provides access to the public switched telephone network using cellular technology. Postpaid subscriptions and active prepaid accounts (that is, accounts that have been used during the last three months) are included. The indicator applies to all mobile cellular subscriptions that offer voice communica - tions and excludes subscriptions for data cards or USB modems, sub - scriptions to public mobile data services, private-trunked mobile radio, telepoint, radio paging, and telemetry services. Individuals using the Internet are the percentage of individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 12 months. Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital television, or similar device. High-technology exports are products with high research and development intensity, such as in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery. Overall statistical capacity is the composite score assessing the capacity of a country's statistical system. It is based on a diagnostic framework that assesses methodology, data sources, and periodicity and timeliness. Countries are scored against 25 criteria in these areas, using publicly available information and country input. The overall statistical capacity score is then calculated as simple average of all three area scores on a scale of 0-100.

As national economies develop, their links expand and grow more com - plex. The indicators in Global links measure the size and direction of these flows and document the effects of policy interventions, such as tar - iffs, trade facilitation, and aid flows, on the devel - opment of the world economy. The accommodative monetary policy imple - mented by the major central banks in 2014 through unchanged interest rates lowered risk premiums, improved liquidity in financial markets, and supported economic growth. However, global markets remain surrounded by uncertainties related to geopolitical tension in some regions. International lending to low- and middle-income economies fell 18 percent in 2014, driven by a sharp 60 percent contraction in short-term debt, reflecting fresh turbulence and uncertainty in the global economy. Just over half of long-term debt inflows went to nonguaranteed private sector bor - rowers, compared with 62 percent in 2013. Bond issuance by public and private entities remained an important source of external financing, totaling $242 billion in 2014. There was also an impor - tant shift in borrower composition: bond issu - ance by public sector borrowers rose 32 percent to $146 billion, equivalent to 60 percent of total bond issuance in 2014 (compared with 46 percent in 2013). A principal driver was the purchase of domestically issued bonds by nonresidents. Global inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) declined 20 percent in 2014, due mainly to a 30 percent decrease into high-income economies. FDI inflows to these economies amounted to $899 billion, only 36 percent of the levels prior to the financial crisis. FDI inflows into low- and middle-income countries proved more resilient and were about 4 percent higher than 2013 levels, accounting for more than 40 percent of global FDI. Investors continue to be attracted by improved business and regula - tory environments, growth prospects, and buoy - ant and expanding domestic markets. Although many economies receive FDI, flows remain highly concentrated: Brazil, China, and India account for more than half. Global portfolio equity flows rebounded sub - stantially, with an overall annual increase of 41 percent at the end of 2014. Equity flows to high-income economies increased 42 percent, and equity flows to middle-income economies increased 27 percent. Investors sought emerg - ing markets perceived as offering high returns, leading to some diversification in the destination of portfolio equity flows, but in general portfo - lio equity flows remained highly concentrated in only a handful of middle-income countries. China recorded a 58 percent increase in net portfo - lio equity flows, to $52 billion; India recorded a 40 percent decline, to $12 billion; and Brazil's net inflows remained unchanged, at $12 billion. In 2014 inflows of international personal remittances totaled $528 billion, a 6 percent increase over 2013. Personal remittances are calculated in balance of payments statistics as the sum of personal transfers (payments between resident and non resident individuals) and compensation of employees (the income of short-term nonresident workers and of residents employed by nonresident entities). Some 72 per - cent ($378 billion) of personal remittances were received by low- and middle- income economies. High-income economies received $150 billion, mostly as compensation of employees; the three top receivers, with about 37 percent, were Bel - gium, France, and Germany.6Dominican Republic Trinidad andTobagoGrenadaSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesDominicaPuertoRico, U.S. St. Kitts and NevisAntigua andBarbuda St. Lucia Barbados R.B. de VenezuelaU.S. Brazil Bolivia Chile Argentina UruguayAmericanSamoa (U.S.)French Polynesia (Fr.)Bermuda(U.K.) French Guiana (U.K.)6.0 or more 4.0-5.92.0-3.91.0-1.9Less than 1.0 No dataForeign direct investment Foreign direct investment net inflows, 2014 (% of GDP) IBRD 41455 126 World Development Indicators 2016Over the past decade flows of foreign direct invest- ment (FDI) to low- and middle-income economies have increa sed substantially. It has long been recognized that FDI flows can carry the benefits of knowledge and technology transfer to domestic firms and the labor force, productivity spillover, enhanced competition, and improved access for exports abroad. Moreover, they are the preferred source of capital for financing a cur-rent account deficit because FDI is non-debt- creating. Global inflows of FDI decl ined 20 percent in 20 1 4 , to $1.6 trillion, due mainly to a 30 percent decrease into high-income economies. Low- and middle- income economies continued to prove more resilient, with FDI inflows decreasing only 1.4 percent.

The historical data series based on BPM5 ends with data for 2005. Balance of payments data from 2005 forward have been presented in accord with the BPM6 meth - odology, which can be accessed at www.imf.org/external/np/sta /bop/bop.htm. Trade in goods Data on merchandise trade are from customs reports of goods moving into or out of an economy or from reports of financial transactions related to merchandise trade recorded in the balance of payments. Because of differences in timing and definitions, trade flow estimates from customs reports and balance of pay - ments may differ. Several international agencies process trade data, each correcting unreported or misreported data, leading to other differences. The most detailed source of data on interna - tional trade in goods is the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity Trade Statistics (Comtrade) database. The IMF and the World Trade Organization also collect customs-based data on trade in goods. The \"terms of trade\" index measures the relative prices of a coun - try's exports and imports. The most common way to calculate terms of trade is the net barter (or commodity) terms of trade index, or the ratio of the export price index to the import price index. When a country's net barter terms of trade index increases, its exports have become more expensive or its imports cheaper. Tourism Tourism is defined as the activity of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for no more than one year for leisure, business, and other purposes not related to an activity remunerated from within the place visited. Data on inbound and outbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals and departures, not to the number of unique individuals. Thus a person who makes several trips to a country during a given period is counted each time as a new arrival. Data on inbound tourism show the arrivals of nonresident tourists (overnight visitors) at national borders. When data on international tourists are unavailable or incomplete, the table shows the arrivals of international visitors, which include tour - ists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members. The aggregates are calculated using the World Bank's weighted aggre - gation methodology (see Sources and methods ) and differ from the World Tourism Organization's aggregates. For tourism expenditure, the World Tourism Organization uses bal - ance of payments data from the IMF supplemented by data from individual countries. These data, shown in the table, include travel and passenger transport items as defined by the BPM6. When the IMF does not report data on passenger transport items, expenditure data for travel items are shown.Official development assistance Data on official development assistance received refer to aid to eligible countries from members of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), multilateral organizations, and non-DAC donors. Data do not reflect aid given by recipient countries to other low- and middle- income countries or distinguish among types of aid (pro - gram, project, or food aid; emergency assistance; or postconflict peacekeeping assistance), which may have different effects on the economy. Ratios of aid to gross national income (GNI), gross capital for - mation, imports, and government spending measure a country's dependency on aid. Care must be taken in drawing policy conclu - sions. For foreign policy reasons some countries have traditionally received large amounts of aid. Thus aid dependency ratios may reveal as much about a donor's interests as about a recipient's needs. Increases in aid dependency ratios can reflect events affect - ing both the numerator (aid) and the denominator (GNI). Data are based on information from donors and may not be con - sistent with information recorded by recipients in the balance of payments, which often excludes all or some technical assistance\u2014 particularly payments to expatriates made directly by the donor. Similarly, grant commodity aid may not always be recorded in trade data or in the balance of payments. DAC statistics exclude aid for military and antiterrorism purposes. The aggregates refer to World Bank classifications of economies and therefore may differ from those reported by the OECD. Migration and personal remittances The movement of people, most often through migration, is a signifi - cant part of global integration. Migrants contribute to the economies of both their host country and their country of origin. Yet reliable sta - tistics on migration are difficult to collect and are often incomplete, making international comparisons a challenge. Since data on emigrant stock is difficult for countries to collect, the United Nations Population Division provides data on net migra - tion, taking into account the past migration history of a country or area, the migration policy of a country, and the influx of refugees in recent periods to derive estimates of net migration. The data to calculate these estimates come from various sources, including border statistics, administrative records, surveys, and censuses. When there are insufficient data, net migration is derived through the difference between the growth rate of a country's population over a certain period and the rate of natural increase of that popu - lation (itself being the difference between the birth rate and the death rate). Migrants often send funds back to their home countries, which are recorded as personal transfers in the balance of payments. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and nonresident individuals, independent of the source of income of the sender (irrespective of whether the sender receives income from About the data134 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ? 6 Global links labor, entrepreneurial or property income, social benefits, or any other types of transfers or disposes of assets) and the relationship between the households (irrespective of whether they are related or unrelated individuals). Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by nonresident entities. Compensation of employees has three main components: wages and salaries in cash, wages and salaries in kind, and employers' social contributions. Personal remittances are the sum of personal transfers and compensation of employees. Equity flows Equity flows comprise foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity. The internationally accepted definition of FDI (from BPM6) includes the following components: equity investment, including investment associated with equity that gives rise to control or influ - ence; investment in indirectly influenced or controlled enterprises; investment in fellow enterprises; debt (except selected debt); and reverse investment. The Framework for Direct Investment Relation - ships provides criteria for determining whether cross-border owner - ship results in a direct investment relationship, based on control and influence. Direct investments may take the form of greenfield investment, where the investor starts a new venture in a foreign country by con - structing new operational facilities; joint venture, where the inves - tor enters into a partnership agreement with a company abroad to establish a new enterprise; or merger and acquisition, where the investor acquires an existing enterprise abroad. The IMF suggests that investments should account for at least 10 percent of voting stock to be counted as FDI. In practice many countries set a higher threshold. Many countries fail to report reinvested earnings, and the definition of long-term loans differs among countries. Portfolio equity investment is defined as cross-border transac - tions and positions involving equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Equity securities are equity instruments that are negotiable and designed to be traded, usually on organized exchanges or \"over the counter.\" The negotia - bility of securities facilitates trading, allowing securities to be held by different parties during their lives. Negotiability allows investors to diversify their portfolios and to withdraw their investment read - ily. Included in portfolio investment are investment fund shares or units (that is, those issued by investment funds) that are evidenced by securities and that are not reserve assets or direct investment. Although they are negotiable instruments, exchange-traded financial derivatives are not included in portfolio investment because they are in their own category. External debt External indebtedness affects a country's creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Data on external debt are gathered through the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS). Indebtedness is calculated using loan-by-loan reports submitted by countries on long-term public and publicly guaranteed borrowing and using infor - mation on short-term debt collected by the countries, from creditors through the reporting systems of the Bank for International Settle - ments, or based on national data from the World Bank's Quarterly External Debt Statistics. These data are supplemented by informa - tion from major multilateral banks and official lending agencies in major creditor countries. Currently, 120 low- and middle- income countries report to the DRS. Debt data are reported in the cur - rency of repayment and compiled and published in U.S. dollars. End-of-period exchange rates are used for the compilation of stock figures (amount of debt outstanding), and projected debt service and annual average exchange rates are used for the flows. Exchange rates are taken from the IMF's International Financial Statistics. Debt repayable in multiple currencies, goods, or services and debt with a provision for maintenance of the value of the currency of repayment are shown at book value. While data related to public and publicly guaranteed debt are reported to the DRS on a loan-by-loan basis, data on long-term private nonguaranteed debt are reported annually in aggregate by the country or estimated by World Bank staff for countries. Private nonguaranteed debt is estimated based on national data from the World Bank's Quarterly External Debt Statistics. Total debt service as a share of exports of goods, services, and primary income provides a measure of a country's ability to service its debt out of export earnings. World Development Indicators 2016 135 Global links 6 Economy States and markets Global links BackDefinitions Merchandise trade includes all trade in goods and excludes trade in services. Net barter terms of trade index is the percent - age ratio of the export unit value indexes to the import unit value indexes, measured relative to the base year 2000. Inbound tour - ism expenditure is expenditures by international inbound visitors, including payments to national carriers for international transport and any other prepayment made for goods or services received in the destination country. They may include receipts from same-day visitors, except when these are important enough to justify sepa - rate classification. Data include travel and passenger transport items as defined by BPM6. When passenger transport items are not reported, expenditure data for travel items are shown. Exports refer to all transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world involving a change of ownership from residents to non - residents of general merchandise, goods sent for processing and repairs, nonmonetary gold, and services. Net official development assistance is flows (net of repayment of principal) that meet the DAC definition of official development assistance and are made to coun - tries and territories on the DAC list of aid recipients, divided by World Bank estimates of GNI. Net migration is the net total of migrants (immigrants less emigrants, including both citizens and noncitizens) during the period. Data are five-year estimates. Personal remit - tances, received, are the sum of personal transfers (current trans - fers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households) and compensation of employees (remuneration for the labor input to the production process contrib - uted by an individual in an employer-employee relationship with the enterprise). Foreign direct investment is cross-border investment associated with a resident in one economy having control or a signifi - cant degree of influence on the management of an enterprise that is resident in another economy. Portfolio equity is net inflows from equity securities other than those recorded as direct investment or reserve assets, including shares, stocks, depository receipts, and direct purchases of shares in local stock markets by foreign inves - tors Total external debt stock is debt owed to nonresident credi - tors and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services by public and private entities in the country. It is the sum of long-term external debt, short-term debt, and use of IMF credit. Total debt service is the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in foreign currency, goods, or services on long-term debt; interest paid on short-term debt; and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF. Exports of goods and services and primary income are the total value of exports of goods and services, receipts of compensation of nonresident workers, and primary investment income from abroad.Data sources Data on merchandise trade are from the World Trade Organization.

This section describes some of the statis - tical practices and procedures used in prepar - ing World Development Indicators. It covers data consistency, reliability, comparability, reporting standards of key indicators, and the methods employed for calculating regional and income group aggregates and for calculating growth rates. It also describes the World Bank Atlas method for deriving the conversion factor used to estimate gross national income (GNI) and GNI per capita in U.S. dollars. Other statistical pro - cedures and calculations are described in the About the data sections following each table. Additional documentation and metadata are available in the World Development Indicators database at http://databank.worldbank.org/wdi and from a dashboard of the statistical capacity of countries at http://datatopics.worldbank.org /statisticalcapacity. Data availability, reliability, and comparabilityMany factors affect data availability, reliability, and comparability. Statistical systems in many of the poorest countries are limited; statistical methods, coverage, practices, and definitions differ widely; and cross-country and intertempo - ral comparisons involve complex technical and conceptual problems that cannot be resolved unequivocally. Data relevant at the national level may not be suitable for standardized inter - national use due to methodological concerns or the lack of clear documentation. Delays in reporting data and the use of old surveys as the basis for current estimates may further compromise the quality of data reported. Data coverage may not be complete because of spe - cial circumstances affecting the collection and reporting of data, such as problems stemming from conflicts. Considerable effort has been made to stan - dardize the data, but full comparability cannot be assured, so care must be taken in interpret-ing the indicators. Although drawn from sources thought to be the most authoritative, data should be understood only as indicating trends and characterizing major differences among econo - mies rather than as offering precise quantitative measures of those differences.

Price indexes derived from national accounts aggregates, such as the implicit deflator for gross domestic product (GDP), express the price level relative to base year prices. Reference year is the year in which the local currency constant price series of a coun - try is valued. The reference year is usually the same as the base year used to report the constant price series. However, when the constant price data are chain linked, the base year is changed annually, so the data are res - caled to a specific reference year to provide a consis - tent time series. When the country has not rescaled following a change in base year, World Bank staff res - cale the data to maintain a longer historical series. To allow for cross-country comparison and data aggrega - tion, constant price data reported in World Development Indicators are rescaled to a common reference year (2005) and currency (U.S. dollars). System of National Accounts identifies whether a country uses the 1968, 1993, or 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). The 2008 SNA is an update of the 1993 SNA and retains its basic theoretical framework. SNA price valuation shows whether value added in the national accounts is reported at basic prices (B) or producer prices (P). Pro - ducer prices include taxes paid by producers and thus tend to overstate the actual value added in production. However, value added can be higher at basic prices than at producer prices in countries with high agricultural subsidies. Alternative conversion factor identifies the countries and years for which a World Bank-esti - mated conversion factor has been used in place of the official exchange rate (line rf in the International Mon - etary Fund's [IMF] International Financial Statistics ). See Sources and methods for further discussion of alterna - tive conversion factors. Purchasing power parity (PPP) survey year is the latest available survey year for the International Comparison Program's estimates of PPPs. Balance of Payments Manual in use refers to the classification system used to compile and report data on balance of payments. 6 refers to the 6th edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual (2009). External debt shows debt reporting status for 2014 data. A indicates that data are as reported, P that data are based on reported or collected information but include an element of staff estimation, and E that data are World Bank staff estimates. System of trade refers to the United Nations general trade system (G) or special trade system (S). Under the general trade sys - tem goods entering directly for domestic consumption and goods entered into customs storage are recorded as imports at arrival. Under the special trade system goods are recorded as imports when declared for domestic consumption whether at time of entry or on withdrawal from customs storage. Exports under the general system comprise outward-moving goods: (a) national goods wholly or partly produced in the country; (b) foreign goods, neither transformed nor declared for domestic consumption in the country, that move out - ward from customs storage; and (c) nationalized goods that have been declared for domestic consumption and move outward without being transformed. Under the special system of trade, exports are categories a and c. In some compilations categories b and c are classi - fied as re-exports. Direct transit trade\u2014goods entering or leaving for transport only\u2014is excluded from both import and export statistics. Government finance accounting concept is the accounting basis for report - ing central government financial data. For most coun - tries government finance data have been consolidated (C) into one set of accounts capturing all central govern - ment fiscal activities. Budgetary central government accounts (B) exclude some central government units. IMF data dissemination standard shows the coun - tries that subscribe to the IMF's Special Data Dissemi - nation Standard (SDDS) or General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). S refers to countries that subscribe to the SDDS and have posted data on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board at http://dsbb.imf.org. S+ countries must observe additional coverage, period - icity, and timeliness requirements. G refers to countries that subscribe to the GDDS. The SDDS was established for member countries that have or might seek access to international capital markets to guide them in provid - ing their economic and financial data to the public. The GDDS helps countries disseminate comprehensive, timely, accessible, and reliable economic, financial, and sociodemographic statistics. IMF member countries elect to participate in either the SDDS or the GDDS. Both standards enhance the availability of timely and comprehensive data and therefore contribute to the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies. The SDDS is also expected to improve the functioning of financial markets. Latest population census shows the most recent year in which a census was conducted and in which at least preliminary results have been released. The preliminary results from the very recent censuses could be reflected in timely revisions if basic data are available, such as population by age and sex, as well as the detailed definition of counting, coverage, and com - pleteness. Countries that hold register-based censuses produce similar census tables every 5 or 10 years. A rare case, France conducts a rolling census every year; the 1999 general population census was the last to cover the entire population simultaneously. Latest demographic, education, or health household survey indicates the household surveys used to compile the demographic, education, and health data in section 2.

Source of most recent income and expenditure data shows household sur - veys that collect income and expenditure data. Names and detailed information on household surveys can be found on the website of the International Household Survey Network (www.surveynetwork.org). Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire Surveys (CWIQ), developed by the World Bank, measure changes in key social indica - tors for different population groups\u2014specifically indica - tors of access, utilization, and satisfaction with core social and economic services. Expenditure survey/ budget surveys (ES/BS) collect detailed information on household consumption as well as on general demo - graphic, social, and economic characteristics. Inte - grated household surveys (IHS) collect detailed informa - tion on a wide variety of topics, including health, education, economic activities, housing, and utilities. Income surveys (IS) collect information on the income and wealth of households as well as various social and economic characteristics. Income tax registers (ITR) provide information on a population's income and allow - ance, such as gross income, taxable income, and taxes by socioeconomic group. Labor force surveys (LFS) col - lect information on employment, unemployment, hours of work, income, and wages. Living Standards World Development Indicators 2016 149 Economy States and markets Global links BackMeasurement Study Surveys (LSMS), developed by the World Bank, provide a comprehensive picture of house - hold welfare and the factors that affect it; they typically incorporate data collection at the individual, household, and community levels. Priority surveys (PS) are a light monitoring survey, designed by the World Bank, that collect data from a large number of households cost- effectively and quickly. 1-2-3 (1-2-3) surveys are imple - mented in three phases and collect socio demographic and employment data, data on the informal sector, and information on living conditions and household con - sumption. Vital registration complete identifies coun - tries that report at least 90 percent complete registries of vital (birth and death) statistics to the United Nations Statistics Division and are reported in its Population and Vital Statistics Reports. Countries with complete vital statistics registries may have more accurate and more timely demographic indicators than other countries. Latest agricultural census shows the most recent year in which an agricultural census was conducted or planned to be conducted, as reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Latest industrial data show the most recent year for which manufacturing value added data at the three-digit level of the International Standard Industrial Classification (revision 2 or 3) are available in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization database. Lat - est trade data show the most recent year for which structure of merchandise trade data from the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity Trade (Com - trade) database are available. Latest water with - drawal data show the most recent year for which data on freshwater withdrawals have been compiled from a variety of sources. Exceptional reporting periods In most economies the fiscal year is concurrent with the calendar year. Exceptions are shown in the table at right. The ending date reported here is for the fiscal year of the central government. Fiscal years for other levels of government and reporting years for statisti - cal surveys may differ. The reporting period for national accounts data is designated as either calendar year basis (CY) or fiscal year basis (FY). Most economies report their national accounts and balance of payments data using calen - dar years, but some use fiscal years. In World Devel - opment Indicators fiscal year data are assigned to the calendar year that contains the larger share of the fiscal year. If a country's fiscal year ends before June 30, data are shown in the first year of the fiscal period; if the fiscal year ends on or after June 30, data are shown in the second year of the period. Balance of payments data are reported in World Development Indicators by calendar year. Revisions to national accounts data National accounts data are revised by national statisti - cal offices when methodologies change or data sources improve. National accounts data in World Development Indicators are also revised when data sources change. The following notes, while not comprehensive, provide information on revisions from previous data.

The 214 economies included in these classifi - cations are shown on the flaps on the front and back covers of the book. Aggregates also contain data for Taiwan, China. Beginning with this edition, regional aggregates include data for economies at all income levels, unless otherwise noted. Because of missing data, aggregates for groups of economies should be treated as approximations of unknown totals or average values. The aggregation rules are intended to yield estimates for a consistent set of economies from one period to the next and for all indicators. Small differences between sums of sub - group aggregates and overall totals and averages may occur because of the approximations used. In addi - tion, compilation errors and data reporting practices may cause discrepancies in theoretically identical aggregates such as world exports and world imports. Five methods of aggregation are used in World Development Indicators: For group and world totals denoted in the tables by a t, missing data are imputed based on the relation - ship of the sum of available data to the total in the year of the previous estimate. The imputation pro - cess works forward and backward from 2005. Miss - ing values in 2005 are imputed using one of several proxy variables for which complete data are available in that year. The imputed value is calculated so that it (or its proxy) bears the same relationship to the total of available data. Imputed values are usually not calculated if missing data account for more than a third of the total in the benchmark year. The variables used as proxies are GNI in U.S. dollars; total popula - tion; exports and imports of goods and services in U.S. dollars; and value added in agriculture, industry, manufacturing, and services in U.S. dollars. Aggregates marked by an s are sums of available data. Missing values are not imputed. Sums are not computed if more than a third of the observations in the series or a proxy for the series are missing in a given year. Aggregates of ratios are denoted by a w when calcu - lated as weighted averages of the ratios (using the value of the denominator or, in some cases, another indicator as a weight) and denoted by a u when calculated as unweighted averages. The aggregate ratios are based on available data. Missing values are assumed to have the same average value as the available data. No aggregate is calculated if missing data account for more than a third of the value of weights in the benchmark year. In a few cases the aggregate ratio may be computed as the ratio of group totals after imputing values for missing data according to the above rules for computing totals. Aggregate growth rates are denoted by a w when calculated as a weighted average of growth rates. In a few cases growth rates may be computed from time series of group totals. Growth rates are not calculated if more than half the observations in a period are missing. For further discussion of meth - ods of computing growth rates see below. Aggregates denoted by an m are medians of the values shown in the table. No value is shown if more than half the observations for countries with a population of more than 1 million are missing. Exceptions to the rules may occur. Depending on the judgment of World Bank analysts, the aggregates may be based on as little as 50 percent of the avail - able data. In other cases, where missing or excluded values are judged to be small or irrelevant, aggregates are based only on the data shown in the tables. Growth rates Growth rates are calculated as annual averages and represented as percentages. Except where noted, growth rates of values are in real terms computed from constant price series. Three principal methods are used to calculate growth rates: least squares, exponential endpoint, and geometric endpoint. Rates of change from one period to the next are calculated as proportional changes from the earlier period. Least squares growth rate. Least squares growth rates are used wherever there is a sufficiently long time series to permit a reliable calculation. No growth World Development Indicators 2016 151 Economy States and markets Global links Backrate is calculated if more than half the observations in a period are missing. The least squares growth rate, r, is estimated by fitting a linear regression trend line to the logarithmic annual values of the variable in the relevant period. The regression equation takes the form ln Xt = a + bt which is the logarithmic transformation of the com - pound growth equation, Xt = Xo (1 + r )t. In this equation X is the variable, t is time, and a = ln Xo and b = ln (1 + r) are parameters to be estimated. If b * is the least squares estimate of b, then the average annual growth rate, r, is obtained as [exp( b*) - 1] and is multiplied by 100 for expres - sion as a percentage. The calculated growth rate is an average rate that is representative of the avail - able observations over the entire period. It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate between any two periods. Exponential growth rate. The growth rate between two points in time for certain demographic indicators, notably labor force and population, is calculated from the equation r = ln( pn/p0)/n where pn and p0 are the last and first observations in the period, n is the number of years in the period, and ln is the natural logarithm operator. This growth rate is based on a model of continuous, exponential growth between two points in time. It does not take into account the intermediate values of the series. Nor does it correspond to the annual rate of change measured at a one-year interval, which is given by (pn - pn-1)/pn-1. Geometric growth rate. The geometric growth rate is applicable to compound growth over discrete periods, such as the payment and reinvestment of interest or dividends. Although continuous growth, as modeled by the exponential growth rate, may be more realistic, most economic phenomena are measured only at intervals, in which case the compound growth model is appropriate. The average growth rate over n periods is calculated as r = exp[ln( p n/p0)/n] - 1. World Bank Atlas methodIn calculating GNI and GNI per capita in U.S. dollars for certain operational and analytical purposes, the World Bank uses the Atlas conversion factor instead of simple exchange rates. The purpose of the Atlas conversion factor is to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national incomes. The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the aver - age of a country's exchange rate (or alternative conver - sion factor) for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, adjusted for the difference between the rate of inflation in the country and the rate of international inflation. The objective of the adjustment is to reduce any changes to the exchange rate caused by inflation. A country's inflation rate between year t and year t-n (r t-n) is measured by the change in its GDP defla - tor (pt): pt rt-n = pt-n International inflation between year t and year t-n (rt-nSDR$) is measured using the change in a deflator based on the International Monetary Fund's unit of account, special drawing rights (or SDRs). Known as the \"SDR deflator,\" it is a weighted average of the GDP deflators (in SDR terms) of Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the euro area, converted to U.S. dollar terms; weights are the amount of each currency in one SDR unit. ptSDR$ rt-nSDR$ = pt-nSDR$152 World Development Indicators 2016 Front User guide World view People Environment ?The Atlas conversion factor (local currency to the U.S. dollar) for year t ( etatlas) is given by: where et is the average annual exchange rate (local currency to the U.S. dollar) for year t. GNI in U.S. dollars ( Atlas method) for year t (Ytatlas$) is calculated by applying the Atlas conversion factor to a country's GNI in current prices (local currency) (Yt) as follows: Ytatlas$ = Yt/etatlas The resulting Atlas GNI in U.S. dollars can then be divided by a country's midyear population to yield its GNI per capita ( Atlas method).Alternative conversion factorsThe World Bank systematically assesses the appro - priateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is deemed to be unreliable or unrepresentative of the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. This applies to only a small num - ber of countries. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conver - sion factors.Sources and methodsWorld Development Indicators 2016 153 Economy States and markets Global links Back1.
