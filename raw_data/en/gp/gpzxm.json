The key ingredients to an anticancer lifestyle, according to Dr. Servan -Schreiber, are healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management practice, and avoidance of toxins. We're pleased to present the Pittsburgh premiere of the movie, the C-Word. This is a documentary about David Servan - Schreiber's life and work in the area of cancer care. We hear in David's own words how lifestyle changes impacted on his life and the stories told help us to realize that the same approaches can help anyone. Morgan Freeman is the executive producer and narrator and his influence helps David's teachings come alive. Meghan O'Hara is the director and appears in the film, discussing her own experiences with cancer. Putting the film together was a labor of love for David's cousin and producer, Pascaline Servan -Schreiber, who will be speaking at this event. As a tribute to David, this film carries forward the message that we can all make changes that enhance our life and increase resilience when we face health challenges. While the recipe for healthy lifestyle is not new, the evidence presented is compelling and leaves the viewer empowered to make important changes. Inspired by Michael Pollan's food rules, following are David Servan - Schreiber's 20 Anticancer Rules , listing things that every person can do to avoid cancer or slow it down if they have it. David Servan -Schreiber was cofounder and the former Medical Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at UPMC Shadyside. Early in his promising career, when a research subject didn't show up for a study on the effect of emotion on brain imaging, David volunteered, going into the scanner. This led to the discovery of a malignant brain tumor at age 31 and was the start of a 20 -year struggle with cancer. His life's work can be viewed as chapters in a book. Early in his career, he worked internationally with refugees, helping found the U.S. branch of Doctors Without Borders. He started his formal career as a pioneer in cognitive neuroscience. His next opus was advancing the mission of the Center for Integrative Medicine and developing an approach to non -pharmacologic management of depression and anxiety. This served as the backdrop for his next career, as a world renowned author and speaker. After \"retiring\" from clinical practice, he returned to his family home in Paris and devoted himself to writing. His first book, Instinct to Heal , described the methods he used to help individuals with mental health difficulties. When I was new to this field, I asked David how I can best help patients with psychiatric disorders who showed only limited response to the usual approaches. He responded, \"In all due modesty, Ron, read my book\" and his books and teachings have helped me greatly through my career. He devoted the last several years of his life to holistic cancer care. Given his personal experience he dove into this area with the same energy that he devoted to all of his other endeavors. His second book, Anticancer: A New Way of Life, has been the best - selling book about cancer in the world, with over 1 million copies in 36 languages. He describes lifestyle approaches to the Fall/Winter 2017/18 Remembering David Servan -Schreiber (1961 -2011) by Ronald Glick, MD The Center for Integrative Medicine invites you to join us for a 20th Anniversary Celebration Thursday, October 26th 2017 5:30pm - 9:00pm UPMC Shadyside - Herberman Conference Center us for a celebratory reception featuring cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and a screening of The C Word a powerful, life - altering film, narrated by Morgan Freeman, that shares the sto- ry of neuroscientist and cancer revolutionary David Servan - Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., the late Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine. $75 per person Please visit https://shadysidehospitalfoundation.org/tickets/ to register Inside CIM Newsletter David Servan -Schreiber 1-2 Research Announcements 3 Fascia, Fiunction, Movement 3 Classes & Lectures 4 1 Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S. Aiken Ave 412-623-3023 integrativemedicine.upmc.com 2 FOOD RULES 1. Go retro: Your main course should be 80 percent vegetables, 20 percent animal protein, like it was in the old days. Opt for the opposite of the quarter pounder topped with a token leaf of iceberg lettuce and an anemic tomato slice. Meat should be used sparingly for taste, as when it used to be scarce, and should not be the focus of the meal. 2. Mix and match your vegetables: Vary the vegetables you eat from one meal to the next, or mix them together -- broccoli is an effective anticancer food, and is even more effective when combined with tomato sauce, onions or garlic. Get in the habit of adding onions, garlic or leeks to all your dishes as you cook. 3. Go organic: Choose organic foods whenever possible, but remember it's always better to eat broccoli that's been exposed to pesticide than to not eat broccoli at all (the same applies to any other anticancer vegetable). 4. Spice it up: Add turmeric (with black pepper) when cooking (delicious in salad dressings!). This yellow spice is the most powerful natural anti -inflammatory agent. Remember to add Mediterranean herbs to your food: thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, marjoram, mint, etc. They don't just add flavor, they can also help reduce the growth of cancer cells. 5. Skip the potato: Potatoes raise blood sugar, which can feed inflammation and cancer growth. They also contain high levels of pesticide residue (to the point that most potato farmers I know don't eat their own grown potatoes). 6. Go fish: Eat fish two or three times a week - sardines, mackerel, and anchovies have less mercury and PCBs than bigger fish like tuna. Avoid swordfish and shark, which the FDA says pregnant women should not eat because they contain a high concentration of contaminants. 7. Remember not all eggs are created equal: Choose only omega -3 eggs, or don't eat the yolks. Hens are now fed on mostly corn and soybeans, and their eggs contain 20 times more pro - inflammatory omega -6 fatty acids than cell -growth regulating omega - 3s. 8. Change your oil: Use only olive and canola oil in cooking and salad dressings. Go through your kitchen cabinets and throw out your soybean, corn and sunflower oils. (And no, you can't give them to your neighbors or your relatives... They're much too rich in omega -6 fatty acids!) 9. Say \"Brown is beautiful\": Eat your grains whole and mixed (wheat with oats, barley, spelt, flax, etc.) and favor organic whole grains when possible since pesticides tend to accumulate on whole grains. Avoid refined, white flour (used in bagels, muffins, sandwich bread, buns, etc.) whenever possible, and eat white pasta only al dente. 10. Keep sweets down to fruits: Cut down on sugar by avoiding sweetened sodas and fruit juices, and skipping dessert or replacing it Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S. Aiken Ave 412-623-3023 integrativemedicine.upmc.com with fruit (especially stone fruits and berries) after most meals. Read the labels carefully, and steer clear of products that list any type of sugar (including brown sugar, corn syrup, etc.) in the first three ingredients. If you have an incorrigible sweet tooth, try a few squares of dark chocolate containing more than 70% cocoa. 11. Go green: Instead of coffee or black tea, drink three cups of green tea per day. Use decaffeinated green tea if it gets you too wired. Regular consumption of green tea has been linked to a significant reduction in the risk for developing cancer. 12. Make room for exceptions. What matters is what you do on a daily basis, not the occasional treat. NON -FOOD RULES 1. Get physical: Make time to exercise, be it walking, dancing or running. Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity at least 5 days a week. This can be as easy as just walking part of the way to the office, or the grocery store. A dog is often a better walking partner than an exercise buddy. Choose an activity you enjoy; if you're having fun, you're more likely to stick with it. 2. Let the sun shine in: Try to get at least 20 minutes of daily sun exposure (torso, arms and legs) without sunscreen, preferably at noon in the summer (but take care to avoid sunburns!). This will boost your body's natural production of Vitamin D. As an alternative: discuss the option of taking a Vitamin D3 supplement with your doctor. 3. Banish bad chemicals: Avoid exposure to common household contaminants. You should air out your dry -cleaning for two hours before storing or wearing it; use organic cleaning products (or wear gloves); don't heat liquids or food in hard plastics; avoid cosmetics with parabens and phthalates; don't use chemical pesticides in your house or garden; replace your scratched Teflon pans; filter your tap water (or use bottled water) if you live in a contaminated area; don't keep your cell phone close to you when it is turned on. 4. Reach out (and touch someone!): Reach out to at least two friends for support (logistical and emotional) during times of stress, even if it's through the internet. But if they're within arm's reach, go ahead and hug them, often! 5. Remember to breathe: Learn a basic breathing relaxation technique to let out some steam whenever you start to feel stressed. 6. Get involved: Find out how you can best give something back to your local community, then give it. 7. Cultivate happiness like a garden: Make sure you do one thing you love for yourself on most days (it doesn't have to take long!). References: Anticancer: A New Way of Life.

In cele- bration of our anniversary, we will be hosting educational and community events over the next six months. Without com- ing up for air, after the showing of the film the C-Word , we are pleased to feature our second event of the year. Two of the world's experts on connective tissue and movement pat- terns will be presenting a lecture and experiential program for the community. This will take place on Wednesday Nov. 1, 2017 from 6 -8 p.m. at UPMC Shadyside West Wing Audi- torium. Speakers include: David Lesondak, BCSI, FST, author of Fascia: What it is and why it matters , the newly released book that explains the importance of this connective tissue in helping our musculo- skeletal system come together, work better, and interact with the other systems of the body. PJ O'Clair, Master Instructor Trainer at Merrithew, Inc. from Canada, Senior Master Instructor -TRX, has helped create and develop fascial fitness and movement programs and teaches and lectures worldwide. There are multiple systems of caring for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, from orthopaedic surgery, to standard rehabilitation methods, to chiropractic, to massage therapy. With all of these methods of treatment, why do so many of us continue to carry stress in our bodies and experi- ence so many injuries and chronic problems that don't fully resolve. For some the missing link may lie in the connective tissue called fascia. These two experts will approach the topic from different angles. It should allow participants to come away with helpful ideas, a better understanding of their bodies, and new approaches to management of symptoms. This program is free of charge. Healthy Steps will be awarded to UPMC staff. Advance registration is requested by calling 412-623-3023. Light refreshments will be provided. Reference: Fascia: What it is and Why it Matters .
