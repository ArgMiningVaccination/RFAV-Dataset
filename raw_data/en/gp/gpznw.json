Often the symptoms people have are ready to be addressed by using a Personalized Vibrational Remedy to heal the physical cause of that issue. For some people their issues are stored in the emotional mental and spiritual levels. To heal these issues, regression and healing methods are used. The exact moment that particular issue arose in the body is determined and then released by healing that moment. Since cellular memory is stored in the muscles, the healing creates relaxation in the physical areas that the issue was stored. This method is used in a balanced way, releasing trauma gently to restore circulation and well being to those areas. Emotional Mental and Spiritual healing is sometimes needed before a physical symptom can be healed with a remedy. In this way, physical symptoms can be released from the body on a deeper, long term basis. "}
