[ASTM F1241] The Unit Cell Crystals are usually presented in terms of their unit cell. The unit cell is the smallest part of a crystal that, if repeated regularly by translation in three dimensions, creates the whole crystal. (Note: only translation of the unit cell is permitted, not inversion, rotation, or reflection.) The unit cell of a crystal is defined by the [crystal's lattice points](/definition/lattice_crystal.html). Examples of Crystals Nonmetal Elements The carbon atoms in diamond are held together in a covalent lattice by network covalent bonding. Iodine crystals are made of I2 molecules held together in a crystal lattice by van der Waals forces. These forces are weak compared with covalent bonds, leading to a low melting point for iodine. Metal Elements Solid metal crystals are held together by metallic bonding: i.e. a lattice of positively charged metal ions is held together by sharing delocalized conduction electrons. Metalloid Elements Crystalline silicon is held together in a covalent lattice by network covalent bonding. Tellurium crystals are formed from spiral chains of covalently bonded atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Ionic Compounds Ionic solid compounds are held together in a lattice by ionic bonds between anions and cations. Image by Crystal Titan. Covalent Compounds 1 The covalent solid compounds below are held together in a covalent lattice by network covalent bonding. Image by Didier Descouens. Covalent Compounds 2 The water ice crystals below are held together in a lattice by polar covalent bonds. Anisotropy Differences in crystals when viewed along different axes can lead to [anisotropy](/definition/anisotropy.html) in crystalline materials. Crystal Structure The precise lattice constructions of crystals are found using [X-ray diffraction](/definition/x_ray_diffraction_xrd.html). Non-Crystalline Solids Not all solids are crystalline. Solids also exist in amorphous and glass forms: unlike crystals, these forms have no long-range ordering in their structures. "}
