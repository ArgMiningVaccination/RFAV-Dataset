M. et al. JAMA 2007;297:403-406. Effectiveness What is Practiced -Based research? Research that occurs in the office, clinic or hospital, where patients generally receive clinical care. Method to study the interventions as they are routinely delivered clinically. Advantages? Examine whether interventions with proven efficacy are truly effective and sustainable when provided in real -world setting Captures data on representative patients who are receiving representative treatments Possible to assess utility of an intervention provided by clinicians with a broad range of training and expertise Possible to obtain clinically detailed, patient -level data Disadvantages? Limited ability to infer causality given the lack of randomization Data collection may be performed by clinicians who may lack specialized research training Electronic health record is a clinical tool and not designed for research purposes Practice Based Research: Integrative Medicine Integrative Medicine provided at Abbott Northwestern Hospital (ANW) Acute pain BraveNet Practice Based Research Network (PBRN) Chronic Pain Effectiveness of Integrative Medicine Integrative Medicine (IM) provided at Abbott Northwestern Hospital 630 bed tertiary care hospital Penny George Institute (PGI) started providing IM services in 2003 ~10,000 IM sessions annually (circa 2016) IM services are provided at no cost to patient Average 31 minutes per session 1.5 sessions per patient per hospital admission IM Care and Practitioners (circa 2016) Patients receive individualized IM care including: Acupuncture, acupressure therapeutic medical massage, reflexology mind/body therapies (e.g. relaxation response) energy healing (e.g. Reiki, healing touch) music therapy aromatherapy 15 practitioners (11.5 FTEs) 6.3 FTE massage therapists 3.5 FTE acupuncturists 0.9 FTE music therapist 0.8 FTE Nursing 17 Penny George Institute: IM Process Physician or nurse referrals via EPIC electronic health record (EHR) Acupuncture must be referred by MD Triage Meeting of IM providers EHR review by IM provider IM Treatment Session (conducted within 24- 36 hrs) Intake Baseline data collection (e.g., pain, anxiety, nausea, coping) IM therapy provided Follow -up data collection IM provider documents the baseline and follow -up results in EHR 19 EPIC -specialized flowsheet 20 EPIC -specialized flowsheet Impact of IM on Pain Management Participants: 1837 patients hospitalized between January 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009. Measurements: Pretreatment and post -treatment pain scores on a verbal numeric rating scale (0 to 10). Results: Most patients (66%) had not previously received any integrative services. The average reduction in pain was 1.9 points and the average percentage in pain reduction was 55%. No differences across clinical populations ( due to small sample size ).

Is the 1.9 unit decrease reproducible ? Which patients receive IM? Does pain relief differ by IM therapy? Does pain relief differ by clinical population? Might specific therapies effect greater pain relief in certain clinical populations? Is IM cost effective in pain population? What is the duration of pain relief?

Longer -term pain relief is exhibited across clinical populations. Reduce hospital costs for pain inpatients responding to IM. Are well liked by providers and patients (Emergency department) with potential impact on pain intensity . Future studies are warranted and could explore: Multi- site, feasibility of AQ in the ED is next step. Definitive study of AQ in ED is final goal. Potential synergy of opioid analgesics and IM therapy. Longer -term effects of IM on pain and anxiety. Optimal cost effectiveness delivery of IM therapy for inpatients and ED.
