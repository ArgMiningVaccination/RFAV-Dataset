Are you sick today? Persons with an acute febrile illness with moderate to severe symptoms, such as upper respiratory illness, sore th roat, or malaise should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have improved. A mild illness such as, cold, does not contra indicate administration of the h epatitis A vaccine. There is no evidence that a mild illness with or without a fever reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. Note: Having a chronic disease is not a contraindication to receiving a hepatitis A vaccine. In fact, the vaccine is recommended for p eople with chronic liver disease who may have more severe illness if they do become i nfected with hepatitis A virus. 2. Do you have allerg ies to any medication or latex? A history of anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine components is a contraindication to getting hepatitis A vaccine . An anaphylactic reaction to latex is a contraindication to vaccines that contain latex as a component or as part of the packaging (e.g., vial stoppers, prefilled syringe plungers, prefilled syringe caps). and Twinrix prefilled syringes contain natural rubber latex . The vial stopper, syringe plunger, and tip caps of Vaqta contain latex. A local reaction to a prior vaccine dose or vaccine component, including latex, is not a contraindication to a subsequent dose or vaccine containing that component. 3. Have you ever had a serious reaction after receiving a vaccination? Histor y of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses.
