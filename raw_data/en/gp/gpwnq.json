Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 FORWARD On behalf of the governing body of 'TOP India T rust' I have great pleasure in presenting you a comprehensive report of our activities during the period April 2006 to March 2007. The theme of our activity is 'prevent torture,resist torture and help victims of torture'. All our project activities are developed based on the definition of torture by United Nations. Infliction of severe and excruciating physical pain is unbearable for any human being. When threat and intimidation is combined with the infliction of physical pain in a systematic method the individual breaks down. So also, if the physical pain is mild or moderate but if it is a continuous process withdifferent types of humiliations and harassment there is no doubt, the individual will breakdown. These are some of the types and methods torture which is happening in India. T orture is found to be the main tool ofoperations of the law enforcing agencies in India to prove offences and collect evidences. Our work is centered around in identifying the victim of torture and extending them medical treatment and provide medicaltestimonial before the judiciary for the purpose of rehabilitation and reparation. During the reporting period we had two projects 1. Care T reatment and Rehabilitation of T orture Victims in Kerala State (Direct Assistance 06-07) 2. T raining of Medical Professionals of the State (TMP 06-07) Even though India has constitutional remedies & multiple legislations to prevent torture and impunity still the prevalence of torture is high, butunder reported. During 2006-2007 we had registered 111 cases of torture in Kerala State. T o identify the torture victims and to make perfect professional documentation with medical evidences, we realized that alongwith the fact findings, co-operation and involvement of medical professionals is also essential. In this background, along with the care treatment and rehabilitation, we initiated a general training programme on 'torturemedicine' for the doctors of the state.In the curriculum of medical profession, torture is not included as a specialized subject. So also in the present system of medical documentation we sense that there are multiple inadequacies in the examination,investigation, documentation and confirmation of the diagnosis of 'torturevictim'. In order to make an impact and initiate a change, we joined withIndian Medical Association, Kerala State Branch, Kerala Government MedicalOfficers Association and Qualified Medical Practitioners Association toimpart training for the doctors of the state. We were able to train 41persons to act as State level Resource Persons for further on going trainingfor the medical professionals and 20 specialized senior doctors to act asspecialist consultants to examine torture victims. We could get theconcurrence and approval of Ministry of Health, Kerala State andDepartment of Health Services for this training programme. We expect tocomplete the training programme by June, 2009. Regarding the ratification of the Convention Against T orture (CAT 1984), we have been sensing the negative impact of non-ratification of theconvention by the Government of India. Inspite of strong recommendationsfrom National Human Rights Commission Government of India has initiatedsome basic works to ratify the convention. In order to pressurize theGovernment of India, in the process of ratification we formed a delegationof NGOs from the different parts of the country working against tortureto meet the Prime Minister of India. On 4th December 2006 the delegationmet the Prime Minister and presented a formal appeal to ratify theconvention against torture and make appropriate domestic regulations toprotect the common man from the torture. We anticipate the Governmentof India will act on our appeal and ratify the convention before 2008. Our activities are highlighted in the following chapters. We invite your comments, criticisms and suggestions about our work. All communicationin this regard will be considered with positive spirit and I assure you thatour team will work hard to improve the situation in India and strengthenour democracy. Dr. S.D.

Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 GENESIS AND GROWTH OF TOP INDIA TRUST During 1993-94, the National Head quarters of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) collaborating with the International Rehabilitation Council for T orture Victims (IRCT), based in Copenhagen, Denmark, published aquestionnaire in the national journal of IMA to assess the knowledge of Indian doctors regarding 'T orture Medicine'. The assessment proved that the doctors of India are in need of more information, training and knowledge.As a result, the IMA together with the support and help of IRCT organised a two weeks training programme in Delhi for Indian doctors in 1995. Our founder secretary and director, Dr. S.D. Singh was one among the fiftydoctors who were trained in the first batch of Indian doctors on 'T ortureMedicine'. In 1998, as a continuation to the above mentioned initiative and also in order to respond to the needs of the society, certain eminent people ofCochin put in their efforts to form a charitable trust with the sole objectiveof fighting against torture and Human Rights violations. The foundermembers of the T rust are Justice V .R. Krishan Iyer, Former Judge, Supremecourt of India (Patron), Dr. Sebastian Paul, a legal luminary andparliamentarian (Chairperson), Dr. Jacob Thomas, a senior official of theIndian Police Service (Managing T rustee), Dr. S.D. Singh, a senior stalwartin the field of Indian Psychiatry (Secretary), Smt. Leela Menon, well knownwriter and Menon, a well socialworker and activist (T rustee) and Sri. Arun Kumar, a senior journalist (T rustee). Their hard work and commitment led to the genesis of a charitabletrust called 'T orture Prevention Center India T rust' (Register Number 478/98, registered on 11 October, 1998), popularly known by its acronym 'TOP India T rust'.Later, the Board of T rustees of TOP India T rust felt the need of more resource persons to guide the activities. As per the unanimous decision of the Board, we invited Dr. Balaraman (Former Acting Chairperson of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission), Mr. R.V . Pillai IAS (Member, UN committee on Racial Discrimination), Mr. T .N. Jayachandran IAS (Former additional Chief Secretary to Govt. of Kerala), Smt. Sugatha Kumari (Social activist and poetess), Dr. P .V . George (Former National President, Indian Medical Association), to join the activities of T op India T rust in the capacity of advisory board members. On their accepting the invitation, the advisory board started functioning from September 2004. During the initial stages, board of trustees and members of the advisory board generously contributed for the day-to-day functioning of the trust and also to carry out minimum activities. International Rehabilitation Council for T orture Victims (IRCT) extended its full support and continued to associate with us and encouraged the T rust to initiate an active project. It was in 2001, that the T rust decided to apply for funding support from different international agencies and with the guidance from the IRCT liaison office in Brussels the trust could submit a project proposal to the European Commission. The European Commission accepted this proposal and with this initial funding support, the T rust could initiate its first major project. The project period was from 1st May 2002 to March 2005 and theme adopted was 'Prevent T orture, Resist T orture and Help victims of T orture'. All the activities were designed and structured based on this theme. This project was the first of its kind in the state of Kerala. The three major target groups of the project were the law enforcing officials, the victims of torture and the population of the state in general (33 million). We could help 409 victims of torture during the first project. Later during 2005 and 2006 we continued our activities under the same theme with the funding support from UNVFT , OAK grant and local donors. As of today we have 3 4Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 treated and rehabilitated 630 victims of torture and interacted with over 0.25 million people of Kerala through our regular interaction programmes In 2006 together with the Indian Medical Association, the Kerala Government Medical Officers Association and the Qualified Private Medical Practitioners Association we initiated a training programme for the medical professionals of Kerala with the funding support from UNVFT . We havetrained 41 State Level Resource Persons (SLRP) to act as master trainers for training the remaining 20000 doctors of Kerala. We expect to complete the training of doctors by June 2009. During 2007 as part of the activities of the project with European Commission we initiated the work to develop District Core Groups (DCG) in each of the 14 districts of Kerala. Each DCG consists of 3 doctors, 3lawyers, 3 NGO representatives and 10 volunteers. The members of the DCG will be given specialized training on the topic 'How to act in the event of torture'. The DCGs would be performing the functions: 1. Be on a vigilant watch in the district 2. Reach the victim immediately in the event of torture. 3. Organize immediate medical care to the victim 4. Provide urgent assistance to the victims and their family members. 5. Give counselling and legal guidance to the victims and family members. 6. Draft the legal petition to be submitted to the higher authorities.7. Follow up the victims till he /she is rehabilitated back to the society. Summarising our activities over the past nine years one realises that the T rust has indeed grown from a mere notion to an active force. We hope to continue our activities in the future on a much larger scale and to extend a helping hand to the torture victims in our state.PAST PROJECTS Our activities from 1998 till today can be summarized under the following heads: 1. Initial stage (1998 to 2002): We initiated our activities in a simple low profile manner. Later the International Rehabilitation Council for T orture victims (IRCT) inDenmark provided training and helped us initiate a center. Along with the IRCT many local organizations and professionals supported us in the primary stages. 2. First major project (2002 to 2005): We are thankful to IRCT for the excellent professional training they imparted in order to treat and rehabilitate torture victims, and alsoin building positive relations with many international organizations, funding agencies and dignitaries. In 2001, IRCT helped us to submit an application to the European Commission for funding support. Cochin Mental Health Center, Darshn, Yuvaparivarthan and Jawahar Social Welfare Center, which are well known NGOs of the state, also came forward with their support and they joined us as partnersin the activities. T o our satisfaction and pleasure the application to the EC turned out to be successful and on 24th April 2002 we signed the agreement with European Commission for our first major project B7-701/2001-2055 .The duration of the project was 36 months.

Year 2006 - 2007 PROJECTS (2006-2007) During 2006 we were actively continuing the care, treatment and rehabilitation (CTR-2) of the victims of torture. Up to June 2006 we had atotal registration of 519. Out of this most of the victims are fully rehabilitated back to the society.

The NGOs of the state and major medical organizations helped us to implement the project successfully. 2. T raining of Medical professionals of Kerala We are aware that along with the treatment, the testimonial from the medical professionals is very essential for the torture victim to present before the authorities for claiming their compensation andalso to seek justice from the authority. We realized that the medical professionals of our state need more advanced knowledge and training on 'T orture Medicine'. Thus, as per our invitation, the IndianMedical Association Kerala State Branch, the Kerala Government Medical officers Association and the Qualified Private Medical Practitioners Association, have joined us to train the medicalprofessionals of Kerala. The training is being organized in multiple phases and will be completed only by June 2009.

One senior Counselor was designated to be in charge of the Department. This person in charge of the department helps the counselors and other volunteer staff to identify the torturevictims. Once we have identified a case / or a group of cases as suspected torture victims, as a routine we carry out all possible medical investigations to confirm physical / psychological findings inthe individual. The trained doctors support and help us to confirm the diagnosis and plan the course of the treatment. In the treatment programmes all cases are routinely screened by mental healthprofessionals to rule out/confirm the psychological impact of torture. In the care treatment and rehabilitation programme we extend a balanced combination of physical, psychological, social care andtreatment depending on the severity and need of the case. Counseling is an inevitable part of our programme and we have qualified and trained counselors in our team to conduct counseling for victims and their family members. In the rehabilitation programmes, along with the physical & mental care and counseling,we provide physiotherapy for victims who have sustained physical trauma. For extending inpatient care we have a panel of hospitals where we admit our victims. We have developed positiveprofessional relations and formal partnership with Indian Medical Association (IMA) Kerala State Branch, Qualified Private Medical Practitioners Association, (QPMPA) of Kerala State, KeralaGovernment Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) and many other local NGOs. This relations make our work more productive and meaningful. 3. Department of Documentation, research and analysis (Dept of DRA) The process of registration of a victim with our center is done at two levels.

Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 by the staff / volunteer to the feild. Relevant details of victims are regularly entered in this format and once they reach the officedetails are entered into the computerized detailed format. Meeting the victim (House visit cum registration form) This form contains only two pages, which has very basic socio demographic data of the alleged victim and minimum details of the event of torture and condition of the victim. The staff / volunteerwho comes in contact with the victim for the first time in the field fill up this proforma. With the preliminary data we will provisionally register the case as a torture victim. Full computerized case sheet This is a special software designated as 'TOPPro' which was developed by our center during 2006.Since 2006 April all details are entered in this computerized format. T o fill up and work with the software the staff has to be trained. For training the staff we havespecial induction module which used as a standard system to train the new staff.

As an outcome of this activity few of our registered victims fully rehabilitated is acting as our councillorsin the field. 5.

Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 RCT Mission Report Visit to The T orture Prevention Centre (TOP) 7-9 September, 2006 Jan Ole Haagensen, Ph.D. Director, International Department, RCT Inger Agger, Ph.D. Senior Erik Wendt, Program manager for Asia, RCT January 20071. Introduction This report is based on a visit by an RCT mission to the T orture Prevention Centre (TOP) on September 7-9 2006. The reportreflects the immediate impressions and views of the mission gainedthrough this visit and through the materials received. Thus, it doesnot as such represent a full scale evaluation of the organisation, but rather preliminary observations. The mission would like to extent it's heartfelt thanks to Dr. Singh and the staff of TOP for making thevisit a very positive experience. It is hoped this brief report may beuseful to the organisation. The T eam received an overview of the TOP organisation, its historic formation of the T rust and the most recent developments. The T op-India T rust was formed in 1998 with a special focus on treating and preventing torture in Kerala State. As stated in TOP's presentation brochure, the main objective of the organisation is to: \" Prevent torture, resist torture and help victims of torture \". 2. Organisation In general TOP Board Members are all high profile and busy people. The managing trustee of TOP , Dr. Thomas, is an Inspector GeneralPolice. A member of the Board is a former chairperson of the national human rights commission. The organisation has many supporters from the higher strata of the public administration (either acting or retired). 33 34Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 The staffs consist of 14 mostly part-time employees: 3 medical doctors, 4 counsellors/social workers, 1 legal consultant, 1 psychologist, 1 nurse, and 4 administrative staff. TOP is also using a panel of doctors and legal advisors to assist its efforts to rehabilitatethe victims. TOP has some challenges to overcome for the future development of the organisation. Permanent staffs have been reduced and the organisation has been slimmed; networking has not been as effective as one could wish; IT infrastructure needs upgrading; equipmentneeds to be updated; funding is irregular; there is a need to engage in a national coalition of Indian centres; and TOP has not issued any regular populations in the past. 3. Funding situation TOP was in a difficult financial situation at time of visit, and activitieswere reduced due to lack of funding. TOP Centre faced a dramaticreduction in its core funding after three years of program expansion with an EU grant of 408.000 Euro. The finalisation of the project ultimo 2005 led to a scaling back of activities and staff reductionfrom 22 to 6 permanent staff members. TOP Centre procured with the EU funding a spacious office building located in a quiet neighbourhood. At the time of the RCT mission visit the activitieswere reduced due to lack of funding. Funding for year 2006/07 activities related to care and treatment as well as training for medical professionals has been obtained from the UNVFVT , OAK foundation and some local donations. TOP hastrained 48 state level and 85 district level health professionals in 2006/07. TOP cooperates with the medical association of India. The T eam learned that TOP had submitted a project proposal and were short listed by the EU for a second grant to further contribute towards reduced torture in Kerala. 4. IRCT cooperation and international networking TOP centre benefits substantially from being accredited with theIRCT such as capacity building in terms of trainings, workshops and relevant professional materials. The secretary of TOP is a psychiatristand also member of the IRCT council. The participation of TOP at the regional IRCT legal workshop held in Dhaka inspired TOP to seek closer interaction with the Asian Human Rights Commissionand BRCT . 5. EU funding and future perspectives The major needs of the state health sector are linked to limited awareness and professional capacity to deal with victims of torture. A second EU project proposal would enable TOP to embark on amassive training program for gnu's, government officials, lawyers of state, medical professionals and judicial officers. The training drive would be combined with continued care of torture victims at theTOP clinic. TOP is also participant in a regional EU project proposal covering India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The TOP centre management is hopeful that the new EU application will be grantedlater this year. 35 36Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 6. Law enforcement and preventive tactics The position of TOP concerning the law enforcement agencies as well as with other stakeholder is to keep the dialogue open or \"going positively with all groups\". TOP has implemented an impressivenumber of police-public and police-student interactive confidencebuilding seminars. TOP has found that traditional classroom trainingof the police force is inefficient whereas to facilitate dialogue meetingsbetween general public and police are more useful. TOP has repeatedly joined other calls for the ratification of the CAT . Many other human rights organisations such as the HumanRights Lawyers Network are active in the legal field of prevention of torture. TOP would like see a better coordinated NGO sector as a mean to build a movement against torture in India. Accordingto TOP there may be several thousand human rights organisations only in the state of Kerala. T orture complaints can be forwarded to the Human Rights Commission; directly to the police superintendent and/or a complaint may be raised as a private litigation in court. The Human Rights Commission in Kerala State is widely criticized for beingineffective and without executive powers. Restructuring of the HRCT is being discussed. TOP in joint action with the other IRCT registered centres are planning to appeal directly to the PrimeMinister for action to improve the situation.7. Psychosocial Interventions Beneficiaries are mostly \"referred\" to TOP through the media, i.e., when a person has been tortured by the police the pressusually carry the story and in this way TOP finds their beneficiaries, which are frequently hospitalised due to the torture. Often TOP meets a group of other human rights NGOs when they arrive atthe hospital bed of the victim and sometimes has problems reaching the victim \"through this crowd\" and providing their medical and psychosocial assistance. Other victims are referred by human rightsNGOs. 7.1 Beneficiaries The main beneficiary category consists of victims of police torture. From April 2005 - March 2006, TOP provided assistance to 85victims, all adults of which about 85% were male and 15% female.About half of them had been exposed both to physical andpsychological torture, and about 35% only to psychological torture.According to 2003-2005 statistics TOP were able to treat a total of409 victims of torture and they report that 302 victims were 'fullyrehabilitated'. 79% of the perpetrators were police officials, while the remaining perpetrators were prison or forest officials, elected representativesor other government officials. The purpose of the torture was definedby TOP as \"abuse of power and authority (most cases), revenge,confession or punishment\". 37 38Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 The victims were provided with hospitalisation, medical investigation, medical treatment, counselling, legal guidance, andreporting to authorities. 7.2 Psychosocial Activities TOP divides their psychosocial activities into: psychological counselling, medical treatment, legal counselling, group counselling and supporting victims associations. The 85 victims treated last year were provided with a total number of 379 counselling (psychological, legal or group) sessions, which means that each victim on an average received 4.5 sessions. Half ofall sessions took place at TOP's centre while the remaining sessions were provided at hospital or home, or in a detention centre. The counselling activities are mostly \"Western\" or \"modern\" consisting in sympathetic and empathic listening and down-to-earth advice. Victims are encouraged to practise meditation or consultayurvedic medicine, or - if they believe in other traditional approaches - they are encouraged to use these channels for psychosocial support. During the psychological counselling sessions the victim tells his/her story, and expresses the feelings coming up. The counsellor analyses the story and the feelings of the victim, naturalises the reactions, and goes into the shame and guilt attempting to release the victimfrom these feelings. An important part of the counselling is also to try to get justice for the victim and to help give him/her some training, for example in tailoring and handicrafts.During the next year, TOP also plans to train medical staff (if awarded funding). 7.3 Research TOP has not been able to initiate research or studies in the past, due to lack of funding, however they have found a need for studies within the following areas: a) analytical works to understand culture bound generics of torture; b) lawful tactical method to preventtorture; c) culture bound special medical psychiatric symptoms of TOV and their treatment; d) newer counselling techniques; and e) systematic documentation. 7.4 Monitoring and EvaluationTOP maintains an impressive recording system and presented statistics on methods of torture; perpetrator; gender and age composition and so forth. TOP is presently developing a databasefor reporting about the torture, which their beneficiaries have been submitted to. TOP also keeps fundamental statistics of its activities, but does not have any M&E system in place for the monitoring ofthe outcome of activities. Presently, TOP is using a modified version of the Quality of Life 5 as a self reporting tool to measure effect of psychosocial interventions: I am stable now, I feel well, and alsolooks at social parameters such as employment: is s/he back to society, back to work. 39 40Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 7.5 Gender Aspects The organisation is not particularly focused on gender aspects, but does give special attention to female torture victims who have beensubmitted to police brutality and \"kicked in areas that you don't show\". The doctor and the female counsellor examine the woman to find out how deeply hurt she is and they then provide her with counselling assistance for 1-2 hours 4-5 times in her home. Most women are not willing to come to TOP's centre due to the stigma and shame associated with the torture. 8. Perspectives for RCT RCT policy targets are based upon knowledge generation and applied research in the field of rehabilitation and prevention of torture. There does not seem to be any apparent new knowledge perspectives in collaborating with TOP at the moment. Although limited time was available for the dialogue with TOP it should be mentioned that the T eam was impressed with a number of important issues: - TOP has demonstrated its ability to come through with their EU application and they have been able to handle a major grant from the EU. This proves a certain level of organisational skills and maturity. - TOP as an organisation is fortunate to benefit from the energy and hard work of Dr. Singh to manage its program. TOP benefits also from Dr. Singh as he is member of the IRCT council. This proves in itself his qualifications as an international leader and policy maker.- Equally impressive is the fact that TOP has been able to pass to the second round of the present EU calls for proposals. The RCT would like to applaud TOP for this achievement andwould hope that TOP will succeed in the next round. - TOP is fortunate to have a panel of resourceful people in its advisory committee including high ranking police officers - TOP is taking a clear stand against torture using a non- confrontational approach to law enforcement. The dialoguemeetings are interesting examples of building trust and better understanding between police and common people - TOP is taking many initiatives such as setting up Victims Associations and they are quick to use tactical inspiration from other anti torture organisations such as the Asian Human Rights Commission and from BRCT in Bangladesh. 41 42Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust).

Year 2006 - 2007 PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION REASONS FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION lT orture may cause symptoms that are considerable, lasting, and affect the working capacity and social life of the survivor. lT orture methods mostly do not leave any physical evidence or overthe course of time existing findings can disappear. Some physical findings may not enable a torture diagnosis. lPsychiatric evaluation is also one of the most important consultationsto decide the need of treatment. INTERVIEW PROCESS The clinician should introduce the interview process in a manner that explains in detail the procedures to be followed. The clinician should be prepared for explosive personal reactions as a consequence of various questions. The patient may feel insecure and frightened. The individual needs to be given an opportunity to request break, interrupt or postpone the interview. Strong negative feelings towards the clinician may develop. The clinician should allow for the expression and explanation of such feelings and express understanding for the individual's various predicaments. The clinician thus should endeavor to prevent these negative feelings from degrading the interview. FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS OF PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION document torture and other traumatic experiences. Record complaints(Appendix 1)A detailed record of personal experience considering torture and other mental traumas or other problems. (Appendix 2)document other complaints and record the experience in relation to any mental disorders and medical diseases. History of drug abuse and addictions if any.History of mental disorders and the overall picture of medical/psychiatric condition of family Mental condition should be evaluated.Psychological tests, checklists, questionnaires and advanced examination methods should be used in order to evaluate mental condition. Recommendations for treatment and the importance of treatment should be defined.Appendix 1. EXAMINATION OF FREQUENTLY MET SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS AFTER PSYCHOLOGICALTRAUMA Brief overview of the symptoms of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) The following questions might be used to specify individual's mental condition. While evaluating symptoms, the extent of damage and itseffects on the business life, family life, and his/her relationships with otherpeople should also be determined.\u00b7 l Do you experience fear or anxiety due to thoughts, emotions, nightmares, places, and persons that remind you of the torture experience?\u00b7 l Do you make an effort not to think about these events, and to avoid objects that remind you of them?\u00b7 l Do you feel alert constantly?\u00b7 l Do you feel after the incidences as if you are emotionally numb, and remote from intimate relationships? Examination of other possible post-trauma symptoms These initial questions will be useful in the interview process. Subsequent to these questions, if the existence of various problems are stillsuspected, the following symptoms should be searched. Reexperiencing traumatic events.Failure to behave in pre-traumatic manner as a consequence of the fear of reexperiencing trauma. Difficulty in memory and concentration.Extreme physiological reactions to flashbacks, such as palpitation, sweating, and distress. Feelings of guilt, unhedony, hopelessness, pessimism.Suicidal thoughts. 45 46Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION Appendix2 . INVESTIGATION OF CRUCIAL EVENTS AND FACTORS IN PRE - AND POST-TRAUMA PERIODS In one sense, the aims of the evaluation are to forecast possible problems and to determine risk factors. Thus, investigation of trauma-related factors is a crucial part of the evaluation. Information obtained will enable us to identify individuals who are most likely to have been exposed to psychiatric problems. Pre-traumatic factors: Demographical factors, history of mental disease, family history of mental illness, and other traumatic events, such as divorce, unemployment, legal problems, natural disasters, accidents, fire, flood, physical or sexual attack. Post-traumatic factors: These should be evaluated taking into account factors such as: basic needs, initial stress level, stressful course of life, loss of material and mental resources (how s/he copes with these problems), social support. EVALUATION GUIDE T o learn about trauma experience Brief screening for Post-trauma symptoms Re-experiencing traumaAvoidance and emotional numbness Hyperarousal Searching for other possible post-trauma symptoms Explore for pre-trauma details, trauma, and post-trauma experience, anddetermination of risk factors In the first step of the evaluation open-ended questions may be used. If needed, directquestions may be helpful Characteristics of each symptom should also be examined, as well as the extent of discomfort,duration, functionality, and the extent of effects on daily life. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The first step is to undress the patient. Clothes that are not removed and unexamined parts of the body should be recorded accompanied with definitive reasons. The individual should be informed of the importance of examination and its possible findings in a clear and comprehensible manner, and her/his consent should be obtained. Lesions: Should be described by their features, size, and location Recorded on diagrams Photographed If no visible lesions are found during the examination, this should also be recorded. The following features of the individual should be recorded:Mobilization Expression Self sanitationNutritional condition Symptoms of suffering Visible lesions or injuryPresence of eye contact Speech and language use Involuntary movements, sweating, shakingLevel of consciousness, orientation, memory Emotional reactions: Avoidance, numbness, nervousness, fear, shame,guilt, panic, anxiety, lack of self-confidenceThe following symptoms should berecorded: Pain; difficulty in walking; tendon,joint, and muscle injuries; muscle atrophy; fractures and dislocations with or without deformity;Mobility of joints, spine, and limbs Contractures, stiffness, compartment syndrome. Injuries should be described by their location, symmetry, shape, size, colour, level from surface, demarcation. Abrasions, contusions, lacerations, petechiae, swellings stab wounds, Burns with cigarette or heated instruments, Electric injuries, skin diseases, hypo / hyper pigmented areas, atrophy, alopecia, nail removal, bite headache, congestion of face, of galea aponeurotica, dislocation, subhyeloid haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage and visual field loss. Oral cavity and teeth injury, tooth avulsions (fractures of the teeth, dislocated fillings and broken prostheses), Injury to the ears (eardrum perforation, bleeding, loss of auditory functions) Nose injuries (bleeding, septal deviation, fracture), Chin injuries, (Mandibular fractures or dislocations, temporomandibular joint syndrome), fractures of the hyoid bone or laryngeal cartilage should also be searched.Special attention should be paid as to whether there is a linear zone extending circularly around the arm or leg usually at the wrist or ankle. This zone contains few hair and small hair follicles, and this is probably a form of cicatricial alopecia.Special attention should be paid to damage, contusion, subdural haematoma, cerebral oedema,failure of orientation, changes in mental condition.Acute and chronic problems in the respiratory system, rib fractures,subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax,hemothorax, injuries to heart and lungs, fractures of thevertebral pedicles, acute abdomen, rupture of an internalorgan, retroperitoneal and intraabdominalhaematomas, renal failure due to crush syndrome,hypertensionMUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM GENERAL OVERVIEW SKIN FACE/HEAD CHEST AND ABDOMEN 47 48Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust).

Singh, Ms. Malini Menon, Mr. Jayjit singh GangulyReport of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 \" If the guarantee that deprivation of life and personal liberty cannot be made except in accordance with law, is to be real the enforcement of the right in every case of contraventionmust be possible in the Constitutional Schemes, the mode of redress being that which is appropriate in the facts of each case....\" Respected Shri Manmohan Singh, The Hon'ble Supreme Court has thus regarded the sanctity of the \"Right to Life\" enshrined in the Indian Constitution in Article 21 which has even been interpreted to include the right to live with human dignity. The occurrences of torture, custodial violence, degrading and inhuman punishment, and the cruel treatment of detainees are not stray incidents in India, and we have been accused of condoning impunity in this regard.Policing in the entire subcontinent mostly depends on exertion of excessive force upon the detainee to get confession or to break the detainee. Sadly, India is no exception. Using law enforcement and other security apparatusforces to weed out opposition or to strike fear in the hearts of specific target groups are common occurrences. Those below the poverty line, women, youth, indigenous and tribal peoples, ethnic minorities, displacedpersons and migrants, foreign nationals and other minorities, unfortunately, bear the brunt of this criminal onslaught in the hands of law enforcement agents of the State. National statistics and innumerable petitions broughtbefore the judiciary, the National Human Rights Commissions, the State Human Rights Commissions where they have been instituted, and otherstatutory Commissions for the Scheduled Cates, Scheduled T ribes, Minorities, and Women bear grim witness to this reality pervading in our country today. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had concluded that in thisenvironment impunity thrives in India. Yet the State as envisaged by the Constitution has the bounden obligation to provide to every person in its territory a life with human dignity. The State has recognised the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the citizens and non-citizen by enacting and implementing the Protection of Human Rights Act 1993. India has proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also acceded to the International Covenant on Civiland Political Rights (ICCPR) as early as in 1979. Articles 7 and 10 of the ICCPR provide that it is the State's duty to prevent torture and cruel inhuman treatment of all persons whose civil liberties are being curbed bylaw. ICCPR also provides that States shall ensure that detainees are treated with human dignity. By acceding in 1992 to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 1989, the government had already recognised its international obligation to prevent torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of all citizens below the age of 18 years in strictaccordance with law, and to prevent any assault on the child's honour and dignity (Articles 16 and 37). 59 60Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust). Cochin - 682 020. Year 2006 - 2007 In 1968, India had already ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) 1965. As a StateParty, India is obliged to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinctionas to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law,notably in the enjoyment the right to security of person and protection bythe State against violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted by governmentofficials or by any individual group or institution (Article 5b read inconjunction with Article 2). The protection of detainees and ensuring that they do not fall prey to custodial violence has thus formed part of the Indian jurisprudence as anintegral part of the \"Right to Life\" as envisaged in Article 21 of theConstitution of India. The State has thus assumed the duty to ensureredressal of each individual case of contravention of right to life enshrinedin Article 21. Since 1997, India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against T orture and Other Cruel and Degrading forms of Punishment, 1984(UNCAT). Yet, a decade after signing the Convention, India has failed toenforce the Convention. The Convention provides for accountability andreparation steps, which State is required to take to redress grievances of aperson falling prey to custodial violence including torture. Yet, India is in a peculiarly unenviable position where, legally, the heinous crime of torture is not defined in the Constitution or in any penal laws.However, our Hon'ble Supreme Court has acknowledged its wideprevalence explicitly [SHRI D.K. BASU v State of West Bengal], andconcluded that the award of monetary or pecuniary reparation for victims/ survivors of custodial violence or torture is legally established. Such a legalacknowledgement of such acts establishes custodial torture as a \"wrong\",and therefore, a crime. Nevertheless, the crime itself goes unpunished.Of the 511 sections in the Indian Penal Code (IPC), not a single provisionexists to punish a law- enforcing officer for engaging in custodial torture. As citizens of democratic India we stand today in shame as our government prescribes the reprehensible crime of torture of our children and citizensas international legal obligations but continues to condone the practicedomestically in actual fact. India is now a member of the new UN organisation, the Human Rights Council (HRC). This is indeed an extremely honourable recognition of Indiaby the international community, a recognition that comes with equally loftyresponsibility. As a member of the HRC, it has an international commitmentto abide by Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the UN General Assembly Resolution60/251 creating the Human Rights Council, which calls upon candidates tomake pledges and commitments to improve their Human rights recordand abide by the highest international standards while sitting on the body. The emergent role of India as a world leader in international governance, a champion of human rights within and outside its territories, sitting as amember of the HRC provides for us all an opportunity to ratify the UNCATand extend a standing invitation to all UN Special Procedures on humanrights. Setting a high peer standard for all Asian states and the world canonly enhance our country's profile and role, facilitate India's rising credibility, 61 62Report of Torture Prevention Center India Trust, (Top India Trust).

Year 2006 - 2007 and affirm our commitment to transparency and accountability to all Indian citizens and the world. The undersigned Non-Governmental organisations have been formed with the avowed purpose of ensuring that victims of torture and any form ofcustodial torture or violence do receive appropriate redress. We stronglybelieve that as a welfare State India, firmly founded on the principles ofdemocracy, equality and sovereignty has an obligation to ensure securityand the rule of law that is free from custodial violence and torture, andwhere a victim of such can receive adequate redress in accordance withlaw. As a premier democracy of the World, increasingly playing a renascent role of international leadership and demonstrating a firm commitment to thehuman rights and fundamental freedoms of every Indian citizen, we feelthat the time has come when India must lead by example and show theWorld Community that while a bullet begets only a bullet and violencebreeds hatred and contempt, a humanitarian approach can change eventhe hardest of the misguided multitudes. It is our ardent request to you to take necessary steps to comprehensively implement the provisions of UNCAT by: 1. Taking urgent steps, including its ratification, to make the United Nations Convention Against T orture and Other Cruel and Degradingforms of Punishment, 1984 enforceable throughout the entire territory of India. 2. Ensure Acceptance of Individual Complaints Procedure by introducing an appropriate Bill amending the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 during the winter session of Parliament in 2006. 3. Adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant for the Civil and Political Rights. 4. Review the Amnesty clauses in several Penal Statutes and form proper guidelines declaring actions, which can be held to be not\"bonafide\", or not in \"good faith\". 5. Extending a standing invitation to all UN Special Reporters. 6. Implementation, in letter and spirit, of Hon'ble Supreme Court's verdict on SHRI D.K. BASU v State of West Bengal through theappropriate criminal justice reform by issuing of appropriate notifications and promulgation of amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Penal Code.

Self Introduction When we go to strange places and meet new people and victims we have to introduce ourselves or some one else may have to introduceus to the victim and his / her family members.

This isto gain the confidence and trust of the victims and members of the society in that area. The ID card with photo also affirms your authenticity.3. Confirm the event On many occasions what we hear may be one version. It may be a true / false / exaggerated or cooked up story. This can happen in thesocial - political conditions of Kerala State. So we strongly advise our team members to enquire and understand what had really happened before they interview / examine the alleged victims. Seeking the truthhelps us to work in the correct direction and also keeps up the reputation of our organization. 4. First attend to pain Helping a victim in mental or physical pain and agony is our most important objective. Our primary aim is to alleviate the pain andagony of the individual in anguish. The work & service to the victims are initiated immediately. Any delay is considered as cruelty to the victims. 5. Collect the perfect & full address with pin Full name with initials and fathers name with correct address of the victim and first degree relatives are required for correspondenceand future visits - Staff of TOP India trust may change and new staff of the organization may require the correct full name with initials with address to extend continued support to the victims.

Land phone and mobile Numbers We may require the telephone numbers to contact the victim or his / her relative for matters related to treatment, counseling and legal support. So collect the phone numbers of all people connectedwith the victim and the event. Example : telephone number of Police station, lawyer, relative of the victim, the doctor who treated the victim. 7. Voters card ID We encourage our staff to collect the photocopy of the voters ID card of the victim. This is to impress and convince any agency ordepartment. We can present this as the proof of reliability of the identity of the victim and our work. A signature or thumb impression of the victim in the case sheet is an additional proof. 8. Address of first-degree relative We require the details of the first degree relatives of the victims. In case of emergency we may need to contact the relative. 9. Consent signed by the victim and statement of relative and the witness The victims may change their views / attitude. If the victims with draw from the allegation for their own reasons after we proceed with lodging complaints later we will be held responsible for initiatingthe action. On such occasions, to prove our role in initiating such anaction, the consent statement with name, date and signature of the victim, relative and witnesses is of significance. So get the signature of the victims, relatives and witnesses in the prescribed consentformat with dates. Always write the full name in capitals with initials. The pet names / nick names / calling names may be also written in the consent form. 10. Statement of eyewitness This is essential to prove the circumstances.

Year 2006 - 2007 requirements for us to lodge a complaint against the perpetrator So always collect these documents Just a copy of the out patientcard of a hospital or in patient papers of the hospital or discharge summary is not an adequate record to prove torture. 13. Copies of the complaints lodged by the victim The victim might have already lodged some complaint to the authorities. We require the copies of those documents to structureand frame our complaint /report to the authorities and also for afollow up of the original complaint 14. Past verdict from the court or orders / communication from Authorities The victims may have obtained some verdict /communication from higher authorities before we reach them. T o go for an appeal before the higher authorities, we require the certified copy of the pastverdicts/ orders. 15. Visit the perpetrator The role played by alleged perpetrator has to be very clear. For this purpose, we encourage our staff has to meet the allegedperpetrator(s) and listen to what they have to say about the event. A detailed recording of the narrations of the alleged perpetrator in the case file is significant for later reference.We believe in basic humanitarian and democratic approach at all situations. So, We encourage our staff to visit the alleged perpetrator, his office or the location of the event of torture. Listen carefully tothe stories and versions of the perpetrator and his / her colleagues. Before arriving at a decision consider the physical and emotional trauma of the perpetrators also. If they require medical orPsychological attention we encourage our staff to arrange for medical or Psychological care for the alleged perpetrator also.
