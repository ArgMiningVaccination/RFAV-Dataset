We typically see the doctor, (M.D.) for many, if not all ailments\u2014but this is not the only remedy, and often, it can lead to one or more side effects. Alternatively, natural remedies usually have positive results. Care focused on you Some examples are chiropractic adjustments for headaches or backaches, acupuncture for anxiety or smoking cessation, and microcurrent therapy for pulled muscles. At BodyMind Wellness Center, we also believe each remedy or treatment to be another opportunity for enhancing your self-awareness, your knowledge of your body and how it responds to all forms of care.
