Thousands of state residents received info rmation on trees, crops, medically important arthropods, insect and plant pathogen pests, invasive plants, and soil analyses. New equipment was purchased for the Department of Analytical Chemistry, and persons were trained to participate in the Food Emer gency Response Network. Hundreds of food samples were tested for unwanted chemicals. Staff members who work in diagnostic laboratories in the Department of Plant Pat hology and Ecology are officially contributing to the National Plant Diagnostic Network. Mo lecular testing of pl ant tissues for the DNA of the organism that causes Ramorum blight (Sudden Oak Death) is being relied on to detect the plant pathogen. Forests are surveyed for emerging pest problems. Research programs, which have high public interest, are being further developed. Soybeans and rapeseed are being grown for possible biodiesel fuel production in the state. These plants offer added value because they can be used for feedstock, as cover crops, fertilizer, or to control plant para sitic nematodes. Community gardens are providing urban and suburban residents with fresh vegetables. Moreover, more than 110,000 mosquitoes were analyzed for West N ile and other encephalitis viruses during this reporting period. New crops, such as personal-sized watermelons, jilo, plums, grapes, and calabaza squash, are being evaluated at both research farms. Scientists and other staff members ha ve been very active in enhancing our outreach programs. Numerous scientific publ ications report on new findings. Articles are written for the public as we ll as scientists. Hundreds of talks and interviews were given to civic groups and repor ters to disseminate new t echnological information. The Station's popular website received more than 1.3 million successful hits. This Record of the Year re ports on a wide range of resear ch topics of interest to a broad base of stakeholders and clearly dem onstrates the dedication of the staff. The report has a new look with color pictures to enhance interest. Louis A.

At 11:30AM Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, Director, welcomed visitors to Plant Science Day 2005. The Century Farm Award was presented to the Tuller family of Tulmeadow Farm in West Simsbury, Connecticut by former Director Dr. John F. Anderson Members of the Tuller family have b een farming the land in West Simsbury continuously since 1768. Tulmeadow Farm, at 255 Farms Village Road, is currently operated by cousins Oliver \"Buzz\" Tuller, Jr. and Don Tuller. The 265-acre farm, comprised of fields and woodland, provides rural character to th e village of West Simsbury. Like many New England farms, diversific ation and changing with the times have been critical to the survival of the Tulmeadow Farm the last 237 years. Dairy production was a major focus until recently. Other past activities included poultry (meat and eggs), broadleaf tobacco, apples, charcoal and ci der brandy production, and sand and gravel sales. Today, sweet corn, tomatoes, greenhouse crops, and other farm-raised produce are marketed at the farm store. In addition, other local fruits, vegetables, food products, plants, and Christmas trees are sold. Prem ium ice cream is produced and sold at the farm, bringing approximately 90,000 visitors to the farm annually. Hay and beef production are developing product lines. The Tullers recently sold the developm ent rights on part of the farm to the Simsbury Land Trust. This will enable Tu lmeadow Farm to continue for future generations. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 17 The Tullers are active in agricultural or ganizations, including the Farm Service Agency Board and the Connecticut Farm Bureau, and belong to the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association.

Valley Laboratory Research Farm A total of 10,250 pounds of tomatoes, pumpkins , plums, watermelon and squash grown at the Valley Laboratory were donated to Foodsha re of Hartford, the Boy Scouts, the Sound School and Northwest Park of Windsor. Drs. Abigail Maynard, David Hill, Todd Mervosh and James LaMondia generated the fresh produce, and Dr. LaMondia organized the distribution effort. The Valley Laborator y also loaned irrigation equipment to the Connecticut Epilepsy Foundation in support of their Mud Volleyball Tournament Fundraiser. Mr. Horvath c oordinated the distribution of the irrigation equipment. LOCKWOOD LECTURES On November 14, 2005 Professor Wopke van der Werf, Plant Sciences Department, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Ne therlands, gave the Lockwood Lecture \"Potato Late Blight in the Netherlands: The National Research Initiative to Reduce Fungicide Dependence by Increased Resistance and Better Forecasting\". AWARDS AND RECOGNITION REC EIVED BY STATION STAFF Dr. Wade Elmer was named President of th e Northeastern Division of the American Phytopathological Society in October 2005 Dr. Joseph Pignatello was elected to Chair the S-11 Division (Soils and Environmental Quality) of the Soil Science Society of America for 2007 in November 2005 Dr. Joseph Pignatello was named by Thomson Sc ientific as an ISI Highly-Cited Author in the field of Engineering. He is among th e top 250 cited authors worldwide. In 2002 he was also named so in the field of Ec ology/Environment, where he maintains this distinction. ISI Highly-Cited Authors co mprise 0.5% on average of all publishing research. Dr. Walter Krol was elected Secretary of the New Haven Chapter of the American Chemical Society in January 2006 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 23 EXPERIMENT STATION ASSOCIATES Behind the Scenes Tour - Goodwin Conservation Center and Hull's Forest Products, Pomfret, CT On April 26, 2006 ESA members took a bus ride to the Goodwin Conservation Center where they were greeted by Forester/Supervisor Steve Broderick. The participants were divided into two groups and visi ted a historic house, a museum , and a small section of the James Goodwin State Forest that demonstrated the issues of a \"managed forest\" Dr. Jeffrey Ward of the Station addressed the group at lunchtim e, as did Steve Broderick. After lunch, members boarded the bus for a ten minute ride to Hu ll's Forest Products, Inc. Hull's is a modern, hi-tech saw mill that utilizes the entire tree - bark, sawdust, and both high and low grade wood. The operation showed why active forest management makes financial and environmental sense. 24 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 THE PRESS SPEAKS On July 6, 2005 The Hartford Courant carried the article \"How Perilous Pesticides? by Kathleen Megan. The article examined the da ngers of pesticide residues in food. The Station's program of sampling fresh and pro cessed food in the state was reported on. Dr. MaryJane Incoria Mattina stated that about 300 samples are taken each year and that generally only two or three vi olate pesticide regulations. Sh e stated \"We are always on the lookout for those people who inadvertently or knowingly decide to play outside the rules of the game\". Regarding residue levels found she stated \"Most of these are at the trace level\". On July 11, 2005 The New Haven Register carr ied the article \"Experiment Station gains $1.3M in federal funds\" by Abram Katz. A visit by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro was reported on. During her visit, Congresswoman DeLauro announced that there would be a $1.3M aid package to the St ation, expanding the federal slice of the lab's budget by almost 40 percent. DeLauro helped secure the money which will be used in many areas of the research done at the Station. Congre sswoman DeLauro also stated that she was hopeful to get more funding which will be used to renovate Jenkins Laboratory and build a new lab for testing food safety - a ma jor bioterrorism concern. Congresswoman DeLauro stated \"The Agricultural Experime nt Station remains a national leader in biochemistry, food security and genetics, on entomology, on forestry and horticulture. I want to see that the tradition of groundbreaking research continues\". The Record Journal of July 23, 2005 carried the article \"Robins blamed for virus spread\". The article reported the finding by Dr. The odore Andreadis that DNA tests on blood from mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus indicate that robins, and not crows as was believed, are the main culprits in transmitting the viru s. He has also reported that salt marsh mosquitoes instead of house mosquitoes, as was previously believed, are the other primary transmitter of West Nile virus. The Connecticut Post of August 4, 2005 carried the article \"Connecting With Nature: Outdoor Defenses - Experts advise on We st Nile, weeds during science expo\", by John Burgeson. The article reported on Plant Scie nce Day 2005 at Lockwood Farm. Some of the areas reported on in the article were Dr . Theodore Andreadis' display on West Nile Virus, Dr. Todd L. Mervosh's display of 150 i nvasive weeds, and Dr. Robert E. Marra's Ramorum Blight information. Other displays and inform ation tents and talks were mentioned in the article. The New York Times of August 7, 2005 carri ed the article \"Another Tick Disease Turning up in Dogs\" by Gail Braccidiferro. Th e same tick that spreads Lyme disease has been found to carry another di sease that affects dogs. Ehrlichia equi or Anaplasma phagocytophilum , almost unknown in the U.S.A. until 10 years ago, is becoming more common. Dr. Louis Magnarelli stated that \"Going back to around 1990, no one knew this was even in the United States. Around 1994, some human cases were reported in the Midwest. It is distributed where you find Lyme disease.\" Dr. Steven A. Levy, a Durham The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 25 veterinarian, reported that a 2002 study he c onducted found that about 23 percent of the dogs in his study had been exposed to the disease organism. The Hartford Courant of September 16, 2005 carried the article \"Lyme Ticks Show Major Rise in State\" by Garret Condon. In summer 2005, there were record numbers of Lyme-disease-causing ticks throughout Connectic ut, but especially in Lyme, Old Lyme and East Haddam where Lyme disease got its name. Dr. Kirby Stafford stated \"Young tick counts were higher in southwestern and northwestern Connecticut, but the most dramatic increase was in Lyme/Old Lyme, wh ich had an 80 to 90 percent increase over the numbers we picked up last year.\" Dr. Sta fford said that the incr ease in numbers could be related to last winter's weather. \"If you have a lot of snow, it acts like an insulating blanket and the ticks are doing ju st fine underneath\". He pr edicted an increase in Lyme disease cases for the year. The New Haven Register of September 16 carri ed the article \"State Joins Suit to Stop Use of Ozone-depleting Pesticide\" by Ab ram Katz. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has filed suit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which requires incoming cargo ships from China to fumigate wooden pallets with methyl bromide. Methyl bromide is highly toxic and damage s the environment by eating away the ozone layer. Also, treatment with the chemical is easily faked as it does not alter the appearance of wood in any way. Treatment is necessary to kill beetles and other pests. When asked to alter their policy, the USDA refused. Dr. Kirby Stafford stated that there is little data on the effectiveness of methyl bromide. He said the chemical may penetrate up to four inches in a piece of wood. The gas would not seep as deeply into wood with a high moisture content. The New York Times of September 25, 2005 carried the article \"Weather Suits Mosquitoes Fine\" by Jane Gordon. Dr. The odore Andreadis was interviewed about an article on cases of West Nile Virus in Connecticut and othe r northeastern states in the 2005 season. Although the weather was unusuall y hot and dry for most of the summer, which kept the mosquito population down, the rain and hot muggy w eather late in the season was perfect for mosquitoes to breed in th e state. Several cases of West Nile were reported this year. Dr. Andreadis stated that \"mosquitoes are out there, they are biting. ... I wouldn't be surprised if we see a few add itional cases of West Nile virus before the season is over.\" The Hartford Courant of October 7, 2005 carri ed the article \"Elderly Man Dies from West Nile Infection, by William Hathaway. Th e article reported that an elderly man from New Britain was the first Connecticut resident to die from West N ile virus in 2005. His death indicated that West Nile virus, which was on the wane in the state last year, has made a comeback. Dr. Theodore Andreadis st ated that \"This death sadly reaffirms once again that this virus is here and it is not going away.\" This was the third reported case in the state in 2005. Dr. Andreadis stated th at the dry weather fo r much of the season squelched the mosquito population, but many mo re of the mosquitoes trapped were found to be carrying West Nile. Infected human biting mosquitoes were found in 18 towns in 26 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Connecticut, compared with only five in 2004. Most were found in Fairfield and New Haven Counties. The Winter 2006 issue of Ca ndlewood Lake News - Annual Report of Candlewood Lake Authority featured the article \"Project C LEAR Hits Home With Students, Teachers and Community\". The article reported on an in-depth study of Candlewood Lake and its surroundings by 40 students from Danbury, Bro okfield, New Milford, New Fairfield and Bethel High Schools. 8 teachers from the school districts and staff from CLA, Education Connection, the CT DEP, the Northwest C onservation District and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station participat ed in the group teaching, including stream ecology and water quality, lake wa ter quality; aquatic invasive plants; the fish population in the lake, ecology, habitat a nd erosion of Candlewood's isla nds; and assessments of the property along developed areas around the lake. The Spring 2006 issue of OnEarth, a publica tion of the Natural Resources Defense Council, published the article \"Saving an American Icon\" by Susan Freinkel. The article was a history of the chestnut blight in th e very early 1900's and how, through the years, scientists as well as ordinary citizens have b een working hard to bring back the American Chestnut. The work of Dr. Sandra Anagnos takis was highlighted in the article. The Hartford Courant of March 20, 2006 carried the article \"Program to Monitor Invasive Plants\". The article focused on a lake mon itoring program that will be carried out by volunteers who will try to stem the wave of i nvasive aquatic plants that are choking out native plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds . These plants ofte n hinder recreational activities on the lakes then invade and pull pr operty values down. Once established, they are almost impossible to eradicate. Works hops conducted by Station staff will begin in the spring and will teach people how to identify the most serious invasive aquatic plants so problems can be caught in early stages. The Connecticut Post of March 27, 2006 carri ed the article \"Counting on Fungus to Fight Off Gypsy Moths\" by Marian Gail Brown. Th e article reported that 20 years after the last time that gypsy moths devoured the leaves of over a million acres of trees in CT forests and on private property, they are att acking again. It was estimated that between July 2004 and 2005 gypsy moth caterpillars de foliated 64,373 acres in the state. The caterpillars had been kept in check by a fungus that depends on moisture in the ground. The amount of damage done will depend on the sp ring rain during mid-May into June. If sufficient rain falls during that period, a bumper crop of the fungus will grow and will combat the caterpillars.\" The Hartford Courant's Editorial Page of April 18, 2006 carried the article \"A Call to Repel Alien Invaders\". The choking off of many of Connecticut's ponds and lakes was reported on. Several kinds of alien plant speci es have found their way into the water and have grown into both a nuisance to those who use the bodies of water for recreation and a threat to many species of wildlife. The article announced that the Station would be holding two workshops to teach people what kinds of weeds to look for and how to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 27 identify them. Volunteers are needed to re cognize the plants a nd report them to the Station so that an attempt to eradicate them can be made. The Hartford Courant of April 30, 2006 carri ed the article \"State Lakes Invaded by Plants: Survey Recommends Close Monitoring\" by Steve Grant. Dr. Robert Capers was interviewed for the article. He explained a series of works hops being held by the Station recruiting citizens to monitor lakes in Connectic ut for invasive aquatic weeds. He said that after a two year study, the weeds we re found to be in tw o-thirds of the 100 Connecticut lakes surveyed. Since the beginning of the st udy, two new invasive weeds were found to be in the lakes. He stated th at the best way to control them was to find them early before they are established. Once established, they can be nearly impossible to eradicate. (At least five other articles in ar ea newspapers carried articles similar to this one. The Hartford Courant (April) carried the article \"Cases of Lyme disease up 34% in state\". In a year when the national average of nu mber cases of Lyme disease per 100,000 people was 6.7, Connecticut's number of cases wa s 39.6 per 100,000 people. Windham County had the highest number of cases in the state. Dr. Kirby Stafford stated that weather conditions influence the populations of animals that ticks feed on, which in turn affects how many ticks get blood meals. He stated \"The gross number is kind of tied with the deer population, because the number of deer is one of the main determinants of what the overall number of ticks is\". The Journal News of May 30, 2006 carried the article \"Port Chester students learn about saving endangered trees by Greg Clary. Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis, referred to as a modern-day equivalent of Johnny Appleseed, except with chestnuts, visited a Living Science class at Port Chester School and gave them a historical background of how the American Chestnut tree, once a dominant species in the northeast, disappeared from the landscape. Her visit coincided with an Eart h Day celebration where the students planted 40 chestnut hybrids on the school grounds. The Hartford Courant carried the article \"R elentless Rain Means Skillions of Skeeters\" by William Weir. The article reported that reco rd amounts of rain in the spring will bring an abundance of mosquitoes. Dr. Theodore Andr eadis pointed out that even before peak mosquito season started the numbers were well above normal. He stated that all indicators showed that it wa s going to be a bad summer for mo squitoes and that while the species that was abundant in the spring wasn 't a threat for West Nile virus or EEE, species following later on were carriers of EEE. He gave advice to homeowners to use larvicide in any standing water sources in or der to keep the mosqu ito populations down. The article went on to report on research being done in many countries to control mosquitoes. The Hartford Courant of June 11, 2006 carried a Letter to the Edito r entitled \"Supporting Dairy Farmers\" by Jennifer Frank of the Frie nds of Town Farm Dairy. She was happy to see an article on Connecticut dairy farms in the Courant and wrote about the support a dairy farm in Simsbury was getting. Sh e mentioned being grateful to several 28 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 organizations that helped small farms thr oughout Connecticut and Th e Station was one of those organizations. The Norwich Bulletin of June 18, 2006 carried the article \"Expert: Beware Bug-Borne Diseases\" by Francesca Kefalas. On June 18, Governor Rell put out a press release alerting the public that The Connecticut Agri cultural Experiment Station had trapped more than double the number of biting mosquitoes compared to the same time last year. All the wet spring weather has made the mosquito population explode. Dr. Theodore Andreadis stated that \"if you are going to be outside, you're going to have to bring along a can of repellent.\" Regarding West Nile vi rus, Dr. Andreadis stated \"We know that the virus is still here and we e xpect it to reemerge.\" Easter n Equine Encephalitis, another mosquito-borne illness, is also occurring in the northeast. Dr. Andreadis said \"We are very, very fortunate. All of our neighboring st ates have reported it in humans. We have been very lucky here.\" The Day of June 25, 2006 carried the article \"Sudden Death in the Marsh: Mysterious Dieback Threatens Critical Coastal Ecosyste m\" by Judy Benson. Something is attacking and killing the salt marshes throughout New England. What is killing the marshes has not been determined yet. Dr. Wade Elmer is one of the scientists looking for the answer. He suspects a form of fusarium is the cause . Upon examination, the spores resemble a form found in the Sudan. Speculation is th at the fungus spores were carried on a dust cloud that originated off of the African continent. Dr. Elmer stated that at first he thought the theory was far-fetched, but now he is not so sure anymore. \"They seem to be a unique species. It looks lik e a whole new group of fusaium than what we had been seeing in New England.\" \"It's really a challenge to sort this all out.\" The Record Journal of June 30, 2006 carried the article \"Mosquitoes are Loving this Swampy Weather\" by Ralph Hohman. Dr. Th eodore Andreadis was quoted throughout the article on the Station's research on West Nile Virus, the numbers of cases in the state last year, the numbers of mosquitoes captured and tested, and ways to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that cause the disease. The Hartford Courant of June 30, 2006 carried the article \"Unwelcome Guests: A Field Guide to Household and Garden Pests - and a Battle Plan for Each\" by Theresa Sullivan Barger. Methods to prevent or eradicate pe sts from homes were discussed. Many types of pests - animal and insect - invade thous ands of homes every year. Experts were consulted on the various types of pests. Gale Ridge was quoted throughout the article on getting rid of many types of insects. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 29 THE PUBLIC SPEAKS On July 3, 2005 Alisha Desilva wrote the follow ing to Dr. Kirby Stafford. \"Just wanted to inform you that I received your informati on packet in the mail and was very impressed with the content. Especially useful to me was the repellent information, land management and treatment. On the phone, we had discussed early prophylaxis of Lyme disease - one single 200mg dos e of Doxycycline.

It will be very useful, and it was a great pleasure to ge t such a prompt and helpful response to an unusual question.\" On August 3, 2005, Kenneth N. Bacon wrote the following to Dr. Sharon Douglas. \"Many thanks for all the fascinating reading matter about trees and shrubs that you sent to me and for indicating those trees you thi nk might do the trick for me. I have become so involved in the subject that I'm beginning to feel a bit like what Joyce Kilmer must have to pen that memorable poem, \"Trees\". My poetry writing has never transcended much beyond the limerick category, so perhaps th ere's hope for me. So far, the nurseries I have been able to contact have only the usual and commonplace types of trees, the Honeylocust receiving the greatest push, pr obably because they have a goodly supply of them. In any event, I never give up easily a nd actually the apparent challenge developing has become sort of fun.

Slayback, CPG, LEP, Chairman at Leggette, Brashears & Graham, Inc. wrote the following letter to Governor M. Jodi Rell regarding his experience in working with Drs. Mattina, Mervosh, Kroll, Stafford and Stoner. \"I thought you would like to hear of an exceptiona lly satisfactory experience I had seeking information and assistance from The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. As an Environmental and Hydrogeologic Consultant, I was recently asked by representatives of the Region 14 School District in Woodbury and Bethlehem to assist them in a plan to convert District land, which had been leased for many years to a \"cow corn\" farmer, to athletic fields for the schools. The is sue was whether there are unsafe levels of agricultural chemicals in the soil, which might be a health hazard to children using the fields. I contacted The Connecticut Agricult ural Experiment Station in New Haven and eventually spoke to senior scie ntists at this and their Windsor facility. Every individual I spoke with was courteous, helpful, extr emely knowledgeable, and each followed up with specific information for my use. It was gratifying to learn how professional these scientists are - when I raised questions outside an individual's specific area of expertise, I was directed immediately to a different spec ialist who had the answers. When it was determined that the property owner was a re gional school district, in fact a form of municipal government, Dr. Mattina advised th at the agency could analyze a reasonable number of soil samples without direct charge to the district. To comply with regulations, the sampling was conducted by the Pomperaug Di strict Health Department. We were asked to make a voluntary contribution to the Station, which wa s a fraction of the commercial laboratory cost for the analyses requ ired. That contribution will be made. In my work, I deal with numerous department s of the state government, and this was a refreshing change of experience. The individuals copied on th is letter are the specific scientists who assisted me.

Your discussion on the economic impact of cankers on black birch wa s very meaningful. Your comments about why the population of black birch has signifi cantly increased because of decreased feeding by animals (such as deer and specific in sects) has strengthened my lectures on the complexity of ecosystems. Your injection of the \"Kindergarten Effect\" clearly explained why population ecology is so important in pa rasitology. Also your comments of why disturbance in a forest is so important in th e spread of the disease also underscored the basic principles of ecology. Few people toda y have any concept of our environmental history and how things have ra dically changed. Your enthusiasm really captivates my The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 33 students. On our drive to the Station, I me ntioned that one of the researchers from the Station would really catch thei r attention. On the drive ba ck to the university, several students said that I understated your enthusiasm. Students today are so used to professors who often tend to be boring at best, and when an enthusiastic rese arch biologist comes along, they really take note. It is importan t that students learn th at applied, practical research is just as important as pure re search.

Your discussion on the history of Phytopthora ramorum and the importance of the nursery industry in its spread was most appropriate for my students. Your mention of Koch's Postul ates and how a disease is detected and diagnosed, reinforced how all of the basic biol ogical principles that are taught in today's biology curricula are importa nt. Your discussion vi ndicated my insistence on understanding the importance of pathogenic organism s. It is important that students learn that applied, practical research is just as important as pure research. Because biology today emphasizes molecular research, it has be come my mission to expose my students to the world of organisms and how they relate to molecular biology.

Service functions include the analysis of samples submitted by State agencies, other Stati on departments, municipal agencies, and health departments throughout Connecticut. The research which we pursue is primarily service-driven, catalyzed, for the most part, by the required analys es of submitted samples. It consists of a variety of applied studies in Analytical Ch emistry. Some of the applied studies have been developed by department scientists in to fundamental research in Environmental Chemistry. One such peer-reviewed study, repo rted in MaryJane J.C. White \"Uptake by Cucurbitaceae of Soil- Borne Contaminants Depends upon Plant Genotype and Pollutant Properties\" Environ. Sci. & Technol. 40:1814-1821 (2006), was selected to re ceive the paper of the year award from the Quinnipiac chapter of the scientific society, Sigma Xi. Beyond the service and research activities, all Analytical Chemists are involved in outreach activities by providing information to the citizens of Connecticut via telephone inquiries, tours of our laborator ies, and assistance directly to Connecticut businesses. More and more often inquiries from citizens in other states and nations are directed to us for response via the Internet. Some examples of our outreach activities are provided here and elaborated in the following sections. Of special note, on 20 April 2006 the Department was designated by Director Magna relli to host the Stat ion's annual spring event. With the content of the day's program for this Open House focused on Analytical's involvement with public safet y, we provided examples of how scientists pursue the Station's motto of \"Putting Science to Work for Society.\" The day's talks were covered by the Connecticut Public A ffairs Network, CT-N, for live viewing and subsequent streaming on the Internet. More detailed information is provided below. In addition, our staff participates in many ac tivities directed primarily to the surrounding, greater New Haven community, for example, the New Haven Public Schools Science Fair and the New Haven community gardens. Drs. Eitzer and Stilwell continue to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Sound School in New Haven. Dr. Walter Krol has been elected secretary of the New Haven ch apter of the American Chemical Society. The most noteworthy development within the time period covered in this Record is the selection of the Department of Analy tical Chemistry to receive multi-year funding under a competitive Cooperative Agreement Program with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One of only eight state laboratories thr oughout the country to be selected, Analytical Chemistry is greatly pleased by the recognition which the CAP 92 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 accords our staff and its work, and by the opportunity it provides to contribute significantly to protect ing the nation's food supply. Our work within FERN, the Food Emergency Response Network., compliments nicely Dr. Mattina's long-term participation in the Laboratory Preparedness Advisory Committee chaired by the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Summaries of the Department's servi ce and research activities and other highlights for the past year are described in detail below. SERVICE ACTIVITIES ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment St ation traces its origins to 1875. That year it was established as the nation's first e xperiment station for the analysis of feed and fertilizer products on behalf of the ag ricultural community, a function envisioned by Agricultural Chemist, Samuel W. Johns on. Johnson was a scientist of national prominence, serving as an expert witness in several high profile criminal cases in New Haven and one of the first presidents of the American Chemical Soci ety. The Analytical Chemistry Department continues to conduct st ate-mandated feeds and fertilizer analyses in order to assure that such products sold in Connecticut are in compliance with the label guarantees printed on the products. These an alyses are performed by Craig Musante and Mamie Pyles under the supervision of Dr. David Stilwell. Feeds: Feed samples analyzed include products for both household pets and commercial agricultural operations. The samp les are collected by the Department of Agriculture and submitted to the Analytical Ch emistry Department for analysis. From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, we analyzed 93 sample s for parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, and fiber. We continue to analy ze an increased number of feed samples for micronutrients such as calcium, copper, sele nium, molybdenum, etc. Deficient samples, which totaled 44 (47.3%), are re ported based on the analytical variations specified in the Official Publication of the Association of American F eed Control Officials. Fertilizers: For the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, we analyzed 120 fertilizer samples collected by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture. This includes products intended for both commercial and reside ntial applications. Analytical results for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, availabl e phosphoric acid, and potash, and increasingly for micronutrients, such as boron, sulfur, coba lt, magnesium, and iron, are compared with label guarantees. Samples with deficienci es in macronutrients or in one or more micronutrients numbered 55 (45.8%). Deficiencies are determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the O fficial Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials. IMPACT: Product guarantees are a critical com ponent assuring the robustness of the nation's agricultural operations. The staff in Analytical Chemistry has an established reputation for accurate and rapid surveill ance of agricultural products. With the heightened potential for attacks on the nation's economy and the well-being of its The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 93 citizens, this capability is of renewed importa nce. These analyses provide a route for our chemists to contribute to assuring pr otection from those persons focused on contamination of animal feed products and the concomitant injury to the agricultural industry. ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION FOOD and STANDARDS DIVISION Pesticide residues in food: During the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, inspectors from the Food and Standards Di vision submitted 142 samples of fresh and processed foods for pesticide residue analys is. The majority of samples represent Connecticut grown produce, although produce grown in other states, foreign grown produce, and organically labelled samples are also collected. Processed foods, such as juices, ciders, and baby food, are included in our survey as well. Dr. Walter Krol has responsibility for the market basket program. However, with the acq uisition of additional instrumentation, some of which represents new technology in our laboratory, both Terri Arsenault and Dr. Brian Eitzer participate in conducting these analyses. The results of our pesticide residue program are published in an annual Station Bulletin, which is available online on the Station's web site. Th e most recent Bulletin presents data from the 2002 through 2004 surveys. During the preceding twelve months we re ported to the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection that 10 of the 142 samples were violative. Some of the violations derived from analyses on our ne wly acquired instrument ation and were not previously accessible. These will be discussed in more detail below. Other samples: In addition to the above food samples analyzed for pesticide residues, we received 151 samples from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006. Many of these samples originate from consumer complaints to the Department of Consumer Protection and involve potential product tampering or filth. For those samples containing foreign material such as plant or fungal substances, we rely frequently on the expertise of Dr. Sharon Douglas and Mary Inman of the De partment of Plant Pathology and Ecology. Mr. Kenneth Welch and Gale Ridge of the De partment of Entomology assist on a routine basis for identifications resulti ng from insect infestation. An example of the determination of an insect pest of concern derived from four samples of dried soup mix in which a consumer alleged finding insects. Analytical Chemistry collaborated with Gale Ridge in the Department of Entomology who made a tentative identification of the Khapra beetle (Trogoderma, see photo at left). This importe d insect pest was confirmed by entomologists from the USDA. Because of the level of interest in this finding, extensive follo w-up investigations by USDA staff at the manufacturing operation have been conducted. PRODUCT SAFETY DIVISION 94 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 During the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, we analyzed 9 samples for the Product Safety Division. The samples were children's toys submitted for determination of lead content. LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION During the period covered in this recor d, our department analyzed 2 samples to determine the authentic ity of a rum product for potential mis-branding. The officers of this division have come to rely on our laboratory for information of this type. IMPACT: The rapid and accurate response for the analysis of samples submitted to our laboratory is consistent with th e level of training and experien ce of the staff in Analytical Chemistry. It is this quality which ha s been recognized by federal agencies and acknowledged through our receipt of the C ooperative Agreement. Response of the caliber, which our chemists provide, is critical in cases of intentional contamination or terrorist activities. ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU PCBs and pesticides: The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection is charged with compliance monitoring within the state in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rode nticide Act (FIFRA). In s upport of these activities, for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 our labor atory analyzed 132 samples on behalf of the Connecticut DEP, including foliage, water, fa bric, and air samples. Of these samples, 38 consisted of wipes, soils, water, and transformer oils, and were submitted for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) analysis. These analyses were performed by William Berger under the supervision of Dr. Brian Eitzer. IMPACT: Rapid and accurate reporting of polychl orinated biphenyls in the environment can be critical to clean-up and health issues. Our scientists have been able to provide analytical results to the appropriate staff at Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to assure the safety of sites accessible to the public. ANALYSES FOR DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE SERVICES EXCISE & PUBLIC SERVICES TAXES SUBDIVISION Beer, Wine and Liquor: Distributors of alcoholic beverages must pay a tax on all sales of such beverages within the State of Connecticut. To assist Revenue Services with the levy of the tax, we determine the alcohol content of beers, wine coolers, ciders, distilled liquors, and other alc oholic beverages sold in the St ate. From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, we analyzed a total of 170 samples fo r alcohol content. It should be noted that several samples were submitted by br ew pubs, microbreweries, and importers operating within the State of Connecticut. We have made a special attempt to complete and submit determinations for these start- up Connecticut businesses as rapidly as possible. Such accommodation has been duly noted by a number of such businesses, as The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 95 well as out-of-state facilities which have ma de requests to our laboratory for particularly rapid determinations. ANALYSES FOR MUNICIPAL AGENCIES In the period covered by this report, we were requested by the Ohio Department of Agriculture to analyze 39 samples of maple syrup for lead content. During this same time period, we served as a referee laboratory for determination of dieldrin in a feed sample sent to us by the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture. We were asked to analyze a sample that originated at the Emergency Room of Hartford Hospital. The sample consisted of a jug of fruit punch for possible contamination with ethylene glycol which ha d been allegedly consumed by a patient. Brian Eitzer quickly developed a SPME method for determination of ethylene glycol in the liquid and we were able to report back th at the liquid was approximately half ethylene glycol. In May 2006, a sample of white powde r was brought to our laboratories for identification. Since 9/11 such samples requ ire a heightened leve l of response. We coordinated the response with local police and fire department s, incident response centers and the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Within five hours of the sample arriving at our facility, it was determined that it did not represent a threat to public health. For several years our laboratory has a ssisted non-profit organizations throughout Connecticut with the establishment of commun ity gardens. Located primarily in urban areas, it is important to determine that the so il at these sites is not contaminated with toxic heavy metals which could present a health hazard to persons working on the project. Again in the period covered by th is report David Stilwell and Craig Musante provided analyses of soils in New London and New Haven. We are attempting to design and coordinate with Valley Laboratory and University of Connecticut Extension a large project for collecting and anal yzing soils from community gardens across the state. ANALYSES FOR OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS We actively support work done principally in other Station Departments. In the twelve month period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, we analyzed 56 samples submitted by other departments. Samples were subm itted primarily by the Valley Laboratory in Windsor. Several of these samples were soils from planned community gardens in urban locations with potential c ontamination from heavy metals such as lead. ANALYSES OF CHECK SAMPLES The value of the data generated by th e staff of the Analytical Chemistry Department depends on its accuracy and precisio n. While each scientist makes sure that the analyses for specific analyses as desc ribed in our in-house Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) contain ade quate quality control such as spiked and blank samples, we also participate in a variety of form al check and performance evaluation sample programs. Primary among these are perfor mance evaluation samples reported back to our certifying agency, Connecticut Department of Public Health. We also participate in 96 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 the Southern States Check Sample program to monitor the reliability of our analyses related to the market basket survey. In addition to the long-standing check samples mentioned above, during the past year we have participated in several profic iency tests related to our FERN work. More specific information is provided below. FOOD SAFETY ACTIVITIES By far the largest impact on activities in the Department of Analytical Chemistry in the past several years ha s been our involvement with the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN), in general, and our se lection as Cooperative Agreement Program (CAP) laboratory, in particular. While co mmitments to FERN and CAP are numerous, it is essential to maintain all of our previous service work on behalf of Connecticut state agencies, as well as our research projects. The challenge is one of assuring that these commitments compliment each other as much as possible rather than being distinct and isolated pathways. We provide examples of how the Department's Analytical Chemists are assuring this complementarity. One newly acquired technology in our Department is liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS). By interfacing an LC functioning in our department since 2001, with an MS purchased in part thr ough funds received from the Connecticut Department of Public Health, we have es tablished instrumenta tion required by our CAP participation. Brian Eitzer has dedicated mo st of his work to mastering this equipment and using it for our CAP assignments, our market basket food samples, and several environmental samples. Accordingly, we ha ve increased substant ially the number of agrochemicals which we report out to several st ate agencies. This, in turn, has impacted detection of violative samples. Walter Krol has taken on th e responsibility of incorporating new active i ngredients into our GC/MS and LC/MS methods. Terri Arsenault is investigating replacing our long-standing method for preparing market basket samples with an alternative method to save resources and to permit both GC/MS and LC/MS analyses with the same extract. Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer, and Terri Arsenault (L. to R.) examine data acquired on our LC/MS system. As a result of our CAP funding, we have acquired instrumentation to conduct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dr. Christina Robb (at left) uses this method for the detection of FERN-specified t oxins in food matrices. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 97 Also, as a result of CAP fundi ng, we have installed in our laboratory inductively coupled plasma interfaced with a mass spectrometry detector. This will permit us to increase the number of elements which we can identify and considerably lower detecti on levels. In the photo as left David Stilwell and Craig Musante (L. to R.) work on the ICP/MS while Mamie Pyles conducts feeds and fertilizer analyses in the background. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Studies of Persistent Organic Pollutants and Terrestrial Plants\u2014Mechanisms of Uptake. In 1990, we were intrigued by our observati on of persistent orga nochlorine pesticide (POP) residues in certain crops. POPs such as DDT, chlordane, and heptachlor have not been permitted for use on food crops in the United States for more than 20 years. Nevertheless, trace residues of these com pounds have been found by us and others in produce, including some produce grown on farms which have not used any pesticides for more than a decade. The sources of the pr oduce contaminated with POPs comprise not only Connecticut-grown crops, but crops from other states, as well as imported crops. Our market basket data anecdotally suggested that specific crops se lectively uptake POPs from soil, while other crops do not contain POPs in their edible tissues. In 1997, we initiated experiments to inve stigate issues suggested by the anecdotal observations. Several components of our investigation have been completed and several new lines of research are in progress. We are actively studying the mechanisms of uptake of soil-bound persistent organic pollutants by the Cucu rbitaceae plant famil y, using the optical handle that some of these compounds possess, via analyses base d on chiral gas chromatography with ion trap mass spectrometry detection. The most recent publication from our research group, MaryJane Incorvia Mattina, M. Isleyen, B. D. \"Uptake by Cucurbitaceae of Soil-Borne ontaminants Depends upon and Pollutant Properties\" Environ. Sci. & Technol. 40:1814-1821 (2006) has received the paper of the year award from th e Quinnipiac chapter of Sigma Xi. This work is directly re lated to phytoremediation. Phytoremediation remains a long-term goal for the treatment of soil contam inated with organic pollutants as it has the potential to be a less expensive in-situ treatment process. By studying the uptake of POPs from soil by Cucurbitacea in gree nhouse rhizotrons, we can examine the rhizosphere soil, porewater, a nd xylem sap on a very detailed basis using solid phase microextraction (SPME). Once released to the soil porewater, different species of Cucurbitacea have vastly different capabilities regarding the uptake and translocation of contaminants. Our recent acquisition of automated SPME (see photo at left) will considerably enhance our research efforts. 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Bill Berger and MaryJane Incorvia Mattina set up samples for automated SPME on a new GC/ITD. We have recently found that Arabadopsis thalinia can translocate POPs from soil to aerial tissue. This species is very well char acterized genetically. It is, therefore, hoped that by studying the uptake of pollutants by di fferent ecotypes of this species, we can learn which genes are important in the uptake of pollutant chemicals. This in turn could lead to enhancements in the ability of plants to uptake and transl ocate pollutants, which could subsequently make phytoremediation a trul y viable alternative for the treatment of contaminated soil. Food Safety: In the arena of food safety most of our work over the past several months relates to our Cooperative Ag reement participatio n. Walter Krol has determined the current list of active ingredients registered fo r use by the U.S. EPA. He has followed this up by obtaining all chemical standards not in our inventory. Using this list, he has updated our GC/MS method to included detection of thes e agrochemicals. Following on this initiative, Terri Arsena ult and Brian Eitzer have been working to include this expanded list of A.I. into our GC/MS and LC/MS methods for FERN. To date Brian Eitzer has examined over 100 different compounds on our newly acquired LC/MS. Along with newly developed methods he can now detect almost 20 different herbicides in soil and water matrices. As well as greatly expanding the number of agrochemicals we can now detect using LC/M S, we are exploring a revised method for extraction of food samples which will reduce co nsumption of solvents and make analysis by GC/MS and LC/MS possible from a single extract. Environmental Studies on the Use of Pressure Treated Wood : This project focuses on the environmental effects of the use of wood, which has been pressure treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) preservativ e. The pressure treatment causes the preservative to penetrate deeply into the w ood, typically, in concentr ations of between of between 0.1-0.2 percent. As of January 2004, this formulation was phased out for residential uses. However, massive amounts of CCA wood are expected to remain in-service for many years, raising concerns that dispersal of these addi tives could impact the environment. Arsenic uptake by plants grow n near CCA wood structures is an area of potential concern. In gardens, CCA treated wood is used for borders, raised beds, posts and stakes. Typically, plants are also grow n around the perimeter of deck s, patios and porches, all of which may contain CCA wood. During this twelve-month period, we finished trials on the effect of coatings on leaching and subse quent arsenic uptake by plants. Planting boxes constructed using CCA wood were coated w ith various finishes, filled with soil, weathered for two years, and then planted w ith leafy vegetables. Opaque, film-forming finishes were found to form an effective barr ier to arsenic leaching and subsequent plant uptake. The reduction in plant As ranged fr om 50-84% in plants grown next to the opaque finished wood, and by growing plants 6 cm away from the w ood the reduction in arsenic ranged from 55-84% compared to plants grown next to the wood. This ongoing work on the many aspects of the impact of the use of CCA-treated wood has been widely recognized. Dr. Stilwe ll served on the EPA scientific advisory The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 99 panel (SAP) on the risk assessment of CCA wood, by invitation during 2001, 2003, and 2005, and presented a paper on this work (by invitation) at a symposium on the environmental effects of wood preservatives. Dr. Stilwell is assisted in this project by Craig Musante. Heavy Metals in Community Garden Soils: We re conducting an ongoing program on the environmental impacts of lead and other h eavy metals in community garden soils and plants. Previously, we found that the bioavailability of lead in these soils decreased with increasing phosphorus content. Extracti on experiments using various forms of phosphorus are underway in an effort optimi ze the use of phosphorus to immobilize lead. Plant tissue analysis for trace amounts of l ead is now possible with the acquisition of a new instrument- the ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectroscopy). This new method allows us to determine lead and other heavy metals at sub part-per-billion (ppb) levels, about an order of magnitude lower than we were previously able to achieve. Method development using this ICP-MS for pl ant and soil analysis of heavy metals is underway. Dr. Stilwell is assisted in this project by Craig Musante. PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive frequent calls from the public requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and in the environment, lead in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances we refer the caller to a more appropriate Station Departme nt or State agency. We typically handle over 1000 such inquiries each year. As more persons gain access to the Internet , inquiries are coming from beyond Connecticut. Station Bulletins : Station Bulletins are typically published annually by our Department. These bulletins are available in printed form and on the Station's web site. They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. Fact Sheets : Listed on the Station's web site und er \"Publications\" are several articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest. These are also available in printed format. De partment members also cooperate with the Connecticut Department of Public Health in producing fact sheets published by them. New Haven Sound School : Two members of our Department, Drs. David Stilwell and Brian Eitzer, serve on the advisory council of New Haven Public School's Sound School. New Haven Public School Science Fair : This past year both Walter Krol and David Stilwell served as judges for this well established science fair. 20 April Open House: The Station hosts two major even ts annually, Plant Science Day in the Spring in April and Plant Science Day in August at Lockwood Farm. This year Dr. Magnarelli chose \"public safety \" as the theme of the Apri l event and requested that Analytical Chemistry host the day, preparing talks and tours. Because of the public 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 safety orientation and the nature of invited participants from outsi de of the Station, we decided to call the April event an Open House. The afternoon began with three talks by scientists from Analytical Chemistry: \"CCA Pressure Treated Wood in the Hous e and Garden\" focused on research by Dr. David Stilwell and Craig Musante; \"Pestici de Residues in Food\u2014Keeping Current with New Products:\" described work by Dr. Walter Kr ol and Terri Arsenault; and in the talk \"Safeguarding the Nation's Food Supply\u2014and Mo re\" Dr. Mary Jane Incorvia Mattina described the recent work in the food safety arena in which all Analytical staff is participating. Following the talks most of the audience participat ed in tours of the Department of Analytical Chemistry, Bios afety Level 3 Laboratory, Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory. We were especially pleased that also avai lable for tours were the mobile laboratory from the 14th Connecticut National Guard Civil Support Team and the mobile laboratory from the Connecticut De partment of Environmental Protection. The event was broadcast by CT-N and ma de available on video for purchase. DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHE MISTRY AND GENETICS Leaf development Dr. Neil A. McHale in collaboration with Dr. Ross E. Koning (Eastern CT State University) continued work on the molecular bi ology of leaf development, with technical assistance provided by Regan Huntley. The cu rrent emphasis is on a recently discovered group of small, mobile RNA molecules which regulate the expression of developmentally important genes at the post -transcriptional level. These microRNAs induce gene silencing in plants by guiding a ribonuc lease complex to specific target mRNA molecules, resulting in their cleavage and s ubsequent degradation. The expanding list of target mRNAs indicates that miRNAs regulate virtually all aspects of plant growth and development. The basic steps in biogenes is of miRNA molecules have been defined through analysis of mutant plants of Arab idopsis, but the mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of miRNA activ ity in plants remain unknown. We focused our work on the miRNA targeting HD-ZIPIII mRNAs (miR165/166), because they are critical regulators of leaf development in all higher plants. Our approach involves construction of GUSPLUS reporter transg enes artificially placed under miR165/166 regulation by insertion of the miRNA recognition site. Though this is normally expressed everywhere in the plant, the miR165/166 r ecognition site eliminates GUSPLUS mRNA in tissue where this miRNA is present and active. The data show that this miRNA is active throughout the spongy me sophyll of leaf blades, but not in the overlying vasculature or in upper palisade layer. Our ear lier studies on a MYB transcription factor (NsPHAN) indicated that this gene was also essential for palisade formation, raising the possibility that it performs this function through regulation of mi R165/166 activity. To test this, we introduced our GUSPLUS repor ter into mutant plants lacking NsPHAN function, and confirmed that loss of NsPHAN leads directly to an aberrant expansion of miR165/166 activity into vascular tissue of the leaf midrib and into the palisade layer of the blade. This result points directly to miRNA as the molecular mechanism that allows leaf blades to develop into a living solar panel. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 101 Our most recent work suggests that NsPH AN is actually regulating the location of miRNA activity through the pl ant hormones gibberellin (GA) and auxin. Under normal circumstances, NsPHAN is promoting form ation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules that block auxin respons es in the upper layers of the leaf blade. In the absence of NsPHAN, auxin responses are triggered th roughout the blade, l eading to aberrant activity of miR165/166. We show that intr oduction of a constitutive transgene for GA oxidase substitutes completely for loss of NsPHAN, blocking auxin response in the vasculature and palisade, and eliminating th e aberrant activity of miR165/166. Plant physiologists have known for decades that GA an d auxin act as antagonistic regulators of plant development. It now appears that this is accomplished through their opposing influence on the activity of small regulatory RNAs. Photosynthetic Genes Richard Peterson and Neil Schultes with technical assistance from Carol Clark and Ada Vail continued research on mechanis ms that protect the photosynthetic light harvesting in plant leaves. The 22- kiloDalton product of the nuclear psbS gene is essential for thermal dissipation of excess absorbed quanta, often referred to as nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (NPQ). Amino acid sequence data for 62 psbS proteins from 44 species were compiled using cDNA and expressed sequence tag nucleotide sequences in internet databanks. A phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences reveal ed topologies resembling those seen in phylogenetic trees constructed based on conventional taxonomic criteria. This indicates that amino acid substitutions (w hether neutral or adaptive) occurred over the course of biological evolution in parall el with appearance of new taxa. Alignment analysis indicates, however, that nume rous regions of psbS are high ly conserved consistent with their involvement in intrinsic aspects of the NPQ mechanism. Two such regions resemble a known chlorophyll-binding motif in the photosystem II light-harvesting proteins LHCII and CP29. Site-directed mu tagenesis was employed to block possible ion-bonding to two chlorophyll molecules by replacing putative glutamate and arginine ligands thaliana . The capacity to form NPQ was severely restricted in leaves from Arabidopsis lacking psbS due to deletion of the gene and in transforma nts of this deletion line that produced either of the mutant forms of psbS described. The results are consistent with, but do not prove, that chlorophylls bound to psbS pa rticipate in the NPQ mechanism. Despite success in use of transgenic Arabidopsis lines to test functional hypotheses regarding the mechanism of NPQ, creating such lines is laborious and time- consuming. The implication is that a suitable pace of future progress in discovering psbS functional domains will entail a more empiri cal approach involving analysis of large numbers of structural vari ants; a strategy incompatible with use of Arabidopsis transgenics. To address th is challenge, we have de veloped a novel high throughput system for analysis of psbS structural variants in Nicotiana benthamiana . Three important attributes of the N. benthamiana system have already been established. First, virus-induced gene silencing efficien tly suppressed expression of endogenous N. benthamiana psbS to create a de facto deletion phenocopy. Secondly, Agrobacterium- mediated transient expression of native (eg. N. benthamiana ) or orthologous Arabidopsis 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 psbS resulted in accumulation of psbS and co mplementation of NPQ-deficiency in pre- silenced N. benthamiana leaves. Thirdly, effects of st ructural dissimilarities on the capacity to generate NPQ are isolated (eg. free of psbS and zeaxanthin concentration effects) based on a simple mathematical m odel. Ongoing efforts will exploit existing structural diversity by compar ing NPQ capacities for distinct psbS proteins (orthologs) from species selected from a database of 65 verified sequences. The second phase will involve testing of doma in-swap chimeras of N. benthamiana/Zea mays psbS to test the functional significance of psbS regions showing adaptive evolution identified by in silico analysis. Plant Metabolism Dr. Neil Schultes with technical as sistance from Regan Huntley and in collaboration with Dr. George Mourad at the Department of Biology at the University of Indiana/Purdue at Fort Wayne Indiana, continued resear ch on mechanisms regulating transport of purines and pyrimidines in plants. Plant metabolites are in a constant state of flux, moving from cell to cell and between subcellular compartments. Membrane bound transporters act as metabolite-specific gate keepers that regulate their movement. These transporters are often key cont rol points in plant biochemist ry. Therefore, understanding how plant transporters functi on is an important goal for eventual enhancement of crop productivity. At least six different families of transporters (containing some forty-two members) are involved in the movement of nucleobases. Our rese arch investigates transporters in the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) family and recently identified genes in the adenine/gua nine-like transporter ( AtAzgA ) and purine addition, we investigate the FOR1 locus in Arabidopsis that is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of uracil transport. NAT proteins transport purines, pyrimidine s or vitamin C and are present in most living organisms. A large number of processe s utilize nucleobases or ascorbate in plants including house-keeping f unctions, secondary metabolite synthesis, plant/pathogen interactions, oxygen radical bioc hemistry and carbon or nitrog en storage and transport. In particular, purine metabolism and transpor t is central for urei de production. Ureides are the major nitrogen transport molecule in tropical N2-fixing legumes such as soybeans. The Arabidopsis genome contains twelve NAT loci. We hypothesize that NAT proteins have distinct but overlapping so lute transport specificities and that NAT loci have unique expression patterns. Such function/expression combinations often address sink-source relationships throughout th e plant as has been shown for multi-gene sugar and amino acid transporter family member s. Our long-term research goals aim at determining the expression patte rn and function of plant NAT genes and proteins. We routinely use four independent methods to m onitor gene expression to ensure accurate spatial and temporal expressi on patterns. Superior spatial resolution is ach ieved through analysis of transgenic Arabi dopsis harboring NAT promoter- -glucuronidase (GUS) fusions. Northern blot and RT/PCR were used to monitor endogenous NAT gene expression in different tissues and stag es of plant development. In addition in situ hybridization analysis was employed to monito r tissue-specific expression of NAT genes and verify the spatial expression patterns obs erved with transgenic reporter plants. We have gene expression data for ten of the 12 NAT loci. Our results confirm that each NAT The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 103 locus has a unique expression pattern. These patterns support the hypothesis that NAT proteins move nitrogenous compounds thr oughout the plant to serve the needs of developing \"sink\" tissues such as pollen, eggs and seed. The expression profiles display a preference for vascular localization and expr ession in 'sink' tissues (e.g. flowers). We have initiated experiments to use real-time PCR methods to quantitate the expression of NAT genes using the Cepheid Smart cycler sy stem with Dr. Charles Vossbrink in the Dept. of Soils and Water. We identified two Arabidopsis loci (At3g10960 and At5g50300) that encode for proteins very similar to the adenine-guanine transporter in Aspergillus nidulans AzgA. on 8-azaguanine (8-azg) containing media. We are employing both reverse and forward gene tic approaches in our investigations to determine if Arabidopsis has similar guanine transporters - designated as AtAzgA . In collaboration with Dr. Mourad EMS-induced Arabidopsis mutants ( azr1 and azr2) that show enhanced resistance to growth on 8-azg. During the past year we amplified and sequenced genomic sequences from these mutant lines that correspond to the transporter loci (At 3g10960 and At5g50300) and ained wild type seque nce, indicating that azr1 & 2 correspond to other loci . Further mapping studies are underway to link the molecular genotype with the genetic phenotype. In a reverse genetic approach, we have obtained independent T-DNA insertion mutant Arabidopsis lines in loci At3g10960 and At5g50300. We have generated homozygous lin es and are verifying the molecular genotypes. These lines will be used to test for enhanced resistance to growth on 8-azg containing media. In addition, we have placed the full-length cDNAs from both At3g10960 and At5g50300 into yeast expression v ectors and will test their ability in yeast heterologous systems fo r resistance to 8-azg. Amino acid alignment of the protei n encoded by Arabidopsis locus At5g03555 reveals substantial in the Nucleobase symporter 1 family and to the purine related transporter family (PRT) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Transporters in these families are responsible for the movement of uracil, uridine, allantoin, thiami ne or cytosine. Our experiments investigate if the At5g03555 protein fulfills any of these role s. We will test the function of the locus through growth of insertion mutant lines on toxin analogs 5-fluoroor otic acid, 5-bromo- deoxyunidine, pyrithiamine. In addition, we will test the ability of the A5g503555 gene to restore sensitivity to these toxic analogues once expressed in yeast deficient for the fur4, fui1, thi7 and fcy2 loci. In preparation for these experiments, we have obtained two insertion mutant lines in this locus - ET8162 from the Cold Spring Harbor Mutant collection and WiscDsLox419C03 from the Wi sconson T-DNA insertion collection. Our molecular analysis reveals that the ET8162 line has lost the insertion into At5g03555 and can no longer be used in mutant analys is. Homozygous WiscDsLox419C03 insertion lines have been propagated for the growth studies. In addition, we have cloned the coding region of the at5g03555 locus into tw o yeast transcription vectors to producing plasmid pNS399 and pRH124 for hetero logous complementation studies. 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 We have an active collaboration with Dr . George Mourad in the Biology Dept. at the University of Indiana/Purdue at Fort Wayne Indiana. He has isolated and characterized a mutant arabidopsis line - called for1- that is resistant to higher concentrations of 5-fluoroorot ic acid (5FOA). 5FOA is a toxic analogue of uracil. for1/for1 plants take up of uracil at approxima tely only 25% the rate or wild type arabidopsis. This locus may represent a NAT gene or a gene th at regulates uracil transporter genes. Our collaboration aims to find the locus responsible for the for1 phenotype. During the past ye ar our collaboration result ed in the submission and acceptance of a manuscript entitled \" A fluorooro tic acid-resistant mutant of Arabidopsis defective in the uptake of uracil\" in the Journal of Experimental Botany. Genetic Engineering of Paenibacillus Organisms To provide insight into wa ys to improve the use of Paenibacillus popilliae as a biological control agent agains t harmful insects, Dr. Douglas W. Dingman, assisted part- time by Cindy Musante, has performed molecular biological investiga tions on this insect pathogen. Various molecular techniques and mol ecular properties of this bacterium were explored to obtain a bett er understanding of the overall characteristics of P. popilliae . Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) DNA fingerprinting has been performed on 54 strains of P. popilliae and Paenibacillus lentimorbus obtained from different insect hosts and ge ographical locations. RFLP wa s performed using complete bacterial genomes extracted from the various isolates and pulsed field gel electrophoresis to separate restriction frag ments for production of DNA finge rprints. Using computer software to compare fingerprints, a phylogenic tree of the two organisms was constructed. P. popilliae and P. lentimorbus isolates were clearly separated into two groupings. This work did not support or ne gate these organisms as being different species. Within the P. popilliae grouping, 2 phylogenic clusters were identified. Within the P. lentimorbus grouping, 3 phylogenic clusters were identified. This work was supported by other experiments to determ ine the 16S rRNA sequence for comparisons between different isolates. Geographic distribution of isol ates by phylogeny was observed. All isolates obtained in Connecticut belonged to either one P. popilliae or one P. lentimorbus cluster. All isolates obtained from commercial in secticides were grouped into the second P. popilliae cluster. This phylogenic group ing of milky di sease bacteria demonstrates a geographic distribution of thes e bacteria and suggests modifications to be made for use of these bacteria as commercial insecticides. DNA sequence analysis of the P. popilliae plasmid pBP68 has been completed. The complete DNA sequence of this plasmid has been aligned to another P. popilliae plasmid, pBP614, and shown to have extensiv e nucleotide identity. pBP68 appears to encode three proteins (i.e., rep, zot-like, and an unidentified protein) and does not appear to contribute to the overall physio logy of the bacterium. Th e rep protein is involved in plasmid replication and matches rep protein identified in plasmid pBP614. An 83% amino acid identity was observed between rep proteins. The zot-like protein was representative of only the am ino-terminal portion (possibly involved in phage assembly) of Zot (zonula occludens toxin). Zot is a pr otein having dual function of phage assembly and intestinal permeating action. This info rmation suggests that these plasmids are members in a family of rolling circle plasmids possibly originating from a bacteriophage. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 105 Interestingly, these two plasmids (i.e., pB P68 and pBP614) were obtained from bacterial strains isolated from locations geographi cally disperse (New Zealand and North America). This sequence information will he lp scientific inves tigations on plasmid DNA evolution. Attempts at using the sequence in formation to develop pBP68 into a shuttle vehicle for genetic exchange experiments have not been successful. Collaboration with Dr. Neil P. Schultes to develop genetic exchan ge and insertional mutagenesis procedures has not been successful. Several attemp ts at electroporation of a pBP68-Tn5 erythromycin fusion P. popilliae failed to produce transformants. Also, conjugative transfer of a v ector construct, containing T n916 ends and the origin of transfer, was unsuccessful. Evaluation of th ese negative results a nd redesign of vector constructs are continuing. Development of tools and protocols for genetic exchange and insertional mutagenesis in P. popilliae are essential before many of the more powerful molecular techniques can be available for mo lecular investigations on this bacterium. DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY The Department of Entomology is involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Insect Inquiry Office. Staff in this office answer insect-related questions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scie ntists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visi ts, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the inte grated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, and wood-boring insects. Staff members also work closely with organic farmers and landscapers in Connecticut. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General As sembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibilit y, in part, to ensure our nurse ry industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. According to the latest census by the National Agricultural Statistics Survey, the Connecticut Green Industry (i.e ., nursery, greenhouse, floricu lture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Connec ticut with a market value of $246 million in 2002. An economic survey by the New England Nu rsery Association indicated that sales by the Connecticut Green Industry surpasse d $1.1 billion in 2005. In conjunction with regulatory activities, Department staff conducts a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests like the gypsy moth and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that repres ent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for pl ant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agricultur e through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. One example is the surveillance for Ramorum blight, a fungus-like pathogen that can affect many plants, but that can be particularly devastating to oaks. The regulatory and plant survey staff in Entomology collects samples, which are tested by cu lture and molecular techniques in a new 106 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 laboratory set up for DNA analysis in the De partment of Plant Pathology and Ecology with funding support from the Governor and Connecticut General Assembly. The staff of the Department of Entomo logy also takes the lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experi ment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Sta tion's research at publ ic events including agricultural fairs like the Eastern States Exposition (Big E), th e Connecticut Public Television Family Science Expo, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. Honey bees continue to be a popular exhi bit at these events. Department staff members also produce fact sheets and othe r various publications for the citizens of Connecticut. Three pesticide guides toward in tegrated pest management were produced for Connecticut arborists, nurseries, and Chri stmas tree growers. The guide for Christmas tree growers was individually mailed to 290 members of the Christmas Tree Growers Association. In the past two years, ne arly 10,000 copies of the Tick Management Handbook have been distributed through northea stern states, most of which went to Connecticut residents as well as Connecticut municipal and regional health departments, physicians and hospitals, and C onnecticut Cooperative Extension. Service, research, regulatory, and pest surv eillance activities are detailed in the following sections. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Insect Inquiry Office : Kenneth Welch, Gale Ridge, and Rose Bonito assisted by Alyson Florek and Michelle Guidone answer ed questions from the public. The insect inquiry office, in its more or less current form, has provided services for around 40 years. However, our insect identification services date to the early years of this institution and its mission. Starting with the first Annual Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station for 1877, the Station announced, among other things, that it was prepared to \"identify useful or injurious insects... and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultura l Science for the use and a dvantage of the citizens of Connecticut\". The insect inquiry office served 4,109 people through the year and 693 different insect and spider species were identified. Ants, termites, bees, wasps, hemlock woolly adelgids, and pantry pests continue to be th e leading pests of concern. The office has also seen an increase in inquiries about human bedbugs. Ticks, primarily the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis , would rank up among the highest number of specimens submitted for identification (6,123 in 2005). While ticks are pr ocessed in a different laboratory at the Experiment Station, many specimens are subm itted through the insect inquiry office. With a display hive, Ira Kettle answers questions about honey bees at the CPTV Science Expo (photo by Rose Bonito). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 107 The office served private citizens, the pest control and real estate industries, nurseries, arborists, health departments a nd other medical professionals, museums, municipalities, libraries, stat e government, and the news media. Inquiries were made through 2,342 telephone calls (57% ), 1,233 visitors (30%), 53 4 mail submissions (13%), and other miscellaneous submissions. The office also supported the plant regulatory activities of the Office of the State Entomologi st and agricultural and forest pest surveys with assistance on identification of collected insects. Impact : Stakeholder concerns abou t a variety of insects, sp iders and other arthropods were addressed. Identifications were made to determine which of the various arthropods presented were considered pests. Proper id entification provided resi dents with a guideline as to which arthropods required control a nd reduced stakeholder concerns about the \"pest\". Information was given on chemical a nd non-chemical control measures. In some cases, applications of pesticides could be reduced or eliminated. Correct identification also provided an opportunity for intercepting poten tial new pests. Bird and Butterfly Garden : Jeffrey Fengler, Vicki Bomba- Lewandoski, and Kirby Stafford updated the informational flyer for the Experiment Station's Bird and Butterfly Garden at Lock wood Farm. Rose Bonito and Jeffrey Fengler displayed information about the species pres ent and provided identi fication tours on Plant Science Day. The garden is a collaborative project of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Maintenance and improve ments to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli, his staff, and ot her Station staff members with monthly care provided by members of the Spring Glen Garden Club. The garden is open to the public during regular business hours. Photographs by Jeffrey Fengler and Vickie Bomba- Lewandoski. Rose Bonito, Jeffrey Fengler, and Mi chael Thomas observed 19 species of butterflies, 2 species of moth, 16 species of birds, and 14 species of dragonflies in the garden on Plant Science Day August 3, 2005.

A total of 5,897 were tested for the presence of the causal agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi , by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique s, of which 1,613 (27.35%) were positive. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Community Program for the Prevention of Lyme Disease : The majority of Lyme disease cases (75%) are acquired in the re sidential landscape, primarily through the nymphal stage of the Ixodes scapularis . The blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (commonly known as the deer tick) is the vector for the Lyme disease spirochete ( Borrelia burgdorferi Anaplasma phagocytophilum ). Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 4 years, a community-base program is being conducted for the prevention of Lyme disease in the Torrington Area Health Distri ct (TAHD) and the Ledge Ligh t Health District (LLHD). Research elements continue in the West port Weston Health Di strict (WWHD), the location of the first national Lyme disease co mmunity project, which formally ended in September 2004. These local intervention proj ects are a cooperat ive effort of the Connecticut Department of Public Health (D PH), Dr. Kirby Stafford of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Sta tion, and the local health dist ricts. Dr. Stafford provides technical advice, site visits , and lectures on tick manage ment for the projects and supervises the tick management research elements of the program. In the TAHD, research efforts are focused in the towns of Canaa n, Cornwall, and Salisbury. In the LLHD, tick control studies have been focused in the community of Mumford Cove in Groton. In 2005, the research was conducted with the a ssistance of Heidi Stuber and J.P. Barsky, and summer research assistants Christina St oehr, Tricia Borgstrom, Gregory Dunford and Lindsley Colligan and included collecting data on tick abundance, determining the prevalence of infection in both the vect or and reservoir ho sts, and evaluating The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 109 interventions in the communities. The long- term evaluation of the mouse-targeted fipronil-based bait box in residential communitie s is an important aspect of the ongoing research in the targeted communities. Rodent-Targeted Tick Control: White-footed mice ( larval and nymphal I. scapularis and are the principal reservoir for the three tick-borne pathogens. The Eastern chipm unk is also an important host reservoir for the tick, the Lyme spirochete and B. microti . A fipronil-based rodent bait box system for treating white-footed mice and chipmunks to cont rol ticks, initially tested by scientists from the CDC in cooperation with the Connec ticut Agricultural Experiment Station on Mason's Island, Stonington, CT, is availa ble commercially. Fipronil is the active ingredient in some flea and tick control products for dogs and cats (Frontline\u00ae). The commercial version of the bait box (Maxforce \u00ae Tick Management System, Bayer Environmental Science, Montvale, NJ) continue d to be evaluated in conjunction with the Lyme disease community intervention pr ojects in the WWHD and TAHD. Working closely with the local health districts, Dr. St afford established trials of the fipronil bait box in 2001 in inland residential neighborhoods in Westport and Weston, and with J.P. Barsky's assistance in 2002, in Litchfield County in Salisbury, Canaan, and Cornwall. The commercial Maxforce TMS box was used at the same sites or neighborhoods from 2002-2006. In Westport and Weston in 2005, 72 home s in two neighborhoods received 1,732 boxes (34 in Weston and 38 in Westport). The number of treated homes was down slightly from 2004. The boxes were installed in two installations (one in May (n = 866) and one in July (n = 866) to target nymphs and larvae on the rodents, respectively. The same residences in the two untreated nei ghborhoods, one each in Weston and Westport, continue to serve as the control. Virtually all examined boxes were fully empty of bait so rodent usage of the boxes continues to be high. Unlike 2004, there was little difference in the prevalence of infestation with larvae betw een the control and ba it box sites, but the mean number of nymphal and larval ticks on the rodents was lower in the bait box treated sites than the control. In the WWHD, there was a decrease in the number of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs in the bait box treated sites in 2005 compared with the control, especially at the Westport site. In Westport, there was a decrease of 61.9% compared to the control and in the preliminary analysis, this was statistically significant (P = 0.021). In three towns of the Torrington Area H ealth District (TAHD), the mean number of nymphal and larval ticks on the rodents co ntinues to be lower in the bait box treated sites than the control. Placement of the Maxforce TMS was begun mid-season in July 2002 and has continued through 2006. In 2005, 63 homes received a total of 1,636 boxes, again in two installations (M ay, n = 824; July, n = 812). Th ere were 382 boxes placed at 15 homes in Canaan, 822 boxes placed at 30 ho mes in Cornwall, and 432 boxes placed at 18 homes in Salisbury. With the exception of 20 05, there has been a steady decline in the prevalence of infestation by larval ticks on rodents in the bait box sites (77.8% in 2002, 61.3% in 2003, 34.4% in 2004, and 56.0% in 2005) , while infestation levels in the control, again 2005 was higher, have been more consistent (45.5, 58.1, 51.4%, and 75.0% for 2002-2005, respectively). Unlike 2004, there was no statistical differe nce in the larval numbers on the rodents between the contro l and bait box sites in 2005, although numbers in the control were higher. In addition, there appeared to be no significant difference in 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 questing tick abundance between the control and tr eated sites in any of the three towns. In 2005, host feeding and host seeking tick abundan ce were higher than the previous couple of years. This reflected an observed incr ease in tick activity at a number of sample locations in Connecticut. There was a major change in the ba it box installations in 2006 with the requirement by the U.S. Environmental Protec tion Agency (EPA) that a metal shroud or cover be used for each bait box to prevent dama ge and access to the bait by squirrels. Due to the unanticipated increased costs of th e shrouds and some project budget cuts, the number of treated homes was reduced, focu sing on the homes where tick and rodent sampling had been conducted through the earlier course of this study. Entomopathogenic Fungi for Tick Control: Postdoctoral scientist Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on the survival and efficacy against I. scapularis of the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 with Dr. Stafford in 2004 and experimental trials continued through 2005 and 2006. The fungus is now being developed commercially in both an oil-based emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and eventually a granular formulation for the control of a variety of pests, includi ng the blacklegged tick under the label Tick-Ex\u00ae (Earth BioSciences, Inc., New Haven, CT). Th e purpose of these studies is to determine optimum dosage and length of viability under different conditions in the field. Previously, we had shown that spores survived for more than 1.5 months in fall and for more than 3 months in the summer. However, high mort ality in mealworm bioassays was observed only in woodlands for this length of time. Bioassay tests and germination tests began in June 2005 to determine fungal viability in the field under summer conditions when nymphal ticks are active. Laboratory experiments were conducted with both th e oil-based emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and granular formulations against adult and nymphal ticks to provide initial guidelines on efficacy of the material and on the rate to be tried for field applications. Three types of treatment me thods were conducted with the EC against I. scapularis - Dip test, Crawl test and Spray-Crawl Test with four different concentrations of M. anisopliae in replicated sets. In dip test, ticks were dipped into the different concentrations levels for 30 seconds. The crawl and spray crawl test represented increasing exposure to the fungus. Crawl a nd spray-crawl methods were used as representative of field exposures to residuals or a direct sp ray of the fungal spores. For crawl test, the ticks were allowed to craw l on filter paper treated with different concentrations for 3, 30 or 300 minutes. In sp ray-crawl test, ticks sp rayed with different concentrations and then allowed to crawl fo r 3, 30 and 300 minutes. In case of granular formulation, ticks were allowed to craw l for 3, 30 and 300 minutes for each rate of application. After treatment, ti cks were transferred into scr eened centrifuge vials and held for four weeks in a humidity chamber at 90% RH and 25 C. Ticks were examined weekly and mortality was recorded. With the highest concentrati on level of EC tested in crawl test with adults, 100% mortality was obtained within a Female Ixodes scapularis killed by the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in the laboratory. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 111 week after only 3 minutes of exposure to the fungus. The lowest concentration (2.6x105 cfu/cm2) that was used for the adult ticks wh en tested against nymphal ticks brought 72.3% percent mortality within a week with only 3 minute time exposure. When the same concentration was sprayed and the adults were allowed to crawl for 3 minutes, 100% mortality was observed after only two weeks. Th e result of the experi ments with granular formulation showed that it needs more developm ent and refinement to be effective for the same rates of application. These laboratory trials suggest that high mortality can be obtained with this strain of M. anisopliae at rates suitable for commercial formulation and application. With the receipt of M. anisopliae spores from Earth Bioscience in late April 2006, field applications with tw o concentrations of the spor es were made to woodland plots in May 2006. Other plots serve as controls. These and upcoming studies will provide information needed for the applic ation guidelines for commercialization of M. anisopliae as a tick biopesticide. A commercial product with M. anisopliae will provide the first practical biological alternative to broadcast insecticides for residential control of the blacklegged tick. Tick Abundance and Lyme Disease Incidence: In 2005, Dr. Stafford's staff (Heidi Stuber, Christina Stoehr, and Tricia Borgst rom) continued to m onitor populations of I. scapularis nymphs on the lawns and adjacent woods at several residences in Lyme, Old Lyme, and East Haddam, Connecticut, by drag ging the vegetation with a square meter cloth 'tick drag'. Ticks have been collected at these residences since 1989. Tick activity was up substantially for June and July in 2005 in these three communities (436.3 nymphs per hectare) compared with 97.1 nymphs per hectare in 2004, 66.2 nymphs per hectare in 2003 and 132.5 nymphs per hectare in 2002. Ev en though only 6.5% (of 261 tested) were infected with B. burgdorferi , the risk index based on the ab undance of inf ected ticks was 25.4 vs. values less than 20 for the past 5 y ears in this region. Th e incidence of Lyme disease continues to be related to tick activity. Twenty-seven cases of Lyme disease were reported in East Haddam, Lyme and Old Lyme in 2005, compared to 10 and 7 fo r 2004 and 2003, respectively. Statewide, the number of reported cases increased to 1,810 compared to only 1,348 cases in 2004 and 1,403 in 2003. Comparisons of long-term trends in tick activity and prevalence of infection with reported incidence of Lyme disease will permit a better understanding of the relationship between tick a bundance and disease incidence. Comparison of the entomological risk index (ERI) x 3 (abunda nce of infected ticks) for the towns of East Haddam, Lyme and Old Lyme with the reported incidence of Lyme disease per 100,000 population for a 12 town area around the Connecticut River, which includes the three sampled towns, 2003-2005.

Magnarelli, assisted by Tia Mastrone, collaborated with Dr. Kirby C. Stafford, III, Dr. Jacob W. IJdo (University of Iowa) and Dr. Erol Fikrig (Yale Univ ersity) on measuring serum an tibodies to whole-cell or recombinant antigens of the white-footed mice, rodent reservoirs for these pathogens in nature, and the developm ent of new tests called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Of the 414 mouse se ra analyzed, 310 (75%) had antibodies to whole-cell B. burgdorferi , whereas 157 (38%) were positiv e to a specific outer surface protein (VlsE) of this bacter ium. Antibodies were also present to the other two disease organisms. Positive mice in extreme northern Connecticut indicate further geographic expansion of these infections in the state. New research was conducted on the bacterial agent of tularemia ( Francisella tularensis ) in cats. Assisted by Tia Mastrone, Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, Dr. Steve Levy (Durham Veterinary Hospital), and Dr. Ray Koski of L2 Diagnostics (New Haven) used a microagglutination (MA) test and indirect fluorescent antibod y (IFA) staining methods to detect serum antibodies to F. tularensis . Blood samples were obtained from privately owned cats that had outdoor exposure in Conn ecticut and New York State. Of the 91 sera tested by MA, 11 (12%) contained antibodies to F. tularensis . IFA staining methods revealed 22 (24%) positives. There was good concordance in laborat ory results of both tests. Cats were exposed to F. tularensis or a closely related organism. With exposure to ticks, other biting arthropods, mice, and rabbits, cats are at risk for acquiring F. tularensis infections and can be an impor tant source of information on th e presence of this agent in nature. th e needles of spruces, causing mainly cosmetic injury that could affect their value as Christmas trees. In 1997, Dr. Maier discovered this Eurasian moth in Connectic ut\u2014the first North American record. In spring 2005, he sent pheromone traps to coopera tors in Canada and the United States to determine the distributio n of the exotic moth. Based on a dult captures in the traps, this invasive moth has a broad range in north eastern North America. Pheromone traps captured adults in Quebec, all New Engla nd states, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Mich igan; no moths were caught in western or southern states. In 2006, pheromone-tra pping will continue in northeastern North America. In Orange, Connecticut, the adult males of B. pinicolella were captured in pheromone traps between mid-June and late Ju ly 2005. This flight period was similar to the one detected in 2004. K nowledge of the distribution a nd flight times should assist foresters, landscapers, and Christmas tree grow ers in developing strategies to cope with this potential pest of spruces. Surveys for Exotic Insects : In a 2005, Dr. Maier and his assistants, Mathew Wohlstrom and Shalyn Zappulla, conducted a CAPS (Cooperative Agricultural Survey, USDA) survey to find infestations of th e highly destructive emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis , in Connecticut. In the midwestern st ates of Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois, this eastern Asian b eetle has killed about 10 million ash trees. The survey team The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 113 visually inspected 2,004 ash trees at 492 s ites in the 169 towns of Connecticut. Inspectors also examined sticky bands on gird led ash trees in seven counties to detect adults. Fortunately, the results in 2005 we re the same as in 2004: no ash trees had emerald ash borers. In a second CAPS survey, the same inspectors searched for the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys , in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties by jarring the branches of apple and crabapple tr ees. This eastern Asian stink bug has a very broad host range, and, thus, could become a pest of several major crops in Connecticut. In 2005, the stink bug was not detected at any of the 23 sites sampled. The brown marmorated stink bug, however, is established in nearby states, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In late summer 2006, another survey will be conducted in the southern counties of Connecticut. In 2005, Dr. Maier also confirmed the pr esence of an exotic leaf-cutter bee, Anthidium oblongatum , and a foreign checkered beetle, Thanasimus formicarius , in Connecticut. The latter, mainly a predator of bark beetles, might assist in controlling several pestiferous wood-boring beetle s were it to become established. Classical Biocontrol of Leaf miners in Apple Orchards: Dr. Maier, and his assistants, Tracy Zarillo and Morgan Lowry, detected the Palearctic encyrtid wasp, Holcothorax testaceipes , in a commercial orchard for the first time in 2005. In seven plantings of apple trees in Guilford orchar d, the parasite, first released nearby in 1988, killed between 1-19% of the exotic tentiform leafminers of the first generation. By the second leafminer generation, the parasitism rate had fallen to only 1% in the low-spray plantings. The next phase of this rese arch will concentrate on how to use H. testaceipes effectively to bolster biocontro l in other low-spray orchards. Impact : Governmental agencies urge the use of alternative (non-chemical) methods to reduce human exposure to pestic ides. Integrated pest manage ment, particularly through biological control, contributes significantl y toward accomplishing this objective. The long-term benefits of using effective parasitic wasps, such as the exot ic encyrtid released in Connecticut, to suppress pest iferous fruit pests are reduced pesticide contamination of the environment, decreased health risk to humans, and possibly financial gains for growers. Seasonal Abundance of Wood-boring Beetles : In a long-term study, Dr. Maier, Tracy Zarrillo, and Morgan Lowry, are investig ating the pattern of seasonal activity of wood-associated insects by captu ring them on sticky bands on girdled forest trees and in Lindgren funnel-traps baited with ethyl alcoho l and alpha-pinene. In 2005, they caught more than 100 species of beetles, wood-bori ng wasps, and their natural enemies on bands on girdled white ash, white pine, and Norway spruce trees or in funnel-traps hung in conifer plantations. At the principal research sites in Barkhamsted and Orange, they trapped enough adult beetles to determine the activity of at least 30 species, including 10 species of longhorned beetle s (Cerambycidae) and 5 speci es of checkered beetles (Cleridae). Understanding the activity period of adult checkered beetles may be useful in timing tree harvests to conserve these natu ral enemies of wood- boring beetles. 114 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Community Farming: In their efforts to preserve farmland and other open space, many towns and local land trusts have bought fa rmland in the last ten years in order to keep it from being developed. But, towns and land trusts often don't have the capacity to run farms themselves, and often the land is abandoned, and its usefulness as farmland is allowed to deteriorate, as fields are take n over by invasive species and other brush, and barns and other infrastructure are not main tained. Dr. Kimberly Stoner organized a meeting of local community groups across the state, concerned about the farmland owned by their own towns or land trusts. The or ganizing meeting in January 2006 drew 40 people from 17 organizations. Five of the organizations will work toge ther on a project, funded by a grant from the Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Comm unity Program to Dr. Kimberly Stoner. These community organizations will learn the principles of Holistic Management and apply Holistic Management to planning, maki ng decisions, and testing the results in managing their local farms. This training will begin in August of 2006. Swede Midge Survey: The swede midge, Contarina nasturtii (Kieffer), a pest of plants in the cabbage family in Europe a nd Southwest Asia, was discovered in Ontario, Canada in 2001. Subsequent research f ound that this exotic insect was already established in many areas of Ontario and Quebec, and surveys in the cabbage growing regions of western New York State found in 2004 and 2005 that the swede midge was present in 6 counties. In 2006, Dr. Stone r, assisted by Adam Scheinkman, began surveying for the swede midge using pheromone traps and visual surveys on eight farms in central and western Connecticut as part of the CAPS programs. Cedar Beetles: Dr. Claire Rutledge continue d her investigation of two aspects of C. rufipenne 's chemical ecology in collaborati on with Dr. Lawrence Hanks of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Jocelyn Millar of the University of California, Riverside and their students. Callidiellum rufipenne is native to eastern Asia and was discovered in live ar borvitae in Connecticut in 1998 by Gale Ridge, Carol Lemmon and Dr. Chris Maier. Th e borer has since established in the southern half of Connecticut. C. rufipenne is found most frequently on plants in the families Cupressaceae and Taxodiaceae. We confirmed that the bee tles follow the typical mating strategy of Cerambycidae; males recognize females by means of a contact pheromone in the female's epicuticle. The contact pheromone appears to be a ble nd of straight-chain hydrocarbons and branched hydrocarbons. We also discovered that male C. rufipenne produce a volatile compound. This compound is c onsistent in chemical structure with recently discovered aggregation pheromones pr oduced by males of two additi on, the pores, which release the volatile pheromone, and the glands wh ich produce it were identified, and were consistent in location and st ructure with those of the ot her two cerambycids. Based on field and laboratory studies, adult beetles are attracted by the male beetles while they are emitting the volatile pheromone, and by their hos t plants. Preliminary data suggest that female beetles respond more strongly to the male-produced volatiles and that the volatiles are active over a fairly short range. The ex act function of this volatile pheromone for C. rufipenne is still under inves tigation, but could potentially be exploited as a monitoring tool. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 115 Bronze Birch Borer : Dr. Rutledge examined the strategies by which the Bronze Birch Borer, Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, locates its hosts. The beetles require stressed living trees to deve lop, and thus frequently att ack birches in landscape and nursery settings. The beetles cause consider able aesthetic and financial damage to homeowner and nursery properties in Conn ecticut. Following results from summer 2004, which suggested that borers can discriminate between stressed and healthy trees, Dr. Rutledge has begun to sample and analyze the air surrounding h ealthy and stressed birches in cooperation with Dr. L. Hanks of the University of Illinois to attempt to isolate the attractive compounds. Soybean Aphid in Connecticut : The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumara, was first found in the United States in Wiscons in in the summer of 2000. Since that time, it has spread to 21 states, primarily in the upper Midwest, and 3 Canadian provinces. The predicted range of soybean aphid includes a ll of New England, but it had not yet been reported from Connecticut and Massachusetts. Dr. Rutledge surveyed two sites in each state during the summer of 2005: two sites were sampled throughout the growing season, Lockwood Farm, and an organic farm in Cromwell, CT. Aphid population dynamics were substantially different than t hose found in the Midwest during summer 2005, implying that soybean aphid populations ar e not linked to those in the Midwest. Mordellidae Attraction to Methyl Salicylate : In the summer of 2004, attempts to attract Bronze Birch Borer with methyl salicy late were unsuccessful. However, the traps were highly attractive to one sp ecies of tumbling flower beetle (Coleoptera: Mordellidae). Almost 300 individuals were collected ove r a 2-week period. The experiment was repeated in 2005, about half the number of indi viduals were collecte d. In both years, the peak captures were made at roughly 1500 Degree Days (July 14, 2004 and July 25 2006). The beetle was identified by Dr . J. Jackman of Texas A&M as Falsomordellistena bihamata (Melsheimer). Little is known about the ecology of the Mordellidae, and this is the first known report of mass trapping of mordellids. REGULATORY ACTIVITIES NURSERY INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION Three-hundred and twenty-nine nurseries we re certified to co nduct intra- and interstate business. Ther e were 846 nursery inspections during the growing season. Eight-thousand, seven-hundred and thirty-three ac res of nursery stock were examined as well as plants growing under 32,586,875-sq. ft. of greenhouse space. The majority of plants were grown in hoop houses (28,264,900 s q. ft.), followed by plastic greenhouses (2,801,143 sq. ft.) and glass gr eenhouses (1,519,000 sq. ft.). JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIFICATION We observed treatments of 425,015 plants at one nursery and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with states that quara ntine nursery stock from Connecticut because of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica . 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 One nursery, which met the containeri zed nursery stock accreditation program requirements of the United States Japane se Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 5,090 plants to other states in 2005. Five nurseries met other requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 2,935 plants to states that quara ntine plants from Connecticut. JAPANESE BEETLE CERTIF ICATION TO CANADA Seven Connecticut nurseries, which me t the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Pl an, shipped 40,655 plants out of state in 2005. NURSERY DEALER PERMITS Nursery dealer permits were issued to 173 firms. One-hundred and fifty of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 465 outlets. PHYTOSANTIARY CERTIFICATES Three-hundred and forty-eight phytosanitar y inspection cer tificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant ma terials to destinations outside the United States: Plants Number tree peonies (plants) 26 Greenhouse plants 1,140 Nursery stock (containers & plants) 33,189 Orchids (plants & flasks) 4,126 Perennials (plants in tissue culture) 65 (bare root plants) 8,350 (plants) 10,925 (flats) 157 Seeds (cartons) 4Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 151,482 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 117 SPECIAL INSPECTIONS 1.

Two tobacco growers had 151 acres inspected for the aerial applic ation of pesticides. 4. Fifteen post-entry inspections were carri ed out on 14,650 plants at 2 locations. At two sites, 2,584 plants were released from quarantine. APIARY CERTIFICATION Three-hundred beekeepers registered 1,974 colonies in 2005. Our bee inspector opened and inspected 676 colonies in areas known to have foulbrood disease. American foulbrood was found in 27 colonies. These colonies were destroyed. 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 County Colonies Opened & Inspected Varroa Mite Positive American Foulbrood Positive Nosema Formica Ants Wax Moth Windham 213 35 4 1 3 New London 94 5 2 New Haven 116 10 2 Hartford 122 96 7 Middlesex 21 5 6 4 Litchfield 53 25 5 Fairfield 33 5 1 Tolland 24 3 Totals 676 184 27 1 3 4 *Varroa mite totals represent infestations that were not controlled. These colonies were in the final stages of their existence. Varroa m ites are present in all colonies, treated or untreated. During 2005, 500 honey bees from 3 apiaries in the towns of Chester, Weston and Fairfield were examined in the laboratory for the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi . There were no positives for tracheal mites. FOREST HEALTH SURVEY During the summer of 2005, we examined 51 permanent, one-acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest hea lth in Connecticut. Th ese plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal wa ter company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long-term studies. We evaluate d signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branch es, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increas ing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to mon itor the forests over several years to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or ar e declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. INSECT AND PLANT DISEASE SURVEYS NURSERY INSECTS The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 119 The most abundant pests found in nurseri es were mites on various trees and shrubs, lacebug on Pieris and Rhododendron , aphids on various trees and shrubs, black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) on Taxus and Rhododendron leafminer on Rhododendron. SURVEYS FOR INSECT PESTS Surveys were conducted regionally and st atewide for native, established and exotic insect pests. No emerald ash borer s, Asian Longhorned beetles, or pine shoot beetles were found in 2005. Gypsy Moth: There was an outbreak of gypsy mo th activity in parts of eastern Connecticut in 2005, with defoliation of wh ite oaks and other trees, including some evergreens over an area of 64,273 acres (see ta ble). Our annual aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation, conducted starting in early July 2005 by Deputy State Entomologist, Dr. Victoria Smith, and State Plant Inspector , Peter Trenchard, covered 1.8 million acres of urban/suburban forest in all eight Connecticut counties. Gypsy moth caterpillars were abundant from Guilford to Waterford and a ppeared centered in the East Haddam area. Tree defoliation was most extensive in Middlesex County (32,985 acres), followed by New London County (19,062 acres). An estim ated 10,896 acres or 17% of the total defoliation was cons idered heavy (76-100% defoliation). Forest defoliation in acres by county from the gypsy moth in 2005 based on aerial survey. % Defoliation County 10-25 26-50 51-75 76-100 Total 8,969 10,896 64,273 In November and December, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80- 95% favorable host sites on a 7 -mile grid (102 sites) throughout Conn ecticut. At sixteen sites, egg masses were found in low numbers that may indicate a build up in population. At seven sites, egg masses were found in numbers large enough to be considered a problem for the spring and summer of 2006. Asian Longhorned Beetle: The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis , first discovered attack ing trees in August of 1996 in New York, has spread in Queens, New York to within 25 miles of Greenwich in southwestern Connecticut. There is risk for beetle entry in ports because of the transportation of solid wood packing material on ships coming from areas of the world where this beetle is found. 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 We, therefore, concentrated additional survey efforts in Connecticut in the areas of Bridgeport, Groton, New Haven and New London as well as their surrounding parks that contain a high percentage of maple, a favorite food source of the Asian longhorned beetle. All surveys and identifications, thus far, were negative. Asian Longhorned Beetle Survey, 2005. County # Inspections # Trees Inspected # Infested Trees Fairfield 9 1,301 0 New Haven 13 850 0 New London 5 975 0 Totals 27 3,126 0 Orange-Striped Oakworm: The Orange-striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria , is a native moth that ranges from eastern Canada s outhward to Georgia. It is a common pest of oak species in Connecticut. Occasionally, local infestations occur when oaks have been stressed by other factors such as drought or gypsy moths. Serious defoliation can occur when this happens. The moths lay up to 500 eggs on the unders ides of oak leaves in early summer and are attracted to artificial light. The caterpillars feed on the foliage, and then they burrow into the soil and build an earthen cell, where it pupates and passes the winter. On September 27 & 28, 2005, a st atewide aerial survey was conducted for orange-stripped oakworm defoliation. Defolia tion was found in five towns (3,631 acres) in Windham County and in two towns in New London County (131 acres). Total acres defoliated were 3,762. Pine Shoot Beetle: One-hundred and twenty-three Christmas tree farms in 56 Connecticut towns were inspect ed for pine shoot beetles, Tomicus piniperda , during 2005. The inspections encompassed 1,399 acres of trees and the individual examinations of 76,781 Christmas trees. The trees were examined by walking along the rows looking for damage. Pine shoot beetle s were not found in Connecticut. In late November and December, we examined 38,654 Christmas trees owned by 114 dealers in 58 towns. The trees were in spected for over-winteri ng pine shoot beetle adults in the base of tree trunks or beetle damage. We were especially concerned about Christmas trees that were shipped in to Connecticut from states with Tomicus piniperda infestations. Pine shoot beetle s were not found in Connecticut. During March, 2005, Lindgren Funnel traps were set up for Pine shoot beetle. Five traps were set up in each county and were monitored at two week intervals through mid-May. No adult pine shoot beetles were found. Smaller Japanese Cedar Longhorn Beetle: Based on surveying with trap-logs and on rearing insects from dead wood, the exotic small Japanese cedar longhorned beetle, Callidiellum rufipenne , is established in 58 Connecticut towns distributed in Fairfield, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 121 Hartford, Middlesex, New Haven, and New L ondon Counties. The beetle successfully developed on 9 species of ornamental and wild plants in the family Cupressaceae. In the wild, the principal host was dead eastern red cedar, but Callidiellum rufipenne also infested dead common juniper and Atlantic white cedar. In garden centers, the main hosts were stressed balled and burlaped arborvitae and other c upressaceous landscape plants. During 2005, we inspected 21,187 plants for Callidiellum rufipenne at 51 nurseries in 52 Connecticut towns. Nine infested plants were found. Warehouse Survey for Wood-Boring Insects: In early 2005, we conducted a trapping survey of 15 Connecticut warehouses in 5 counties to detect the possible presence of exotic wood-boring insects. Lindgren funnel traps, w ith a chemical lure, were placed in the warehouses and checked bi-weekly for insect activity. No exotic insects were found. Winter Moth: In November, 2005 wing traps were set up for Winter moth, Operophtera brumata , at 36 locations in eastern and cen tral Connecticut. The traps were checked once in mid-December and removed at the end of December. Winter moth was found at 2 locations in Stonington, Connecticut. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid: The hemlock woolly adelgid , Adelges tsugae , remains an important pest of hemlock in Connectic ut, spreading northward since its coastal detection in 1985 and infesting trees in a ll 169 towns in the state. During 2005, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woolly adelgid. Two nurse ries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our inspectors observed treatments and issued phytosanitary certificates to cover 1,135 plants in these shipments. SURVEYS FOR PLANT DISEASES Daylily Rust: A rust fungus ( Puccinia hemerocallidis) was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first tim e in the summer of 2000. It was found in Connecticut in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies ow ned by private citizens. It is now confirmed to occur in three counties. During 2005, we survey ed daylilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of this rust. One-hundred and eight inspections were carried out on 128,256 plants. No signs of Puccinia hemerocallidis were found. Ramorum Blight: Ramorum Leaf Blight (Sudden Oa k Death) is a serious plant disease that attacks many types of plants and trees common to Connecticut. It is currently known to occur in the Pacific No rthwest on oaks, azalea s, big leaf maples, Douglas fir, rhododendrons, and viburnum. It does not affect humans and is not a food safety concern. Sudden Oak Death is caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora ramorum . The pathogen is not a fungus or a bacterium, but a member of a unique group of organisms 122 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 called Oomycetes. Oomycetes share some char acteristics of fungi but are biologically different. Plant inspector Peter Trenchard (left) and Tia Mastrone, with plant inspector Stephen Sandrey (right) conduct surveys for Ramorum blight. As part of the National Nu rsery Survey, we examined plants for symptoms of Ramorum Leaf Blight. We insp ected plants in nurseries a nd garden centers and plants being shipped to other states and Canadian destinations. A total of 80 inspections were carried out on 15,859 plants on the host list were examined. No signs of Sudden Oak Death were found. A nursery/forest environmental survey was done in conjunction with the US Forest Service. The perimeter survey was done on three large whol esale nurseries, the three nurseries that had positives during the nursery trace forwards in 2004 and one woodland plot. Four one hundred meter tr ansects were measured using GPS along nursery perimeter. The starting and ending trees marked with GPS readings and tape. The woodland plot transects measured from one starting point tree. A ll host species along transects were examined for possible symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. No infected leaves or tree cankers were found. Chrysanthemum White Rust: During 2005, we continued to survey for Chrysanthemum white rust disease, caused by the fungus, Puccinia horiana . We inspected 1,147,018 chrysanthemums raised by 364 growers and dealers for the presence of chrysanthemum white rust. No chrysanthemum white rust was found. DEPARTMENT OF FOREST RY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including novel sp ecialty crops, and the effect of the growing deer population on natural and mana ged landscapes. Connecticut has a strong link to the forest. Approximately 60% of Connec ticut's land area is classified as forest. In addition to valuable non-commodity amenities (watershed protection, wildlife habitat, passive recreation), the forests are a valuable part of the local economy. Connecticut has a $500 million wood product industry of 350 firms that provide employment to 3,600 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 123 loggers, millworkers, and others. Both gypsy lowered the productivity of our forests. Gypsy moth defoliations can reduce growth and survival of trees, while deer alter the composition and density of forest regeneration. Gypsy moth defoliation and oak mortality : Gypsy moths have spread to at least seventeen eastern states since its accide ntal introduction outside of Bo ston in the late 1800's and is well established on the eastern and northern portions of the ce ntral hardwood region. Although gypsy moth has a wide host range, incr eased mortality and reduced growth of oak ( Quercus ) species have accounted for most of the economic and ecological damage caused by this alien pest. The Old-Series pl ots, established in 1926-27, provided a unique opportunity to document the effect of mu lti-year defoliations on oak mortality and diameter growth, analyze how mortality was influenced by crown and vigor classes, and examine the longer term impacts (20+ years) of multi-year defoliations on mortality and growth of upland oaks. Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward remeasured these plots in 1997. Crown class and diameter of 4,088 upland oaks have been monitored at 10-yr inte rvals on these plots. During the thirty-years before defoliation, mortality rates for upper canopy trees (dominant and codominant crown classes) were lower than mortality ra tes for lower canopy trees (intermediate and suppressed). Mortality rates for upper canopy tr ees did not differ between the white and red oak groups. Among upper canopy trees, diameter growth of red oaks (0.17 inches/year) was significantly greater than for white oaks (0.12 inches/year). Plots had three episodes of moderate to heavy defoliation: 1961-1964, 1971-1972, and 1981. Primary consecutive ye ars of moderate to heavy defoliation, 1961-1963, were the first known defoliation episodes on these plots. Mortality rates increased signi ficantly during this period for both the red oak and white oak groups, and for all crown classes. Mo rtality of upper canopy white oaks was significantly higher than fo r upper canopy red oaks. Mortality of upper canopy red oaks remained higher than pre-defoliation levels during 1967-77 when there were two consecutive years of defoliation. Mortality of upper canopy white oaks decreased to values similar to, and not significantly different from, pre-defoliation values. Diameter growth of upper canopy red oaks, but not white oaks, decreased during the initial period of defoliation. Surprisingly, multi-year defoliations did not have a significant impact on diameter growth of lower canopy trees. This may be because mortality was higher for the sl owest growing trees. For red oa ks, but not white oaks, tree vigor was a good predictor of upper canopy tree mortality between 1957-1967. Red oaks with annual diameter growth of at least 0.1 inches had lower mort ality rates during the period of multi-year defoliations than slower growing trees. For example, mortality was 16 percent for codominant red oaks that ha d annual diameter growth of 0.15 inches compared with 60 percent for codominant red oaks that had annual diameter growth of less than 0.05. Since the end of the multi-y ear defoliations in 1972, mortality rates for both species groups and all crown classes have fallen to pre-defoliation levels. Diameter growth 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 quickly recovered following the end of multi-year defoliations. Diameter growth of codominant red and white oaks during 1987-1997 we re similar to, or higher than, growth before 1957-1967. The longer term impacts of multi -year defoliations have been to nearly eliminate lower canopy oaks (both red and wh ite oaks) and to reduce the proportion of white oaks relative to red oaks. Because mo rtality of upper canopy red oaks was less than that of white oaks, and because the diameter growth of surviving red oaks increased once defoliations ceased, total oak basal area is now higher than before the period of multi- year defoliations. Reducing browse damage in forest plantations : Maintenance or enhancement of a conifer component is an integral part of maintain ing habitat diversity, especially in areas dominated by deciduous species. Loss of eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis Adelges tsugae ) has reduced the conifer component from New England through the sout hern Appalachians. Ot her conifer species in the northeastern United States are potenti ally threatened by introduced pests including a siricid woodwasp ( Sirex buoliana ). Replacement of conifers lost to introduced pests, or maintenance of extant conifer populations, can be problematic in areas with large deer herds. Severe browse damage by deer has been reported in eastern and wester n United States, Europe, and Asia. In many areas, especially natural areas and parks where hunting in prohibited, the presence of large deer herds precludes successful regeneration unless seedlings are protected. In response to the loss of red pine ( Pinus resinosa ) initiated by red in Connecticut , Drs. Jeffrey S. Ward and George R. Stephens began a series of experiments in 1989 to develop a practical system of growing white pi ne in areas with large deer herds. Growth and survival was monitored on these plots through 2005. The first study, in collaboration with Dr. Martin P.N. Gent , found tree shelters di d not increase height growth of eastern white pine, but did increase survival. However, tree shelte rs were both expensive to install and maintain. In 1991, a study site was established in Natchaug State Forest to examine the potential of bud caps. The study was further expanded in 1994-95 with plots in Voluntown, Chaplin, Middletown, and Ashford to determine if the system of rigid mesh tube and buds caps developed in the western Unite d States could be successfully used to increase survival and height growth of eastern white pine in southern New England. These studies found that the combination of rigid mesh tubes and bud caps could reduce terminal bud damage, and quite unexpectedly, the inci dence of white pine weevil ( Pissodes strobi ) damage. A site visit at Natchaug study site during mid-June the summer after bud caps were installed found distorted top growth on so me seedlings. This distortion was caused by terminal buds snagging on the bud caps. A clos er inspection revealed that terminal buds that were at least 0.5 cm higher than the bud cap were not distorte d. Thereafter, all bud caps were adjusted to be slightly below th e height of the terminal bud. No subsequent terminal bud distortions were observed. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 125 We observed one problem with the rigid me sh tubes that was not reported in earlier studies. The taller (91 cm) t ubes frequently folded over following a heavy wet snowfall that is typical of southern New England. This required the tube to be straightened before bud expansion to avoid distorted growth of th e terminal. Later experiments used a shorter (60 cm tall) tube and this problem was eliminated. Although shelterwood prescriptions have been suggested as one method of naturally regenerating eastern white pine , underplanted seedlings generally grow slower than those planted in open clearcuts. Af ter nine years, underplanted se edlings were the same height as open-grown seedlings after three years, a nd were still short enough to be vulnerable to browse damage. These results suggest that unde rplanting could be a successful strategy to establish pine seedlings in hardwood stands , but complete oversto ry removal will be necessary after several years if the pines are to grow and form part of a future upper canopy. In 1997, Drs. Jeffrey S. Ward and Todd L. Mervosh (Valley Lab) began a study to examine the interaction of browse control and competition control on eastern white pine survival and growth. Protecting seedlings from deer browse may not ensure a successful planting on sites with vigorous weeds and br ush. The vegetation control component used a combination of herbicide application and mowing. Plantings were established in four locatio ns: Gaillard, Pachaug, and Norfolk. Each study site had two replic ations. Each replication had 20 seedlings for each of the following treatments: vegetation control/brow se protection, vegetati on control/browse pr otection, no vegetation control/no browse protection. The final experiment indicates that the decision to use vegetation control will depend on the anticipated degree of browse damage. Br owse damage was higher and survival lower on the vegetation control plots at Gaillard wher e deer densities were much higher than the other study areas. The seedlings at Gaillard were much smaller than the surrounding vegetation (primarily grasses and Solidago ). Thus, in areas with large deer herds, the benefits of reducing competition from surroundi ng vegetation may be more than offset by the increased probability of repeated severe browse damage to seedlings not hidden by taller plants. Where significant browse damage can be e xpected, browse protection can increase survival and height growth. Only two of ei ghty seedlings survived seven years without browse protection at Gaillard ; and these seedlings were onl y 35 cm tall. This study found a weak correlation between browse protec tion and height growth at Gaillard. Vegetation control may be appropriate for areas with lower deer densities. Both survival and height growth were increased by vegetati on control where deer densities were lower. Competing vegetation can limit photosyntheticall y active radiation av ailable to smaller seedlings, thus influencing both survival and growth. Deer Browse Exclosure Study : Each year, more and more Nutmeggers have the opportunity to watch deer in their own b ackyard and gardens. Unfortunately, this increasingly common sight has a cost. Many a gardener knows the frustration of waking 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 up to find prized roses, perennial plant be ds, or vegetable gardens damaged by deer browse. In 2001, it was estimated that deer nationwide were the cause of $407 million in losses to field crops, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Deer damage is not limited to plants. Deer are a host species for the ticks that tr ansmit Lyme disease. C onnecticut also reports approximately 3,300 vehicle collisions with deer annually, but the Department of Environmental Protection estimates the tota l number to be closer to 10,000 due to unreported collisions. Nationwide, an estimated 1.5 million vehicle collisions with deer occur annually and result in approximate ly $1.1 billion in damages, 29,000 human injuries, and 200 human fatalities. Severe browsing by large deer herds has seri ously impaired natural regeneration on some Connecticut forests. Forest understories ha ve become dominated by browse resistant species such as hophornbeam, blue beech, and striped maple along with exotic invasives such as Japanese barberry, ailanthus, or iental bittersweet, and winged euonymus. Unfortunately, these browse resistant specie s often have lower economic, aesthetic, and wildlife values than the speci es they displace. The dama ge caused by browsing is not limited to trees. At least 98 threatened or e ndangered plants are browsed by white-tailed deer. Many spring wildflowers (lilies, trilli ums, orchids, lobelia s, and buttercups) and flowering shrubs (dogwoods, viburnums, rose s, and rhododendrons) are favored by deer. Change in forest structure caused by deer browse can have a ne gative impact on bird species that nest in the understory. One method to study the impact of deer on natu ral ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vege tation protected from deer br owse to unprotected plots. Scott C. Williams and Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward collected vegetation da ta within and outside sixteen deer exclosures thr oughout the state. Deer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within. Growth ra tes and species diversity of enclosed vegetation were compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation. The project is a collaborative effort with The Nature Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclosures, f our each at Burnham Brook Pres erve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement also in East Haddam, a nd Devil's Den Preserve in Weston. We are also including four of our ow n exclosures on South Centra l Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Pre liminary data analysis from the fall 2005 sampling period indicates that seedling density within the exclosures is greater than control plots. Vegetation was taller within exclosures. Herbaceous vegetation sampling will be completed by the end of summer in 2006. All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in the fall. Re sults from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of deer . Land managers can use this information to strategize an appr opriate deer management plan. White-tailed Deer as Seed Dispersers in Connecticut : Scott C. Williams and Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward are completing the fourth and final y ear worth of data collection looking at white-tailed deer as seed dispersers. A total of 514 deer pellet groups have been collected over four years (2002-2005) in the towns of Guilford, North Branford, Cheshire, and Norfolk. Entire pellet groups were collected and placed in individual sampling bags and vernalized at 5\u00b0C for 60 days. After 60 days , pellet groups were removed and placed on and lightly covered with a growing medium. Pl anted samples were kept in a temperature The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 127 controlled greenhouse at 24\u00baC. Samples were wa tered as needed, fert ilized to encourage flowering for identification purposes, and re mained in the greenhouse for approximately 6 months. Germinants were allowed to grow unt il they could be identified, at which time, they were removed from the tray and discarded. Thus far, a total of 11,044 seedlings of 77 positively identified species have germinated. The majority of species (60%) and seedlings (approx. 85%) are not of native origin to the state of Connecticut. Such species include sp.), as well as others. We determined deer on site had the potential to di sperse approximately 2,000 exotic seeds per mile2 per day throughout summer and autumn. It has been estimated that exotic plants are taking over 1.73 million acres of forest and wildlife habitat annually and white-tailed deer are contributing to this i nvasion. As white-tailed deer numbers in Connecticut continue to grow, so will the number of exotic seeds dispersed into woodland settings, choking out native species and further altering forested ecosystems. Exotic plants are usually of little economic value and have a competitive advantage over valuable native species. Exotic plants are a serious economic threat to our renewable natural resources such as timber, game species, and non-game wildlife. Before steps can be taken to slow the spread of exo tic species, all potential dispersal agents need to be identified. Analysis of Deer/Vehicle Collisions : There are approximately 3,000 reported deer/vehicle collisions annually in Connecticut. Howe ver, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection estimates that approximately 18,000 occur annually. Human injuries and death do occur each year from deer /vehicle collisions in Connecticut. It has been estimated that damage to each vehicle involved in a deer collision costs about $2,500, or an estimated $45,000,000 annually in vehicle repairs alone. Scott C. Williams is continuing a project to analysis spatial patterns deer/vehicle collision. Currently, the 2003 Deer Kill Incident Report data are being entered into a database. This information will be added to statewide data for 2000, 2001, and 2002 which was entered in previous years. Location of accidents is described on reports. Latitude and longitude coordinates are then obtained using DeLorme Street Atlas USA. Analysis of data thus far indicates similar findings to other studi es. Collisions are most lik ely to happen in October, November, and December. Collisions often occur during morning and evening hours, corresponding to peak traffic and animal activity . We are in the process of establishing a partnership with the Connecticut Department of Transportation to research the behaviors of white-tailed deer around Connecticut highways. By bette r understanding how roadways affect deer usage of the surrounding habitat, we may be ab le to better predict areas with high collision potential . If such spots are identified, the public can be alerted to these areas during peak hours and numerous collisions could be avoided, decreasing risk to Connecticut residents and saving milli ons of dollars in vehicle repairs. 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Survey of deer damage in Connecticut : Damage caused by white-tailed deer is not limited to forest regeneration and deer-vehicle col lisions. Anecdotal reports of extensive deer damage to agricultural crops in Connecticut are common, but not well documented. In 2003-2004, surveys were distributed to members of the Connecticut Farm Bureau, Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Associat ion, and the Connecticut Pomological Society. Growers were requested to report on ac tual crop damage from different wildlife species (including deer), per cent of that crop lost, percen t of that crop damaged by each species of animal, monetary loss due to each damaged crop, and measures taken to avert animal damage. A total of 137 surveys were returned from growers in 83 towns. On average, respondents had owned or managed their land for 31 year s. These farms, orchards, and nurseries included over 6,000 acres of the nearly 100,000 acres of working landscape in Connecticut. The surveys indicated wildlife damage on nearly 40% of the acreage. A wide variety of crops was reported to be damaged by deer including Christmas and fruit trees, pumpkins, berries, nursery plants , vegetables, grapes, and hay fields. As a part of the survey, growers reported th e monetary losses related to wildlife damage. Respondents indicated a total of $70,000 in w ildlife damage to Christmas tree crops, $42,000 in damages to fruit trees, $15,000 to vegetable crops, and $8,000 in other crops. These totals would undoubtedly be larger if all farms in Connecticut were surveyed. Economic losses were not limited to direct dama ge of crops, but also to indirect damages from profitable crops that could not be gr own. Forty growers had stopped using at least one field, or had stopped gr owing a crop, because of damage. Christmas trees and pumpkins were the crops most commonly discontinued. Thirty-four percent of growers reported increased wildlife damage in the past five years. Growers with increased damage spent an average of $710 to reduce damage during 2002. Growers have employed a variety of methods to reduce browse damage . Crop damage permits and fencing were the only methods that were reported to be generally effective at least half of the time. Repellents were reported to be the l east effective method. Deer Repellent Study : Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward and Scott C. Williams began a deer repellent trial at two different sites within Connect icut in spring 2006. Deer repellents are most often strong and/or foul-smelling agents that are applied directly to plants in an attempt to prevent deer from browsing and ultimately damaging them. Repellents work in different ways: some make the animal sick, others ta ste very hot or bitter, while others are supposed to invoke fear. Ten different repelle nt formulations are being tested: Chew Nott\u00ae, Deer Solution\u00ae, Hinder\u00ae, Repellex\u00ae systemic tablets, and coyote urine. Other repellent trials have been completed, but none as extens ive with such a varied array of repellent types. At both sites, Windsor and Woodbridge, 144 yews ( Taxus ) and 144 hostas ( planted. Twelve hostas and twelve ye ws at each site receive one of twelve treatments (the ten different repellents, a fence, and untreated control). Manufacture's instructions for repellent application are being followed. Results from this study will inform Connecticut residents about the most effective repellent for use on these two browse susceptible species. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 129 Effect of shade quality of greenhouse tomato : Farmers produce tomatoes in greenhouses to capitalize on the demand by consumers for fresh and native vegetables with improved taste and nutritive qualities. Typically plan ts are started in sp ring, but much of the production occurs during the hot test months of summer. Dr. Martin P.N. Gent concluded three years of experiments in 2005 to compare the yield and quality of various cultivars of tomatoes grown in greenhouses th at were cooled by cove ring with reflective aluminized shade cloth. Houses were compared that either had no shade, or a shade cloth that reduced light transmission into the greenhouse by 15%, 30% or 50%, compared to greenhouses only covered with the usual double- layer of clear polyethylene film. These treatments are referred to as 0, 15%, 30% or 50% shade, respectively. The shade was applied in early June, corresponding to the st art of fruit production, and the start of the first warm weather. The houses remained shaded for the rest of the summer, and fruit was picked into August. The tomato plants were grown from seeds germinated in January, and the seedlings were transplant ed into the greenhouses in March. Within each of the years 2003 to 2005, yields were compared among greenhouses with different degrees of shade. Shade reduced total yield significantly in each year. Total yield with 50% shade was 16.4, 17.5 and 18.5 lbs/plant, compared to 21.8, 20.4 and 20.7 lbs/plant with no shade, in 2003, 2004 and 2005, re spectively. Thus, to tal yield with 50% shade was 24, 14 and 11% less than that with no shade in these years. However, shade did not decrease marketable yield significantl y in any year. The marketable yield with 50% shade was 11.5, 9.5, and 9.7 lbs/plant, comp ared to 11.5, 9.5, and 10.1 lbs/plant with no shade, in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. T hus, marketable yield with 50% shade was only 10% less than that with no shade in 2003, the same as that with no shade in 2004, and only 4% less than that with no shade in 2005. Compared to the number of fruit produced with 50% shade, 16, 14 and 14% more of the fruit was unmarketable when produced with no shade, in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The effect of shade on fruit size and the frac tion of fruit with various defects varied among the three years of the experiment. In pa rt, this was because two of the cultivars grown in 2003 differed from those grow n in 2004 and 2005. In 2003, Rapsodie had the largest fruit, 7.8 to 8.6 oz, while 'Buffalo' ha d the smallest, 6.2 to 6.7 oz. 'Buffalo' had the highest fraction of market able fruit overall, 57 to 69%, but the marketable fraction was least with 50% shade. 'Match' had the lowe st fraction of marketable fruit, 41 to 51%, and this fraction increased with shade. 'Buffa lo' had the fewest fruit with cracked skin, 21 to 29%, while 'Rapsodie' ha d the most, 28 to 42%. For all cultivars except 'Buffalo', plants grown with 50% shade produced the fe west fruit with cracks. The incidence of blossom end rot was lower in 2003 than in other years, because 'JetStar' was not included. Averaged over all cultivars, shade treatment reduced fruit si ze significantly only in 2003. Fruit size was 6.9 oz with 50% shade, compared to 7.4 oz with no shade. In 2004, fruit size differed by only 0.2 oz among all shading treatments. In 2005, the largest fruit was picked from greenhouse covered with 15 or 30% shade, 9.0 and 8.6 oz, respectively, compared to 8.4 oz from greenhouses with none or 50% shade. The treatments had little effect on fruit qua lity in 2004, except shade decreased total yield in proportion to the degree of shade. In 2005, a 15% shade resulted in the highest yield. The largest fruits were also produced with 15 or 30% shade. The decrease in the number 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 of fruit with cracks was proportional to the de gree of shade. The number of irregular fruit also varied with shade. All of these characteristics differe d between cultivars, and the effect of shade on fruit size, and fruit with cracked skin or irregular shape differed between cultivars. The cultivars differed in most yield charac teristics in 2004 and 2005. In these two years, 'Cabernet' had the highest total yield, but it also had the lowest marketable yield and the greatest fraction of non-marketable fruit. On ly 22 to 37% of 'Cabernet' fruit was marketable, compared to 58 to 77% for 'Bu ffalo'. In 2005, the fraction of marketable fruit increased with shade for all cultivars except 'Buffalo'. The poor market quality of 'Cabernet' was due to cracks in the skin; 47 to 67% of the fruit had cracked skin. The incidence for other cultivars was 24 to 36% fo r 'JetStar', 14 to 16% for 'Buffalo', and 23 to 25% for 'Quest'. The effect of shade was more marked in those cultivars that were prone to cracks in the skin. 'Quest' had the most fruit with rough skin, 8 to 11 % in 2004, and 4% in 2005. 'Cabernet' had the most fruit which ripened unevenly or had green shoulder, 21 to 47%. 'JetStar' had the most blossom end rot, and the highest incidence was observed with no shade. 'JetStar' also ha d the most irregularly shaped fruit, 8 to 18%, and more fruits had an irregular shape when grown with 30 and 50% shade. For the other cultivars, only had 1 to 5% of the fru it ripened unevenly or had an irregular shape. The cultivars differed only s lightly in fruit size in 2004. In 2005, 'Buffalo' had the smallest fruit, 7.0 to 7.6 oz. Fruit size of th e other cultivars ranged from 7.9 to 9.6 oz, and the largest fruit were picked from plants grown with 15% shade. Shade appeared to be a useful means to re duce the number of fru it with cracked skin without also reducing fruit size. Although shad e did not affect marketable yield, the fraction of fruit that was marketable was least without shade a nd greatest with 50% shade. There would be an economic benefit to shade, in that less la bor would be used to pick non-marketable fruit. The labor cost per unit of marketable fruit would be lower with some degree of shade than without shade. There are about 50 growers in Connecticut who use greenhouses to extend the production season of tomatoes. Whereas they can sell unbl emished tomatoes at retail for up to $3/lb, those fruit with cracked skin or other defects ha ve to be discarded or sold at a low price. The effort to pick the crop increases with the total yield, regardle ss of how marketable it is. Labor for picking is the most signifi cant single cost of production for greenhouse tomatoes in the summer. Shading will decreas e this labor cost to the extent that it decreases the amount of fruit that is picked but unmarketable. Thus, shading will reduce the labor cost of picking and culling a crop of tomatoes, in proportion to the decrease in the fraction of unmarketable fruit. In my experience this fraction was reduced by about 15% by shading a greenhouse to reduce light transmission by 50%. Thus, shade could reduce by 15% the cost of labor for picking greenhouse tomatoes. Heirloom Tomato Trials: Interest and sales of heirl oom tomatoes have increased dramatically in the past 10 years. More and more consumers are willing to forego appearance for that real old-fashioned tomato taste. Knowledge of high yielding cultivars and cultural details would be nefit growers, especially those who serve inner city consumers who purchase these fruits at loca l farmers markets throughout the Northeast. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 131 But growing heirloom tomatoes can be a chal lenge. Heirlooms tend to have poor disease resistance and have lower yields when to compared to hybrid tomatoes. They are also more susceptible to cracking due to their tender skin. In 2005, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard evaluated ten cultivars of ethnic heirloom tomatoes for yield and quality at Windsor and Mt. Carmel . At Windsor, yield of Anna Russian and Pineapple were greatest (24.0 lb/plant) with Giant Ponderosa and Kellogg's Breakfast averaging 22.0 lb/plant. Pineapple produced th e largest fruit (11 oz /fruit) with Giant Belgian and Giant Ponderosa both averaging 8 oz/fruit. Results at Mt. Carmel were similar. These trials will continue in 2006. Personal-sized Watermelons Trials: The newest melons on the marketplace are seedless miniature \"personal\" watermelons, weighing 3-7 pounds each. Personal-sized watermelons offer an attractive alternative for small families or for consumers that have limited refrigerator space. Beside the smalle r size, they also have a thinner rind, which reduces waste. In addition, researchers ha ve found that lycopene and beta-carotene contents are abundant in personal-sized waterm elons. Lycopene, an antioxidant, has been linked to the possible prevention of cancer and heart disease. In 2005, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard evaluated five cultivars of personal sized seedless watermelon for yield and quality at Windsor (sandy terrace soil) and Mt. Carmel. At Windsor, average yield of plants mulched w ith black plastic was 38 T/A compared to 32 T/A from the unmulched plots. Mulched plot s averaged 4.4 melons/plant compared to 3.9 melons/plant from the unmulched plots. Ext azy and experimental cultivar S133 had the greatest yields (43 and Ex tazy (4.9 lb/fruit) produced the largest fruit at Windsor. At Mt. Carmel, mulched plots averaged 29 T/A compared to 22 T/A from the unmulched plots. Mulched plot s averaged 3.1 melons/plant compared to 2.9 melons/plant from the unmulched plots. Experimental cultivar S133 (28 T/A) Extazy averaged the greatest yields . Extazy (5.7 lb/fruit) produced the largest fruit (Bobbie was not grown at Mt. Carmel due to poor germination). Bobbie averaged the greatest sugar content w ith an average Brix of 13 co mpared to Extazy (11.5). All other cultivars at both sites had Brix readi ngs under 11. Extazy was very high in lycopene (95-99 ug/g) (as determined by Dr. Penelope Pe rkins) with the other cultivars averaging (54-85 ug/g). It appears from these preliminar y trials that black plastic mulch increases yields and that Extazy is the cultivar of c hoice. Research will continue with evaluations of additional varieties an d various cultural methods. Garlic Trials: Garlic, a bulbous plant closely relate d to the onion, has a wide number of market niches and is used in great quanti ties for cooking. Consumption of garlic in the U.S. has risen from 0.5 pound per person in 1985 to 3.1 pounds per person in 1999. To meet that demand, acreage devoted to the pr oduction of garlic rose from 16,000 acres to 41,000 acres, or about a 156% increase. No othe r vegetable, including popular vegetables like onions, broccoli, and carro ts, has exhibited such strong sustained growth. One factor contributing to this strong surge in use is the rising popularity of ethnic foods and proliferation of ethnic restaurants. In additi on, there have been numerous news releases 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 describing the health benefits of garlic. In 2005, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard initiated garlic variety trials by planting 6 cultivars in Octobe r. These bulbs will be harvested in July and evaluated for yield, quality, and storage durability. Future experiments will determine the effect of different mulches on yield, quali ty, and storage dura bility of garlic. Cauliflower Trials: Recent developments in the fast-food industry, to provide low- carbohydrate foods to diet-cons cious consumers, prompted a replacement of mashed potatoes with mashed cauliflower. In 1986,1987,1988,and 1994, we tested 47 cultivars of cauliflower for yield and quality. Most of the cultivars tested are no longer available from seed companies. To evaluate yield and quali ty of cauliflower cultiv ars, released since 1988, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard evaluated 12 cultivars for spring harvest at Windsor and Mt. Carmel. In spring, average yield of 12 cultivars at Windsor was 8.5T/A. Yield of Freedom was greatest (10.9 T/A) with Absolu te, Attribute, Cumberland, Minuteman, and Wentworth exceeding 9.5 T/A. There was a crop failure at Mt. Carmel due to severe browsing from woodchucks. These trials will continue in 2006. Jilo - Moisture Conservation Trials: Jilo ( Solanum gilo ) is a solanaceous plant akin to eggplant. This tropical vegetable is grow n principally in Nigeria. Its culture was transported to central and southern Brazil wh ere is became a minor crop. Its principal use is in vegetable stew (ratat ouille) and sweet and sour mi xes with chicken and pork. In 1998, a Bethel grower obtained seeds from a member of the Brazilian community in the Waterbury-Danbury area (estimated populati on 4500). The Connecticut Department of Agriculture obtained some of the seeds and sent them to the Experiment Station for further testing. We found that jilo grows we ll in Connecticut's climate and can produce up to 11 lb/plant when mulched with black pl astic to warm the soil. We also found that jilo flowers abort when subjected to moisture stress. In this experiment, use of plastic mulch or drip irrigation to improve the mo isture content of the soil throughout the growing season to prevent fruit abortion was compared to untreated controls. At Mt. Carmel (loamy upland soil), average yield of fruit from Comprido Verde Claro was 3.7 lb/plant in plants grown with black plasti c mulch and 6.6 lb/plant with drip irrigation compared to 2.6 lb/plant in control plots. It appears that the supplem ental drip irrigation was especially important in the hot and dry su mmer of 2005. These trials will continue in 2006. Calabaza - Selection for Early Maturity: Calabaza squash, also known as tropical pumpkin, is mostly grown in tropical and semi tropical climates. Calabaza is highly prized by consumers of Hispanic origin. It was identified by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture as one of the most sought-aft er vegetables at Connecticut's 65 farmers' markets. In 2003, one plant of La Estrella pr oduced mature fruit in only 90 days on 12- foot vines. Early maturing fruit are genera lly found on the vine within 2 feet of the planting site. Fruit that mature in 90 days is appealing to norther n growers because the majority of fruit can mature before frost. W ith a traditional maturity of 120 days, some fruit that form late on the vine do not reach maturity. We saved the seeds from the fruit planted them at Mt. Carmel and Windsor in 2005. At Windsor, 17% of the plants The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 133 produced early-maturing fruit (90 days) within 2 feet of the planting site while only 4% produced early fruit at Mt. Carmel. The great er success at Windsor may be due to an adjacent cover crop of buckwheat, a known bee a ttractant, which helped to pollinate early forming female flowers. At . Mt. Carmel, the adjacent cover crop of soybeans did not attract bees. These trials will continue in 2006. Sheet Composting of Oak and Maple Leaves : Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turn ing to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer und ecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf d ecomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet composting operati on. This is also a situ ation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predomin ance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr. Abigail A. Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2004 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. Yields of lettuce, rutabaga , and edible soybeans were compared to yields from the control plots where no leaves were added. All plots received the same amount of 10-10-10 fertil izer applied at the recommended rate for vegetable production (1300 lbs/A). In 2005, lettuc e yields were virtually the same for all the treatments with plots amended with maple leaves and the contro l plots averaging 1.2 lbs/head. Plots amended with undecomposed oak leaves averaged 1.3 lbs/head. Plots amended with oak leaves averaged the greatest soybean yields (2.7 lbs/plot) compared to plots amended with maple leaves (2.2 lbs/plot ) and the control plots (2.0 lbs/plot) (all dry weights). The greatest rutabaga yields were from plots amended with maple leaves (2.8 lbs/plant) compared to plots amended w ith oak leaves and the control plots (1.8 lbs/plant). It appears that a pplications of oak or maple l eaves are not deleterious to vegetable production but the experiment will be continued to dete rmine the effect of repeated applications of oak or maple leaves. Specialty Fruit Variety Trials : As wholesale marketing of major tree fruits becomes unprofitable, many Connecticut growers are turni ng to retail sales of their fruit. For a retail operation to be succe ssful, there must be a dive rsity of products. Thus, many growers are interested in adding minor specialty fruits to their operations. In response to this grower interest, Dr. A. Abigail Maynard in 2001 expanded the New Crops Program at the Station to include fruits. This trial, also repeated at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, includes 12 cultivar/rootstock combinations of Japanese plum and 4 cultivars of pawpaws. At Windsor, the greatest yields in 2005 were from Shiro (129 lbs/tree) and Friar (122 lbs/tree). B eauty and Obilnaja averaged 64 lbs/tree. Fortune and Methley produced the largest plums averaging 2.5 ounces and 2.3 ounces, respectively. Production at Mt. Carmel has been delayed due to h eavy deer browse. In addition, in Spring 2003, 134 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 210 beach plum seedlings were planted at Lockwood Farm and 96 at the Valley Lab. These seedlings were raised at Cornell Univ ersity from seeds collected from 35 sites from Maine to Delaware. The trees will be ev aluated annually and select elite individuals will be propagated as possible cultivars in the future. In their third growing season, seedlings from Cape Henlopen State Park, De laware, averaged the greatest growth (21.2 inches) at Lockwood Farm while seedlings fr om Delaware Seashore State Park averaged 20.3 inches. There was no production due to se vere deer browse. At Windsor, 44% of the New Hampshire cultivar plants and 15% of the cultivar Ocean Side produced over 6 pounds/plant. Wine grape growers and Farm Wineries face several challenges. Farm Wineries are required to grow a minimum of 25% of the fruit in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard. Consecutive ve ry cold winters in 2003 and 2004 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold hardy vari eties, and have dr iven up prices for purchasing Connecticut and out-of- state fruit. Little information is available to growers regarding cultural information for growing mo re cold hardy and di sease resistant hybrid varieties in the state. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The i ndustry requires incr eased production via better management practices in existing vi neyards and improved variety selection in newly planted vineyards. Wine Grapes . Dr. William R. Nail initiated studies in 2004-2006 to help determine cultural practices for growing high quality wi ne grapes profitably in Connecticut. The wine grape industry in Connect icut is rapidly expanding- th e first Farm Winery in the state opened in 1979, and there are currently 22 wineries with a Fa rm or Commercial Winery license, with 2 or 3 more scheduled to open in the foreseeable future. The existence of these wineries adds substantiall y to local economies, as local restaurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts, etc. receive in creased business due to their proximity. The Connecticut Wine Trail brochure, published by the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association, is the most popular brochure in Department of Tourism travel offices. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera . Dr. William R. Nail established a planting of 288 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summe r 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock, and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tolerance to severe wi nter freezes. The first (small) crop of grapes from this plot is anticipated in 2006, and vari ous cultural experiments will be initiated to determine better strategies for optimum yield and fruit quality. Reducing cluster compactness . Harvest rots are a major problem if climactic conditions are favorable for disease development between veraison and harvest. Based on published results the increased susceptibility of tight-clu stered cultivars and clones is a result cluster of compactness rather than being genetic in nature. Reducing photosynthesis by leaf removal at bloom has been shown to reduce fruit set, resulting in looser clusters. However, since the leaves are permanently re moved, this reduction in photosynthesis has The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 135 negative consequences for bud fruitfulness in the subsequent gr owing season. Studies with the herbicide Terbacil have shown that by temporarily reducing photosynthesis, fruit set can be reduced with no long-term negativ e consequences. Terbaci l is not labeled for such a use, and it is extremely unlikely th at a grower would confidently apply an herbicide to his or her crop if it were. JMS Stylet oil is la beled for use on grapes as a fungicide and insecticide, and is used by many growers, espe cially organic ones. It has been shown to slightly redu ce photosynthesis, and can result in lower fruit soluble solids if over applied. JMS Stylet oil was applied duri ng bloom of 2006 to selected Pi not Gris vines. Single leaf photosynthesis measurements were made before and after application. Flower primordia on clusters opposite measured leaves were c ounted. Fruit set, clus ter compactness, and harvest rot incidence and severity will be de termined. The experiment will be continued for at least two more years to ensure that th ere are no negative eff ects of this practice. Effects of graft union height . Freeze damage to grafted grap evines frequently occurs at the graft union, which is typi cally very close to the ground. Elevating the height of the graft union may result in less injury. Ch ardonnay clone 96 budwood was grafted onto 3309C rootstock at standard height and 26 inches higher, and the vines will be transplanted in spring 2007 at Lockwood Fa rm. Vines will be evaluated for vine performance, winter survival, and crown gall incidence and seve rity in subsequent years. Funding for this project was obtained fr om the Viticulture Consortium East. Spacing and training in hybrid varieties . Dr. William R. Nail established a new planting of the hybrid varieties St. Cr oix, Cayuga White, and Tramine tte in May, 2005 at a private grower's vineyard. St. Croix and Cayuga White are among the most widely planted red and white varieties, respectively, in the state, and Traminette is a relatively new release from the Cornell breeding program which show s much promise. Hybrid varieties have different growth habits a nd management issues than V. vinifera , which may involve fundamental issues both before and after pl anting. Plants of all three varieties were planted at 6 and 8 foot spacings, and will be grown on different training systems: low wire, Vertically Shoot Positioned (VSP), H udson River Umbrella (HRU), Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), and another di vided canopy system such as Scott Henry. Those on 6 foot spacing will also be pruned to both cane and cordon systems. Pruning and training systems will be established beginning in sp ring, 2007.The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help ma ximize their production, as well as possibly demonstrating that some systems are not efficient in Connecticut. A planting of Seyval Blanc, Chambourcin, Villa rd Blanc, and Villard Noir at Lockwood Farm was rejuvenated in 2004, and vines were either cordon or cane pruned in 2005 and 2006 to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Yield and fruit quality parameters were determined beginni ng in the 2005 harvest s eason. Initial data suggest that cordon pruning is a viable alternat ive to the cane pruning used in most Connecticut vineyards. 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Cultivar and clonal evaluation . Previously established experi mental plots at two private grower's vineyards and the Valle y Laboratory were evaluated by Dr. William R. Nail beginning in 2004. One vineyard was established to compare Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cabernet Sauvignon has displayed high vine mortality and poor fruit quality due to lack of ripeness. Ca bernet Franc and Merlot both produced good quality fruit, although yields in Merlot were slightly lower. There may be differences in performance of different clones and/or rootstocks for these tw o varieties, but data will have to be collected through the 2006 grow ing season before any conclusions can be drawn. At another vineyard several V. vinifera and hybrid varieties were compared. Hybrids outyield most vinifera varieties. Data from this vine yard will also be collected through the 2006 growing season. In 2004 and 2005, Riesling fruit was considerably less mature at harvest than any other white variety, indicating the need to harvest it later than other varieties or, if all va rieties are treated the same, to consider not planting it. Dr. William R. Nail plans to establish a new study at Lockwood Farm to compare cultivars of V. vinifera and hybrids. This study will be co ordinated with researchers from other states throughout the country as NE- 1020: Multi-State Evaluation of Winegrape Cultivars and Clones. This project should he lp answer the questions \"What are the criteria for selecting a particular variety?\" and \"What cultivar(s) is(are) most suited to my situation?\" DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY & ECOLOGY Biological control employing earthworms Earthworm activity is associated with healthy soils. It is generally believed that they accomplish this by processing organic matter and by facilitating wa ter infiltration and breaking up hardpans through their burrowing. More importantly, we have learned that earthworm castings are rich in microbes that can reduce root disease. Dr. Wade Elmer established greenhouse experiments to dete rmine whether or not earthworm activity could affect disease of aspara gus in replanted soil infested with Fusarium pathogens. In repeated studies with asparagus, plants associ ated with earthworms were twice as large, had 50% fewer root lesions, and had 5 to 10 times as many beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere as in the control plots. Fluorescent pseudomonads and filamentous actinomycetes were the major groups affected. Earthworm emerging from the root zone of a young asparagus plant. Earthworms directly improve root health and can offer a means for delivering biological control agents to the roots of established plantings. Field plots were esta blished in 2005 and 2006 using eggplants, tomatoes, and asparagus as model systems for studying if earthworms could The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 137 reduce disease and increase yield. Plots wh ere earthworms were introduced had larger plants, more yield, and less disease. Although it is known that earthworms increa se the numbers of naturally occurring beneficial microbes in their castings, Dr. Elmer has demons trated that they can also distribute introduced biocontrol agents ( BCA) throughout the soil around plant roots. Studies done with two be neficial nonpathogenic F. oxysporum isolates (CWB 318 and CS-20) showed that earthworm activity incr eased colonization of asparagus and tomato roots by these two BCA. Impact . Understanding how earthworm activity a ffects root health may lead to more improved means of enhancing soil health in problem fields and may offer a unique method of delivering biocontrol agents to the roots of esta blished (Corn stubble survey wheat is caused by Fusarium graminearum , a fungus that produces carcinogenic mycotoxins in grain. The fungus can infect other hosts, most notably corn. Since wheat is not grown in Connecticut, Drs. Elmer and Ferrandino questioned whether F. graminearum would persist at levels reported for regions where wheat and corn are cropped in close proximit y. Six corn farms were sampled in 2004 and 2005 and over 1600 isolates of Fusarium were identified to species. The two most prevalent species found were F. graminearum (30%) and F. subglutinans (18%) . Statistical analyses suggested that there was an inverse relationship between the prevalence of these two species, indicating that one species might be able to colonize corn stubble more effectively than the other. Laboratory assays to study the competitive ability of the two species to co lonize corn stubble showed that F. graminearum was far more competitive than F. subglutinans and may explain its high prevalence in Connecticut cornfields. Ornamental Disease Research. China asters were evaluated by Dr. Wade Elmer for resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. callistephi . Most plants were suscepti ble to some degree, but eight cultivars were not significantly different fr om the control plants grown in noninfested soil. Following initial tests in the greenhouse, these eight cu ltivars were evaluated along with susceptible cultivars in field plots at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Lab in Windsor for their resistance to Fusarium wilt. Of the eight cultivars previously found to be resistant in greenhouse trials, only three cultivars had good fi eld resistance to Fusarium wilt. They were Aster combination 7892, Astoria Mix Aster 2087, and Stokes Aster Sandy Mix. Six other cultivars produced flower s that did not differ statistically in number from the noninfested controls, but these cultivars did show more signs of disease. Fusarium corm rot of gladiolus is caused by Fusarium oxysporum and is the most destructive root diseas e of gladiolus. To determine if disease could be suppressed by combining a product that activates de fense mechanisms, viz., acibenzolar- S-methyl (Actigard 50 WP) (ASM), Dr. Elmer soaked corms for 30 minutes in Actigard (ASM) combined either with or without biological or chemical fungicides in 2003-2005. The 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 object was to determine if any of these trea tment combinations could provide season-long suppression of Fusarium corm rot. Suscepti ble corms treated with ASM did not show a significant decrease in disease progress, but did show a 48% increase in the number of marketable flowers. None of the biological fungicides were effective in reducing disease progress or in increasing flower spike nu mber, however, the chemical fungicides, fludioxinil (Medallion 50 WP) and triflumi zole (Terraguard 50 WP) reduced disease progress and increased flower spike number. No interactions were noted between the ASM and the fungicides except for when ASM was combined with azoxystrobin (Heritage 50 WP). ASM and azoxystrobin used separately were not effective in reducing disease progress, but when they were combin ed they provided season-long suppression of corm rot. Continued research on ASM for or namentals may offer an additional strategy for reducing corm rot. Impact . Fusarium diseases are extremely difficu lt to control with chemicals. When host resistance is present, it provi des the most economically effici ent management available. We found alternative strategies that employ combinations of new chemistries provide some suppression for growers. Sudden dieback of wetland vegetation In the summer and fall of 2002, large areas of emergent vegetation at several sites along Long Island Sound began to disappear. The loss was mostly restricted to Spartina alterniflora and S. patens . In 1999, Louisiana suffered a similar phenomenon where Fusarium pathogens were associated with dieb ack areas, but these pathogens were not the single cause of the decline. Since the n, almost every coastal state from Maine to Louisiana has reported sudden wetland dieback. Loss of wetland flora like Spartina has drastic implications for coastal ecology and marine life. In 2005, Dr. Elmer sampled three sites in Hammonasset State Park, Madison, CT, and recovered several species of Fusarium sp. Pathogenicity tests are underway. Molecular analyses of the Fusarium isolates by Dr. Kerry O'Donnell of ARS USDA in Peoria, IL, have shown that the isolates are new species. Continued sampling and monitoring are ongoing in 2006. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 139 Impact : Loss of wetland flora like Spartina has drastic implications for coastal ecology and marine life. Aerial dispersal of corn pollen The extensive adoption of genetically modi fied crops has led to a need to better understand the dispersal of pollen in the at mosphere because of the potential for unwanted movement of genetic traits via pollen flow in the environment. The ability to model maize pollen transport in the atmospheric surface layer is important both for predicting gene flow be tween neighboring fields on the same or nearby farms and for establishing a real istic boundary condition for a convective boundary layer (CBL) model that can be used to predict longer distance transport. Drs. Donald Aylor and Matthew Boehm and Elson Shields (Cornell University) studied the aerial dispersal of maize pollen by comparing th e results of a Lagrangi an stochastic (LS) model with pollen concentration measuremen ts made over 26-ha cornfields using a combination sample rs and airborne radio-controlled, remote- piloted vehicles outfitted with remotely operated pollen samplers. Remote-piloted vehicle (RPV) flying above a cornfield to sample corn pollen. The irregular red lines represent the model generated trajectories of corn pollen grains released from the tassels. A modeled value for the concentration co rresponding to each RPV measured value was calculated by simulating the RPV flight path through the LS model pollen plume corresponding to the atmospheric conditions, field geometry, wind direction, and source strength. The geometric mean and geometric standard deviation of the ratio of modeled to measured concentrations, C model/Cmeasure , over all the downwind sampling periods were 1.42 and 4.53, respectively, and the lognormal dist ribution corresponding to these values was found to closely fit the probability densit y function (PDF) of th e ratio. Model output was sensitive to the tu rbulence parameters, with a factor of 100 difference in the average value of Cmodel over the range of values encountered during the experiment. Compared to this large potential variabili ty, we conclude that the av erage factor of 1.4 between Cmodel and Cmeasure found here indicates that the LS model is capable of accurately predicting, on average, concentrations over a range of atmospheric conditions. The model tended to better predict concentrat ions when winds were at least moderate ( u* > 0.25 m s-1) than 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 during lighter wind conditions, when all meteorological parameters, including wind direction, were less well defined. This empha sizes the need to incorporate convective boundary layer properties into the model. This work is currently in progress. Impact: The model of aerial dispersal of corn pollen being developed here will allow for objective evaluations of the risks of off- site pollen movement, and will provide a framework for improving strategies for regul ating off-site gene flow, estimating the potential off-target effects of GM pollen, and determining the impact of off-site movement of GM pollen on the potential market ability of non-GM corn. Applications of the model include establishment of isolation gui delines for field testing new genetic traits incorporated into open-pollinated plants and evaluation of regional cropping plans where conflicts might arise between conven tional and organic farm communities. Pollen deposition on corn silks Key determinants of seed purity and yield in maize are the deposition efficiency of pollen on silks and the competition between pollen grains from different sources to fertilize the ovules. This requires an accu rate assessment of the amount of pollen released in a cornfield that reaches the female flowers (silks) as well as a physical description of deposition of pollen grains on i ndividual silks within a growing silk brush. Dr. Donald Aylor devised a method using a combination of measurements and modeling for quantifying pollen flux at silk Silks emerging from the tip of a corn ear. Each silk is attached to an ovule and must be fertilized by a pollen grain in order to produce a seed. The amount of pollen reaching silk height depends on leaf area density, pollen retention, and turbulence. height. Model estimates for the average rele ase rate of pollen grai ns per area of crop, Q (grains m-2 s-1), were deduced by comparing measured and modeled values of C. Using these determinations of Q, the model predicted well ( r2 = 0.73) the measured pollen fluxes in the canopy. On average, about 20% of the pollen released by the tassels reached the height of the silks in the canopy. Measured fluxes of pollen at silk height we re highly variable; this variability was mainly due to the faster wind speeds and hi gher levels of turbul ence in the upper canopy, which led to greater amounts of rebound and re-e ntrainment of pollen grains from leaves. The results of this study underscore the importance of rebound and re-entrainment The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 141 processes in the amount of maize pollen reach ing the silks. The strengths of this approach are that it can be used to exam ine a wide array of conditions and planting schemes and that the model results are conveni ently expressed in terms of the potential pollen production of the \"male\" parent in the field, allowing ready comparison across inbred and hybrid varieties. This flexibil ity should be of part icular value to seed producers interested in improvi ng the efficiency and purity of seed production in their fields. Impact: The model of aerial dispersal of corn pollen being developed here will allow for objective evaluations of the risks of off- site pollen movement, and will provide a framework for improving strategies for regul ating off-site gene flow, estimating the potential off-target effects of GM pollen, a nd the impact of off-site movement of GM pollen on the potential marketability of non-GM corn. Applications of this model include establishment of isolation gui delines for both field testing new genetic traits and hybrid seed production, evaluation of regional cropping plans invo lving neighboring conventional and organic farms, and pred iction of the impact on international marketability of non-GM corn. Nectria canker on black birch Dr. Francis Ferrandino has been studying the ecology of Nectria Canker on black birch trees in the forests of Connecticut. Black birch is becoming an increasingly important component of the northeastern fore sts due to its prolific production of seeds and its resistance to deer br owsing and gypsy moth defoliation. High canker incidence is common within birch-dominated forest stands. Culling of infected trees seems like a logica l control measure. However, the results of a recent five-year study made on Water Company property near Lake Saltonstall indicated that when infected trees were cut down, cankers on the logs produced spores at 5-9 times the rate of cankers on uncut infect ed trees. This enhanced spore production lasted for a period of two years until the felled logs succumbed to rotting Black birch canker disfigures the trees and renders their worth nothing more than firewood. organisms. Similarly, cankers on girdled trees sporulated at 3-5 times the rate of ca nkers on ungirdled trees for a period of 3 to 4 years. Since young trees (<20 years old) are most susceptible to this 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 disease, the early release of such high levels of inoculum would lik ely increase the spread of Nectria Canker. Aerial application of pesticides In July of 2001, The Connecticut Agricultur al Experiment Station was charged with conducting a study of aerial pesticide applicat ion to shade tobacco to investigate off- target drift (General Assembly B ill 7507 Sec. 71). Station scientists, Drs. LaMondia, Ferrandino, and Mattina , studied the amount of spray dr ift at distances up to 1000 feet from a helicopter-sprayed shade tobacco tent in Enfield, CT. Over 2,000 samples were collected during ten spray date s over a two-year period. Thes e samples were chemically analyzed to detect the quanti ty of the applied f ungicide (Acrobat MZ) blown off-target. The results of this study have resulted in a Helicopter applies chemical spray to an agricultural field. Station Bulletin (B1003). In way of summar y, 85% of the samples beyond 25 feet from the edge of the sprayed shade tent had no detectable chemical. The samples on which the fungicide could be detected were all at tr ace levels and below the quantifiable limit of 0.016 \u00b5g AI/cm 2. In fact, if tomatoes were grown as close as 25 feet from the shade tent, the levels of fungicide on the fruit would not have exceeded the established EPA Market Basket Food Tolerances. Water-sensitive pape rs placed out during application indicated that the off-target drift was car ried in small droplets (< 0.004 i n. in diameter). This result points out the importance of using coarse sp ray nozzles, which are kept clean and well adjusted, in order to minimize th e number of tiny spray droplets. Milk-based sprays to control mildew For the past five growing seasons, Dr. Fe rrandino has studied the effects of using milk-based foliar sprays to reduce the economic impact of powdery mildew epidemics on pumpkins and muskmelon. Treatments based on milk were, on average, about 50% to 70% as effective in reducing a foliar symptoms and postharvest fruit rot as the chemical control. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 143 Pumpkin field showing adja cent areas of diseased (white) and sprayed (green) plants. Healthy plants were protected from powdery mildew by applying milk in a water-based spray. Overall, milk-sprayed plots were 40% to 50% as effective in increasing marketable yield as chemical fungicides. This result is importa nt where the use of chem ical controls is not desirable for example: strict \"organic\" fa rms, or backyard and community gardens. Biology of the Target Canker pathogen The species delimitation, natural history, a nd population structure of the ascomycete fungus causing target canker on birch (Neon ectria canker; also previously known as Nectria canker) are poorly understood. The fungus causing the disease is Neonectria ditissima for its use in producing veneers, although cankers caused by N. ditissima can render the tree and its wood virtually usele ss in this regard. Black bi rch has become the dominant hardwood in eastern forests, including thos e in Connecticut, and concurrent with the tree's increasing frequency is the increasing frequency of Neonectria canker. Dr. Robert Marra's research on Neonectria canker focuses on the ecology and genetics of this fungal pathogen, with the goa l of gaining a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, and population dynamics of the organism a nd its interactions with its hosts, and using this knowledge to devel op effective biocontrol strategies. The groundwork for this research involves developi ng a system of genetic markers that will permit fine-scale analysis of mating patterns, spore dispersal, a nd population structure. Developing informative genetic markers requir es a set of isolates from as wide a distribution as possible, under the assumpti on that they represent maximum genetic diversity. Dr. Marra collect ed the majority of his Neonectria isolates in 2004 from a variety of locations within the state, principally from B. lenta , with a small number from B. alleghaniensis one sample from sassafras ( Sassafras supplement this collection, Dr. Marra has obt ained, from colleagues, cultures from Canada, Europe, and other parts of the U. S. With an efficient and economical DNA extraction procedure now in place, initial gene tic analyses are underway . The first set of markers being explored is called Amplifie d Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP). This procedure exploits the Polymerase Ch ain Reaction (PCR) in scanning the entire genome for polymorphic restriction sites; i.e., th ose that may be present in some isolates but absent in others. Using this technique, markers have been identified and will be used to analyze populations of the pathogen. 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 A thorough understanding of Neonectria's population biology also requires an understanding of its mating system. Successful matings have been achieved in laboratory crosses allowing us to study ascospore pr ogeny using the aforementioned markers. (Left panel). Perithecia emerging from the edge of a sterilized wounded birch stem embedded in agar in a Petri dish. The conical tips of the perithecia dehisce when mature, releasing the ascospores contained within. (Right panel). Ascospores isolated from a perithecium from a laboratory mating. The study of ascospore progeny is impor tant to field studies. Using the aforementioned markers, we can determine (1) if they are the result of outcrossing or self-fertilization, and (2 ) if outcrossed, the extent to whic h they are inbred or outbred. Understanding this aspect of the mating sy stem sheds light on the fungus' dispersal patterns, and will be critical to development of a biocontrol program. Impact: Over the past sixty or so years, black birch has become an increasingly important component of Connecticut forests, both in terms of the number of trees and the amount of wood. By either metric, it appear s that black birch is taking the lead over oaks, maples, beeches, and other species. Cankers caused by Neonectria cause major disfigurement, even though trees can persis t for decades with several to many such cankers along their stems. These heavily cankered mature trees, which compete for resources (water, light, nutrients), have a si gnificantly negative economic and aesthetic impact. The genetics and epidemiology of the fungus and its role in the forest are poorly understood. Knowledge gained from studi es of Neonectria canker will suggest appropriate hypotheses on biocontrol strategies. Ramorum Blight Ramorum Blight, a disease of over 70 plant species that is currently ravaging the coastal oak forests of central Califor nia and Oregon, is caused by the Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum . The pathogen, which is transp orted on host nursery stock from west coast production nurseries, poses a seri ous threat to Connecticut's landscapes and forests, which include numerous proven hosts. Drs. Marra and Douglas are interested in determining the overwintering potential of the pathogen, and have succe ssfully applied for a USDA-APHIS-PPQ permit allowing them to use P. ramorum cultures for research purposes , including performing leaf inoculations. Using Rhododendron, Kalmia , and Syringa plants donated by area nurseries, Dr. Marra is performing detached leaf inoculations to study the effects of desiccation and low temper ature on pathogen survival in infected leaves. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 145 Dr. Marra and Dr. Douglas have been s upervising the implementation of USDA- mandated assays for detection of P. ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Oregon, or Washingt on. Beginning this year (20 06), these assays are being carried out by technician Jason Corwin. The pr ocess begins with a serological test called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. If a sample tests positive by ELI SA, attempts are made to isolate the pathogen from the infected plant material, and DNA is extracted for molecular analyses. Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory Efforts to achieve APHIS certification in Ramorum Blight diagnostics have been successful, due in large part to the creation of a new laboratory, the MPDL, designed by Dr. Marra and adjacent to his current labor atory. The MPDL is now being used for conventional and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as well as other molecular techniques. This facility inco rporates state-of-the-art equipm ent, and has the capability to quickly and accurately identify new and emer ging pathogens. The certification process involved the inspection by APHIS staff of th e MPDL as well as the laboratories of Dr. Marra and Dr. Douglas. Also involved in the certification process was the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), conforming to guidelines outlined by PPQ in The department's new Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory (MPDL). Jason Corwin, technician, is preparing samples for r eal-time PCR analysis. order to guarantee the veracity of results and minimize the potential for accidental escape of the pathogen. Among the MPDL's new capabilities is a technique called SSCP (Single Strand Conformational Polymorphisms), which has been demonstrated to be useful in distinguishing among Phytophthora species. Identifying species within the Phytophthora genus has been difficult and very time-consum ing in the past, due to difficulties in culturing and in obtaining the spore stages necessary for species determination. The Phytophthora SSCP procedure requires only a very small amount of DNA, which can be obtained from an initial culture or directly from infected plant material. The procedure exploits minor differences among species in the sequence of a conserved region of DNA called the ITS region. Figure Q shows the SSCP patterns for a number of different Phytophthora species, including four samples from Viburnum that were brought into the 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Plant Disease Information Office, and that we re proving difficult to identify. The SSCP procedure confirms the iden tity of these samples as P. cinnamomi . SSCP profiles of several Phytophthora species. Four unidentified samples from the CAES Plant Disease Information Office were all shown by SSCP analysis to be P. cinnamomi . Lanes on the left and right of the gel contain \"ladder\" DNA for reference purposes only. Impact: P. ramorum is a pathogen of growing concer n in Connecticut because of the many species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this concern centers on C onnecticut's significant nursery industry, which at over $1 billion in annual production ranks Connecticut am ong the ten largest in the country. Nurseries found to ha ve plants infected with P. ramorum are effectively quarantined until rigorously demonstrated to be clear of the pathogen, a process that can take several months. Therefore, Ramorum Blight, independent of its impact on our forests and landscapes, can have a significan t impact on the state' s economy. Many of the most susceptible hosts\u2014eastern red oa k, rhododendron, lilac, mountain laurel, and viburnum, to name a few\u2014are significant pa rts of the nursery industry as well as Connecticut forests and lands capes. Given that the eastern United States, including Connecticut, is considered at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the po ssible release of the pathoge n into the environment is warranted. Through the new Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laborator y, Dr. Marra's goal is to accelerate and refine our ability to identify P. ramorum in infected plants from the nursery, garden center, forest, and landscape, greatly increasing our chances of averting a Ramorum Blight epidemic. Addi tionally, the molecular diagno stic techniques being used and under development in the MPDL will continue to enhance the disease diagnostics services provided to Connecticut's stakeholders. Chestnut Breeding for Orchard and Timber Trees Planting chestnut hybrids (which are resistant to chestnut blight disease) in forest clear-cuts, and keeping the native American ches tnuts in the area alive by treatments with hypovirulent strains of the chestnut blight pathogen, will allow cro ssing to occur between the trees and the establishment of a population of timber chestnut trees resistant to blight and adapted to the local niche. The Expe riment Station's breeding program to produce chestnuts for orchards and for timber (under the direction of Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis ) yielded 1,252 seeds this year. Of these, 190 are being grown in Vermont by a cooperator to test them for winter hardiness. Ther e are 40 being grown by a middle school in Port Chester, New York, to test their growth in the soil type there, and as an educational project for the students. The remaining seed s are being raised for us by a nursery in The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 147 Georgia, and one-year-old seedlings will be sent back to us for test plantings in Connecticut forests in 2007. Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis on a ladder at The Chestnut Plantation at Sl eeping Giant. White paper bags protect female flowers until the flowers are ready to receive pollen about a week later. The bags are then replaced an d remain until harvest in the fall. Forty seedlings from last year's crosses we re planted in a clear-cut in the Farmington Town Forest this May to see whether they can survive in the heavy soil found in this area. This year, many new crosses are being made for both timber plantings and for more detailed information on the genetics of chest nuts. In addition, crosses of some of our better nut-producing trees will yield seed to test for improved orchard productivity. Butternut Trees in Connecticut Butternut populations are declining thr oughout the native range, due to an exotic fungus that caused lethal cankers . Healthy trees, and infected trees that apparently have resistance and survived the disease, have been found in severely affected forest stands in 19 states. Our cooperators in Tennessee are propagating trees exhi biting resistance and using them in their breeding program for restor ation efforts. Last year we planted, in Pamela Sletten standing among the butternut trees and hay-scented ferns in the Mattatuck State Forest. 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 the Mattatuck State Forest, seedlings from five families of butternut from western North Carolina. We examined the trees for survival this spring. The tree s are in two groups with slightly different conditions. One gr oup is surrounded by grass, and the other by hay-scented ferns, and survival was better among the ferns (57%) than in the grass (25%). Twigs with symptoms of butternut canker dis ease were taken to the laboratory for testing. Noteworthy Plant Health Problems Unusual outbreaks of Sclerotium crown rot occurred during the hot, humid conditions of summer 2005. These occurred on a number of container and field-grown herbaceous perennials including hosta, ajuga, stachys, phy sostegia, and many others. Sclerotium crown rot, caused by the fungus Sclerotium rolfsii, is generally more common in more southerly regions of the US. Other names for this disease that reflect its normal geographical occurrence are Southern Bli ght and Southern Wilt. Initial aboveground symptoms include discoloration of lower l eaves, wilting, and plant collapse. These can be followed by quick plant death, or \"me ltdown,\" as described by many growers. Symptoms are easily confused with other basal stem rots such as those caused by Rhizoctonia or other fungi. However, fluffy, fan-like, white, stringy mycelium (often with a distinct \"mushroomy\" odor) near the plant root/cro wn area on the potting mix or soil can be used to distinguish Sclerotium cr own rot from other diseases. This fungus forms sclerotia, a distinguishing char acteristic of this disease. Diagnostic sclerotia or resting structures of the Sclerotium crown rot fungus. Sclerotia are compact masses of funga l hyphae that can su rvive unfavorable environmental conditions. They are first white, and then darken to tan as they mature. These structures resemble \"tiny mustard seed s\" that are about .04-.08 inch in diameter. As these sclerotia germinate, the fungal my celium or mass of funga l threads grow across the media surface during warm, humid weather. The fungus secretes enzymes that break down the plant tissue, especially at the crown, so that large leaves, such as hosta, wilt and collapse. On many different groundcovers, wi lting may not occur and one needs to look closely for the presence of the fungus. Sclerotium does not produce airborne spores, but it can readily spread by the sclerotia in the co ntainer mix or soil, or on plants, tools and other equipment, and shoes. S. rolfsii has a wide host range including many different ornamentals, fruits, and vegetables in over 200 different plant genera. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 149 Powdery mildews continued to be unusually heavy on many hos ts. Of particular note were outbreaks on peony. Powdery mildew symptoms on peony. This was observed in 2005 and again in spring 2006. Symptoms developed very early in the season and resulted in stunti ng, poor flower production, and early senescence for many heavily infected plants. Other hosts with notable powdery mildew infections were dogwood, oak, maple, forsythia, rhododend ron, phlox, monarda, coleus, and verbena. Roses had very early and very heavy infections of both powdery mildew and black spot and many cultivars were defoliated by mid-June. The extended drought conditions of 2005 lifte d in October, when over 15 inches of rain fell throughout Connecticut in a period of several weeks. As a result of this volume of rainfall, extended periods of waterlogge d soils occurred in many sites. These conditions resulted in a number of problems. Some woody trees and shrubs came out of their heat- and drought-induced dormancy and initiated new and untimely spurts of growth. This reversal of dormancy resulted in tender growth that was highly susceptible to the cold temperatures of early winter. Other waterlogged plants developed symptoms associated with impaired root function and were also predisposed to Phytophthora root rot infections. The winter of 2005-2006 was warmer than usual and had dramatic temperature fluctuations, freeze-thaw cycles, and unusually warm midwinter temperatures. These conditions were exacerbated by the fall weathe r previously describe d. The record warm temperatures in January caused many trees a nd shrubs to begin to break dormancy and resulted in sub-lethal damage to the cam bium, \"frost heaving,\" and bud death when seasonal temperatures returned. All of thes e factors were implicated in problems that showed up on woody ornamentals and perennials as growth was initiated this spring. Among the species of particular concern were flowering cherry, dogwood, Japanese maple, buddleia, and rhododendr on. Many trees that flowered and \"leafed-out\" looking apparently normal suddenly collapsed seve ral months into the season. Among those affected were weeping cherry, beech, and redbud. Significant dieback and death were reported on roses. In addition to problems in landscape plants, commercial growers of 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 container woody ornamentals also dealt with substantial winter damage to container- grown lilac, euonymus, holly, spirea, and quince as a result of the unus ual winter weather pattern. The cool, wet conditions of spring 2006 re sulted in many bacterial diseases of herbaceous and woody ornamentals. Dr. Douglas identified bacterial leaf spot and blight (Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae ) on many woody hosts in commercial production and in landscape plantings. Hosts included diseases were rudbeckia, delphinium, anemone, and chrysanthemum. Disease Survey Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman diagnosed a wi de range of plant health problems for homeowners, commercial growers, plant care professionals, and government, state, and cooperative extension personnel du ring the past year. Fungal a nd bacterial diseases were the more prevalent although se veral viral diseases were also identified on many hosts. As a consequence of predisposition by drought, an unusually high number of fungal tip blights (Diplodia tip blight blights of junipers) and numerous cankers and s the fungi Botryosphaeria , Phomopsis , and Cytospora were observed. Also prevalent were increased incidences of root problems associated with Armillaria and Phytophthora on many woody hosts . Many drought-stressed plants also showed increased sensitivity to air pollutants and pesticides to which they were exposed. The trend for unusually high incidences of va scular wilt diseases evident in previous years continued during '05-'06 and symptoms were observed on several key ornamental tree species throughout Connecticut. Of pa rticular concern was Dutch elm disease caused by the fungi Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi . This historically important disease infects elm and was diagnosed on old, established specimens as well as on recently planted trees. Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium spp. was also diagnosed by Dr. Douglas on numerous tree species incl uding maple, smokebush, tuliptree, tree lilac, and redbud. While many species of maple were affected, Japanese maples appeared to be particularly susceptibl e and often collapsed shortly af ter the disease was diagnosed. While both of these vascular wilt diseases us ually result in a slow , general decline and flagging of limbs, this year many trees exhibited atypical symptoms. These included complete failure to \"leaf out\" in spring and sudden, midseason death. Both wilt diseases appeared to have been enhanced by root da mage from several years of drought and other environmental stresses. Decline of ash, especially white ash, con tinued to be a problem throughout the state and prompted many questions from homeowners and arborists. This syndrome appeared to be exacerbated by the prolonged drought and, in some cases, was associated with the phytoplasma causing ash yellows. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 151 Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman continued to respond to many inquiries about Ramorum Blight from concerned and interested resident s in the state. Although this disease has not been found in Connecticut, public awaren ess and concern ar e still evident. Bleeding canker of European beech was di agnosed with increasing frequency during the 2005 and 2006 season. Cankers were identif ied on mature, specimen trees with no previous history of problems. In addition to the typical blee ding cankers characteristic of this disease, atypical non -bleeding cankers were found. Several species of Phytophthora were isolated from these cankers and Dr. Douglas is working with Dr. Marra and Mr. Corwin to characterize the most prevalent sp ecies associated with bleeding cankers in Connecticut. Daylily streak, caused by Aureobasidium microstictum, continued to be a problem on daylilies, and rust on hollyhoc k was particularly early and heavy throughout the season. Numerous instances of Vertic illium wilt of impatiens were diagnosed by Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman. In most cases, impatiens had b een planted in the same locations for many years and this resulted in the buildup of the soilborne fungus in these sites. Viral diseases were detected on many herbaceous hosts. Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), and th rips-transmitted necrotic and tomato spotte d wilt virus (TSWV), continued to threaten many types of greenhouse, landscape orname ntals, vegetable, and herb crops in Connecticut. Unusually high populations of thri ps contributed to the high prevalence of these diseases, which were confirmed on a di verse range of hosts including cineraria, impatiens, New Guinea impatiens, coleus, hos ta, geranium, basil, and pepper. An unusual virus, tobacco rattle virus, was de tected on hostas that had recently been imported by a large grower from Europe. Slime flux and wetwood of elm and several spec ies of oak also occurred with greater- than-usual frequency this season. Dr. Douglas speculated these problems were associated with the unusual weather patterns and associated stresses. Tree and small fruit had a number of diseas e problems. These included black knot of plum and cherry, brown rot, powdery mildew , rusty spot, and perennial canker of peach, black rot, powdery mildew, and downy mild ew of grape, and Phomopsis canker and mummy berry of blueberry. Bacterial spot was unusually widespread and severe in 2005 and 2006 on many stone fruits, including peach, nectarine, apricot, and plum. These infections resulted in significant crop loss fo r several orchardists. X-disease was also observed on peaches and nectarines in nu merous locations throughout the state and appeared to be increasing in severity and prevalence in some orchards. Vegetables had their share of disease pr oblems as well. Noteworthy outbreaks of Septoria leaf spot on tomato and Vertici llium wilt of eggplant were reported. Downy mildew, angular leaf spot, and powdery mild ew were also diagnosed on many types of cucurbits. Bacterial diseases were prev alent throughout the state in commercial and backyard gardens. Identified by Dr. Douglas were bacterial spot and speck on tomatoes and bacterial spot on pepper. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Volutella blight of pachysandra was di agnosed with great frequency and caused significant problems and extensive dieback in es tablished plantings throughout the state. Symptoms developed in late summer and were prevalent ag ain this spring. Plants weakened by drought stress or those growing in marginal sites (e.g., full sun) appeared to be most susceptible to this fungus. Although diagnostic, concentric lesions were present on leaves, stem cankers posed the most importa nt problem since they resulted in sudden collapse of plants in large patches. Dr. Douglas worked with Drs. Victoria Smith and Robert Marra, CAES nursery inspectors, Jason Corwin (technician), a nd USDA-APHIS-PPQ personnel to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , in Connecticut. Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman are continuing to enhance the collection of cultures of Phytophthora species isolated from samples submitted to the Plant Disease Information Office for diagnosis. This collec tion will assist in work aimed at refining techniques used for dete cting various species of Phytophthora , including P. ramorum . Dr. Douglas' laboratory, Room 110, Jenkins Laboratory, was updated to fulfill the requirements to obtain USDA-APHIS-PPQ approval for \"Provisional Status for Ramorum Blight testing.\" Room 110 is part of a \"suite\" of laboratories that includes Rooms 11 and 12 in Jenkins Laboratory. Room 110 now has stereo and compound microscopes with digital cameras. In additi on, it has a Class II Type A biological safety cabinet for handling samples and cultures. Dr. Douglas using the new compound microscope with attached digital camera in her recently upgraded laboratory, Room 110, Jenkins Laboratory. As woodchip mulches become increasingl y common components of the landscape, inquiries about two curious f ungal problems have increased. Sphaerobolus stellatus , the artillery fungus, was once again diagnosed as the source of persiste nt brown to black spots on cars, house-siding, plants, and ot her surfaces during the 2005-2006 season. Slime molds, predominantly Fuligo septica , were also identified on many mulches. These types of fungi can drama tically appear overnight as large (up to 12-16 inches in diameter), brightly-colored masses. A lthough both problems are eye-catching, they are not plant pathogens. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 153 The unusually hot, humid, dry summer of 2005 caused significant drought stress and dieback of many lawns throughout the state. Damage began in June and continued into early September as cool season turfgrasse s went beyond their normal summer dormancy to completely dead. As a consequence of th ese stressful conditions of prolonged heat and high humidity, many weed and disease problems plagued lawns and golf greens. The key disease problems diagnosed by Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman were the patch diseases summer patch, Rhizoctonia brown patch, and necrotic ring spot, and anthracnose, especially the more atypical basal or crown rot stage of this disease. Nutsedge and crabgrass gained predominance in many lawn s by late summer, having taken advantage of the stressed cool season tu rfgrass species. Bentgrass wa s frequently identified as a common \"grassy\" weed in many home lawns. In spring 2006, the most prevalent disease was red thread because of the cool, wet conditions and the predominant weeds were annual bluegrass, ground ivy, henbit, and speedwell. Identification and control of Japanese bam boo continued to be a significant problem for many homeowners. Poison ivy remains a key plant of great public concern since it is widespread throughout the state. Impact: Information on the diseases that occu r on plants in Connecticut landscapes, natural woodlots, and forests each year help s to monitor and asse ss the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in detecting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. Seed Testing During 2006, the Bureau of Regulation and In spection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture submitted to Dr. Douglas 350 vegetable seed samples for germination analysis and 15 lawn grass seed samples fo r purity and germination analyses. Eleven vegetable seed samples did not meet germina tion claims. Eight samples were retested and failed the second test. Three samples we re not retested because of insufficient numbers of seeds. Of the 15 lawn seed sa mples tested, one met label claims for both purity and germination. Two samples failed la bel claims for both purity and germination. Nine samples passed label claims for germin ation but did not meet claims for purity. Three passed label claims for purity but did not meet claims for germination. Vegetable and lawn seed samples were also examined for prohibited noxious weed seeds and none of these samples contained weed contaminants. Impact: Germination and purity analyses are perfor med every year on official samples of vegetable, lawn, and crop seeds by The Connect icut Agricultural Experiment Station, the official seed testing labora tory for the state. The results of these tests provide Connecticut residents with information on the compliance of seeds sold within the state with the Connecticut Seed Law Regul ation and the Federal Seed Act. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and th e Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection: During this year, Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman examined 36 samples from the 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Connecticut Department of Consumer Protec tion at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. Meetings sponsored: January 24, 2006 . Wade Elmer was the CAES sponsor for the Bedding Plant meeting in Jones Auditorium. Approximately 30 growers were present. February 8, 2006 . Wade Elmer was the CAES spons or for a UCONN Extension outreach meeting for bedding plant growers in Ver non, CT. Approximately 35 growers were present. February 28, 2006 . Wade Elmer was the CAES sponsor for a UCONN Extension outreach meeting for bedding plant grower s in Torrington, CT. Approximately 30 growers were present. Wade Elmer organized and hosted 12 Lunch Club seminars by Station staff and outside speakers. Dr. Elmer participated in the West Hartfo rd Memorial Veteran Monument Ceremony by receiving and autoclaving foreign soils from battlefields around the world where American soldiers have died. Over 160 samples were processed and sprinkled onto the ground to consecrate the site. Citizen inquiries: Dr. Douglas, assisted by Ms. Inman, answered 6,855 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizen s: 12% dealt with food crops, 67% with ornamentals and trees, 6% with turf grasse s, and 15% were misc ellaneous questions. Twenty-four percent of the i nquiries were from commerci al growers and plant care professionals, 70% were from homeowners, a nd 6% were from cooperative extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 51% of the samples came in by phone, 11% came in by mail, 2% came as email (Connecticut only), and 36% we re brought in person. Dr. Douglas and Ms. Inman also sent over 900 letters and sent numerous email me ssages with attached files of fact sheets. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, iden tification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health an d environmental concerns. Dr. Anagnostakis responded to over 800 inquiries about chestnut blight, chestnut trees, and other nut trees. Dr. Elmer answered 13 inquiries dealing w ith plant problems on asparagus, basil, cyclamen, and pumpkins, and made 21 site visits to growers. In the past year, Dr. Marra processed 227 nursery samples for the 2006 National Survey and 4 nursery samples for the 2006 Trace Forward survey. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 155 DEPARTMENT OF SOIL AND WATER Mosquito Trapping and Testing Program. Mosquito surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (E EE) virus is integral to the public health response to these mosquito-transmitted viruse s in Connecticut. The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) ear ly evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, id entity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) baseline data that are used to assess the threat of WNV and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Drs. Theodore Andreadis and Ph ilip Armstrong (assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas, and Shannon Finan). Mosqu ito trapping is conducted at 91 permanent trapping stations that are located in 72 muni cipalities throughout the state. One-third of the sites are located in southern Fairfiel d and New Haven Counties where the highest rates of dead crow sightings have been cons istently observed and where the highest levels of WNV activity in mosquitoes and humans have been detected in previous years. In 2005, mosquito trapping was conducted from June 6 to October 20. Traps were set and attended by CAES staff every 10 days at each site on a regular rotation. Two trap types were used at all trappi ng stations - a CO2-ba ited CDC Light Trap, designed to trap host-seeking adult female mosquitoes (all species), and a Gravid Mosquito Trap, designed to trap previous ly blood-fed adult female mosquitoes (principally Culex and container breeding Ochlerotatus species). Elevated CO2-baited CDC Light Traps, placed approximately 7 m in the tree canopy, were additionally used at 12 sites in southern Fairfield and New Have n counties. Mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning where they were identified to species. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to species, co llecting site, and date and frozen at -80oC. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes were included in each pool. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of WNV and other mosquito-borne arboviruses of public health importance. Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for WNV, EEE, Jame stown Canyon (JC), Cache Valley (CV), Trivittatus (HJ), and LaCr osse (LAC), and Potosi (POTV) viruses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Ti me (TaqMan) PCR or standard RT-PCR using virus-specific primers, or by plaque reducti on neutralization (PRNT) . All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio-Safety Leve l 3 laboratory at the CAES. Weekly test results were reported to the CD C electronically via ArboNet and to the DPH for dissemination to other state agencies, lo cal health departments, the media, and neighboring states. During 2005, a total of 111,731 mosquitoes (9,840 pools) representing 33 species were trapped and tested. A total of 34 is olations of WNV were made from 5 species (Culex pipiens = 29, salinarius = 2, Culiseta melanura = 1, and Ochlerotatus triseriatus = 1), collected in 8 towns in 2 counties where WNV activity has been greatest in previous years: Fair field County (Bridgepor t, Danbury, Greenwich, Stamford, Stratford) and Ne w Haven County (Milford, New Haven, West Haven). The first positive pool of mosquito es was collected on July 11, a nd the last on October 5. Six human cases of WNV, of which five were loca lly acquired, were recorded in the State of Connecticut in 2005. 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Mosquito species trapped and tested for arboviruses in Connecticut, 2005 Virus Mosquito Species # Mosquitoes # Pools WN JC TVT 2 2411 CV = Cache Valley, LAC = LaCrosse, JC = Jamestown Canyon, TVT = Trivittatus, WN = West Nile Virus The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 157 Mosquito trapping stations showing West Nile virus positive sites in Connecticut, 2005 Mosquito Investigations. To evaluate the host-feeding patterns of the mosquitoes Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura as secondary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in northeastern United States, Drs. Theodore A ndreadis and Goudarz Molaei identified the source of vertebrate blood-meals by sequenci ng portions of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA. Analysis of PCR products from a total of 119 Ae. vexans , revealed that 92.4% of individuals acquired blood so lely from mammalian and 2.5% from avian hosts. Mixed-blood meals from both avian and mammalian hosts were detected in 5% of individuals of this species. Aedes vexans obtained vertebrate blood meals most frequently from white-tailed deer (80%) fo llowed by domestic horse, American Robin, eastern cottontail, and domestic cat. In contrast, Cs. melanura fed predominantly on avian species (89.6%), but exhibited some inclination for mammalian blood (4.2%). Individual mosquitoes containing mixed-bl ood meals were also identified in 6% of Cs. melanura . American Robin was the most co mmon source of vertebrate blood for Cs. melanura (23%), followed by Wood Thrush and Gray Catbird. American Crow represented only 2% of th e blood meals identified in Cs. melanura , as was similarly found with other recognized Culex vectors of WNV in the northeast. These findings support the view that Ae. vexans, is likely to be a relativel y important \"bridge vector\" to large mammals including deer and horse, while Cs. melanura likely plays a secondary role in enzootic transmission of WNV among free-ranging birds in more rural environs. 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 The risk of transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) to humans is associated with the density of infected vector mosquitoes in a given area. Current technology for estimating vector distribution and abundan ce is primarily based on CDC light trap collections, which provide only point data. In order to estimate mosquito abundance in areas not sampled by traps, Dr. Andreadis and colleagues from Yale University (Dr. M. A. Diuk-Wasser, H. Brown and Dr. D. Fish) deve loped logistic regression models for five mosquito species implicated as the most lik ely vectors of WNV in Connecticut. Using data from 32 traps in Fai rfield County from 2001 to 2003, the models were developed to predict high and low abundance for every 30x30m pixel in the County. They were then tested with an independent dataset fro m 16 traps in adjacent New Haven County. Environmental predictors of abundance were ex tracted from remotely sensed data. The best predictive models in cluded non-forested areas for Cx. pipiens , estuaries surface water and habitats for Cs. predictors were found for Cx. restuans . In Fairfield County, the final mode ls predicting high and low abundance correctly classified 75% of the traps melanura . In New Haven County, the models correctly classified 81.3% of the traps . County-wide continuous surface maps of habitat suitability were generated for each species, wh ich could contribute to future surveillance and intervention activities. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viru s perpetuates in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosqu ito vectors, principally Cs. melanura , and avian amplification hosts. To be tter understand the role of Cs. melanura and Cs. morsitans (Theobald) in the epizootiology of EEE virus, Drs. Andreadis, Molaei Armstrong along with colleagues from Cornell University and the NY State Department of Public Health (Drs. J. Oliver and J. Howard) collected blood -fed mosquitoes from two sites associated with an EEE virus focus in central NY and id entified the source of vertebrate blood by nucleotide sequencing of PCR products of the cytochrome b gene. Analysis of 484 Cs. melanura and 122 Cs. morsitans revealed that 94.2% and 86.9%, respectively, acquired blood solely from avian hosts. Blood meal s derived exclusively from mammals were detected in 0.8% of Cs. melanura and 1.6% of Cs. morsitans . Individual mosquitoes containing mixed-blood meals from both avian and mammalian hosts were also detected in 5.0% of Cs. melanura and 11.5% of Cs. morsitans . Wood Thrush constituted the most common vertebrate host for Cs. melanura (23.6%) and Cs. morsitans Vireo, and Common Yellowthroat. Mammalian-derived blood meal s were identified as white-tailed deer, horse, domestic cat, and eastern pipistrelle bat. There were three isolations of EEE virus from Cs. melanura and one from Cs. morsitans demonstrating active virus transmission when mosquitoes were sampled. These results suggest that Wood Thrush and a few other passerine birds may play key roles in suppor ting EEE virus transmission in the northeast and possibly throughout the geographic range of EEE in North America. The frequency of mammalian feedings also suggests that Cs. melanura and Cs. morsitans may play a role in the transmission of EEE virus to equi nes, in addition to maintaining enzootic transmission among avian hosts. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 159 Laboratory bioassays designe d to evaluate the infec tivity and pathogenicity of the baculovirus, OscoNPV (originally isolated from the mosquito, Oc. sollicitans in FL) were continued against larval mosquitoes by Dr. Theodore Andreadis (assisted by J. Shepard and M. Thomas). Five or ten larv al equivalents ( LE) with 5 mM Mg2+ added were used as a dosage rate in exposures with second and third instars at 20-24 0C. Infection rates were as follows: Oc. japonicus (18.0% LE and 48% @ 10 LE), Oc. atropalpus (66.0% @ 10 LE), and Cs. melanura (66.0% @ 10 LE). No infections were obtained in Cx. pipiens nor were infections found in any species in the absence of Mg2+. Development of the virus was observed in the nuclei of the midgut ep itheial cells in the gastric caeca and posterior region of the stomach. Exte nsive infections and high mortality were observed in Oc. japonicus and Oc. atropalpus, while comparatively light infections occurred in Cs. melanura. The host range of OscoNPV has now been extended to 10 species of Ochlerotatus, and 1 species each of Aedes and Culiseta . Arbovirus studies. Drs. Armstrong and Andreadis re ported the first isolation of La Crosse virus (LACV) from New Engla nd. In 2005, a bunyavirus that was isolated from a pool of eastern tree-hole mosquitoes, Ochlerotatus triseriatus collected from Fairfield, Connecticut (CT). Nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences from portions of the S, M and L segments were more similar to the prototype strain of LACV than that of closely related snowshoe hare virus. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the M segment indicated that the CT is olate represents a dist inct lineage of LACV, diverging earliest from other strains found in southeastern, centra l, and northeastern United States. Despite low sequence homology w ith other viral strains, the CT isolate was antigenically similar to the protot ype strain of LACV by plaque-reduction neutralization tests wi th poly- and monoclonal antibodies . This represents the first isolation of LACV in New England to our knowledge and suggests long-term independent evolution of the CT isolate. The phylogenetic relationships of eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEE) strains are currently being evaluated by Drs. Armstrong, Andreadis, Anderson, and Vossbrinck. Virus isolates obtained from the statewide mosquito trapping program during 1998-2004 were sequenced and analyzed to discer n patterns of evolu tionary change and lineage turnover from year-to-ye ar. Preliminary results indicate the following: 1) Diverse EEEV lineages may co-circulate in a given transmission season. For example, in 2003, 6 well-supported clades were detected re presenting 11 distinct sequence variants. Two distinct lineages co-circulated in 2000 a nd 2001 versus one identical strain in 1998. 2) There appears to be limited viral traffic between foci in the we stern and eastern parts of the state. Using the CT River Valley as a dividing line, diffe rent strains tend to circulate along an east-west axis. 3) The same strains do not reappear in successive years except for one from 2000-2001 and another fr om 2003-2004. This suggests that local over-wintering occurs in CT but on a limited basis. Most EEE strains are unique and probably arose from importation events. Long te rm persistence of th e same viral strain for more than two transmission seas ons was not supported by the data. Drs. Vossbrinck, Andreadis, Armstrong a nd Anderson (assisted by John Shepard) have completed sequencing of more than 396 WNV isolates from Connecticut. Results show a correlation between locati on and evolutionary relatedne ss. Isolates obtained from 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 mosquitoes are being recaptured in following ye ars. Some are identical with isolates obtained in previous years while others show nucleotide mu tations and changes to their protein structure. The recapture of isolat es from previous years provides good evidence that the virus is over wintering in Connecticut. Analysis in th e current year will look for convergent changes in the viral protein that is the same muta tion in an unrelated isolate, to see if the virus is possibly adapting to the new bird hosts or mosquito vectors found in North America. Controlling Exotic Invasive W eeds in Connecticut Lakes (Dr. Jason White, Gregory Bugbee, Dr. Robert Capers, assisted by Roslyn Selsky) Surveillance and Monitoring Program. A second full season of monitoring and surveillance for invasive aquatic weeds in CT lakes was completed. A total of 104 lakes have been mapped for aquatic vegetation; 62 in this last year. GPS-based bathymetric vegetation maps were created and digitized, along with text-based narratives. All information is currently being incorporated into the Invasive Aquatic Plant Program website as part of the CAES web page. As anticipated, more than two thirds of the surveyed water bodies have been invaded by non-native plants; in fact, most lakes contained multiple invasive species. The mo st commonly found inva sive plants were curly Samples of all species from all su rveyed lakes are being archived in herbaria collections at CAES and the University of Connecticut. The monitoring and surveillance program has scien tifically confirmed anecdotal and historical data; clearly invasive aquatic plant species are both presen t and problematic in a large number of CT water bodies. Control efforts. A central goal of this program ha s been to experiment with novel methods of control so as to restore native plant communities to aquatic ecosystems as they existed prior to invasion by non-native speci es. We have several long-term research projects that are summarized below: Bashan Lake, East Haddam, CT. Water milfoil is an invasive aquatic plant that can restrict the recreational use of lakes and eliminate desirable native aquatic plants. Since 1994, the Station has been monitoring th e milfoil problem in Bashan Lake, East Haddam. The Connecticut Department of E nvironmental Protection (CTDEP), the town of East Haddam and the Bashan Lake Associ ation have supplied the Station grants to study the use of the herbicide 2,4-D for controllin g the milfoil. Greg Bugbee and Jason White have met with lake association, CTDEP and town officials to educate the public on the project and obtain the necessary permits. In 2000 - 2005 areas of Bashan Lake were treated with 2,4-D (2,4-D ester). Although c ontrol was generally very good re-growth occurred in some areas and new areas of milf oil were found particularly in water from 10 - 20 feet deep. Tests in 2001- 2004 have discovered that a late summer application of 2,4-D is likely more effective th an the traditional spring trea tments and the rate can be reduced from 200 lbs/acre to 75 - 100 lbs/acre with equally good cont rol. Areas treated The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 161 with 2,4-D usually stay nearly milfoil free for at least two years. Re infestation is thought to occur either by uncontrolled remnants of previous plants or rooting of plant fragments from untreated portions of the lake. New unde rwater video equipment has allowed CAES to accurately assess where milfoil is occurring document large areas of milfoil that were previously unkown. This milfo il could be the source of plant fragments. In September 2005, 2,4-D was applied to 45 acres of milfo il between the outlet dam launch and the Sunset Acres dock. Other areas, totaling five acres, including portions of the boat launch cove, Brooks Cove, and Laurel Cove were al so treated. Late fall and spring surveys indicated excellent control. Nearby groundwater wells are tested and no 2,4-D has been found. It is hoped that herbic ide applications can gradua lly be reduced. Effective development of late season herb icide application approaches are highly desirable because of the low lake usage by stakeh olders during the early weeds cabomba and Eurasian water milfoil. In 2001, the herbicide Sonar SRP (fluridone, slow release pellets) was applied to two acres of cab omba in the cove near the boat launch with excellent control. This was the first known successful control cabomba with a granular herbicide applied as a spot treatment. In 2002, this area was monitored for regrowth and a total of 122 plants were found and removed by hand pulling. Many of these plants had likely come from fragments floating in from other parts of the lake and taking root. Regrowth of cabomba in the north cove continued through 2005, and cabomba has become a problem again. Retreatment scheduled for 2005 was delayed by CTDEP until the proximity of an endangered plant called water marigold could be detailed. Aquatic vegetation was mapped. Georefer enced locations of water marigold supplied to CTDEP by CAES have allowed treatment of the north cove in 2006. In the southern cove, a 2000 X 50 ft. area of lily pads and other nuisan ce vegetation was treated with glyphosate in September 2002. Three weeks later, the ar ea was then hydroraked and the collected vegetation was removed. In April 2004, the hy droraking was performed again to remove floating islands of muck and dead aquatic vegetation. A spring survey found large areas of cabomba in the treated area. Two treatments of fluridone Q (quick release) were applied in June 2004. Aquatic plant surv eys were performed along GPS referenced transects in 2004 and 2005 to monitor conditi ons before and after treatment. These surveys found the quick release Sonar provide d too little residual activity and regrowth occurred by late summer 2004 and proceeded further in 2005. Water samples were routinely tested for temperature, di ssolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, phosphorus, and fluridone. Grannis Lake, East Haven, CT . The effectiveness of th e aquatic herbicides fluridone and Diquat in controlling Eurasi an milfoil, sago pondweed, curly leaf pondweed and coontail are being tested in Gran nis Lake. Grannis Lake was surveyed for aquatic vegetation prior to the initial treatment and again each spring thereafter. North/South transects were made at 100 feet intervals using GPS. Vegetation samples were obtained at 50 ft. intervals, identifie d, judged for abundance and then brought back to the lab to obtain dry we ight. Diquat was applied in May 2005 and fluridone was applied in split applications throughout the summer 2005 to maintain concentrations of 10 -20 ppb. Water was tested each week to de termine fluridone concentrations. By late May the diquat had eliminated all Eurasian milfoil, coontail, Sago pondweed, and curly 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 leaf pondweed. The fluridone application preven ted any regrowth of these plants for the remainder of 2005. In spring 2006, transects we re again surveyed and only curly leaf pondweed and a small amount of Sago pondweed was found. The Diquat /fluridone treatments were determined ineffective fo r curly leaf pondweed control probably because the plant set reproductive structur es called turions prior to th e application of the Diquat. Water samples are periodically tested for temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, phosphorus and fluridone. Molecular studies . After a preliminary st udy in the 2004, a full line of investigation was opened on the identifica tion of aquatic plants through molecular (DNA/RNA) techniques. The motivation for this research is the difficulty in identifying many plants of interest, including both inva sive and threatened species. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck (assisted by Kirsten Deeds) ha s joined the project and has developed procedures for isolation of DNA from aqua tic plants. Using the isolated DNA, three genes (small ribosomal subunit, internal tr anscribed spacer ribosomal DNA, intergenic each plant have been amplified and sequenced. Sequences of 24 plants have been determined and a database for molecula r analysis between genera and species is being constructed. The successful implemen tation of a molecular-based identification system will significantly increase the accuracy of vegetation surveys in CT Lakes. Outreach efforts. Given the magnitude of invasi on by non-native aquatic plants, we are making significant effo rts to engage citizens, la ke associations, and other stakeholders as part of this project. CAES scientists organized three workshops on the identification of invasive aquatic plants th is year. Our web site gives details on the CAES Invasive Aquatic Plant Program, including a full description of the research goals and a complete presentation of the project results ( http://www.caes.state.ct.us/ AquaticPlants/index.htm .). Included are all publications in downloadable PDF formats, as well as the digitized maps of all surveyed lakes. Successfully e ducating and engaging stakeholders is critical to th e success of CAES efforts at ma naging invasive aquatic plants in CT waters. Phytoremediation of persistent organic pollutants: Studies were conducted by Dr. Jason White in an ongoing investigation of the potential of certain vegetation to remove moderately low levels of persistent organic pollutants from soil. Previous data had indicated that Cucurbita pepo cultivars seemed to have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathered resi dues but that significant cr op variability may exist down to the species or even subspecies level. Studies were conducted under several different lines of investigati on in the past year: (1.) In a greenhouse rhizotron study, th ree cucurbits (zu cchini, non-zucchini summer squash, and a cucumber) were grown in a soil contaminated with weathered residues of several persis tent organic pollutants (P OPs)(chlordane, DDE/DDD/DDT, PAHs). Movement of contaminants was studi ed by comparing concentrations in the bulk soil, rhizosphere pore water, xylem sap, and ae rial tissues. This enabled calculation of BCFs or bioconcentration factors from the so il pore water to the xylem sap. BCFs for chlordane varied somewhat among the differe nt cucurbits; 36, 40, and 23 for zucchini, squash, and cucumber respectively. Inte restingly, for the DDE/DDD/DDTs, the BCFs The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 163 were 19, 4, and 8 for the zucchini, squash, and cucumber. For PAHs, bioaccumulation was highly variable but related to the number of rings. Th ese data show, for the first time, that the accumulation of weathered POPs is not only highly dependent on the phylogeny of the plant but also on the physicoc hemical properties of the contaminants. (2.) Field experiments were conducted to assess the impact of inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi on the accumulation of weathered p,p'-DDE from soil were inoculated into the root system of the zucchini seedlings at plan ting. Plants not inoculated with fungi accumulated large but variable amounts of c ontaminant, with root BCFs ranging from 10- 48 and stem BCFs ranging from 5.5-11. The to tal amount of contaminant phytoextracted ranged from 0.72-2.9%. The effect of f ungal inoculation on contaminant uptake appeared to vary at the cultivar level. For Goldrush, fungal inoculation generally decreased tissue BCFs but because of slightly la rger biomass, did not significantly impact the percent enhanced p,p'-DDE accumulation from soil, and increased the amount of contaminant phytoextracted by up to 34% . increased contaminant phytoextraction by 53 and 60%, respectively. The data show that f ungal inoculation may si gnificantly increase the remedial potential pepo ssp pepo although the apparent cultivar specific response to mycorrhizal inoculati on is unexpected and problematic. (3.) Field experiments were conduc ted to assess the impact of surfactant amendment on the accumulation of weathered p,p'-DDE from soil spp pepo ). Four different surfacta nts were added at one of three concentrations (100 mg/L, 500 mg/L , 1000 mg/L) prior to zucchini seedling planting in the field. Two synthetic/industria l surfactants (Triton X-100, Tween-80) for all amendmen ts cyclodextrin, surfactants significantly increased the release of weathered DDE. However, the effect of surfactant amendment on zucchini's ability to accumulate DDE was cu ltivar specific. For one cultivar, all surfactants at all concentrations signifi cantly decreased contaminant uptake. Alternatively, Triton X-100 increased the DDE phytoextraction of cultivar by 450% and yielded nearly 5% contaminant remova l from soil. In addition, several of the surfactants at higher concentra tions clearly reduced plant biomass. The data show that under the appropriate conditions, surfactan t amendment may dramatically increase contaminant uptake but the conditions of successful treatment remain unknown. (4.) In ongoing collaborativ e investigations with Dr. Jason Kelsey of Muhlenburg College, small pot studies were designed to compare the upta ke of weathered DDE from both contaminated soil and compost. When tw o cucurbit species were grown in soil and compost containing weathered DDE residues at approximately the same concentration, dramatically different pollutant levels we re found in the plants. On average, DDE appears to be 7-8 times more available in soil than in compost. However, if one expresses the amount of contaminant in the soil and compost on an organic carbon normalized basis, the differences disappear; this is due to the fact that the compost organic carbon content is 8-10 times greater than that of the soil. The bioavailability of 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 weathered persistent organic pollutants to plants in compost is significantly less than that of a similarly contaminated soil. Bioavailability of persistent or ganic pollutants to earthworms: In further collaborative investigations with Dr. Jason Kelsey of Muhlenburg College, the influence of four separate surfacta nts (each at three concentr ations; 100, 500, and 1000 mg/L) on were used. For both worm species, all surfactants at all concentrations significantl y increased DDE levels in the tissues. On average, the increases in contaminant burde n were 2 to 6-fold, although Tween-80 at all concentrations increased the contaminant level in L. terrestris by more than 70-fold. Eathworm species appear to be much more se nsitive receptors than are plants relative to the surfactant-enhanced bioavailability of w eathered persistent orga nic pollutants. The bioavailability of weathered DDE in both so il and compost was al so assessed for two separate species of earthworm ( Eisenia foetida, Lumbricus terrestris above, the bioava ilability of DDE in soil is significantly greater to both species than when the contaminant is present in compost; 7.7-fold for E. foetida and 3.4-fold for L. terrestris . However, if one expresse s the soil concentration on an organic carbon basis, the avai lability of DDE is actually greater when in compost. The bioavailability of weathered persistent organic pollu tants to earthworms in compost is significantly less than that of a similarly contaminated soil. An Isotope Exchange Technique to Ver ify True Sorption Hysteresis and Assess Mechanism. (Drs. Joseph Pignatello and Michae l Sander). The sorption of organic compounds to natural sorbents often shows hysteresis, or non -coincidence of the sorption and desorption branches of the isotherm. Th e objective of this study was to develop an experimental technique based on the use of 14C isotopes to distinguish hysteresis due to experimental artifacts from true hysteresi s due to thermodynamically irreversible processes. The study was also designed to investigate causation of true hysteresis (irreversible sorption). The technique determ ines the rates and the degree of isotope exchange (IE) on equilibrated sorption and deso rption points at differe nt constant bulk chemical concentrations. The technique wa s applied to the sorption of naphthalene (NAPH) on Beulah-Zap lignite, a low rank reference coal co mposed mainly of kerogen. Sorption of bulk was found to be reversible below 10-5 g L-1, but hysteretic above 10-4 g L-1. Complete isotope exchange on sorption and desorption points that defined an irreversible cycle demonstrated that hyste resis was true. A comparison of normalized uptake and release kinetics of label and bulk NAPH at differe nt concentrations revealed slow structural deformation processes of th e sorbent during bulk sorption and desorption. This is taken as corroborating evidence for the pore deformation hypothesis of hysteresis in which incoming sorbate molecules induce quasi-reversible changes in the organic matter that lead to different pathways fo r sorption and desorpti on. Although unable to rule it out completely, the data demonstrat es that physical entrapment of sorbate molecules plays a minor, if any, role to the observed hysteresis in this system. The study validates true hysteresis in natural organi c matter and shows that it results from irreversible deformation of the solid during a sorption desorption cycle. This finding is The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 165 likely to alter the paradigm of sorption, whic h will have important impacts on transport models of chemicals in soil and sediments. Conditioning Annealing Studies of Natura l Organic Matter Solids Linking Irreversible Sorption to Irr eversible Structural Expansion. (Drs. Joseph Pignatello, Michael Sander, Yuefeng Lu). The assumpti on of reversibility underpins the sorption term in current models dealing with the fate and impact of organic compounds in the environment, yet experimentally sorption of organic compounds in soils and sediments often shows 'irreversible' be haviors such as hysteresis and the conditioning effect (enhanced repeat sorption). The objective of this study was to test whether a glassy polymer irreversibility model applies to natural organic ma tter (NOM) solids. Irreversible sorption in polymers is believed to be cause d by irreversible expa nsion and creation of internal micropores by penetrating molecules, leading to increased affinity for the adsorbate during desorption or subsequent re-sorption. Using chlorobenzene as a conditioning agent and polychlorinated benzen es as test compounds in a second sorption step, we observed conditioning effects for a peat soil, a soil humic acid, and a model glassy polymer, poly(vinylchloride), but not for a model rubbery polymer, poly(ethylene). The conditioning effect for the two natural solids, probed by the enhancement in the sorption distribution coefficient of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, relaxed upon sample annealing between 45 oC and 91 oC in a manner similar to the relaxation of free volume and enthalpy of glassy polymers. Relaxation of the conditi oning effect in the NOM solids depended on annealing temperatur e and, at a given temperature, followed a double additive exponential rate law with a non- zero constant term descriptive of the final state that depends i nversely on temperature. At environmentally relevant temperatures, the conditioning effect may \"n ever\" completely relax. The results provide compelling evidence for the glassy, non-equilib rium nature of natural organic matter solids and for irreversible st ructural expansion as a cause of irreversible sorption. Effect of Natural Organic Substances on the Surface and Adsorptive Properties of Environmental Black Carbon. (Drs. Soukjoon Kwon and Joseph Pignatello). Black carbon (BC; char and soot) particles emitted to the environment typically are formed with high microporosity and surface area properties that are responsible for their presumed important role in adsorption of anthropogenic organic chemicals in soils and sediments. An issue that has received little direct atten tion is the possibility that naturally-occurring organic matter attenuates the surface activity of BC. We found that simulated \"aging\" of prepared wood char particles in a soil-water suspension leads to a strong decline in char total surface area (TSA) determined by the customary method of N 2 adsorption at 77 K using the B.E.T. equation, and a more modest d ecline in the affinity of char for dissolved benzene. To help determine underlying cause , we measured the effects of adsorbed natural lipids or lipid fractions of humi c substances, modeled by triglycerides of a commercial vegetable oil. With increasing li pid loading (up to 40% by char weight) from aqueous mixtures, N 2-TSA was strongly suppressed (up to 100-fold), while CO 2 cumulative surface area (CSA, 0-1.4 nm) at 273K and benzene adsorption at 293K were hardly affected. In a ddition, the rate of CO 2 adsorption was retarded. We propose that externally adsorbed lipid molecules occ upy pore throats with access to interior pore networks. At 77 K, as opposed to the higher te mperatures, lipid chains are too inflexible 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 to allow passage of adsorbate. It is c oncluded that benzene adsorption to char predominates at interior pore si tes and does not correlate with N 2-probed micropore properties when the char accrues pore-bloc king substances from the surroundings. The findings indicate that N 2 may not be suitable for pr obing hydrophobic microporosity in BC materials present in soils and sediments. Concentration-Dependent Multi-Term Line ar Free Energy Relationship for Sorption of Organic Compounds to Soils. (Drs. Dongqiang Zhu and Joseph Pignatello). A LFER of the type in the title is applied to sorp tion of numerous compounds to polyethylene and three soils for which sorption to natural orga nic matter (NOM) is pr esumed dominant. It provides fractional contributions to the Gibbs free energy of sorption corresponding to hydrophobic effects, dipolar/polarizability (D/P) effects in excess of the reference state, and the sum of possible specific forces such as H-bonding and - electron donor- acceptor ( - EDA) interactions in excess of the re ference state. Minimal inputs are the isotherm, the n-hexadecane-water partition co efficient and the Abraham i parameter representing D/P effects. Sorption of all co mpounds to polyethylene can be described by considering only hydrophobic effects. Sorption of a calibration set of and aliphatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocar bons) the by a combina tion of hydrophobic and D/ P D/P sorp tion free for D/P effects increase with the degr ee of chlorination for ali phatic compounds. For aromatic compounds D/P effects increase with fused ring size but do not vary with degree of chlorination and chlorine substitution patte rn. H-bonding contribute s substantially to sorption of alcohols, and similarly for 2-nonanol and 2,4-dichlorophenol (33%-44%). - EDA forces contribute to phenanthrene so rption in one case. The effects of concentration, aromaticity NMR), and sorbent polarity [(O+N)/C] D/P contributions for all compounds indicate that: a) molecules fill sites of progressively greater hydrophi lic character; b) the energy penalty for cavity formation in the solid decreases with concentration due to plasticization and greater intermolecular contact; c) sorbent aromatic content more than sorbent polarity controls D/P interactions. Basing free energy on an inert electrostatic chemical environment afforded by n- hexadecane permits evaluation of direct electrostatic forces in NOM that contribute to sorption. The LFER gives valuable informa tion on the driving forces affecting sorption with respect to chemical stru cture, concentration of chemi cal in solution, and soil organic matter properties. Nonlinear and Competitive Sorption of Apolar Compounds in Black Carbon-Free Natural Organic Materials. (Drs. Joseph J. Pignatello, Yuefeng Lu, Eugene J. LeBoeuf, Weilin Huang, J Song and Baoshan Xing- Univer sity of Massachusetts). Many studies have reported a spectrum of sorption phenomen a in soils, sediments, and organic matter isolates of those materials that are inconsiste nt with a partition mode l proposed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a model based on the hypot hesis that sorption is linear and non- competitive. To explain these nonideal phenomena prior studies have proposed a hard/soft (glassy/rubbery) mode l for soil/sediment organic matter (SOM), while others have recently attributed them singularly to black carbon (soot a nd charcoal) particles present in topsoils and sediments. In this study, we demonstrated nonideal sorption The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 167 behavior (isotherm nonlinearity, competitive eff ects) for a group of apolar compounds in a large set of natural and model organic ma terials, including a commercial lignin and humic acids from different sources. Complete oxidation of samples by an acid dichromate method was taken to signify the absence of black carbon. (However, polymethylene units are stable even if func tionalized on both ends, making the technique unreliable for quantifying black carbon.) Other samples were inferred free of black carbon by their source and method of preparation. Characteriz ation by thermalanalytical methods indicated the glassy character of th e organic materials. The origin of the nonideal behaviors appears to be the glassy character of these materials. Sorption nonlinearity increased or decreased by changi ng the temperature, co-solvent content, and by cross-linking with metal ions as predicted for organic solids in a glassy state. We conclude that macromolecular humic substanc es in the environmen t may exhibit nonideal sorption behavior in soils and sediments, quite apart from any such behaviors attributable to black carbon. Soil Testing: Testing soil samples for fertilit y and suggesting methods for growing better plants are a continuing service for citizen s of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Mr. Bugbee tested 5,807 sample s and answered 1,996 inquiries. VALLEY LABORATORY RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 42 experiment al plots during the past year at the Windsor farm. Five Windsor-based scien tists had 27 of these plots; six New Haven- based scientists were using the remaining 15 plots. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields and State forests. Richard Horvath kept the farm and his equipmen t ready and in excellent shape. With the help of Nick Sikorski and Matthew Deltendr e, Richard expertly maintained the many field plots and addressed the specific need s of each scientist. He and his summer assistants did an outstanding job maintain ing the extensive ornamental garden in cooperation with Rose Hiskes and the Connecticut Nurser y and Landscape Association. Mr. Horvath and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agri cultural Pesticides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Exotic insect pests of hemlock Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae , is an introduced insect pest from Asia, which continues to threaten the health and distribution of native eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis and Carolina hemlock, Tsuga caroliniana on both the forest and urban landscapes in 16 eastern states from Georgia to Maine. Recent winters have been less severe, and the potential for majo r resurgence of HWA in Connecticut and the rest of New England has been widely antic ipated. Biological c ontrol, in a national program supported by the USDA Forest Servi ce, remains a major tool for forest 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 management of HWA infestations. Conn ecticut, via the Conn ecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, was the first state in the US to release and study biological control of HWA using a tiny Japanese ladybeetle, Sasajiscymnus (formerly Pseudoscymnus ) tsugae. This program, now funded almost entirely by th e USDA Forest Service, is now in its 12th year of research, predator releases and evalua tions but its continued vi ability is threatened by recent federal funding cuts. Dr. Cheah cont inues to direct a 3-part project, funded by the USDA Forest Service, to improve the implementation and assessment of biological control of HWA by imported coccinellid predators. The first project involves e nhancing biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid through the development of artif icial diets for mass rearing of ladybeetle predators. Several introduced predator sp ecies from Japan, China and the Pacific North-West are currently being reared in the south by several state-supported, or private insectaries for deployment in the HWA-infested states as a part of the national biological control program supported by the USDA Forest Service. The mass rearing of S. tsugae and other imported predators is completely dependent on extensive collections of healthy, heavily infested hemlock foliage, primarily collected and shipped from the infested areas of North Carolina. The availability of infested foliage is seasonal and can be unpredictable. This dependence on natural prey collections and the necessity for labor-intensive techniques has placed numerical limitations on the large-scale pr oduction of specialist predators for adelgid control. Dr. Cheah, in collaboration with Dr . Allen Cohen, Insect Diet and Rearing Institute, Tucs on, Arizona, continued with arti ficial diet investigations at the Valley Laboratory, for ma intaining and/or mass rearing Sasajiscymnus tsugae , an introduced predator for biological control of he mlock woolly adelgid. After the testing of 60 formulations in feeding and survival bioassays, a freeze dried formulation of Dr. Cohen's, derived from chicken egg extracts ha s proved to be palatable to both adults and larvae but requires frequent cha nges (every 2-3 d) to attract feeding. In long-term trials in 2005 and 2006, adult survival at room temp eratures of 20-22 \u00baC was 79% for females and 41.2% for males supported on diet alone for 9 weeks. The rapid development of mold on the exposed diet was a major contributor to increased levels of adult mortality. However, some adults were still alive after 13 weeks of feeding on diet alone. Surviving adults were vigorous and able to mate and ovi posit within a few days of being placed on adelgid-infested hemlock as an oviposition stimulus. Fecundity has been high, weekly oviposition patterns have been normal, and long evity enhanced. This indicates that the diet formulation is nutritionally complete a nd able to support full re productive capacity of adult S. tsugae deprived of its natural prey for ove r 3 months. The current challenges are directed towards improving the shelf-life of the diet by decreasing mold, desiccation and modification of the diet packaging to enable feeding by larvae. The development of a suitable artificial diet for adelgid predator s and a complementary labor-saving delivery system would enable the amp lification of mass rearing of predators with significant implications on the economics and efficacy of the national program. Of equal importance would be the development of an artificial diet for maintaining colonies of predators in the event of a shortage of HWA. The second project involves the developm ent of improved assessments of hemlock health, monitoring for S. tsugae impact, establishment, dispersal and survival. Biological control with S. tsugae began in Connecticut and the majority of S. tsugae release sites were implemented in th e mid-late 1990s when HWA had reached a The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 169 zenith and all towns in Connecticut repor ted infestations a nd tree decline. S. tsugae available for release against HWA are reared in state at the Valley Laboratory in Windsor. Around 174,000 S. tsugae have been released at 25 forest and urban sites in Connecticut from 1995-2006. In 2006, over 3,700 S. tsugae were reared for release at the Valley Laboratory with the assistance of Ja mes Preste, with over 2,700 released at 3 new sites in central, north eastern and southern Connecticut. The 2006 winter was much less severe, and assessments of HWA winter mortal ity at 15 sites recorded great variation in HWA mortality in central and northern regi ons while HWA mortality was least in the coastal sections. Overall HWA winter mortality in 2006 in Connecticut was 61%, ranging from 44.2% at southern co astal sections to 70% in no rthern and central stands. As new infestations continue to reappear with current warming climatic trends, there is an urgent need in Connecticut for the continuation of predator re leases, but this is challenged concurrently by inadequate funding for the program. At 5-11 years since release, the majority of the Connecticut sites represent the oldest S. tsugae sites in the U.S, in addition to constituting a unique large scale field experiment involving a single predator species re lease. Dr. Cheah, with the assistance of James Preste, continued summer assessments of hemlock health in 16 S. tsugae release sites. In 2005, S. tsugae release sites conti nued to show recovery across all types of woodland suitability sites w ith high levels of new shoot production and reduced HWA crown levels. Hemlock recovery was still evid ent even in the poorest of hemlock habitats composed of rocky outcrops with very thin droughty soils. The recovery of hemlocks occurred statewide in both release and non-re lease stands and was correlated with optimal cool moist growing seasons and concurrent heavy winter mortality of adelgids in 2003 and 2004. No increased hemlock mortality in release sites was reco rded. During the fall and winter of 2005, Dr. Cheah and James Pr este located topographically matching non- release sites within a few miles of S. tsugae release sites and a ssessed the health of hemlocks for comparisons to established releas e sites. All non-rel ease matching sites had been or were currently infested with HWA. In addition, baseline sites, which comprised northern natural hemlock stands which were not infested with e ither HWA or elongate hemlock scale, were also located and rated to provide a standard for hemlock health under the influence of normal abiotic stressor s such as drought etc. The results were indisputable: hemlocks in release sites, wh ich had previously suffered heavy dieback and decline, had now developed significantly health ier crowns than in non-release sites. The hemlock crowns in release sites were not signi ficantly different from hemlock crowns in baseline sites, indicating an enhanced level of recovery. Predator recoveries through current sampling of the lower canopy remain inefficient. However, an adult S. tsugae was recovered through foliage inspection in a northern site with very low le vels of HWA, 6 years after re lease, showing the persistence of the species. Overwintering studies in 2006 of S. tsugae adults in large field cages in northern and southern sites provi ded insight into the impact of Connecticut winters on the predator. The winter of 2006 was considered above normal in mean winter temperature although a cold snap occurred early in mid- December 2005. Survival and recovery of S. tsugae was minimal in Norfolk, in northwester n Connecticut, where HWA mortality was around 91% and S. tsugae survival on large caged br anches was only 7.1% where the minimum winter temperature in Norfolk dr opped to -4.4 \u00baF in mid-December 2005. In Windsor, the survival of S. tsugae was much improved at 73.5 % where the minimum 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 winter temperature dropped to 1.97 \u00baF. Recovery of survivors from other large tent cages in other sites enclosing hemlock tr unk sections and foliage was poor. Releases of S. tsugae into previously heavily infest ed stands in Connecticut, in conjunction with weather events such as the impact of recent severe winters and wet, cool growing seasons, have resulted in the greater recovery of hemlocks previously in decline. This continued recovery of previously dec lining hemlock stands in Connecticut is the first to be documented in eastern states th at have been under HWA siege since the early 1990s. The efficacy of the biological control program using S. tsugae in Connecticut continues to be justified. R ecent data suggest that reintroduc tions of the predator should become a key component of the biological control program due to variable winter mortality of the predator. The third project has a goal of enhanci ng biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid through the developmen t of effective mass reari ng procedures for exotic predators. Dr. Cheah, with the assistance of USDA Forest Service technicians Paul Moore, Gregg Bradford and Cuyler Remick, has re-established the original stressed US laboratory colonies and improved mass re aring techniques for 2 other introduced coccinellid species from high mountainous regions in southwestern China, Scymnus sinuanodulus and Scymnus ningshanensis . Successful small-scale Scymnus species were developed by Dr. Cheah and her team at the Insect Rearing Facility of the Northeastern Research St ation in Hamden, CT, based on the species' preferences for cooler temperatur es for oviposition. Production of S. sinuanodulus in 2005 and 2006 was greatly improved by oviposition at 12 \u00b0C, which prolonged the oviposition period, and subsequent transfer of the eggs to ac celerate and complete larval development to adult at 20 \u00b0C. This method has proved successful for both species and this rearing technology, together with another 500 adults of S. sinuanodulus , were transferred to the primary HWA predator mass rearing facility, the Philip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory, New Jersey Department of Agri culture, to facilitate mass rearing for releases in other states. St udies from 2004-2006 have also shown that S. ningshanensis does not exhibit peak reproductive ability until the s econd year after emergence, in spite of the provision of optim al densities of hea lthy adelgids, photoperiod and temperature. In 2006, around 3,000 S. ningshanensis were successfully reared in Hamden, re-establishing a healthy colony. S. sinuanodulus are reproductive in the year following their emergence and 1,080 adults were released in an ad joining area of the Centennial Watershed State Forest in Weston, to augmen t a 2005 release. Another 1,057 S. sinuanodulus were also sent for release in sout hern Pennsylvania, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservati on and Natural Resources. In addition, Dr. Cheah has also directed the quarantine inves tigations and evaluations of new species of coccinellids collected from expanded foreign e xploration in China, which were initiated in April 2005 under the biological control initiative. In 2005 , 2 new coccinellid species were collected and imported into the US DA FS quarantine laboratory in Ansonia, Scymnus geminus and Scymnus (Pullus) huashanshong but neither showed a strong oviposition response to HWA at different temperatures and survival was limited on HWA. These species do not appear to be vi able candidates for HWA biological control. Shipments from explorations in Japan and China in 2006 have also not yielded any numbers of promising new candidates. Pr ogress was also made toward identifying temperature treatments aimed at reducing the extended duration of egg diapause in a third The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 171 species, Scymnus camptodromus . Improving the viability and productivity of imported Scymnus predator colonies resulting in transf ers to other mass rearing insectaries has fulfilled an important objective of the national HWA biological control strategy of the USDA Forest Service. Investigations of new species of coccinellids from Asia for potential biological control of HWA under quarantine laboratory conditions are also integral to research aimed towards establishi ng a complex of introduced HWA predators. Major accomplishments of the HWA research program include: First to document the recovery of eastern hemlocks statewide, especially in previously heavily damaged, adelgid-infest ed stands where biological control has been implemented In collaboration with Dr. Allen Cohen, have identified an artificial diet which has the potential to stabilize adult colonies of S. tsugae in the absence of HWA Revived Scymnus predator colonies for biolog ical control implementation and improved collaboration and ties with th e USDA Forest Service Northeastern Research Station in Hamden, CT Nursery Integrated Pest Management Tim Abbey continues to work with co mmercial nursery growers, and other ornamental plant industries, to promote th e adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) practices. During the 2005 field season, th ree nurseries received intensive on-site assistance with establishment of IPM progr ams. Pesticide usage records from the cooperative year, in this case 2005, are compar ed to the year designated as pre-IPM adoption. Overall, insecticide/miticide usage decreased by 4.4 pounds of product. Total active ingredient applied decr eased by 6.2 pounds. This translat ed into a decrease of $57 for insecticide products. (Product and active ingredient results calculated from two grower participants, cost information was from one.) Along with the detailed analysis of the pesticide spray records, participants were asked to complete a post-season questionnaire that allows them to review their collaboration with Mr. Abbey. The Nursery IPM program was rated as \"Excelle nt\" (2) and \"Good\" (1). All of the participants stated that they would re commend the program to other Connecticut nurseries. The life history study of the rhododendron leafminer ( Lyonetia latistrigella ) by Tim Abbey was extended into 2005 at a model container nursery. Forty-one hoop houses were selected in the nursery. Areas (approxi mately 250 sq.ft.) were marked with flagging tape at both ends and the middle of each house. The Rhododendron sp. in these areas were monitored on a weekly basis from late April through September. Infested leaves were counted and removed each week. The routine monitoring documented the date and location that this pest first appeared in the nursery, along with the corresponding growing degree days. Insecticide applications were appl ied to target specific insect life stages and areas of rhododendrons rather than cover sp rays to entire blocks of plants. The hypothesis that early detection and targeted insecticide treatments will stop a major rhododendron leafminer infestation, and thus, decrease overall insecticide applications, appears to be accurate. There was minima l damage at the end of the 2005 growing 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 season, but more than at the end of 2004. To finalize the project, a more focused monitoring of select areas, along with observations of infested plants in an enclosed cage; will continue in 2006. At this time in 2006, no damaging leafminer population has been detected. Strawberry breeding: Dr. Richard Cowles continues to make selections for strawberries bred for tolerance to black vine weevil and black root rot. Plants that have passed rigorous selection for th ese traits are being propagate d to assess overall fruit quality and yield characteristic s. The best hybrids may be tested in growers' fields in 2007 and 2008. Christmas tree insect pest management: Field research trials continue to fine- tune chemical control of pales weevils, el ongate c onifer root balsam twig aphid in Christmas tree plan tations. The 2005 experiments conducted by Dr. Cowles determined that very early sp ray timing is essential for minimizing the reproduction of pales weevils in Christmas tr ee stumps. This year's experiment is designed to optimize the combination of bifent hrin and carbaryl insecticide combination to achieve resistance management and rapid knock down of adults at the lowest cost. Effective chemical options for elongate heml ock scale control were identified in 2005. However, each of the options has drawback s with respect to cost, difficulty in application, or harm to beneficial predator s or parasites. This year's trials are investigating use of products that should have minimal impa ct on these beneficials. A new option for managing conifer root aphid a nd balsam twig aphid has been discovered in a large-scale multi-year field experiment. Imidacloprid applied as a broadcast spray to the soil and incorporated with rainfall provides benefit for controlling these aphids and white grubs. The single applica tion of insecticide to the soil prevents the need for foliar sprays of insecticides in the subsequent year to control balsam twig aphids. Avoiding foliar sprays is anticipated to have additional benefits for conserving predators and parasites of spruce spider mites, cryptome ria scale, and elongate hemlock scale. In collaborative work for managing white pine weevil in Christmas trees, Dr. Cowles provided technical support by identi fying weevil samples submitted by extension personnel in NJ. He also chose and obt ained the materials, and provided the experimental design and protocol for testing these insecticides against white pine weevil in NJ. Annual bluegrass weevil management: Dr. Cowles is working together with extension personnel in CT, MA, NJ, RI, a nd NY to develop a research program and survey to improve annual bluegrass weevil management on golf courses. This golf course pest caused extensive in jury in CT to greens, collar areas, and fairways in 2005. Populations of weevils from an affected golf course were tested by Dr. Cowles and determined to not be susceptible to field-labeled concentrations of -cyhalothrin insecticide. This year's experiments fo cus on finding non-pyrethroid tools for managing this pest, with an emphasis on biorati onal products more compatible with the conservation of beneficial pr edatory arthropods in turf. Hemlock woolly adelgid: Two experiments in Pennsylvania state forests are fine- tuning the use of imidacloprid in soil applicatio ns to manage hemlock woolly adelgids. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 173 The greatest environmental risk may be movement in the soil of this systemic insecticide to ground water. Three avenues are availabl e to mitigate this risk: dosage reduction, reformulation of the active ingredient in a manner that will reduce the leaching potential, and improved application methods. The dos e-response experiment has demonstrated that the optimal dosage of imidacloprid is not proportional to the trunk diameter (the current label instructions). However, the l ogarithm of the dosage is proportional to the trunk diameter. Small trees could be effec tively treated at lower dosages than on the current label instructions, but trees with tr unk diameters greater than 30 inches cannot be adequately dosed in one year. Based largel y on Dr. Cowles' trials in Connecticut, soil application of imidacloprid ha s become the treatment method of choice for controlling hemlock woolly adelgid. Arborists from New Hampshire to Georgia have adopted soil- based application, including staff from the Greater Smoky Mountains National Park. Dr. Cowles developed best management practices guidelines with USDA Forest Service, university, and Bayer scientists for the soil application of im idacloprid for suppression of hemlock woolly adelgid in forests. This doc ument is in conjunction with a new Section 24c use of imidacloprid to save critical heml ock forests from destruction by adelgids in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Indoor Fungi Studies : Dr. DeWei Li conducted research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on building ma terials, and infiltration of mushroom spores outdoors into residences. Airborne fungi : Dr. Li is collecting both indoor and outdoor air samples in Avon on a weekly basis. This is a long-term study started from fall 2004 to measure the airborne fungal concentration and compositi ons (types of fungi) in Connecticut, to establish the baseline of expos ure of residents/occupants to airborne fungi in CT, and to determine seasonal and diurnal patterns of airborne fungi, and at the same time to determine the relationship of airborne indoor fungi with outdoor ones. The samples are under analysis and sampling continues. Curre ntly, thresholds of fungal exposure levels are not available in Connecticut and in the United States at pr esent due to a lack of long term research and the presence of huge of ge ographic, seasonal, and diurnal variations of airborne fungi. This study is imperative to determine the human exposure level of airborne fungi in Connecticut and the predomin ant airborne fungi in the area. Such data are useful to determine the effects of airborne fungi on public health. Fungal succession on building materials : Two batches of samples were taken and analyzed for type of fungus the extent of col onization. The data indicate that the severity of water damage had effects on the fungal co mposition on the wall units. More diverse fungal populations developed on the wall units with increasing water damage. Some studies showed that the fungal species of Penicillium and Aspergillus will be the predominant species at early stage of water damage. However, species of Penicillium and Aspergillus were not the predominant species at early stages of water damage in the present study. These results are not in agreement with current indoor air quality professionals. These data are crucial to th e IAQ industry and public health professionals for rating water damage. 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 A pilot aeromycological study in greenhouses is being conducted to determine the relationships of airborne f ungi (potential exposure levels) with foliar fungi, crops and production practice in two greenhouses in CT. Sampling is being carried out on a monthly basis starting in January, 2006. Results obtained will help the greenhouse industry to understand airborne fungal populations and compositions and their significance to occupatio nal health and crop health, for example, Trichoderma harzianum and Botrytis cinerea . Tobacco pathology : The breeding program to develop resistance to tobacco pathogens in Connecticut, including Fusarium oxysporum tobacco blue mold pathogen ( Peronospora tabacina ) is continuing for both shade and broadleaf tob acco types under the direction of Dr. James LaMondia. The development and deployment of resistant plants is the most effective, economical and environmentally safe means of managing disease. Approximately 25 lines each of shade and broadleaf tobacco were grown and evaluated under field conditions in 2005. After a tobacco free peri od to eliminate blue mold, an additional generation of 20 shade and 20 broadleaf lines was grown in the greenhouse during the winter of 2005-2006 to reduce the number of y ears required to releas e resistant lines to growers. Fusarium wilt increased in severity du ring the 1980's and early 1990's, causing up to 20% crop losses on broadleaf tobacco. The development and release of wilt-resistant broadleaf cultivars has avoided at least $5 million per year in losses due to this disease each year since 1992. Production of CAES wilt-re sistant cultivars has reduced spread of the pathogen and kept infested fields in production without soil fumigation. All advanced shade and broadleaf lines unde r development in the breeding program continue to be screened in the field for high levels of resistance to wilt. The tobacco cyst nematode decreases shade tobacco growth and leaf yield directly (losses of up to 15%) and indi rectly affects broadleaf tob acco as a component of the Fusarium wilt complex. Dr. LaMondia transferred single gene resistance to G. t. tabacum to shade and broadleaf tobaccos using both a pedigree breeding program with repeated backcrossing to Connec ticut types as well as a bulk system of modified single seed descent. Approximately 900 progeny of BC9 to BC12 or F1 hybrid crosses were evaluated for nematode resistance and/or hor ticultural characters in the field and in greenhouse tray evaluations. Leaf quality ev aluations were conducte d on advanced lines in cooperation with growers in 2004 and limite d quantities of seed were made available to growers for cooperative field evaluati on under commercial conditions. Tobacco cyst nematode shade tobacco lines are being crossed with blue mold-resistant parents to select for resistance to both pathogens. In fiel d evaluations, these re sistant lines reduced tobacco cyst nematode populations by 60 to 80%, similar to the effects of soil fumigation with a broad spectrum nematicide. The de ployment of TCN-resistant cultivars would reduce human health risks, reduce environmen tal exposure to large amounts of fumigant nematicides and be more effective than soil fumigation while eliminating costs of approximately $500 per acre. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 175 Single dominant gene resistance to tobacco mosaic virus is present in many of these lines. Evaluation and selection for TM V resistance is conducted on all field-grown progeny. In 2002 to 2005, TMV infection resulted in significant commercial losses ($3 million to $5 million) due to green spot symptom development on susceptible shade and broadleaf tobacco leaves. Our research demons trated the association of green spot with TMV infection, and determined that plant resi stance was the single most important factor for reducing green spot disease. Grower lines were evaluated for resistance to TMV and large amounts of seed of homozygous TM V-resistant shade and broadleaf tobacco produced at the Valley Lab were distributed to growers to reduce losses from virus infection. This seed will avoid large economic losses due to TMV. Blue mold, caused by Peronospora tabacina, has been a recurring problem on tobacco in the Connecticut River Valley from 1997 through 2004, causing losses up to the tens of millions of dollars annually. The development and use of better spray technology, timing of applications , and grower education has greatly reduced blue mold severity in recent years. Tob acco lines with resistance to bl ue mold were collected from different sources and evaluated for blue mold resistance under field conditions in Windsor. Two shade tobacco lines developed by the USDA in the 1960's, line numbers 509 and 292-393, were promising sources of adap ted resistance and have been used as parents in crosses to Connecticut shade tob acco types. A Cuban dark tobacco accession, H2000, was found to be virtually immune to blue mold infection and is also being used as a resistant parent in crosse s to Connecticut broadleaf t obacco. Blue mold resistance breeding in shade and broadleaf is being at tempted through the selection of resistant inbred lines and the development of male -sterile Connecticut types to allow the production of F1 hybrids between resistant a nd susceptible shade t obacco and resistant and susceptible broadleaf tob acco. Male sterile lines ar e being developed to allow production of F1 hybrid blue mold resistant seed. Blue mold incidence was compared between susceptible commercial varieties and resistant lines. Over 5 pickings in 2004, susceptible 8212 tobacco had a total of 360 bl ue mold lesions per plant while several promising advanced breeding lines had 0 to 11 lesions per plant. Six advanced F1 male-sterile hybrid broa dleaf lines and five advanced F1 male- sterile hybrid shade tobacco lin es were distributed to grow ers for commercial evaluation during the 2006 season. If lines appear to have potential for commercial production, seed will be increased and tested again on a larger scale in 2007. The use of plant resistance would have a large impact on disease manage ment, the environment, and human health. Fungicide applications were evaluated fo r efficacy of blue mold control in shade tobacco in Windsor, CT. Acrobat MZ, Actigar d, and Quadris fungicides were applied at 14-day intervals to shade and broadleaf tobacco plants in small plots. Actigard resulted in fewer blue mold lesions per leaf than Ac robat MZ (1.0 to 2.5 lb./ acre) or Quadris (0.24 or 0.48 pt/acre) and was active at rates as low as 0.03 oz/a cre Actigard when applied in combination with Acrobat MZ or Quadris. All fungicide appli cations resulted in significantly less disease than untreated controls. Actigard, a systemic acquired resistance elicitor, appears to act synergistic ally with fungicides to increase fungicide efficacy at very low rates. This synergy may greatly increase fungicide efficacy while reducing the amount of to tal fungicide The tobacco cyst apper tobacco. Broadleaf is a stalk-cut tobacco type 176 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 typically harvested 55 to 65 days after transplanting. Growers commonly stagger planting over a period of several weeks and harv est over a similar, staggered time frame. A common practice has been to leave cut stalks in the field until an entire field or farm is harvested. The fields are then tilled and planted to a wint er cover crop. We performed experiments over several years to determine cyst nematode populations after immediate tillage to break up roots compared to leaving cu t stalks and roots in the field from 2 to 6 wks after harvest before tillage and planti ng to a cover crop. Pl ots tilled immediately after harvest had consistently lower final TCN populations ( P < 0.02 to 0.0003) and Pf/Pi ratios when compared to plots with delayed tillage 2 to 6 wk after harvest. Final TCN densities in soil after imme diate tillage ranged from 64% to 18.5% of densities tillage 2 wk or 6 wk after ha rvest, respectively. A factoria l experiment with Nemacur or no Nemacur and early (immediately after ha rvest) or late til lage (5 wk later) demonstrated that both nematicide and tillage timing affected TCN final populations in soil. There were no significant interactions. When tillage of stalks and roots is delayed until harvest is complete on an entire field or farm, it allows late first generation or early second generation females to develop. Timely destruction of roots slows the increase of G. t. tabacum to damaging levels in soil (Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0.65 to 2.21 after immediate tillage compared to 1.0 to 6.78 fo r later tillage) and reduces the need for chemical management to avoid yield loss. This may save growers the expense of soil fumigation and protect the environment by re ducing the application of broad-spectrum fumigants to soils. Tobacco mosaic virus is a common and important pathogen of cigar wrapper tobacco. The disease has recently been su ccessfully managed by the incorporation of genetic resistance derived from Nicotiana glutinosa into the most widely grown shade and broadleaf tobacco cultivars. This resist ance is conferred by a single dominant gene (N locus) that results in a hypersensitive local lesion reaction. However, recent genetic drift and selection for size has resulted in th e loss of TMV resist ance in most grower selections. Recent TMV epidemics in flue-cured and other tobacco types have resulted in increased incidence of inoculum present in many tobacco products. The combination of widespread TMV inoculum and an inadvertent loss of TMV-resistance in two of the most widely-grown wrapper-tobacco cultivars in the Connecticut River Valley resulted in severe losses due to TMV symptoms on tob acco in the field and green spot on cured leaves in 2004 and 2005. TMV resistance is temperature dependent and has been reported to fail at temperatures above 28C . The effects of TMV infection on TMV infection of resistant plants under hot summer weather conditi ons (at temperatures greater than 28C) in shade tents had not been de termined. We conducted experiments to determine i) whether TMV was associated with green spot on cured leaves of non- symptomatic wrapper tobacco, ii) the effects of plant resistance on green spot incidence and severity, and iii) the e ffects of temperature and inoc ulation on the development of TMV on resistant or susceptible tobacco plants in the field and green spot on cured leaves. Fresh tobacco leaf tissue was test ed for TMV using a commercially available double antibody sandwich enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (DAS alkaline phosphatase ELISA) kit for the common strain of TMV. The proportion of TMV-inoculated near-i sogenic tobacco lines resistant or susceptible to TMV with green spot symptoms (1 or more green spots per leaf) on cured leaves was greater for TMV-susceptible plan ts than for TMV-resistant plants. The The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 177 differences between TMV-susceptible and resi stant plants were even greater when the proportion of cured leaves with severe green spot (>25 spots per leaf) were compared. Susceptible plants had nearly 10 times the l eaves with severe symptoms. When tissue was tested for virus titer, resistant plants were not found to contai n the virus except for the parts of the leaves which were inoculat ed. In contrast, TMV spread quickly through susceptible plants. In experiments where plants were held at consta nt temperatures above 82 F, resistance was no longer expressed in resistant plants. However, in field experiments under hot daytime conditions but cooler night temperatures, resistance continued to be expressed and virus particles did not spread throughout the plant. Plant resistance remains the single most importa nt means of managing TMV in commercial wrapper tobacco crops. Weed research: Dr. Todd Mervosh conducts research on weed management in a variety of crop systems and at non-agricultural sites. In the past year, his projects included weed control experiments in ornament al plants grown in containers, Christmas trees, and pumpkins. These experiments were conducted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor and/or in growers' fields or nurseries. Dr. John Ahrens is a research partner in some experiments involving ornamental s and Christmas trees. In addition, Dr. Mervosh is conducting experime nts to find effective and environmentally sound methods to control the following invasive plants: common reed ( Phragmites ) in a coastal ecosystem, and shrub honeysuckle (Lonicera sp.) in a shoreline community. Krystl e Olszewski and Dorothy Reiss assisted with projects during th e summers of 2005 and 2006. Nursery ornamental weed control: Liverworts ( Marchantia sp.) are troublesome weeds in container-grown nursery stock, especially in propagation houses and greenhouses. They form dense mats on potting media surfaces and are very difficult to remove. Liverworts are bryophyt es and unaffected by most herbicides used to prevent weed seedling emergence in containers. The federal IR-4 Ornamental Crops program has placed a high priority on evaluating plant tolerances to quinoclamine, a compound known to provide control of liverworts, mosses a nd algae. Quinoclamine (Mogeton WP) has been used for many years in some European countries and Japan, but is still under evaluation by the U.S. EPA. In addition to Mogeton sprays, we also evaluated a granular product (TerraCyte) containing sodium carbona te peroxyhydrate as active ingredient. TerraCyte is already registered for use as an algaecide/fungici de that also has activity on liverworts and mosses. The experiment wa s conducted in the spring and summer of 2005 in a propagation house at a large Connect icut nursery. TerraCyte and Mogeton treatments were effective in controlling liverw ort. TerraCyte injured the foliage of some plants, whereas Mogeton caused no visible injury at the prop osed application dosage, and in most cases, no injury at four times the normal dosage. If approved by EPA, Mogeton demonstrates excellent potential as a liverwo rt control agent for nur series and greenhouse growers. At the IR-4 Ornamental Horticulture Workshop in 2003, high priority was placed on obtaining data needed to expand labels for pr eemergence herbicides to include additional 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 herbaceous perennials. We conducted experi ments in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate several ornamental perennials for their tolerances to herbicides not currently registered for use on these plants. The following herbicides were included: s-metolachlor sprays 2.5TG). Herbicide treatmen ts were applied over the top of plants at up to four times the labeled dosage, and all tr eatments were applied again 8 weeks later. In this way, plant tolerances are tested under a worst-case scenario. Some plants were highly tolerant of one or more of the herbicides evaluated. The IR-4 program will submit this information to the EPA and to the manu facturers of these herbicides, who will then consider changes to the herbicide labels. The eventual result is that nurseries will have additional weed control options for the wide variety of plants they grow. The granular herbicide BroadStar 0.25G was registered for use in 2003. It is being used by several nurseries in CT to prevent gr assy and broadleaf weeds in containers and field plantings. BroadStar cont rols weeds at much lower dosages than other herbicides used by nurseries, but it has a more limited label in terms of the list of tolerant ornamental species. Only spec ified woody plants are tolerant of BroadStar. In most cases, nurseries apply preemergence herbicides as soon as possible afte r plants are potted, prior to emergence of any w eed seedlings. Plants tend to be more susceptible to herbicide injury right after they are transplant ed. The objective of this experiment was to determine if delayed application of BroadS tar (by 1 or 2 weeks after planting) would reduce the injury to plants sensitive to this herbicide and also efficacy against weeds. Dwarf burning bush ( Euonymus alatus 'Compactus') was tolera nt of timings. However, spirea ( Spiraea x bumalda 'Goldflame') was injured by BroadStar when applied right af ter transplanting, but the injury was much less severe when the application was delayed by 1 or 2 weeks. Weed control was not significantly affected by trea tment application timing. Weed Management in Pumpkins: Herbicide options for pum pkins were evaluated in 2005 in experiments conducted at the CAES Valley Laboratory in Windsor. Pumpkin seeds were planted by hand on June 30 in fres hly tilled sandy loam soil containing about 2% organic matter. The experiment incl uded two pumpkin varieties ('Howden' and 'Spooktacular') that were planted in alternati ng plots. Treatments included an untreated check and a hand-weeded check. The follo wing preemergence (PRE) 0.375 lb/A oz/A ai). Halosulfuron was also applied as postemerge nce (POST) treatments. In these plots, ethalfluralin (1.125 lb/A ai) ha d been applied preemergence to prevent annual grasses. Postemergence halosulfuron treatments (0.25 and 0.5 oz/A POST\" timings. Also applied on July 16 was a treatment containing the herbicid es halosulfuron (0.5 oz/A ai) + sethoxydim [Poast] (0.19 lb/A ai) to control emerged weeds in plots that did not receive any preemergence treatment. The primary weeds in the field yellow The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 179 nutsedge ( Cyperus esculentus ). The best overall weed control was provided by Strategy at the highest dosage and the Curbit + Sa ndea PRE treatments. Yellow nutsedge was only controlled in plots in which Sandea was applied. Sandea was effective on yellow nutsedge at all application timings and doses. Halosulfuron was the only herbicide to cause significant injury to pumpkins. Slight stunting and chlorosis occurred when halosulfur on was applied PRE, more injury resulted from early POST treatments, and the most severe injury occurred on pumpkins sprayed with late POST halosulfuron treatments. In jury was directly related to halosulfuron application rate, but was most dependent on application timing. Mo st injured plants recovered well, except for the pumpkins receivi ng the late POST halosulfuron treatments. As expected, the lowest pum pkin yield was harvested from the untreated (weedy) check plots. The highest pumpkin yields were obtai ned from plots treated with Strategy at the medium and high dosage. Invasive Plant Management: Phragmites (common reed; Phragmites australis ) is a very tall member of the grass family (Gramineae). It is a perennial that spreads aggressively via rhizomes to form large monotypic colonies, primarily in wet soils. Phragmites is a widespread problem in wetlands and marshes because it is highly invasive and displaces many native plants in these habitats. Very few plants can compet e with a dense stand of phragmites that can reach heights of 14 feet. Phragmites is very difficult to control. Mowing or cutting a stand of phragmites provides only temporary su ppression of this inva sive plant. Three herbicides that are approved by EPA for weed control in wetlands a nd aquatic sites have demonstrated potential for control of phragmites. Dr. Mervosh, in cooperation with Davi d Roach of All Habitat Services LLC (Madison, CT), is conducting phragmites contro l research at two sites in CT: Laurel Marsh in Manchester (a fres hwater marsh) and Ayer's Point Marsh in Old Saybrook (a brackish marsh - primarily freshwater with some salt water influx with the tides). Dr. Mervosh began this study in 2004. Herb icide treatments consisted of various dosages and combinations of Rodeo (glyphosat e) and/or Habitat (imazapyr), and were applied in June, August and October. Pl ots were evaluated th roughout 2004, and final ratings of phragmites vigor, stem density a nd height were taken in the summer of 2005. In general, the August 2004 application timing was the most effective in that all the treatments reduced phragmites by more th an 90% at 1 year after treatment. Treatments applied in June suppressed phrag mites growth for the remainder of 2004, but significant re-growth occurred in most plots in 2005. June treatments that contained Habitat at dosages of at least 1 qt/acre we re most effective at reducing phragmites in 2005. Because a significant frost had occurred in early October, the October treatments were applied later than the optimal fall timi ng for phragmites. Thus, these treatments were not as effective as expected. Dr. Mervosh is working in cooperation with David Gumbart of The Nature Conservancy on a project partially funde d by the Long Island Sound License Plate Program, administered by the Connecticut Department of Envi ronmental Protection, Office of Long Island Sound Programs. The pr oject began in 2003. The primary focus is to conduct research on control of the non-nati ve invasive plants Oriental bittersweet 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 at Bluff Point State Park and Coastal Reserve in Groton, CT, a nd to remediate specific areas impacted by these invasives. These plants threaten the health of ecosystems at this coastal location and in many other areas thr oughout North America. By obtai ning data on the efficacy of various treatments, the scientists hope to improve conditions for native vegetation at Bluff Point and provide information for other projects intended to manage these invasive plants. Oriental bittersweet is a woody vine that wraps around and climbs trees and grows over other vegetation. Bi ttersweet vines are widespread in parts of the forested section at Bluff Point and are adversely affec ting trees and shrubs. Pale swallowwort is an herbaceous perennial in the milkweed family. Swallowwort, a relatively recent invader at Bluff Point, is outcompeting rare native along the shoreline, particularly the cobble beach habitat just above the high tide line. Research was conducted over a 3- year period. Experimental treatments we re applied in 2003 and 2004, and data were collected through 2005. For Oriental bittersweet, vi nes were tagged in two size cl asses: diameters of 15 to 25 mm (\"small\") and diameters of 26 to 40 mm (\"large\"). Vines were measured and treatments were applied to vines between 15 and 30 cm above ground. Each treatment was applied randomly to ten vines (five small and five large) at each of three timings (May, August, November) in 2003, and similarly to a different set of vines at the same timings in 2004. Herbicides we re applied undiluted with a pa int brush. Basal-bark (BB) treatments consisted of 1.5 ml of herbicide applied uniformly to the lower bark of uncut vines. Cut-stump (CS) treatments consisted of 0.75 ml of herbicide applied to the stump surface of freshly cut vines. Eight treatments were applied: BB untreated CS ai), CS glyphosate (25% ai). Vines were evaluated in the summer of the following growing season. CS herbicide treatments were gene rally more effective than BB treatments, especially when applied in November 2004. A ll CS treatments with either triclopyr or glyphosate were effective in reducing vine surv ival (77 to 93% mortality) and number of sprouts from stumps or roots (91 to 99% reduction). For pale swallowwort, 1.83 x 3.05 m plots were established in areas of high infestation along the cobble beach. Treat ments (RCB design with three replicates) applied to plots in July 2003 and again in August 2004 in cluded hand pulling, cutting, application of glyphosate (20.5% ai) or triclopyr amine (22.2% ai) to cut glyphosate (0.82% ai) or triclopyr amine (0.89% ai). Plots were evaluated for percent area covered by swallowwort, swa llowwort vigor, and presence of other vegetation. By July 2005, glyphosate foliar sprays and cut-stem treatments with glyphosate or triclopyr caused the greatest re duction in the amount of swallowwort, and the glyphosate spray treatment was most e ffective in reducing swallowwort vigor. Triclopyr foliar sprays caused temporary injury but swallowwort recovered, and long- term control was no better than that provi ded by hand pulling or cutting once per year. There are a number of non-na tive, invasive honeysuckle ( Lonicera ) species in Connecticut. Honeysuckle shrubs have spread widely in a parcel of wooded land owned The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 181 by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) near Black Point Beach in East Lyme. This project was conducted by Dr. Mervosh in coopera tion with David Gumbart of TNC. Honeysuckle shrubs were tagged and then cut and/or stump-treated with various herbicides on August 17, 2005. For each shrub, a saw was used to cut off each stem 6 to 12 inches above ground level. Herbicide treatmen ts (diluted in water) were applied to cut surfaces with a paint brush within a few mi nutes after cutting. Treatments included Roundup Pro solution, (tri clopyr ester) 10% or 50% solution. On May 18, 2006, the honeysuckle shrubs were evaluated for new growth. Shrubs that had not been cut at all averaged 7 ft tall and 8 ft wide. Stumps that had been cut the previous August, wit hout herbicide treatment, produced 25 to 80 new sprouts that were an average of 16 inches long. No spr outs were found on any of the stumps treated with Roundup Pro; these stumps appeared to be dead. Stumps treated with a 10% solution of Garlon 3A or Garlon 4 had at leas t 2 new sprouts per stump, but these sprouts were generally stunted and exhibited triclopyr injury symptoms. Most stumps treated with a 50% solution of Garlon 3A or Garlon 4 had no new sprouts, but there were a few that did have some stunted and distorted spr outs. Garlon 3A treatments were somewhat more effective than Garlon 4 treatments in preventing new sprout formation. But glyphosate (Roundup Pro) treatments were co mpletely effective in preventing new growth the following spring. Christmas Trees . In 2000, Mr. Rathier began a l ong-term experiment to determine how much nutrition Christmas trees get from the soil they are planted in compared to how much they get from applied fertilizer s. Several plantations in Connecticut successfully grow trees with no annual applic ations of fertilizer though it may take them longer to grow. Forestry research suggests th at uptake of fertilizer applied nutrients is slight compared to what trees get from native so il. But the slight extra nutrition that trees obtain from fertilizer nutrients may be enough to maintain quality color and reach salable size a year or more sooner. Therefore, plots have been esta blished at the Valley Laboratory for a ten-year experiment. Unif ormly high quality, 4-year-old Fraser fir transplants were planted at ten foot spaci ng, which will allow for annual root pruning between plots to limit root growth into ad jacent plots. One treatment will receive no fertilizer for ten years. Others will receive the following annual treatments that began in 2002: phosphorus and potassium only; ni trogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) applied in the spring; NPK app lied in the fall; and NPK applied in the spring along with a second application of N only in the fall. Ev ery 2 years, 4 trees from each treatment will be cut, chopped and analyzed for nutrients . During the summer of 2003, visual color differences were observed between trees rece iving N (darker green) and those that have not received N (lighter green). The first set of trees to be harvested for analyzes were cut in December 2003 and the second set in Decem ber 2005. Fresh and dr y weight data did not differ between treatments. Additional ha rvests are planned every 2 years until the trees reach maturity. Results of this experiment could impact the industry by helping growers realize the fertility values of thei r soils, possible avoiding over fertilization. 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 In 2000, Mr. Rathier established a Christma s tree transplant su rvival experiment at the Valley Laboratory. With droughty spri ngs and/or summers o ccurring in three out of the last five years many Christmas tr ee growers have experienced substantial transplant losses that may be reflected in a shortage of mature tr ees in seven or eight years. Since most tree plantations cannot be easily irrigated, bare root transplants are greatly susceptible to drought problems and grow ers are looking for strategies or products that may assist in survival . Products such as biostimulants, mycorrhizal fungi and planting gels are currently being used to impr ove transplant survival in the landscape and arborist industries. The volume of roots may also play a role in survival, so the Fraser fir transplants in this experiment were graded into 2 categories - good and poor. Each root grade group was planted with one of the fo llowing transplant survival products: biostimulant; mycorrhizal fungi; planting gel; a combination of all three products; and no treatment. In July 2002, one tree was removed from each plot and evaluated for root quantity and quality. The only effect noticed wa s that the trees with greater root volumes at planting were the most vigor ous and continued to have the greatest root volumes. No effects were observed due to any of the suppl emental treatments. Similar results were observed with the second harvest in 2003. The 2004 harvest revealed similar results. Two trees will remain in each plot to grow to salable size. Enough room was left in this experiment to make a second planting in spring, 2002 in cooperation with Dr. Cowles. Instead of grading by root volumes, however, the trees were graded based on whether or not they had their root systems injured by white grub feeding. The same evaluation criteria will apply to these trees. The Impact of transplant survival expe riments should be to help growers optimize survival and avoid costly replanti ng and losing time in production areas. Tobacco. One shade tobacco grower in th e valley is growing the crop under plasticulture (e.g. plastic film mulch for weed control and leaching management and drip irrigation for water and nutrient manageme nt). This method is appropriate for Connecticut tobacco but is complicated by the fa ct that the quality of our crops is linked to the traditional use of natura l sources of nitrogen such as cottonseed meal or castor pomace. Conventional culture allows for the ap plication of these meal types of fertilizers prior to planting and in side-dressings throughout the first 30 days afte r transplant in the field. Formation of raised be ds and installation of the drip irrigation and plastic mulch limit the use of meals to the preplant period on ly. Determining how much meal to add in advance and its rate of mineralization under the plastic is a sign ificant challenge. Additionally, amounts and timing of supplemen tal nitrogen applie d through the drip irrigation needs to be determined. Since 1997, Mr. Rathier has been conducti ng studies at shade tobacco farms in Suffield and West Suffield, CT. The findings thus far are 1. The plastic mulch speeds up the N mineralization rate by 2-3 weeks, de pending on the weather. In years with unusually high rainfall amounts and cool soil conditions, the plastic mulch actually slows down N mineralization. 2. The timing of suppl ement N applications should mirror the N needs of the plants but be advanced by a bout 2 weeks; 3. Applying twice as much meal fertilizer than normal does not improve N av ailability or yield or leaf quality. 4. Applying no meal fertilizer in advance reduc es N availability, yield and leaf quality; 5. Eliminating supplement soluble N addition re duces yield and leaf quality but not N The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 183 availability. 6. No difference was observ ed among different N treatments when soil texture was variable. 7. The actual amounts of supplement soluble N needed at any one time are far less under plastic. This study will continue for a few more years to work out all the possible variations of preplant and s upplemental nitrogen and their affects on yield and quality. The major impact of this experi ment will be to help growers reduce losses of nitrate nitrogen and other solutes to ground wa ter, reduce fertilizer costs and improve the ability to grow a uniform crop. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information: A total of 8,517 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year . The majority of these que ries (62%) were answered by Mr. Thomas Rathier (5,296), assisted by Mr. John Winiarski (853) and Ms. Rose Hiskes (388) in the inquiry office , and by (10%), Cowles (5%), and About 60% of requests for info rmation were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pe st control operators. Inquiries by subject category were as follows: arthropod pests (21%); plant diseases (10%); general horticultural information (26%); soil fertil ity and water issues (26%); pesticide use (10%); weed control (4%); mammals, bi rds and reptiles (2%); and others (1%). Continuing concern among tobacco growers over the blue mold epidemic in the Connecticut River Valley spawned a large num ber of inquiries to Dr. James LaMondia and Thomas Rathier. Dr. LaMondia initia ted and maintained the Connecticut River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progress of the disease in North America, and the potentia l exposure and management options in the Valley. He also obtained Section 18 registra tions for Quadris and Acrobat MZ fungicides for control of blue mold in shade tobacco. Inquiry office perspective: Commercial agriculture: Mr. Rathier made 52 field visits to co mmercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests a nd private landscapes to diagnose complex problems firsthand. Some problems were so lved during the visits but many required taking plant and soil samples for laboratory analyses and subsequent reports to the growers. Most of the inquiries from commerc ial agriculture came during grower visits to the diagnostic lab or during phone calls. Many diagnoses were centered on plant responses to weathe r conditions. The 2005 growing season was a year of oddities and extremes. There were nearly 30 days during the summer during which the temperatures exceeded 90F and nearly 20 inches of rain fell during 10 days in October. The hot summer was accompanied by significant drought conditions that further stressed cr ops. Annual crop yields were reduced and woody crops were similarly threatened. Ma ny large trees in parks, golf courses and commercial landscapes required substantial pr uning or even removal in 2006 due to the drought. Many weakened trees have succumbed to vascular wilts such as Verticillium and Dutch elm disease and various borers. 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Newly planted and mature Christmas trees were significantly stressed during the droughty 2005 growing season. Fall 2005 saw some recovery and the 2006 spring planting season was generally favorable alt hough excessive rainfalls in each season may have adverse affects where soil conditions don't favor good drainage . White pine weevil, Pales weevil, spruce spider mites and elongate hemlock scale were the insect pests most often reported. Needle diseases (Rhabdoclin e and Rhizosphaera n eedlecasts and spruce needle rust were the most reported problems. Comparatively little winter injury was observed on overwintering woody plants in production settings although some desiccation injuries occurred on broadleaf evergreens and conifers. Growers of woody and herbaceous plants in containers outdoors were faced with irrigation water shortage s that limited leaching capabilities resulting in elevated soluble salt levels in potting media. Most plants over wint ering in white plastic covered hoophouses or other structures made it through th e winter with very few injuries. Freeze and frost injuries and subseque nt bacterial or fungal blights and leaf spots resulted in significant losses, especially in lilacs and rhododendrons . Continued cool and wet conditions in Spring 2006 hampered nutrient release from slow release fertilizers resulting in some off color new growth. Greenhouse growers experienced a bright though difficult to heat late winter season but cool, dark conditions during the spri ng resulted in root diseases such as Pythium and foliar diseases, especially Botry tis blight. The marketing season for bedding plants was marred by several rainy, co ld weekends which limited sales. Golf courses and turf farms saw dr ought related problem s during Summer 2005 and foliar and root diseases th roughout the cool, moist fall. Forage crops grew slowly during the drought and most growers were ha mpered by rains with the hay harvest on time in June 2006. Silage crop harvests were reduced in 2005 as wet conditions made storage of harvests difficult. Spring plan ting in 2006 was hampered by continuous rains. Small fruit harvests were below aver age during the 2005 seas on, with droughty conditions causing significant yield reduction. Spring 2006 saw very little frost damage to strawberries but difficult conditions for harvesting and yields were average. Vegetable growers near continuous irri gation and had only m odest harvests in 2005. Bacterial spot and wilt diseases continued to plague peppers and tomatoes. Growers using plasticulture or row covers saw fewer problems despite a colder than normal start. The planting season in 2006 was plagued by prolonged by cold, wet soil conditions. Many growers had to replant fields. Tobacco acreages did well in 2005 thanks to prolonged warmth and dry conditions. Blue mold appeared very late in the season with nearly no affect on yields thanks to greater attention to fungicide sp ray coverage and the widespread use of the fungicide Acrobat. Most broadleaf tobacco growers experienced significant curing losses as wet conditions in late summe r kept harvested tobacco from drying properly in sheds. Ordinary insect problems, such as budworms and aphids we re present in many fields. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 185 The transplant production season in spring 2006, as was the case in the three previous seasons, was hampered by significant periods of cool, dark conditions, which limited rapid growth in the greenhouse. Also present in spring 2005 was black root rot (Thielaviopsis basicola ) and root rots caused by Pythium and Rhioctonia resulting substantial losses of transplants. Presently, no fungicide is register ed for management of this disease but growers can successfully use cultural met hods to manage the disease. Commercial and Home Landscapes As with commercial agriculture, weathe r conditions througho ut the bulk of 2005 were hot and droughty and nearly all landscape plants were se verely stressed. Conditions in Spring 2006 were somewhat favorable but de siccation problems, especially to conifers like arborvitae were numerous and like to persist. Plants installed in landscapes in Spring 2006 have seen reduced stress so far. Vascular wilts, most commonly caused by Verticillium were diagnosed in many different woody plants but most commonly in maples. More than likely the infections were made worse by the droughty conditions of previous seasons. Despite the moist conditions, many trees will continue to fail well into 2005. Home landscapers reported significant difficu lties transplanted trees and shrubs, due mostly to the lack of rainfall throughout th e 2005 growing season. Transplant shock or failure remains the single most important cause of losses in landscapes. In some cases, field dug shrubs and trees did not have enough roots to support the transplant and soil conditions did not allow timely growth of new roots. Container grown plants may have had too many roots that didn' t allow the plant to grow ne w roots until too late. The highly porous conditions of container growing media create conditions were root growth dominates the space within the container and the plants do well while under daily irrigation. But once that root ball is placed in a typical landscape soil, its needs are no longer met. The plant lives on the carbohydrate reserves in the roots and stems and often do not grow new roots. Landscapers and homeo wners need to take better care to prevent or limit this condition. Home landscapers with frequent irriga tion habits reported many cases of slime molds growing on mulches, especially wood ch ips or locally produced bark mulch that contained large amounts of wood. The presen ce of wood in the mulch allows the mold fungi to grow more rapidly and the moist cond itions of regular irriga tion created the ideal environment for growth. Artillery fungus that \"shoots\" spore cases towards light colors such as structures and vehicles, also grow well in these conditions and was widely reported. Also a result of previous dark, mois t growing seasons, algae and lichens were reported on a variety of surfaces including trees, paved areas, bare soil, roofs and siding. Frost and freeze related problems were observed on an assortment of plants in June 2005. 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 Hemlock woolly adelgid has begun to rebound somewhat after three difficult winters in a row. Cool moist conditions in the 2004 growing season and a moderate winter of 2004-2005 allowed many hemlocks to recover and grow more vigorously. Also plaguing hemlocks and other conifers were elongate hemlock scale and spruce spider mites. Gypsy moths were quite prevalent in severa l areas around the state, the result of dry conditions in June 2005. Sprays were typically not needed but homeowners and landscapers are being cautioned to scout for egg masses in the coming winter and to be prepared to spray next year. Spring 2006 conditions favored the return of natural controls. Also observed in Spring 20 06 were forest tent caterpillars. Other arthropods of note during the th roughout 2003 were white pine weevil and Pales weevil. Hard pines were once again infested with European sawflies, tip moths and pine shoot moths. Leafhoppers, lace bugs, arbo rvitae leaf miners were more plentiful and significant defoliation by assorted caterpi llars and sawflies was observed on deciduous and evergreen plants. Also noticed were azalea bark scale, cottony camellia scale, assorted lecanium scales and white prunicola scale. Hibiscus sa wfly and lily leaf beetle, both newcomers to Connecticut continued to esta blish populations in Connec ticut. Viburnum aphids and assorted eriophyid mites were more numerous in spring 2006. Diseases were more plentiful in 2005-2006, especially foliar disorders such as leaf spots, blights and anthracnose. Anthracnos es have been widespread and especially problematic to sycamores, oaks, maples a nd birches. Cedar apple rust and other gymnosporangium rusts were quite co mmon on many crabapples, hawthorn and shadbush. Stress related cankers were repor ted on many trees, especially ornamental cherries, maples and beeches. Powdery mildew was a problem on many di fferent broadleaf trees and shrubs as well as herbaceous plants. Conifers were pl agued by needlecasts, n eedle rusts, and tip blights. Home lawns experienced drought co nditions throughout summer 2005 that resulted in substantial losses. Disease pressure was much higher on high maintenance lawns, especially summer patch, dollar spot, leaf spots, Pythium and red thread. Large numbers of scarab beetles adults were re ported in spring 2006, so caution may be appropriate for the coming season. White grub injury was very obvious because conditions were stressful. Chinch bugs were a problem also. Bluegrass billbug outbreaks have been observed on a few occasions and only on sodded areas. Ground ivy, violets, corn speedwell and yello w nutsedge were the most important weeds in lawns. Poor crabgrass management was a common observation in 2005 due mostly to home landscapers applying pre-em ergent controls too early in the season followed by heavy rains and cool conditions. Crabgrass germinated late in most lawns The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 187 and management compounds were below the seed by then. Moss colonization of poor turf areas received plenty of attent ion from homeowners, as well. Management strategies offered for al l pests include cultu ral and sanitary approaches as the primary effort with low impa ct pesticides as a second effort, and lastly, stronger pesticides when other approaches do not succeed. Wildlife and Structural Pests Animal problems were numerous th roughout the year with most inquiries concerning squirrels, chipmunks, moles, voles, rabbits, woodchucks, skunks and snakes. Insects that bother humans were of concern to many homeowners.. Mosquito problems were more intense in spring 2006 due to excessive rainfall. Many ticks were submitted for identification. All black legged ticks were forwarded to the lab in New Haven for spirochete analysis. Wasps, esp ecially German yellow jackets and solitary ground bees were bothersome to many. Nu merous populations of ground bees were reported in Spring 2005. Among arthropods found inside structures, carpenter ants, termites, black and varied carpet beetles, ground beetle s, grass carrier wasps, cigarette beetles, larder beetles, acorn weevils, foreign grain beetle, confused flour beetles and spiders received the most attention. Also noted were multicolored Asia n lady beetles, squash bugs, western conifer seed bugs, boxelder bugs, clover asso rted food infesting Indian meal moths and centipedes and millipedes. On a somewhat disturbing note, Bed bugs were submitted in greater numbers in the past year. Where management strategies for ind oor and other structural pests were necessary, most homeowners chos e baiting and/or sanitation ra ther than pesticide use. Field visits by scientific staff : Valley Laboratory scien tists visited 468 commercial fields, greenhouses, golf courses, Christmas tr ee farms, residential properties, parks and forests during the past year to conduct rese arch and diagnose the more complex problems firsthand. The majority of these visits we re made by Timothy Abbey (178) who visited production nurseries, Christmas tree growers, a nd golf courses. Dr. Carole Cheah visited 139 forest sites, Thomas Rathier made 50 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes, Dr. Richard Cowles made 20 field visits to evaluate soil- inhabiting insect pests and mites in nurseries and strawberry fields, Dr. James LaMondia visited 24 farms, Dr. DeWei Li made 13 visits to investigate molds, and Drs. Todd Mervosh and John Ahrens made 27 and 17 visits, respectively, to inves tigate weed control problems. Most problems were solved during these visits, but many required taki ng plant and soil samples for laboratory analysis with subsequent reports to growers by letter or phone call. Special diagnostic tests: Valley Laboratory scientists conducted 1014 special diagnostic tests at the request of citizens during the past ye ar. Of these, 526 were in- depth investigations of unusual pest problem s by Thomas Rathier and Rose Hiskes, 241 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2005-2006 involved identification and enumeration of pl ant parasitic nematode s in soil samples by Dr. James LaMondia, 40 were evaluations of mites and soil-inhabiting insects by Dr. Richard Cowles, 52 were tobacco seed germin ation trials and 84 were soil texture or organic matter determinations conducted by Mr. John Winiarski, 52 were made by Tim Abbey from nursery visits, and 8 were identi fications and control evaluations of weeds by Drs. Todd Mervosh and John Ahrens. Soil testing: A total of 4,499 soil tests were expertly performed by Mr. John Winiarski during the past year. About 64% were performed for commercial growers, 31% for homeowners, 1.5% for municipalities, and the remainder for Station research. Of the 2,862 commercial samples submitted, 50% were for landscapers; 24% for tobacco growers; 8% for nursery growers; vegetable golf course for fruit growers; 1.5% for Christmas tree growers; 1% for greenhouse growers, and the remainder for others. Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room : Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regu larly for their meetings. During the past year, 38 different groups used the room on 123 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Farmland Trust, Connect icut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Chapter of the National Organic Farmers Asso ciation, Farm Wine C ouncil, the CT Wine Association, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Connecticut Farm Fresh, Connecticut Greenhouse Grower's Association, Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association, and Connecticut Inva sive Plants Workgroup. Jane Morrison, Thomas Rathier and John Winiarski schedul ed the appointments and Richard Horvath arranged the furniture for scheduled meetings and ensured that the room was available after hours.
