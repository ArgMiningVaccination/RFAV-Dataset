I knew not everyone would have the opportunity of experiencing the healing powers of herbs and their essences this way. In 1994 I created some extractions with our native herbs and trees; I went to my grandfather and he took me into ceremony. Afterwards my grandfather smelled the preparations and he said, \"Aah, you captured the angels, make a big bucket!\" I understood this as a \"yes\" you have permission to share this knowledge and these remedies. I incorporate pure essential oils as a way to accommodate the lay person or professional who is not an herb gatherer to successfully use and create aromatherapy products into their lives. In Native Aromatherapy, besides going over the more clinical and chemical side of aromatherapy, we learn about our plant relatives' nature and its medicine. Communion (communication) is taught by directly interacting with the plant through the creation of remedies. WHO IS NATIVE AROMATHERAPY FOR? Anyone with the desire to learn how to create non-polluting, non-poisoning, life giving natural products for their medicines, body care, and home cleaning products. We are tired of corporate chemicals in our water, in our air in our soil, in our breast milk, and in our children. We still remember another way in balance Cynthia King Owner and creator of \"Native Forest Remedies\" and THE HERB SHED THE HERB SHED presents NATIVE AROMATHERAPY Come and learn the basic foundation of how aromatherapy works - why essential oils are effective, pure and safe to incorporate into your daily lifestyle and /or business. Professionals earn 16 Continuing Educational Units (CEU's) and lay persons a wealth of knowledge with practical applications for health and help for body, mind and home. Aromatherapy is as old as any ancient culture, this knowledge is part of our human legacy. My grandfather taught me that when I wished to know more about something, I should make offerings and pray for the \"gift of wisdom and knowledge\" on that subject or idea. \"For knowledge without wisdom can be dangerous\". These classes are a great introduction to the sensual world of pure botanical essences and practical preparations and applications. Wisdom develops through the knowledge that endures and is practiced, and is expressed through action that is in harmony with the environment. Level 3 is the continuation of our NATIVE AROMATHERAPY program. A two day class and workshop. In this gathering we continue our learning about body systems, physical conditions, and botanical preparations as remedies and discover the craft of blending essential oils for therapeutic applications as well as personal exquisite signature scents. Prerequisite: Native Aromatherapy levels 1 and 2. Professionals earn 16 Continuing Educational Units(CEU'S) for this weekend of study and practice.
