Since its inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: Treatment of the whole person Prevention of disease Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health Enhancing each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontoxic therapies Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientific standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The University has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique academic degree programs in acupuncture and Ori-ental medicine, ayurvedic sciences, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, culinary arts, midwifery, integrated human biology, and counseling and health psychology, as well as specialized non-degree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. The education of graduate natural health practi- tioners and highly qualified undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scientific understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, balanced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to acti-vate, the unique self-healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational approach is an integrated one, offering traditional didactic instruction combined with innovative and interdisci-plinary problem-based learning in rigorous academic and clinical environments. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and mastery of critical competencies. Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned terminal degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical experience to classroom and clinical instruction. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case-oriented instruction help stu-dents develop practical, patient-oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to recognize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make appropriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating indi- viduals to meet the health and well-being needs of the 21 st century. Through practice and research, Ba- styr graduates will further develop ways to integrate scientific and traditional healing methods in support of the innate healing power of the individual as part of the greater human community. BaStyr uNiverSity viSioN StateMeNt As the world's leading academic center for advanc- ing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well-being of the human community. BaStyr uNiverSity MiSSioN StateMeNt We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsi-cally inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service. BaStyr uNiverSity core theMeS As an accredited university, Bastyr engages in on-going self-assessment of its programs, student success, faculty, staff, physical capacity, long-term planning and resources. That process involves the development of core themes and goals that are used to characterize the University's priorities and provide the framework for continuous improvement. As stated in its 2013 Year One Report to the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universi-ties, the University's core themes and goals are: Core Theme One: Academic Achievement Goal A - Bastyr University offers a rigorous and relevant curriculum. Goal B - Bastyr University has a highly quali- fied faculty with excellent teaching skills. Goal C - Bastyr University supports student success and program completion.GENERAL INFORMATION4 General InformatIon ~ I ntroduCtIon Core Theme 2: Research in the Natural Health Arts and Sciences Goal A - Bastyr University Research Institute will formalize a comprehensive strategic plan that articulates its growth plan over the next decade. Goal B - Faculty are encouraged and supported to pursue research/scholarly activity and dis-seminate findings. Goal C - Students are encouraged to partici- pate in research training/scholarly activity. Core Theme 3: Clinical T raining and Commu- nity Health Goal A - All clinical programs provide clinical training that prepares competent entry-level health professionals. Goal B - All clinical programs provide high- quality services to the community. Core Theme 4: Interdisciplinary Integration Goal A - Support the fundamentals of the insti- tution-wide interdisciplinary integration by strengthening faculty training, infrastructure and policies in support of Core Theme Four. Goal B - Students gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes to work collaboratively with a variety of health professionals to improve the health of patients and the human community. These four core themes align with the Bastyr University mission statement: \"We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature, and recog-nizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service.\" Education, research and clinical services constitute the founda-tion upon which Bastyr University stands, and the interdisciplinary integration of these three primary areas of focus describes the approach the University uses to achieve mission fulfillment. BaStyr uNiverSity Strategic plaN To fulfill its mission and vision and fully meet core theme objectives, the University must think and act strategically. Following a campus-wide, iterative and broadly inclusive process, the University's Board of T rustees approved a comprehensive Strategic Plan in December 2008. The following updated strategic initiatives and institutional stewardship commitments were approved by the Board of T rustees in March 2014: Strategic Initiative #1: Convene internal and external conversations that facilitate interdisciplin-ary integration, influence health policy, advance the general public's understanding of healthy living and support the University's mission to educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #2: Support academic pro- grams that are essential to a high-quality education in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract and retain highly qualified faculty and staff who are responsible for delivering quality education and support services; safeguarding academic freedom; administering a diverse range of educational, clinical and research initiatives; ensuring the integrity of the curricula; and maintaining the University's commitment to its mission and vision. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and retain exceptional students representing diverse cultures, races/ethnicities, life experiences and per-spectives. Strategic Initiative #5: Develop innovative and effective instructional delivery methods to expand and enhance the quality of natural health arts and sciences education. iNStitutioNal SteWardShip In support of the Bastyr University mission and the foregoing strategic initiatives, the University will establish and/or perpetually maintain the fol-lowing planning documentation to ensure ongoing financial stability, sustainability and intentional stewardship of institutional resources: A financial model that reflects the most current Bastyr University financial data and forecasts the economics of the University's future priori - ties. A plan to integrate financial goals with the University's strategic plan. A comprehensive assessment that defines key strategic plan parameters, evaluates risk and identifies a stable financial support plan. A long-term capital budget that integrates facil- ity needs, equipment procurement, preventive maintenance and repair timetables that are consistent with the strategic plan. A broad-based, strategically developed program of continuing donor development to achieve annual financial goals, grow cash reserves/endowments and support University campaign initiatives for well-articulated projects. An on-going plan to maximize Bastyr's annual auxiliary revenues. An ambitious but realistic program for financial investment to achieve established fiscal goals.5 General InformatIon ~ I ntroduCtIon Bastyr University has played a key part in es- tablishing the credibility of science-based natural medicine and initiating the current transforma-tion of the health care system.

NWCCU is a regional institutional accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Depart-ment of Education. Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives rea-sonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited sta- tus by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution. Individuals may also contact: Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universi-ties, 8060 165th Ave. N.E., Suite 100, Redmond, WA 98052-3981, 425.558.4224, www.nwccu.org.

STUDENTS the StudeNt Body Bastyr University students constitute a diverse group of learners. The average age of the 1,123 stu-dents enrolled at the University in the fall of 2013 was 30, with a range in age from 18 to 63. The demographics across various programs are fairly similar. More than four-fifths of the students are women. Almost half of the student body is from the Pacific Northwest, and in fall 2013, 49 U.S. states were represented. International students are an important part of the Bastyr community. In 2013-2014, 93 foreign national students, representing 32 countries, were enrolled7 General InformatIon ~ s tudent affaIrs StudeNt participatioN The major focus of student participation is the Bastyr University Student Council. The council determines how student activity fees are spent, ap-points students to various committees, represents student interests to the administration and allied professional organizations, and continually seeks to promote the University and meet the needs of students. The Student Council, like the University as a whole, relies upon student participation to create a more effective learning environment. The Student Council's constitution may be found online at MyBU. The Student Council hosts numerous events during the year, including a talent show and Bastyr Community Day. The council has made significant contributions to the University, including sponsor-ing community events, furnishing additional study space, remodeling the movement room and spon-soring the student exercise room, providing remote viewing for classrooms, as well as equipment for the library and other University departments. Each student is required to pay a $25 student ac- tivity fee every quarter. These funds are administered by the Student Council and used to support student activities, organizations, programs and services. With these funds, events like Bastyr Community Day, expansion of the herb garden, and free or par-tially subsidized concerts, lectures and workshops are made available to students. The funds are also used to purchase equipment for the University for general student body use, such as additional computers for the library, a laptop with LCD projector and video equipment. The Student Council recognizes official student organizations. For more information and a complete list of current clubs, please visit www.bastyrsc.org. STUDENT AFFAIRS The division of student affairs at Bastyr University provides support and services for students to meet personal and professional goals. The student affairs staff at Bastyr University con- sists of the dean of students' office, admissions, financial aid, the registrar's office, the Student Re-source Center, student housing, the Counseling Center, the T utoring and American Disability Act (ADA) Center, marketing and media, career and alumni services, as well as services for international and veteran students. Student Policies and Procedures are available online at MyBU. deaN of StudeNt S/vice preSideNt for StudeNt affairS The dean of students' office supervises student affairs and professional staff, plans and conducts orientation and commencement activities, advises student organizations, oversees the Student Resource Center, facilitates communications within and among the University's constituencies, and resolves grievances. office of adMiSSioNS The Office of Admissions works with all prospec- tive students for degree and certificate programs at the University. In addition, the admissions office coordinates campus tours, information sessions, webinars, campus visits and off-campus events to highlight the academic opportunities at the University. regiStratioN The Office of the Registrar maintains student aca- demic records, manages course scheduling, handles academic registration and evaluation, records grades, produces transcripts and grade reports, and provides academic advising and evaluation. The office also provides international and veteran student services. Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/practicum constitute one credit hour. Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. Continuing students register for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a registration form. The registration forms must be re-ceived before the Office of the Registrar will register a student for classes or clinic shifts. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses, beginning in late spring and after they have paid their confirmation deposit. Nonmatriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matricu-lated students. Students taking a course that is required for their major have preference over those taking the course as an elective. If a student has withdrawn from her/his program, s/he may take subsequent program courses only with permission from the dean of the school from which the student has withdrawn. Students may elect to audit a course or change their status in a course from grade to audit beginning the 8 General InformatIon ~ s tudent affaIrs first week of the quarter through the second week of the quarter. However, after the first week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. After the second week, a student may not change from a graded option to an au - dit option or from an audit option to a graded option. Course add/drop forms are available on MyBU. Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the first week of each quarter). After the first week of the quarter, all withdrawals will be noted with a \"W\" grade on the transcript (except in the case of weekend intensive classes or nontraditionally scheduled classes that have not yet begun). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (Please see the Office of the Reg-istrar for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permitted during the final three weeks of a quarter (see the financial policies section for the refund policy and page 156 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced throughout a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. (In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course instruction has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specific deadlines. fiNaNcial aid Prospective students, current students and alumni all work with the financial aid office on financial planning for their education. Students have access to a full range of state and federal financial aid programs. The financial aid office also distributes information about a wide variety of private scholar-ships available throughout the academic year. StudeNt reSource ceNter (Src) The Student Resource Center, located in the main hallway near the dining commons on the Kenmore campus, is a central location where students can obtain information and assistance about student-related concerns, details on the student activity schedule and ask general questions. Students can also obtain lockers and identification cards at this center. StudeNt houSiNg The University offers on-campus housing in Kenmore in the Student Village, which opened in summer 2010. The village consists of 11 buildings, housing 12 students each in single-suite rooms.

Counseling is also available through Bastyr Center for Natural Health. MarketiNg aNd Media The Department of Marketing and Media works to increase the visibility of Bastyr University, co - ordinating all of the communications and public relations efforts for the University. The marketing office serves to recruit patients and students to the clinic and University and assists in producing all campus promotional materials and publications, in - cluding the website. The media and public relations office is the liaison between University representa-tives and members of the media and is responsible for handling proactive campaigns to gain publicity for the University. tutoriNg ServiceS T utoring opportunities consist of free sessions in which faculty-approved student tutors provide help to students in most course areas of the curriculum. Small group tutoring workshops are organized when helpful. Audio taping and note-taking programs are also available to students. Students should make their request to the T utoring and ADA coordinator, located in Kenmore but serving students at both campuses. aMerica NS With diSaBilitie S act (ada ) Service S Bastyr University will provide reasonable aca- demic or other accommodations for students with known disabilities to the extent and according to the 9 definitions provided by the Americans with Disabili- ties Act, Section 504.

Lab fees, dispensary items and certain medi-cal procedures are billed separately. Contact Bastyr Center for Natural Health for more information or to make an appointment at 206.834.4100. The University contracts with an outside com- pany to provide a student injury and sickness plan at a special rate for all Bastyr students and dependents. You may receive a brochure with registration and pricing information at the Office of Student Affairs. You will enroll and do business specifically with the company, not with Bastyr. Also, Bastyr University has contracted with Firebird International Insurance group to offer a mandatory student accident and sickness plan for international students. All F-1 stu-dents must participate in this plan or provide proof of comparable coverage. Additionally, a domestic or international student participating in coursework outside of the U.S. may sign up and pay for this same coverage before travelling. uNiverSity food ServiceS The Bastyr University Dining Commons at the Kenmore campus offers a variety of whole foods-focused meal and snack options. During the academic year, breakfast and lunch are available Monday through Friday. Dinner options are also available Monday through Thursday while classes are in session.

The Bastyr Cen-ter in Seattle carries grab-and-go entr\u00e9es, salads and other items from the dining commons in its dispensary. health , iNjury aNd iNSuraNce Bastyr students are responsible for maintaining their health both on a daily basis and as a result of injury or illness. The Student Health Plan is a well-ness plan offered through Bastyr Center for Natural Health. It is not an insurance plan so students are encouraged to individually obtain health insurance to cover themselves while students at the University. U.S. students are not required to carry health insur-ance but are strongly advised to do so. The insurance requirements for international students are included in materials sent directly to international students. The University does not carry insurance on stu- dent health or property.

This must be done either on-line or by paper form within two weeks of the start of the student or employee's first quarter. This informa-tion allows us to manage our parking availability, give incentives to carpoolers, track our carbon footprint and offer several services, such as quarterly student bike rentals. In addition, we have a shuttle service on weekdays throughout each quarter between the main campus and Bastyr Center for Natural Health (BCNH). The University subsidizes this service, so it is only $1 per trip or $30 for unlimited service for the entire quarter. Punch cards are also available. Campus parking fees are $48/quarter for those who park on campus three or more days per week. Park-ing two days or less per week costs $24 per quarter. Carpooling two or more times per week is also $24 per quarter. Parking one day or less per week is free. These fees help defray the large expenses of build- ing and maintaining our parking stalls. Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if automatic deduction is not possible. Parking citations range from $10 to $100 depend- ing on the seriousness of the infraction. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportation information, those who do not have current Bastyr identification on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Parking fines are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically charged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking issues, please see the Campus Resources on MyBU. Security You are our eyes and ears as we all work together to keep our University safe.

Naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment by week one of winter quarter of their first year when enrolling in Clinical Skills Lab 2 at an estimated cost of $1,000-$3,000. liviNg eXpeNSe fuNd diSBurSeMeNt of fiNaNcial aid Bastyr University uses electronic disbursement services (EDS) to issue living expense disbursements for financial aid. Students receiving funds through financial aid for living expenses are required to enroll in EDS, providing the University with ap-propriate bank account information in order to process disbursements. Disbursements will be sent to EDS participants generally within two to four business days after the first day of the quarter. If a student does not participate in the EDS program, the University will process a paper check within the regulatory time frame, which is approximately 14 days after the credit balance occurs on the student's account. General InformatIon ~ f aCIlItIes refuNdS Dropping all classes by or before the end of the first week of classes entitles a student to a 100 per-cent tuition refund. An add/drop fee is charged after the first week has ended. Any clinic drops are accom-panied by financial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's office for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classes after the first week of the quarter are found on the last page of the catalog. For those students receiving federal financial aid, the federal calcula-tion for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students who receive state financial aid may also have funds returned to the state based on each state's refund policy. Students with financial problems that will affect the payment of tuition and/or fees should contact the finance office at once to make satisfactory ar-rangements. The deadline for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is later. Financial policies, like all policies of the Uni- versity, are subject to change and revision by the management and/or Board of T rustees of the Uni-versity. Notice of changes is published on MyBU. FACILITIES caMpuSeS Bastyr University's primary academic and adminis- trative facilities are located in Kenmore, Washington. The 51-acre campus adjoins Saint Edward State Park (with hiking trails leading down to Lake Washington) and includes a 186,000 square-foot building, playfields and forested areas. The campus is comprised of classrooms, research and teaching laboratories, exam rooms, an auditorium, a chapel, meeting rooms, faculty and administrative offices, and a library, bookstore and dining commons. The Student Village, which opened in June 2010, is a LEED Platinum-certified housing complex that enables up to 132 students to reduce their carbon footprint by living on campus. Visitors are welcome to enjoy the spacious grounds, tour the herb garden, and visit neighboring Saint Edward State Park. The University, in 2012, established its San Diego campus, which offers two graduate degree programs: the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine 13 and the Master of Science in Nutrition for Well - ness. Simkin Center for Allied Birth Professions also offers childbirth-related workshops at this campus location. The San Diego campus includes teaching laboratories, classrooms, study space and a library. A recent campus expansion added 12,000 square feet to the original 20,000 square-foot facility to include additional clinic and classroom space, a botanical medicine laboratory and a spacious nutrition teach-ing kitchen. Just north of downtown San Diego, the campus is conveniently located near highly-ranked universities, renowned medical facilities, stunning beaches, hiking trails and coastal wilderness. It is within walking distance of the San Diego Coaster commuter rail service and a short drive from the University of California at San Diego, Scripps Mercy Hospital and the VA Medical Center. BaStyr ceNter for Natural health , Seattle aNd BaStyr uNiverSity cliNic , SaN diego the teachiNg cliNicS of BaStyr uNiverSity The mission of Bastyr University teaching clinics is to create an extraordinary environment committed to excellence in health care and clinical education that assists and empowers individuals and the community to achieve better health and a higher quality of life. Bastyr Center for Natural Health (Bastyr Center or BCNH) is the largest natural health clinic in the Northwest. As the first teaching clinic of Bastyr University, Bastyr Center provides patient services and student training in a professional clinical setting that emphasizes a natural approach to health care in the Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle. Bastyr Center serves the health care needs of a diverse patient population, which includes young people, growing families and senior citizens from throughout the Puget Sound area. Bastyr Center schedules ap-proximately 35,000 patient visits annually. Services at Bastyr Center include naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, nutrition counseling, homeopathy, mental health counseling and physical medicine. A Chinese herbal medicine dispensary and a larger natural medicine dispensary are also available. For more information about Bastyr Center for Natural Health in Seattle, please visit www.BastyrCenter.org. Bastyr University Clinic, San Diego was estab- lished when the University opened its branch campus in 2012. The San Diego clinic was the first natu-ropathic teaching clinic in California and offers naturopathic primary care, nutrition and mental health counseling, homeopathy and acupuncture. The recently expanded facility includes 11 patient examination rooms, an IV infusion room, hydro-therapy room with sauna and a physical medicine room with yoga flooring. For more information about Bastyr University Clinic, San Diego, please visit www.BastyrClinic.org. All students in clinical programs receive training in one of the Bastyr University clinics. Clinical as-sociate deans and clinical lead faculty members in conjunction with the chief medical officer oversee the clinical education and training of students and work closely with each program's department chair or dean to ensure quality and consistency in care. Clinical training is modeled upon mentorship in a team care setting. The average faculty/student ratio is 1:6. Each clinic shift begins with a case preview session during which students present to a faculty supervisor case histories for the patients they will see that day. During each patient visit, the supervisor spends time in the room with the student team and the patient. The supervisor and student team also review patient assessments and treatment recommen-dations. Each clinic shift concludes with students and supervisors meeting to jointly discuss selected cases. External clinical training opportunities have been developed for most clinical programs to provide a broader educational experience for students. Bastyr faculty members supervise student clinicians at each external site. Below is a partial list of current external training sites: Ballard NW Senior Activity Center \u2014 naturo- pathic students; senior citizens Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center \u2014 naturopathic students; chronic disease and multi-ethnic/low income Cascade Natural Medicine \u2014 naturopathic students; pediatrics Chronic Fatigue Clinic at Harborview Medi- cal Center \u2014 acupuncture students; chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia Consejo Counseling and Referral Services \u2014 naturopathic students; multi-ethnic/low income Country Doctor Community Clinic \u2014 naturo- pathic students; multi-ethnic/sexual orientation, low income Edmonds Senior Center \u2014 naturopathic stu- dents; senior citizens 45th Street Homeless Youth Clinic \u2014 naturo- pathic students; homeless youth International Clinic at Harborview Medical Center \u2014 acupuncture students; U.S. immi-grants Madison Clinic at Harborview Medical Center \u2014 acupuncture students; HIV/AIDS General InformatIon ~ f aCIlItIes14 Mary's Place \u2014 naturopathic students; home- opathy, homeless and formerly homeless women and children Operation Samahan Inc. \u2014 naturopathic stu- dents; indigent, low-income, uninsured and underserved individuals and families in the San Diego area Providence Regional Medical Center Everett \u2014 acupuncture students; cancer treatment and pain management Providence Mt.

These placements provide students with valuable clinical experience. The combination of opportunities provided by external training sites, the preceptor experience and clinical rotations at one of the University's teaching clinics assures diversity in each student's clinical training and experience. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES This section is intended to provide students with a working outline of some of the most important policies and procedures pertaining to academic life at Bastyr University. Summary policies and procedures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under \"Bastyr Undergraduate Programs\" begin-ning on page 33. Students are advised to consult the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Policies and Procedures, and current applicable modules of the Student Clinician Handbooks on MyBU for complete information on all academic policies and procedures.acadeMic hoNeSty All Bastyr students are responsible for abiding by the University policy on academic honesty. Academic work is evaluated on the assumption and expectation that all work submitted for a grade is the student's own, unless designated otherwise. Present-ing another's work as one's own is unacceptable and considered academically dishonest. Cheating and plagiarism are considered forms of academic dishon - esty, and students found responsible for such acts are subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal. The policy is outlined in full in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual on MyBU. acadeMic StatuS - p roBatioN , SuSpeNSioN aNd diSMiSSal Students may refer to the following as an overview of University policy regarding academic standing, probation, suspension and dismissal. The full policy is published in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual located on MyBU. The University uses the following terms to denote academic status: Good standing Academic warning Probation Final probation Suspension Dismissal Notice of acadeMic StatuS Each quarter the registrar provides the dean or dean's designee with a list of students who do not meet program or graduation standards. The dean, dean's designee and/or school/department Student Progress Committee reviews each student's record according to specified program standards published in the University Catalog. A change of status, with the exception of dismissal, is the decision of the dean and/or the school/department Student Prog-ress Committee. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiency, the categories above are not necessarily followed sequentially. A student whose status is anything other than good standing may be required to sign a learning contract and/or conform to other academic sanctions. Students under academic warning or on proba- tion, final probation or suspension must complete at least two successive quarters with no academic dif-ficulty and fulfill all prescribed terms and conditions in order to qualify for a change of status. A change General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures15 of status is the decision of the school/department Student Progress Committee and/or the dean or dean's designee, who will notify the registrar's office accordingly. acadeMic proBatioN Notice of Probation The dean or dean's designee sends notice of academic probation to the student's University email address and via U.S. mail to the student's local mailing address. Notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the second week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the email serve as the date of notice. Reasons for Academic Probation A graduate program student may be placed on academic probation under the following circum-stances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below program standards. The student's GPA for the quarter falls below program standards, even though the student's cumulative GPA is above that required for graduation. The student earned a grade lower than the minimum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rotation. The student's record shows that she/he has failed a course more than once or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern. An undergraduate student may be placed on academic probation under the following circum-stances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. The student's GPA for the quarter is below that required for graduation, even though the student's cumulative GPA is above that required for graduation. The student earned a grade lower than the minimum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rotation. The student's record shows that she/he has failed a course more than once or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern.Conditions During Academic Probation A student placed on academic probation will be required to meet with a faculty advisor to develop an academic improvement plan that the student must complete in order to be removed from academic probation. The academic plan may require the student to do one or more of the following: Earn a designated minimum grade in all courses while on probation Reduce the number of credits taken while on probation Participate in academic initiatives such as tutorials and workshops aimed at improving study ap-proaches Obtain permission from the faculty advisor for taking incompletes in or withdrawing from classes Fulfill other requirements outlined by the school/ program and/or faculty advisor Duration of Academic Probation A student is generally placed on academic proba- tion for one quarter. If the dean, dean's designee and/or Student Progress Committee determine(s) that the student has not satisfied the conditions of the probation, the student will be: Given written notice (as outlined above) re- garding circumstances for the continuation of probation. Placed on suspension (see below) or recom- mended for dismissal (see below). The dean or dean's designee will notify the stu- dent each quarter that the student remains on probation and whenever the student's academic status has changed. appeal of proBatioN A student placed on academic probation may not appeal the decision unless she/he is able to provide specific documentation demonstrating a factual error. The student must submit documentation outlining the factual error(s) and relevance to the probation decision to the dean or dean's designee within five (5) business days of the postmark date of the notice of probation or continuation of proba-tion. The dean or dean's designee will respond to the appeal within 10 working days, and his/her decision is final and cannot be appealed. acadeMic SuSpeNSioN Notice of Suspension The dean or dean's designee sends notice of academic suspension to the student's University General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures16 email address and via U.S. mail to the student's local mailing address. Notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the second week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the email serve as the date of notice. Reason for Academic Suspension Academic suspension is used when the dean or dean's designee, based on input from the school/department Student Progress Committee, believes the student will benefit from a period of time away from his/her program track and that the student has sufficient opportunity to be successful upon his/her return from suspension. The terms of suspension are unique to each student and will be established by the dean or dean's designee. A suspension will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before being readmitted. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be war- ranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expecta-tions that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of that class or shift and is not eligible for remediation. In addition, failure to adhere to such course or clinic shift expectations may result in immediate suspension or recommendation to the provost for dismissal. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement. They may be required to meet with the dean or dean's designee and must show that all terms of the suspension have been met before receiving ap-proval to return to the University. If a student is unable to demonstrate that she/he has adequately resolved the issue(s) that led to the suspension, the student may be recommended to the provost for dismissal. Appeal of a suspension may be made to the provost only in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five (5) working days of the date of the suspension notice. The appeal must specify and include the alleged documented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The pro-vost will respond to the appeal within 10 working days. The decision of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. acadeMic diSMiSSal Dismissal for Academic Deficiencies or Policy Violations Each school at Bastyr University has a Student Progress Committee that follows University dismissal policy. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost for consideration. The provost makes all decisions regarding student dismissal. Except in the case of academic dishonesty (see policy #09-C49 in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information), failure to comply with University felony conviction disclosure requirements (see policy #10-C51) or a student's failure to adhere to instruc-tions, procedures and/or professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, or a student, staff or faculty member. Academic dismissal must be preceded by at least one written warning from the school/department notifying the student of the problem area(s) and providing an ad-equate time period for response and/or improvement before taking further action. Academic probation is one such warning. In the event the terms of the written warning are not met and a recommendation for dismissal is being considered by the school/department, the student will be required to meet with the Dean of Students. The provost or his/her designee will send the student notice of academic dismissal by email to the student's University email address and via certified U.S. mail, requiring confirmation of receipt, to the student's local mailing address. Except in the case of dismissal for academic dishonesty, failure to comply with University felony conviction disclosure require-ments, or behavior that compromises the safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member (which may be sent any time during the academic year), notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the fifth week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the email serve as the date of notice. A student may be dismissed from Bastyr Univer- sity under the following circumstances: After the second consecutive quarter of being on probation (including summer if enrolled) After the third quarter of being on probation (including summer, if enrolled); the quarters need not be consecutive Failing to fulfill the conditions of the established learning contract, academic improvement plan or academic probation Failing the same class twice Failing two clinic shifts Receiving three failures in the same quarter Having a history of poor academic performance relevant to the appropriate department Violating University academic honesty policy General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures17 Failing to comply with University felony con- viction disclosure requirements Being removed from a course or clinic shift due to student's failure to adhere to instructions/ procedures/professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member Student Status After Notice of Dismissal Unless a student elects to appeal his/her dismissal, she/he will be dropped from all classes for which she/he is registered at the time of dismissal. If a student elects to appeal his/her dismissal, the dean or dean's designee will determine whether the student will be allowed to register for classes or continue other activities during the appeal process. Students are advised to consult with the registrar and financial aid office regarding the timing of their dismissal appeal and its implications on class registration refund and student aid policies. Appeal of Dismissal A student may appeal a decision for dismissal only if she/he is able to provide specific evidence demonstrating a factual error in the dismissal deci-sion process. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five (5) working days of the date of the dismissal notice. The appeal must specify and include the alleged documented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days of receipt of the appeal and can only consider an appeal based on an error of fact. The deci-sion of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. credit hour In accordance with Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities credit hour policy, Bas-tyr University defines one credit hour as follows: An amount of work that achieves intended learning and student achievement outcomes through no less than one hour of classroom or direct instruction, plus a minimum of two hours of out-of-class work for each week of the quarter. For courses that meet fewer than eleven times during the quarter, the equivalent amount of direct instruction and out-of-class work is required in order to be awarded one credit hour. liMit S oN StudeNt credit loadS Bastyr University degree programs are described under each school or department listing in the Ba - styr University Catalog. The recommended didactic curriculum for each year and track of the degree program is specified. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required didactic courses. Capable students may choose to exceed the full- time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special interests in their pro-grams. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science (all programs) ................. 20 credits Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology ...... 24 credits Master of Science in Midwifery ..................... 30 credits Master of Science in Nutrition (all tracks) ..... 24 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ................ 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ...................................... 25 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine ................. 30 credits Students who are seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. Students enrolled in dual programs may use the credit limit of either program. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs. Department chairs indicate their approval by signing student registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved. Any approved in-crease may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. atteNdaNce policy Course and Lab Attendance PolicyBastyr University does not have a universal course and lab attendance policy. However, faculty mem-bers may establish attendance requirements for their course(s) or lab(s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving financial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board requirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the fac- ulty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considered excused if the student has a legitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery program students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message for the faculty member(s) with the faculty services department regarding the situation General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures18 in advance (24-hour voicemail is available). Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Not meeting the stated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's final grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardi-ness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the course grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for disciplinary action. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one given time. Students cannot attend a course without be-ing registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Attendance PolicyAll student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of Achieved Competency (AC). Holidays and emergency closures of Uni-versity clinics do not figure into the total quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a failure grade for that shift and lose all ac-cumulated patient contacts and hours for that shift. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Ex-ceptional circumstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before recommendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbooks for further details. Religious or Spiritual HolidaysThe University's policy is to attempt to accommo- date the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the information and material covered. Students ob-serving such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes as well as find sub-stitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students with religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends need to contact their department chairs, in advance, when such conflicts occur. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Work- shop Attendance Policy Occasionally, there may be professional conven- tions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to at-tend. Students who wish to attend such events must receive advance permission from their instructor(s) if there is an attendance requirement for the class or an exam or project due during that time. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must ar-range with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immediately upon return, as outlined in the policy on rescheduled examinations in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. Students must also comply with clinic absence policies. Please refer to the Stu- dent Clinician Handbooks for further details. uNiverSity cloSure In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emergencies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hours. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the Uni - versity reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or academic year to allow for additional make-up time. Please see the inclement weather policy/pro-cedure on MyBU for more information regarding University closure. criMiNal BackgrouNd checkS aNd feloNy coNvictioN diScloSure requireMeNt S Bastyr University requires national background checks for all students enrolling in clinical training courses. Background checks must be completed prior to any student contact with patients at Bastyr University clinics, an affiliate clinic, or a practicum or preceptor site. Students are also required to immediately notify the dean or department chair of their program and their clinical training program supervisors if charged with and/or convicted of a felony after the background check has been conducted. Students should also note that Bastyr University requires that all felonies be disclosed at time of application for General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures19 admission. Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in immediate dismissal from the University. See policy #10-C51 \"Felony Conviction Disclosure and Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. policy oN tB teStiNg aNd hepatitiS B iMMuNizatioNS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments. Tuberculosis ScreeningAll faculty, staff and students who work or have shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are re-quired to be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB), and are responsible to provide documentation of their results. Screening results can be submitted directly to the Facilities and Safety Office on cam-pus, room 38, or to the TB Results box, outside the Medical Records service window at the clinic. Bastyr provides two TB testing clinics each year, and all are encouraged to have their screening per-formed in sync with these week-long clinics, called TB Weeks. T wo screening options are available: T uberculosis Skin Test (TST) or QuantiFERON blood test (QFG). Students pay $10 toward the cost of their TST during the TB Week clinic, or $20 if you make a spe-cial appointment at Bastyr Center. QFG is available at Bastyr Center for an approximate cost of $110. If a chest x-ray is necessary, Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward this cost. Other locations are available with low cost options. Questions regarding TB screening or requests for forms can be addressed to the campus facilities and safety office or to the safety manager at the clinic. Hepatitis B ImmunizationsThe following people are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide docu-mentation that they have had such immunizations in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form: All ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AEAM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistants who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids). Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students. Note: All students are required to pay in full the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immu-nizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB screening shall oc-cur before the first day of work for all faculty and staff, and before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their clinic shifts. Hepatitis immuni-zation forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical courses. Hepatitis im-munization questions can be directed to the Blood Borne Pathogen Safety Officer. Anyone who has elected to waive the immuniza- tion series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. degree aNd certificate requireMeNt S To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candidate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specific academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satisfied the requirement for total degree or certificate credits, and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate with a master's degree or graduate-level certificate, the candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0. A bachelor's degree candidate must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's AOM degree program must fol-low the degree requirements of that school. A student is held to degree requirements in ef- fect at the time of initial matriculation unless legal or accreditation standards mandate a change to an existing degree or certificate program. Those degree and certificate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of first matriculation. In rare circumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitu-tions may be made at the discretion of the school or the University. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return or may elect to graduate under degree or certifi-cate requirements specified in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog with written permission of the General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures20 program dean/chair. Under no circumstances are the requirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND and MSAOM programs must complete their degrees within six (6) years. (In extraor-dinary circumstances, a one-year extension may be approved for ND students.) Students in the MSA, MS Midwifery and MS nutrition programs must complete their degrees within five (5) years. There is no time limit on the completion of undergraduate programs. Students in all degree and certificate programs must have discharged satisfactorily all financial ob-ligations to the University (tuition, fees, library fines and all other charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certificate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their financial obligations at the time of graduation, the earned degrees and certificates are posted to their records, but diplomas and official transcripts are held until the financial obligations are cleared. degree aWard deadliNeS The awarding and posting of degrees at Bastyr University are governed by specific deadlines. These deadlines affect the actual awarding of degrees. Stu-dent participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for final examinations each quarter and for commencement ceremonies are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's, master's and professional doc- toral degrees awarded by Bastyr University: All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for graduating students. Any In Progress (IP), Incomplete (I) or Partial Competency (PC) grades in coursework or clinic shifts must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be posted at the close of the subsequent quarter. gradiNg policieS Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course, rather than by the academic program in which the enrolled student is matriculated. Core courses required for an academic program will be graded according to the normal grading policy for that program. Naturopathic Medicine/Dietetic InternshipBastyr University provides a competency-based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic medicine program, clinic courses and the dietetic internship program. A competency-based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence in a well-defined set of information and/or skills. With a competency system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core com - petencies for each course and clinic shift; knows how knowledge and understanding of these objec-tives and competencies are measured; and has the opportunity to demonstrate mastery by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultation with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to earn a grade of Achieved Competency, Partial Competency, Repeat Competency (NM program only) or Failure. Naturopathic Medicine Degree Program, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achieved Competency PC - Partial Competency RC - Repeat Competency (NM program only) F - Failure I - Incomplete - Personal emergency or seri-ous illness W - Withdrawn AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptor-ships, clinic entry, theses, didactic courses and internships N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the defined knowledge, information, skills and core competen-cies and has met the learning objectives as defined in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts and in-ternships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indicates that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. Faculty determine the date by which a PC grade General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures21 must be converted; however, PC grades must be converted no later than the end of the break of the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. Grades of PC that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored into the GPA. REPEAT COMPETENCY (RC): A grade of RC applies only to the naturopathic degree program and indicates that a PC grade was not converted to a grade of AC via remediation in a major discipline within a required module. Although the student demonstrated competency in some of the disciplines within the module, the student did not demonstrate competency in other disciplines and must repeat competencies in those disciplines in order to earn an AC. An RC grade must be converted to AC in order for the student to progress within the curriculum. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. While the student is retaking the module in which competency must be achieved, the grade of RC will appear on the student's official transcript. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learn-ing objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, lab, clinic shift or internship. WITHDRAWN (W): Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing sat- isfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal emer-gency may receive an I grade by filing an incomplete grade request form (approved by the instructor) with the Office of the Registrar. Incomplete grades may only be awarded in the last three weeks of the quarter (after the course withdrawal period has ended) or af-ter at least 70 percent of the class has been completed (in the case of hybrid or courses with fewer than 11 weeks). Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must be converted no later than the end of the break subsequent to the quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete an I grade contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a personal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term-based classes within the appropriate time frame may be awarded an AW grade by the registrar. The AW grade is awarded for all incomplete courses in a given quarter. (See \"Administrative Withdrawal\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.) IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships and clinic entry courses in which work may extend beyond the end of a quarter. If not converted to a passing grade, IP grades may be converted to an F grade. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no credit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades are administrative grades and are assigned only by the registrar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see \"Challenge Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assigned to in- dicate that a student did not attend class. NS grades are not refundable, and no credit is given. AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. No credit is given, and no academic grade granted. Courses taken for audit cannot serve as a prerequisite for a subsequent course. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institution to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree ProgramsFor the undergraduate degree programs, a student must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the Department of Acupuncture and Oriental Medi-cine must maintain a 2.5 GPA in their first year and a 3.0 GPA in their second year. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures22 The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine,* nutrition, exercise science, herbal sciences, integrated human biology and health psychology undergraduate programs is as follows: A - 95 percent-100 percent or 4.0 A- - 90 percent-94.9 percent or 3.7 B+ - 87 percent-89.9 percent or 3.3 B - 83 percent-86.9 percent or 3.0 B- - 80 percent-82.9 percent or 2.7 C+ - 77 percent-79.9 percent or 2.3 C - 73 percent-76.9 percent or 2.0 C-* - 70 percent-72.9 percent or 1.7 D+* - 67 percent-69.9 percent or 1.3 D* - 63 percent-66.9 percent or 1.0 D-* - 60 percent-62.9 percent or 0.7 F - Below 60 percent or 0.0 AC - Achieved Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, out-reach and practical courses PC - Partial Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach and practical courses I - Incomplete - personal emergency or serious illness W - Withdrawn - Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, out-reach, clinic preparation, clinic entry, senior year projects and practical courses N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived For explanation of grading terms, see above. *It should be noted that while a C-, D+, D and D- grades are passing, some courses require a C grade for professional standards. Graduate Degree Programs: (MACP The grading system used for graduate degree programs is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D- for a graduate student, and the IP grade also applies to ongoing work on a thesis. For an explanation of grading terms, see the listing under the professional degree programs. For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. Grade ChangesThe grades of PC, IP and I are considered tem- porary grades and designed to be changed. The grades of AC, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F are considered permanent grades and can be changed only if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation demonstrating the error to the reg-istrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A- through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. Grade of F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F grade, or a PC that converts to an F grade, in a sequence course, the student will not be allowed to continue study in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the first week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. iNdepeNdeNt Study policy Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum, with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Office of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, pay-ment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken as independent study. One credit of independent study is expected to be the equivalent of approximately 30 hours of work. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have com-pleted at least 30 credits of their degree program. Integrated human biology students must have com-pleted at least 60 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures23 a maximum of five (5) credits of independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergraduate may apply a maximum of 10 credits by independent study, five (5) toward each program. traNSfer , W aiver aNd SuBStitutioN policy Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is required to complete the course, whichever comes first. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's first year of attendance. After the first year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of required Bastyr courses, and elective cred-its must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of the quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refund policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or transfer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expected to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the course at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petition to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approval are not guaranteed transferability. coMpeteNcy eXaM Competency examinations are available when there is evidence on a student's official transcript of coursework completed in an area of study but the competencies, level of material or accreditation of the institution granting the original credit is in question. Competency examinations are also avail-able when the age of the coursework exceeds the guidelines in the transfer credit policy. Competency examinations are not available when the coursework in question was completed at Bastyr University. If a student satisfactorily completes the exam, the student will be awarded transfer or waiver credit in accordance with the transfer credit policy. Please see \"Competency Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.traNSfer T ransfer credit recognizes coursework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. T ransfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's pro-grams. T ransfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the first year of attendance. T ransfer credit may be granted from institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies recognized by the American Council on Educa-tion Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and from institutions that are profes-sionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an in-dependent evaluation service. The evaluation report must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) accredited evalua-tion service. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. Waiver A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approved via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal train-ing, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. A student must provide documentation showing that the competen-cies of the Bastyr University course have been met. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before the waiver will be granted. Students are advised to refer to policies governing competency or challenge examinations in the Aca - demic Policy and Procedure Manual. The waiver decision rests with the chair of the department responsible for teaching the curriculum. Appeals may be made to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, whose decision is final. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures24 SuBStitutioN In some cases, students may request to substitute one Bastyr University course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of content, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and competencies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's office.

FACULTY Bastyr University's locations in the greater Seattle, Washington, and San Diego, California, areas have been tremendous assets in developing a highly quali-fied and diverse faculty. The greater Puget Sound region has dozens of higher education institutions, including at least five universities, many colleges and community colleges, medical and dental schools and residency programs. The San Diego area also has many universities and colleges that support a rich educational community and offer opportuni-ties to attract experienced and competent faculty. Drawing full- and part-time faculty from these rich educational environments, Bastyr University has brought together creative teachers in a variety of disciplines with a committed group of naturopathic doctors, nutritionists, acupuncturists, psychologists and midwives as active participants in the students' educational experience. The University's employment standards for fac- ulty recruitment give priority to individuals with both teaching experience and terminal degrees in the areas they teach. Teaching is the primary obligation of the Bastyr faculty. Faculty members are strongly encouraged to continuously upgrade their skills and knowledge through active participation in continuing educa-tion and faculty development activities. Teaching effectiveness is evaluated regularly, primarily through student course assessments, peer evaluation, port-folio development and a comprehensive supervisor evaluation process. Faculty members serve on a variety of University committees and meet regularly as a faculty assembly to discuss issues of mutual importance. Listings of 2014-2015 faculty are located throughout this catalog within each school section.

Five-year data gathering studies on the effects of iron levels on Parkinson's disease and cross-sectional coagulation in multiple sclerosis (CAM Care in MS) to find dietary and lifestyle fac-tors associated with slower disease progression are also underway. For more information on research at Bastyr Uni- versity, see www.Bastyr.edu/Research.CENTER FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES The Center for Interdisciplinary Studies offers both required and elective courses in a variety of interdisciplinary subjects. Faculty across all depart-ments are invited to create interdisciplinary courses to enhance integration among various disciplines in the natural health arts and sciences. CENTER FOR MIND, BODY , SPIRIT AND NATURE The Center for Spirituality, Science and Medicine (CSSM) was created in November 2009 to support Bastyr University's commitment to multidisci - plinary exploration of the deep questions at the heart of spiritual and scientific inquiry. In 2013, the name was changed to the Center for Mind, Body, Spirit and Nature (CMBSN). As an expression of Bastyr's mission and vision, CMBSN hosts courses and conversations devoted to illuminating the interfaces, connections and congruence between spiritual - ity, science, nature and medicine. CMBSN shares resources and develops collaborative relationships with organizations and individuals who work on the frontiers of this exploration. Its primary ambition is to contribute to the cultivation of wisdom and wholeness in the practice of medicine. CENTER FOR STUDENT RESEARCH The University established the Center for Student Research (CSR) in 2010 as the central institutional point of contact for students who desire to do formal scientific research at Bastyr University. The CSR informs students about ongoing research projects at Bastyr and links students to appropriate faculty mentors, depending on their research interest. It also provides funding, through competitive awards, for faculty-student research projects. These grants have provided the necessary support for students to complete required master's theses as well as conduct research outside their program curricula. Encourag-ing the ambitions of the University's aspiring student researchers is one way Bastyr maintains its leadership role in natural health arts and sciences research.
