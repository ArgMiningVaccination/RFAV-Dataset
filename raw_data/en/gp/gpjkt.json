For their role in the verification of data collected, we thank: Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres Canadian Paediatric Decision Support Network IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) centres Notifiable Diseases Reporting System, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Canadian Institute for Health Information W e also gratefully acknowledge the financial support received to maintain and expand the program in order to improve the health of Canadian children and youth. A summary of supporters is found in this report (page 8). The strong CPSP partnership between the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) and Health Canada's Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC) allows the program to grow in Canada and to take a leadership role on the international scene. A Special Tribute to Dr. Victor Marchessault It was with much sadness and sorrow that we learned on March 27, 2003, of the sudden passing of Dr. Victor Marchessault. We lost a scholar, a champion for children's health and a true friend. In essence, Dr. Marchessault wasthe cornerstone and foundation of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). He was a man of vision and an influential advocate for the advancement of paediatric research, both nationally and internationally.He recognized the importance and the value of active surveillance, and as a result of his tremendous dedication, commitment and influence in paediatric, public health and government circles, the CPSP was established in 1996. Dr. Marchessault was well known not only as the Executive Vice-President of the Canadian Paediatric Society between 1964 and 1997, but also as Professor of paediatrics and infectiousdiseases at the University of Ottawa and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, and President of the Ontario Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The International Network of Paediatric Surveillance Units (INoPSU) honoured Dr. Marchessaultby unanimously electing him to be their convenor effective April 1, 2003. Sadly, this was not to be. Dr. Gilles Delage, Chair of the CPSP Steering Committee, remembered him fondly saying, \"W e have suddenly lost the architect of our program. Sad as it may be, he gave us heritage, and our duty is to ensure that the program thrives.\" 3C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Federal Minister of Health, Health Canada As Minister of Health, I wish to congratulate the Canadian Paediatric Society on the successfulcompletion of the seventh year of the Canadian Paediatric SurveillanceProgram (CPSP). Such programs help to ensure that children are giventhe best possible start in life. They also provide the children's families and communities withappropriate resources to foster and nurture their mental and physical well-being. Canadian paediatricians play a crucial role by providing expert health care to our children. I wish to commend the paediatricians who take the timeeach month to complete the check-off form and return it to the CPSP . The few minutes the 2,304 paediatricians who participate in the program setaside each month have a collective impact on the lives of many young Canadians. The knowledge generated by the CPSP enables paediatricians, andthe health-care community, to improve the quality of life for children with rare conditions, educate other paediatricians and health-care professionals, andincrease public awareness. I am pleased to support the partnership between Health Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society in improving the health and well-being of Canadian children. In this time of health-care system renewal,it is important that we work together on all fronts to improve the health of the people of Canada. On February 5, 2003, Canada's First Ministers agreed to anew health plan to improve access to quality health care. Our goal is a sustainable and effective health- care system that reflects the needs of all Canadians.The Honourable A. Anne McLellanDirector General, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control I am pleased to accept the seventh annual report of the Canadian Paediatric SurveillanceProgram (CPSP). Acute flaccid paralysis polioeradication initiative.Although Canada andthe rest of the Americanregion were certified free of indigenous wild poliovirustransmission in 1994, Canada remains at risk ofimportation of wild poliovirus from polio endemiccountries. Through the CPSP's surveillanceof AFP , potential cases of paralytic poliomyelitis aremonitored. The surveillance of AFP and congenital rubella syndrome continues to be the cornerstone of the program, founded as a partnership between theCanadian Paediatric Society and the former Bureau of Infectious Diseases in the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control in 1996, serving as our nationalcommitment to major public health initiatives. The Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control (CIDPC) continues to financially support the infrastructure of the program and to coordinate the funding for several Health Canada studies in2002-2003 in addition to acute flaccid paralysis and congenital rubella simplexvirus infection, and early-onset eating disorders. CIDPC also acknowledges the importance of the surveillance of rare non-infectious conditions, recognizing that the research obtained through the CPSP will improve the quality of the day-to-day livesof every child with a rare genetic condition in Canada and throughout the world.Foreword Dr. Howard Njoo4C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S President of the Canadian Paediatric Society The Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) allows paediatricians an opportunity toparticipate in the collection of national scientific data on rareconditions and provides a mechanism for validating healthguidelines. In 1997, the Canadian Paediatric Society's Fetus and Newborn Committee revised its guidelines on vitamin K administration to newborn infants due to concerns that oral vitamin K might be associated withan increased incidence of late hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDNB). As principal researcher of the HDNB study to identify incidence and relationship ofvitamin K prophylaxis at birth, I was pleased to see the value of the guidelines with very few cases of HDNB among 1.5 million births in Canada during the four-yearstudy period. With this data, the CPSP participated in an international comparison of prophylactic regimens of vitamin K that illustrated the merit and importance ofintramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis. As participants in the CPSP , we have come to expect the monthly check-off form and realize the importanceof a diligent response. For all of us, this simple task should become an integral part of the 'good practice' of medicine. CPSP conditions are so rare that only about12% of us will report a case, yet a 'nil' report is essential to strengthen the denominator and establish more accurate incidence rates. The Steering Committee and Working Group are to be congratulated on the progress of the program. Mostimportantly, program participants are thanked for their contributions of time and effort in returning the monthly questionnaires and providing further detailswhen required.Dr. Doug McMillanCPSP Chairman I have the privilege and honour to have beeninvolved with theCanadian PaediatricSurveillance Program(CPSP) PaediatricSociety, then as theImmunizationMonitoring ProgramACTive representative and now as the Chair. Fromsuch a vantage point, I have seen the program growfrom the study of three conditions, funded by HealthCanada, to a total of 19 conditions under study sinceits inception. Investigators have become increasinglyeager to use the program as they come to understandthe merits of the scientific data collected. The CPSP is also growing within the international community, having been asked to take on theconvenor and facilitator responsibilities of theInternational Network of Paediatric SurveillanceUnits (INoPSU) in April 2003. From all outward appearances, the CPSP has been a success; however, hard questions need to be askedand answered objectively and truthfully by CPSPparticipants, investigators and the public healthcommunity. Is the CPSP achieving its objectives andgoals? What are the economies of the program incomparison with other similar surveillance programs?Does the information collected by the CPSP have thepotential to change public health policies? A formal program evaluation is being undertaken to answer these questions and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the program. I look forward to the results of the program evaluation, as I am confidentthat they will confirm the scientific and public health value of the program, and further cement the CPSP's legacy in contributing to the health of children withrare conditions.Dr. Gilles Delage 5C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S CPSP Steering Committee Dr. Gilles Delage (Chair) Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Garth Bruce Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Rick Cooper Paediatric Chairs of CanadaMs. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Jo-Anne Doherty Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Dr. Danielle Grenier Medical Affairs Officer, Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Richard Haber Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Arlene King Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Dr. Susan King Canadian Paediatric SocietyDr. Simon Levin Liaison, Canadian Association of Child Neurology Dr. Catherine McCourt Centre for Healthy Human Development, Health Canada Dr. Victor Marchessault Honourary member, CPSP INoPSU representativeMs. Andrea Medaglia Senior Program Coordinator, Canadian Paediatric Society Mr. Paul Muirhead Consultant Dr. Jeff Scott Council of Chief Medical Officers of HealthDr. Paul Sockett Consultant, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Dr. Anne Summers Liaison, Canadian College of Medical GeneticistsDr. Wendy Vaudry IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) Dr. Lynne Warda Canadian Paediatric Society Dr. Lonnie Zwaigenbaum Canadian Paediatric Society CPSP Working Group Ms. Andrea Medaglia (Chair) Senior Program Coordinator, Canadian Paediatric SocietyMs. Marie Ad\u00e8le Davis Executive Director, Canadian Paediatric Society Ms. Jo-Anne Doherty Chief, Division of Disease Surveillance, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Dr. Danielle Grenier Medical Affairs Officer, Canadian Paediatric Society6C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Presentations in 2002 (See http://www.cps.ca/english/cpsp for a complete list of presentations withhotlinks) National Congenital rubella syndrome - An international perspective: Are the results comparable?

Real-time reporting of anaphylaxis in infants, children and adolescents by physicians involved inthe Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program.Simons E. Presented at the 58 th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma,and Immunology, New York, March 4, 2002.9C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Surveillance at Work Overview The CPSP is designed to study rare childhood disorders (less than 1,000 cases per year) or rare complications of more common diseases of such low frequency that data collection nationally is required to generate a sufficientnumber of cases to derive meaningful results. When the CPSP Steering Committee reviews new study proposals, preference is given to studies that havestrong public health importance or could not be undertaken any other way. All studies must conform to high standards of scientific rigour and practicality. Upon initiation of a new study, program participants receive a summary of the protocol, including the casedefinition and a brief description of the condition. In addition to providing a uniform basis for reporting, this approach serves to educate and increase awareness ofunusual or rare conditions.The CPSP uses a two-tiered reporting process to ascertain and investigate cases: an initial 'check-off'form and a detailed reporting form. The full processis summarized in Figure 1. Initial reporting The initial reporting form, listing the conditions currently under surveillance, is mailed monthly to practising Canadian paediatricians and relevantpaediatric subspecialists and health-care providers. Respondents are asked to indicate, against each condition, the number of new cases seen in the lastmonth, including 'nil' reports. A 'nil' report is very important in active surveillance because the CPSP cannot simply assume that no reply means no cases. Participants report all cases meeting the case definitions, including suspect or probable cases wherethere is some doubt about reporting. This sometimes leads to duplicate reports but avoids missed cases. Duplicate cases are identified during case follow-up. Case ascertainment is monitored and verified by investigating duplicate reports and comparing datawith the following programs or centres: Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres Canadian Paediatric Decision Support Network IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) centres Notifiable Diseases Reporting System, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Health Canada Canadian Institute for Health Information Respondents who do not reply every month receive quarterly reminders. As well, information including the monthly compliance rates and the number of cases reported is mailed quarterly to all participants to keepthem informed of progress. Keeping the CPSP database current and increasing the initial response rate are continual challenges. T o thisend, all non-respondents (392) were sent a specialFIGURE 1 Reporting process summary10C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S were entered in a draw for one of three palm pilots. The winners were: Dr. Heather Graham (Calgary, The CPSP assures the confidentiality of all information provided to the program. Only non-nominalpatient information, such as the date of birth, sex of the child and comments on the condition, is requestedfor each reported case. This anonymous information is used to identify duplicates and is entered, as a reminder, on a detailed reporting form, which is sentto the original respondent to request case-specific information. Once the detailed report is returned to the CPSP , it is forwarded to the investigator foranalysis. The investigator is responsible for contacting the respondent if further information is required. The CPSP is encouraged by the 95% response ratefor completion of detailed questionnaires (see T able 1 for study breakdown). Participant workload Even with a total of 398 reported cases in 2002, the majority of participants (2,035 of 2,304, or88.3%) had 'nil' cases to report. The importance of zero reporting must however be re-emphasized. As studies come and go, the workload shifts to differentsubspecialties. Such was the case with anaphylaxis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in 2000-2001 and now with the new study on hyperbilirubinemiathat was added to the program in July 2002. Of the 398 total cases reported in 2002, 75 were hyperbilirubinemia cases reported by 51 participantsin just six months. This demonstrates the commitment and buy-in of the participants toquestionnaire in 2002. This initiative reduced the number of non-respondents by 21.9% (86). Othermethods will need to be devised to encourage the remaining non-respondents (306) to actively participate. See Figures 2 and 3 for reporting rates. T o thank participants for their continued support, participants who responded each month in 2001 FIGURE 3 Initial response rates (%) and number of participants for 2002FIGURE 2 Initial response rates by province/territory (%) 1996-200211C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S this study; it is important for the prevention of kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy). Figure 4 illustrates the number of cases reported by respondents in 2002. It shows that most participants (88.3%) had no cases to report and checked off the 'nothing to report' box each month. In fact, 8.5%of participants reported one case and 2.7% reported two or three cases. Only 11 participants (0.5%) completedfour or more questionnaires. It is interesting to note that 110 of the 398 reported cases were duplicates,validating CPSP ascertainment. The CPSP is extremely grateful that the majority of participants faithfullycomplete the detailed questionnaires subsequent to reporting cases. This demonstrates that they appreciatethe enormous value of the scientific data collected. T o decrease the workload for participants, theSteering Committee will insist on short, precise and pertinent detailed questionnaires.2002 detailed questionnaire completion ratesTABLE 1 Studies/conditions Reported cases Pending % Completion rate Acute flaccid paralysis 91 6 93 CHARGE association/syndrome 47 1 98 Congenital rubella syndrome 4 0 100Hemolytic uremic syndrome (3 months) 13 1 92 Hepatitis C virus infection 40 2 95 Necrotizing fasciitis 32 2 94Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection 38 0 100 Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia \u2014 severe (6 months) 75 3 96 Neonatal liver failure/perinatal hemochromatosis 7 0 100Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome 18 0 100 Vitamin D deficiency rickets (6 months) 33 3 91 Total number of cases (all studies) 398 18 95 Program evaluation The Canadian Paediatric Society and Health Canada are evaluating the CPSP to determine how well it is achieving its objectives and goals.

One-time survey questions The CPSP is available as an inexpensive tool tosurvey participants on a one-time-basis in order toidentify the prevalence of a problem or to answer a specific question. Once approved by the CPSP Steering Committee, the one-time survey questionis sent to all participants with a monthly initial reporting form. Once collected, results are forwarded to the investigator for data analysis. Results of the 2002 one-time survey question on baby walker injuries can be found on page 49. Investigators' corner The CPSP can offer investigators the use of a timely, active surveillance system to increase awareness of rare paediatric conditions among the health-carecommunity. It provides an innovative means of identifying and obtaining data on rare diseases andCriteria considered for inclusion of studiesTABLE 2 Rarity Disorders of such low incidence or prevalence that national ascertainment of cases is needed (less than 1,000 cases a year).

The number of AFP cases was much lower than in previous years, but the number ofduplicate reports was higher. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome accounted for at least 77% of confirmed AFP cases. No Campylobacter organisms were detected in stool specimens examined. Polio viral stool cultures are still essential. Background The elimination of indigenous wild poliovirus transmission in Canada, and the rest of the American region, was certified in September 1994. However, until global polio eradication is attained, there remainsan ongoing risk of wild poliovirus importation from polio-endemic regions to Canada. Consequently, active surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in childrenless than 15 years old is used to monitor potential cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for AFP surveillance(T able 5), the estimated minimum number of cases in Canada is 58 cases per year. AFP surveillance in Canada was initiated in 1991 through the IMPACT(Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) network of paediatric tertiary-care centres and, since 1996, has been implemented through the CPSP . This reportpresents the results of AFP surveillance in 2002 and compares them with previous years. Objective The objective of AFP surveillance is to identify AFP cases (including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [GBS]) inchildren less than 15 years of age to rule out paralytic poliomyelitis and thereby monitor the polio-free status of Canada. Case definition Acute onset of focal weakness or paralysis characterized as flaccid (reduced tone) without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma) in children lessthan 15 years of age. Transient weakness (e.g., post- ictal weakness) should not be reported. Results and discussion In 2002, out of 91 initial AFP reports, 39 were confirmed, 33 were duplicate reports and 19 eitherdid not meet the AFP surveillance case definition or have adequate information. While 39 confirmed cases represents a rate of 0.7 per 100,000 which isbelow the minimum estimated background rate of one case per 100,000 in children less than 15 years of age, or 58 cases, the final number is likely to beslightly higher with the addition of anticipated 'late reports' for the current year. While cases ranged in age from five months to 13.6 years (median 4.5 years, mean 5.1 years) in 2002, overall, T able 6 shows that the age distributionof AFP cases remained similar throughout the reporting period. Both sexes were almost equally distributed (males accounted for 46%). Although most Canadian children are vaccinated against polio, in 2002 only 20 of the 39 cases(51%) had documentation of a routine childhood immunization, and 19 of these (95%) had received age-appropriate polio immunization.

Virological investigation for polio or other enteroviruses A total of 20 (51%) cases had stool examination; virology was not done or the status was unknown for 19 (49%) cases. However, adequate stoolinvestigation for the isolation of poliovirus or non- polio enteroviruses (i.e., stool specimen collected within two weeks of the onset of paralysis) wasreported for only 13 (33% of 39) cases. For five additional cases, stool specimens were collected after two weeks of onset of paralysis, and for twocases dates were not indicated on the report. None were positive for polioviruses; one was characterized as 'adenovirus'. None of the 14 throat and/or 22cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected for viral isolation was positive for poliovirus. For 15 of the 39 cases (38%), stool specimens were also tested forCampylobacter organisms, but all were negative. Neurological investigations consisted of at least one or more of the following: CSF abnormalities (protein, glucose, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and RBC), nerve conduction studies, electromyography, MRI orCT scan; abnormal findings compatible with the neurological diagnosis were reported for one or more of the tests done. T wenty-five (71%) of the35 CSF specimens indicated some abnormal findings; MRI or CT scanning was done for 27 cases (69%); nine of the 27 or 33% showed some abnormality. Electromyography and/or nerve conduction studieswere done for 27 cases, 26 (96%) of which had abnormal findings. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was the final neurological diagnosis in 27 cases (69.2%), Miller-Fisher variantin three (7.7%) and transverse myelitis in six (15.4%) (T able 7). The remaining three diagnoses were myelopathy, acute demyelinating neuropathy, andcranial nerve palsy. All 39 required hospitalization for periods ranging from one to more than 45 days (mean of 11.3 days); two cases were hospitalized for 30 days or longer. Of the 39 cases, seven (17.9%) recovered fully, 29 (74.3%)recovered partially with residual weakness, and three (7.7%) had an unknown recovery status at 60 days after the onset of paralysis. None of the clinical specimens tested, i.e., stool, nasopharyngeal or cerebrospinal fluids, were positivefor polio virus infection. Conclusions The 39 AFP cases identified to date for 2002 are below the expected rate in Canada, according to the World Health Organization criteria. For the correspondingperiod in 2001, a total of 52 cases were initially17C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S reported, although the final number has since increased to 54 with the inclusion of two additional 'late' reports. The decline in the number of AFP cases documented by the CPSP over the past two years might be due to under-reporting or epidemiological peculiarities; bothneed to be further investigated. However, the high number of duplicate case reports, combined with the number of cases reported in older children and thecontinued involvement of IMPACT , may in fact indicate that this is a true reflection of the changing trend. It is still encouraging to note that the AFP reporting rate has improved since the introduction of paediatrician- based reporting through the CPSP from 0.5 per 100,000children less than 15 years in 1996 (30 cases) to 1.04 per 100,000 in 2000 (61 cases). For unknown reasons, the rate has decreased since then. Undoubtedly, theexpansion of AFP surveillance to the CPSP has improved the completeness of surveillance by ensuring that AFP cases seen at non-tertiary hospitals arereported in addition to those cases admitted to paediatric tertiary-care hospitals and reported through IMPACT .A major area in which the AFP surveillance could be improved is the performance of polio-specific investigations and timely reporting of results. Theproportion of cases where polio-specific laboratory investigations were reported remained low in 2002, with only 33.3% of cases having had anadequate stool investigation during this period. This compares with the 33% to 51% reported for the period 1996-2001. These rates of adequate stoolinvestigation remain significantly lower than the WHO target of 80%. While neurological investigations provide supporting evidence for thefinal diagnosis in the majority of reported AFP cases, polio-specific laboratory investigations remain vital for the evaluation of all cases, including those inwhich poliomyelitis is not being considered as a possible diagnosis. Negative results of appropriate polio-specific investigations are as important as apositive result would be in AFP case evaluations. The single most important laboratory investigation, recommended by the National Working Group onPolio Eradication, to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis, is a stool specimen collected within two weeks of onset of paralysis for isolation ofNeurological diagnosis of AFP cases reported to the CPSP , 1996-2002TABLE 7 Final Diagnosis 1996 0 21 (70.0) 6 (20.0) 1 (3.3) \u20141 (3.3) \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 1 (3.3) 30 (100) * Includes two delayed reports not included in the CPSP 2001 ResultsNumber of cases (%) 1998 0 34 (77.3) 6 (13.6) 1 (2.3)\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 or etiologyTotal1997 0 29 (82.8) 2 (5.7) 1 (2.9) 1 (2.9)1 (2.9) \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 1 (2.9) 35 (100)1999 0 50 (82.0) 7 (11.5) \u2014 \u2014\u2014 2 (3.2) 1 (1.6)1 (1.6) \u2014 \u2014 61 (100)2000 0 49 (80.3) 4 (6.6) \u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 \u2014 8 (13.1) \u2014 61 (100)2001 * 0 42 (77.7) 8 (14.8) \u2014\u2014 1 (1.9) \u2014\u2014 \u2014 3 (5.6) \u2014 54 (100)2002 0 30 (76.9) 6 (15.4) \u2014\u2014 1 (2.6) \u2014\u2014 \u2014 2 (5.1) \u2014 39 (100)18C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S wild or vaccine strain poliovirus.

The mortality rate for CE-DKA was five out of 23 children (22%) which is comparable to other reported studies. Survival outcome was better than previously reported with only two in 23 showing evidence of mild neurological sequelae. Risk factors for CE-DKA included new onset diabetes and low initial serum bicarbonate and high urea indicating more severe acidosis and dehydration at presentation. Background Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common complication of diabetes, occurring in up to 25 to40% at diagnosis of diabetes and in approximately5% of patients per year with established diabetes. Previous reports have found that one to three percent of cases of DKA are complicated by cerebral edema (CE) which is associated with significant morbidity(21 to 35%) and mortality (21 to 24%). A recent population study through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit showed the calculated risk ofdeveloping cerebral edema was 6.8 per 1,000 episodes of DKA. The risk factors for the development of CE-DKA remain controversial. Those implicated have includedfeatures at presentation (age under five years, new onset diabetes, long duration of symptoms, high initial urea, low initial pCO 2) and treatment factors (too rapid or inadequate fluid administration, use of hypotonic fluids, failure of serum sodium to rise during treatment). Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence of cerebral edema in association with DKA in Canadian children. 2) T o determine outcome of cerebral edema in association with DKA. 3) T o identify risk factors for cerebral edema in association with DKA. Case definitions Children up to their 16th birthday. Sudden or unexpected deterioration in level of consciousness in a child or adolescent with DKA (pH <7.35 and/or bicarbonate <18 mmol/L inassociation with diabetes and ketonuria). Any death in a child or adolescent with type 1 or 2 diabetes, either during or unrelated to anepisode of DKA. After CT scan confirmed reports of CE occurring prior to initiation of DKA treatment, patients with CE suspected at DKA presentation were also included. Aretrospective search of medical records, in all reporting centres, from 1995 to 1999, identified additional cases. T wo unmatched controls/cases were reviewed. Results and discussion Through the CPSP , active surveillance of CE-DKA in patients less than 16 years of age (population19C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S 6.4 million) was carried out from July 1999 to June 2001. All cases of DKA in children less than 16 yearsof age were identified from the Canadian Institute for Health Information discharge database. All CE-DKA cases and two randomly selected DKA without CEcontrols per case from the same institution underwent review by a single individual to confirm the diagnosis and abstract clinical data. T o increase the number ofcases for risk factor analysis, other cases of CE-DKA occurring at reporting institutions from 1995-1999 were identified through medical record searches. With23 cases in two years, the incidence of CE in DKA was lower than expected at 0.5%: 57% (13/23) of the cases were identified prospectively. Mortality rate was 22%(5/23); mild neurologic sequelae was present in 9% (2/23) of cases, and 70% (16/23) were reported as normal. Low initial bicarbonate (p<0.001) and highinitial BUN (p=0.010) concentrations were associated with increased risk of CE-DKA. In logistic regression analysis of demographic and treatment factors, onlynew onset diabetes was associated with CE-DKA (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.4-33.0). No association was found with previously reported risk factors (T able 8)including young age, duration of symptoms, low initial pCO 2 or treatment factors. Compared to previous reports, mortality from CE-DKA was muchthe same, but outcome in survivors was considerably better.Conclusions Mortality rates for cases of cerebral edema secondary to DKA were similar to previous reports, but the outcome in survivors was significantly better. Analysis of risk factors revealed associations only with newonset of diabetes and some factors denoting severity of dehydration and acidosis at presentation (low bicarbonate and high BUN). Recommendations These data indicate that primary prevention of DKA is the critical step in avoiding cerebral edema associated with DKA and its sequelae. Thosepresenting with new onset diabetes and/or more severe acidosis and dehydration should be most closely monitored for development of cerebral edema.

The facial nerve (VII) is identified more frequently with other cranial nerves and in individuals who are more severely affected with CHARGE A/S. There is emergingevidence to support involvement of the trigeminal cranial nerve (V) in CHARGE A/S. Health care for a child with CHARGE A/S can cost over $100,000 for the first 3.5 years of life. Background CHARGE association/syndrome (CHARGE A/S) is a constellation of a number of congenitalanomalies that was first given the acronym CHARGE ( Coloboma, Heart Defect, Choanal Atresia, Retarded Growth and Development, Genital Hypoplasia, Ear Anomalies/Deafness) in 1981. Over the past 15 years, the specificity of this pattern of malformations has reached the levelthat many clinicians now consider it to be a discrete recognizable syndrome (Graham JM. Am J Med Gen 2001; 99:120-3). With increasing expertise, it became clear that the criteria originally proposed needed further refinement. The revised consensus diagnostic criteria by Blakeet al. incorporated both major and minor features for CHARGE A/S and have been documented to enhance clinical diagnosis and facilitate researchefforts. These criteria consist of four majorcharacteristics: coloboma, choanal atresia, characteristic ear anomalies, cranial nerve dysfunction (facial palsy, vestibular dysfunction, and swallowing difficulties) and seven minor criteria:heart defect, orofacial cleft, genital hypoplasia, growth deficiency, developmental delay, tracheoesophageal fistula and a distinctive facialappearance. The diagnosis is firmly established when all four major or three major and three minor criteria are present. Some of the criteria are difficultto detect in infants, and as the major characteristics are rare in other conditions, the CHARGE A/S diagnosis needs to be considered in any individualwho has one or two major criteria and several minor characteristics. T o define CHARGE A/S in these individuals, a cranial CT scan may show hypoplasiaof the semicircular canals and/or cochlea and/or choanal atresia or stenosis. High resolution chromosome studies, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11 deletion and the subtelomeric deletion FISH testing help to rule out any chromosomal abnormalities accountingfor the multiple congenital anomalies. An increase in paternal age of CHARGE A/S children has been recognized as a risk factor and needs to beconfirmed. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S in Canada, as the true incidence is unknown. As CHARGE A/S presents with a wide spectrum ofclinical severity, mildly affected patients may also be diagnosed and can be followed prospectively. The review article, entitled \"CHARGE Association: AnUpdate and 1998; 37:159-74), summarizes current understanding of this complexand chronic multiple congenital anomaly, giving physicians a guide to the management of CHARGE A/S.21C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and prevalence of CHARGE A/S in Canada by ascertaining all identified cases of CHARGE A/S (old andnew). 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information on patients with CHARGE A/S,and assemble a database to answer research questions. 3) T o follow developmentally and behaviourally an identified group of CHARGE A/S infants who have been diagnosed at an early age and have obtained early intervention services.Will early recognition and treatment of these infants improve their clinical and behavioural well-being? Case definitions Infant/child/adult with four major criteria or three major and three minor criteria.

Minor inclusion criteria: genital hypoplasia, developmental delay, cardiovascular malformations, growth deficiencies, orofacial cleft, tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula,characteristic face. Exclusion criteria Exclude other conditions such as velocardiofacialsyndrome (VCS) and DiGeorge Sequence (DGS)using FISH test (fluorescent in situ hybridization) to exclude 22q11 deletion. Results In 16 months, 78 confirmed individuals, 39 males and 39 females, were reported with CHARGE A/S. Forty percent of these families agreed to be contacted for further follow-up studies. Seventypercent of the confirmed reports fall within the age of infancy to five years old, while only 15% are 13 years of age or older (Figure 5). The meanpaternal age (n=42), at the CHARGE individual's time of birth, is 32.5 years; the mean maternal age (n=61) is 29.6 years (T able 9). This is higher thanthe Canadian average of 27.1 years for maternal age and 30.9 years for the paternal age (Nova Scotia only). All four major criteria were present in 35% (27/78) of individuals reported with CHARGE A/S. ThereFIGURE 5 Age distribution of CHARGE A/S in Canada for 16 months of surveillance Parental age at child's birthTABLE 9 62 43N Maternal age 22-49Range 5.9 yrs 5.3 yrsStandard deviation22C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S FIGURE 6 CHARGE A/S minor characteristics: Comparing individuals with 4 major vs. 3 major criteriawere more females, 67% (18/27), thanmales, 33% (9/27), with the four major criteria. Alternatively,individuals with three major and three minor criteria made up 58%(45/78) of the confirmed reports with slightly more males,58% (26/45), than females, 42% (19/45), (Figure 6). Based on the number of reported individuals with CHARGE A/S born betweenDecember 31, 1998 and December 31, 2002, an estimate of regional incidence was calculated (T able 10). Resultsindicate that the incidence of CHARGE A/S (using births from 01/01/99 to 31/12/02) varies between provinces, ranging from zero cases inAlberta to 8-12 per 100,000 live births in the Maritimes. This probably represents an under-reporting of CHARGE A/S nationally. The mean age of diagnosis decreased dramatically from 22.5 months (1994-1996) to 4.8 months (2000-2002). It is surprising to note that between1997 and 1999 the average age of diagnosis was as low as 1.7 months. The current increase in age at diagnosis is a result of three casesdiagnosed in 2002 with an average age of 17.4 months at diagnosis. These three individuals all have the same three major criteria whilelacking the fourth major criteria of choanal atresia/stenosis.Further data analysis may reveal particular characteristics that result in late diagnosis. Earlyintervention is critical in children with sensorydeficits, as early diagnosis can affect developmentaloutcomes. The health-care costs for the first 3.5 years (inpatient, outpatient and lab costs) of one individual with four major criteria of CHARGE were calculatedat over $110,000 (Canadian). Inpatient costs totaled over $90,000 for the first 3.5 years, 94% of which were incurred during the first year of life. These costsdid not include anesthesia, ophthalmology, genetic testing, radiologic investigations and costs of cochlear implant. Having data to substantiate the health-carecosts for a child with a complex condition such as CHARGE A/S is important to assess the allocation of health-care funds. The central nervous system manifestations of CHARGE A/S were explored by analyzing23C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S FIGURE 7 Frequency of cranial nerve anomalies: Canadian vs. international dataIncidence of CHARGE association/syndrome in CanadaTABLE 10 Number Number of Number of Incidence per of cases cases per year live births* 100,000 British Columbia 6 1.50 39,987 3.75Alberta 0 10.66Canada 45 11.25 327,187 3.43 * Based on Statistics Canada rates for July 2001 to July 2002 All provincial incidences of CHARGE A/S have increased from the 2001 data (except Alberta) the frequency and type of cranial nerve (CN) anomalies. Of the 78 confirmed reports of CHARGEA/S, 94.6% exhibited symptoms of at least one CNanomaly. Study results identified strong evidence ofCN V (trigeminal nerve) involvement which hasnot been previously documented in the literature (Figure 7). Cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) isseen more frequently in association with otherCN anomalies as well as in those individuals whoare more severely affected with the CHARGE A/S24C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S characteristics. The extent of cranial nerve involvement may reflect the clinical spectrum ofCHARGE A/S and needs further exploration. Conclusions T o validate or improve case ascertainment in certain provinces, the targeting of ENT andophthalmology specialists in tertiary-care centres will help to identify the unreported cases. A focus on the Canadian Deaf Blindand Rubella Association may also help to identify more adolescents and adults with CHARGE A/S. The cranial nerve anomalies of CHARGE A/S need further exploration with objective testingof CHARGE individuals.

From 1996 to 2002, zero to two newborns with CRS per year were identified through the surveillance systems in Canada (0 to 0.5 per 100,000 births). Canada's very low incidence of rubella and CRS is a reflection of the impact of rubella elimination strategies. Standing orders for vaccination of all rubella susceptible women in the immediate postpartum period are essential. Background In Canada, rubella immunization programs wereintroduced in the 1970s. However, the program strategies varied; some provinces initially opted for selective immunization of pre-adolescent femalesand others opted for immunization of all infants. By 1983, all provinces and territories across Canada had implemented routine measles-mumps-rubellacombined vaccine (MMR) at 12 months. During 1996 and 1997, all provinces and territories introduced a routine second dose MMR or measles-rubellacombined vaccine (MR) given at 18 months or four to six years. Some jurisdictions used the MR vaccine for their second dose catch-up campaigns. Since 1970 the incidence of rubella in Canada has declined markedly; fewer than 30 cases were reportedannually in the past two years. During a national consensus conference in 1994, a goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infection during pregnancy bythe year 2000 was established. In November 2001, a National Expert Working Group on Rubella recommended that all rubella infections be includedfor enhanced surveillance.25C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S In Canada, passive reporting of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NDRS) began in 1979. Active surveillance of CRS began in 1992 through a network of tertiary-care paediatric hospitals (now representing more than 85% of paediatric tertiary-care beds in Canada) participating in IMPACT (Immunization MonitoringProgram ACTive). Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome. 2) T o obtain detailed epidemiological data, including maternal histories, on reportedcases of congenital rubella syndrome and infection.

Conclusions and recommendations The very low incidence of CRS and rubella infection suggest that Canada is getting closer to achieving the goal of eliminating indigenous rubella infectionduring pregnancy. Health-care providers are requested to ensure that: 1) all patients receive their rubella vaccinations at the recommended age and 2) all women withoutdocumented proof of rubella immunization receive the vaccine. Special attention should be given to assess the immunization status of women fromregions with poor vaccination coverage, including women in immigrant populations. Routine rubella antibody screening antenatally by a reliable method iscentral to the congenital rubella prevention strategy, and all women found to be susceptible should be vaccinated in the immediate postpartum period.Standing orders for vaccination of susceptible women before discharge from hospital is the most effective way to ensure that the opportunity is not missed. The degree of under-diagnosis and under-reporting for congenital rubella infection (CRI), CRS with less severe manifestations and CRS with delayed-onset manifestations is unknown. Physicians are remindedthat it is important to investigate all infants born to mothers who have confirmed or suspected rubella infection during pregnancy, even if the infants haveno obvious abnormalities on examination. Prenatal rubella screening and postpartum vaccination will continue to be essential in the quest to eliminaterubella infection during pregnancy.

Results and discussion T wo cases of CRS were reported in Canada in 2002. One case involved a non-Aboriginal Canadian-born mother who acquired rubella infection (asymptomaticaccording to her) while visiting India during the first trimester of her pregnancy. The other infant, African- born, was diagnosed with CRS at four months of age inAfrica. This diagnosis was reconfirmed soon after the child immigrated to Canada in the fall of 2002. From January 1996 to December 2002, with active surveillance in place, nine new reports of newborns with CRS were reported in Canada (T able 12). Ofthose whose status was recorded, three were born to immigrant women, one to an aboriginal woman, and three to non-aboriginal women.

The mortality rate of HUS D+ was 4%. All cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae - associated HUS (SPAH), one definite andthree possible cases, required dialysis duringthe course of their illness. Background HUS is one of the leading causes of acute renalfailure in many developed countries, commonlyassociated with prodromal symptoms, includingdiarrhea and bloody stools. Cases may occur singly,in family outbreaks, or linked to ingestion ofcontaminated food or water. Objectives T o determine:1) the incidence of HUS D+ in Canadian children, including illness caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and non-O157 strains, 2) the incidence of SPAH in the same population, 3) Canadian surveillance data that will permit international comparisons withboth developed and developing countries, 4) national baseline surveillance data for future HUS investigations. Case definitions Diarrhea associated hemolytic uremicsyndrome (HUS D+) A prodrome of enteric symptoms in a child under 16 years of age with all the following:1) Acute renal impairment with serum red cells. 3) Thrombocytopenia (<150,000 x 10 9/L) in the absence of septicemia, malignant hypertension, chronic uremia, collagen orvascular disorders. The above criteria may not all be present simultaneously. Neurological impairment maybe present. Streptococcus pneumoniae- associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (SPAH). A child under 16 years of age with: 1) Evidence of invasive S. pneumoniae infection (blood or another normally sterile biological fluid:cerebrospinal, pericardial, articular, peritoneal, pleural) excluding middle ear, sinus, tracheal aspirates. 2) Both renal and hematological organ failures defined as above for HUS D+. These should occur in the absence of chronic underlying conditions that may have accounted for renal and hematological dysfunctions. The above criteria may or may not be present simultaneously.Other organ failures may also occur. Definite case of SPAH: evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy on renal biopsy or autopsy. Possible case of SPAH: distinction between pneumococcal sepsis with secondary organ failuresand SPAH will be determined through a Delphi process.

Nearly half of the children (45%) were infected by vertical transmission from motherto child. Blood transfusions were responsiblefor 35% of cases, and intravenous drug usefor 12%. Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now recognized as the most common cause of chronic viral hepatitisleading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatic carcinoma. Although HCV infection produces a more slowly progressive disease than doeshepatitis B, it accounts for twice as many fatalities. In Canada, it is reasonably estimated that the prevalence of HCV infection is about 0.8% for a total number of 240,000 infected persons. A mathematical model predicts approximately 2,200new cases each year; 50 to 70% are unaware of their infection. Extrapolation from the general population data in Canada suggests that up to one out of 120deliveries might occur to an HCV-infected woman. Since HCV is inefficiently spread by sexual contact,The isolation of E. coli O157 or E. coli O157:H7 was noted in 67% (n=81) of the 121 confirmed cases with detailed reports. This includes one case with a mixed infection due to E. coli O157 and Clostridium difficile Salmonella group B (n=1). Thirty-one percent of cases (n=37) were treated in the intensive care unit and 34% (n=41) underwentdialysis. Moreover, 17% (n=21) of patients were evaluated for long-term renal impairment with measurement of the glomerular filtration rate. Sixchildren (5%) were found to suffer from long-term renal impairment. Eight cases (7%) were treated for other sequelae. During the study period, the mortalityrate was 4% (n=5). In two years, three possible and one confirmed cases of SPAH were identified, all of which had evidenceof oligoanuria, required dialysis and survived. Conclusions and recommendations Study results have provided Canadian baseline incidence comparable to the Australian data. Study data shows that HUS D+ constitutes a significant public health concern in Canadian children less than five years of age. This information reinforces the importance of providing educational resources to families onpossible exposure risks to E. coli O157:H7, in particular proper food preparation and food handling, especially in the barbeque season, andthe need for meticulous hand-washing after preparing raw meat and other raw food produce. Preventive measures, such as official recalls of contaminated food products and notifications of unsafe water supplies, are imperative to prevent the disease, identify cases and minimize themagnitude of an outbreak.

Recent studies with long-term follow-up of HCV- infected children have suggested that infection in children is associated with milder disease thanadults but this remains controversial. The clinical course in children is characterized by low or normal transaminase levels in 50-60% of children, less severehistological changes and a lower percentage with persistent presence of HCV RNA. The follow-up period in some of these children is close to 20 years.However, some children develop fibrosis on liver biopsy even within ten years of infection and the fibrosis progresses with increasing age and durationof illness. Thus, some individuals infected in early childhood will eventually progress to end-stage liver disease. A unique feature of HCV infection inchildren is the possibility for a limited number of patients to spontaneously eliminate the virus. Data derived from studies and observations are dispersed and insufficient to warrant adequate care and treatment for HCV-infected pregnant women.Moreover, sufficient evidence is lacking on which to base recommendations for ante-, intra- and postpartum management of HCV-infected pregnantwomen to prevent transmission to their offspring. In addition, there is little information on the natural history of HCV infection in children. Objectives 1) T o estimate the relative burden of known HCV infection among children and adolescents followed by paediatricians. 2) T o establish the regional distribution of known paediatric HCV infection among provinces and territories. 3) T o estimate modes of transmission of HCV (infected blood products/organ transplantation, mother to child or intravenous drug use).4) T o describe the current management of HCV- infected patients. 5) T o define the natural history of HCV infection in regards to date of infection with a specialinterest for HCV transmission from mother tochild (prospective follow-up from birth). 6) T o establish a pan-Canadian clinical cohort of HCV-infected children. 7) T o standardize a questionnaire in order to compare data between different regions and countries (e.g., British Paediatric Surveillance Unit). Case definition Any child from birth to 18 years of age (inclusive) who is: a) positive for HCV by RNA PCR on two separate specimens taken two months apart after the age of one month and/or b) HCV antibody positive over the age of 18 months (immunosuppressed HCV-infected children may have negative antibody tests). Results and discussion During the two years of the study, 113 HCV infection cases were reported of which 58 were confirmed, 23 were discarded, 15 were duplicates, and 17 are still pending. Among the 58 HCV-infected children, themean age was 10.30 years (0.15-18.52 years). T wenty- six cases were female and 32 were male. All children are alive, but two are lost to follow-up. Risk factorsfor HCV acquisition include vertical transmission from mother to child in 26 cases, infected blood products in 19 cases, intravenous drug use in seven,and six other less defined causes. Among 26 children vertically HCV-infected, six children were born to HIV/HCV co-infected mothers. The medicalhistory of mothers indicates that 21 women were intravenous drug users, two had received infected blood products, one was at sexual risk and twowomen had unknown risk factors. Among 58 HCV- infected children recruited during these two years, 36 (62%) were Caucasian, seven (12%) were31C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Co-investigators Steven Martin, MD, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Justine, Research Centre V\u00e9ronique Pelletier, MD, H\u00f4pital Sainte-JustineEve The Hospital for Sick ChildrenRichard Schreiber, MD, Children's & Women's Health Centre of British Columbia Lesley J. Smith, MD, University of Alberta Hospital Necrotizing fasciitis (September 2001 to August 2003) Highlights Nearly 40% of the necrotizing fasciitis cases were preceded by varicella. In type II necrotizing fasciitis cases, 57% were related to group A streptococcal infection. Excellent outcomes may be related to high rates of surgical intervention, early use of antibiotics and use of IVIG. Background In 1999, the Canadian Paediatric Society issued a statement on the state of knowledge andmanagement of children and close contacts ofpersons with all-invasive group A -hemolyticAboriginal, three (5%) were Asian and 12 were from other countries. Reports of HCV-confirmed cases come from six provinces: British Columbia (5 cases), Alberta (12 cases), Saskatchewan (4 cases),Manitoba (3 cases), Ontario (11 cases) and Quebec (23 cases) (T able 14). Conclusions A total of 58 new cases of HCV infection in children and adolescents were reported to the CPSP during the two-year study period. This number is lower than expected. Cases were reported from six provinces.There were no reported HCV cases from the Maritimes and the territories. It is important to note that mother to child transmission representsclose to half of all confirmed cases in a context where detection of HCV among pregnant women is not generally recommended. In light of this data, theissue of HCV testing during pregnancy merits further consideration, particularly in areas of the country with higher prevalence of HCV infection. Thedevelopment of a cohort of HCV-infected children of HCV-infected mothers would assist paediatric hepatologists in developing a better understandingof the natural history of HCV disease in children.

During 2002, nine (56.3%) cases involved the lowerextremities; two (12.5%) the upper extremities andfive (31.2%) the head, neck, chest and abdominalareas. All 23 patients since the start of the studyreceived a surgical procedure. See T able 16 for a listof the procedures performed. A wide variety ofantibiotics were given, but most involved the use ofclindamycin in combination with others. Overall, fiveof the 23 patients were noted to have received IVIG,while another seven patients received unspecifiedblood products. One patient died in 2001; no patientstreptococcal (GABHS) infections. In that statement, it was noted that there was no nationaldata for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in Canada. Thecurrent study started in September 2001 using theCanadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP)to establish actual national rates and epidemiologyof NF . Objectives T o define the epidemiology, management andoutcome of NF in Canadian children including: common presenting signs and symptoms; variable managements of this condition across the country, including antibiotics and intravenousimmunoglobulin use, surgical procedures, andsupportive care; relationship of varicella with type II NF; morbidity and mortality associated with NF; burden of illness for the different types of NF . Case definitions NF is a deep-seated infection of the subcutaneoustissue that results in progressive destruction offascia and fat. In general NF is classified into twotypes.1) T ype I NF refers to mixed infections involving anaerobes (most commonly Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus spp) and one or more facultative anaerobes, as Proteus ). 2) T ype II NF refers to that caused by invasive GABHS. Results During the 16-month duration of the study, 23cases of NF were reported (see T able 15 for specifictypes), age 6.0 \u00b1 5.1 years. Eleven were male and12 were female.

Seventy-one percent of fatal cases were typed HSV-2. More than one third of women were unaware of a history of HSV infection prior to delivery. The majority of cases (62%) were HSV-1 infections, which has implications for herpesvaccine development. Background Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are still a public health concern as a high proportion ofmaternal infections are unrecognized. The most serious direct consequence of genital HSV infection is the perinatal transmission from mother to infant.With limited data available, it is not possible to determine accurately the prevalence, incidence and trends of neonatal herpes infection in Canada. Datacollection is essential to better understand the epidemiology and to monitor the trends. Canadian data on maternal and infant risk determinants,morbidity and mortality will allow comparison of neonatal herpes infection rates with other countries. These pre-vaccine baseline data will be used todefine the burden of illness in Canada, promote prevention, develop program strategies, and enhance future research. Objectives 1) T o estimate the incidence of neonatal herpes infections (HSV-1 and HSV-2). For the purposeof this study, the neonatal period is being extended to 60 days of life so that late diagnosis is not missed. 2) T o quantify the proportion of localized or disseminated HSV diseases.died during 2002, but one remains in hospital at the time of this report. Nine (39.1%) of the 23 caseswere preceded by varicella; one (14%) of the sevenpatients with type I and eight (57%) of the 14 withtype II NF . Only one of the 23 patients had receivedthe varicella vaccine. The organisms involved in type I NF cases included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus , group B streptococcus, group G streptococcus and E. coli . Discussion Although the study has better defined the epidemiology of necrotizing fasciitis, some answers to the original questions remain due to the rarity of the condition. However, CPSP results suggest thatNF appears nationally and affects Canadian children with a mean age of six years. The lower extremities are most commonly involved. Varicella remains animportant risk factor preceding type II NF within a month, occurring in close to half of all patients. The outcomes were excellent and may be related to oneor more of the high rates of surgical intervention, early use of antibiotics and use of IVIG. Conclusions As 39.1% of all cases (types I and II) are related to varicella, implementing universal varicellaimmunization would impact significantly on the incidence of NF , particularly those related to group A streptococcus. Surveillance through the CPSP isleading to a better understanding of the epidemiology of paediatric NF in Canada. Continuing this study will help to better define provincial and national ratesof the disease and provide answers for some of the remaining research questions. Principal investigator H.

Results and discussion Since October 2000, 43 confirmed cases have been reported (5.8 per 100,000 live births), with fiveadditional cases under investigation (T able 17). For reporting purposes, the year of diagnosis of a positive laboratory test for HSV was used. The overall demographic and health profile of the 43 confirmed neonatal HSV cases is summarized inT able 18 for mothers and T able 19 for infants.The majority of confirmed HSV cases (28/43, 65%) were reported equally from Ontario and Quebec,with an additional 7% from the Maritimes, and theremaining 28% from Western Canada. Of the 41neonates with known treatment information, 98%received acyclovir. Six neonates developed seizuresand seven died. The overall case fatality rate (CFR)was 16% with a CFR of 31% in disseminatedinfections versus 5% in localized infections, p=0.02.Seven infants died within 24 days of birth, withdissemination to CNS in over 70%, to the liver in57%, and to the lungs in 43% of cases. The majority(71%) of fatal cases were typed HSV-2. T en survivinginfants (28%) were discharged home on oralacyclovir and one infant was entered into an oralacyclovir versus placebo trial. Conclusions With 43 confirmed cases in just over two years, the preliminary Canadian neonatal HSV incidence rateis 5.8 per 100,000 live births. This represents a rate that is closer to the United Kingdom rate of two per 100,000 live births than to the United States rateof 20-50 per 100,000 live births.

Laboratory evaluation for the etiology of the hyperbilirubinemia remains inadequate orincomplete in many cases. A complete hematological workup to identify the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia is requiredprior to discharge. Background Even though the occurrence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy is very rare, it can be associated with significant morbidity. Bilirubin encephalopathy is a conditionthat is unfamiliar to most paediatricians practicing today. In the 1940s and 1950s, bilirubin encephalopathy was a common complication ofhyperbilirubinemia associated with Rhesus (Rh) disease and occasionally with ABO hemolytic disease. With the introduction of exchangetransfusions and Rh immunoglobulin, a reduction in the occurrence of bilirubin encephalopathy was noted. Also, better antenatal monitoring and theavailability of intrauterine blood transfusion in Rh- affected women has eliminated most of the cases of erythroblastosis fetalis secondary to Rh disease.Phototherapy has drastically reduced the need for exchange transfusions. Despite this, in the last several years, reports of bilirubin encephalopathy associatedwith extremely high serum bilirubin levels have increased (Penn et al., 1994, MacDonald et al., 1995, Maisels et al., 1995). In most of these cases,term infants appeared to be healthy and breast-fed with no evidence of obvious hemolytic disease (Rh disease or other antibody-related hemolysis).one third of the infections were disseminated cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 16%. Over half of the cases were HSV-1, which has implications forherpes vaccine development. Prevention of neonatal HSV infection presents a great challenge since a significant number of women were unaware of ahistory of genital herpes infection prior to delivery.

In 17 cases, the cause of the hyperbilirubinemia was identified. The etiologies included: G6PD deficiency (n=7), ABO incompatibility (n=6) and other antibodies (n=4; one each with anti-c and anti-Cantibodies and two with anti-E antibodies). The average peak bilirubin reported was 466 \u00b5mol/L with range from 156 to 640 \u00b5mol/L. The infant with a bilirubin level of 156 \u00b5mol/L had evidence of hemolysis with hemoglobin of 76 g/dL at one hourof age. Thirteen of the 45 neonates required exchange transfusion while all infants were treated with phototherapy. Conclusions Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia continues to occur in term neonates. In a significant proportion of reportedcases, the underlying etiology could not be identified,which could be partly attributed to incompleteevaluation at the time of presentation. This findinghighlights the importance of a complete hematologicalworkup, including a screen for blood group andCoomb's testing, total and direct bilirubin, completeblood count with a peripheral smear, screen for G6PD,serum electrolytes and blood culture. If an etiology isnot identified, further testing should be guided by theBased on epidemiological studies, a number of risk factors have been found to be associated with severehyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. These include:jaundice presenting in the first 24 hours, jaundice notedat discharge from the hospital, previous sibling withjaundice, gestational age between 35 and 38 weeks,breast feeding and infant bruising and cephalhematoma(Dennery et al., 2001, Newman et al., 2000).Additional risk factors identified by laboratoryinvestigations include Rh and ABO incompatibility andglucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The frequency of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia during the current era has not been well documented. Attempts to better quantify its frequency, etiologies andassociated risk factors in Canada would be of value prior to identifying strategies for risk reduction. Information obtained from a screening program for the detectionof G6PD deficiency or routine determination of blood group and Coombs' analysis on cord blood may help to achieve risk reduction. Objectives 1) T o obtain epidemiological data about the incidence and the burden of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy. 2) T o identify the timing of presentation of jaundice, etiology and associated triggering or risk factors. 3) T o help develop prevention strategies (G6PD deficiency screening program, cord blood group and Coombs' test, and educational programs).

Only one definite case of perinatal hemochromatosis was confirmed. 'Chronic-pattern' liver failure accounted for 60% of cases with the remaining 40% being'acute-pattern' caused by viral or bacterial infections. No tyrosinemia type 1 patient was identified, demonstrating the success of early identification and treatment. The prognosis was better than expected with a survival rate of 50% overall. Background The conventional definition of acute liver failure in older children and adults involves a timeframe thatdoes not make sense in the neonate, namely \"featuresof liver failure developing four to eight weeks afterthe onset of clinical liver disease.\" Thus, the casedefinition below was developed specifically for this study. The prevalence of neonatal liver failure (NLF)is unknown, because this definition is novel and thediagnosis is not always pursued. An example of a'chronic-pattern' NLF is perinatal hemochromatosis,which is rare, poorly understood, and presents withcirrhosis and iron deposition in the liver andextrahepatic organs, excluding the reticulo-endothelialsystem. Although some infants with NLF recoverspontaneously, the majority do not, requiring specificmedical intervention or liver transplantation forsurvival. Objectives 1) T o obtain an unbiased, cross-sectional incidence of neonatal liver failure in Canada. 2) T o collect epidemiological data for neonatal liver failure. 3) T o determine the proportion of cases due to perinatal hemochromatosis. 4) T o increase awareness in the paediatric community of the various etiologies that cause NLF . Case definitions Neonatal liver failure is defined as severe hepaticdysfunction with coagulopathy, metabolic instabilityand signs of liver damage presenting in the first (approximately eight) weeks of life. There are two patterns: acute liver cell injury or chronic hepaticinsufficiency. In the 'acute-pattern', a previously normal liver suffers a severe insult, usually from viral infection. In the 'chronic-pattern', the liver is extensively damaged and may be cirrhotic at birth: serumaminotransferase levels are typically near-normal,coagulopathy is severe, serum albumin is low, andascites (including fetal ascites) may be present.Genetic-metabolic diseases predominate with thechronic pattern. Results NLF is a good candidate for a surveillance studybecause affected infants are extremely memorable38C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S patients. These infants pose rare puzzling diagnoses, and they have difficult management problems.Geographical distribution of confirmed cases wasnearly equal across the country. Notably, the ratioof 'acute-pattern' to 'chronic-pattern' cases was classicetiologies as Herpes simplex infection in two, Coxsackie B virus infection in one, and overwhelming Serratia marcescens infection in the fourth. Metabolic disorders found in infants with 'chronic-pattern'NLF were: galactosemia in one, and X-linkedadrenoleukodystrophy in another, representing thefirst reported case causing neonatal liver failure. Nochild was reported with neonatal liver failure dueto hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 despite its highprevalence historically in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jeanregion of Quebec. T wo cases were classified as severeidiopathic neonatal hepatitis syndrome and willrequire further diagnostic clarification. One case ofperinatal hemochromatosis was confirmed. Sadly, after completion of this study, a second case ofperinatal hemochromatosis was identified in the samefamily and confirmed at pathological examinationof the fetus when the pregnancy was terminated.Another finding of interest was that survival was50% when comprehensive medical support wasoffered in the neonatal intensive care setting. Conclusions No similar study relating to neonatal liver failure exists. The few studies currently in the literature are extremely interesting but feature significantascertainment bias, since they emanate from tertiary- care paediatric hepatology or liver transplant units. The relatively small numbers of patients reported areby no means surprising because conditions leading to NLF are extremely rare. The absence of tyrosinemia reports might be due to the somewhat brief studyduration or reflect the success of concerted efforts in Quebec to deal with this severe metabolic liver disease. The definition of neonatal liver failure usedin this study is effective for identifying affected infants. The study data reinforce the importance of confirming the diagnosis because with adequatemedical support, more of these infants survive than perhaps was previously appreciated. Interestingly in this study, neonatologists and general paediatriciansmade the majority of NLF diagnoses, later to be confirmed by gastroenterologists or paediatric hepatologists. Thus, raising awareness in thepaediatric community of the many different causes of NLF is very important.

The estimated incidence in this population is one in 29,700. Three new DHCR7 mutations were identified. Background and rationale Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO) is an inherited defect of cholesterol synthesis caused by mutations inthe 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene ( DHCR7 ). The enzymatic defect leads to a generalized cholesterol deficiency, and to an accumulation of theimmediate precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), in all body tissues, resulting in a characteristic syndrome of multiple malformations, dysmorphicfeatures, mental retardation, and behavioural abnormalities. SLO is readily diagnosed by demonstration of elevated levels of the cholesterolprecursor 7-DHC that accumulates in body fluids and tissues of these patients. The use of a biochemical diagnostic test for SLO has led to thediagnosis of SLO in fetuses and in infants with multiple or lethal anomalies that previously defied diagnosis, as well as in individuals who havesignificant mental retardation and behavioural abnormalities, but minimal physical features. Many of the latter group of patients escaped detectionfor long periods of time; some were diagnosed with idiopathic mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism. The behaviouralphenotype of SLO is characterized by autistic features, tactile defensiveness, and significant sleep disturbance among other features. Treatment of SLOwith dietary cholesterol supplementation has shown promise with improvement in the general health, as shown by reduction of frequency of infections,improved growth, and significant improvement inbehaviour. Families of children with SLO treated with cholesterol supplementation report great improvement in the quality of life in addition tothe physical improvements. It is possible that early institution of treatment may improve the final developmental outcome of patients with SLO; thus,if SLO has a sufficiently high incidence, newborn screening of SLO may be indicated. Objectives 1) T o determine the incidence and prevalence of inherited deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterolreductase in Canada by ascertaining all newly diagnosed cases of SLO. 2) T o determine whether prenatal and neonatal screening for SLO is indicated in Canada. 3) T o obtain demographic and medical information on patients with SLO and to assemble a databasefor demographic studies and future research use (e.g., evaluation of dietary and medical therapies, genotype-phenotype correlation).

Previous clinical diagnosis of SLO without documented elevation of 7-DHC or known7-DHC reductase mutations Results Discussion In the first two years of the study, both new and previously diagnosed cases were reported at the same rate. In the third year, however, there was a shifttowards reporting of newly diagnosed infants and older patients. The overall reporting of newly diagnosed cases remained relatively constant throughout the duration of surveillance: five newborns and two older patients inY ear I, five newborns in Year II, and three newborns and two older patients in year III. The report of nine confirmed new cases born or predicted to be born between November 14, 1999 andOctober 18, 2000 yielded an expected incidence of one in 37,100 births across Canada. This finding is in keeping with previously observed incidence in Ontario.The rate of diagnosis/reporting of patients with severe SLO falls within the expected/predicted range. Before the start of the study, 15 patients with SLO were known to live in Canada. An additional 18 patientswith SLO who were alive on July 1, 2002 wereidentified during the study. Given that the populationof Canada was 31,414,000, this number yielded aminimum prevalence of SLO of one in 951,939 onJuly 1, 2002. All cases of SLO were reported in Caucasian infants of European origin representing Northern and WesternEurope, as well as Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Slavicancestries. In addition, French-Canadians of Acadianancestry were well represented. The ethnic backgroundof the cases reflects the ethnic groups in which SLOhad been previously reported. Accordingly, theincidence of SLO in the defined population ofCaucasians of European origin is estimated to be one in29,700 births. Information on ethnicity is important inidentifying populations at risk, and in turn, identifyingwhich populations would most benefit from prenatalscreening. Overall, four older patients were diagnosed with SLO during the surveillance period. In Year I, two cases werediagnosed at eight months and ten years of age. InY ear III, two cases were diagnosed at five and eightyears of age. Cases with a previous diagnosis (and on Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome results January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002TABLE 22 Reported 36 32 18 86Confirmed 19 11 5 35Duplicates 10 13 9 32Discarded 7 8 4 19Pending 0 0 0 0Year I Year II Year III Total41C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S whom data are available) were diagnosed at 18 months and 2.5, five, and ten years of age, resultingin a mean age at diagnosis for 'late diagnosedpatients' of 5.28 years. This finding underscores thedelays in diagnosing patients with mild SLO. During the study, the distribution of cases across Canadian provinces mirrored the population density.The majority of cases were reported in the mostpopulous provinces (Ontario and Quebec, 23confirmed cases), with no cases identified inSaskatchewan, and the Yukon, Northwestern andNunavut territories. Cases from New Brunswick andPrince Edward Island were reported through NovaScotia as the local genetic centre, leading to anelevation in the case density in the latter province.However, even for the population of the combinedprovinces, the number of cases was higher thanexpected in the Maritime provinces combined (oneper 368,000 of population). In Manitoba and inNewfoundland, the number of confirmed cases wasapproximately one in 500,000. In the remainingprovinces, the rate was approximately one confirmedcase per one million of population. These variableslikely represent the ethnic make-up of the variousprovinces, as well as the possibility of a founder effectin the Maritime and Newfoundland provinces. The majority of patients reported to the CPSP and confirmed to have SLO underwent mutation analysis. Three new DHCR7 mutations were identified: two in patients with mild SLO (Y280C and I291T) and one in a newborn with severe SLO (W248R). The mutations found in patients with mildSLO are likely unique mutations. The underlying genetic background of DHCR7 mutations was determined in some of the ethnic groups. Data results on incidence supported the extension of the National Institutes of Health-funded multi-centre international study on prenatal screening for SLO to include prenatal centres in Ontario and in British Columbia.Conclusions The rate of diagnosis of SLO remained essentially the same throughout the study. All Canadian patients with SLO are of European ancestry. The minimum incidence of severe SLO in Canada is one in 29,700 Caucasian births. The minimum prevalence of SLO in Canada was one in 951,939 on July 1, 2002. Principal investigator Malgorzata J.M. Nowaczyk, MD, McMaster University, Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Department of Paediatrics, Room 3N16, McMaster University Medical Centre, 1200 Vitamin D deficiency rickets (July 2002 to June 2004) Highlights In six months, 20 nutritional rickets cases were confirmed with significant morbidity atdiagnosis, including fractures, limb deformity,poor growth and delayed gross motormilestones. The disease has been mostly confined to darker-skinned infants who have been breast-fed without vitamin D supplementation. The mothers have often been veiled, had poor dietary intake of vitamin D, and did notreceive vitamin D supplementation whilebreast-feeding. Background Vitamin D is necessary for calcium homeostasisand for mineralization of the growing skeleton.A deficiency in vitamin D during childhood is42C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S associated with potentially significant clinical consequences, as it leads to a mineralization defectof the growth plates (rickets) and of bone tissue(osteomalacia). Poor linear growth and skeletaldeformity are hallmarks of vitamin D deficiencyduring childhood, in addition to hypocalcemicseizures, abnormal dentition, and delayeddevelopmental milestones. The disease is entirelypreventable through such simple measures asensuring adequate dietary intake of vitamin D oradministration of a daily supplement. Recent literature has proposed that the incidence of vitamin D deficiency rickets (VDDR) is rising inmany countries worldwide, and clinical experiencessuggest that Canada may be no exception. This isdespite the regulated, Canadian public health policythat all fluid dairy products (excluding yogurt drinks)are fortified with vitamin D, as infants and childrenliving in Canada cannot depend upon adequateskin exposure to sunlight for vitamin D synthesis.Furthermore, the Canadian Paediatric Society hasrecommended that all exclusively breast-fed infantsreceive a daily supplement of oral vitamin D, sincebreast milk is not a rich source of this nutrient.Despite these preventative measures, VDDR appearsall too frequently in Canada, with certain geo-ethnicgroups continuing to be at heightened risk fordeveloping the disease. The main purpose of thisstudy has been to determine the incidence of VDDRamong children living in Canada by seeking reportsof all newly diagnosed cases between July 2002 andJune 2004. Objectives 1) T o ascertain the incidence of simple vitamin D deficiency (nutritional rickets) among childrenliving in Canada by identifying all newlydiagnosed cases over a two-year period. 2) T o obtain demographic and medical information that will assist in the identificationof children at risk for developing the disease.3) T o evaluate the efficacy of current strategies to prevent the development of the disease inCanada. 4) T o supply data that will assist with the development of novel public health policiesto prevent nutritional rickets among children living in Canada. Case definition Children up to and including 18 years of age with calcipenic rickets secondary to simple vitamin Ddeficiency (also known as nutritional rickets). Inclusion criteria 1) Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)2) Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase Exclusion criteria 1) Vitamin D deficiency rickets associated with underlying disease, such as fat malabsorption, liver disease and renal insufficiency, and with illnesses necessitating total parenteral nutrition. 2) Vitamin D deficiency secondary to heritable disorders of vitamin D metabolism, including: 1-hydroxylase deficiency (pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets, PDDR) Vitamin D receptor defects (hypocalcemic vitamin D resistant rickets, HVDRR) 3) Phosphopenic rickets of any etiology (where hypophosphatemia is the primary cause of the rickets, and not due to calcipenic rickets withsecondary hyperparathyroidism) Results In the first six months of active surveillance, 33 possible cases of VDDR were reported through the CPSP , of which 20 were confirmed, five wereduplicate reports, two were discarded as they did not meet the case definition, and six are still under review (T able 23). The following summary includesclinical data from 15 of the 20 confirmed cases, as data analysis is still ongoing for the remaining five.43C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Demographic data The majority of confirmed VDDR cases (9/15, 60%) were from Ontario, with an additional 20% fromQuebec and the remaining 20% divided equally among British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba. Eight of the cases were female and seven weremale, with a mean age at diagnosis of 1.36 years (SD 0.60). Eighteen percent of the cases had immigrated to Canada in the months precedingdiagnosis. Sixty-six percent were of Middle Eastern or Black descent. One case was of Inuit origin, living in the far North of Ontario, while ethnicityfor the remaining cases was unknown or not provided. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency None of the reported cases were fair-skinned. Sixtypercent were classified as dark-skinned, and 40% had intermediate skin colour. Almost half (47%) of the mothers were veiled during and followingpregnancy. Physicians reported that all of the cases had been breast-fed except for one where the breast- feeding status was unknown. As expected, none ofthe cases had received vitamin D supplementation prior to the development of the disease. Only 11% of mothers had received vitamin D supplementationduring pregnancy. Following delivery, none of the mothers had received vitamin D supplementation, and 75% of mothers did not drink milk postnatally. Clinical and biochemical features at diagnosis Bowing deformity of the limbs was universal at diagnosis, and two patients presented with afracture. Growth failure, irritability, and delayed gross motor milestones were also reported. Analysis of theserum biochemical parameters of bone and mineralmetabolism prior to initiation of vitamin D therapyrevealed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level in allcases, and PTH (parathyroid hormone) was increasedin eight of the nine cases for which the informationwas available. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level prior totreatment was available in nine of 15 cases, and waslow in all but two cases. For the patients whopresented with a low-normal 25-hydroxyvitamin Dlevel at diagnosis, the response to typical doses ofvitamin D for the treatment of nutritional rickets wasconsistent with the diagnosis. Conclusions In the first six months of this two-year surveillance study, 20 cases of nutritional rickets were confirmedamong infants and toddlers residing in Canada. Intermediate- and dark-skinned children who were breast-fed without vitamin D supplementation wereat risk for the disease. Among identified cases, the mothers were frequently veiled, did not receive vitamin D supplementation following delivery, andinfrequently ingested milk (thus eliminating a potential dietary source of vitamin D). Only one case from the far North has been confirmed to date,which likely reflects the previously anticipated under-reporting in this region, since many Northern communities are served by family physicians who donot participate in the CPSP . Significant morbidity was present at diagnosis in all patients, including limb deformity, fractures and delayed developmentalmilestones. While breast milk should continue to be advocated as the ideal fluid source for infants and children, itmust be recognized that breast milk is not a richsource of vitamin D. This becomes particularlyrelevant for infants living in northern countries.In view of our northern latitude, the CanadianVitamin D deficiency rickets July 1 to December 31, 2002TABLE 23 Duplicates 5Discards 2Under Review 6Confirmed * 20Reported 33 * Data from 15 confirmed cases included in this report44C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Paediatric Society currently recommends that all exclusively breast-fed infants receive supplementationwith vitamin D. However, these initial results suggestthat this guideline is not universally implemented.A subset of residents in Canada are particularly atrisk for nutritional rickets, including darker-skinned,breast-fed infants whose mothers adhere to a dietthat is low in vitamin D and have limited sunexposure. It is important that this study becarried out to completion, so that comprehensivedata is available to assist with the development ofnovel public health policies to prevent nutritionalrickets among children living in Canada.

Despite this fact, health-care systems have relied steadfastly on the idea of voluntary surveillance systems for the identificationand reporting of serious ADRs. The success of these voluntary systems is poor, with an estimated 95% of all adverse drug reactions never being reported.For children, the lack of reported information is particularly significant, as 75% of all marketed drugs have never been tested in a paediatric age group. Lackof information continues to put children at risk and it is thus critical that more information be gathered. This study proposes to use the CPSP active surveillance program to gather information about serious or life-threatening ADRs from a large andgeographically diverse paediatric population. These reports will help to address the serious information gap regarding adverse drug reactions resulting inemergency observation, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or death of a child, and contribute to better understanding of the magnitude and natureof the problem in Canada.

However, very little incidence data is available for young children less than 13 years of age with eating disorders.Furthermore, the appropriateness of applying existing diagnostic criteria to children has been widely debated. This study will provide both a minimum estimate of the incidence of eating disorders in children and young adolescents and a range of descriptive data on thefeatures present at the time of diagnosis, including medical complications and concurrent psychiatric illness. This data will contribute to the internationaldebate on definition and classification and will be instrumental in the development of improved age- and developmentally appropriate diagnostic criteria.As well, a better understanding of the spectrum andNew Studies in 200346C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S presentation of this disorder will help promote the creation of developmentally appropriate interventions that will provide improved outcomes for children andadolescents with this disorder. This CPSP study, using a definition and questionnaire modified from a similar study on early-onset eatingdisorders currently conducted through the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit, represents an exciting opportunity for the simultaneous collection ofcomparable international data on a condition for which paediatricians play an essential part in diagnosis and management. For this study, early-onset eating disorder is defined as determined food avoidance AND weight loss or failureto gain weight during a period of expected growth in a child from five to 12 years of age inclusively. Children with identifiable organic causes of weight loss,such as celiac disease, and obese children in a supervised weight management program are not to be reported. Principal investigators Debra K.

Yet when they are worn incorrectly or do not fit smaller individuals properly, they can cause important lumbar spine and abdominal injuries.\" Seat-belt use has clearly reduced fatalities in motor vehicle crashes. In fact, studies report a decrease of40 to 50% in mortality. The severity of injuries has also decreased. With the increasing use of seat belts over the last decades, a new association of injuries has emerged among adults and children involved inmotor vehicle crashes. The 'lap-belt syndrome' was first described by Garrett and Braunstein in 1962 and refers to injuries to the intestinal viscera and to thelumbar spine associated with lap-belt restraints. T ypically, it involves a tear or perforation of the intestine and its mesentery, which is accompaniedby fracture or dislocation of the mid-lumbar spine. Children are especially vulnerable to these injuries. Their intra-abdominal organs are less protected bythe thorax and pelvis, they have a lower centre of gravity and their iliac crests are less developed than those of adults, allowing the belt to ride up over theabdomen. V ery few paediatric studies on the incidence of the lap-belt syndrome have been undertaken. In fact,most current knowledge comes from case reports or studies done in limited regional areas. In these studies, the number of cases was relatively low,ranging from ten to 50 cases over years. This syndrome is quite rare but can be of great clinical importance. Permanent neurologic deficits have beenassociated with lumbar spine injuries in the lap-belt syndrome. The objectives of this study are to obtain epidemiologic data on the incidence and patternof lap-belt syndrome injuries most frequentlyencountered in the Canadian paediatric population.Identifying age groups that are most at risk will helpto develop new strategies that will adequately protectchildren in motor vehicles. This study should providehealth-care professionals with an education andawareness of this rare condition. T o verify that the CPSP is the best way to achieve these objectives, a survey was conducted to ensure that paediatricians see children with lap-beltsyndrome at some point during their hospitalizations.47C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Results of this survey will be published in the 2003 CPSP Results. Given the low prevalence of this syndrome, only a national study can provide insight into the true incidence of this disease, estimated to beabout 160 cases per year among Canadian children. While the exact incidence of this syndrome is currently unknown, study results may well determine that this association of injuries is frequent enoughto necessitate a review of child restraints in motor vehicles. The study will also provide data to re-evaluate prevention strategies, if needed. Principal investigator Claude Cyr, MD, Centre hospitalier imperfecta (September 2003 to August 2005) \"The early identification of children with osteogenesis imperfecta may prevent false allegations of childabuse and allow prompt initiation of medical therapy.\" Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable disease of bone characterized by low bone mass and bonefragility. Traditionally, the disease has been dividedinto four different types (OI types I-IV) based onclinical features and disease severity. In the majorityof cases, OI is inherited as an autosomal dominanttrait due to mutations in the genes encoding type Icollagen, COL1A1 and COL1A2. Recently, threenew groups of OI patients (OI types V-VII) with distinct clinical and histological features werecharacterized expanding the Sillence classification.The most reliable estimates of the frequency of OIto date are based on reports of fractures occurring inthe newborn period. However, neonatal fracturesare unlikely in OI type I, and may or may not occurin OI types III to VII. While the incidence of thedisease is estimated to be one per 20,000 to one per60,000 live births, the true incidence of OI is likelyto be much higher. In Canada, the incidence of allOI types is presently unknown. In recent years, the quality of life for children with moderate and severe OI has improved remarkablythrough the administration of cyclical intravenouspamidronate, in conjunction with multi-disciplinary(surgical and rehabilitative) care. Pamidronate is abisphosphonate, which is thought to exert itsbeneficial effect through inhibition of boneresorption. The best response to pamidronatetherapy appears to occur in children who are firsttreated in infancy. These findings highlight theimportance of prompt diagnosis and initiation ofmedical and supportive therapy during early life. Through the CPSP , the study will raise physician awareness in Canada regarding OI in general andthe novel forms in particular, so that diagnosescan be made in a timely fashion and appropriatetreatment initiated during the critical years of bonegrowth and development. Results may ultimatelylead to the discovery of new mutations and identifygeographic prevalence or ethnic specificity, such asOI type VII which is presently only reported in aNorthern Quebec First Nations kindred. Withnational epidemiological data, the study willdetermine the incidence of OI in Canada byascertaining all newly diagnosed cases during atwo-year period. Recognition and confirmationof OI may also help prevent or minimize falseallegations of child abuse.48C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Principal investigator Leanne M.

Eearly diagnosis and appropriate management can have a positive impacton a patient's health and quality of life, particularly regarding prevention and treatment of morbid obesity and its treatable and potentially fatal consequences. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare (one per 15,000) and multisystem genetic disorder. The majorfindings include: hypotonia, obesity, hypogonadism, developmental delay, hyperphagia, and characteristic facial appearance (narrow bifrontal diameter,almond-shaped eyes, and thin philtrum). As many manifestations of PWS can be managed or prevented, the earlier the diagnosis and medical intervention thebetter the outcome. Yet, despite the availability of both clinical diagnostic criteria and genetic testing, many diagnoses of PWS are delayed, often well intoadulthood. The CPSP provides a great opportunity to determine the incidence of diagnosed PWS in Canada, theensuing consequences of obesity, as well as the incidence of other manifestations included in themajor and minor diagnostic criteria. Furthermore,surveillance through the CPSP raises awareness inthe scientific community, both of the disease and theavailability of clinical and cytogenetic/moleculardiagnostic criteria. Knowing the Canadian PWS incidence and clinical status on diagnosis will allow for a betterunderstanding of the challenge to be faced inCanada, and it will help with health-care planning,particularly on a population basis.

The survey question was designed to focus on children less than 18 months of age, as this is considered tobe the target age for use of these products. This age limit excluded injuries to older (walking) children incidentally interacting with (and being injured by)a walker more commonly used by a younger child or sibling. The limit was also intended to exclude reports related to walkers used as assistive devices by olderchildren with mobility challenges. A total of 1,214 paediatricians returned the survey, representing an overall return rate of 53.4%. However, 12 forms were blank with no response to the surveyquestion, and one could not be categorized. This reduced the number of answered forms to 1,201 for a response rate of 52.8 %. Of the returned forms,84 were received from paediatricians who recalled treating one or more patients less than 18 months of age for injuries associated with baby walkers. Fourteenphysicians indicated that due to the nature or subspecialty of their practice, they would not have treated injuries of this type during the past year. In all, 7.1% (95% CI 5.6-8.6) of respondents reported treating one or more injuries related to baby walkersduring the past year. The breakdown summary of 'injuries seen in the past year' indicates thatrespondents treated a minimum of 132 childrenunder the age of 18 months for injuries associatedwith baby walkers. Many paediatricians includedcomments with their response. Nineteen physiciansindicated that they specifically counselledparents against the use of baby walkers. Only onerespondent advocated their use by remarkingthat he/she did not have a problem with a properlysupervised walker being used in a safe environment. Conclusions Overall, the findings of this survey offer a profile of the experience of Canadian paediatricians in treating injuries associated with baby walkers. Inspite of more than a decade of effort to discourage their sale and use, baby walkers continue to be used in Canada, and ensuing injuries occur. Amongpaediatricians responding to this survey, 7.1% had treated one or more children less than 18 months of age for injuries associated with baby walkers inthe past year . Clearly, these injuries are both needless and preventable. T o curb future incidents, in the months ahead, Health Canada will review options and work collaboratively with the CanadianPaediatric Society's Injury Prevention Committee, which is currently preparing a statement on baby walker safety, to consider the public healthimplications of the survey findings. In addition, information on baby walkers will be made available on the CPS Web site for parents.

A second successful INoPSU meeting was hosted by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit in York, England, in April 2002,in conjunction with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health spring meeting. The first day brought together 20 representatives from 11 of the14 national surveillance units for a business meeting to discuss communication between existing units, encourage the sharing of information betweenresearchers and assist in the development of new units. A series of lectures on the second day demonstrated the work of INoPSU. Drs. SarahLawrence-Muirhead and Danielle Grenier presented papers on behalf of the CPSP . As a result of the success of these meetings, a third INoPSUmeeting is planned for Portugal in the spring of 2004. Highlights from other national paediatricsurveillance units Australia The study of the burden of disease from hospitalized-pertussis (whooping cough) identified 140 confirmed cases in Australian children underthe age of 12 months in 2001, or 56 per 100,000 live births (95% CI 47-66). The majority (60%) of infants were under two months of age atadmission and thus too young to receive diphtheria- tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, according to the Australian immunization schedule. Importantinformation about contact with a person with a coughing illness compatible with pertussis was recorded for 118 out of 140 infants. Thepresumptive 'coughing contact' in most of these cases was familial, either the infant's parents (51%) or siblings (32%). This study has lead to thedevelopment of several recommendations to inform strategies for limiting pertussis infection in infants.Britain The British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) collected data on Reye syndrome (RS) from June1986, when the first warning about the associationbetween aspirin and RS was made public, to April2001, when the survey ended. Of the 17 confirmedRS cases associated with aspirin, ten were related tochildren 12 years of age and older. Subsequent toreviewing the data, the Medical Control Agency andthe Committee on Safety of Medicines issued thefollowing new warning in the United Kingdom:\"Do not give aspirin to children under 16 yearsof age unless on the advice of a doctor.\" A publicitycampaign will be initiated in the near future. Dr. Hallsaid, \"This is another example of the contributionthat the BPSU has made to public health and we aremost grateful to paediatricians who participated inthe survey.\" Germany An active surveillance of symptomatic children withinherited organic acid disorders (OADs) and fattyoxidation disorders (FAODs) overa TheGerman Paediatric Surveillance Unit (ESPED) sentmonthly inquiries to all departments of paediatricsand quarterly to all specialized metabolic laboratories.Newly diagnosed patients were added to thedatabase, and clinical and biochemical informationwas recorded via a standardized questionnaire. Results were published in Pediatrics 2002;110(6): 1204-1211. Prospective surveillance enrolling844,575 children identified a total of 57 symptomaticchildren with newly diagnosed OADs or FOADs instates with conventional neonatal screening, resultingin an estimated cumulative incidence of one per14,800. The most frequent diagnosis among thesechildren was medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenasedeficiency (n=20). The majority of symptomaticchildren revealed clinical symptoms during the firstyear of life (n=36), frequently presenting with acute53C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S crises (n=31). Eight children died during these crises. Notably, 47 of the symptomatic childrensuffered from diseases potentially detectable byexpanded neonatal screening programs. Thissubgroup included 29 children presenting withmetabolic crises, and seven of the eight deaths. Despite increased clinical awareness of OADs and FOADs, the mortality and morbidity of thesechildren remain high, if they are diagnosed aftermanifestation of clinical disease. An introductionof nationwide neonatal screening programs wouldchange the focus for organic acid analysis frompatients presenting with acute metabolic crises tomore chronic clinical presentations, especially thecerebral organic acid disorders. Ireland The Irish Paediatric Surveillance Unit studied theincidence of neural tube defects over a two-yearperiod (2001-2002). Prior to this, there was nonationwide reporting in Ireland. Regional reportingof neural tube defects through the EUROCATstudy, a concerted action of the European Unionfor the surveillance of congenital anomalies, hasbeen in effect since 1980. Only the Eastern HealthBoard and the Galway regions report neuraltube defects for the EUROCAT registry. Incommon with other European countries, the birthprevalence of spina bifida has been declining. TheEastern Health Board region data has suggestedthat the birth prevalence of neural tube defects isleveling off at a higher rate than in many Europeanregions. While there may be several reasons forthis, it is hoped that increasing peri-conceptualfolic acid will enable a substantial fall in thenumber of neural tube defects in Ireland. Furtherongoing analysis of the data obtained over the two-year period will help to elucidate the folic acidintake of mothers of babies with neural tube defect,as well as determine other factors that may beassociated.Latvia The active mailing of a surveillance card has recently been adopted by the Latvian Paediatric Surveillance Unit. With a child population of 429,000, Latvia hasonly two major children's hospitals. Cards have been sent to comparatively few clinicians. Response rates are currently around 70%. Malaysia The Malaysian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (MPSU) is pleased to have a new basic infrastructure. A financial grant was secured from the MalaysianPaediatric Association to fund a permanent research officer and establish an executive, as well as scientific and advisory committees. There has been a tremendous increase in the number of new paediatricians in Malaysia due to the successof the paediatric specialty training program in Malaysia. This will necessitate an update of the MPSU database. Also, since the MPSU has beensuspended since 1999, many respondents, especially the new paediatricians, will need time to familiarize themselves with the new cards. For these reasons, anaccurate measure of response rates is not possible at this time. The MPSU is confident of the success of the program with this new infrastructure andleadership. Netherlands The study of atypical mycobacterial infections andtherapy (surgery and/or medical) was a highlight ofthe year. Follow-up immunological investigations are planned for these patients. A second highlight was medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.In the northern region, tandem mass spectrometry was added to the neonatal screening program to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of thisscreening tool. New Zealand In 2002, the New Zealand Paediatric SurveilanceUnit (NZPSU) undertook an audit of all acute flaccid54C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S paralysis (AFP) cases in 2000 and 2001 in an attempt to assess the unit's sensitivity. The audit was performed utilizing a search of the New Zealand HealthInformation Service (NZHIS) hospital discharge database for all children less than 15 years of age with a discharge diagnosis code (ICD-10) consistent withAFP , specifically 357.0 (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 diseases of centralnervous system, which includes transverse myelitis). Out of a total of 25 cases that met the criteria, 16 had already been reported to the unit. For the remaining nine cases, a contact person at each of the hospitals was sent a letter explaining the purpose of the inquiryand a short questionnaire to assess whether the child actually fit the criteria for AFP . Of these nine cases, only two were true AFP cases - both Guillain-Barr\u00e9syndrome. Of the remaining seven, six were hospital coding mistakes, and one was a sequelae of polio that had been diagnosed in another country before comingto New Zealand. The Venn diagram (Figure 9) shows that of the total 27 cases detected by either the NZPSU or NZHIS, 25 (93%) were detected by the NZPSU system, 18 (67%) by the NZHIS, and 16 (59%) by both. The reasonswhy the cases were missed by the NZPSU or NZHIS systems were not explored directly. However, one child not notified to the NZPSU had been referred from asecondary- to a tertiary-care hospital. The sensitivity of the NZPSU system was found to be around 93%, much better than that for most notifiablediseases. Thus, the established process is picking up most cases of AFP . The NZPSU will however continue to remind paediatricians of the importance of timely reporting of cases. Papua New Guinea Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus data (IDDM)collected by the Papua New Guinea (PNG)Paediatric Surveillance Unit was published in the PNG Medical Journal. There was an extremely low incidence (0.08 per 100,000) of IDDM T ype I inchildren under 15 years of age. Portugal In the first 18 months, activity for the PortuguesePaediatric Surveillance Unit (PPSU) was clearly verypositive. During this period, the PPSU confirmed four cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, 18 cases of Kawasaki disease, 30 cases of diabetes in childrenunder five years of age, and 83 cases of group B streptococcal infection in infants less than three months of age. While the reporting rate is lower than in other national surveillance units, much of this can beattributed to the uniqueness of this initiative. Improvement is expected once the potential of the system is realized and the scientific value is reinforcedthrough the publication of current study results. The temporal relation between the improvement of the participation rate and the first public presentationof preliminary data at the 27th National Paediatric Conference (May 2002), reveals sensitivity and interest from paediatricians in the PPSU. Switzerland A study on intussusception started in April 2003. Study results will capture the medical burden (based on kind of complications occurring) and the financialimplications (based on frequency and duration of hospitalization) caused by intussusception. No such data are currently available for Switzerland.Furthermore, the findings of this surveillance project will establish a background rate of intussusception inFIGURE 10 Cases of AFP from NZHIS and NZPSU 9 2 16NZHIS NZPSU55C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S this country. With a new rotavirus vaccine on the horizon, pre-vaccine intussuception data will allow for the possibility of a comparison study after vaccine release. Wales It would be difficult to say with any exactness the date on which paediatric palliative care began to develop in the United Kingdom (UK). There are many candidates: the appearance of articles on thesubject in the British Medical Journal in the late 1970s, the first children's hospice in the early 1980s, or perhaps the appointment of the first palliativecare paediatrician in 1986. Certainly one turning point was the publication of Guidelines for the Development of Paediatric PalliativeCare Services in 1997. The Guidelines, one of the first publications of the newly-formed Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, were drawn up inpartnership with ACT (Association for Children with Life-threatening or T erminal Conditions and their Families), the umbrella group in the UK (andincreasingly in Europe) for agencies working in paediatric palliative care. For the first time, the profession of paediatrics was taking palliative careseriously. Every paediatrician in the four countries that make up the United Kingdom received a copy. The purpose of the Welsh Paediatric Surveillance Unit (WPSU) study was to ask the question: in the years that have elapsed since it appeared, how muchof that ground-breaking publication has become part of paediatric culture in Wales? Four years later, what is palliative care in children understood to be?During 2001 and 2002, every paediatrician in Wales received a monthly card asking \"Have you seen any child who, in your opinion, had palliative careneeds?\" Those who reported that they had seen such a child received a more detailed questionnaire enquiring about the nature of the perceived need,which could range from physical symptom control through respite to discussing prognosis and bereavement counselling.The results were interesting. Only a small proportion - perhaps as little as 20% - of children who, according to data in the Guidelines, were likely to need palliative care were reported by paediatriciansin Wales. However, those paediatricians who did recognize and report it also recognized the multidimensional ('holistic') nature of those needs.This contradicts the view that the doctors' role in palliative care in children is limited to the diagnosis and management of physical symptoms, or thatpaediatricians do not recognize the need for working closely with other disciplines and professions. On the other hand, it also suggests that, despite theRCPCH/ACT document, many paediatricians do not yet fully understand what is meant by 'palliative care' in children. The survey will be published, and hopefully, this in itself will help to raise awareness. Perhapseven more importantly, the data will help in the development of the next edition of the Guidelines, to be published later this year (www.act.org.uk),which in turn will influence policy all over the UK and indeed the world. The WPSU study has provided a unique opportunity to assess theeffectiveness of communicating to paediatricians the nature of, and need for, palliative care in children.56C P S P 2 0 0 2 R E S U L T S Call for New Studies Research opportunities Wanted: Investigators to initiate new CPSP studies on rare diseases or conditions for 2004 and beyond.
