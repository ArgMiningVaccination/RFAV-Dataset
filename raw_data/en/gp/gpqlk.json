Western medicine is the traditional healthcare you receive in the United States. It's the care you receive when you go to a doctor's office, medical clinic, hospital or urgent care. This type of medical care uses techniques based on scientific evidence. Healthcare providers rely on proven methods to diagnose and treat conditions and improve your overall health. Medical schools in the U.S. primarily teach Western medicine. Today, Western medicine is the most common type of healthcare in the United States and much of the world. What is the definition of Western medicine? Western medicine has its roots in the Western part of the world, namely Greece. Experts credit the Greek physician Hippocrates as being the father of Western medicine. Hippocrates and Hippocratic physicians believed that illnesses were the result of imbalances between blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm (what they called \"the humors\"). These physicians looked for bodily causes of illnesses. Their treatments focused on restoring this humoral balance. What are other names for Western medicine?

What is the difference between Western medicine and Chinese (Eastern) medicine? Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) focuses on a vital life force energy called Qi or Chi. Practitioners of Chinese medicine believe that illness occurs when there's an imbalance between yin and yang. These are the components that make up your life force. Chinese medicine is also known as Eastern medicine or East Asian medicine. This is because it has its roots in the Eastern part of the world, namely China. Although Chinese medicine is more than 3,000 years old, it is not well-researched. Compared to Western medicine practices, there are fewer scientific studies supporting its effectiveness. There are evidence-based findings in support of some Chinese medicine practices. That's why some Western medicine practitioners incorporate them as complementary therapy.
