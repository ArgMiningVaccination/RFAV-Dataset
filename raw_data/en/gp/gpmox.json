But [Novartis](http://www.forbes.com/companies/novartis/), the $59 billion drug giant that got into the vaccine business in a big way with its $5 billion purchase of Chiron in 2005, is finding that getting meningitis shots to market is tougher than it sounds. Worse, even when they are approved for sale, it is not clear that they will be widely recommended - a necessity if they are going to be sales successes or have a big medical impact. Andrin Oswald, the 42-year-old doctor who runs Novartis' vaccine division, is unfazed. \"I don't think once we have a safe and effective way to protect children from dying, that that vaccine would not be used in the public health,\" he said in an interview late last year. Novartis is attacking meningitis on two fronts. First, it is creating an infant version of its existing vaccine for meningitis, Menveo, which is given to adolescents. It protects against the strains of the meningococcal bacteria that are prevalent in the U.S. Second, it is developing Bexsero, the first vaccine against the B strain of the meningococcal bacteria that is prevalent in Europe and Britain. Men B causes 20,000 to 80,000 brain infections worldwide every year, killing 10% of its victims. The first problem: the Food and Drug Administration was expected to approved the infant form of Menveo on February 10, but it unexpectedly rejected the vaccine instead. The exact reasons are confidential, because the FDA considers communications on unapproved drugs confidential.) That gives a leg up to rival Sanofi, whose own meningitis shot, Menactra, is only approved in infants 9 months and older. But the bigger problem is that once the vaccine is approved, it needs to be recommended by the Advisory Committee On Immunization Practices (ACIP) convened by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. And it may not be recommended. When Novartis and Sanofi started developing their meningicoccal vaccines, experts in the U.S. believed that they were in dire need of the shots. But since then, the rate of infection has plummeted - making it harder to justify. \"The US is in a tough position,\" says Amy Cohn, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control. \"We're currently having the lowest rate of meningococcal disease that we've ever had historically. And as these infant vaccines are becoming available, the amount of disease that they will prevent is minimal.\" When [Pfizer](http://www.forbes.com/companies/pfizer/)'s pneumococcal vaccine, Prevnar, was first approved in 2000, it prevented thousands of cases of brain and bloodstream infections due to that bacteria, and also cut down on everything from ear infections to pneumonia. But meningicoccal disease doesn't cause these more common infections -only the rare, but devastating, brain infection. Another problem is that it takes infants time and several shots to build up immunity - so some vaccinated children will still get the disease. Between 1998 and 2007, the rate of meningicoccal meningitis in the U.S. plunged 50% to about [1 in one million people](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1005384). While other forms of meningitis dropped because of new vaccines against the pneumococcus and haemophilus influenza B (HIB) bacteria, the reason for the drop in these bacteria remains mysterious. In 2008, the ACIP committee [voted not to recommend](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5717a4.htm) Sanofi's Menactra meningitis vaccine in children aged two to 10 years old because the 160 cases and 15 deaths that would be prevented did not justify the costs and risks of a full scaled vaccine campaign. ACIP [recommends Menactra in toddlers](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6040a4.htm) only when they are at heightened risk for meningitis because of illness or travel to countries where meningitis rates are higher. But meningitis infection is most common in young infants. Novartis' Oswald argues that it is a mistake to wait until meningicoccal infections spike again to start giving babies a vaccine. For Novartis, the biggest opportunity is in the B form of meningitis, and its new vaccine, Bexsero. The Bexsero vaccine is the result of using cutting edge genetic science to attack the bacteria. Most meningicoccal vaccines work by taking proteins from the surface of the bacteria and linking them to another compound that the immune system will recognize and attack. In this way, they develop immunity against the germ, too. But not meningitis B. \"You cannot develop a vaccine through traditional methods,\" says Oswald. So Novartis worked with scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute to find multiple proteins that the immune system would be capable of attacking. The vaccine is expected to reach the European market next year. Results showing that it is effective at producing an immune response in teenagers were published in the Lancet earlier this year, and another study showing a benefit in infants was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Bexsero's innovative nature works against it, says the CDC's Cohen, who wrote an editorial about it in JAMA. Because it's not like the other meningitis vaccines, nobody knows for sure whether it will prevent people from carrying the bacteria in their noses, where they lurk unseen, or provide herd immunity, protecting people who haven't gotten their shots. Nor is it known if there will be booster shots needed. There is reason to race. Novartis' vaccine division swings between profitable and unprofitable years because its main business is making influenza vaccine. In 2010, when people were scared of swine flu, sales were about $2.9 billion according to analysts; last year they were just $1.9 billion. Bexsero is expected to make the division profitable. And there is competition: Pfizer is in the late stages of developing its own meningitis B vaccine. For the first company to develop a combination of existing meningitis vaccines and the B form, there may be an added prize, says Paul Offit, the noted immunologist at Children's Hospital of [Philadelphia](http://www.forbes.com/places/pa/philadelphia/). Such a combo shot would have a very strong chance of becoming a standard infant vaccination. "}
