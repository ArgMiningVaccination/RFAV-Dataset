We use primary data from 326 respondents from Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 2008-2009, selected using purposive, venue-based sampling across two st rata. Participants completed a structured questionnaire a nd full rank discrete choice modelling task administered using computer-assisted personal interviewing. The choice experiment was used to rank eight hypothetical HIV vaccine scenar ios, with each scenario comprising seven attributes (including cost) each of which had two levels. The data were analyzed in two alternative specifications: (1) best-worst; and (2) full-rank, us ing logit likelihood functions estimated with custom routines in Gauss matrix programming language. In the full-rank specification, all vaccine attributes are significant predicto rs of probability of vaccine choice. The biomedical attributes of the hypothetical HIV v accine (efficacy, absence of VISP, absence of side effects, and duration of effect) are the most important attributes for HIV vaccine choice. On average respondents ar e more than twice as likely to accept a vaccine with 99% efficacy, than a vaccine with 50% efficacy. This translates to a willingness to pay US$383 more for a high efficacy vaccine compared with the low efficacy vaccine. Knowledge of the relative importance of dete rminants of HIV vaccine acceptability is important to ensure the success of future vacc ination programs. Future acceptability studies of hypothetical HIV vaccines should use more fine ly-grained biomedical attributes, and could also improve the external validity of results by including more levels of the cost attribute.

Introduction A safe, efficacious and accessibl e prophylactic vaccine for HIV remains elusive despite promising results in some recent trials [1-3]. Nevertheless, with an estimated 2.5 million new HIV infections each year [4], a vaccine is the most promising means of controlling the epidemic. Ongoing research on candidate vaccine s will continue to require the support of thousands of volunteers for enrolment in Phase II and Phase III vaccine trials. An increasing focus on implementation science in health care, and recognition of the significant gap between efficacy in clinical trials and effectiv eness in the real world in the case of already licensed vaccines (e.g., HBV, HPV) , also raises the importance of research that looks beyond clinical trials [5-6]. To date there have been relatively few investigations of the potential uptake of future HIV vaccines, particularly out side the United States [7]. An understanding of the factors associated with vacc ine acceptability, particularly within high-risk groups, and the vaccine attributes or characteri stics that contribute to acceptab ility, is important to ensure uptake of a future vaccine. Vaccine acceptability is a m easure of potential users' judgment of the satisfactoriness of the vaccine and their willingness to be vaccin ated [7]. In quantitative studies, vaccine acceptability is typically measured as a dichot omous yes/no response to a willingness to be vaccinated question (e.g. see [8-9]), or measured on a Likert scale (e.g. see [10-11]) or as a probability of accepting vacci nation (e.g. see [12-13]). An alternative to investigating vaccine acceptabi lity is to directly consider the willingness- to-pay (henceforth WTP) for it by potential recipients. Few studi es have adopted a contingent valuation approach to estimate WTP for hypothe tical HIV vaccines (e.g. see [14-16]). This approach involves presenting the respondents with one or a small number of scenarios that include a price for a hypothetical vaccine of given attributes, then adjusting the price in several steps in order to determine the respondent's maximum willingness-to-pay for each vaccine scenario [17]. The advantage of these st udies is that they provide a more direct way to estimate the potential demand for a future HIV vaccine, rather than simply the vaccine's acceptability; more work of this type is clearly needed [18]. In most studies of vaccine acceptability, th e vaccine-specific attributes determining its acceptability are typically investigated by pres enting each survey respondent with a number of different vaccine alternatives , each of which has different attributes. Some studies have presented a limited number of scenarios with few vaccine attributes (e.g. see [19]), but most have used a more complex experimental desi gn involving conjoint va lue analysis (e.g. see [11,20,21]). In conjoint value anal ysis, the respondent is presente d with a series of cards, each of which describes an alternative hypotheti cal vaccine on the basis of its attributes. Respondents disclose their preferences by orderi ng the cards (alternative vaccines) from best to worst. They are then asked to rate the scenario on each card in terms of acceptability, using one of the measures noted above. 4 To investigate the determinants of vaccine acceptability, most studies then convert the vaccine acceptability vari able into either a linear form for ordinary least squares regression analysis (e.g. see [22-23]) or in to a dichotomous variable for l ogistic regression analysis (e.g. see [24]). In either case vaccine acceptabil ity is the dependent va riable and respondent characteristics and hypothetical vaccine attributes may be used as explanatory variables (e.g. see [20]). Newman and Logie [7] conducted a sy stematic review and meta-analysis of HIV vaccine acceptability studies of these and other types, and found that the acceptability of a hypothetical vaccine varied between 37.2 and 94.0 on a 100-point linearised scale, with a weighted mean of 65.6, and that vaccine a cceptability was substantially higher for high efficacy versus moderate efficacy vaccines. They also found that effect sizes were largest (and significant) for efficacy, non 'risk group' membership, pragmatic obstacles (e.g. transportation and access to health facilities), and vaccine cost. The key problem with the linearised or dichotimised vaccine acceptability approach described above is that convent ional choice-based conjoint va lue analysis, as conducted in these studies, does not have a natural mapping in to ordinal utility theory and hence into measures of economic welfare change. The analysis implicitly uses vaccine acceptability as an indicator of cardinal utility, which is no t necessarily how the respondent interprets acceptability in their decision making process. Fu rthermore, because in most studies vaccine cost, if included, is effects co ded, the opportunity for a more de tailed consideration of the marginal willingness-to-pay of different vaccine attributes is lost. This is in spite of the recognition of the advantage of including cost in order to represent preference between attributes in monetary terms [25]. An arguably more appealing approach to a ssessing end user prefer ences is provided by interpreting observed choi ces by means of utility-theoreti c frameworks [26-27]. For example, using a random utility model appr oach, the marginal effects on utility levels of changes in attributes (e.g., efficacy, duration of effect) of hypothetical vaccines can be identified and estimated. This enables researcher to evaluate the acceptability of different vaccine profiles (or combinations of vaccine attributes) in th e target population. When one of the attributes evaluated is the cost of the hypothetical vaccine then the trad e-off between other attributes and cost can be evaluated in terms of probabil ity of acceptance at any given cost within the range explored [28]. In other words, co mmonly accepted economic estimates of welfare change (consumer surplus and marginal willingness to pay) for separate vaccine attributes can be identified and estimated from the ranki ng data when handled as discrete choices between mutually exclusive competing alternativ es [29]. A full ranking of seven alternatives can, for example, be interpreted as a sequence of six discrete choices [30]. The first ranked alternative is chosen from seven, the second ra nked from six, and so on until the alternative ranked second to the last is selected from tw o remaining attributes. There exists a vast literature on choice modelling based on random utility theory that can be used to analyse ranking data of this sort [30,31]. The categ ory of models of reference includes the multinomial logit and probit models [32,33] and its very numerous extensions [34]. Among 5 the major advantages of applying the random utility approach to choice-based conjoint analysis is its efficiency and precision. In this paper, we adopt the random utility ap proach to derive estim ates of the marginal willingness-to-pay for different attributes of a hypothetical HIV vaccine among men who have sex with men (MSM), male sex workers, and transgender women in Thailand. 2. Methods Based on preliminary qualitative data collection and previous studies of vaccine acceptability, eight hypothetical HIV vaccine scenarios were constructed. Each scenario featured a bundle of seven dichotomous vaccine attributes: (1) 99% versus 50% efficacy; (2) no versus minor side effects (specifically tem porary body aches, skin rash and fe vers); (3) 10-year versus one- year duration of protection; (4) vaccine-induc ed seropositivity (VISP) (wherein vaccinated individuals would subsequently test antibody po sitive for HIV) or not; (5) administered at private versus public hospitals; (6) high versus low social saturation (the proportion of the population already vaccinated); and (7) vaccine cost of THB100 versus THB2500 (about US$3 versus US$75). Eight scenarios with seven attributes (including co st) were chosen in order to keep the cognitive task manageable for respondents. Formative qualitative research was used to decide on the final attributes a nd levels for inclusion. A fractional factorial orthogonal design allowing only for main effects was used to de velop the eight scenarios, based on a Plackett-Burman design [35]. We note that out-of-pocket costs for medical procedures, including vaccines, are not unusu al in Thailand - thus the problem of respondents' misinterpretation of the cost variable [36,37] is le ss likely to ar ise, since the respondents should understand the true fina ncial consequence of their choices. Respondents (aged 18 years or over) were se lected using purposive, venue-based sampling [38] across two strata in Bangkok and Chiang Mai cities. The first stratum included gay entertainment venues such as gay strip clubs , movie theatres, massage parlours, and sex motels. The second stratum included commun ity-based organisations providing HIV prevention services to high-risk groups such as MSM, male sex workers, and transgender women. Data were collected from 326 responde nts between March 2008 and February 2009 using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing [39]. The median age of respondents was 27 years; 67.2% were male, 20.2% female, and 12.6% and 32.2% hete rosexual. The median monthly income of respondents was THB11,197 (US$345). Further details on data collecti on are available in Newman et al. [40]. The research was approve d by the institutional review boards of UCLA and the University of Toronto, and writte n informed consent was obtained from all respondents. Each respondent was first presented with ei ght laminated cards, one with each vaccine scenario, and asked to rank the ei ght scenarios, from the 'best' v accine to the 'worst' vaccine. 6 The respondents did this by first selecting the vaccine scenario they thought represented the 'best' vaccine, then selecting the vaccine scenario they though represented the 'worst' vaccine. Finally, they were asked to arrange the remaining six scenarios in order between their chosen best and worst scenarios. This pr ocedure leads to a complete rank ordering of the scenarios, as well as a definite procedure by whic h the respondents arrive at their ranking that can be exploited in the analysis. There was no opt-out option, i.e. respondents were forced to choose their ranking with no alternative option which is not to be vaccinat ed at all (a 'forced choice' experiment). Our result s therefore reflect the probabili ty of a respondent choosing a vaccine scenario in a forced choice rather th an the probability of that scenario being acceptable to the respondent. Given that one of the attributes in the conjoint scenarios is cost (price) of the vaccine, we can use this to eval uate the trade-off between other attributes and cost in terms of probability of acceptance at any given cost. Furthermore, because this procedure is a forced choice, methods of estim ating monetary valuations remain valid, as noted by Ryan [41]. Rank ordered choice data lend themselves to va rious alternative specifications. In the first specification, the data were fitted to a mu ltinomial logit likelihood function using only the best and worst choices of each respondent [42]. In this specification, the 'best' alternative is chosen from all eight scenarios, but the 'w orst' alternative is chosen from the seven remaining alternatives (i.e. excluding the 'best '). The literature prop osing this approach argues that focus on extremes of preference rank ings is cognitively less difficult or costly for the respondent and hence the utility functions are less affected by error variance. In the second specification, the data were fitted to a logit likelihood function using the full ranking data provided by the respondents using the rank -exploded logit model [30]. In this second specification, the ranking is interpreted as a se quence of seven discrete choices - the 'best' ranked alternative is chosen from all eight scenar ios, the 'worst' is chosen from the remaining seven, the 'second best' is chosen from the remaining six, and so on until the 'fourth best' scenario is selected from two remaining scenarios. This specification follows the procedure that respondents were asked to fo llow, in first determin ing the best, then th e worst alternative, before ranking the remaining six scenarios. We assume that respondents follow the same procedure (best, worst) throughout . Recent research in alternative utility coding for full-rank choice sets suggests that repeated best is cons istent with what a larg e fraction of respondents appear to be naturally do ing in their selection. It also suggest s that other ways to code utilities (e.g. repeated worst) produce mostly insignificant differences in estimated value for the utility coefficients [43,44]. In both specifications only vaccine attributes , inclusive of cost, were used as attributes of the systematic comp onent of the utility func tion. All attri bute levels were dummy-coded with the exception of cost. Finally, we were able to evaluate the trade- off between other attributes and cost in terms of probability of acceptance at any given cost. The marginal willingness-to-pay for each vaccine attribute was estimated by taking th e ratio of the estimated coefficient on each vaccine attribute to the estimated coefficient on cost. From these marginal willingness-to-pay 7 estimates, a mean willingness to pay and associated confidence interval can be estimated for any combination of vaccine attributes. Two respondents recorded invalid rankings, reducing the final sample size to 324. The marginal effects on utility of the vaccine attributes were es timated using maximum likelihood estimation routines coded in Gauss matr ix programming language (Aptech Systems). Marginal effects were converted to odds ratios to aid interpretation. 3. Results The results from the best-worst specification, in terms of estimated impact on vaccine choice, are presented in Table 1. Efficacy is the vaccine attribute with the great est marginal effect on choice - on average respondents are more than three times as likely to choose (odds ratio 3.432) a vaccine with 99% efficacy, than a vacci ne with 50% efficacy. Absence of moderate side effects more than doubles the probability of choice, while probability of choice is almost doubled by the absence of VISP. Duration and so cial saturation both significantly increase the probability of choice, but venue for vacc ination is statistically insignificant. Table 1: Factors affecting probability of vaccine choice - best-worst specification Attribute Odds Ratio Estimate Std. Error 1% level; ** significant at the 5% level; * significant at the 10% level. The results from the full rank specification are similar, as shown in Table 2. Efficacy has the greatest marginal effect on choice , but in this specif ication VISP is the second most important attribute. Social saturation and venue for vaccina tion have small, but statistically significant (although only at the 10% level for venue), effects on vaccine choice. Table 2: Factors affecting probability of vaccine choice - full rank specification Attribute Odds Ratio Estimate Std. Error P-value 1% level; ** significant at the 5% level; * significant at the 10% level. 8 The results from both specifi cations, when converted to ma rginal willingne ss-to-pay, are shown in Table 3, along with the 95% confidence interval for th e estimates (derived using the Krinsky-Robb procedure [45], with 10,000 replicat ions). These results are similar to those reported in the earlier two tables. Efficacy has th e greatest contribution to willingness-to-pay, with respondents on average willing to pay US $244 more for a high (99%) efficacy than low (50%) efficacy vaccine in the best-worst spec ification, and willing to pay US$383 more for a high efficacy vaccine in the full rank specifica tion. This willingness-to-pay for high efficacy is particularly high, given th at the mean monthly income of the sample was US$375 per month. The average willingness-to-pay for an HIV vacci ne with any combinati on of attributes can also be derived from Table 3. For instance, th e willingness-to-pay for the most advantageous (in the eyes of respondents on average) HIV vaccine (i.e. a vaccine with 99% efficacy, no side effects, no VISP, a 10-year duration, where the majority ha ve also been vaccinated, and delivered at a private hospital) is US$1100.50 (with a 95% confidence interval of between US$684.82 and US$2544.18). The willingness-to-pay for a lower cost or less optimal vaccine which might correspond more closely to early vaccine rollout (e.g. 50% efficacy, minor side effects, no VISP, 10-year duration, where th e majority have not been vaccinated, and delivered at a private hospital) is US$461.09 (w ith a 95% confidence in terval of between US$281.78 and US$1103.67). Table 3: Marginal (-6.17-117.95) In general, we found that the biomedical attr ibutes of a hypothetical HIV vaccine (efficacy, absence of VISP, absence of side effects, a nd duration of effect) were the most important attributes to respondents, in the sense that thes e were the vaccine attributes that they were willing to pay the most for. Other attributes (social saturation, venue for vaccination) were valued less by respondents. These results are impor tant for consideration prior to the rollout 9 of any future HIV vaccine. A vaccine with low efficacy, and/or which results in vaccine- induced seropositivity or moderate side effect s, would have significantly lower acceptability among high-risk groups, and lead to lower upt ake and reduced impact on HIV transmission within the group. However, the vaccine attributes investigated here were necessarily coarse, especially efficacy (99% versus 50%). While we can say that respondents were willing to pay significantly more for 99% efficacy as opposed to 50%, we cannot say whether, for instance, a reduction to 80% efficacy would significantly affect the acceptability of a future HIV vaccine. Future studies should l ook at more fine-grained efficacy and duration of protection attributes, in order to determine whether small changes in these attributes are important to potential vaccine recipients, part icularly as it is unlikely th at a vaccine with efficacy of anywhere close to 99% will become available for some time. The signs on the coefficients for so cial saturation are interesting, although a priori we had no strong expectation for a given sign on the co efficient. The signs on the social saturation coefficients imply that respondents are willi ng to pay more for (and hence more willing to accept) a vaccine where a majority of the po pulation has already been vaccinated. This contrasts with Heal and Kunreuther [46], who showed that the incentives to be vaccinated reduce as more of the population become vacci nated, because the pr ivate benefits of individual vaccination reduce. Th is 'free-riding' explanation doe s not appear to hold in our data. This may be because this study is base d on stated preference data and not actual vaccination behavior. Alternatively, it may be th at people are more likely to get vaccinated because of the perceived benefits to others (a ltruism), or because the number of people who have already decided to become vaccinated pr ovides a signal that the decision to become vaccinated is a good decision ('bandwagoning') [ 47]. While altruism is consistent with Theravada Buddhism, the predom inant religion in Thailand, we have no way of directly testing whether it is altruism or bandwagoning that is drivi ng the coefficient on social saturation in this data. However, this result is clearly important because social saturation has a small but significant effect on vaccine acceptabili ty. Future studies should consider in more detail whether and through which mechanism or mechanisms social saturation impacts on vaccine acceptability. For exampl e, socio-cultural factors such as communitarian norms or stigma [40,48] should be investigated. If this result proves to be a general result, then it would provide a justification for broad gove rnment-subsidized vaccination when a safe, efficacious vaccine becomes available. In low- and middle-income countries, it is part icularly important to c onsider the impact of cost; an increase from $3 to $75 resulted in nearly 50% lower odds of vaccine acceptability among men and transgender women in Thailand at high risk of HIV exposure. From the perspective of lifetime costs of HIV treatm ent, estimated at $500,000 [49,50], this suggests that government and privately funded subsidies could have a substantial and cost-effective impact on the epidemic by increasing vaccine uptake . In this context, an actual vaccine priced at the estimated willingness-to-pay for the hypothet ically best vaccine, absent cost subsidies, might result in low uptake among high-risk communities, thereby substantially reducing the 10 effectiveness of the vaccine on a population level. This paper used only two levels of the cost attribute, which were spaced far apart in term s of affordability for respondents. Future studies could improve the external validity of results by including more le vels of the cost attribute. Our analysis using random utility models clearl y shows that efficacy is the most important vaccine attribute, both in terms of the probability of vaccine acceptability and in terms of marginal willingness-to-pay. This result is diffe rent from those obtained with the same data using conjoint value analysis based on lineari sed acceptability with ordinary least squares regression (see [40]), where VISP was found to be the most important attribute, followed by efficacy and side effects. The results from our paper (primacy of efficacy) resonate with results from previous studies from North Am erica (e.g. see [11]). While VISP was also found to be an important vaccine attribute in the present analysis, the difference between the two analyses demonstrates a potential for bias when less information about ranking of attributes is used and different assumptions ar e invoked in the analys is of data. On a s ubstantive level, the importance of VISP might be mitigated with broad educational campaigns delivered in tandem with future vaccines, and may abate once an HIV vaccine achieves broad coverage (such that many of one's peers also test posi tive due to the vaccine) along with easy access to tests that detect the difference betwee n VISP and actual HIV infection [40]. The discovery of a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine will be a momentous event for global public health. Further evidence that supports bridging the gap between vaccine availability and public utilization [51], such as that reported here, is crucia l to the success of future HIV vaccines in reversing the epidemic.
