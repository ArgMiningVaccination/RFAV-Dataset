It also covers what research has found and when to check with a healthcare provider. Natural Treatment for Lupus Symptoms Some natural lupus treatments have been researched, but evidence should be considered preliminary at best. However, some people find complementary therapies beneficial for controlling symptoms, which may include: Fatigue Skin lesions and/or a butterfly-shaped rash on the face Weight gain or loss Joint pain and swelling Hair loss Mouth sores Chest pain Depression and/or anxiety Memory loss Be sure you talk to your healthcare provider about any natural remedies you'd like to try. Some may not be safe for you or may interfere with the medications you take. Remember that even natural treatments can cause side effects. Signs and Symptoms of Lupus Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids can curb inflammation. In addition, several studies have also found that they improve lupus symptoms. You can increase your omega-3 intake by: Eating oily fish such as salmon and sardinesAdding flaxseeds to foods, such as cereals, yogurts, salads, or soupsTaking a daily omega-3 supplement Omega-3 fatty acids have the added benefit of improving heart health. Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Arthritis Symptoms Herbal Medicine Small but growing lines of research have found that some medicinal herbs may help curb inflammation and the lupus symptoms that come with it. Anti-inflammatory herbs include: Ginger Turmeric/curcumin Green tea You can add these herbs to food or tea/herbal infusions, or you can take them in supplement form. Steroids and Vitamin D Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatories often used to treat lupus. They can thin your bones and raise your osteoporosis risk. Daily vitamin D and calcium supplements may help prevent this. Ask your healthcare provider whether these supplements are right for you. DHEA Research suggests that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplements may enhance quality-of-life for people with lupus. DHEA is a steroid hormone your body needs for making estrogen and testosterone. While DHEA shows promise as a complementary treatment for lupus, regular use of DHEA supplements could raise your risk of heart attack and some types of cancer. It's critical to only use DHEA under the supervision of a healthcare provider. What Is DHEA? Mind-Body Therapies According to early research, certain mind-body therapies may help you deal with the stress of lupus and lessen some symptoms. These therapies include: HypnotherapyGuided imageryMindfulness practicesElectro-acupuncture and standard acupunctureYoga To further alleviate stress, make sure to get plenty of sleep and exercise regularly. Ask a healthcare provider about the amount and types of exercise that are right for you. Using Natural Remedies Due to a lack of supporting research, it's too soon to recommend alternative medicine to treat lupus. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not test or regulate supplements. Therefore, the content of some products may differ from what is specified on the product label. Also, keep in mind that the safety of supplements has not been established in higher-risk populations, including: People who are pregnant or breastfeedingChildrenPeople with medical conditions or who take medications If you're considering alternative medicine, talk with a healthcare provider first. Self-treating a condition in lieu of standard care may have serious consequences. Summary Lupus is an autoimmune condition with many possible symptoms. In addition to standard medical care, some people use natural remedies, including supplements, herbs, and mind-body therapies. It's essential to work with a healthcare provider before incorporating alternative or complementary remedies into your treatment plan. 11 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
