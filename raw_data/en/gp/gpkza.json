Those points connect to the inner organs and the central nervous system and stimulate healing and balance. Acupuncture can help treat a wide variety of problems, ranging from arthritic pain and ligament injury to allergies and ear infections to chronic kidney disease and even seizures. Acupuncture can be a great benefit for pets with cancer, supporting their appetite and immune system, suppressing tumor growth, and relieving pain. Acupuncture also can be paired with conventional treatments to reduce the side effects of medications, improve comfort, and lessen symptoms.
