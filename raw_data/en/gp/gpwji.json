A Complete Guide To Crystal Healing Stones are minerals that are created as a result of natural geological processes. The minerals in the interiors of the earth acquire new physical and chemical properties due to the high temperature and pressure. A lot is [known about](https://nacrystal.com/) crystalline stones and their healing power, but much of it remains an enigma. Here are some quirky facts about crystals and their healing properties. The Origins Most people believe that crystal healing originated in the cultures of the East. Many accredit that the people in the Mesopotamian civilization used the healing power of stones and minerals to cure many ailments. Likewise, [traditional Chinese medicine](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-what-you-need-to-know) also makes use of minerals and stones to cure diseases. In India, the believers of crystal-based therapy believe that the stone interacts with the chakras of the patient and, in turn, heals them. It Is All About Good And Bad Energy People who believe in the power of stones attribute their medical properties to energies (both positive and negative). Crystals are said to attract positive or good energy and repel negative or bad energies. The exact way a piece of stone might attract or repel energies is unknown. However, many practitioners believe that the vibrational energy of a particular stone has a role to play. Crystals are made up of minerals that are, in turn, made up of atoms. The atoms within the crystals vibrate, and this vibration is said to synchronize with the vibration within human bodies. Some Claim The Healing Effect Is A Result Of A Placebo Many traditional medicine practitioners attribute the healing properties of stones to a [placebo effect](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect). Placebo, in simple terms, means a treatment that just makes one feel good without having any practical therapeutic value. The claim about the placebo effect has been solidified by a study that was conducted in France. In France, a group of people were asked to meditate for some time while holding a crystal in their hands. Most of them claimed that they felt better after meditating and holding the stone. However, only some people were given real crystals, while others were given fake stones. Since almost all participants reported feeling better after the crystal therapy, the healing effect has been attributed to a placebo. Contradictory And Complementary To Traditional Medicine Many doctors do not acknowledge the utility of crystals and outright reject their therapeutic values. However, some people believe that crystals have a calming effect and can be used by people undergoing long-term therapy like cancer therapy. Many doctors also suggest that the healing effect of the stones may be related to the mineral that they contain. For instance, Amber is a stone rich in succinic acid. Many people associate amber with pain-relieving properties. However, most traditional doctors believe that the pain-alleviating effect of amber is primarily because of succinic acid and has got nothing to do with the synchronization of energies.
