In many cultures throughout the world, Shamanic and Energy-based healing has been used for thousands of years, predating modern Western Medicine. As each person is a unique expression of energy, the work is unique to that person. Each person requires different practices and techniques. In session, we will conduct a detailed assessment of your conditions and create a tailored plan specific to you. Your sessions may be an integrative fusion of many different modalities, likely to include many forms of Energy Medicine and Shamanic Healing Practices, and will complement any other treatments you may be receiving through Conventional Medicine. Holistic Medicine by definition is \"all modalities'' which complement and honor individual needs. Email christina@theeastinstitute.com to request a consultation. When a person is dealing with a physical, psycho-emotional, or psycho-spiritual condition, we see symptoms which are reflective of a systemic and energetic imbalance. Energy may be moving too quickly or not quickly enough. It may be distorted or stagnant, or there may be fundamental misalignments. This can affect the tissues, organs, and overall health and wellbeing. These imbalances are stressors to the body. These symptoms may manifest in many ways, such as inflammation-based conditions like neuromuscular pain and discomfort, organ malfunction, and/or chronic inflammation-based diseases like Cancer. Western Medicine treats the physical body to relieve symptoms. Within Energy Medicine and Shamanic Healing, we treat the whole person and the causal energy which is creating the imbalance that creates the symptoms. We go to the core foundation and reestablish energetic balance by treating the root cause. The cause may be environmental, psycho-emotional, trauma-based, soul-based, or ancestral in nature. Once these energies are released, the symptoms subside, and the systems come back into a state of balance. This is the fundamental difference between treatment and healing "}
