To assist you as you evaluate options for you and your family, this notice provides some basic information about the Marketplace and employment-based health coverage offered by your employer. What is theHealth Insurance Marketplace? The Marketplace is designed to help you find health insurance that meets your needs and fits your budget. The Marketplace offers \"one-stop shopping\" to find and compare private health insurance options. You may also be eligible for a tax credit that lowers your monthly premium right away. Open enrollment for health insurance coverage through the Marketplace begins each year in November for coverage starting as early as the following January 1. Can ISave Money onmyHealth Insurance Premiums intheMarketplace? You may qualify to save money and lower your monthly premium, but only if your employer does not offer coverage, or offers coverage that doesn't meet certain standards. The savings on your premium that you're eligible for depends on your household income. Does Employer Health Coverage Affect Eligibility for Premium Savings through the Marketplace? Yes. If you have an offer of health coverage from your employer that meets certain standards, you will not be eligible for a tax credit through the Marketplace and may wish to enroll in your employer's health plan. However, you may be eligible for a tax credit that lowers your monthly premium, or a reduction in certain cost-sharing if your employer does not offer coverage to you at all or does not offer coverage that meets certain standards. If the cost of a plan from your employer that would cover you (and not any other members of your family) is more than 9.59% of your household income for the year, or if the coverage your employer provides does not meet the \"minimum value\" standard set by the Affordable Care Act, you may be eligible for a tax credit.1 Note: If you purchase a health plan through the Marketplace instead of accepting health coverage offered by your employer, then you may lose the employer contribution (if any) to the employer-offered coverage. Also, this employer contribution - as well as your employee contribution to employer-offered coverage - is often excluded from income for Federal and State income tax purposes. Your payments for coverage through the Marketplace are made on an after-tax basis. How Can I Get More Information? For more information about your coverage offered by your employer, please check your summary plan description or contact the HR Service Center at 402-552-6947 or myhr@nebraskamed.com. The Marketplace can help you evaluate your coverage options, including your eligibility for coverage through the Marketplace and its cost. Please visit HealthCare.gov for more information, including an online application for health insurance coverage and contact information for a Health Insurance Marketplace in your area. 1 An employer-sponsored health plan meets the \"minimum value standard\" if the plan's share of the total allowed benefit costs covered by the plan is no less than 60 percent of such costs . 13 NEW COLLEAGUE ORIENTATIONPART B: Information About Health Coverage Offered by Your Employer This section contains information about any health coverage offered by your employer. If you decide to complete an application for coverage in the Marketplace, you will be asked to provide this information. This information is numbered to correspond to the Marketplace application. 3.

Email address myhr@nebraskamed.com Here is some basic information about health coverage offered by this employer: As your employer, we offer a health plan to: All employees.

With respect to dependents: we do offer coverage. Eligible dependents are: Eligible dependents are: 1. A covered employee 's legal spouse; 2. A covered employee 's child(ren) up to the limiting age of 26: natural child, stepchild, adopted child, child, child placed with the employee for adoption, child for whom the employee has legal custody, or child for whom the employee has court- ordered custody. 3. A covered employee 's dependent child who reaches the limiting age of 26 and is totally disabled, incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental or physical handicap, primarily dependent upon the covered employee for support and maintenance and unmarried. We do not offer coverage. If checked, this coverage meets the minimum value standard, and the cost of this coverage to you is intended to be affordable, based on employee wages. ** Even if your employer intends your coverage to be affordable, you may still be eligible for a premium discount through the Marketplace. The Marketplace will use your household income, along with other factors, to determine whether you may be eligible for a premium discount. If, for example, your wages vary f rom week to week (perhaps you are an hourly employee or you work on a commission basis), if you are newly employed mid- year, or if you have other income losses, you may still qualify for a premium discount. If you decide to shop for coverage in the Marketplace, HealthCare.gov will guide you through the proce ss. 14 NEW COLLEAGUE ORIENTATIONCONCOURSE LEVEL 15 NEW COLLEAGUE ORIENTATION 16 NEW COLLEAGUE ORIENTATION 16 N E SWEMILE STREETEMILE STREET 42ndSTREET 41st 38thAVENUE 38th STREET44th 42ndSTREETSADDLE CREEK ROAD46th ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION 13ST (UNDER) 17Emergency Blue Light Phones can be used to report Emergencies and to contact Security.
