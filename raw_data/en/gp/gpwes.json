This four-year longitudinal medical student program is dedicated to supporting the practice of evidence-based, compassionate, whole-person care to benefit the treatment of patients and families, our community and healthcare as a whole. HEAL-IM incorporates a diverse set of teaching methods and resources, including: HEAL-IM medical students may also choose additional elective time completing certified integrative medicine training (in acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation therapy, medical hypnosis and culinary medicine) supporting the effective implementation of future integrative medicine practices. HEAL-IM is designed to focus specifically on advancing integrative medicine research, education and clinical practice to promote individual and population wellness. We are driven by a mission to provide a sound foundation in the principles, philosophy and evidence-based practices of integrative medicine, setting the stage for future professional study and practice. By the end of the program, students will be able to: UCI Medical Students are uniquely positioned to collaborate with practitioners, researchers and educators of the [Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute](https://ssihi.uci.edu/about-us/). Integrative medicine can be defined as a healing-oriented practice of medicine that: Underlying the spirit of integrative medicine is the commitment to involve the patient as an active partner in his or her care, with a focus on teaching self-care and self-management tools, as well as supporting healthy lifestyle behaviors that are the basis for optimal health and wellness. Integrative medicine also highlights the need for health equity and for ensuring access to much-needed prevention and wellness resources in underserved communities. Fundamentally, integrative medicine recognizes that health systems need to move beyond just the diagnosis and treatment of disease complications (pathogenesis) to fully embrace health creation, or salutogenesis. We believe the combination of evidence-based integrative care, together with advanced conventional treatment options, form the basis for providing our patients with the most effective, compassionate, whole person medical care for the 21st century. The practice of integrative medicine includes the following elements: New HEAL-IM students will meet with the program's faculty and leadership at the start of the school year to review expectations and aspects of curricular elements. First- and second-year students will participate in a monthly seminar series that will include presentations by a rotating panel of UCI and integrative medicine community specialists on topics covering a range of integrative medicine practices and skills. During the second, third and fourth years of the HEAL-IM curriculum, students will participate in a quarterly multidisciplinary patient-care conference. This will include patient case presentations by faculty in family medicine, osteopathy, nursing, naturopathy, as well as practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, chiropractic and Ayurvedic medicine. Throughout the four years of the program, HEAL-IM students also will complete a variety of online evidence-based education modules through the University of Arizona covering a broad span and scope of integrative medicine. Module topics during the first year will include wellness, resiliency, nutrition, mind-body and exercise.> Module topics for year two will cover integrative medicine modalities and motivational interviewing. Various clinical topics will be covered in years three and four. The PACE program is a longitudinal clinical rotation for all UCI first and second-year medical students, designed to introduce clinical knowledge and skills to students and to integrate basic science training into the clinical setting. Though not guaranteed, HEAL-IM students may have the opportunity to be matched with integrative medicine clinic practices at UCI Medical Center, the Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute, and in other offsite clinical locations in the community. Students in the HEAL-IM program are expected to participate in a fourth-year integrative medicine elective experience. This will include clinical rotations at integrative medicine clinical sites; completion of additional University of Arizona integrative medicine modules; attendance at a tai chi research lab; a yoga therapy clinic, and completion of a three-to-five page reflection paper. (View links below for information about additional-curricular elements, opportunities for the MS1 summer and optional integrative medicine skills training.) Throughout their medical school education, HEAL-IM students will be trained and mentored by physicians and providers with expertise in integrative medicine. Additional HEAL-IM Curricular Elements HEAL-IM students also have the opportunity to participate in: To be considered for the HEAL-IM program, applicants first must be accepted to [UCI School of Medicine](http://www.som.uci.edu). Upon acceptance to the medical school, information about the program is sent to all students. During orientation in early August, all students receive information about the HEAL-IM application process and are invited to attend an Information Session about the program. Students attending the information session will be given the link for the online program application. Applications will be reviewed by the HEAL-IM interview committee and students selected for an interview will be contacted. The program is committed to offering a partial scholarship of $7,000 towards tuition and fees for the senior year for students in good standing in the program, as well as up to $6,000 towards either an Integrative certificate program (Acupuncture, Culinary Medicine, Hypnosis, Biofeedback, OMT). The program will also cover the tuition and lodging fees for the summer LEAPS into IM program, as well as attendance at the Scripps Evidence-Based Natural Supplements conference in San Diego during MS2 and MS4 years.
