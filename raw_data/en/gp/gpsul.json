She had been sharing how she treated the symptoms on her website, The Purist, and Instagram along the way. But it was the post about the third week of treatments that inspired a rash of rage-posting. Most of the remedies she shared, Clorox aside, would not be terribly affordable to the majority of sufferers of COVID-19. There were mentions of a \"Body Charger\" that she borrowed from a friend on the advice of an energy specialist who has made cancer-treating claims, and a home visit from a doctor brandishing a vitamin I.V. drip. The most attention, though, went to the Clorox bath, which she defended when she amended the post on The Purist. (She added to the post and bolded, \"None of these natural remedies below should be taken without consulting a doctor or naturopath.\") \"Who knows if it worked or what it did, but I know that in nine days, I got most of that virus out of my system,\" she said. \"This being a virus with no vaccination and no cure, my resolution was to learn as much as I can, go to my same doctor, Linda Lancaster, and follow her protocol, her prescription. And no way am I saying please try this. It's just the path that I took, and I'm sharing it because there isn't a lot of anecdotal evidence.\" Cristina's homeopathic doctor, Dr. Lancaster, also provided a statement to Vanity Fair to defend the treatments, including a book plug and some testimonials from a dentist, another doctor, and a patient. It mostly addressed the Clorox bath blowback. \"Most recently, there has been concern over the use of Clorox baths in an overall health program offered during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" she wrote. \"Therapeutic baths are most useful when used in conjunction with herbs, homeopathic remedies, and a healthy diet. In my book, Harmonic Healing, the benefits of bath protocols are clearly explained. I have been recommending baths as part of a health program to my patients with positive results for almost 40 years. With regard to the safety of using the Clorox bath on the skin, many medical doctors recommend this even to children. As I have always maintained and written, these baths are just one part of a comprehensive program to build the immune system and help the body detoxify. I've included links of M.D.s discussing the benefits of adding a small amount of Clorox to a bath from the Mayo Clinic, the University of Michigan, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.\" In her conversation with People, Cristina got at the essential appeal of homeopathic medicine. When the medical establishment doesn't have a ton of answers, more experimental options can be more persuasive. \"I have to say, the fear I had going into it was far greater than the fear I had while I was in it,\" she said. \"I think there's so much anxiety right now around this virus, and part of it is the fear of knowing there's no vaccine, and there's no proven cure or treatments.\" \u2014 Cover Story: Princess Anne Opens Up About Her [Lifetime as a Royal](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/princess-anne-opens-up-about-her-lifetime-as-a-royal?itm_content=footer-recirc) \u2014 How Donald Trump Almost [Killed My Husband](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/how-donald-trump-almost-killed-my-husband?itm_content=footer-recirc) \u2014 Silence in the Streets: Dispatches From [New York City Under Lockdown](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/silence-in-the-streets-dispatches-from-new-york-city-under-lockdown?itm_content=footer-recirc) \u2014 [Jimmy Rackover Murder Saga:](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/murder-at-sutton-place?itm_content=footer-recirc) The True Story of Joey Comunale's Death \u2014 Keith McNally Survived Coronavirus and [Has No Idea What New York Nightlife Will Look Like After This](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/keith-mcnally-has-no-idea-what-new-york-nightlife-will-look-like-after-this?itm_content=footer-recirc) \u2014 What to Expect When [Meghan Markle's Tabloid Trial](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/meghan-markle-tabloid-trial-preliminary-hearings?itm_content=footer-recirc) Begins \u2014 From the Archive: The Green Revolution As Forged by [Fashion, Venture Capitalists, Rockers, and Hoteliers](https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2007/5/global-citizans?itm_content=footer-recirc) Looking for more?
