That is a common myth that can lead to the flu spreading, says a nursing researcher. \"By containing an inactive virus, the flu vaccine gives your body a sneak peek, so if you are exposed to the flu virus after vaccination your immune system will be able to fight it off much easier,\" says [Libby Richards](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/nur/directory/faculty/richards_libby.html), an associate professor of nursing who specializes in public health in Purdue University's [School of Nursing](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/nur/index.html). \"People may feel under the weather after receiving the flu shot due to signs of the body creating an immune response, which is actually a good thing,\" Richards says. \"Common side effects from flu shots are muscle soreness at the injection site. Some people may also develop a low-grade fever, headache or overall muscle aches. These side effects can be mistaken for the flu, but in reality, are just a body's normal response to vaccination.\" Traditional flu vaccines protect against three flu viruses: influenza A (H1N1) virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and an influenza B virus. There are also flu vaccines that protect against four flu viruses, frequently called \"quadrivalent\" vaccines. These vaccines protect against the same viruses as the trivalent vaccine and an additional B virus. Although U.S. flu activity is currently [low](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm), some areas are seeing flu activity. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm), people ages 6 and above should get their flu vaccination. Richards said it is common for most people to get a flu shot in October, but they can also do so later. Flu season typically peaks from December through February but can remain active well into May.
