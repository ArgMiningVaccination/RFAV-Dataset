S-CORPORATION An S- Corporation begins its existence as a general, for -profit Corporation upon filing the Articles of Incorporation at the state level. A general for -profit corporation (also known as a C- Corporation) is required to pay income tax on taxable income generated by the corporation. After the corporation has been formed, it may elect \"S -Corporation Status\" by submitting IRS form 2553 to the Internal Revenue Service (in some cases a state filing is required as well). Once this filing is complete, the corporation is taxed like a partnership or sole proprietorship rather than as a separate entity. Thus, the income is \"passed- through\" to the shareholders for purposes of computing tax liability. Therefore, a shareholder's individual tax return will report the income or loss generated by an S - Corporation. An S- Corporation can have a maximum of 75 shareholders, and the income and expenses would still be passed through to each individual and taxed on that level.

MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2012 CLIENT RIGHTS - CIVIL RIGHTS 0003.09.03 Treat clients fairly and with understanding. Inform people of their civil rights at application and recertification. All applicants for and participants of assistance are entitled to information about their civil rights. They are also entitl ed to inform ation about how to file a complaint if they believe they have been subjected to discriminatory treatment by a human services provider. The civil rights protections that clients have depend upon the applicable law or laws. For example, under state human rights law, you may not discriminate against applicants or participants of assistance on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, disability (including ensuring physical and program access for people with disabilities), sex, sexual orientation, or public assistance status. Under federal civil rights law, you may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, or disability. Unlike state law, federal law does not protect applicants or participants of public assistance from discrimination based on sexual orientation or on receipt of public assistance. In addition, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program has specific civil rights protections of its own. Under the federal SNAP program, you may not discriminate against an applicant or participant of SNAP on the basis of age, sex, color, race, disability, creed, national origin, or political beliefs. In January 2001, the Office of C ivil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Dept . of Health and Human Servic es issued a policy guidance prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities. This guidance focused on TANF programs and was based on Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 . The OCR guidance may be found at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/prohibition.html The concepts central to compliance are: Individualized treatment (disabled par ticipants should be treated on a case by case basis consistent with facts and objective evidence). AND Effective and meaningful opportunity (disabled participants must be afforded the opportunity to benefit from TANF programs that is as effective as the opportunity afforded to participants without disabilities). A participant with disabilities, for purposes of compliance with ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act, means a participant with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits 1 or more major life activity, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. This definition is different than that typically used to determine eligibility in programs that provide cash assistance based upon disability, such as SSI and SSDI. County and Employment Services staff are required to inform all participants of their right to equal access to all services and benefits regardless of a physical or mental disability. This means that Employment Plans for all caregivers with documented disabilities must take into consideration any/all limitations due to a disability. Many of these participants may meet qualifications for Family Stabilization Services (FSS) and would be required to develop an FSS Employment Plan. See Employment Services Manual 7.18.3 (FSS EP or EP for Participants with a Disability), 11.6 (FSS Eligibility Criteria). DHS has developed a brochure, \"Do you have a disability?\" ( DHS -4133) (PDF), which provides job seekers with information about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This form is for applicants and participants in any program. WHERE TO FILE CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINTS There are several agencies that people may contact to file a complaint if they believe they have been subjected to discrimination by a human services provider. Under certain circumstances a person may file the same complaint with more than 1 agency. Some agencies do not have authority to accept certain types of civil rights complaints. Always give clients enough information about filing complaints so they can decide for themselves which agency (or agencies) t o contact. After a client contacts an agency, that agency will inform the client about whether it is the appropriate agency to receive COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2012 CLIENT RIGHTS - CIVIL RIGHTS 0003.09.03 the complaint. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state human rights law. The agency will assist people with the complaint filing process. Clients may file a public services discrimination complaint by contacting that agency directly: Minnesota Department of Human Rights 190 E. Fifth Street St. Paul, MN 55101 (800) 657- 3704 (Voice) (651) 296-1 283 (TTY/TDD) People may also file a discrimination complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS).

Private data are accessible to the subject of the data or the subject's authorized representative. State law classifies some data collected and maintained by county agencies as confidential. Confidential data is not accessible to the subject of the data. County human service, corrections, public health, and veterans services agencies within a county may inform each other when a person or family is currently being served by the county unit, without the consent of the subject of the data. Beyond informing of involvement with these county units, data sharing is limited to name, telephone number, and last known address of the data subject, and the identification and contact information regarding personnel of the county unit responsible for working with the person or family. If additional information is needed, the county may share if the unit is authorized by state statute or federal l aw, or if the person gives written, informed consent. Refer to the Data Practices Manual issued by DHS for further information. This manual is not available in printed copy. Clients may review private records which contain information on them. Only the information classified as private or public i s available for review by the client. Private or public data must be actually shown to the subject of the data and not summarized. Honor requests for review as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days following the request. Do not count weekends and holidays in the 10- day period. When the county agency tells the client during the initial 10 days it needs more time, it may take up to an additional 10 days with a mutual agreement with the client. The county agency may set the place and time of review. Data on 2 or more people maintained in a common file because of family relationships are \"joint records\". Delete material in joint records about the person not requesting the review to protect that person's privacy. Parents may view records of their minor children, unless: There is a court order preventing acc ess to the data. OR The minor children request in writing that the agency deny parental access to the data, and the agency determines that accessing the data by the parent(s) is not in the best interest of the children. Provide copies of original documents when requested by the subject of the data or the subject's authorized representative. Provide 1 free copy of a document and additional copies at the cost of reproduction. MFIP, DWP: County agencies and Employment Services Providers (ESPs) are required to follow data privacy procedures. It is important that counties, tribes, and ESPs ensure confidentiality to victims of family violence. This is critical when the victim of family violence lives with the abuser. You should consult with your county attorney regarding your county's data practices policy if you are uncertain how to apply this policy. Obtain a release of information from the client prior to talking to a family violence advocate about the client's issues relating to family violence. Financial workers and job counselors must consult with the client to determine where mail should be sent or phone calls made. Do not assume that mail can be sent or phone calls can be made to the client's residence as often the abus er is still in the hom e or has access to the home. All requirements related to data privacy and confidentiality that apply to other MFIP cases also apply to MFIP cases that hav e been approved for a hardship extension. Clients have a legal right to review the data we collect and maintain on them. A stamp of \"confidential\" by the health care provider (authorized licensed medical or mental health professional) does not change tha t right, EXCEPT under rare circumstances when the health care provider specifically requests that the information be withheld from the client because it is determined that: Certain information contained i n the record may be detrimental to the physical or mental health of the client. OR Certain information is likely to cause the client to inflict s elf harm or harm to others.

MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2008 CLIENT RIGHTS - LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY 0003.09.12 People with limited English language proficiency (LEP) often face unique challenges due to their inability or limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English. Lack of English proficiency can limit people's access to public services programs t o which they may be eligible , such as financial, medical, educational, health, and social services. Federal and state civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of national origin, as it affects people with limited English language proficiency . All applicants for and participants of public assistance who have limited English language proficiency are entitled to FREE and TIMELY language assistance services. The burden of providing language assistance services must never be on the person with LEP. It is always on the agency or service provider. The agencies must ensure that all clients with LEP are given adequate information and are able to understand the services and available benefits, and receive the benefits for which they are eligible. Counties must also ensure that clients with LEP are able to communicate the relevant circumstances of their situation to the county. Each county is required to develop and implement an LEP plan. The LEP plan must include policies and procedures for provid ing language assistance, including a range of oral language assistance options, and in certain circumstances, translation of writ ten materials. The plan should also include procedures for providing notice to people with LEP of the rights to language assis tance FREE of charge and in a timely manner during all hours of the agency's operation. Agency staff should follow the provisions of their county LEP plan for dealing with clients with LEP. For more information about county LEP plans, contact the county LEP coordinator or county director. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2013 EMERGENCIES 0004 This chapter outlines programs available to help people in emergency situations.

When determining destitute status, consider the source of income for a migrant or seasonal farmworker unit to be the grower, rather than the crew leader . If a unit received SNAP in anot her state during the month of application, treat the next month as the month of application and the 1st day of the month as the application date when determining destitute status in the procedure below. Actual processing standards are still based on the actual date of application. See 0004.06 (Emergencies - 1st Month Processing) , 0005.12.15 (Application Processing Standards) . Migrant and seasonal farmworker units are destitute if they meet any of these conditions: The only income the unit received in the application month w as before the date of application and from a terminated source. - Consider income the unit gets monthly or more often to be from a terminated source if the unit will not get income again from that source during the application month or the next month. - Consider income the unit gets less often than monthly to be from a terminated source if the unit will not get any more income from that source in the month they would normally get the next pay ment. The only income the unit will get in the application month is from a new source. They will not get more than $25 from that source by the 10th calendar day after the date of application. - Consider income the unit gets monthly or more often to be from a new source if the unit has not received more than $25 from that source in the 30 days before the application date. - Consider income the unit gets less often than monthly to be from a new source if the unit has not received more than $25 from that source within the normal interval between payments. The unit will get income from a terminated source before the date of application and from a new source after the date of application. The unit cannot get any other income during the application month and cannot get more than $25 from the new source by the 10th calendar day after the date of application. Consider people who change jobs but stay with the same employer to be receiving income from the same source. Employers sometimes advance employees money to cover costs of moving to a new job. Do not consider travel advances when determining whether income is from a new source or whether the unit is destitute. When determining eligibility and benefit l evels, count as income travel advances that are advances on future wages as stated in a written contr act which was executed at or before the time the advance was given. Exclude as income travel advances that are reimbursements for actual travel costs. S ee 0017.15.75 (Reimbursement of Expenses) . Exclude as income any EA or EGA that is vendor paid for a migrant or seasonal farmworker unit while the unit is in the job stream when determining destitute status, eligibility, and benefit levels. See 0017.06 (Excluded Income) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 DESTITUTE UNITS, ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFITS 0004.51 MFIP: See 0004.06 (Emergencies - 1st Month Processing) to determine when units get expedited food portion or a SNAP case needs to be opened. If the unit can get expedited food portion and is destitute, see 0004.48 (Destitute Units - Migrant/Seasonal Farmworker) , follow the SNAP provisions below. DWP, MSA, GA, EGA, GRH: No provisions. SNAP: When determining eligibility and benefit levels for destitute units for the application month, consider only income received between the 1st of that month and the date of application.

At recertification, disregard income from a new source in the 1st month of the new certification period if the unit will not receive more than $25 from the new source by the 10th calendar day after the date of the unit's normal issuance cycle. When determining eligibility for a destitute unit, treat a unit which received SNAP in another state during the month of application the same as a unit being recertified. Begin counting the 10 days with the 1st day of the month after the month they applied in Minnesota.

If an applicant submits a Combined Application Form with no programs selected or submits an ApplyMN application with the program code UNKWN in the file name, pend the application on REPT/PND1 and schedule an interview. If the applicant fails to complete an interview or select any applicable program s during the interview, deny the application 30 days after the date of application. See 0026.15 (Notices of Denial, Termination, or Suspension) , TEMP Manual TE02.05.27 (Autodeny: REPT/PND1 and REPT/PND2). Encourage people to apply for assistance in their Minnesota county of residence. See 0011.09 (County Residence) . Accept applications from people even if they are not residents of your county. Forward applications to their county of residence the SAME DAY you receive them. If you must forward an application for a client with an emergency, you may need to take extra steps, such as calling the other county to schedule an appointment or assisting with transportation expenses to the other county. If a person has been on MAXIS before, request the case file from the former county. That county should purge the physical case record using current record retention policies and send the physical case file to the new county of residence no more than 5 working days after getting the request. See 0006.27 (County Financial Responsibility Disputes), 0008.06.21 (Change in County of Residence) .

The car egiver's option to request approval of an education and training plan according to the assessment requirements . The availability of work study programs under the higher education systems. Counties must work with clients to provide child care and transportation necessary to ensure a caregiver has every opportunit y to attend orientation. It is critical that participants leave the orientation knowing MFIP is a work -focused program and that they are prepared to enter the next phase of the Employment Services program. The county and the Employment Services Provider may design the details of the orientation to suit the needs of their local area and participants. The orientation is the participant's 1st exposure to MFIP Employment Services and should actively promote the value of early employment. See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) for information on sanctions for failure to attend orientation, and 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non- Compliance - MFIP/DWP) for information on good cause for failure to attend orientation. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 FAMILY VIOLENCE PROVISIONS/REFERRALS 0005.12.12.09 MFIP: Give applicants the Family Violence Referral (DHS-3323) (PDF) and Domestic Violence Information (DHS-3477) (PDF) . Provide this information at application, recertification and as part of the Employment Services (ES) overview. See 0005.12.12.01 (Forms/Handouts for Applicants) . When an applicant or participant asks about the Family Violence Waiver or reveals that he/she or a household member has been or is a victim of family violence, explain exemption from the 60-month time limit for victims of family violence under the Family Violence Waiver Option and give the client the Domestic Violence Information (DHS-3477) (PDF) . See 0011.30 (60-Month Lifetime Limit) . Explain the advantages to the client (exemption from the 60-month limit and ability to address safety issues), and provide the client with information about community resources that provide services to victims of family violence. Although you may believe it would be in the best interest of the client to choose a Family Violence Waiver, it is ALWAYS the client's choice whether to ask for it. Never question a client's self-identified need for a Family Violence Waiver. Explain to the participant the documentation required to substantiate a claim of family violence. See 0010.18.33 (Verifying Family Violence) . Follow regular verification time lines when requesting documentation. See 0010.21 (Verification Due Dates) . Do not delay processing an application while the client gets documentation of family violence or is developing an Employment Plan (EP). Do NOT impose an ES sanction/disqualification during the period of time that a participant is obtaining documentation. Also see 0010 (Verification) . When a client requests a Family Violence Waiver, refer the client to a domestic violence advocate or someone trained in domestic violence if the client is not already working with someone. See PERSON TRAINED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE in 0002.49 (Glossary: Permanent...) . Each county must identify locally-trained people in order to ensure access for all clients. Counties can contact the Minnesota Center for Crime Victim Services at 651- 282-6252 or 1-888- 622-8799 for information about agencies in their area. You can also refer the client to legal services at 1-888-354-5522. The client, the person trained in domestic violence, and the job counselor will jointly develop the Employment Plan (EP). Once a participant has requested and been approved for a Family Violence Waiver they meet qualifications for Family Stabilization Services (FSS). See Employment Services Manual 7.18.3 (FSS EP or EP for Participants with a Disability), 11.6 (FSS Eligibility Criteria). County agencies and ES providers are required to follow data privacy procedures. It is also important to ensure confidentiality to victims of family violence, especially when the victim lives with the abuser. Consult with your county attorney regarding the county's data practices policy if you are uncertain about how to apply this policy. Obtain a release of information from the participant prior to talking to a domestic violence advocate about the participant's issues related to family violence. Consult with the participant to determine where mail should be sent or phone calls made, since the abuser is often still in the home or has access to the home. During the application process, if you become aware of a non-citizen who is a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined victim of battery and/or cruelty that could also meet the family violence exemption provision, make the necessary referrals using the Family Violence Referral (DHS-3323) (PDF) . See 0011.03.21 (Non-Citizens - Victims of Battery/Cruelty) . A victim of family violence may be eligible for an extension of MFIP benefits after the person has verified he/she is a victim of family violence and has developed an Employment Plan (EP). See 0010.18.33 (Verifying Family Violence) , 0028.15 (Employment Plan (EP)) . DWP: Follow MFIP, EXCEPT the references to information required at recertification and exemption from the 60-month time limits do NOT apply to DWP. SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 APPLICATION PROCESSING STANDARDS 0005.12.15 All assistance programs require you to process applications as soon as possible, and within a certain number of days from the date of application. Day 1 of the count starts with the 1st day following the date of application. See 0005.12.09 (Date of Application) . See program provisions listed below for application processing timetables. Processing standards are the maximum time you have to determine eligibility. Do NOT treat this time as a waiting period for eligibility. Determine eligibility as soon as the necessary information is available. Send a notice approving, pending, or denying eligibility. See 0010 (Verification) , 0026 (Notices) . The processing standards for Emergency General Assistance, DWP and expedited SNAP applications differ from standard applications. See 0004.06 (Emergencies - 1st Month P rocessing) , 0005.12.09 (Date of Application) . Within the processing period: Review the application for completeness. Schedule and conduct the interview. See 0005.12.12 (Application Interviews) . Verify mandatory and inconsistent items. See 0010.1 8 (Mandatory Verifications) , 0010.21 (Verification Du e Dates) . Determine eligibility. Send a notice. See 0026 (Notices) . See 0005.12.15.03 (Delays in Processing Applications) for what to do when you cannot determine eligibility within the time frames listed below because clients do not provide information, for delays not caused by clients, and when not to delay processing. See 0022.03.03 (Ineligibility in a Prospective Month - Cash) , 0022.03.04 (Ineligibility in a Prospective Month - SNAP) for provisions relating to cases that are ineligible in a prospective month. MFIP: Determine eligibility no later than 30 days following the date of the application. Clients must be eligible for assistance on the date you approve the case. To meet the 30- day requirement, you may want to conduct interviews for minor caregivers on an accelerated schedule due to the time that social service evaluations might require. See 0004.01 (Emergencies - Program Provisions) , 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 20) . DWP: Below are various steps and time lines in processing a DWP application: Conduct the initial face to face interview to determine DWP eligibility within 5 working days of receiving the application. Although you must conduct an interview within 5 working days, the participant still has 30 days before the application expires. If an applicant does not show up for an appointment within the 5 days, attempt to reschedule the appointment. If more than 30 days have lapsed since the date of application, deny the application, giving proper notice. Determine the need for child care at the interview and complete a child care application before the interview ends. Forward the child care application to the child care worker the day that it is completed. Within 1 working day of determining tha t the applicant meets the DWP eligibility criteria, refer the participant to ES. Trigger the referral based on county policy. Some counties may choose to make the referral pending receipt of final verifications, other s may choose to wait until all verifications are in. Prompt referral to ES is critical because applicants cannot receive DWP benefits until eligibility is determined and an initial EP has been developed and signed. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 APPLICATION PROCESSING STANDARDS 0005.12.15 The participant's referral to ES must be in writing and must contain: - Notifi cation that, as part of the application process, applicants are required to develop and sign an Employment Plan or the DWP application will be denied. - The name and phone number of the ES provider. - The immediate availability of supportive services, including, but not limited to, child care, transportation, and other work - related aid. - The rights, responsibilities, and obligations of participants in the program, including, but not limited to, their rights und er the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the grounds for good cause, the consequences of refusing or failing to participate fully with program requirements, and the appeal process. Also see 0003.09.03 (Client Rights - Civil Rights) . The Job Counselor will meet with the DWP participant within 10 working days of the county referral to develop and sign an initial EP. The Job Counselor must notify the county within 1 working day of the date the EP was signed. Authorize DWP benefits through MAXIS to the participant within 1 working day of being notified by the ES provider that the initial EP has been developed and signed. Use the following forms: Diversionary Work Program Referral to Employment Services (DHS -4161) (PDF) . Client Responsib ilities and (PDF) . NOTE: There are no DWP orientation requirements. A county may opt to provide an orientation for its DWP participants.

MAXIS will not automatically deny applications pending past 30 days. You must deny the application at the appropriate time. SNAP: Determine eligibility and issue benefits or a denial notice no later than 30 days following the date of the application. If you cannot determine eligibility within 30 days, send a notice of processing delay, determine who caused the delay, and allow an additional 30 days to complete the application processing. See 0005.12.15.03 (Delays in Processing Applications) , 0005.12.15.06 (Determining Who Caused the Delay) , 0024 (Payments) . EXCEPTION If the unit failed to attend the initially scheduled interview, an attempt has been made to inform the unit of their responsi bility to schedule a second interview, and the client has made no subsequent contact with the agency to express interest in pursuing the application, deny the application on the 30th day. See TEMP Manual TE02.05.15 (Notice of Interview/Missed Interview (NOMI)). Also, document the contact in CASE/NOTEs.

However if an applicant wants a deduction from their income for expenses such as housing costs, medical, child support, or dependent care expenses , request verification in writing allowing 10 days for the applicant to provide the non- mandatory verification(s) even if all mandatory verification(s) have been provided. When the 10- day period to provide the non- mandatory verification(s) extends past the 30 day processing period, do not process the application until the applicant has had 10 days to provide the non- mandatory verification(s). Send a delay notice from the MAXIS system on the 30th day. When the non- mandatory expense verification(s) are provided within the 10- day period, process the application with the verified deduction(s) in the benefit calculation effective with the date of the application. When the non- mandatory expense verification(s) are NOT provided within the 10 day period, process the application without the non-mandatory expense(s) included in the benefit calculation effective with the date of the application. If the non- mandatory verification(s) is provided later, allow the verified non- mandatory expense beginning with the month after the month the verification was prov ided. When the applicant states they do not want the non- mandatory expense deduction used to determine their benefits for their application, and the unit has provided all the mandatory verifications, document the applicant's verbal statement in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs. Provide the unit with a request for the non- mandatory verifications. Process the application without waiting for the 10-day period to run. During future months of the certification period, the recipient can provide the non- mandatory expense verification. The worker will then include the non- mandatory expense in the benefit calculation for the month after the month the verification is provided. See SNAP provisions in 0008.06.01 (Implementing Changes - Program Provisions) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 02/2019 DELAYS IN PROCESSING APPLICATIONS 0005.12.15.03 On occasion, it may not be possible to determine eligibility within the time frames listed in 0005.12.15 (Application Processing Standards) because clients fail or refuse to provide information.

On STAT/ADME in MAXIS, add mandatory people in the benefit month they arrived in the household. Calculate overpayments from the arrival month, if not reported timely. Calculate restorations/supplements from the 1st of the month the addendum is filed. Budget a new member's income prospectively for the 1st 2 months even if the unit is in a retrospective cycle, EXCEPT: If the new person was on MFIP in the previous month, continue the budget cycle the person was in. If you were already considering the person's income in determining the unit's grant, continue the current budget cycle. See 0016 (Income From P eople Not in the Unit) . When the new member is not reported timely, begin the 1st 2 prospective months with the month of arrival. The new member's income and assets, combined with the unit's income and assets, must be within the income and asset limits for an ongoing case. If the new unit's assets exceed the limit and the person is a mandatory unit member, close the case. If the COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 ADDING A PERSON TO THE UNIT - CASH 0008.06.06 person is not a mandatory member, deny eligibility for that person.

If the determination is made more than 30 days after the DWP application date, have the participant complete a Minnesota Transition Application Form (MT AF) (DHS -5223E) (PDF) as part of the conversion process. Terminate DWP allowing for proper notice. SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 REMOVING OR RECALCULATING INCOME 0008.06.15 Follow these procedures for removing income in certain situations. Also see 0022.03 (How and When to Use Prospective Budgeting) , 0022.06 (How and When to Use Retrospective Budgeting), 0022.06.03 (When Not to Budget Income in Retro. Cases) , 0022.09 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - Cash) , 0022.09.03 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - SNAP) . If the changes in income result in potential eligibility for other benefits, see 0012.12 (Applying for Other Benefits) . Different provisions may apply to receipt of lump sums. See 0022.15 (Counting Lump Sums as Income) . MFIP: It may be possible to supplement a unit's grant if the unit reports a significant change in income. A significant change is when the unit's gross earned and/or unearned income for the payment month declines by $65 plus 50% or more from the gross earned and/or unearned income budgeted in the budget month. Do not consider significant change as restored benefits. If the unit reports that it expects income to decline, act right away. The unit must verify the income will decrease or end before you issue the supplement. Do not wait until the end of the month to verify the exact amount of the decrease. See TEMP Manual TE19.156 (QTIP #156 - MFIP Stop Work Procedures). For information on verifying changes in income, see Chapter 10 (Verification) . The unit may only receive a supplement for a change it reports in the current month or for the month before. Issue a supplement no more than 7 days after the unit verifies the change. Do not issue a supplement for a grant you have not yet issued. Budget adjustments that result from significant changes are limited to 2 in a 12 month period, regardless of the reason for the change. Count back 12 months from the month the client is requesting the change to determine eligibility for significant change. If the unit reports (and verifies) a decrease in actual or expected income, follow these procedures to determine the supplement to issue. 1. Calculate the unit's gross income , including deemed income, for the month. See 0016 (Income From People Not in the Unit) , 0017 (Determining Gross Income) . 2. Subtract the figure in Step 1 from the gross income , including deemed income , from the budget month. 3. Subtract $65 from the unit's gross income, including deemed income, from t he budget month. 4. Multiply the amount from Step 3 ( gross income from the budget month minus $65) by 0.50. 5. If the amount in Step 2 is less than the amount in Step 4, there is no significant change. If the amount in Step 2 is equal to or greater than the amount in Step 4, go to Step 6. 6. Recalculate the current month's grant using the client's reported income. 7. Subtract the amount of the grant you issued from the amount in Step 6. Issue the difference as a supplement.

There are certain case transfer procedures which county agencies must follow. Follow the provisions below to transfer an active or pending case which is on MAXIS to another county. These procedures apply to all cases EXCEPT temporary placements of less than 90 days and moves to d omestic violence shelters . You may choose not to transfer those cases. Update the address on MAXIS. Do not transfer the case until the unit has actually moved. Do NOT terminate or deny assistance. Complete as much of the outstandi ng work on the case as possible. Record in MAXIS case notes what work was not completed and the reason. Process an application or recertification that is due if you have held the mandatory face -to-face interview. For DWP cases, see the provisions under DWP. When the mandatory face- to-face interview for an application or recertification has already been held in the sending county, it is up to the receiving county to decide whether it would be easier to complete processing of the case in the county to which the unit has just moved. The 2 counties should agree to this prior to the case tra nsfer. If the face- to-face interview has not been completed, do not process the application or recertification and note this in the MAXIS case notes. Send a Change Report Form (DHS -2402) (PDF) to the unit with instructions to return the form to the new county of residence within 10 days of your mailing date. For informatio n that does not interface from MAXIS to WorkForce One, send a DWP/MFIP Status Update Form (DHS -3165) (PDF) if applicable, to the Employment Services Provider and the child care wor ker. Follow the checklist and procedures in TEMP Manual TE02.08.133 (Completing an Inter County Case Transfer) and TE02.08.134 (SPEC/XFER for Inter County Case Transfers) to transfer the case to the new county of residence using the SPEC/XFER panel. Transfer the electronic case to the new county by the later of these dates: - One working day after the date you received the report of the move. OR - The end of the day after the date of the move. Do not transfer the case until the unit has actually moved. Purge the physical case record using current record retention policies. Send the physical case record to the new county of residence within 5 working days after the date of the reported change or move, whichever is later. At county option, use the Inter Agency Case Transfer Form (DHS -3195) (PDF) for transferring a case. There may be situations where an applicant or participant unit moves to a new county but your county remains financially responsible. Follow the transfer procedures outlined above. You may need to keep a mini -file for administrative payments, such as burials. Follow the provisions below when your county receives a transfer of an active or pending case on MAXIS due to a change in county of residence: Accept the case. Any issues related to electronic or paper cases received in unsatisfactory condition should be resolved at the supervisory level or above. Client service must never be interrupted during negot iations. Verify that the transferred case address is within your county. If it is not, immediately transfer the case to the correct county and notify the sending county so that they can transfer the physical case file to the correct county. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2018 CHANGE IN COUNTY OF RESIDENCE 0008.06.21 Check the financial responsibility begin date on the SPEC/XFER panel and correct it if nec essary. MAXIS will automatically transfer financial responsibility on the date listed. See 0006.06 (Moving Between Counties - Participants) . When you receive the Change Report Form (DHS -2402) (PDF) from the unit, update MAXIS with new or changed information. Complete the application process, recertification process, or other outstanding work as necessary. Send a referral to the Employment Services Provider and child care worker in your county unless the client is exempt. See 0028.06.10 (Who Is Exempt From SNAP E&T ). If you d o not get the Change Report Form (DHS -2402) (PDF) from the unit within 10 days of the date mailed by the former county, generate a 10 day notice to close the case. See 0026.12.03 (10 Day Notice) . See TEMP Manual TE02.09.14 (How to Transfer a Single Claim) and TE02.09.18 (When to Transfer a MAXIS Claim) for when and how to transfer a MAXIS claim to another county. To determine which county is financially responsible for which months, see 0006 (Determining Financial Responsibility) . MFIP: You do need to verify the new address, see 0011.09 (County Residence) . Participants in the Safe At Home (SAH) Program only need to verify their county of residence, see 0029.29 (Safe At Home Program) . When a minor child getting MFIP moves to another county to live with a different caregiver, the former county must remove the child from the unit effective the month after the move. See 0006.09 (Moving Between Counties - Minor Children) . If there is not enough time to send the unit a notice, remove the child effective the 2nd month after the move. See 0026 (Notices) . There is no overpayment if they report the move timely. The new county must take an application or addendum for the child. See 0005.09.03 (When People Must Complete an Application) , 0005.09.09 (When to Use an Addendum to an Application) , 0008.06.06 (Adding a Person to the Unit - Cash) . It is possible for a child to get benefits from 2 different counties in the same month. See 0011.21 (Receipt of Other Assistance) . DWP: For applicants: When a move between counties occurs before the application has been approved and before the employm ent plan (EP) has been developed, the case must be transferred to the new county. The receiving county must meet with the applicant prior to approval to develop an EP that includes activities that fit with the applicant and the receiving county. When t he application has not been approved, but the EP has been d eveloped in the first county, it is up to the receiving county to decide whether it would be easier to complete processing the case in the county to which the unit has just moved. The 2 counties should agree to this prior to the case transfer. For par ticipants: When a move between counties occurs during the 4 -month DWP period and the participant continues to meet DWP eligibility criteria, the case will remain on DWP. The new county MUST meet with the participant to develop an Employment Plan (EP) that builds on the work that had been done in the previous county. This does NOT apply to Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2018 CHANGE IN COUNTY OF RESIDENCE 0008.06.21 SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions, EXCEPT send a Change Report Form (DHS -2402) (PDF) to change reporting units only. For information on reporting unscheduled changes, see 0007.15.03 (Unscheduled Reporting of Changes - SNAP) . You do not need to verify the new address, but do verify which county the new address is in. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2017 DWP CONVERSION OR REFERRAL TO MFIP 0008.06.24 MFIP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. DWP: CONVERSION/REFERRAL DURING THE 4 -MONTH DWP PERIOD If at any time during the DWP application process or during the 4- month DWP eligibility period, you determine that a participant is unlikely to benefit from DWP, convert or refer the participant to MFIP. For the definition of MFIP, see 0002.41 (Glossary: Medically Necessary...) . Participants who meet any of the eligibility criteria for Family Stabilization Services (FSS) are considered UNLIKELY to benefit from DWP. Gather the necessary documentation to support the determination. The following are the FSS eligibility criteria for determining if a participant is unlikely to benefit from DWP: The participant is app lying for SSI/RSDI (Retirement Survivors Disability Insurance). This includes those who are appealing a denial of an SSI or RSDI application. A participant who is age 60 or over or a participant who will turn 60 during the proposed 4 DWP months. A participant is a legal non -citizen who has been in the United States 12 months or less. \"12 months\" is defined as 12 FULL months after the month of entry. The participant has a Family Violence Waiver and is complying wit h an Employment Plan. The pa rticipant has an illness, injury, or incapacity that has been certified by a qualified professional, the condition is expecte d to continue for more than 30 days and severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. The par ticipant's presence in the home is required as a caregiver due to the illness, injury, or incapacity of another member in the assistance unit, a relative in the household, or a foster child in the household when the condition, and the need for a person to provide assistance in the home, has been certified by a qualified professional and is expected to continue for more than 30 days. The participant has a child or adult in the household who meets disability or medica l criteria for home care services, a home and community -based waiver services program, or meets the criteria for severe emotional disturbance or serious and persistent mental illness. The participant has been diagnosed by a licensed physician, psycholo gical practitioner, or other qualified professional, as developmentally disabled or mentally ill and the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. The participant has been assessed by a vocational speci alist or the county agency to be unemployable. The participant has an IQ below 80, and has been assessed by a vocational specialist or a county agency to be employabl e but the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitabl e employment. The participant was determined by a qualified professional to be learning disabled, and the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. A family unit with a refugee caregiver who arrived in the U. S. within 12 months of applying for family cash assistance or a family unit with an asylee caregiver who is approved for asylee status within 12 months of applying for family cash assistance. NOTE: \"Severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment\" means that a qualified professional has determined that the person's condition prevents the person from working 20 or more hours per we ek. Also, in a single pregnant woman unit once the child is born the unit is not eligible for DWP unless the parent has already used all the months of the child under 12 months ES exemption. Take a Combined Application Form (CAF) Addendum (DHS -5223C) COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2017 DWP CONVERSION OR REFERRAL TO MFIP 0008.06.24 (PDF) for the newborn and move the case to MFIP. If the determination is made more than 30 days after the DWP application date, have the participant complete a Minnesota Transition Application Form (MTAF) (DHS -5223E) (PDF) as part of the referral process. Terminate DWP allowing for proper notice. In a 2- parent unit, only 1 parent MUST meet 1 of the \"unlikely to benefit from DWP\" criteria above before converting or referring the family to MFIP. Make the transition from DWP to MFIP as smooth as possible for families that leave DWP and begin receiving MFIP assistance. Send appropriate notices when closing DWP and SNAP. If the transition from DWP to MFIP occurs within 30 days of the initial DWP application date, convert the case without completion of a new CAF. If the transition occurs more than 30 days after the initial DWP application date, have the participant submit a Minnesota Transition Application Form (MTAF) (DHS- 5223E) (PDF) . Process the DHS -5223E by the 1st of the month following the month it is received to ensure that there is no gap in benefits due to delayed action by the county. Enter the date of the Minnesota Transition Application Form (MTAF) (DHS -5223E) (PDF) on the STAT/PROG panel in MAXI S as the application date for a new cash program. Only require verification of information necessary to determine MFIP eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment. Do not require additional verification of the inform ation from the DWP application unless the information is inaccurate, questionable, or no longer current. CONVERSION/REFERRAL AFTER THE 4 -MONTH DWP PERIOD ENDS Because DWP is a short -term program, families must exit the program no later than 3 months after the month in which DWP ini tial month benefits are issued. Some DWP participants may not have successfully obtained unsubsidized employment that allows them to support their families without having to apply for benefits under MFIP. Inform DWP job seekers without earned income or with little earned income about the possibility of receiving cash and food benefits through MFIP. Tell the DWP job seeker about other resources, including MFIP, when the job seeker asks about other help. When a participant has exhausted 4 months of DWP, he/she may complete, sign, and submit a Minnesota Transition Application Form (MTAF) (DHS -5223E) (PDF) , rather than a Combined Application Form (CAF), to apply for MFIP provided the request is made within 30 days of the end of the 4th month of DWP. The application process begins the date a MTAF with a name, address and signature is received. See 0005.10 (Minnesota Transition Application Form (MTAF) ), 0005.12.15 (Application Processing Standards ) for information on how to process an MTAF. If the request is not made within 30 days of the end of the 4- month DWP eligibility period, the participant must complete a new Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) (PDF) . All applicants must meet the initial income test to be eligible for MFIP. See 0017 (Determining Gross Income) , 0018 (Determining Net Income) , 0018.18 (Earned Income Disregards) , 0022.03.01 (Prospective Budgeting - Program Provisions ). Work with families that leave DWP but do not go onto MFIP to determine which, if any, transition or post -program services and supports would help the family achieve or maintain economic and family stability. For example, SNAP, Child Care and/or Health Care benefits may continue. CONVERTING A CAREGIVER WHO TURNS 60 YEARS OLD DURING THE 4 -MONTH DWP PERIOD If a caregiver in a 1- parent unit will be tur ning 60 years old during the proposed 4 DWP months, open MFIP rather than DWP at application. SNAP: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2017 DWP CONVERSION OR REFERRAL TO MFIP 0008.06.24 No provisions. DWP SNAP participants who transition to MFIP will have their stand- alone SNAP benefits closed in order to have the MFIP food portion approved. Close the stand- alone SNAP for the 1st possible month, allowing a 10- day notice. The MFIP food portion must not be issued for a unit member whose needs have already been covered in a SNAP unit . See 0011.21 (Receipt of Other Assistance) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 RECERTIFICATION 0009 Review eligibility regularly. The schedule for reviews depends on the program and household circumstances. Some programs require more frequent reviews for certain client circumstances. The time between initial eligibility and the date a county agency must review the case, or the time between required reviews, is the certification period. See 0009.03 (Length of Recertification Periods) , 0009.03.03 (When to Adjust the Length of Certification) . Recertify clients who are eligible for ongoing assistance. Counties must use forms developed by DHS for the purposes of informing and advising clients about their rights and responsibilities, the status of an application or recertification, and ongoing eligibility for assistance. If DHS does not provide a form for a given purpose, the county agency may develop its own form. The form must meet the requirements in TEMP Manual TE12.02.01 (County Designed Forms). See 0009.06 (Recertification Process) for the process and forms to use. Some programs require an interview as part of the recertification process. See 0009.06.06 (Recertification Interview) . The recertification process must be completed within set time frames. See 0009.06.03 (Recertification Processing Standards) . For IV -E Foster Care clients, follow the procedures of your county Social Services unit for recertification. MFIP: All clients must complete a CAF or ApplyMN application and provide required verifications to be recertified. DWP: No provisions. SNAP: Clients MUST complete a CAF, ApplyMN applicati on or a Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations , have an interview, and provide required verifications to be recertified. See 0009.06.06 (Recertification Interview) . A signed and dated Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS- 5223) , ApplyMN application or Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations (DHS -3727) must be filed with the human services agency in the client's county of residence. EXCEPTION: Households in which all members are recipients of or applicants for SSI may file a CAF or Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations at a Social Security Administration (SSA) office. DO NOT require units to report for a face- to-face interview during the certification period. MSA, GRH: Clients living in the community must complete a Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) , ApplyMN application or Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations (DHS -3727) and provide required verification to be r ecertified. Clients living in the community but receiving waivered services that require an LTC budget and who do not meet the criteria for the Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations, must complete the Minnesota Health Care Programs Renewal for People Receiving Long- Term Care Services (DHS -2128) . Clients who are LTCF residents for whom MA pays the cost of care, must complete the DHS -2128. GA: All clients must complete a Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) or ApplyMN application and provide required verifications to be recertified. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 LENGTH OF RECERTIFICATION PERIODS 0009.03 Assign the longest certification period possible based on the client's circumstances. See the specific program provisions be low for the maximum length of time between reviews for each program. Certify people for less than the maximum time to coincide with expected changes or another program's review date. The client's review date should, if possible, be the same for all programs. If you are determining eligibility for 2 cash programs at the same time, the review date must be the same. If 1 cash program is active and you are adding any other program, you must either: - Review eligibility for the active cash program at the ti me you add the other program. OR - Set the review date for the program you are adding to the same review date as the existing cash program. EXCEPT for individual GA participants without a verified residence address, the certification period conforms to calendar months. Count the month of application as the 1st month of the certification period unless the client is not eligible in that month. The certification period ends at 12:01 a.m. on the 1st day of the month following the last month of the certi fication period. See 0009.03.03 (When to Adjust the Length of Certification) . MFIP, MSA, GRH: Recertify eligibility at least once every 12 months. DWP: No provisions. SNAP: Recertify units whose adu lts are ALL elderly or disabled without earned income at least once every 24 months. You must have contact with these units at least every 12 months, to remind them of when they must report changes and what changes must be reported. For MAXIS instructions, see TEMP Manual TE02.08.165 ( SNAP Aged/Disabled 12 Month Contacts). Recertify all other units at least once every 12 months. However, some units may have their recertification period set for less than 12 months if: The u nit's circumstances are unsta ble due to being homeless. OR It appears the unit will be ineligible for SNAP in the near future. When a recertification is set for less than 12 months, CASE/NOTEs must be completed to document the reason for the shorter certification period. No units should have a recertification period longer than 24 months. GA: Follow MFIP with the following EXCEPTION: A county agency may choose to certify eligibility weekly for individual participants who are without a verified residence address. See 0024.03.03 (When Benefits Are Paid - SNAP/MSA/GA/GRH) , 0024.04.09 (GA Weekly Issuance) . A county agency which chooses to recertify eligibility weekly must use a form approved by DHS for weekly recertification and NOT use the Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 WHEN TO ADJUST THE LENGTH OF CERTIFICATION 0009.03.03 See 0009.03 (Length of Recertification Periods) for setting the certification period and the maximum length of time between reviews for each program. County agencies may increase or decrease the certification period to coincide with expected changes or another program's review date. The adjusted date must not exceed the maximum number of months allowed by the specific program between reviews. Adjust the length of the certification period to reduce the number of times to request information and review eligibility factors. MFIP, MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions. DWP: No provisions. SNAP: Once the certification period has been established in MAXIS, do NOT change the recertification date . There is no change in the recertification date when there is less than 1 month break in eligibility. See 0005.09.06 (When Not to Require Completion of an Application) . Loss of cash benefits or a change in the unit's employment status are NOT reasons to shorten a certification period. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2019 RECERTIFICATION PROCESS 0009.06 Recertify clients whose certification period is ending. The clients and the agency must follow the time frames of each progr am for completing the recertification process. See 0009.06.03 (Recertification Processing Standards) . MAXIS will generate program specific cover letters and mail the following forms: Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) (PDF) . Combined Six -Month Report (DHS -5576) (PDF) . Combined Six -Month Report Supplement for Cash Programs (DHS -5576A) (PDF) . Combined Annual Renewal fo r Certain Populations (DHS -3727) (PDF) . Other notices or forms required at recertification according to each program's provisions below. All questions on the form must be answered for the form to be considered complete. MAXIS will mail packets aro und the 15th of the 2nd month prior to the end of the certification period. Accept an ApplyMN application from a current participant as a recertification if received within the recertification processing period. If an ApplyMN application submitted during the recertification processing period contains a request for a new assist ance program, process the ApplyMN application as a new application for the new p rogram. The recertification process is similar to the application process. To complete the recertification process: Review eligibility for the client's current programs, possible new programs, and emergency need. If clients q ualify for new programs or emergency assistance, process the recertification request as an application for assistance. See 0004 (Emergencies) , 0005 (Applications), 0009.06.03 (Recertification 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) . To request verifications, send the Notice of Late or Incompl ete Household Report Form, Health Care Renewal Form or Combined Six -Month Report or Recertification (DHS - 2414) (PDF) to the unit with the following information: - The date benefits will be terminated. - The date the recertification form was received. - The verifications that are needed. Notify the unit of the eligibility determination. See 0026 (Notices) . Accept the Combined Application Form ( CAF) , ApplyMN application, Combined Six-Month Report (CSR ) or Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations even if the client does not live in your county. See 0005.12 (Accepting and Processing Applications) . In addition to MAXIS -generated recertification packets, you may be required to provide certain additional forms to clients at the face-to-face recertification interview. See 0007.12 (Agency Responsibilities for Client Reporting) , 0009.06.06 (Recertification Interview) . Give a 10- day notice before terminating benefits if the unit fails to comply with the recertification process. See 0009.06.03 (Recertification Processing Standards) . If a 10 -day notice is not sent, continue to issue benefits until a 10- day notice of adverse action can be given. This applies even if the certification period has ended. MFIP: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2019 RECERTIFICATION PROCESS 0009.06 For MFIP units subject to monthly reporting, the CAF must be signed and dated by the caregiver(s) on or after the last day of the reporting period. For MFIP units not subject to monthly reporting, the CAF can be signed and dated by the caregiver(s) any time after the date MAXIS mailed the recertification packet. MAXIS will also include the Domestic Violence Information (DHS -3477) (PDF) in the recertification packet . Give the client the Family Violence Referral (DHS -3323) (PDF) . Provide information about counseling and support services, and permanent residence procedures for battered non -citizens. Review the continued exemption from the 60- month time limit for victims of family violence for whom you have an Employment Plan (EP) in place. See 0005.12.12.09 (Family Violence Provisions/Referrals) , 0010.18.33 (Verifying Family Violence) . Conduct a recertification interview at least once every 12 months. See 0009.06.06 (Recertification Interview) . Review extensions for participants who have been extended beyond the 60- month lifetime limit every 12 months, unless the documentation supporting the extension indicates the participant's condition could change earlier. See 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions) . This review should be considered a minimum requirement to recertify an extension. Review the situation and request new verification each time there is a change in the estimated end date. Counties should end an extension prior to the review , if criteria for the extension no longer apply. End the extension the 1st of the month following verification that the criteria no longer apply. NOTE: Participants may move between extension categories. Coordinate extension reviews with recertifications, if possible. Do not consider the client ineligible and therefore subject to an overpayment solely because the agency fails to send a timely notice of termination. Consider it an overpayment only if the client does not meet eligibility factors such as income, asset s, or basis of eligibility. If the unit is ineligible for continued benefits or will receive reduced benefits based on information in the CAF or ApplyMN application, or if the information requires a reduction or suspension of the unit's benefits, send a notice BEFORE the effective date of the adverse action. DWP: No provisions. SNAP: The CAF can be signed and dated by the client any time after the date MAXIS mailed the recertification packet. MAXIS will also include the Change Report Form (DHS -2402) (PDF) (for change reporting units) in the recertification packet .

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2019 RECERTIFICATION PROCESSING STANDARDS 0009.06.03 Units who receive a notice of expiration at the time of certification due to a 1 - or 2-month certification period have returned the CAF timely if the county agency gets it within 15 days after the unit received the notice of expi ration. For Change Reporting units and Six -Month Reporting units, a CAF received in the last month of the certification period is considered an application for recertification. - A CAF received by the 15th day of the last month of the certification period is subject to timely processing. Timely processing means there is time to schedule the interview, request required verifications and allow the unit 10 days to return verifications so that there will not be an interruption in the receipt of their SNAP benefits. - A CAF received after the 15th but before the last day of the last month of the certification period, is subject to delayed processing. Delayed processing means there may not be time to schedule the interview, request required verifications and allow the unit 10 days to return verifications in time for the unit to receive benefits on their normal stagger issuance date. The 10 -day period for returning verifications may extend beyond the end of the certification period. If the unit provi des verifications after the certification period, but within the 10 days, determine eligibility and issue benefits no more than 5 days after receiving verification. See 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) . The time frame within which you must take action on the recertification depends on when the unit returns the CAF. See 0009.06.06 (Recertification Interview) , Missing Verifications) for MAXIS instructions. For units who submit the CAF before the 15th day of the last month of the certification period (timely processing), complete an interview, if required, on the date scheduled and provide necessary verification by the date scheduled: - If determined eligible, approve benefits in time for them to get benefits on the date they usually get their benefits. - If determined INELIGIBLE, close the case on or before the last day of the certification period. For units who submit the CAF before the 15th day of the last month of the certification period (timely processing), but fail to complete the interview by the end of the certification period AND/OR do not provide verifications before the scheduled date, close the case at the end of the certification period. - If the unit takes the required action within 30 days after the end of the certification period, reopen the case and PRORATE benefits from the date the unit took the required action. For units who submit the CAF after the 15th but before the last day of the last month of the certification period (delayed processing), complete an interview, if required, on the date scheduled and provide necessary verification by the date scheduled: - If determined eligible, approve benefits. Due to delayed processing the unit may not receive benefits on their normal date. - If determined INELIGIBLE, close the case on or before the last day of the certification period. For units who submit the CAF after the 15th but before the last day of the last month of the certification period (delayed processing), but fail to complete the interview by the end of the certification period AND/OR do not provide verifications be fore the scheduled date, close th e case at the end of the certification period. - If the unit takes the required action within 30 days after the end of the certification period, reopen the case and PRORATE benefits from the date the unit took the required action. For units who do not submit the CAF in the last month of the certification period, close the case on or before the last day o f the certification period.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 VERIFICATION 0010 All programs require verification of certain information. See 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) . Verify other information to determine eligibility or a benefit amount if the information the client gives is inconsistent or questionable. See 0010.15 (Verification - Inconsistent Information) . Any form of written or electronic verification is acceptable if it confirms the client's statement. Do not demand a specific document or form of verification if another is more readily available. Sources of verification include: Written records or documents. See 0010.06 (Sources of Verification - Documents) . Writte n or oral statements from people outside assistance units. See 0010.09 (Sources of Verification, Collateral Contacts) . Direct observation at home visits. See 0010.12 (Sources of Verification - Home Visits) . Providing proof is the responsibility of the client. You must help clients who have trouble getting proof. Clients must either provide necessary proof or give their written consent for you to get the information. When proof is not available despite the efforts of you and the client, get a signed statement from the client attesting to the correctness of the information. See 0010.03 (Verification - Cooperation and Consent) for specifics, including limits on when a signed statement is acceptable. Deny or end assistance to people who refuse or deliberately fail to help verify information. The date a client verifies a factor of eligibility may affect the date of eligibility. See 0005 (Applications), 0005.12 (Accepting and Processing Applications) , 0005.12.15 (Application Processing Standards) , 0022.12.02 (Beginning Date of Eligibility) .

For a list of countable assets, see 0015.01 (Counted Assets) . SNAP: Follow general provisions. See 0010.06 (Sources of Verification - Documents) for when to use verbal statements as verification. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2016 VERIFICATION - COOPERATION AND CONSENT 0010.03 Clients have the primary responsibility to verify information. When you need non -public information for proof, clients must get documents themselves or give you written permission to contact 3rd parties to verify their statements. To use a collateral contact for proof, the client must help identify a contact. If a suitable collateral contact cannot verify or refuses to verify the facts, the client must help find another contact. A contact's refusal to cooperate is not the client's refusal to cooperate. See 0010.09 (Sources of Verification, Collateral Contacts) . Consent from a client to contact a 3rd party must include the name of the specific contact person and the specific information you need. A written consent may cover more than 1 3rd- party source, but must name each source individually. You may use the Authorization for Release of Information About Assets (DHS -2243) (PDF) a nd the General Authorization For Release of Information (DHS -2243A) (PDF) form. If a client refuses to help or deliberately fails to cooperate to verify an eligibility factor, deny or terminate benefits. If the unverified eligibility factor affects only the client (such as immigration status), deny or end the client's eligibility. If the unverified factor affects the entire unit (such as income), deny or close the case. MFIP, DWP: When proof is not available in the situations below, accept a signed personal statement from the client attesting to the corr ectness of the information: A claim of family violence if used as a basis to qualify for the family violence waiver. Relationship of minor child to caregiver. EXCEPTION: DO NOT accept a signed statement from the caregiver as proof of paternity. R efer the father to the county support office to establish paternity. Citizenship status from a noncitizen who reports to be, or is identified as, a victim of severe forms of trafficking in persons, if the noncitizen reports that the noncitizen's immigration documents are being held by an individual or group of individuals against the noncitizen's will. The noncitizen must follow up with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to pursue certification. If verification that certification is being pursued is not received within 30 days, close the MFIP case and pursue overpayments. If the ORR documents certifying the noncitizen's status as a victim of severe forms of trafficking in persons, or the reason for the delay in processing, are not received within 90 days, close the MFIP case and pursue overpayments. Other docume ntation unavailable for reasons beyond the control of th e client when reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the documents requested. SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: When a client cooperates but you still cannot find an adequate source of proof, work with the client to find the best availab le information. Get a signed statement from the client attesting to the correctness of the information. Do not deny benefits because you cannot get proof if the client has made all reasonable efforts. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2018 SOURCES OF VERIFICATION - DOCUMENTS 0010.06 Use documents, when available, to verify a client's statement. This includes documents from public agencies, documents the client has, or any written confirmation of a client's statements from a source outside the unit. If you need a specific document and the client does not have money to get it, your agency must pay for the cost. For electronic verification, see 0010 (Verification) . Place the original or a copy of the document in the case file if possible. Return original copies of documents, such as, birth certificates and marriage licenses, to the client. Keep original copies of DHS forms or other statements the client or someone else completes in the case file. When photocopying savings bonds or other negotiable items, you must alter the size of the items by reducing or enlarging. It is illegal to photocopy savings bonds without altering the size. If it is not possible to get an original or a copy of the document, describe the document in the case notes. Include: The nature or title of the document. The source. The date the document was completed or signed. Identifying numbers or codes. The content. Other pertinent information about the document. NOTE : If an applicant provides a birth certificate issued by Puerto Rico as a verification, contact the Local Agency Support Policy Center through PolicyQuest. MFIP, DWP: Written records or documents are required to verify the familial relationship of a minor child to the child's parental or non- parental caregiver. Verification must establish the relationship of the minor child to the parent and, if necessary, the parent to the non- parental caregiver. Verification is not limited to birth certificates Consecutively numbered I -94 cards do not prove relationship of a caregiver to a child. Accept a signed statement when written records establishing relationship do not exist in the former country, or written records exist but attempts to obtain them have not been successful. Contact the Policy Center with questions about whether an INS form other than the I -94 can establish relationship of a caregiver to a child . The agency can use a signed personal statement as verification of ineligibility based on the income and/or assets an applicant reports on the Combined Application Form. Inform the applicant of the reason they are ineligible. SNAP: Follow general provisions. Allow a verbal statement made during the interview as verification of ineligibility based on the income an applicant reports on the Combined Application Form. MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions. The agency can use a signed personal statement as verification of ineligibility based on the income and/or assets an applicant reports on the Combined Application Form.

You may confirm the information with the collateral contact. Get written permission from the client before contacting the collateral source. You and the client must agree on the suitability of the contact. If a suitable collateral contact cannot verify or refuses to verify the information, the client must cooperate in trying to find another contact. A contact's refusal to cooperate does not constitute the client's refusal to cooperate. If a suitable contact is not available, use another method of verification. If possible, get a signed, written statement from the collateral contact to place in the case file. If this is not possible, place a written description of the contact in the case file, including: The contact's title, address, and phone number, if avai lable. The date of the contact. A description of the information in the case notes. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 07/1998 SOURCES OF VERIFICATION - HOME VISITS 0010.12 The agency can verify some information, such as residence, by direct observation in a client's home.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 VERIFYING CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION STATUS 0010.18.11 People who report that they are not United States citizens may have several factors that require verification. Non- citizens will generally have 1 of 2 forms (I -551 or I -94) that indicates current immigration status and the date it was attained. See 0010.18.24 (Verification - I-94 Card s), 0010.18.27 (Verification - I-551 Card) . Factors that you must verify include: Current immigration status: A non -citizen's status relates to permission to live and work in the United States. A lawful permanent resident (LPR) has permanent permission to live and work in the United States. See 0010.18.15 (Verifying Lawful Permanent Residence) , 0010.18.15.03 (Lawful Permanent Resident: USCIS Class Codes) , 0011.03.12 (Non -Citizens - Lawful Permanent Residents) . Some people only have permission to live here for a temporary period and may need to apply for permission to work. Other people may only have permission to reside here on a temporary basis and are ineligible to work in the United States. See 0011.03.24 (Non- Citizens - Lawfully Residing People) , 0011.03.27 (Undocumented and Non- Immigrant People) . NOTE: An expired immigrat ion document is NOT acceptable verification of current status. Do not assume that an expired document is an indication that the immigration status has changed or that the person should be considered undocumented. Verification of current immigration status is mandatory and eligibility does not exist until it is received. Obtain a signed release of information to contact USCIS to verify the person's immigration status. An Employment Authorization card may indicate immigration status, but in cases where entry date or status date are also needed, additional verification may be required. Date of entry to the United States or date status granted: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 was signed on 8- 22-96. Elig ibility for federally -funded programs for non- citizens who arrived in the United States on or after that date may be different than for those who arrived prior to that date. With some EXCEPTIONS, people entering after 8- 22-96 are subject to a 5- year bar to FEDERAL MEANS TESTED PROGRAMs, see 0002.23 (Glossary: Fair Hearing...) . For exceptions, see 0011.03.03 (Non- Citizens - MFIP/DWP Cash) . In some cases it may be necessary to verify eligibility factors by contacting USCIS, but ONLY a fter obtaining a release of information from the non- citizen household member. Refusing to sign a release of information is a bar to eligibility for the non- citizen household member(s) only. Assistance is available for the remaining household members who meet all other eligibility criteria. Do not attempt to verify the immigration status of household members who are not requesting assistance. After you have determined eligibility, you may be required to use the SAVE process for some programs. See 0010.18.11.03 (Systematic Alien Verification (SAVE) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2018 SYSTEMATIC ALIEN VERIFICATION (SAVE) 0010.18.11 .03 The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system is an inter -governmental information- sharing program that verifies immigration status, or naturalized/derived citizenship for applicants of federal, state and local public benefits. SAVE provides 2 methods to verify status - a secure electronic (primary), and a paper (secondary) method. SAVE is administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Use SAVE to verify the immigration status, or naturalized/derived citizenship of applicants for MFIP, DWP, SNAP, GA, MSA, GRH, RCA, and MFAP. Also use SAVE to verify a change in immigration status of participants. For SAVE to verify an applicant's status, the agency must have: The applicant's first name, last name and date of birth . AND A numeric identifier fro m a USCIS document. For example: - Form I Arrival/Departure Record Resident Card . - Employment Authoriza tion Document . - Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) ID number . - Certificate of Naturalization or Citizenship . - Valid/unexpired foreign passport number. Do NOT use SAVE: For people who are not applying for benefits for themselves, even if they are applying on behalf of others. When a unit withdraws its application for assistance. When a unit transitions from one cash program to another without a break in eligibility, unless a change of status is reporte d. For APPLICANTS: 1. Request USCIS documents from non -citizen(s) and/or those reporting naturalized, or derived citizenship. If the applicant cannot locate their paper documents, but is able to provide a numeric identifier, such as the Alien or USCIS number, use the number to query SAVE. 2. Use the documents provided to find the following: first name, last name, date of birth, and a USCIS numeric identifier. Expired documents can be used to find these biographic identifiers, with the exception of passports. Passports must be valid/unexpired. 3. Submit electronic SAVE query. Do not use the paper based verification method unless required by SAVE. 4. Once you receive the SAVE results, enter the immigration status verified by SAVE on the STAT/IMIG panel in M AXIS. 5. On STAT/IMIG u pdate the Status Ver field in MAXIS to either S1 (Save Primary/electronic) or S2 (SAVE Secondary/paper method). Do not use the paper method unless required by SAVE.

A private bill enacted by the United States Congress indicati ng permanent resident status. Inform immigrants without documentation, who say they are not undocumented, that they must provide USCIS documentation. Failure to provide verification results in ineligibility for the non- citizen household member(s) only. For MFIP, if they refuse to provide the verification the entire unit is ineligible. A child born outside the U.S. automatically becomes a U.S. citizen when: At least 1 parent of the child is a U.S. citizen, either by birth or naturalization . AND The child is under the age of 18. AND The child was lawfully admitted to the U.S. as an LPR and resides in the U.S. in the legal and physical custody o f their citizen parent. Children adopted abroad automatically acquire U.S. citizenship if the above conditions are met, and the adoption is full and final. Children deriving citizenship automatically through their parents do not necessarily have documents verifying their status. Do not require verification of naturalization for the children if you have the parent's documents. MFIP, DWP, SNAP, GA: Verify immigration status for people who report non- citizenship. Identify LPRs whose sole entrance reason is because someone petitioned for their entry into the United States. The name of the sponsor will not be on the immigrant's I -94, or temporary or permanent I -551. However, most codes on the card beginning with an I, C, or P indicate an LPR entered bec ause someone petitioned for the LPR's entrance. See 0010.18.15.03 (Lawful Permanent Resident: USCIS Class Codes) .

For procedures on verifying work credits using the SVES interface on MAXIS, see TEMP Manual TE02.12.15 (SVES Quarters of Coverage), TE02.12.24 (Social Security Credits). It is important to note that an individual's credits may also be credited from his or her current and/or deceased spouse, only for the credits worked during the spousal relationship, and credits worked by a parent before a child attains age 18 may be attributed to the child even after he/she becomes an adult. Add the number of credits that the applicant and any relevant individual have been in the United States. If the total equals 40 credits or more, continue. If not, the applicant is not eligible for federally -funded MFIP and SNAP. Follow these procedures if any of the years reported include any earned income for the applicant, the applicant's spouse, or the applicant's parents, count up to 4 credits in each calendar year for the applicant, and for each relevant individual: Always credit the applicant's own credits first and then the applicant's spouse and parents. AND Check U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) document ation for the date of entry into the country for the applicant, spouse, and/or parents. The date of entry should be consistent with the amount of work history claimed by these individuals. If the dates of entry are inconsistent with the years of earnings reported, the applicant is not eligible for federally -funded SNAP and federally -funded MFIP. Do not use a Consent for Release of Information Form (SSA -3288) for the applicant or applicant's spouse. By signing the CAF, the applicant or applicant's spouse are giving consent for SVES. Use the Consent for Release of Information Form for the person not covered by signing the application. If the applicant's spouse is not required to sign the application, you need a consent form. You need the consent form signed by the parent(s), stepparent(s), adoptive parent(s) or former spouse of the applicant when requesting credits to attribute to the applicant. In addition, you need the social security number of the parent(s), stepparent(s), adoptive(s) or former spouse. Do not complete the consent form if you are requesting information on a deceased individual's social security number. If a spouse or parent refuses to sign the consent or cannot be located, you cannot use SVES. Assist the applicant in contacting their local Social Security office, where they may be able to obtain the information. Do NOT count any credits after 12- 31-96 in which the person earning the credit also received assistance from a federal means tested program. See FEDERAL MEANS TESTED PROGRAM in 0002.23 (Glossary: Fair Hearing...) . Compare credits earned after 12- 31-96 to MAXIS participation records, and deduct the credit in which the person also received public assistance. Accept the client's statement as to receipt of public assistance in another state. See SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS in 0002.61 (Glossary: Self...) . Also see 0010.18.11 (Verifying Citizenship and Immigration Statu s), (Non- Citizens (Non- Citizens - LPR With Sponsors) . For correction of earning or discrepancies, the applicant can call the Social Security Administration at 1- 800-772-1213. LAG QUARTERS SSA may still be processing earnings for a previous period (lag quarters) and these earnings may not yet be on a person's record. Accept an employer's wage statement that includes FICA withholdings for the period in question, if those credits are needed to establish the 40 qualifying credits. See 0002.35 (Glossary: Inventory...) for the definition of LAG QUARTERS. Certify the household pending the results of the investigation for up to 6 months from the original date of insufficient credits if the household says that members have 40 credits, but the SSA cannot confirm the information and is conducting an investigation to determine if additional credits can be counted. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 03/2015 VERIFYING SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS 0010.18.15.06 Accept tax forms such as a W -2 and/or W -2c, employer wage statements, or an IRS copy of the individual's tax return, if there is a problem in the last taxable year. Follow these steps if the discrepancy is due to non- covered employment. Use the following process to establish and convert qualifying credits if the applicant does not meet the 40 qualifying quarter exception using covered earnings and alleges that he/she had additional work that is not documented by the SVES Interface or QUREY. 1. Review the SVES QUERY with the applicant or relevant individual to determine whether or not qualifying credits are missing. 2. Make the determination based on the information you have if the work credits are not missing. 3. Use the follow ing list of verifications to convert the information you have if work credits are missing: Form W-2 or W -2c. Employer prepared earnings statement. Statement of earnings signed by the custodian of the employer's records. IRS copy of the empl oyee's tax return. Timely -filed return for a self -employed individual with a canceled check, money o rder or copy of Schedule C - Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship) - with the IRS stamp. Be sure the tax return was filed no more than 3 years 3 months and 15 days after the year in which self -employment was earned. Other evidence such as bills, vouchers and receipts that would allow you to determine that the business did exist and that a profit was earned. Vouchers, pay -envelopes an d similar unsigned employer earnings statements to the employee, or a state or federal agency. Union records. Individual's personal records and statements. Other evidence of probate value. 4. If additional earnings exist, see TEMP Manual TE02 .12.24 (Social Security Credits) to determine the qualifying work credits. 5. To assign quarters before 1978 use: One credit for each calendar quarter if $50.00 or more was earned, including agricultural wages for 1951 - 1954. Four credits for eac h taxable year an individual's net earnings from self -employment were $400.00 or more. One credit earned for each $100.00 - limited to a total of four credits - for agricultural wages paid during the years of 1955 - 1977. MFIP: Follow general provisions for the food portion only.

People sponsoring relatives after that date are required to file this form, which remains in effect until the immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen, earns or can be credited with 40 Social Security Credits, leaves the United States permanently, or the immigrant or sponsor dies. Divorce does NOT terminate the obligation. See 0010.18.15.06 (Verifying Social Security Credits) . The older Affidavit of Support (Form I -134) was in use prior to 12- 97 and may be used for immigrants who are not sponsored by family members. See 0011.03.15 (Non- Citizens - LPR With Sponsors) , 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0016.21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134). SAVE AND I -864 SPONSOR INFORMATION To request sponsorship information using SAVE, check the \"Request Affidavit of Support Data\" box prior to submitting an automated additional verification request, and the Immigration Status Verifier (ISV) will provide this information when responding to the additional verification request if the non- citizen was sponsored on Form I -864, Affidavit of Support. If the immigrant was not sponsored using Form I -864, the ISV response will state \"This alien was not sponsored on Form I -864\", and you will need to pursue other means of securing the sponsorship information. If you have determined that the client has a sponsor, but the client is unable to provide the necessary s ponsor verification, you can electronically request Affidavit of Support data PRIOR to determining program eligibility from USCIS. Use SAVE to request specific sponsorship data through the automated additional verification request process. SAVE provides the following information regarding a client's sponsor(s): First, middle, and last name(s). Social security number(s). Last known address including street, city, state, and zip code. NOTE: Once SAVE responds with the name, SSN, and last known address for the individual's sponsor(s), the agency must secure a release of information from the client prior to contacting the sponsor to request income and asset verifications. Send a letter to remind the sponsor of his/her legal responsibility to provide support and request information regarding income and assets. If the sponsor and his/her spouse fail to respond to the letter and/or fail to provide verification of income and assets, deny the application or recertification unless you are able to reasonably determine that the immigrant meets an EXCEPTION from the deeming requirement. See 0016.21.03 (Income of Sponsors of LPRs With I -864) . Do not send a reminder letter if the immigrant is exempt from the deeming requirement under a battered status and the sponsor is responsible for the battery. MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general procedures. SNAP: For Categorical Eligible SNAP units who are sponsored, the assets of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse are not counted. No verification of these assets is needed.

This status is used for victims of crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse because of the crime AND who have information regarding the activity AND who are willing to assi st government officials in the investigation of the criminal activity. Undocumented people are non- citizens who do not have legal documentation authorizing their entry into the United States. Do not assume a non- citizen is here without U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) authorization just because the person does not have documentation. If the client is an undocumented person, deny the client for programs that require citizenship or legal entry status and determine eligibility for programs that do not.

Parolees are not on a predetermined path to permanent resident status. The I-94 will be stamped \"Parolee\" and may cite section 2129(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). REFUGEES: Refugees are people who have permission to enter and live in the United States because they have a well - founded fear of persecution in their home country. They will have an I -94 card stamped \"Admitted as a Refugee pursuant to section 207 of t he Act.\" The I -766 will be coded A03. PAROLED AS REFUGEES: People who fear persecution are \"paroled\" into the United States as refugees when the number of refugees allowed to enter has been exceeded. These parolees are given an I -94 with \"paroled as a refugee\" under 212(d)(5) . CUBAN/HAITIAN ENTRANTS : These individuals are issued an I -94 that is stamped \"Paroled.\" The I -94 may \"Humanitarian\", \"Significant Public Benefit\" Parolee. The count ry of citizenship listed on the I -94 will be either Cuba or Haiti. These individuals are not considered parolees for benefit purposes. ASYLEES: People already in the United States who satisfy the requirements for refugee status because they fear persec ution in their home country can apply for asylum or withholding of deportation. These people do not have refugee status because there is not a well -founded fear of persecution in their home country. People granted asylum may have an I - 94 stamped \"Asylum status granted pursuant to section 208 of the INA\". An asylee may have a written decision from the USCIS or immigratio n judge in addition to an I -94 or I-766. Asylees with an I -766 Employment Authorization Document (EAD) will be coded as A05. NON-IMMIGRANT PEOPLE: Non-immigrants are non -citizens admitted to the United States temporarily for specific purposes and periods of time. USCIS does NOT issue I -94 cards to all non- immigrants. For example, tourists and students might not receive I -94 cards. PEOPLE APPLYING FOR IMMIGRANT STATUS: USCIS does NOT issue I -94 cards to all people applying for immigrant status. Some people are issued a temporary I -551 card. For all other I -94s, the class code stamped on the front of the card indicates what the person's entrance reason is. Use the class code to help determine the person's entrance reason and which assistance programs the person may be eligible for.

See 0017.15.36 (Student Financial Aid Income) . For provisions on verifying other types of income to students, see 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) . MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA, GRH : No provisions. SNAP: Verify student income and/or expenses using: Financial Aid Form (DHS -2646) (PDF) . The client's award letters. Other correspondence from the school. The Financial Aid Form (DHS -2646) (PDF) is sufficient verification of tuition or expenses for the school year. Do not require additional verification unless the student reports a change in tuition or a higher amount of expenses, or the information provided is questionable or inconsistent. See 0010.15 (Verification - Inconsistent Information) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2018 VERIFYING FAMILY VIOLENCE 0010.18.33 For provisions relating to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determination for self -petitioned Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status by battered non- citizens, see 0011.03.21 (Non- Citizens - Victims of Battery/Cruelty) . MFIP, DWP: The provisions apply to verifying domestic abuse relating to the Family Violence Waiver Option. See 0005.12.12.09 (Family Violence Provisions/Referrals) . A client who claims that he/ she is a victim of family violence and wants to claim a Family Violence Waiver must provide documentation of the abuse. Consider any of the following as acceptable verification of family violence: Police, government agency, or court records. Statement from a battered women's shelter staff person or a sexual assault or domestic violence advocate with knowledge of the circumstances. Statement from a professional from whom the client has sought assistance about the abuse. Sworn statement from the participant AND sworn statement from any other person with knowledge of the circumstances. Sworn statement from the participant AND any credible evidence that supports the client's statement. For the definition of a SWORN STATEMENT , see 0002.65 (Glossary: Suitable...) . You must help the client if he/ she has difficulty in securing any of these items. You may also refer the client to a family violence advocate or legal services for help. A client who claims good cause for IV -D and whose claim is approved may use the same documentation to verify family violence. Do NOT require the client to duplicate information already provided to the IV -D worker. See 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non- Compliance--MFIP/DWP) . SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2018 VERIFICATION DUE DATES 0010.21 These procedures do not apply to incomplete report forms received from people subject to scheduled reporting or at recertification . See 0007.12.03 (What MSA, GA, GRH : Allow clients a minimum of 10 days to provide requested verification. Do not close the case on the same day you request the verification. Allow clients the full 10 days to return the verifications, even when the due date occurs after 10- day cutoff, unless the closing reason meets criteria outlined in 0026.12.06 (5 Day Notice) or 0026.12.09 (Adequate Notice) or 0026.12. 18 (Cash Cut -off Notice) or 0026.12.21 (Voluntary Request for Closure Notice) . The 10 day count begins the day after the date the verification is requested. Indicate the due date on the verification request. If a client fails to provide the requested verification by the specified due date, issue a 10- day notice of adverse action. The 10- day verification request period and the 10- day notice of adverse action cannot overlap. When the last day of the 10 -day verification request period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, extend the time period to accept the verification to the next working day. If the client responds to the verification request with enough information to make a determination about continued eligibilit y and/or benefit amount, code the relevant STAT panels, and approve eligibility results. If the client fails to respond to the verification request by the due date, or if their response is incomplete, send a 10- day notice of adverse action to close the case. See TEMP Manual TE19.132 (QTIP #132 10- Day Cutoff/Production Calendar). .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 INCOME AND ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM 0010.24 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: Federal regulations require states to conduct automated data exchanges for applicants and participants of federally funded assistance programs. The Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS) verifies client eligibility and the proper amount of benefits. It also investigates whether clients are getting benefits to which they are not entitled. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Social Security Administration (SSA), and Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) check clients' Social Security numbers with information from their data files. MAXIS uses the information from these agencies to produce IEVS matches telling workers of a possible source of unreported income or assets. MAXIS does not always create IEVS matches, even when there is a discrepancy between information on MAXIS and the data received from match source agencies. To limit the volume of IEVS matches needing worker follow -up, MAXIS uses targeting to produce matches only within a certain dollar amount. See TARGETING in 0002.65 (Glossary: Suitable...) . Targeting identifies the most effective IEVS matches for follow -up. MAXIS produces a message on DAIL/DAIL when an IEVS match occurs. You cannot delete IEVS messages from DAIL. After you enter an action code on the resolution of the IEVS match, the DAIL/DAIL message drops off. If you code non- cooperation as the resolution, the DAIL/DAIL message will not drop off until the effective date of action. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 IEVS MATCH TYPE AND FREQUENCY 0010.24.03 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: The following chart displays how often information is exchanged with match source agencies. The chart lists each type of mat ch and the frequency of matching for applicants and participants. BEER Earnings Monthly Monthly* UNVI IRS Unearned Monthly Annually UBEN DEED Unemployment 2 x Month Monthly WAGE DEED Earnings/Wages 2 x Month Quarterly *Follow ing the initial submittal of a person's record, SSA only provides information when there has been a change in benefit or other circumstances. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 RESOLVING IEVS MATCHES 0010.24.06 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: After the match source agency returns information, MAXIS determines if the person was an applicant or participant during the period the person received the income. Since BEER and UNVI matches cover a full tax year, MAXIS looks at a full 12 months. If the person was an applicant or participant during the period the information covers, MAXIS applies appropriate targeting limi ts. If the dollar amount of the match is at or above the targeting level, MAXIS produces an \"IEVS match\". MAXIS then produces a message on the worker's DAIL/DAIL saying there is an IEVS match which requires follow -up. Take the following steps to process an IEVS match: 1. Review DAIL/DAIL for IEVS messages. IEVS messages state the type of match, the month the match w as produced or the month the information is effective, the person matched, and the person's SSN. The match may not be in the same name as the case name. You may not delete IEVS messages. MAXIS automatically deletes the message when you resolve the IEVS match. See 0010.24 (Income and Eligibility Verification System) . MAXIS also produces \"INFO\" informational messages on BNDX and SDXS/SDXI information available in the INFC function. These are not actual IEVS messages. Delete these messages after you review the information and take appropriate action. 2. Review match information received from the match source agency in the INFC function of MAXIS. On the INFC panel, enter the person's SSN and the match type to review. In the panel footer, enter the month and year that appeared on the IEVS DAIL message. See 0010.24.06.03 (UNVI Match Report Terms) . 3. Review appropriate STAT panels on MAXIS and the cas e record if appropriate, and determine if you already knew the match information: Review all STAT panels for the benefit month the match affects. For UNVI and BEER matches, review each of the 12 benefit months in the tax year. For the participant WAGE run, review each of the 3 benefit months in the quarter the information covers. EXCEPT BNDX and SDXS/SDXI information, verify match information if there is a discrepancy between the match and information in the case record or on MAXIS. Consider BNDX and SDXS/SDXI match information verified upon receipt unless there is reason to dou bt its accuracy. 4. Navigate to the Verification Log Update (IULA/IULB) panels. See 0010.24.15 (Recording IEVS Resolution Findings) . Record the time spent on the IEVS match. If there is no discrepa ncy between the case information and the match informat ion, record the results of the IEVS resolution. If there is a discrepancy in information, initiate an IEVS Difference Notice. See 0026.48 (Notices - IEVS) . If your county agency has written procedures allowing fraud investigators to resolve matches, refer the case to fraud instead of sending the IEVS Difference Notice to the client. In this case, do not consider the match resolved until the fraud i nvestigator completes the investigation, tells you of the results, and you have made an eligibility determination based on the information. See 0010.24.27 (IEVS Fraud) . Do not delay case processing, as long as the client is cooperating and is otherwise eligible. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2001 UNVI MATCH REPORT TERMS 0010.24.06.03 The following terms used on the UNVI match report from the Internal Revenue Service have the meanings listed: ADDITIONAL WINNINGS FROM IDENTICAL WAGER - More than 1 wager on the same item, aggregated to determine if the total amount is more than $1,000.

Federal regulations allow the time frame to be exceeded for these cases. Only the investigations from 20% of the information items statewide from each type of match may exceed the deadline. Take action as soon as you receive the verification. Document all steps you took to resolve the match in CASE/NOTE. Do not take adverse action as long as the client is cooperating fully with your efforts. Resolve all matches by the next recer tification period. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 DETERMINING IEVS EFFECT ON ELIGIBILITY 0010.24.12 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: After you have verified the match information (if match information was not already known), determine its effect on eligibili ty. Update all STAT panels affected by the IEVS match. The IEVS match often covers several months of eligibili ty. You may need to update STAT panels for more than 1 month. Ensure retrospective and prospective budget information is completed on the STAT panels as appropriate. Apply program policy to determine the effect on eligibility. Approve new results on MAXIS as necessary. Establish a claim, if appropriate, using the error source code corresponding to the type of IEVS match that provided the income information. If the fraud unit was not already involved in the match resolution process, refer t he case to t he fraud unit, if appropriate, based on county fraud referral procedures. Record the match resolution information on the Verification Log Update (IULA/IULB) panels. See 0010.24.15 (Recordin g IEVS Resolution Findings) . Record additional background information in CASE/NOTE as appropriate. MSA, GA, GRH: There is no IEVS match for these programs. If you get an IEVS match for a federal program for a client, you must apply that information to determine eligibility and overpayments for any state- funded programs the client receives. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 RECORDING IEVS RESOLUTION FINDINGS 0010.24.15 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: After you investigate and resolve an IEVS match, record the results for each match. You may access the Verification Log Updat e (IULA and IULB panels) from REPT/IEVC, - IEVS information on MAXIS. REPT/IEVW and REPT/IEVC have been merged to form a new panel called IEVC with additional sorts. On IULA, record the number of minutes you spend working on an IEVS match in the are a with the heading \"MMM\". Under the \"ACT\" heading, enter an action code for each federal program matched. Use the code that best reflects how you resolved the match. Complete health insurance information for any match involving earned income. Complete a brief summary of the match resolution findings at the top of the IULB panel. This summary does not replace routine case documentation completed in case notes. The information you enter in the Cost, Savings, and Overpayments sections of IULB is used to complete cost benefit analyses of IEVS matches. DHS uses cost benefit data to help determine targeting limits for IEVS matches. Do not include routine admi nistrative or personnel costs in the Cost section. Include costs incurred when complet ing the verification process that are more than routine administrative or personnel costs, such as bank statements or employment verification. Include as savings any benefits you will not issue due to discovering unreported income through the IEVS matc h. If you knew the information when you determined eligibility, the benefit level would have been lower. Enter the claim number corresponding to the MFIP or SNAP claim if you set up a claim due to the IEVS match. MAXIS completes the rest of t he overpayment section with the type of claim, program, amount, and start and end dates for the claim. Occasionally you may get an IEVS match identical to the match you received 2 weeks or a month before. If the information is identical in every respect and you have already investigated the 1st match, you need to take very little action on the 2nd match: For the 1st match, enter the cost, savings, and overpayment informat ion and the appropriate action code. For the 2nd match, enter action code \"BN\" for \"Already Knew\", and explain that you addressed the IEVS match information in the previous match. Do not enter any cost savings or overpayment information on the 2nd mat ch. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 CLIENT COOPERATION WITH IEVS 0010.24.18 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: People must cooperate with the investigation of the IEVS match. Clients have 10 days to respond to the IEVS Difference Notice. See 0026.48 (Notices - IEVS) . They must provide proof to confirm or refute the match or sign a release of information form for you to request proof. Do not send the IEVS Difference Notice if a fraud investigator is resolving the match. See 0010.24.06 (Resolving IEVS Matche s), 0010.24.27 (IEVS Fraud) . It often takes weeks to get a response to a verification request for some types of income. Do not delay case processing if the client has made a reasonable effort to cooperate. If the client does not respond to the IEVS Difference Notice in 10 days, MAXIS produces a message on the worker's DAIL/DAIL t o close or deny the case and to create a disqualification (DISQ) panel. The DISQ panel will create ineligibility for the person with the IEVS match and the entire unit, unless you enter a code stating the person responded to the IEVS Difference Notice. This disqualification is not time limited. See 0014.03 (Determining t he Assistance Uni t). Record enough information on the circ umstances of the match in case notes to permit pursuing verification of the match upon reapplication. The DISQ panel causes the person to be ineligible. Do not delete the DISQ panel until the person cooperates to resolve the match. The disqualification of 1 unit member due to IEVS non- cooperation makes the entire unit ineligible. If the client cooperates before the effective date of the adverse action for non -cooperation: - Continue with the resolution proc ess. AND - Update the Verification Log Update with the appropriate information and code to replace the non -cooperation code. See 0010.24.15 (Recording IEVS Resolution Findings) . If cooperation occu rs after the effective date of the negative action: - Continue with the verification process. - Do not replace the non -cooperation code in the Verification Log Update with another action code. - Document as appropriate in CASE/NOTE. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL RESPONSIBILITIES 0010.24.21 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has special requirements for safeguarding tax data (for example, the Unverified Unearned Income (UNVI) and Beneficiary Earnings and Exchange Record (BEER) matches). IRS restrictions are much tighter than the Minnesota Data Practices Act. There are federal criminal and civil penalties for the unauthorized inspection and/or disclosure of federal tax data. These penalties are in addition to state law governing private and confidential data. See 0003.09.09 (Client Rights, Private and Confidential Data) . Review the Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State, and Local Agencies (Publication 1075) which has been provided to your agency. The Internal Revenue Service is acutely aware that in fostering our system of taxation the public must have and maintain a high degree of confidence that the personal and financial information furnished to us is protected agains t unauthorized use, inspection or dis closure. Protected data includes the following MAXIS panels: UNVI and UNID panels. BEER and BEED panels. IULA and IULB panels if for UNVI or BEER match. IDLA and IDLB panels if for UNVI or BEER match. It also includes: CASE NOTEs if UNVI, tax record, etc., information is mentioned. Any paper copy of the above. Forms and/or documents referencing the tax record (for example, the Difference Notice). Data may only be used to determine eligibility or the amount of benefits for MFIP, SNAP, and MA. The IRS has instructed DHS that this information, such as a copy of the UNVI panel, cannot be provided to county prosecutors or the court system. Once the data is verified by a 3rd party, the verified information may be used, but not the original IRS tax record itself. Do NOT indicate in discussion of the information that the IRS was the source of the match. Access only the data for the IEVS matches that you are responsible for. Do NOT inspect IRS data for any other cases. Not on ly is it illegal to disclose IRS data, it is also illegal to inspect data you do not need to know to resolve your IEVS matches. Do not copy safeguarded information unless it is absolutely necessary. There are rarely situations in which copies are needed. If protected data is copied: The files containing the data MUST be locked up at night. Do not leave protected data lying around on your desk. Mark files, indicating that they contain protected data. Separate protected data before disposal of files. Maintain a 5 -year record of destruction of federal tax data. The log must include: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 IEVS SAFEGU ARDING RESPONSIBILITIES 0010.24.21 - Who supervised the destruction. - Method of destruction. - Identifying information of the records. - Date of disposal. For mailing (regular mail or courier service), the envelo pe must be double -sealed (1 envelope within another). The 2nd envelope MUST be marked \"Confidential\" with notice that the addressee is the only person who may open it. When completing routine case documentation in CASE NOTE, do not indicate that the source of the match was UNVI, BEER, IRS, or tax records. This eliminates NOTEs from needing safeguarding protection. Personal computers (PCS) MUST be protected: Sign out of MAXIS or lock your PC wh en you leave your desk. Do NOT let anyone use your PC or give anyone your password. Change your password monthly. Do NOT use the same password for access to different systems. Passwords must be at least 6 digits long. The work area where tax data is stored must be secured. Access must be restricted and locked during non- duty hours. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 IEVS NON -DISCLOSURE AND EMPLOYEE AWARENESS 0010.24.24 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: IRS regulations require that all employees with access to federal tax data (for example: UNVI and BEER match information), ar e aware of the special security requirements. There are federal criminal and civil penalties for unauthorized inspection and/or disclosure of this information. There are also state data privacy requirements. See 0003.09.09 (Client Rights, Private and Confidential Data) , 0010.24.21 (IEVS Safeguarding Responsibilities) . Criminal penalties for willful unauthorized INSPECTION: - Fine in any amount not exceeding $1,000, together with the cost of prosecution. OR - Imprisonment of not more that 1 year, together wit h the cost of prosecution. OR - Both. Criminal penalties (felony) for willful unauthorized DISCLOSURE: - Fine in any amount not exceeding $5,000 together with the cost of prosecution. OR - Imprisonment of not more than 5 years together with the cost of prosecution. OR - Both. Civil damages are also possible: - If a person knowingly, or by reason of negligence, inspects or discloses return or return information, unless it results from a good faith, but erroneous, interpretation of the la w. Damages are the greater of: - - $1,000 for each act plus the cost of the action. OR - - The sum of the actual damages, and possible punitive damages plus the cost of the action. NOTE: Disclosure restrictions and penalt ies apply even after emplo yment with your human services agency has ended. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 IEVS FRAUD 0010.24.27 MFIP, DWP, SNAP: Each county agency must have written procedures for referring IEVS matches to the county fraud investigative unit. The procedures must be established through consultation with income maintenance staff and the county attorney's office and/or any other appropriate county law enforcement office. Counties may choose to refer matches to a fraud investigator for assistance in resolving the match. Fraud investigators resolving the IEVS match do not send an IEVS Difference Notice to the client because they are permitted to contact a 3rd party directly without consulting with the client. Fraud investigators resolving the IEVS match must comply w ith other IEVS requirements, including safeguarding and processing matches timely. See 0010.24.09 (Processing IEVS Matches Timely) , 0010.24.21 (IEVS Safeguarding Responsibilities) .

See 0011.24 (Able- Bodied Adults Without Dependents) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION STATUS 0011.03 Citizenship or immigration status affects eligibility. United States citizens are always eligible if they meet other eligibi lity criteria. Eligibility of non- citizens depends on their U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) classification and varies among programs. See 0010.18.11 (Verifying Citizenship and Immigration Status) , 0010.18.12 (Verifying Lawful Temporary Residence) , 0010.18.15 (Verifying Lawful Permanent Residence) , 0010.18.21 (Identify Non- Immigrant or Undocumented Peopl e) to determine citizenship or immigration classification of cli ents. Immigration status can change. Check with participants at appropriate intervals to see if their status has changed. For example: Check 5 years after the date of entry for people who entered after 8 -22-96. Check progress periodically for those required to be in citizenship classes. Check when the citizenship waiting period is over. Check at the ending date for non -citizens who are granted status with an ending date. A status change could possibly mean a change from state to federal benefits or from ineligibility to eligibility. Non- citizens are people present in the United States who have not attained United States citizenship by birth or naturalization. Non- citizens who are lawfully residing in the United States meet the technical requirement for immigration status, but their eligibility for the source of funding for cash and food assistance may be state or federal, depending on immigration status and date of entry. Non- citizens fall into the following broad categories: LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS (LPR) : LPRs are immigrants who have been granted permission to live and work in the United States on a permanent basis. PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION: Includes refugees, people granted asylum or with holding of deportation (or removal), Cuban or Haitian entrants, and Amerasian immigrants from Vietnam. LAWFULLY RESIDING NON -CITIZENS: Includes people with permission to live and work in the United States on a temporary basis, such as people granted parole, temporary protected status (TPS), deferred enforced departure (DED), or other temporary status. NON-IMMIGRANT: People such as tourists, students, business visit ors, and others who have permission to enter the United States for a limited period of time, but have not abandoned their residence in their home country. UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE: People who do not have permission to enter or stay in the United States.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2015 NON-CITIZENS - LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS 0011.03.12 Non-citizens who lawfully immigrated to the United States are called Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs). LPRs have permission to live and work permanently in the United States. They can travel abroad and return to the United States as long as they have not abandoned their United States residence. Permission to enter as an LPR is usually granted to people living abroad, but under certain circumstances it may be granted to a person already present in the United States. See 0011.03.12.03 (Non -Citizens - Adjustment of Status) . An LPR can apply for naturalization to United States citizenship after living in the United States for 5 years (3 years if married to a United States citizen). Most LPRs obtain permission to enter the United States through a petition from a family member. They may be immediate relatives (for example, spouses, minor children, or parents) of adult United States citizens, or receive family -sponsored preference. The number of family -sponsored immigrants has an annual cap, and the waiting list may be several years long. All petitions for family members must also include an affidavit of support. See 0011.03.15 (Non -Citizens - LPR With Sponsors) . People who receive LPR status through marriage to a United States citizen will be granted conditional permanent residence if they have been married less than 2 years. The purpose is so that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) can determine that the reason for the marriage was not for the purpose of gaining entry to the United States. At the end of 2 years, either the couple must file a joint petition with the USCIS to remove the condition, or, to keep his or her LPR status, the non- citizen spouse must qualify for a waiver of joint petition requirement. Conditional permanent residents have the same documents and rights as other LPRs, EXCEPT their I -551 card expires after 2 years and is coded \"CR\". There are also provisions for empl oyment -based immigrants with special skills or abilities, or for jobs in which there is a shortage of workers. Most require a petition from an employer. If the employer is related to the immigrant, an affidavit of support (I-834) may also be required. There are also 55,000 visas per year awarded to people from countries from which few people have been admitted over the previous 5 years. These \"diversity\" visas are awarded on the basis of an annual lottery where names are submitted and random ly drawn. The I -551, passport, or I -94 will identify these non- citizens as DV1, DV2, or DV3. Some LPRs may also have held a previous immigration status, such as refugee or asylee, that may impact eligibility. See 0011.03.12.03 (Non- Citizens - Adjustment of Status) . Consider North American Indians born in Canada who have at least 50% North American Indian blood to be LPRs when they enter the United States from Canada. MFIP, DWP: LPRs are eligible for either federally -funded or state- funded MFIP if they meet all other eligibility criteria. See 0011.03.03 (Non- Citizens - MFIP/DWP Cash) , 0011.03.06 (Non- MFIP Food Portion) for specific information.

See 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration (Non-Citizens - LPR Sponsors) , 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0016.21 Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134) for additional eligibility criteria. LPRs who DO NOT meet the above criteria may be eligible for state- funded food assistance. See 0029.07.03 (State Food Programs) . MSA: People who are not eligible to receive SSI due to non -citizen status are not eligible for MSA. GA: Non-citizens lawfully residing in the United States are eligible. GRH: Follow MSA for aged, blind, and disabled participants. Follow GA for all other adults. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 04/2004 NON-CITIZENS - ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS 0011.03.12.03 Non- citizens already present in the United States who are not lawful permanent residents (LPRs) may apply for adjustment of status to LPR. This process relates to program eligibility in several ways. Only LPRs may become United States citizens. Refugees normally adjust their status 1 year after arrival in the United States. The process is currently completed through a mailed application. If the person has no barrier to admission in the United States, the adjustment is automatic. Asylees may also apply for adjustment 1 year after their asylee status is granted, but there is an annual limit of 10,000 people who may adjust to LPR. Though refugees and asylees may have adjusted to LPR, their eligibility for cash and food assistance programs is still based on their original U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) status. See 0011.03.18 (Non- Citizens - People Fleeing Persecution) . Battered spouses and/or children of United States citizens or LPRs who are non- citizens may be eligible to self -petition for adjustment of status. They may be eligible for assistance while their application is pending. See 0011.03.21 (Non- Citizens - Victims of Battery/Crue lty). Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), non- citizens who had resided unlawfully in the United States since before 1-1- 82 (general amnesty, or section 245A) and certain farmworkers (SAW, or section 210) were allowed to legalize their status through a 3- stage process. Amnesty applicants whose applications were granted were then given lawful temporary resident (LTR) status. The majority of people who legalized under IRCA have become LPRs. However, general amnesty applicants were required to complete English language and United States civics requirements as a condition of adjustment. A few people were unable to complete the requirements and remain LTRs. See 0011.03.24 (Non- Citize ns - Lawfully Residing People) . There were originally program restrictions on those that adjusted under IRCA but those restrictions are no longer in effect. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 NON-CITIZENS - LPR WITH SPONSORS 0011.03.15 Non- citizens may immigrate to the United States through a petition by a sponsor who agreed to support the immigrant as a condition of the immigrant's entry to the United States. Sponsors may be financially responsible for the immigrant. There are 2 types of sponsorship agreements (forms I -134 and I -864). The rules governing how each of these 2 agreements affect the sponsor's income and assets differ depending on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) classification of the non - citizen and/or the type of Affidavit of Support executed by the sponsor. See 0010.18.18 (Verifying Sponsor Information) , 0015.48.03 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsor s W/ I -864), 0015.48.06 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsors W/ I -134), 0016.21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134), 0016.21.03 (Income of Sponsors of LPRs With I -864). The newer Affidavit of Support under Section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Form I -864) used for immediate relative, family based and certain employment based immigrants on 12- 19-97. People sponsoring relatives after that date are required to file this form, which remains in effect until the immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen, earns or can be credit ed with 40 qualifying work quarters, leaves the United States permanently, or dies. See 0010.18.15.06 (Verifying Social Security Credits) , TEMP Manual TE02.12.24 (Social Security Credits). The older Affidavit of Support (Form I -134) was in use prior to 12 -97 and continues to be used for some immigrants who are not sponsored by fa mily members. For all LPRs who arrived on or after 12/19/97, if the I -551 Permanent Resident Card lists any of the codes below, they maybe sponsored under the I -864 Affidavit of Support. Listed below are the most common codes. Submit a question through PolicyQuest if you have a code that is not listed.

LPRs whose sponsors are individuals (rather than agencies or organizations) are eligible if they meet all other eligibility conditions. LPRs whose sponsors are public or private agencies or organizations are ineligible for 3 years f rom the date the L PR enters the United States, unless DHS grants an EXCEPTION. DHS can grant EXCEPTIONS only if the sponsoring agency no longer exists or has become unable to meet the immigrant's needs. There must be a material change in the agency's resources since USCIS approved the application for sponsorship of the immigrant. The non- profit or charitable status of a sponsoring agency is not enough by itself to waive responsibility to support the immigrant.

COMBINED MANUAL I SSUE DATE 03/2020 NON-CITIZENS - PUBLIC CHARGE 0011.03.17 On February 24, 2020, the federal government began implementing the new Public Charge Rule. This rule considers the receipt of some types of public assistance, among other factors, when the federal government reviews the immigration status of certai n non-citizens who apply for legal permanent resident status (a green card) or renew or change their immigration status on or after February 24, 2020. Many of the people we serve may be confused and concerned about whether the public charge rule applies to them . Eligibility workers may receive questions about how the receipt of benefits affects an applicant's or recipient's immigration status. Pl ease note: The public charge rule does NOT change who is or is not eligible for public assistance. Eligibility wo rkers should not consider the public charge rule when making an eligibility determination. Eligibility workers should never give immigration advice or guidance. People who have questions about how the public charge rule affects them or their family should seek legal advice from an immigration attorney. This will allow people to make an informed decision about receiving benefits and understand whether they or their family may be impacted in the future. Inform people who ask about the public charge rule to contact a Legal Aid office at 1- 800-292-4150 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday - Friday ( https://www.lawhelpmn.org/ ) or a private immigration attorney. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2020 NON-CITIZENS - PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION 0011.03.18 In United States immigration law, there are defined statuses granted to people based on humanitarian protection from persecut ion in their home countries. There are several immigration statuses that fall under the category of people fleeing persecution. People with these statuses may adjust their status to Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) after a period of time in the United States, and have a path to citizenship. People with these statuses are eligible for Federal and State benefits and services to the same extent as a refugee. For a list of types of documentation demonstrating the following statuses, see Documentation Guide for People Fleeing Persecution & Victims of Trafficking . REFUGEE Refug ee status is a form of protection granted to people who meet the definition and criteria of refugee and who are of special humanitarian concern to the United States. To be granted refugee status, people must establish they are unable or unwilling to return home due to persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Refugee status is granted prior to US arrival to those who meet the processing priorities set by the Depa rtment of State and involves a minimum 18- 24 month application, interview, and security vetting process. People with refugee status are eligible for Federal and State benefits and services beginning on their date of U.S. arrival. ASYLEE Asylum status is a form of protection granted to people who are already present in the United States or are seeking admission at a port of entry, who meet the definition and criteria of refugee. To be granted asylum status, people must establish they are unable or unwilling to return home due to persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The process for establishing a claim of asylum before an USCIS asylum offic er or immigratio n judge may take some time, often a year or more. People with asylum status are eligible for Federal and State benefits and services beginning on the date of their asylum grant. NOTE: Asylum applicants (asylum seekers) may be granted employment authorization after their application has been pending for 150 days or more, or when preliminary approval is granted prior to a background check. People with pending asylum applications may be eligible for state-funded benefits prior to their asylum being granted. See 0011.03.24 ( Non- Citizens - Lawfully Residing People ). Some applicants who are not granted asylum may be granted Withholding of Removal (or deportation). IRAQI OR AFGHANI SPECIAL IMMIGRANT Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) are granted to certain Iraqi or Afghani individuals who provided assistance to the U.S. government in Iraq and Afghanistan. SIV's are admitted as lawful permanent residents (LPRs) or adjust to Special Immigrant status after enteri ng the U.S. under another immigration status, such as an asylee or parolee. People with SIV status are eligible for Federal and State benefits and services beginning on their date of U.S. arrival. CUBAN/HAITIAN ENTRANT Cuban/Haitian Entrant status is granted to nationals of Cuba and Haiti who have a current or expired parole, who are in pending removal proceedings, or who have a pending application for asylum. The individual's country of origin/c itizenship must be Cuba or Haiti. People with Cuban/Haitian Entrant status are eligible for Federal and State benefits and services beginning on their date of U.S. arrival. Eligibility is treated the same as refugees. Do not treat as parolees. Cuban/Haitian Entrants with a non-appealable final order of removal are not eligible for federal benefits. They may be eligible for state -funded benefits. See 0011.03.24 (Non -Citizens - Lawfully Residing People) . NOTE: Haitian nationals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) do not meet the definition of Haitian Entrant. People with TPS may be eligible for state- funded benefits. See 0011.03.24 (Non -Citizens - Lawfully Residing People) .

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will determine the battery and/or cruelty. See 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration Status) . MFIP, DWP, GA: The non- citizen may be eligible once the petition is accepted by USCIS. The bottom section of the Family Violence Referral (DHS- 3323) (PDF) provides space for the county to make a referral to the local legal aid office or the following agency for people in need of legal assistance under this provision: Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota 651-641-1011 (for assistance with immigration matters). SNAP: The non- immigrant may be eligible once permanent residency has been granted, depending on the classification granted. See 0010.18.24 (Verification - I-94 Cards ) , 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration Status) for specific information.

People in these circumstances are considered lawfully residing. Review their status to be sure it has not expired or changed. PAROLE: The United Sta tes Attorney General has authority to parole non -citizens into the United States when it is in the public interest or for humanitarian reasons. Parole is usually granted for a specific time period, but in some instances it may be indefinite. Humanitarian parole is usually for the purpose of medical treatment that is not available in a non- citizen's home country. Parole may also be used while other applications are pending, such as asylum applications. Parole is often used for people from refugee -producing countries when they do not qualify as refugees but have family members already in the United States. NOTE: Parolees from Cuba and Haiti are considered Cuban/Haitian Entrants. Determine program eligibility for Cuban/Haitian entrants the same as eligibility is determined for persons with refugee status. Do not treat Cuban or Haitian entrants as parolees. See 0011.03.18 (Non- Citizens - People Fleeing Persecution) . LAWFUL TEMP ORARY RESIDENT (LTR): Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, certain undocumented non- citizens were allowed to legalize their status, first to Lawful Temporary Resident (LTR), and then to Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). There is no current provision to allow undocumented non- citizens to apply for legalization to LTR. A small number of LTRs were unable to adjust to LPR, mostly because of the English language and civics testing requirements. FAMILY UNITY: A program resulting from problems that arose due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which allowed the spouses and children of people who legalized their status, to remain in the United States. Most Family Unity case s should be pending adjustment to LPR and the numbers should be decreasing. TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS (TPS): Certain coun tries may be designated as temporarily unsafe to return to because of armed conflict or natural disaster. Residents of those countries who are present in the United States at that time may apply for TPS. TPS is granted for a specified time (6 to 18 months). At the end of the specified time period, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will conduct a review to determine if it is safe for the people to return or if TPS should be extended. PEOPLE WITH PENDING IMMIGRATION STATUS: Under certain circumstances a person may be considered to be lawfully residing in the United States while his or her application is still being processed. This would specifically include: - The spouse or child of a United States citizen whose visa petition has been approved and who has a pending application for adjustment of status to LPR. - An applicant for asylum or withholding of deportation who has been granted employment authorization. OTHER DISCRETIO NARY CLASSIFICATIONS: There are sever al immigration classifications used to permit non -citizens to remain in the United States for humanitarian or other public policy reasons. These classifications include: - Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). - Defe rred Action , including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) . - Voluntary departure. - Stay of deportation. Inform people who ask about the public charge rule to contact a Legal Aid office at 1- 800-292-4150 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday - Friday , Legal Services Corporation, or a private immigration attorney.

For protocols on reporting non- citizens to USCIS, see 0011.03.27.03 (Protocols for Reporting Undocumented People) . Non- immigrants are people allowed to enter the United States for a specific purpose and for a limited period of time. They maintain a residence in their home country that they have no intention of abandoning. They include tourists, students, and diplomats. MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: Undocumented and non- immigrant people are not eli gible. SNAP: Undocumented and non- immigrant people are not eligible. Other members of the unit may be eligible based on their own immigration or citizenship status. DO NOT assume a person is undocumented because he/ she is unable or unwilling to verify immigration status. Such a person is ineligible, but not necessarily undocumented. Unit members not applying for SNAP (non- applicants) are not required to disclose their immigration status. Their income and assets may be deemed toward the eligible unit members.

These protocols were developed to define the respective responsibilities for DHS and county agencies for gathering information about such non- citizens and sharing information with USCIS. County agencies must report to DHS, information on any person known to be unlawfully present in the United States. This means you will know tha t a non- citizen is not lawfully present in the United States ONLY when the unlawful presence is a finding of fact or conclusion of law that is made as part of a formal determination, subject to administrative review, on a non- citizen's claim for benefits under this program. That finding of unlawful presence must be supported by a determination by USCIS or the Executive Office of Immigration Review, such as a Final Order of Deportation. Do not consider a non- citizen to be known to be unlawfully present in the United States under any other circumstances. A Systematic Alien Verification (SAVE) response showing no service record on a person or an immigration status making the person ineligible for benefits is NOT a finding of fact or conclusion of law that the person is not lawfully present. Do not assume a non- citizen is unlawfully present in the United States if the unit indicates that a unit member is here unlawfully without USCIS verification. DO NOT contact USCIS to verify immigration status unless you have determined that the applicant meets all other program requirements, and the client would be eligible for benefits if the immigration status requirement is met. Client cooperation or authorization is not required for contacting USCIS in the context of SAVE verification. See 0010.18.11.03 (Systematic Alien Verification (SAVE)) . In all other situations, the client must provide a written authorization to contact USCIS. See 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) , 0010.18.01 0011.03.27 (Undocumented and Non- Immigrant Peopl e). When you receive verification from USCIS that a non- citizen is known to be here unlawfully, submit the following information to DHS: Complete name. Address. Case number. A copy of the USCIS verification of any person whom the USCIS has verified is here unlawfully. If the verification is a SAVE response indicating the person is subject to a Final Deportation Order or has a similar status, submit a screen print of the response.

For additional information on documentation demonstrating Victim of Trafficking or derivative status, see Documentation Guide for People Fleeing Persecution & Victims of Trafficking . UNDERSTANDING STATUS Human trafficking is a form of modern- day slavery in which traffickers lure individuals with false promises of employment and a better life. Traffickers often target at -risk populations and vulnerable individuals who are disconnected from stable support networks. Under Federal law, the term \"severe forms of trafficking\" is defined as: Sex trafficking: The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act which is induced by force, fraud, or coercion. Any child under the age of 18 who has been subjected to a commercial sex act is a victim of trafficking regardless of force, fraud, or coercion. Labor trafficking: The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, thr ough the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. United States immigration law defines a certification process for victims of trafficking; certification provides victims with the necessary documentation needed to be eligible for benefits and services so they can rebuild their lives in the United States. To receive certification, victims must: Meet the criteria for certification as a victim of severe form of trafficking. Be willing to assist in the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers or be unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma AND 1 OF THE FOLLOWING: Have made application for a T Visa that has not been denied. The T Visa provides victims with a non- immigrant status for up to 4 years to assist federal authorities in the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases and obtain an Employm ent Authorization Document (EAD). Once a T Visa is granted, a victim can apply for Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status after 3 years . Have received Continued Presence (CP) from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in order to contribute to the prosecution of human traffickers. CP provides victims with temporary immigration status for 1 year to assist federal authorities in the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases, and to obtain an EAD. The federal government may renew CP in 1-year increments. Derivative T Visa Certain immediate family members of trafficking victims may be eligible for Derivative T Visas under the following conditions : Victims under the age of 21: Derivative T Visas are available to the spouse of the victim, minor children, unmarried siblings under the age of 18 on the date the victim's application was filed, and parents. Victims over the age of 21: Derivative T Vi sas are available to the victim's spouse and children. ESTABLISHING ELIGIBILITY COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2019 NON-CITIZENS - TRAFFICKING VICTIMS 0011.03.30 The Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for issuing certification/eligibility/interim assistance letters for victims of trafficking who meet criteria. Once granted, HHS certification/eligibility/interim assistance establishes eligibility for federal and state benefits to the same extent as a refugee. Certification Letters Issued to an adult victim of trafficking who has been granted Continued Presence or a T Visa, or has a pending application for a T Visa. Certification letters do not expire. Eligibility for benefits and services begins on the date of certification listed in the letter. Eligibility Letters Issued to child victims of trafficking (under the age of 18), who do not need to be certified to receive federal and state benefits and services. HHS issues an eligibility letter stating that a child is a victim of a severe form of trafficking and is eligible for benefits and services. Eligibility Letters do not expire. Eligibility for benefits and services begins on the date of eligibility listed in the letter. Interim Assis tance Letters Issued to children who may be victims of trafficking while OTIP determines whether the child is a victim of a severe form of trafficking. An interim assistance letter establishes eligibility for federal and state programs and services. Interim Assistance Letters expire after 90 days, and are extendable for an additional 30 days while this determination is in process. Eligibili ty for benefits and services begins on the interim assistance start date listed in the letter. Derivative T -Visa Issued to certain immediate family members of trafficking victims. Persons with derivative T status do not receive, and are not required to present , a Certification Letter or Eligibility Letter to demonstrate eligibility for benefits and services . For a family member already in United States when T status is granted, the date of eligibility for benefits and services is t he notice date on the Notice of Action of approval of that individual's Derivative T status. For a family member who enters the United States on the basis of a Derivative T Visa, the date of eligibility for benefits and services is the date of US arrival. When establishing benefit eligibility for victims of trafficking: Do not require proof of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) documentation. Accept HHS certification letters for adult victims and eligibility or interim assistance letters for victims under age 18 as proof of status for conferring eligibility for benefits. Retain a photo copy in the case file and return the original copy to the applicant. The HHS letters contain a toll -free trafficking verification telephone number. You must call the Trafficking Victim Verification Line at 1- 866-401-5 510 to verify the validity of a claim before providing benefits to the applicant, and to notify ORR of the type of benefits for which the applicant is applying. The HHS letters contains a certification, eligibility or interim assistance date. Use this date as the person's \"entry date\" for purposes of benefit eligibility. If an Interim Assistance Letter expires prior to determination of eligibility as a victim of trafficking, do not automatically close the case. Call the trafficking verification line at 1-866-401-5510 to verify ongoing eligibility for benefits and services. Trafficking victims may not yet possess standard identity documents, such as driver's licenses and social security cards. Do not delay or deny the application because of lack of identity documents. The HHS letter and HHS phone verification satisfy identity and status eligibility. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2019 NON-CITIZENS - TRAFFICKING VICTIMS 0011.03.30 You must assist trafficking victims who do not yet have or are unable to obtain Social Security numbers for work purposes to obtain non- work Social S ecurity numbers. Do not contact the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system to confirm eligibility for benefits for traff icking victims. SAVE does not contain information about trafficking victims.

When a unit applies in Minnesota, and another state has issued SNAP for that month, but the unit says it did not get the SNAP benefits issued by the other state: If no members of the unit remain in the other state, and the case is NOT EXPEDITED, check with the other state to see when and if the SNAP case has been closed. If the case IS EXPEDITED, try t o confirm non- receipt with the other state, but do not delay issuing SNAP pending receipt of information. Issue SNAP based on the unit's written statement that they did not get their benefits in the other state, and that they understand the penalty for fraud. If you find out later that a client actually did get SNAP in more than 1 state or county, the state or county which issued SNAP later must set up a claim. See 0025 (Benefit Adjustments and Recovery) . If some of the previous unit members remain in the other state, DO NOT issue SNAP to the members who moved to Minnesota. People now in the unit who were not in the unit in the other state may be eligible. When confirmation is received that the SNAP has been closed in the previous state, SNAP may be approved in Minnesota, if all other eligibility factors have been met. For a list of other state s' SNAP contacts, see the National Directory of Contacts located on the MAXIS SIR web site under the SNAP Resource Page. MSA: People may not receive MSA from more than 1 county in a month. GA: People are not eligible for GA if they are eligible for a federally -funded cash assistance program. This includes people receiving SSI, receiving or eligible for MFIP, or receiving EA for current maintenance needs. This prohibition applies only if the federal program is currently funded so the people, if eligible, can receive benefits from it. GRH: People may not receive GRH from more than 1 county in a month. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 04/2020 ABLE-BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT DEPENDENTS 0011.24 MFIP, DWP, MSA, provisions. SNAP: Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) are applicants/recipients meeting all of the following: Are age 18 -49. Are not e xempt from Work Registration. See 0028.06.12 (Who Is Exempt From SNAP Work Registration) . Are not e xempt from SNAP E&T. See 0028.06.10 (Who I s Exempt from SNAP E&T) . ABAWDs are eligible for 3 months in any 36-month period and may be time- limited. The 3 months are subject to the following provisions: The 3 -month limit applies only to ABAWDs receiving SNAP. The 3 months do not have to be consecutive. Pro-rated months do not count against this time limit. ABAWD counted months used in another state count towards the time limit in Minnesota. This needs to be verified by contacting the other state. ABAWDs are exempt from the 3- month time limit if they are medically certified as pregnant. See 0010.18.02 (Mandatory Verifications - SNAP) for more information about the verification requirements for this exemption. In addition, ABAWDs are not subject to the work and time limits if they live in a county or on an I ndian reservation where all participants are waived from ABAWD provisions. See TEMP Manual TE02.05.68 (ABAWD SNAP E&T Waived Reservations), TE02.05.69 (ABAWD SNAP E&T Waived Counties). If a client meets a Work Registration exemption, SNAP E&T exemption or any of the ways to not have months count towards the time limit for part of the month, the entire month does not count against the 3- month limit. Minnesota uses a rolling clock to measure the 36 -month period. The 36- month rolling clock begins with the month benefits are being determined for and looks back an additional 35 months. The 36-month look back period continues to roll each month thereafter, even during times the person does not receive SNAP or is exempt from the time limit. You must explain t hese provisions to ABAWDs during the intake and eligibility determination process. Do not count a month against the time limit if the ABAWD participates in work or work related activities 20 hours per week, averaged 80 hours per month. Countable work or work program activities are: Working, including paid employment, self -employment, in -kind, and unpaid work. This includes use of accrued sick or vacation time, if available. Participating in Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) services e qual to or more than the ABAWD work requirement of 20 hours/week, averaged 80 hours/month. Participating in Trade Adjustment Act (TAA) services equal to or more than the ABAWD work requirement of 20 hours/week, averaged 80 hours/month. Participatin g in SNAP E&T activities. NOTE: For an ABAWD, participation in Job Search is not a countable activity unless it makes up less than 50% of the required 80 hours per month, or the ABAWD is co -enrolled in the Workforce Innovation and COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 04/2020 ABLE-BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT DEPENDENTS 0011.24 Opportunity Act (WIOA). See 0028.03.03 (Employment Services/SNAP E&T Required Components) . SNAP recipients subject to the time limit and work provisions can decide if they want to participate in SNAP Employment and Training services to help meet those requirements. Not all counties offer SNAP E&T services. ABAWDs are referred to SNAP E&T when SNAP eligibility is determined or when the participant's exemption from ABAWD provisions ends. However, participation is voluntary. Work and allowable work activities must be verified in order for the month to not count towards the 3- month time limit. If an ABAWD is working with SNAP E&T, the E&T provider can confirm participation in work activities. If the ABAWD is not working wi th SNAP E&T, they must provide verification that they have already completed the activity to not count the month. Once the ABAWD provides verification that they have met the work requirements, uncount the month. If it is determined the client will prospectivel y meet the work requirement, additional verification to uncount future months is not needed. NOTE: When an ABAWD meets work requirements, this is not the same as meeting an exemption. They are still subject to the work requirements and time limits. ABAWDs must report when their work or work related activity hours fall below 20 hours per week, averaged 80 hours per month. This is a reporting requirement for all reporting types. See 0007.03.01 (Monthly Rep orting - Uncle Harry FS) , 0007.03.02 (Six - Month Reporting) . You must retroactively count (or uncount) an ABAWD's month of benefits as 1 of the 3 counted months of SNAP benefits if you later learn that your determination of the ABAWD's exemption status, or whether or not the ABAWD met monthly work requirements, was incorrect. You must make this change in MAXIS. See TE02.05.70 (Coding the WREG Panel for SNAP) for system instructions. As long as the client meets an exemption for some part of the month, he/she is exempt for the entire month. Once an ABAWD uses all 3 counted months during the rolling 36 month period, unless they meet an exemption or a way to regain eligibility listed below, they are ineligible for SNAP. However, their income may still count for the additional unit members receiving SNAP. See 0016.39 (Income of Ineligible Able-Bodied Adults) . EARNING ADDITIONAL MONTHS Able-bodied adults may \"earn\" ADDITIONAL MONTHS of eligibility, or avoid using 1 of their 3 counted months, when they work or participate in work activities an average of 20 hours per week (80 per month). These do not have to be consecutive months. For each month that the person works or participates in work activities at this level, the person \" earns \" a month of SNAP benefits. ABAWD ELIGIBILITY AFTER THE 3 MONTHS - SECOND 3 -MONTH PERIOD If the ABAWD lost eligibility due to using his/her 3 months and has been closed for over 30 days, they will need to re -apply to be eligible for any of the provisions below. An ABAWD who has lost SNAP eligibility by exhausting their initial 3 months out of 36 months may qualify for a second 3 -month period if they have worked or participated in work activities for 80 hours during any 30 consecutive days, as described above under EARNING ADDITIONAL MONTHS. If the person's job or work activity ends, or if the hours are reduced below 80 hours per month, the person qualifies for the second 3-month period of eligibility. This provision does not apply if the person voluntarily quit s the job without good cause. See 0028.30.09 (Refusing or Terminating Employment ). The new 3- month count starts the 1st day of the 1st full month in which SNAP benefits are provided under this second 3 -month eligibility period. A partial month is not a counted month. The second 3- month period runs for 3 consecutive countable months regardless of whether or not the participant receives benefits in all 3 months. This second 3- month period is only available once in any 36- month period. ABAWD ELIGIBILITY - REGAINING ELIGIBILITY An ABAWD who has used up the initial or second 3 months of SNAP eligibility can regain eligibility when during any 30 consecutive days the person has met work or work related activity requirements as described above. The hours must be completed before eligibility can be granted. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 04/2020 ABLE-BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT DEPENDENTS 0011.24 The 30 consecutive days may occur at any time after the ABAWD used the 3 countable months. Once the participant has worked the required number of hours, eligibility can be granted back to the date of application. Once eligibility is granted, eligibility will continue as long as you prospectively anticipate that the person will work the required number of hours for the next month. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 07/1998 CRIMINAL CONVICTION 0011.27 People convicted of a criminal offense or fleeing prosecution may be ineligible for certain programs for a period of time or subject to certain requirements.

The drug test may be conducted by the county agency, or the county agency may be informed of a test failure by a probation officer or other official entity. Apply the following policies to an applicant or participant caregiver who fails a drug test: 1ST OCCURRENCE Vendor pay from the cash portion of the grant for shelter and utilities. Reduce the remaining amount of the unit's Transitio nal Standard by 30%. Issue the balance of the grant (cash and/or food portion) to the unit. If a participant fails a drug test the 1st time and is under a sanction due to other MFIP program requirements, vendor pay from the cash portion of the grant for shelter, and at county option, the utilities. Reduce the remaining grant by 30% and issue the balance to the unit. : Before imposing the above sanction, the job counselor must attempt to meet face- to-face with the caregiver and explain the consequences of failing a subsequent drug test and the right to appeal the sanction. If a face- to-face meeting is not possible, the county must send the adverse action notice and include the information that would have been provided in a face- to-face meeting. Continue to apply the sanctions above until the month after the month the person documents that he/ she has passed a drug test. A caregiver who is sanctioned for failing an initial drug test may cure the 30% sanction by passing a subsequent drug test. 2ND OCCURRENCE: 1. PERMANENTLY disqualify the applicant or participant caregiver from both the cash and food portions of MFIP, and from MFIP Employment Services (MFIP- ES). 2. Remove the needs of the caregiver who failed the drug test from both the ca sh and food portions. Deem to the assistance unit any income of the disqualified caregiver who is living in the home. Caregivers do not lose eligibility for Uncle Harry Food Support, or stand- alone SNAP. Review the case for possible health care eligibility for the disqualified caregiver. Before disqualifying the caregiver and sending a notice of adverse action, the job counselor must attempt to meet face- to-face with the caregiver and identify other resources that may be available to the family and inform the caregiver of his/her appeal rights. If a face- to-face meeting is not possible, counties must provide written information about other local resources that are available to meet the needs of the family. To accomplish this, counties must send a letter (which includes a list of local/county resources) to the affected caregiver at the time MAXIS issues the notice of adverse action. This change will not be programmed in MAXIS. Contact the Transition Supports Systems (TSS) Help Desk for a workaround i f you have a case that fits these criteria.

Minnesota began counting months toward the 60- month lifetime limit 7-1- 97 for receipt of Family GA and Transitional AFDC. The 60- month limit is per caregiver receiving MFIP, and the months do not have to be consecutive. Count or exclude months as noted below. The counted and exempt months include months in which a caregiver received TANF benefits from another state, even if before 7-1- 97 (states may ha ve chosen earlier start dates and shorter limits for their TANF programs). Count months for MFIP cases with a caregiver who has a fraud disqualification beginning on or after 10-1- 07. NOTE: The same banking of months and exception policies that apply to MFIP caregivers also apply to disqualified caregivers. For example, months do not count for either an MFIP caregiver or a disqualified caregiver who is age 60 or older. The following are EXCEPTIONS to counting a month toward the 60- month time limit. If a caregiver meets 1 of the exceptions, that month does NOT COUNT toward the 60- month limit. Months in which the caregiver participated in the MFIP Field Trials, with a random assignment code on the STAT/MEMB panel of E1, E2, R1, C1, or C2.

This applies only to caregivers disqualified effective 10-1- 07 or later. See TEMP Manual TE02.08.169 (MFIP IPV Fraud Disqualification) for information on how to process these cases. Use the STAT/TIME panel in MAXIS to record the history of a caregiver's receipt of assistance toward the 60- month limit. With the exception of caregivers disqualified due to IPV, this tracking triggers MAXIS to mail person- specific notices regarding the limits. The 1st notice is sent to participants in the 48th month of cash assistance. Subsequent notices are sent between the 10th and the 15th of each month after that, telling participants the number of cash assistance months they have left. See TEMP Manu al Contacts - TANF Months ) for other states' TANF effective dates, time limits, and instructions for specific states. When clients move to or from Minnesota: When a client moves to another state, the other state will call to confirm the number of months of assistance rec eived toward the 60- month limit. Provide only the number of TANF -funded months a client has used, unless the other state inquires about state- funded assistance. When a client moves to Minnesota from another state, count only the TANF -funded months on a ssistance toward the 60 - month limit. Do NOT count months when the unit received benefits only from a stat e-funded assistance program. Certain people who have reached their 60- month lifetime limit may be eligible for an EXTENSION OF MFIP under a hardship extension category. See 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensio ns) . During the last 12 months of MFIP there are specific requirements for determining whether a participant is eligible for an extension. See 0011.30.03 (MFIP Transition Period) , 0011.30.06 (180 to 60 Days Before MFIP Closes) . When MFIP is closed at the end of 60 months, you must determine if the family is eligible for other types of assistance, incl uding health care and SNAP. See 0005.09.06 (When Not to Require Completion of an Application) , 0008.06.01 (Implementing Changes - Program Provisions) , and the Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual .

SNAP, MSA , GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2017 MFIP TRANSITION PERIOD 0011.30.03 MFIP: The MFIP transition period begins in the 48th month of receipt of MFIP and continues through the 60th month of MFIP. Follow this process for all participants, even those receiving Family Stabilization Services (FSS). See 0002.23 (Glossary: Fair Hearing...) for the definition of Family Stabilization Services (FSS). The goals of the transition period are: To continue to help famili es find employment. To continue to prepare families for what will happen when they reach their 60th month on MFIP. During the period of 48 to 60 months, DHS identifies MFIP cases and sends notices to each family to notify them of the 60- month time limit and how many months of MFIP they have used. Notices are sent monthly between the 48th and 60th months. See TEMP Manual TE15.06 (MFIP Time Limit Notic es). From 180 to 60 days (approximately 6 to 2 months) before the 60th month: MAXIS identifies these cases and notifies the county. Counties complete an administrative review of each MFIP case prior to a face -to-face meeting. Counties schedule a face -to-face meeting with each family. Face -to-face meetings occur. The order and specific months these activities are undertaken will vary by county. For additional information on steps to follow for the period 180 to 60 days prior to the end of the participant's 60th month, see 0011.30.06 (180 to 60 Days Before MFIP Closes) . No later than 10- day cut -off of the 60th month, make a final decision whether to extend the family's eligibility beyond the 60th month, or close the case. A participant who is in sanction for any reason during the 60th month is not eligible for a hardship extension. In addition, to be eligible for a hardship extension under the \"employed\" hardship extension category, participants must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months. See 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) . If a participant has been in sanction and states that he or she has an illness, but has not provided documentation of the condition, offer to help the participant obtain the needed documentation to cure the sanction. If the participant is still in sanction during the 60th month and a good cause reason does not apply, there is no eligibility for any type of extension. If the participant is not in sanction in the 60th month and does not provide documentation to determine eligibility for an extension category, close the case and reopen it later if the participant provides adequate documentation. Counties and Employment Services Providers should work with participants to clear any sanctions. Notices should be sent by MAXIS, on or before the 10 -day notice cut -off in the 60th month. At the time of the face- to-face meeting, the county should tell the participant whether it appears that the participant would qualify for an extension based on current circumstances, what he/ she must do to qualify, and when the final decision will be made. Months continue to count toward the 60- month time limit while a participant is in the special medical criteria exemption category. See 0011.36 (Special Medical Criteria) . The law requires that the face- to-face meeting be done 180- 60 days before the COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2017 MFIP TRANSITION PERIOD 0011.30.03 participant reaches the end of the 60th counted month. MAXIS will flag these cases for the face- to-face meeting. At the face- to- face meeting, review the family situation to determine if the participant will be eligible for a hardship extension. Also tell the participant how many banked months he/ she has. If information needed to determine if the participant is eligible for a hardship extension is not available before the 10- day cut -off date in the 60th month, make a decision based on the best information available at the time. Depending on the degree of confidence the county has in the documentation it has received, choose either of the following 2 approaches for cases where some further documentation is pending. Document the rationale for choosing a specific approach in case notes. You may EXTEND MFIP benefits for the participant if you have received reasonable documentation that the participan t would qualify for an extension but either the county or another professional has identified that additional follow -up is needed. Set a review of the extension to coincide with the date you expect to receive the additional documentation. Inform the participant that, if the additional documentation does not confirm that the participant is eligible for an extension, he/ she may be responsible for an overpayment. You must CLOSE the case if a participant requests an extension but there is no current docu mentation on file that would indicate that the case is eligible for the extension. Notify the participant that the case may be reinstated if the needed documentat ion is received within 30 days of the date MFIP closes. If you receive the documentation more than 30 days from the closing date, the participant must reapply. You also must offer to help the participant get the needed documentation. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 180 TO 60 DAYS BEFORE MFIP CLOSES 0011.30.06 MFIP: The Department (DHS) recommends that counties take the following steps when setting up and conducting the case review and face- to-face meetings required 180 to 60 days prior to the end of the participant's 60th month on MFIP. 1. COUNTY ADMINISTRATIV E REVIEW Prior to the face- to-face meeting, staff involved with the participant(s) should meet to review the family's situation. DHS recommends using a team for the county administrative review and subsequent face- to-face meeting. The team may include the financial worker, job counselor, supervisory staff, social worker, child care worker, psychologist, vocational specialist, family violence advocate, or anyone else involved with the participant, provided that the participant has signed the necessar y consent forms. Consider the following: Is the participant in the Family Stabilization Services (FSS) service track? If so, does the participant still meet the eligibility criteria and is the documentation used to make the determination still up -to-date? What co nditions exist that affect the participant's progress toward self -sufficiency? Is the participant currently in compliance? What is the sanction history for this case? What services is the family currently receiving? Are there any other service opti ons that should be consid ered, such as subsidized employment? Is the participant's employment plan still appropriate? Does the participant meet an exemption to participation with Employment Services because the household includes a child under 12 months and they have not exhausted the 12- month lifetime limit? Is the participant aware of options for stopping the clock? Is there an extension for which the participant might qualify? What resources might be available to the family if MFIP ends? Has the number of TANF months been correctly counted? NOTE: This list is NOT meant to be all -inclusive. 2. APPOINTMENT LETTER Send a letter to ask the participant to call for an appointment for the face- to-face meeting or to notify the participant that a meeting has been scheduled. If you do not hear from the participant, make AT LEAST 2 more attempts to reach the participant, using other approaches, such as phone calls or home visits. Document these attempts in both case notes and person notes. 3. FACE-TO-FACE M EETING Meet and discuss the items on your county 60-Month Planning Checklist . The county is required to attempt to hold a face- to- face meeting for the benefit of the participant. Although \"attempting to meet face- to-face\" is a requirement for the county, it is not an eligibility requirement for MFIP participants. The face -to-face meetings provide: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 180 TO 60 DAYS BEFORE MFIP CLOSES 0011.30.06 A means to reach participants who may have missed important messages. Information on their sanction status. An opportunity for them to request an extension or develop an exit plan. Stress the importance to the participant of attending the fac e-to-face meeting, but do not sanction the participant for not attending the meeting. 4. IF NO FACE -TO-FACE MEETING If a face- to-face meeting does not occur, send a letter advising the participant that MFIP will soon close. Provide a list of the hards hip extension categories and a copy of the extension request form. Enclose a list of community resources that are available to the participant if MFIP ends and any other information that would have been covered at the face- to-face meeting. If the participant responds to this letter, encourage the participant to come to a face- to-face meeting even if it is after the 58th month. 5. SUPERVISORY OR TEAM REVIEW Before MFIP closes due to the time limit, the job counselor's supervisor or the review team designated by the county must review the case to determine if the criteria for a hardship extension, if requested, were applied appropriately and an attempt was made to meet with the participant face- to-face. If the review indicates that the criteria to close the case were met, send a 10- day notice of adverse action to terminate MFIP at the end of 60th month. If you discover that a case was closed after the 60th month without the required case review, you must contact the participant and offer to do a case review to determine if the assistance unit was eligible for a hardship extension. If the participant is determined to be eligible for a hardship extension and meets all other MFIP eligibility criteria, the county agency must issue retroactive benefits for all months of MFIP eligibility up to and including the current month. For more information, see 0011.30.03 (MFIP Transition Period) , 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions) Parent) , 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) to Illness/Disability) , Extension Category) . DWP, SNAP, MSA, No provisions . COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 MFIP HARDSHIP EXTENSIONS 0011.33 MFIP: Participants who have reached their 60- month lifetime limit as outlined in 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) may be eligible for an extension of MFIP if they meet 1 of the following hardship extension categories: Employed. See 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) . Employed with reduced hours. See 0011.33.03.03 (Limited Work Due to Illness/Disabili ty). Hard to Employ. See 0011.33.06 (MFIP Hard to Employ Extension Category) who are extended as ill or incapacitated or are in any of the hard- to-employ categories are considered Family Stabilization Services (FSS) participants and ARE REQUIRED to develop an FSS employment plan and follow FS S service requirements. EXCEPT for the situations below, participants must request a hardship extension and provide documentation that the criteria f or the extension are met. The request may be verbal or written. The participant does not need to request a hardship extension, orally or in writing, if the participant has already been exte nded and eligibility under the original extension category ends. The participant may have to provide documentation that he or she is eligible under another category. An applicant who has already received 60 months of assistance does not need to request a hardship extension, oral ly or in writing, when re- applying for MFIP. As part of the application process, the applicant will be required to provide documentation that he or she is eligible for a hardship extension. You MUST document whether the participant requests an extension or indicate that he or she was not interested in applying for an extension. To record this process, use the extension form developed by the county to document the request. The form should be completed at the face- to-face meeting, if possible. If the participant does not attend the face- to-face meeting, you must send an extension request form to the participant and tell him/her to notify the county, orally or in writing, if he/she wants to be considered for a hardship extension. Participants may request a hardship extension in any month, but the participant, or both participants in a 2- parent household who reach the 60- month time limit at the same time, must be in compliance with ALL program requirements and NOT in sanction for any reason in the 60th month to be eligible for an extension. Eligibility may begin any time after the 60th month, depending on when the application and verification are received. NOTE: In 2-parent units, there are some instances when 1 parent may be removed from the grant and continue MFIP for the remainder of the unit. See 0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions - Removing 1 Parent) for more information. Work with each unit to determine if the unit is eligible for an extension. For units potentially eligible for an extension as \"ill/incapacitated\" or \"hard to employ\", this may involve identifying potential barriers, referring for assessments, and obtaining documentation. For units potentially eligible for the \"employed\" extension, it may mean helping them increase work hours or making subsidized work opportunities available to them. For units who do not qualify for an extension, it means ensuring that eligible families continue to receive benefits such as food support and health care and directing them to other community resources. In all cases, you must commit to reaching out, following through, and working with each family as intensively as needed. Families also need to follow through on appointments, provide the documentation needed, go to the assessments, and attend scheduled meetings. Be clear with families about your expectations of them. If a participant who applies for an extension after the 60th month is able to document that a sanction was incorrectly applied or that the participant had good cause for the non- compliance, you must consider the participant compliant for the purpose of establishing eligibility for any hardship extension. Considering the participant in compliance under this provision IS an adjustment COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 MFIP HARDSHIP EXTENSIONS 0011.33 of a previous sanction period. DO NOT recalculate benefits or issue supplements. Participants whose MFIP is extended beyond the 60- month limit m ay continue to receive MFIP as long as state law provides for MFIP extensions, the criteria for that extension category continue to be met, and all other MFIP requirements (including ES) continue to be met. When the criteria or requirements are no longer met, either sanction the case or close the case the 1st of the month following the month the criteria no longer exists. If a participant meets FSS eligibility, the FSS sanction provisions must be followed before the participant can be sanctioned. To ensure that the hardship extension policy is consistently applied, DHS recommends that each county develop a written plan for determining eligibility for a hardship extension. The plan should be available to the public upon request. Counties, and Employment Services Providers under contract with the county, must follow the county's limited English proficiency (LEP) plan to communicate information about hardship extensions to participants with limited English proficiency. County staff and Employm ent Services Providers should review their LEP plan to make sure they understand what language assistance resources are available to help participants with LEP understand necessary information about hardship extensions and what they need to do to request an extension. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 MFIP HARDSHIP EXTENSIONS - REMOVING 1 PARENT 0011.33.02 MFIP: When 1 or both parents in a 2- parent family reach the 60- month limit, the unit has the option to remove a caregiver who DOES NOT meet the criteria for an extension from the grant and continue MFIP for the remainder of the unit. In that case, treat t he assistance unit as a 1- parent unit. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . Also see 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions) , 0028.30.04.03 (Post 60- Month Sanctions: 2- Parent Provisions) . The option to remove 1 parent must occur as part of a discussion and decision- making process between the county, the Employment Services Provider, and the participants. The county MUST NOT automatically remove a parent. A parent who is removed from the grant for non- compliance is eligible 1 additional time. A subsequent removal of this parent from the grant for non- compliance will result in permanent disqualification of that parent from MFIP. Only 1 parent may be removed at a time. Removals are counted PER CAREGIVER for purposes of determining permanent disqualification of that caregiver from the MFIP unit. Before removing a non- compliant participant under this policy, you must review the participant's case to determine if the Employment Plan is still appropriate and must make a good faith effort to meet with the participant face- to-face. If the participant does not comply, you must send the participant a notice of adverse action. REMOVING (DISQUALIFYING) 1 PARENT FROM THE GRANT WHEN BOTH PARENTS REACH MONTH 60 AT THE SAME TIME When BOTH parents reach month 60 at the same time and are being evaluated for an extension, 1 parent may be removed from the grant and MFIP continued for the remainder of the unit if 1 of the parents DOES NOT meet the requirements for an extension. Either caregiver may request to remove (disqualify) that parent from the unit effective month 61. If both parents fail to meet the criteria f or an extension, DO NOT extend the MFIP case. If extended as employed, the remaining parent must meet the 30/25 hour Employment Services requirement . Deeming provisions apply. Only 1 parent may be removed from the MFIP unit under this provision. REMOVING (DISQUALIFYING) A CAREGIVER WHEN 1 PARENT REACHES MONTH 60 BEFORE THE OTHER There are 3 instances when 1 parent in a 2- parent unit can be removed from the grant when 1 parent reaches month 60 before the other. EFFECTIVE MONTH 61: If the parent who has reached month 60 does NOT meet the criteria for an extension, either parent may ask to remove (disqualify) the non- compliant parent from the unit. Deeming provisions apply. In this scenario, pre 60- month sanction policies apply to the remaining parent. EFFECTIVE MONTH 61: If the parent who has rea ched month 60 is requesting an extension and is in compliance with MFIP requirements, but the parent who has NOT reached month 60 is NOT in compliance, the non- compliant parent, at either caregiver's request, can be removed (disqualified) effective month 61. This parent may reapply and be removed 1 additional time before he/she is permanently disqualified from MFIP. Pre 60 -month sanction policies apply unless the remaining parent is extended under the employed extension criteria. AFTER MONTH 61: Once extended, if either caregiver is out of compliance with Employment Services requirements, regardless of who has reached month 60 first, either caregiver may request removal of the non- compliant caregiver. Pre 60- month notice requirements apply. Pre 60 -month sanction policies apply unless the remaining parent is extended under the employed extension criteria. The removed caregiver may be added back to the grant 1 additional time before being permanently disqualified from MFIP. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 MFIP EMPLOYED EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.03 MFIP: See 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) for an explanation of the 60- month lifetime limit and exceptions. See 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions) for general information and requirements for hardship extensions. Also see 0011.33.03.03 (Limited Work Due to Illness/Disability) , 0011.33.06 (MFIP Ill/Incapacitated Extension Category) . To be eligible for the \"employed\" extension category, the participant(s) must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months immediately preceding the participant's 61st month, and meet ALL the following conditions. Only consider the months that the participant actually received MFIP (cash OR food portion): 1-PARENT UNITS The participant must be in compliance with all progra m requirements in the 60th month. Being in compliance means the participant is not in sanction for non- cooperation with ANY MFIP program requirement, including non- cooperation with child support. AND The participant must participate in work activities a t least 30 hours per week per month, 25 of which on average must be employment. Participants must meet minimum work requirements, and they are NOT exempt from ES requirements. When the participant has accepted a job that begins during the 60th or 61st month, there must be a reasonable expectation that the participant will work an average of 30 hours per week (or 25 hours of work plus 5 hours of another work activity) in the upcoming month. DHS recommends that the decision be based on the participant's current employment situation and/or employment offer. 2-PARENT UNITS The participant(s) must be in compliance with all program requirements in the 60th month. If BOTH parents reach month 60 at the same time, they both MUST be in compliance in the 60th month. If 1 or both parent(s) are not in compliance in month 60, the unit is not eligible for an extension. Being in compliance means the participant(s) is not in sanction for non- cooperation with ANY MFIP program requirement, including non -cooperation with child support. - When both parents reach month 60 at the same ti me, both parents must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months. If 1 parent does not meet this requirement, the unit has the option to remove (disqualify) that caregiver and extend the remainder of the unit under the employed category. Deem the disqualified caregiver's income to the MFIP unit members. The remaining caregiver in the unit must participate in at least 30 hours of work activities per week, of which an average of at least 25 each week must be employment. See 0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions Removing 1 Parent) . - When only 1 parent in a 2 -parent unit has reached month 60, only that parent must be in compliance 10 out of the last 12 months. If the parent who reaches month 60 does not meet criteria for an extension he/she may be removed. The case then follows pre- 60 month policies. Deem the disqualified caregiver's income to the MFIP unit members. The remaining caregiver in the unit who has not reached month 60 does not need to meet extension criteria until he/she reaches month 60. See 0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions Removing 1 Parent) . - When only 1 parent qualifies for the employed extension and the other parent is ext ended in another category, the employed parent must be participating in at least 30 hours of work activities per week, of which an average of at least 25 each week must be employment. The participants must participate in work activities at least 55 ho urs per week per month, 45 of which on average must be employment. Hours may be divided between the 2 parents in any way that works for that unit's particular situation and should be documented in the Employment Plan. These participants must meet minimum work requirements, and they are NOT exempt from ES requirements. When a participant in a 2 -parent unit has accepted a job that begins during the 60th or 61st month, there must be a COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 MFIP EMPLOYED EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.03 reasonable expectation that the participants will work an average of 55 h ours per week (or 45 hours of work plus 10 hours of another work activity) in the upcoming month. DHS recommends that the decision be based on the participant's current employment situation and/or employment offer. In some instances 2- parent units failing to comply with Employment Services requirements, and thus facing a disqualification from MFIP, may have the option to remove the non- compliant caregiver from the grant and continue MFIP for the remainder of the unit. See 0011.33.02 (MFIP Hardship Extensions Removing 1 Parent) for more information. NOTE: In 2-parent families where only 1 parent is post -60 month status and the 2nd parent is pre- 60 month status, follow the single parent minimum hourly requirements for each parent . LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT If the loss of employment is involuntary (for example, layoffs including seasonal work) the participant is not subject to the hourly employment requirement for 1 month (30 days), but must meet all remaining requirements in the participant's Employment Plan. In cases where participants claim an involuntary loss of employment that is not documented, have them sign a statement that t hey are unemployed through no fault of their own. Counties and ES providers have flexibility to do as much verification as they deem necessary. Falsifying the statement will result in a sanction. Begin the post -60 month sanction process when: The loss of employment is voluntary. OR The loss of employment is involuntary and after 30 days from the last date of employment the participant fails to meet the hourly requirement. The 1- month exemption provision is available to a 1- parent assistance unit twice (separate incidents) in a 12 -month period. The 1-month exemption provision is available to a 2- parent assistance unit twice per parent in a 12- month period. If a participant has been in sanction for 3 or more of the 12 months immediately preceding the 61st month and is able to document that the sanction was incorrectly applied or that he/she had good cause for the non -compliance, consider the participant in compliance for the purpose of establishing eligibility for an employed hardship extension. Considering the participant in compliance under this item IS an adjustment of a previous sanction period. However, DO NOT recalculate benefits or issue supplements unless the participant submitted a timely appeal. If a participant is complying with a child protection plan, the number of hours required under that plan counts toward the number of hours of employment required in the employed extension category. For purposes of the employed extension category, employment means: Subsidized private sector or public sector employment, including Grant Diversion. Unsubsidized employment. On-the-job training. Apprenticeship. Work study. OR A combination of any of the bulleted items above. OR Providing child care services to another participant who is working in a community service program, if it is in combination with paid employment. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 MFIP EMPLOYED EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.03 Participants who have verification from their health care provider that the number of hours they may work is limited due to illness or disability may qualify for an MFIP hardship extension as long as they work at least the number of hours specified by the health care provider. See 0011.33.03.03 (Limited Work Due to Illness/D isability) . The child under 12- month ES exemption does not apply under this extension. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 LIMITED WORK DUE TO ILLNESS/DISA BILITY 00 11.33.03.03 MFIP, DWP: Participants who have verification from their health care provider that the number of hours they may work is limited due to i llness or disability may qualify for an MFIP hardship extension as long as they work at least the number of hours specified by the health care provider. This means that someone with a disability who is only able to work 20 hours a week, rather than the 25 hours that is required to qualify for the employed hardship extension, may be extended if they work an average of 20 hours per week. This extension category is a subset of the employed extension category. All of the criteria and other Employment Services requirements for the \"employed\" extension category apply to this category. See 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) . Counties may develop a form for health care providers to use to document a participant's diagnosis and any functional limitat ions that limit work hours, or may use Request for Medical Opinion (DHS- 2114) (PDF) . If using the DHS -2114 form, include a \"Yes/No\" question that asks whether the participant is following the treatment recommended by the health care provider. Participants who are extended under this subcategory are required to follow the treatment recommendations of the health care provider that provides this documentation. When a participant is part of a 2- parent assistance unit, the other parent must be treated as a 1- parent assistance unit for purposes of meeting the employed category work requirements. See 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) . For information on voluntary and involuntary loss of employment, see 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) . SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 MFIP HARD TO EMPLOY EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.06 MFIP: See 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) for an explanation of the 60- month lifetime limit and exceptions.

Also see 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) , 0011.33.09 (MFIP Ill/Incapacitated Extension Counties may extend MFIP benefits for the hard- to-employ category after 60 months when documentation is not available by the 60th month. Participants must cooperate with efforts to obtain the documentation, and they may be responsible for an overpayment if they are later determined to not qualify for an extension. Also see 0011.30.03 (MFIP Transition Period) . If it appears that their condition would make them eligible for Social Security or other program benefits, require them to apply. See 0012.12 (Applying for Other Benefits) . Participants who are extended in any of the hard to employ categories are considered Family Stabilization Serv ices (FSS) participants and ARE REQUIRED to develop an FSS Employment Plan and follow the FSS service requirements. Participants are subject to post 60- month sanction provisions only after all FSS sanction provisions have been met. See the Employment Services Manual. The following are the \"hard to employ\" extension categories: DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED OR MENTALLY ILL: Participants with mental illness or developmental disabilities are eligible for an extension of their benefits when the condition severely limits the participant's ability to obtain or maintai n suitable employment. NOTE: Consider a partici pant to have met the employment related criteria for this category if the qualified professional determines that the participant's condition prevents him/her from working 20 or more hours per week. The determination of: - Mental illness must be made by a licensed physician or qualified mental health professional. - Developmental Disability must be made by a licensed psychologist, certified school psychologist, or a certified psychometrist working under supervision of a licensed psychologist. See 0011.39 (Qualified Professionals) . LEARNING DISABLED: A participant with a learning disability may be eligible for an extension if the condition severely limits the participant's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. NOTE: Consider a participant to have met the employment related criteria for this category if the qualified professional determines that the participant's condition significantly restricts the range of employment that the person is able to perform; or the condition significantly interferes with the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment for 20 or more hours per week. The determination of a learning disability must be made by a qualified professional. A qualified professional for this purpo se is a licensed psychologist or school psychologi st with experience determining learning disabilities. PARTICIPANTS WITH IQ BELOW 80: Participants with an IQ below 80 may be eligible for an extension of benefits if the y have been assessed by a vocational specialist or qualified professional to determine that the condition severely limits the participant's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. NOTE: Consider a participant to have met the employment related criteria for this category if the qualified professional determines that the participant's condition significantly restricts the range of employment that the person is able to perform; or the condition significantly interferes with the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment for 20 or more hours per week COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 MFIP HARD TO EMPLOY EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.06 The deter mination of IQ must be made by a professional qualified by training and experience to administer the tests necessary to make such a determination (tests of intellectual functioning, assessment of adaptive behavior, adaptive skills, and developmental function). These professionals include a licensed psychologist, certified school psychologists, or certified psychometrists working under supervision of licensed psychologists. UNEMPLOYABLE: Before determining whether an MFIP participant is unemployable, assess whether he/she is eligible for an exemption from the time limit or a hardship extension under other criteria (for example: learning disabled, low IQ, ill or incapacitat ed). Identify the problems as clearly as possible to determine what category and/or plan best meets the participant's needs. If he/she does not meet the criteria for another extension category, but appears to have significant barriers to employment, a determination of the participant's unemployability must be done by a vocational specialist or other qualified professional designated by the county. There is no single factor(s) that would indicate unemployability. See the Employment Services Manual 13.18.12 (Unemployable Extension Criteria) for further details. FAMILY VIOLENCE WAIVER: Participants who are victims of family abuse may be eligible for an extension of benefits. Participants who request this extension must verify the abuse. See 0010.18.33 (Verifying Family Violence) . Participants not already working with a domestic violence advocate MUST work with a job counselor and/or FSS case manager and a person trained in domestic violence to develop an Employment Plan (EP). The primary goal of the EP is to ensure the safety of the caregiver and the children. The job counselor and/or FSS case manager has the final approval of the EP. The EP must be approved prior to the approval of the extension, and participants must comply with activities in their EP to continue receiving the extension. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE D ATE 12/2014 MFIP ILL/INCAPACITATED EXTENSION CATEGORY 0011.33.09 MFIP: See 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) for an explanation of the 60- month lifetime limit and exceptions.

Also see 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) , 0011.33.06 (MFIP Hard to Employ Extension Categor y). Counties may extend MFIP benefits for participants requesting extension under the ill/incapacitated category after 60 months when documentation is not available by the 60th month. Participants must cooperate with efforts to obtain the documentation and they may be responsible for an overpayment if they are later determined to not qualify for an extension. Also see 0011.30.03 (MFIP Transition Period) . Participants with an ill/incapacitated extension are considered Family Stabilization Services (FSS) participants and ARE REQUIRED to develop an FSS Employment Plan and follow FSS requirements. The following are the \"ill or incapacitated\" extension categories: Participants who are ill, injured , or incapacitated may be extended if there is professional certification of an illness, injury, or incapacity that is expected to last more than 30 days which severely limits the participant's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. NOTE: Cons ider a participant to have met the employment related criteria for this category if the qualified professional determines that the participant's condition prevents him/her from working 20 or more hours per week. Participants who are pregnant may be extended under the ill or incapacitated category if there is a medical professional's statement verifying that they are unable to work due to a medical condition, other than pregnancy, and the condition is expected to last for more than 30 days. The extension under ill or incapacitated lasts only as long as the illness or incapacity lasts. Participants in this category are considered Family Stabilization Services participants and must develop an FSS Employment Plan (FSS EP). The FSS EP must include the treatment recommendations of the health care provider certifying the illness, injury, or incapacity. The extension may end for caregivers who do not follow treatment recommendations without good cause. See 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non- Compliance --MFIP/DWP) . Good cause may be granted when the nature of a caregiver's disability interferes with follow through on treatment recommendations. Participants who are needed in the home must provide verification that they are needed to p rovide care for another member of the assistance unit, a relative in the household, or a foster child in the household who has a professionally certified illness o r incapacity that is expected to continue for more than 30 days. The verification of an illness/injury/incapacity must state t hat the participant is needed in the home to provide care, but it does not have to include the extent to which the participant is needed in the home. Participants in this category are considered FSS participants and are not expected to work. Participants with a child or an adult in the household who meets the special medical criteria for home care services or a hom e and community based waiver services program, severe emotional disturbance, or serious and persistent ment al illness. Those meeting the special medical criteria must be receiving or eligible to receive these services or programs. Participants in this category are considered FSS participants and presumed to be unable to work. See 0011.36 (Special Medical Criteria) . If the participant's health care provider cannot or will not provide the information needed to determine if the participant i s eligible for a hardship extension, obtain a release of information from the participant authorizing you to contact the health care provider. Explain to the health care provider that this information is needed to determine if the participant is eligible for a hardshi p extension. If the health care provider still does not respond, contact the consumer representative at the health plan. If the health plan does not respond, contact DHS Health Care Purchasing Division, at 651- 431-2478. Indicate which health plan you have contacted. DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA 0011.36 MFIP: This section describes special medical criteria outlined below that provide for banking months during the 1st 60 months, and extension after reaching the 60- month time limit. See 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) , 0011.33 Cause for Non- Compliance -- MFIP/DWP) . To qualify for the special medical criteria, the child or an adult in the household only needs to meet the criteria; he/she does not need to be receiving services. In a 2- parent household with a child or an adult who meets the special medical criteria, only 1 parent is presumed to be prevented from obtaining or maintaining employment. If the family provides documentation from their health care provider that a 2nd parent is also needed in the home to care for the child or adult who meets the special medical criteria, the 2nd parent may be eligible for a hardship extension under the category for participants whose presence is needed in the home because of the illness or incapacity of another member of the assistance unit. Participants must be evaluated for extension on or before the 60th month. The special medical criteria extension applies onl y when the caregiver has a child or an adult in the household who meet the criteria. When the caregiver receives similar services or has a serious and persistent mental illness, he/she may be extended in another category, such as the ill/incapacitated (lasti ng 30 days or more) category or the hard to employ/MI category. SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA CATEGORIES Participants are considered to have a child or adult in the unit who meets special medical criteria in any of the following categories: HOME CARE SERVICES There is a child or an adult in the household who meets the disability or medical criteria for home care services. For the purpose of this determination, home care services means a medically necessary health service that is ordered by a physician and documented in a service plan that is reviewed by the physician at least once every 60 days for the provision of home health services, or private duty nursing, or at least once every 365 days for personal care. Participants may also reques t services directly from a Home Care Agency, which can contact the physician for the necessary documentation. Home care services are provided at the recipient's residence that is a place other than a hospital or long term care facility. HOME AND COMMUNITY -BASED WAIVER SERVICES There is a child or an adult in the household who meets the disability or medical criteria for a home and community -based waiver services program. Also see the Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual for additional information. These are services not normally covered by MA which are covered under a waiver, including case management, homemaker services, adult day health treatment, habilitation, respite care, and day treatment for individuals with chronic mental illness. The provisions of this criterion apply to the following home and community -based wa iver services programs: Alternative Care Grant Program (ACG) A state -funded program that targets people age 65 or older who are at risk of nursing facility level of care and whose personal financial resources would allow no more than a 6- month stay in a nursing facility. The service menu is the same as that available for people receiving services under the Elderly Waiver Community Access for Disability Inclusion (CADI) Targets people at risk of nursing facility level of care. They must meet ALL of the following: - Be under 65 at the time of assessment. - Be certified disabled by the Social Security Administration or the State Medical Review Team (SMRT). - Be eligible for Medical Assistance. - Be assessed by a Public Health Nurse or Social Worke r as needing the level of medical services provided in a nursing facility. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA 0011.36 Community Alternative Care (CAC) Targets people at risk of long term or frequently recurring hospitalization (initially designed to serve medically fragile children). They must m eet ALL of the following: - Be under 65 at the time of assessment. - Be certified disabled by the Social Security Administration or State Medical Review Team (SMRT). - Be eligible for Medical Assistance. - Have an interdisciplinary team assessment which determines he/she would require frequent or continued hospitalization without waiver services. Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver (TBIW) TBIW targets 2 groups of people: 1. Those at risk of the level of care provided in a neurobehavioral hospital. AND 2. Those at risk of the level of care provided in a specialized nursing facility (designed for people who have cognitive and/or behavioral issues). They must meet ALL of the following - Be under 65 at the time of screening. - Be certified disa bled by the Social Security Administration or the State Medical Review Team (SMRT). - Be eligible for Medical Assistance. Developmental Disabilities (DD) Waiver Targets people who are determined to have DD and are at risk of the level of care provided in an Intermediate Care Facility for people with developmental disabilities (ICF/ DD). They must: - Have developmental disabilities as evidenced by substantial limitations in present functioning manifested by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (generally, full scale IQ score of 70 or less) and commensurate demonstrated deficits of adaptive behavior. These conditions must be manifested before age 22. OR - Require a 24 hour plan of care that involves a general need for a continuous progr am which includes aggressive, consistent implementation of specialized and generic training, treatment and services in the areas of adaptive daily living skills, household management, communication, social skills, community living and responsibility for he alth and safety. OR - Be assessed as eligible on an age appropriate level by an intake worker or case manager. Elderly Waiver (EW) Targets people over the age of 65 who are in a nursing facility or at risk of placement in a nursing facility. Each of the waivers serves both people moving from an institutional setting to the community and people who are determined to be \"at risk of\" the level of care provided in the respective institutional setting. CADI, TBIW, and CAC recipients may remain on the waiv er after age 65 if warranted by their needs and service plan. SEVERE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE (SED) There is a child or children in the household who meet the following definition of \"severe emotional disturbance\" as determined by a qualified professional such that he/she: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA 0011.36 - Has been admitted within the last 3 years or is at risk of being admitted to inpatient or residential treatment. OR - Is a Minnesota resident receiving inpatient treatment or residential treatment for the emotional disturbance through the interstate compact. OR - Has been determined by a me ntal health professional to have psychosis or clinical depression, to be at risk of harming self or others, or to have psychopathological symptoms that resulted from physical or sexual abuse or psychic trauma within the past year. OR - Has significantly impaired home, school, or community functioning for at least 1 year or for a period that a mental health professional documents as presenting substantial risk of lasting at least a year. SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS (SPMI) There is an adult or adults who meet the definition of \"serious and persistent mental illness\" as determined by a qualified professional such that he/she: - Has undergone 2 or more episodes of inpatient care for a mental illness within the preceding 24 months. OR - Cont inuously experienced a psychiatric hospitalization or residential treatment exceeding 6 months' duration within the preceding 12 months. OR - Has been treated by a crisis team 2 or more times within the preceding 24 months. OR - Has a diagnosis of sc hizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, or borderline personality disorder which significantly impairs functioning; and a mental health professional documents that he/she is reasonably likely to have future episodes requiring inpatient or residential treatment unless ongoing case management or community support services are provided. OR - Has been court -committed as a mentally ill person in the past 3 years or has had the commitment stayed or continued. OR - Meets any of the criteria above bu t the specified time period has expired. OR - Was diagnosed with severe emotional disturbance as a child and who a mental health professional has documented in the past 3 years is reasonably likely to have future episodes requiring inpatient or residential treatment unless ongoing case management or community support services are provided. BANKED MONTHS If a participant who has accrued time beginning 1-1- 98 while exempt from Employment Services under the special medical criteria exemption reaches the time limit and is no longer eligible for the special medical criteria extension, the participant must use the banked months before applying for a different type of extension. A caregiver may accrue months back to 1-1- 98 if someone in the household met special medical criteria. Review caregivers who might be retroactively eligible for this exemption so that accrued months can be allowed correctly. See BANKED MONTHS in 0002.05 (Glossary: Assistance Standard. ..) . Participants are subject to regular Employment Services requirements and pre 60 month sanction policies while using banked months. If there is information known to the county or employment services provider that the participant may meet one of the other Family Stabilization Services (FSS) eligibility criteria then FSS sanction provisions must be followed prior to imposing a sanction. See Employment Services Manual Appendix H (FSS Sanction Guidance). After the banked months have been exhausted, evaluate the caregiver to see if there is eligibility for an extension under another extension category. MAXIS is unable to differentiate between extensions for the purpose of drawing on the banked months. Therefore, to ensure the system pulls the banked months before the participant is extended under a different category, code the STAT/TIME panel \"Extension\" field \"NO\" (no extension identified) when the participant no longer qualifies for the special medical criteria extension, even if the participant meets the criteria for a different type of extension. Banked months are accrued based on the special medical criteria of an adult or child in the household, NOT based on a caregiver's own special medical criteria. If a caregiver meets any of the special medical criteria on his or her own, he/she may be COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SPECIAL MEDICAL CRITERIA 0011.36 extended under the ill/incapacitated category, for example, but would not accrue banked months. As long as someone in the household meets the special medical criteria he/she will accrue months to be used after reaching the 60-month time limit and no longer be eligible for a special medical criteria extension. Participating in Employment Services or working does not affect the participant's eligibility for banked months or an extension. Some participants who have been exempt from Employment Services (ES) because they were needed in the home due to the illness or incapacity of another assistance unit member, a relative who lived in the same household, or foster child may be able to accrue time back to 1-1- 98 if they met the special medical criteria for an ES exemption during that same period. No later than the time of the face- to-face interview, explain to any participant with a code of \"8\" (member is required at home to care for an ill or incapacitated family member) on the \"ES Status\" field of the STAT/EMPS panel that time can be accrued if he/she can document that the special medical criteria were met for 1 or more months beginning January 1998. If an ES exemption for a person needed in the home was not approved for the participant but it can be documented that he/she should have been exempt, this policy may also b e applied. The participant can authorize the county agency to help document the special medical criteria during this period. To track these cases, enter a CASE/NOTE when you discover months that a participant met the special medical criteria exemption between January 1998 and June 2000. The CASE/NOTE should include the months accruing time under the special medical criteria exemption (mm/yy to mm/yy), the household member who met special medical criteria, and the type of documentation provided. Also see TEMP Manual TE13.041 (Special Medical Criteria - MAXIS Coding Tips). DWP: If at any time during the DWP application process or during the 4- month DWP eligibility period, the agency determines that a participant is unlikely to benefit from DWP, convert the participant to MFIP. Participants who are determined by a qualified professional to be needed in the home to care for a child or an adult meeting the Special Medical Criteria are considered to be unlikely to benefit from DWP.

Failure to follow requirements in this section will affect eligibility, benefit amount, or benefit payment method. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 PROVIDING/APPLYING FOR AN SSN 0012.03 Some programs require clients to have or apply to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for Social Security numbers (SSNs) . Clients with more than 1 SSN must provide all of them. Do not delay case processing while waiting for SSA's verification of t he SSN. See 0010.18.03 (Verifying Social Security Numbers) for information on SSN application and the SSA verification. NOTE: Do not require clients to provide their Social Security cards when they provide their SSN. If the client is a non- citizen without current employment authorization, SSA will NOT process an application for a Social Security number. Non- citizens who are admitted for a temporary period of time or while their immigration applications are pending are NOT authorized for employment. They may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for employment authorization. Since they must provide a Social Security number for eligibility determination, the application for employm ent authorization must be required. The application for employment authorization requires a fee to be paid, but the fee may be w aived by USCIS if a client demonstrates inability to pay. See 0014.06 (Who Must Be Excluded From Assistance Unit) , 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0016.03 (Income From Disqualified Unit Members) for additional effects of not providing or applying for an SSN. MFIP, DWP: Clients must have or must apply to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for Social Security numbers (SSNs), EXCEPT for members in the assistance unit who are qualified non- citizens and victims of family violence. See BATTERED NON -CITIZEN in 0002.05 (Glossary: Assistance Standard...) . Also see 0011.03.21 (Non- Citizens - Victims of Battery/Cruelty) . Caregivers or children without either SSNs or pending SSN applications are ineligible. If caregivers refuse to provide or apply for SSNs for the only eligible child in a unit, deny the case. SNAP: Units receiving expedited service can provide or apply for SSNs at application or before their next issuance. Unit members with a good cause reason for not completing an SSN application may receive benefits for 1 month beyond the month of application. Illness, temporary absence, or lack of transportation are not good cause reasons. Help unit members get the necessary verification to complete the SSN application. Allow unit members who complete the SSN application to participate while SSA processes their application. If the unit cannot provide or apply for an SSN for the newborn immediately following the birth, allow the unit to provide the SSN or proof of application for an SSN for the newborn at its next recertification or within 6 months following the month of the bab y's birth, whichever is later. Also see 0010.18.03.03 (Verifying Social Security Numbers - Newborns) . Clients who do not provide or apply for an SSN are ineligible. Their income may be deemed toward the eligible unit members.

In addition, there are special living arrangement requirements for minor caregivers or pregnant women under age 18. EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES REQUIREMENTS Unless exempt, caregivers under age 18 without a high school diploma or GED must attend school. See 0028.12 (Education Requirement s). Counties must allow 18- and 19- year old parents who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent to choose an Employment Plan (EP) with an education option. An education option means the EP includes education requirements (high school or its equivalent). The 60- month clock STOPS for 18- and 19 year old parents who choose this option. Plans that include both secondary school attendance and work fall under this option, see 0017.15.15 (Income of Minor Child/Caregiver Under 20) . Without an education option means the EP includes activities under the regular Employment Services track. The 60- month clock DOES NOT stop for 18- and 19 year old parents who choose this option, see 0017.15.15 (Income of Minor Child/Caregiver Under 20). County and Employment Services staff working with 18- and 19- year old parents should explain the new options and make specific efforts to inform those who are in sanction for not attending school that this may be a way to come into compliance. Refer minor caregivers under age 18 to social services within 30 days of approving MFIP, or to the agency with whom your county has contracted to provide minor caregiver services. The minor caregiver must cooperate in developing and participating in an educational progress assessment and an Employment Plan (EP). See 0028.06.03 (Who Must Participate in Empl. . Emancipated minor parents do not have the option to choose between education and employment. If they DO NOT have a high school diploma or GED they are subject to education requirements. If they HAVE a diploma or GED, they are subject to the regular employment services track. For the definition of emancipated minor, see 0002.19 (Glossary: Early...) . Follow the sanction procedure in 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) for minor caregivers and 18- and 19 year old caregivers who fail to cooperate with education or social service requirements. LIVING ARRANGEMENT REQUIREMENTS Inform minor caregivers or pregnant women under age 18 of living arrangement requirements both orally and in writing. Use th e brochure MFIP For Minor Caregivers (DHS- 3238) (PDF). Advise them of the possible exemptions. Minor caregivers or pregnant women under age 18 are required to live with a parent, legal guardian, other appropri ate adult relative or other caregiver, or in an adult -supervised supportive living arrangement in order to receive MFIP. NOTE: The living arrangement requirements DO NOT apply to emancipated minors. When 2 unmarried minor caregivers live together with their minor child: At least 1 minor caregiver must meet the living arrangement requirement in order for the minor child along with the minor caregiver to receive MFIP. The minor caregiver who does not meet the living arrangement requirement is not eligible for MFIP but may be eligible for Uncle Harry Food Support. If neither minor caregiver meets the living arrangement requirement, there is no MFIP eligibility for the unit. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 REQUIREMENTS FOR CAREGIVERS UNDER 20 0012.06 If BOTH minor caregivers meet the living arrangement requirement, they are both eligible along with the child to receive MFIP. In addition, they must establish paternity by completing the Recognition of Parentage (ROP) or by adjudication. When the 2 min or caregivers live with 1 of the caregiver's parent(s), the minor caregiv er who is not related to the parental household is not eligible for MFIP, unless the county has approved this living arrangement. If the county does not approve t he living arrangement, the unrelated minor caregiver is not eligible for MFIP but may get Unc le Harry Food Support. Also see 0014.03.03 (Determining the Cash Assistance Unit) . If a minor caregiver or pregnant woman under age 18 claims that 1 of the exemptions listed below applies to him/her, assist the minor in obtaining the necessary verifications. Minor caregivers who meet 1 of the following criteria are exempt from the li ving arrangement requirements: The minor caregiver has no living parent, other appropriate adult r elative, or legal g uardian whose whereabouts are known. No living parent, other appropriate adult relative, or legal guardian of the minor parent allows the minor parent to live in his/her home. If a minor parent claims this exemption, refer the case to social services for an evaluation. Use the Referral of Minor Parent to Social Services (DHS- 2882) (PDF) . The minor car egiver has lived apart from his/her own parent or legal guardian for a pe riod of at least 1 year before either the birth of the minor child or the minor parent's application for MFIP. The physical or emotional health or safety of the minor caregiver or minor child would be jeopardized if the minor caregiver and minor child resided in the same residence with the minor caregiver's parent(s), other appropriate adult relative, or legal guardian. If a minor caregiver claims this exemption, use the DHS -2882 to refer the case to Child Protection Services for an evaluation. A new referral is not necessary if one has been made within the last 6 months, unless there has been a significant change in circumstances which justifies a new referral and determination. An adult -supervised supportive living arrangement is not available for the minor caregiver and the minor child in the county in which the minor caregiver currently resides. If such an arrangement becomes available within the county, the minor caregiver and child must reside in that arrangement. If a minor caregiver is not living with a parent or legal guardian due to meeting an exemption in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th bullet above, the minor caregiver must reside, when possible, in an adult -supervised supportive living arrangement. Social services will help the minor caregiver (in consultation with the family of the minor caregiver, when appropriate) locate an appropriate adult supervised supportive living arrangement. When a minor caregiver and minor child live with the minor caregiver's parent, another adult relative, a legal guardian or legal custodian, or in an adult -supervised supportive living arrangement, MFIP must be paid, when possible, in the form of a protective payment on behalf of the minor caregiver and minor child. See 0024.09 (Protective and Vendor Payments) . Re-evaluate the living arrangement at recertification and when there is a change in living arrangement or household composition. The living arrangement requirement applies ONLY through the month of the minor parent's 18th birthday. DWP: Caregivers 18 or 19 years of age WITHOUT a high school diploma or its equivalent who choose to have an Employment Plan WITHOUT an education option, follow MFIP. If only 1 parent in a 2- parent family meets these criteria, the family must participate in DWP. For more information on caregivers under 20, see 0013.05 (DWP Bases of Eligibility) . SNAP, MSA , GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 11/2019 APPLYING FOR OTHER BENEFITS 0012.12 MFIP: Require clients to apply for, accept benefits if eligible, and follow through with appealing any denials from other programs for which they appear eligible if those benefits would reduce their MFIP benefit. This includes SSI , RSDI, and Unemployment Insurance. They must apply for benefits within 30 days of being told of their potential eligibility. Deny or terminate eligibility if clients fail to apply without good cause. Good cause for failure to apply for these benefits is allowed when circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or participant prevent the applicant or participant from making an application. Do not require clients to reapply for benefits which had been denied before, unless there has been a change in circumstances or eligibility requirements of that benefit program. When a member of the MFIP unit has been awarded Workers' Compensation, any MFIP received during the period covered by the Workers' Compensation settlement or award is subject to recovery by the DHS Benefit Recove ry Section (BRS). BRS has the authority to recover subsistence related to a workers' compensation injury. An Interim Assistance Agreement (IAA) is not required. DWP: Follow MFIP. Clients applying for SSI and SSDI are considered unlikely to benefit from DWP and should be converted to MFIP. See 0008.06.24 (DWP Conversion or Referral to MFIP) . SNAP: No provisions. MSA, GA, GRH: Require clients to apply for benefits from other programs for which they appear eligible such as RSDI, SSI, Unemployment Insurance, and Veterans benefits. People referred to apply for RSDI and/or SSI should be referred to a Social Security benefits advocacy provider to assist with the application process. See 0012.12.06 (Special Services - Applying for Social Security) . A person may be eligible for SSI and/or RSDI if they have a physical and/or mental impairment (including an emotional or lear ning problem) that will last more than a year , or result in death, and have significant functional impairments that affect their ability to do work activities. See 0029.06.03 (Supplemental Security Income Program) , 0029.06.06 (Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) . The Social Security Administration does not consider chemical dependency a disability. However, some people with chemical dependency might have other physical and/or mental impairments that would qualify. In general, clients must apply for benefits within 30 days of when you notified them about their potential eligibility. Deny or terminate eligibility after 30 days if clients fail to apply without good cause. An individual may receive an extension to the 30- day requirement to apply for other benefits if they have good cause to not apply. A worker will need to enter a MAXIS case note stating good cause was granted. A client has good cause not to apply for other benefits for any reason that is reasonable and justified in the context of surrounding circumstances. Benefits may be approved before a client applies for other maintenance benefits. Clients who do not appear eligible for other benefits should not be referred to apply. Three months prior to the 62nd birthday of a person who has any U.S. work history, require him/her to sign an Interim Assistance Agreement (Non -SSI) (DHS- 1795A) (PDF) and to file for Social Security early retirement benefits. Do not require clients to reapply for benefits which were previously denied unless there has been a change in circumstances o r eligibility requirements of the benefit program. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 11/2019 APPLYING FOR OTHER BENEFITS 0012.12 Refer clients to other programs using the Notice to Apply for Other Maintenance Benefits (DHS -2116) (PDF) . Clients must si gn and date an SSI Interim Assistance Authorization (DHS -1795) (PDF) if being referred to SSI, or an Interim Assistance Agreement (Non -SSI) (DHS- 1795A) (PDF) if being referred to other benefit programs. See 0012.12.03 (Interim Assistance Agreements) . For MSA, deny or terminate people who do not get SSI or RSDI because they have exhausted time- limited benefits. People in this category may apply for GA. The loss of SSI by a non- citizen who has reached the SSI time limit does not prohibit GA eligibility. Do not consider the loss of SSI due to exhausted time-limited benefits to be a failure to meet or comply with Social Secur ity Administration program requirements. Deny or terminate people who are suspended or terminated from RSDI or SSI for failure to meet or comply with Social Security Administration or other program requirements. This includes failure to comply with a required treatment program and failure to get a representative payee. Clients must apply for workers ' compensation benefits to which they may be entitled. When a member of GA or MSA unit has been awarded Workers' Compensation, any GA or MSA received during the period covered by the Workers' Compensation settlement or award is subject to recovery by the DHS Benefit Recovery Section (BRS). BRS has the authority to recover subsistence related to a workers' compensation injury. An interim assistance agreement is not required. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2019 INTERIM ASSISTANCE AGREEMENTS 0012.12.03 MFIP, DWP, SNAP : No provisions. MSA: Follow GA for non-SSI interim assistance. If the client becomes retroactively eligible for SSI, review the case for retroactive MSA eligibility. Consider the following: Only months that GA has been reimbursed thr ough the DHS/SSI interim assistanc e reimbursement (IAR) process (or months for which the county received reimbursement directly from the client) are eligible for MSA. Refer to the DHS Financial Operations MAXIS CASE/NOTE for which months have been reim bursed (see GA above). Issue ret roactive MSA payment(s) based on the client's current MSA basic needs grant. Do not include special need items. A GA reimbursement may remain due from the client for a specific month. This typically happens when coun ties are unable to close GA in time t o prevent an additional GA payment after SSI begins. If this occurs, budget the full SSI benefit rate, without any disregard, plus the GA for that month against the appropriate MSA standard. The difference would be either the amount of GA the client continues to owe or the amount of MSA to be issued to the client. NOTE: GRH payment months are not eligible for retroactive MSA. GA: Require clients to complete an interim assistance agreement (IAA) if their basis of e ligibility is: Permanent illness. Temporary illness. Placement in a facility. Unemployable. Developmental disability /mental illness. RSDI/SSI application/appeal pending. Advanced age. Learning disabled. OR Any time the y apply for other benefits or whenever you expect their benefits to be reinstated after a period of suspension. Clients who are potentially eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) must complete the SSI Interim Assistance Authorization (DHS -1795) (PDF) . Clients who are potentially eligible for other benefits such as RSDI, Workers' Compensation, Veterans benefits, or private insurance (such as short or long-term disability; or auto, business or home liability insurance) must complete the Interim Assistance Agreement (Non-SSI) (DHS-1795A) (PDF) . Clients who are potentially eligible for both SSI and other benefits must sign both a DHS -1795 and a DHS -1795A. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2019 INTERIM ASSISTANCE AGREEMENTS 0012.12.03 Do not approve benefits until the client returns the signed form(s). If, after 30 days , the client does not sign the forms(s), deny benefits. Clients who refuse to sign the DHS-1795 or DHS 1795A are ineligible for GA. Clients must sign a DHS -1795 and/or DHS -1795A at initial application or whenever changes in their circumstances indicate potential eligibility for other benefit s. IAAs remain valid until one of the following occur: Social Secur ity Administration (SSA) approves the SSI and/or RSDI application. SSA denies an application and client does not appeal the decision within 60 days. Client does not apply for other benefits , SSI and/or RSDI within 1 year of signing the form(s). Client and agency agree in writing to end IAA authorization(s). IAA forms are invalid if signed more than 30 days before a Combined Application Form (CAF) or Change Report Form is received. Enter a case note and file IAAs. Inform the client that they have 30 days to complete and return new IAA forms. For more information on coding STAT/PBEN see TEMP Manual TE02.12.14 (Interim Assistance Reimbursement Interface). The agreement allows the state, county , and tribal agencies to seek repayment of benefit s issued while an application for other benefits is pending and then approved. U nless prohibited by federal or state law, seek repayment when clients receive retroactive payments from other programs. The amount of the repayment cannot exceed the amount of benefits issued. People who sign the DHS -1795 for SSI agree to let the Social Security Administration (SSA) reimburse the state for GA and/or GRH received during the period of retroactive SSI eligibility. DHS will mail a notice and explanation to clients and will notify counties via MAXIS CASE/NOTE when clients become eligible for SSI and the state has been reimbursed. Refer any remaining questions regarding SSI interim assistance reimbursements to DHS Financial Operations at 651-431-2427 or 1-888-702-9975. Notify the DHS Benefit Recovery Section (BRS) of clients who sign a DHS -1795A for Workers' Compensation. BRS will seek recovery of benefits paid during the period covered by the W orkers' C ompensation claim. For benefits that clients may receive di rectly, request repayment directly from the client. If the client does not voluntarily repay the benefits issued, begin action to recover it. See 0025 (Benefit Adjustments and Recovery) . When the client's only source of income is RSDI and the client has no other resources, the count y must ask the client to voluntarily repay the interim assistance he/she received. If the client refuses to voluntarily repay the interim assistance, the count y may initiate a civil action to recover the interim assistance. The DHS -1795A includes a statement informing clients that RSDI payments, both retroactive and current, cannot be garnished, attached, executed upon, or levied upon. The form also explains that, although clients cannot be forced to use their RSDI benefits to repay the interim assistance they received, they can voluntarily use their RSDI benefits to repay their state debt. Immediately determine MSA eligibility of any client SSA finds eligible for SSI. GRH: Follow GA, with the following EXCEPTION: If the client becomes retroactively eligible for SSI, review the case for retroactive GRH eligibility. Consider the following: Do not recalculate the client's GRH budget for months that GRH has been reimbursed through the DHS/SSI Interim Assistance Reimbursement (IAR) process or months for which the county received reimbursement directly from the client. If GRH was not reimb ursed through the DHS/SSI Interim Assistance Reimbursement (IAR) process or voluntarily repaid by the client, the GRH budget must be recalculated for the months in which the client received SSI.

Also see the Social Security Advocacy Directory for a list of all contracted DHS agencies throughout the state who assist individuals applying for federal disability pro grams. MFIP, GA, GRH : Advocacy services are available to clients who apply for Social Security benefits . Encourage clients who may have difficulty with the SSI application process and/or for an appeal to accept help from an SSI advocate. Let clients choose their own service provider whether county staff, a DHS Social Security benefits advocate, or their private arrangement. (SSA will now directly compensate attorneys and certain non- attorney advocates from SSI back payments as they do for RSDI claimant s.) County agencies continue to perform other functions in the interim assistance program, including: Screen clients for referral to SSA. Explain the Social Security application process. Explain the benefits available through Social Security . Obtain the client's signature on the SSI Interim Assistance Authorization (DHS -1795) (PDF) and updat e the STAT/PBEN panel. Track the progress of the client's Social Security application. Provide priority response to Social Security and DHS inquiries regarding the claim. Convert the client to MSA and MA and make other benefit adjustments as appropriate when the client becomes eligible for SSI. DHS will tell the cou nty agency of clients who have received GA for 2 years or more for potential Social Security eligibility screening. MAXIS produces a DAIL/DAIL message alerting you to clients you must screen for referral for a Social Security application. In screening potential referrals for a Social Security application, look for clients who: Have an illness, injury or mental condition that will prevent work for 12 months or more or result in death. OR Are not required to pursue Social Security benefits und er their current GA basis of eligibility but may also have another basis of eligibility that does require a Social Security referral. OR Have had a change in circumstances t hat indicates possible Social Security benefits eligibility including having r eceived GA for more than 6 months with little or no change in their condition.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2015 INCAPACITY AND DISABILITY DETERMINATIONS 0012.15 The purposes of determining disability vary by program. Clients may appeal disability determinations . MFIP, DWP: For information on the ill/incapacitated category, 0010.18.05 (Verifying Disability/Incapacity - Cash) . Also see 0028 (Employment Services) for Employment Services requirements on disability determinations . SNAP: Units with permanently disabled clients qualify for special medical deductions, shelter deductions, exclusion from the gross income test, and the choice of certification as separate units. See 0014.03.06 (Determining the SNAP Unit) , 0018.12 (Medical Deductions) , 0018.15 (Shelter Deductions) , 0019.09 (GIT for Separate Elderly Disabled Units) . Clients who do not cooperate with verifying disability cannot use the special deductions, separate household option, or gross income test exclusion. See 0010.18.06 (Verifying Disability/Incapacity - SNAP) . Disability may also affect able- bodied adult status. See 0011.24 (Able- Bodied Adults Without Dependents) .

Normally, use an SSA disability determination. When there is no eligibility for SSA because a disabled client has excess income for SSI and not enough quarters for RSDI, the SMRT makes the disability decision. GA: The county agency should make this determination EXCEPT in cases of undocumented and non- immigrant people who are blind or disabled. In those cases, refer the determination to SMRT. Include current objective medical information describing the applicant's disability.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 11/2018 STATE MEDICAL REVIEW TEAM (SMRT) 0012.15.06 The State Medical Review Team (SMRT) determines disability as required by specific programs. See Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual 2.3.2.2 (MA-ABD Certification of Disabilit y) for more information on specific program requirements. SMRT performs disability determinations for individuals seeking a disabled basis of eligibility for Medical Assistance (MA). A SMRT disability certification establishes a basis of eligibility for MA programs , including home and community -based service (HCBS) waivers, MA under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (MA -TEFRA), and MA for Employed Person with Disabilities (MA -EPD). A SMRT disability certification also gives people access to state funded programs including the Consumer Support Grant (CSG), Family Support Program (FSP), and Special Needs Basic Care (SNBCS). SMRT completes disability determinations for people not certified disabled by SSA. SMRT certifies disability u sing the same disability criteria as the SSA. Referral Process SMRT referrals must be made even if the person has been referred to SSA, because the SSA disability determination process can be long. The county, tribal or state servicing agency completes a SMRT Referral for a Disability Determination and submits it through Integrated Services Delivery System (ISDS). For those who have access to the ISDS system, use the link at the ONEsource Manu al and follow the procedures for submitting a referral under the ISDS Instructions. Expedited Case Criteria SMRT expedites the disability determination process in the following situations where the person is likely to meet disability criteria: The person has a condition that appears on the SSA Compassionate Allowance Listing (CAL) . The person is awaiting discharge from a facility and can be discharged immediately if MA is approved. The person has a potentially life -threatening situation and requires immediate treatment or medication. Other circumstances that may jeopardize a client's benefits. The circumstance is reviewed and accepted on a case by case basis. Continuing Disability Review People certified disabled by SMRT need a continuing disability review every 1 to 7 years. Disability standards are different for children and adults, so at age 18, a child must be evaluated under the adult standards. Newborns certified disabled due to a low - birth weight must be reviewed prior to age 1. Counties may contact SMRT directly at: SMRT Hotline 651- 431-2493 or 1- Email to the SMRT Case emailbox at dhs.smrt@state.mn.u s .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 SMRT - SPECIFIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 0012.15.06.03 See 0012.15.06 (State Medical Review Team (SMRT)) for general provisions. MFIP, DWP, GA : No provisions. SNAP: Do not refer SNAP cases to the State Medical Review Team (SMRT) for disability determinations, but accept a disability determination that SMRT makes for another program. See 0010.18.06 (Verifying Disability/Incapacity - SNAP) . MSA: For cases where there is no eligibility for SSI disability or blindness benefits because of excess income and there is not a current SSA disability determination , send a referral to SMRT. See 0012.15 (Incapacity and Review Team (SMRT)) . GRH: Follow MSA for aged, blind, and disabled participants. Follow GA for all other adults. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 ASSIGNING RIGHTS TO SUPPORT 0012.18 MFIP: Caregivers must assign their rights to child support, spousal maintenance benefits, and child care support to the State of Minnesota. A caregiver assigns all rights of the unit to child support, spousal maintenance benefits, and child care support by signing the Combined Application Form (CAF). Also see 0012.24 ( Child Support Sanctions) . Assignment of child support and spousal maintenance benefits takes effect the date MFIP cash opens. It applies to all support owed at that time and any support owed or received during the period of assignment. It ends with the last day of the month i n which any unit member receives MFIP cash portion. Do NOT make a Child Support Referral for a married parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT The state retains the right to child support owed but not paid during the period of assignment. This is called permanently assigned arrears. The state also has the right to child support not paid before the period of assignment. These are called temporari ly assigned arrears. The state must return these pre- assistance arrears to the caregiver when the caregiver's MFIP cash closes IF the state has not collected them while the caregiver is on cash assistance. After cash portion closes, the state retains a l esser right to those arrears. After cash portion closes, any collections on the temporarily assigned arrears are sent to the caregiver unless the collection method is federal tax intercept. At no time can the state keep collections greater than the amount of the caregiver's lifetime assistance. A unit is ineligible when a caregiver refuses to assign the rights of unit members to child support, spousal maintenance benefits, or child care support. CHILD CARE SUPPORT Child care support assignment takes effect when a family begins to receive child care assistance. Compliance with assignment is a condition of eligibility for families in which both parents of all children in subsidized care do not reside in the home. Assignment takes effect the 1st day of the month following the month the family begins to receive child care assistance. Any child care support received by the family after the effective date should be returned to the county child support agency. Child care support received by parents prior to the assignment effective date will not be recouped. Assignment of child care support remains in effect across all child care assistance programs (MFIP, Transition Year, and Basic Sliding Fee) if the family is continuously eligible for child care assistance and child care assistance is being paid. Child care support is not assigned for a child who is not usi ng subsidized care. DWP: No provisions. DWP participants must cooperate with obtaining support. See 0012.21.03 (Support from Non- Custodial Parents) . Do NOT make a Child Support Referral for a married parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. SNAP: No provisions. MSA: No provisions. MSA participants must comply with MA requirements to maintain automatic eligibility for MA. See the Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual . GA: Pursue child and medical support as another maintenance benefit. Refer units to the Child Support Agency as non- PA cases.

Caregivers must give all pertinent inform ation available to identify, locate, and determine contribution amounts from non- custodial parents. Do NOT make a Child Supp ort Referral for a married parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. A non -custodial parent's refusal to help or provide support does not affect the unit's benefit level or eligibility. S ee 0012.21.03 (Support From Non- Custodial Parents) for information on getting support from non- custodial parents. Also see 0025.30 (Financial Responsibility , People Not in Home) . When notified by IV -D that a caregiver with children has failed to cooperate, begin the sanction process. See 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) . Determine if the participant qualifies for a good cause exemption for non- compliance with child support requirements. Give the participant the Cooperation with Child Support Enforcement (DHS- 2338) (PDF) . Do not sanction the case if the participant claims good cause; he/ she is considered to be cooperating with child support during the period (20 or more days) it takes to verify the good cause claim. See 0012.21.06 (Child Support Good Cause Exemptions) . Non- cooperation with IV -D requirements also results in loss of child care benefits. Notify the Child Care Assistance worker of the non-cooperation if the caregiver is receiving MFIP Child Care Assistance. DWP: Follow MFIP, EXCEPT when notified by IV -D that the caregiver with children is not cooperating, close the case. There are no sanction or vendoring provisions in DWP. SNAP, MSA, GRH: No provisions. GA: Parents of minors continue to have an obligation to provide financial support even if they do not live with them. Request repayment from those parents of benefits paid to the unit. The parent's refusal to cooperate or to contribute does not affect the unit's eligibility. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SUPPORT FROM NON- CUSTODIAL PARENTS 0012.21.03 MFIP: Caregivers with children must help get child and spousal support and child care support (if they receive child care assistanc e) from non- custodial parents. See 0017.15.03 (Child and Spousal Support I ncom e). A caregiver assigns all rights of the unit to child support and spousal maintenance benefits by signing the Combined Application Form (CAF) (DHS -5223) (PDF ). A caregiver assigns all rights of the unit to child care support by completing the Combined Application - Child Care Addendum (DHS- 5223D) (PDF ) in addition to the Combined Application Form ( CAF). See 0012.18 (Assigning Rights to Support) . Failure to help get these kinds of supports results in a sanction or loss of benefits, unless the caregiver with children shows good cause for not cooperating. See 0012.21 (Responsible Relatives Not in the Home) , 0012.21.06 (Child Support Good Cause Exemptions) , 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) . Do NOT make a Child Support Referral for a MARRIED parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. Give the following forms to caregivers and pregnant women at application: Understanding Child Support, a Handbook for Parents (DHS -3393) (PDF) . Referral to Support and Collecti ons (DHS -3163B) (PDF) . Cooperation with Child Support Enforcement (DHS -2338) (PDF) . See 0012.21.06 (Child Support Good Cause Exemptions) . Also give these forms to units when they add a child, if they did not get the forms at application. If the caregiver or pregnant woman fails to complete or return the Referral to Support and Collections (DHS -3163B) (PDF) form, do not treat it as IV -D non- cooperation or as an incomplete application; that is, do not delay or deny the application. The client has met the requirements of assigning rights to support by signing the CAF. In addition, do not automatically sanction or terminate the client's benefits for IV -D non- cooperation. An MFIP sanction may be imposed only when you are notified by IV -D that the client has failed to cooperate. The local Child Support agency is responsible for getting child and spousal support and child care support from non- custodial parents. MAXIS sends MFIP referrals to the Child Support agency (PRISM) automatically after the approval, even if the caregi ver claims good cause. NOTE: For pregnant women who do not have other child(ren) who need to be referred to child support, do the IV -D referral after the child is born. Do not delay or deny MFIP pending an action to get support as long as the caregiver or pregnant woman cooperates. Notify caregivers with children that to cooperate they must: Provide information about non -custodial parents, including name, address, Social Security number, telephone number, place of employment or school, date and place of marriages and divorces, and the names and addresses of relatives. Appear at interview s, hearings, and legal proceedings. Submit to genetic tests including genetic testing of the child, under judicial or administrative order. Get any payments or assets d ue to unit members. Tell the Child Support agency of all case openings, changes, or closings by entering the appropriate data on MAXIS and re-approving MFIP. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 SUPPORT FROM NON- CUSTODIAL PARENTS 0012.21.03 DWP: Follow MFIP with the following EXCEPTIONS: Units on DWP do NOT assign rights to child support and spousal maintenance benefits as indicated in the 2nd paragraph under MFIP above. If the unit receives child care assistance, child care support must be assigned to the state. Child support payments must be paid to the Child Support agency and then forwarded to the DWP family. Count child support and spousal maintenance benefits paid to the custodial parent as unearned income for initial eligibility and when determining the DWP benefit amount. The $25 filing fee charged to a NPA (non -public assistance) custodial parent is waived. SNAP: Count child support payments received by an MFIP caregiver on behalf of a child who is on SNAP only (for example, a child receiving SSI) as income to the ch ild. MSA: No provisions. MSA participants must follow MA requirements to maintain automatic eligibility for MA. See the Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual . GA: See 0012.21 (Responsible Relatives Not in the Home) , 0025.30.03 (Contributions From Parents Not in Home) . GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 CHILD SUPPORT GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS 0012.21.06 MFIP: Caregivers with children must help pursue child and spousal support and child care support (if they receive child care assist ance), unless they have good cause for not cooperating. See 0012.21.03 (Support From Non -Custodial Parents) . Caregivers may claim good cause at any time by completing the Cooperation With Child Support Enforcement (DHS -2338) (PDF) . Good cause is automatically approved upon completion of the (DHS -2338) if a caregiver is a current participant in the Safe at Home (SAH) program. See 0029.29 (Safe At Home Program) . Caregivers with children who do not cooperate with the child support office are subject to sanction. See 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) . Caregivers who are subject to sanction and then claim good cause are eligible while their good cause claim i s pending. Do not impose a sanction unless a claim is denied. INFORMING ABOUT GOOD CAUSE Use the Cooperation With Child Support Enforcement (DHS -2338) (PDF) to tell clients of their right to claim good cause and the procedure for determining if good cause exists. This notice is required at the time of initial application and any time caregivers add children. Recipients of assistance can claim good cause at any time during the receipt of assistance. Put a copy of the signed notice in the case file. Good cause exists when: The caregiver is a current participant in the Safe at Home Program. The mother conceived the child as a result of rape or incest. Legal proceedings for the adoption of the child are pending. The parent is trying to decide whether to keep or give the child up for adoption. The parent must be working with a public o r licensed private social service agency and the decision process cannot exceed 3 m onths. Cooperation will cause physical or emotional harm to the child. Cooperation will cause physical or emotional harm to the child's caregiver, which will reduce the caregiver's ability to adequately care for the child. Physical and emotional harm must be of a serious nature in order to justify a finding of good cause exemption. A finding of good cause exemption based on emotional harm may only be based upon a demonstration of emotional impairment that substantially affects the person's ability to function. A good cause review is required when an MFIP caregiver has been sanctioned at 30% for 6 months. See 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) . When a client files a good cause claim, send a copy of the Cooperation With Child Support Enforcement (DHS -2338) (PDF) to the child support agency. GOOD CAUSE COMMITTEE The Department of Human Services (DHS) requires county agencies to form a county good cause committee with at least 1 representative from the child support enforcement agency. DHS also encourages county agencies to add representatives from the Child Care Assistance program and the Health Care programs, to ensure that each area is represented. The good cause committee uses 7 notices to give all caregivers claiming good cause consistent information about the committee's decision and about their rights and responsibilities. These notices are: Important Information about Your Request for a Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3627) (PDF) . COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 CHILD SUPPORT GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS 0012.21.06 Notice of Denial of Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3628) (PDF) . Notice of Child Support Good Cause Approval (DHS -3629) (PDF) . Notice of Child Support Good Cause Redetermination (DHS -3630) (PDF) . Request to End Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3631) (PDF) . Request for Additional Information to Prove Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3632) (PDF) . Notice of Approv al of Re determination of Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3633) (PDF) . The only change that counties are allowed to make to the above notice text is the letterhead and salutation. In some counties, the assistance program case worker may send these documents instead of the good cause committee. The good cause committee should make decisions within 45 days. Caregivers are given various time frames to respond based on the information requested. Generally, if they have not responded in the time frame given, the good cause committee must deny the good cause claim. If the caregiver requests additional time to submit evidence, the good cause committee should grant the extra time if it appears that the caregiver is cooperating and is trying to obtain the information. Good cause committees must assist caregivers in gathering evidence and pay necessary costs, if requested. WHEN GOOD CAUSE IS CLAIMED If an applicant claims good cause, the good cause committee will contact the caregiver by sending the Important Information about Your Request for a Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3627) (PDF) and the Notice of Privacy Practices (DHS- 3979) (PDF) . The Important Information about Your Request for a Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3627) (PDF) tells the caregiver about the good cause claim process, what kind of evidence is acceptable to prove the claim, and what will happen next. The good cause committee must mail this letter within 5 working days of the good cause committee's receipt of the clai m. The good cause committee will send one letter per good cause claim, or per non -custodial parent (NCP). In some instances when a caregiver has more than one child in common with the NCP, the caregiver may want to claim a good cause exemption for only one child. Complete a separate STAT/ABPS panel for the child named on the good cause claim. The child support office will open a separate case for the child with the good cause claim. The caregiver is asked to provide proof of good cause within 20 days of receipt of the Important Information about Your Request for a Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3627) (PDF) . See 0010 (Verification) , 0010.18.33 (Verifying Family Violence) . Inform the good cause committee if information has already been provided to substantiate a claim of family violence. If the caregiver is a current participant in the Safe at Home program and has the SAH identification card no further proof is required. See 0029.29 (Safe At Home Program) . One type of evidence listed on the Important Information about Your Request for a Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS - 3627) (PDF) that the caregiver can submit is a sworn statement from someone other than the person claiming good cause who can attest to the caregiver's claim. The statement must be notarized. The good cause committee may receive statements that are not notarized. Because state statute does not limit the evidence which can be considered, the good cause committee shoul d use its discretion to determine how to use the statement in combination with other evidence. A caregiver may also submit a statement as evidence, but the caregiver's statement does not have to be notarized. GOOD CAUSE CLAIM ON AN OPEN PROGRAM STOPS ALL ACTION ON NCP CASE The child support agency will not begin activity to pursue support or establish paternity while a good cause claim is pending or when there is an approved good cause claim in place under any open program. When a child support case is already open and active, the child support agency will stop all enforcement actions on the case, including income withholding. A good cause approval or pending request affects the entire child support case for that NCP (child support, child care support, and medical COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 CHILD SUPPORT GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS 0012.21.06 support portions of the order), regardless of what assistance is received by the caregiver. WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO PROVE GOOD CAUSE CLAIM The good cause committee may need more evidence to make a decision on a good cause claim. The good cause committee will send the Request for Additional Information to Prove Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3632) (PDF) to the caregiver, which gives examples of the kinds of additional evidence the caregiver needs to provide. The Notice of Privacy Practices (DHS -3979) (PDF) must be sent with the Request for Additional Information to Prove Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3632) (PDF) . The good cause committee will allow the caregiver an additional 20 days to send in the information. If there is a specific piece or type of evidence the good cause committee wants the caregiver to provide, it is entered on the \"Other\" line under the heading of \"What You Must Provide\". The good cause committee evaluates the claim based on the evidence provided. They investigate good cause claims when the caregiver does not provide sufficient proof but it seems good cause exists. If the investigation will include contacting the NCP, they tell the caregiver before making any contact. Some caregivers may not have additional evidence. For example, if the caregiver has not had contact with the NCP because of a restraining order, there may not be any contact to report. In these situations a written statement from the caregiver or a n otarized statement from someone else is acceptable evidence to help prove that a good cause exemption is appropriate. GOOD CAUSE CLAIM IS APPROVED The good cause committee will send the caregiver the Notice of Child Support Good Cause Approval (DHS -3629) ( PDF) when they determine the caregiver is exempt from the requirement to cooperate with the child support agency. The Notice of Child Support Good Cause Approval (DHS -3629) (PDF) tells the caregiver that the good cause committee has approved the request for good cause exemption, what will happen to the child support case for the child, and that the approval is good for only 1 year . If good cause is approved, the child support agency must review the child support case for closure during the approval period. When the factors that led to the original exemption continue to exist, a good cause exemption must be allowed without additional evidence under succeeding applications and redeterminations during the approval period. In some situations granting a permanent good cause exemption is appropriate. Limit granting a permanent good cause exemption to situations that usually will not change and for which additional evidence is not neces sary or possible. For example, if a good cause exemption were initially granted because the child was conceived as a result of rape or incest, granting a permanent good cause exemption would be appropriate. The good cause committee still must schedule the case for annual review, but it will not send the Notice of Child Support Good Cause Redetermination (DHS -3630) (PDF) . Instead, the good cause committee will send the Notice of Approval of Redetermination of Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3633) (PDF) . This notice reminds the caregiver that good cause is approved for 1 year, and gives information on how to end the good cause exemption if the caregiver now wants child support enforcement services. GOOD CAUSE CLAIM IS DENIED The good cause committee will send the Notice of Denial of Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3628) (PDF) to the caregiver when they decide to deny the good cause claim. A good cause claim can be denied at the time of the original reques t for it or at the time of annual recertification. The denial notice tells the caregiver that the claim is denied and why. It also lists the caregiver's options now that the claim is denied. The options are to: Request a conference with the good cause committee to resolve the issues that led to the denial of the good cause claim. The caregiver must make a request for a conference within 30 days of receiving the notice of denial of child support good cause exemption. The good cause committee schedules this conference and can hold it in person or by phone. T he conference may lead the good cause committee to review the materials again and to make a different decision on the claim. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 CHILD SUPPORT GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS 0012.21.06 Cooperate with pursuing child support and child care support. Incur a sanction for non -cooperation. See 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) . Withdraw the application. REVIEW OF APPROVED GOOD CAUSE CLAIMS The good cause committee must review good cause approvals annually to determine whether the reasons for originally granting good cause exemptions still exist. The good cause committee will send the Notice of Child Support Good Cause Redetermination (DHS -3630) (PDF) and the Notice of Privacy Practices (DHS- 3979) (PDF) to the caregiver at least 30 days before the 1 year redetermination date. The Notice of Child Support Good Cause Redetermination (DHS -3630) (PDF) tells the caregiver that it is time to review the good cause exemption, that additional or new evidence is needed, and what to do if the caregiver does not have additional or new evidence. The good cause committee should include the Request to End Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3631) (PDF) with the Notice of Child Support Good Cause Redetermination (DHS -3630) (PDF) . If a caregiver with a good cause exemption moves to another county within the year, the review date for the good cau se exemption remains 1 year from the date the exemption was approved. The documentation and evidence supporting a good cause claim submitted to a good cause committee may be shared with another good cause committee for the purpose of determining or redete rmining good cause. The good cause committee may review an approval before the 1 year good cause exemption is up if there is reason to believe that the facts that led to the exemption have changed. The good cause redetermination date might not be the same as the MFIP redetermination date. The good cause committee will send the Notice of Approval of Redetermination of Your Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3633) (PDF) when it has approved the good cause exemption for another year. This notice gives the caregiver the date the good cause committee will review the exemption again and tells the caregiver what needs to be done if the caregiver no longer wants to claim a good cause exemption. CAREGIVER REQUESTS TO END GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTION A caregiver may withdraw a claim for good cause at any time during the process or at any time during the approval period, including at the time of the good cause redetermination. Caregivers should request a withdrawal in writing by completing the Request to End Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3631) (PDF) and returning it to the good cause committee or their MFIP w orker. When the good cause committee receives the Request to End Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3631) (PDF) they should forward it to the MFIP worker and the child support office. When the MFIP worker receives the form they must: Notify the child support office through the MAXIS interface by changing the good cause code on the STAT/ABPS panel . They may also forward a copy of the notice to the county child support office. AND Notify the good cause committee that approved the good cause claim. After receiving the Request to End Child Support Good Cause Exemption (DHS -3631) (PDF) , the child support office must enforce an existing support obligation or establish a support obligation as if a good cause exemption never existed. DWP: Follow MFIP. However, the sanction for noncooperation is to close the case. There are no vendoring provisions in DWP. If t he caregiver cooperates, reopen DWP. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 CHILD SUPPORT GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS 0012.21.06 SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2017 CHILD SUPPORT SANCTIONS 0012.24 MFIP: IV-D determines when caregivers with children fail to cooperate with support requirements. When notified by the Child Support agency of non- cooperation, reduce the unit's grant (cash/food portion) by 30% of the unit's Transitional Standard. Act on the reported change as soon as possible but no later than 10 days from the date notified, allowing for 10-day notice. If the 10th day is after 10- day notice cutoff, impose the sanction no later than the next available month allowing for 10- day notice . The residual amount of the grant, if any, must be paid to the caregiver. Non- cooperation with IV -D requirements also results in the loss of child care benefits. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) , 0026 (Notices) . Do not impose a sanction when a caregiver complies with support requirements prior to the effective date of the sanction. If you do impose a sanction, and the caregiver subsequently complies, remove the sanction the month following the month that he/she complies. Caregivers who are not themselves on the MFIP grant are still required to cooperate with Child Support. This applies to parental caregivers who are not receiving MFIP because they receive SSI, are ineligible non- citizens, or are removed from the grant due to fraud, EBT misuse, a drug felony or for any other reason. It also applies to the 2nd parent in a 2- parent household who has chosen the post -60 removal option. Failure to cooperate results in a sanction occurrence against the caregiver and reduces the MFIP grant by 30%, even when the grant is issued for the needs of the child(ren) only. Non- parental caregivers receiving assistance for a child(ren) MUST cooperate with Child Support even if they do not receive assistance for themselves. They must be sanctioned if IV -D determines non- cooperation. Instead of incurring a sanction, a relative caregiver may choose to remove the child(ren) from the unit, unless the child(ren) is req uired to be in the unit. Do not impose a sanction when the Child Support agency reports a caregiver has not cooperated for a child who is no longer receiving MFIP. After a notice of sanction is sent, the caregiver may then claim good cause. Give the participant the Cooperation with Child Support Enforcement (DHS- 2338) (PDF) and send a copy of the signed notice to the child support agency. While the good cause committee is revie wing the claim the caregiver is considered to be cooperating. Do not sanction the case during the period the committee is deciding on the claim. If the claim is denied, the sanction would then be imposed. See 0012.21.06 (Child Support Good Cause Exemptions) . Consider each month that a caregiver with children fails to comply with support requirements as a separate occurrence of non-compliance. Vendor payment rules apply beginning with the 2nd occurrence of child support sanctions. Sanctions count towards closure of the MFIP case. A participant will have his/her case closed at the 7th occurrence of non- compliance. The count toward closure does NOT start over, even if the participant goes off assistance, comes into compliance, and remains in compliance. Use the STAT/SANC panel to track occurrences of non- compliance. FOR THE 1ST OCCURRENCE OF NON -COMPLIANCE: Reduce the family's grant by 30% of the Transitional Standard for the family's size. The grant reduction must be in effect for a minimum of 1 month and must be removed in the month after the month the participant returns to compliance. FOR THE 2ND - 6TH OCCURRENCE OF NON -COMPLIANCE: Vendor pay the shelter costs up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. At county option, you may vendor pay utilities up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. Vendor payment rules apply beginning with the 2nd occurrence of child support sanctions. See 0024.09 (Protective and Vendor Payments) for procedures to use when the information necessary to vendor pay is not on file and the vendor refuses to accept partial payment. Reduce the residual amount of the cash grant after vendor payment, if any, and the food portion by an amount equal to 30% of the Transitional Standard for the family's size. The reduction in the grant must be in effect for a minimum of 1 month and must be removed the month after the month the participant returns to compliance. Continue to vendor pay the shelter (and utilities, if applicable) for 6 months after the month in which the participa nt(s) return to COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 05/2017 CHILD SUPPORT SANCTIONS 0012.24 compliance. FOR THE 7TH OCCURRENCE OF NON -COMPLIANCE: Close the MFIP case (100% sanction). Closure during the first 60 months is NOT permanent. The case must be closed for 1 full month but can be reopened in the month following the month that the caregiver cooperates with the support requirements. A good cause review is required when the MFIP case is sanctioned at 30% for 6 months. The county must attempt to meet face- to-face with the caregiver before case closure. At this face- to-face meeting the county must give the caregiver the Cooperation with Child Support Enforcement (DHS -2338) (PDF) , or send it to the caregiver before closing in the 7th month if a face- to-face meeting does not occur. The caregiver may make a good cause claim even if good cause has previously been denied. If the caregiver claims good cause, send the signed Client Statement of Good Cause form to the good cause committee. The committee must review the good cause claim following normal procedures. While the committee is reviewing the claim, the caregiver is considered to be cooperating. If the claim is denied, then the 7th occurrence sanction would be imposed. See 0012.21.06 (Child Support Good Cause Exemptions) . Do not continue a prior child support sanction for new MFIP applications or for MFIP cases that have been closed for more than 30 days and reapply if a complete application is received. The completed application is considered cooperation with child support. See 0005.12.03 (What is a Complete Application) . Sanction the case at 30% if the case that was closed for non- compliance (100% sanction) is reopened after compliance and has another occurrence of non- compliance. Close the case if there is a subsequent occurrence of non- compliance for a case reopened after closure for non- compliance. NOTE: The sanction policy for non -compliance with child support i s the same for households in the 1st 60 months and for extended households. Closure for non- compliance does NOT make the participant ineligible for SNAP, if otherwise eligible. Determine eligibility for SNAP at the time of closure. Case closure also does not affect health care eligibility. FOR DUAL SANCTIONS: Impose sanctions as follows for participants who refuse to comply with child support requirements AND have a concurrent sanction for failure to attend orientation or to develop or to comply with their Employment Plan: If the child support non -complianc e and other program non -compliance occur in the SAME month, reduce the Transitional Standard and MFIP food portion, whichever applies, by 30% for the 1st month, then vendor pay shelter costs (and utilities, if applicable ) for the 2nd month. The participant remains subject to vendor payments and 30% sanction until BOTH issues of non -compliance have been resolved. DWP: Follow MFIP, EXCEPT when notified by IV- D that the caregiver with children is not cooperating, send a notice of termination and close the case. There are no sanction or vendoring provisions in DWP. The unit may be eligible for DWP again if the unit cooperates. A family unit that has been disqualified from DWP due to non- cooperation will not be eligible for MFIP or any other TANF cash program for the remainder of the 4- month DWP eligibility period. If the family unit that has been closed due to non- cooperation applies for MFIP after the 4- month DWP period ends, the disqualification does not carry over to MFIP. IV -D will determine cooperation or non- cooperation based on the MFIP IV -D referral. SNAP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 CHEMICAL USE ASSESSMENT 0012.30 MFIP, DWP, SNAP, MSA, GRH: No provisions.

The chemical use assessment must be conducted by a qualified county agency staff person or by a designee of the county agency . Review a determination of drug dependency at least every 12 months. There are certain restrictions on payments made after a client has been referred for a chemical use assessment or has been assessed as being drug dependent. See 0024.09.12 (Payments After Chemical Use Assessment) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 BASIS OF ELIGIBILITY 0013 People applying for some programs must have a basis of eligibility for that program. The SNAP Program does not require people to have a basis of eligibility. Some units with SSI recipients and GA participants may be categorically eligible for SNAP. See 0013.06 (SNAP Categorical Eligibility/Ineligibility) . People have a basis of eligibility for assistance if they fit into an eligibility category targeted by a program. In addition to having a basis of eligibility, people must meet all other eligibility requirements in order to receive benefits. Determine if people have a basis of eligibility for each program for which they apply. When people lose 1 basis of eligibili ty, determine if they have another basis of eligibility without requiring them to reapply. See 0007 (Reporting) , 0008.06.03 (Change in Basis of Eligibility) .

If the woman and the acknowledged father live together but are not married, use only the woman's income and assets to determine eligibility and benefits. If the woman and the father live together and are married, use the income and assets of both the mother and father to determi ne eligibility and benefits. The father is also a mandatory unit member. See 0014.03.03 (Determining the Cash Assistance Unit) . Eligibility starts the 1st day of the month in which the pregnancy begins, or on the date of application, whichever is later.

A 2-PARENT FAMILY UNIT MUST PARTICIPATE IN DWP UNLESS THE UNIT MEETS 1 OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS A 2-parent family unit that includes a child under 12 months (with no other DWP exclusion reason) must participate in DWP. One parent may claim the ES exemption for the care of a child under 12 months if, between them, they have not used the entire 12 m onths lifetime ES exemption while previously on MFIP or DWP. OR Each parent meets 1 of the exception criteria in 3 through 6. OR 1 or both parents meet 1 of the exception criteria in 7 through 12. Determine eligibility for MFIP for any applicant unit that meets the criteria in 1 through 12. When a new caregiver who meets 1 of the criteria in items 6 through 12 joins the unit, convert the case to MFIP. See 0008.06.24 (DWP Conversion or Referral to MFIP) . NOTE: Unless a unit meets criteria to be converted to MFIP, a unit is ineligible for MFIP any month of the 4 -month DWP period. DWP participants must meet the 30- day residency requirement (or qualify for a hardship exception) before issuing any benefits. See 0011.06.09 (State Residence - 30-Day Requirement) . Eligibility for DWP is limited to 4 consecutive months in a 12- month period. The 4- month DWP period is a fixed period of time. I t includes the initial month of eligibility (which may be a partial month because the initial month's benefits are prorated based on the date of application) plus the following 3 calendar months. The 4- month DWP period is not affected by a break in receipt of benefits for any reason. If a participant leaves DWP and reapplies for cash within the consecutive 4- month period, whether in the same county or a different county, determine eligibility for DWP. If the person reapplies after the DWP consecutive 4-m onth period but within the 12-month period of ineligibility for DWP, the unit is eligible for MFIP if all MFIP eligibility criteria are met. MAXIS will track the 4 consecutive months of DWP and will autoclose the case for the 5th month and issue a DAIL message. For applicants who were on MFIP, the 12- month period begins the month after the MFIP case was closed. See items 6 and 7 above. A 2- parent family is not eligible for DWP if either of the 2 parents has received MFIP or DWP assistance within the abo ve time periods. NOTE: For the purpose of determining if an applicant has been on MFIP in the last 12 months, a suspended or food portion only MFIP month counts as a month in which the participant received MFIP. For DWP, all 4 months of the 4- month cons ecutive period of eligibility count as DWP months, even if no benefits were issued. See 0008.06.06 (Adding a Person to the Unit - Cash) . COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2016 DWP BASES OF ELIGIBILITY 0013.05 Before DWP benefits can be issued to a family, the caregiver(s) must develop and sign an Employment Plan with a job counselor.

When a client owns an asset in whole or in part, presume the asset is wholly available unless the client proves it is not. A client may prove unavailability by verifying a legal or actual barrier to disposal of the asset that cannot reasonably be overcome. If a client claims a legal barrier and its status is unclear, refer the case to your county attorney for a legal opinion on availability. Review unavailability at each recertification and when you anticipate a change in availability.

Exclude the accounts if the unit can document that it can only access the account, or a portion of the account, to pay the deployed military persons' bills, AND the unit cannot use the funds for its own needs. Verification must be provided from the deployed military persons, a statement from the bank or financial institution or other verification documenting this arrangement. MFIP, DWP, GA: When 2 or more people own an asset, presume each person owns an equal share of the asset, EXCEPT that each joint owner of a personal checking account or savings account is considered to own the entire account. A unit may prove that it only has access to part of the asset. When the unit proves greater or smaller ownership, use the verified ownership amount to determine net asset value for both applicants and participants. See 0010 (Verification) . SNAP: SNAP has no asset test. MSA: Consider assets unavailable if the client must have another owner's permission to dispose of the asset, and the other person refuses. When 2 or more people own an asset, presume that each person owns an equal share of the asset. When there is only 1 MSA applicant or participant account holder on a jointly -held account, presume all funds in the account belong to the MSA applicant or participant. If the other owner of a joint account is an MSA applicant or participant or a responsible relative whose assets you deem available, presume ownership of equal shares. Allow a person who disagrees with your presumption an opportunity to rebut the presumption. When joint owners prove greater or smaller ownership, use the verified ownership amount.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 WHOSE ASSETS TO CONSIDER - SPONSORS W/ I -134 0015.48.06 The policy on how to deem assets of sponsors of immigrants depends on what affidavit of support was executed by the sponsor. There are 2 different affidavits of support (forms I -134 and I -864). Each form has its own deeming requirements. For deeming assets of sponsors who executed the I -864, see 0015.48.03 (Whose Assets to Consider Sponsors W/ I -864). Deeming of assets provisions do not apply to: Refu gees. People granted asylum. LPRs who were refugees or asylees. People paroled for a period of 1 year. Cuban/Haitian Entrants.

SNAP: No provisions. MSA: Consider the assets of an immigrant's sponsor and the sponsor's spouse if the sponsor and spouse live together. For the purp ose of this section, a sponsor is an individual (not an organization) who signed an affidavit of support as a condition of the immigrant's admission for permanent United States residence. Exclude the sponsor's and sponsor's spouse's pension funds, including IRAs and Keogh plans. Exclude from the sponsor's assets: $2,000 if the sponsor do es not live with a spouse. $3,000 if the sponsor and spouse live together, but the spouse is not also the immigrant's sponsor. $4,000 if the sponsor and spouse live together and both are the immigrant's sponsors.

Sponsor Deeming Exemption Determination Before requesting verification of a sponsor's and sponsor's spouse's income, review if the LPR who would otherwise be subject to sponsor deeming meets 1 of the 2 EXEMPTIONS listed below: Do not deem the sponsor's income if the sponsored LPR: Is a victim of extreme cru elty/battery . The LPR must provide a statement or documentation that the LPR or his/her child(ren) have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by the LPR's spouse or parent. The LPR must also meet the following 2 conditions: - NOT living with the batterer. AND - The need resulting from the battery or cruelty has a substantial connection to the need for public assistance . This EXEMPTION is limited to 12 months from the date a determination of EXEMPTION is made. The 12 -month deferment may be extended ONLY in the case of the sponsor being the batterer, and if there continues to be a need for public assistance resulting from the battery and cruelty and the battery and cruelty is recognized by a court order (an order for protection) or by an U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determination.

It also means that the sponsored LPR is not currently living with his/her sponsors or getting free shelter from others. Consi der this EXEMPTION when the sponsored LPR reports that his/her own income and any assistance provided by the sponsor or any other individuals is not adequate for the LPR to obtain food and shelter because the sponsor is failing or is unable to provide support or when the LPR is unable to locate the sponsor. Under these circumstances, do not request verification of a sponsor's income directly from the sponsor, instead ask the sponsored LPR to provide verification of the actual amount of income provided by the sponsor to his/her household. Deem the actual amount of income provided by the sponsor as available income to the sponsored LPR. A determination of indigence and what the exemption means must be explained to the sponsored LPR. An individual has the right to refuse a determination of indigence but must be informed about the consequence of such a refusal on program eligibility in a manner he/she can comprehend. If the LPR or their authorized representative affirmatively refuses the indigence determinat ion, the sponsor's income must be deemed toward the sponsored LPR's household. Such refusal must be case noted with details about the reasons for such refusal. Once a determination of indigence exemption is made, it remains in effect for 12 months beginning on the date such a determination is made, regardless of any additional information that may be obtained from the SAVE query on the sponsor within the unit's certification period. The 12- month indigence determination must be reviewed before an addition al 12- month determination may be approved.

Request verification of a sponsor's total income when: A sponsored LPR does not qualify for an exemption from sponsor deeming as explained above. OR A sponsored LPR meets the criteria for the indigent exemption but has opted out of the indigence determination. In both of these situations, the LPR must explain why the sponsor is not providing assistance to him/her as attested by the sponsor's signature on I -864 Affidavit of Support. Help the client to obtain collateral statement or documentation to support the indigence exemption determination. The sponsored LPR is responsible for obtaining the cooperation of the sponsor and for providing the information and documentation necessary to calculate deemed income. The county agency must assist the unit in obtaining necessary verification. If necessary, SAVE can be used to provide the sponsor's name, address and Social Security Number.

Self-employed people generally work for themselves rather than an employer. However, people employed in some types of services may be self -employed even if they have an employer or work out of another's business location (for example: real estate sales people, people who work for commission sales, manufacturer's representatives, independent contractors). Self -employed people may or may not have FICA deducted from the check an employer or another party issues to them. When self -employed people indicate they are independent contractors, check with the business the self -employed client is contracting with to see if it considers the client to be self -employed or an employee. If the business states that it considers the self -employed person to be an independent contractor, then the client is self -employed. People who provide day care in their own homes are self -employed. People who provide day care in someone else's home are not self -employed. Self-employed people may own a business solely or in partnership. Income from a sole proprietorship is self -employment income. When the business is a partnership or S -Corporation, all wages, draws, guaranteed payments, or compensation of officers paid to the business owner or a household member is considered earned income. Any other income from a partnership or S -Corporation is self -employment inc ome. S-Corporations are considered self -employment businesses. Income received by the shareholders is countable income regardless of whether the individual decides to reinvest his or her income back into the corporation. See 0002.59 (Glossary: RSDI...) for the definition of S -Corporation. C-Corporations are NOT self -employment businesses.

If the business has been operating for less than 12 months, then divide by the number of months the business has been operating. - This method is based on using an annual average to calculate self -employment income. - Document the calculation and whi ch option the applicant or participant has chosen in CASE/NOTEs . Current program participants must continue to use the same method for each self -employment income source, unless they meet a program -specific changing option (listed under program provisions below). If the client applies for an additional program, they may choose to use either the 50% gross or taxable income method for that new program.

The agency must determine self -employment using the method the client chooses for each self -employment business. If business taxes for the most current tax year were filed within the last 12 months, the client can choose either the taxable method or the 50% method. If a client has not filed business taxes within the past 12 months, the client must use the 50% method. If the income and expenses on the business tax forms from the most recent tax year are not reflective of what the client reasonably anticipates for income in the certification period, the client must use the 50% method. Document the option the applicant or participant has chosen, all calculations and forms used in CASE /NOTES. Self-Employment situations that have a farm loss DO NOT have the choice of the 50% of gross earnings or the taxable method to calculate Self -Employment income for any unit member's self- employment business. See 0017.15.33.24 (Self -Employment Income from Farming) and the SNAP Farm Loss Policy Guide (PDF) . Compute monthly self -employment income by averaging the income and expenses, regardless of whether the household receives the income monthly or less often than monthly. Do separate calculations for each self -employment business the unit has. Record them separately. 50% of gross earnings from self -employment: - Business income as determined by business records or self -employment forms. This method is based on using current income, received 30 days prior to the date of application, to calculate self -employment inc ome. Current income is an indicator of the gross business receipts that will be available during the next 6- month period. When gross business receipts fluctuate to the extent that the preceding 30 days is not an accurate indication of anticipated gross business receipts, use a reasonable period of time and gross business receipts (for example, the last 3 months) to determine current income. A longer or shorter period of time can be used if necessary. - Review monthly gross business earnings. Gross ear nings are defined as earned income before taxes and deductions. - Subtract 50% from the monthly gross income amount to use as business expenses. See TEMP Manual TE02.08.192 (How to Code STAT /BUSI for SNAP Cases). OR Taxable Income method: - Use business income as determined from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax forms that have been filed with the IRS within the last 12 months for the most recent tax year. This method is based on using an annual average to calculate self - employment income. - Review gross business income using complete business tax returns, forms and schedules.

OTHER LOANS: Consider the loan available when the student receives the award letter from the lending institution. Prorate the loan over the months it covers, regardless of the disbursement dates. STATE WORK STUDY INCOME: Consider work study income available in the month the student receives it. If the student receives or signs the award letter before the school year starts, do not budget the income until the school year begins. If a student signs or receives the award letter after some of the months it covers have passed, prorate the aid over the months it covers, but disregard the portion intended for prior months. If a student verifies that a school withheld the student's aid because of unsatisfactory progress, do not budget the income. To arrive at a monthly amount to budget: 1. Exclude al l Title IV or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) educational assistance. 2. Exclude educational assistance earmarked for specific costs of tuition, mandatory fees, books, supplies, dependent care, transportation, or miscellaneous personal expenses (other than living expenses). 3.

Not all documents from the Social Security Administration (SSA) report gross RSDI. The following are SSA documents and interfaces you can use to determine and verify the amount of gross RSDI. Do not require clients to provide a specific document if another is available which provides the information. Initial award letter (SSA -4926 -SM). This lists gross RSDI, the Medicare premium, and the monthly payment (net RSDI) to the client. The gross amount is the figure described as \"The total amount of your monthly benefit before deductions\". SVES interf ace on MAXIS. See TEMP TPQY Interface). State Online Query (SOLQ), SSA's online data exchange. See the SOLQ User Manual on the MAXIS SIR web site under the SSA County DHS Quarterly Meeting Site. Some documents report gross RSDI as a whole dollar figure. Others report the figure in dollars and cents. Count only the whole dollar figure as gross RSDI; drop any cents. Other SSA documents report only the payment to the client and the Medicare premium. Do not add these figures together to calculate gross RSDI. Because the client payment amount is truncated, adding the figures together may not yield the correct amount of gross RSDI.

The gain is the differen ce between the purchase and selling price of the real property minus allowable expenses. Count capital gains from the sale of real property as unearned income. The IRS Capital Gains and Losses form (1040 - Schedule D) includes real property capital gains. The client must report Schedule D capital gains from the sale of real property. Use the tax form figures to verify the countable capital gain. SNAP: Capital Gains and Capital Losses result from the sale of business goods or equipment. A capital gain or loss is the differen ce between the amount the business paid for an asset and the amount received when that asset is sold. Capital Assets are all types of property that are held by a company for investment and useful business purposes. Capital ass ets are those assets used by the business to make a profit. Most types of business property are considered capital assets, including: Property for sale to customers, like inventory or merchandise . Intellectual property, like patents, trademarks, or copyrights . Accounts receivable or notes receivable; accounts receivable have value and can be sold, so they a re considered assets. Depreciable property (equipment and vehicles, for example) used in your business. Real property (land and buildings) used in your business. Capital gains from self -employment businesses count as income. Unless the client is in the business of selling assets, exclude capital gains from the sale of the client's assets, regardless of whether the asset was excluded. If the client is in the business of selling assets, such as a farmer who holds grain until the prices change, the capital gain is self -employment and counts as income. Capital losses are deducted on the tax return as a loss from self -employment businesses , which reduces the net profit. Capital losses from one self-employment business can be used to reduce total countable self -employment income from other businesses within the SNAP unit, within the same tax year. Capital gains and losses recorded on self -employment tax forms, such as Schedules C and F, include items such as the sale of livestock or grain. You may not be able to distinguish capital gains on self -employment forms from other self -employment income. The IRS Capital Gains and Losses form (Schedule D) includes excluded and counted capital gains. The client must clarify whether Schedule D capital gains are from the sale of an asset or from self -employment. In addition to capital gains and losses from the sale of assets, Schedule D includes capital gain distributions. Capital gain distributions are dividends from stock or mutual funds. See 0017.15.42 (Interest and Dividend Income) . Use the tax form figures to verify the countable capital gain or allowable loss. If the client did not file tax forms, determine the capital gain using self -employment inco me procedures. See 0017.15.33 (Self -Employment Income) . Count the amount of capital gains or losses the household anticipates receiving during the months over which the income is being averaged. When capital gains or losses are not accounted for in a specific business' records it must be tracked separately on STAT/BUSI. NOTE: For personal gains and losses not related to a business, see 0002.09 (Glossary: Calendar Month...), 0017.12.03 (Unearned Income) .

For more information on military pay see MN DHS Military Income Guide on the SIR web site . Do not count any military income that is not subject to federal or state income taxes. Count as earned income any military income that is subject to federal or state income t axes and meets the definition of earned income. For the definition of EARNED INCOME, see 0002.19 (Glossary: Early...) . Count as unearned income any military income that is subject to federal or state income t axes and does not meet the definition of earned income. For the definition of EARNED INCOME, see 0002.19 (Glossary: Early...) . Count as unearned income the military pay the family of a military person receives when that military person is out of the home on military duty. Do not make a Child Support Referral for a MARRIED parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. Do not count combat or hazard duty pay received as a result of deployment to a combat zone. SNAP: Military income is generally made available to the household members through a direct deposit of all or a portion of the mili tary person's pay into a joint bank account. Occasionally the income is made available to the household members through an allotment arrangement made by the military person for a portion of the pay to be sent to the family. When an allotment arrangement is made, it is the military person who receives the \"allotment\" with the bulk of the pay being sent directly to the family. Count as unearned income only that portion of the military pay that the applicant or participant household receives when determining the household's income, regardless of the arrangement made by the military person. Exclude all combat and/or hazard duty pay. See 0017.06 (Excluded Income) , 0017.12.03 (Unearned Income) . Combat pay, also referred to as hazardous or hazard duty pay, is additional payment military personnel receive as a result of deployment to a designated combat zone. If an applicant or participant tells you at application, recertification or contacts you with information that he/ she has received or will receive income from military pay or an allotment from an absent member who is deployed to a combat zone, follow the steps below to determine the combat or hazard duty pay exclusion: 1. Establish the amount of the military person's pay that was actually available to the household prior to the deployment of the military person to a designated combat zone. If the military person was part of the household prior to deployment this amount would be the net military pay. Net military pay means the amount of pay received by the military person prior to being deployed to the combat zone. After the military person is deployed to a combat zone any increase in the money coming to the household would be considered combat or hazard duty pay. For example, a military member is deployed directly to a combat zone. The predeployment take home pay was $1,000/month. The income increases to $1,200/month after being deployed. When calculating eligibility exclude the $200 combat pay and count only the remaining $1,000 as unearned income to the household. This $1,000 is the net military pay. NOTE: If the military person was not part of the household prior to the military person's deployment to a designated combat zone, count the amount the absent military person actually made available to the family prior to deployment. 2. Determine the amount of the military pay that the military person is making available to his /her family. 3. If the amount of military pay made available is equal to or less than the amount the household received prior to deployment to a combat zone, count all of the military pay as unearned income. If the military pay available exceeds the amount the household received prior to deployment, exclude the excess amount. See TEMP Manual TE02.10.92 (Designated Combat Zones) for a list of designated Combat Zones and the designated effective dates for each Combat Zone. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2016 MILITARY INCOME 0017.15.93 A blank Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) form is often sent directly to the family or is mailed to the family by the deployed military person. Some households may have access to verification of military pay through the internet, or households may obt ain verification of military income by contacting the local military base financial office. Two fields on the LES form that are useful in identifying combat or hazard pay are: Field 10 Entitlements: This field identifies combat or hazard pay earned. Field 76 Remarks: This field outlines by codes or abbreviations the type of military pay earned. For example the abbreviati on HDP = Hazard Duty Pay. Do not make a Child Support Referral for a MARRIED parent who is called to military duty away from home when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. For MAXIS coding instructions, see TEMP Manual TE02.10.90 (Military Families Receiving FS, MFIP or DWP). MSA: For SSI recipients no action is required, SSA makes all income determinations. For non- SSI recipients follow GA. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 04/2017 HOUSING SUBSIDY 0017.15.99 MFIP: Count up to $50 of the value of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funded housing subsidies as unearned income toward the cash portion of the MFIP grant. Count the full amount of the subsidy if it is less than $50. HUD funded subsidies include HUD public housing, HUD funded project -based properties , and HUD funded Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) rental subsidies. Public housing or rental subsidies not provided by HUD funding do not have up to $50 of the value of the public housing or rental subsidy counted as unearned income toward the cash portion of the MFIP grant. EXEMPTIONS: The policy also does not apply to an assistance unit which includes a participant who is: Age 60 or older. OR A caregiver who is suffering from an illness, inj ury, or incapacity that has been certified by a qualified professional when the illness, injury, or incapacity is expected to continue for more than 30 days and the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. NOTE: Severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment means that a qualified professional has determined that the person's condition prevents the person from working 20 hours or more per week. OR A caregiver whose presence in the home is required due to the illness or incapacity of another member in the assistance unit, a relative in the household, or a foster child in the household when the illness/incapacity and the need for the participant's presence in the home has been certified by a qualified professional and is expected to continue for more than 30 days. This includes participants who have family members in the home who meet the Special Medical Criteria or receive waivered services. OR A caregiver who is an SSI recipient. NOTE: Do NOT apply this exemption to families with a child on SSI. Apply the following procedures for someone who lives in public housing, a HUD project -based property, or a Section 8 rental property: Deny ap plications when applicants do not provide verification of the amount of the subsidy. Close cases when verification of rent subsidy amount is not provided : - At the time of the Recertification. OR - When there is a change in the amount of the subsi dy. OR - When the participant moves to a property that provides a subsidy to the MFIP unit. For MAXIS procedures or information on how to properly complete the STAT/SHEL panel, see TEMP Manual TE02.08.159 (Housing Subsidy).

Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) , 0022.12.01 (How to Calculate Benefit Level - SNAP/MSA/GRH) , 0020 (Net Income Limits) . Subtract disregards and deductions in the specific order below to determine net income. MFIP: Apply an initial income test as noted in program provisions below. Determine net income for the initial income test by adding gross earned income, unearned income and deemed income, then subtract the following deductions in the order listed: 1. Earned income disregard. See 0018.18 (Earned Income Disregards) . 2. Allocations. Appl y allocations against earned income first. Apply any remaining allocation amount against unearned income. See 0018.30 (Allocations) . 3. Actual dependent care costs up to the maximum allowance from earned income. See 0018.09 (Dependent Care Deduction) . 4. Child and spousal support deductions. See 0018.33 (Child and Spousal Support Deductions) . If net income (after allowing the deductions above) is less than the Family Wage Level , determine the benefit level using the appropriate assistance standard. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . Compute net income EACH MONTH to use in determining benefits by subtracting the following deductions from gross earned and unearned income, including deemed income in the order listed: 1.

See 0018.33 (Child and Spousal Support Deducti ons). After you apply these deductions, follow the procedures in 0022.12 (How to Calc. Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) . If the MFIP grant you compute using this procedure is $0 or less (because the unit's income exceeds the standard), the unit is not eligible. DWP: Follow MFIP for the initial income determination. Then compare the net need for the DWP grant to the CASH portion of the appropriate Assistance Standard. The minimum cash benefit amount is $10, if income and asset tests are met. Do not vendor pay benefits of $10. In most cases once the grant amount is determined, if the participant obtains a job or receives additional earned income, or unearned income, the income is NOT used to reduce the unit's DWP benefits.

Units must report and verify all medical expenses at application. At recertification, units must verify changes in recurring medical expenses which total more than $25 and must verify any new expenses. Do not require units to verify expenses that have not changed at recertification. Units may, but are not required to, report changes in medical expenses during the certification period. If the unit voluntarily reports and verifies a change, process it following the procedures in 0007.15 (Unscheduled Reporting of Changes - Cash) , 0007.15.03 (Unscheduled Reporting of Changes - SNAP) , 0008.03 (Changes - Obtaining Information) . If you learn of a change in medical expenses from a source other than the unit (for example, MA information), act on the change if it is verified when you receive it. Do not contact the unit for additional information or verification. If the change needs additional verification, do not act on it until recertification. If a unit expects a medical expense at the time of certification but cannot verify at that time, allow the expense when they provide verification. For units that did not report a change during the certification period, do not calculate corrective payments. If the unit does not report changes of more than $25 in recurring medical expenses at recertification, calculate overpayments back to the recertification date. For regularly recurring medical expenses, MAXIS will subtract $35 per unit from the actual monthly expense to determine the amount of the deduction. For non- recurring medical expenses, the unit has these options: To allow the entire expense in 1 month. To average the expense over the remaining months of the current certification period. To allow the expense over the scheduled length of a payment plan. Clients may continue to use this expense as a deducti on for the length of the payment schedule, even into another certification period. If a unit has both recurring and non- recurring medical expenses in 1 month, list them separately and MAXIS will subtract the $35 medical deduction. Units may choose to have fluctuating expenses averaged. They may also choose to have expenses which are billed less often than monthly averaged forward over the interval between scheduled billings or, if there is no scheduled interval, over the peri od the expense is intended to cover.

See t he Minnesota Health Care Programs Eligibility Policy Manual . Do not automatically allow the total spenddown amount as an expense, unless you verified the expenses used to meet the spenddown at SNAP application or recertification and the unit has not reported further changes. Use a client's total medical expenses up to the amount of the spenddown. There are 2 medical spenddown types, 6- month and monthly. Do not assume clients who are on monthly medical spenddowns will always meet their spenddown. For applications and recertifications received on or after June 1, 2006, for households with Medicare Part D deductions, allow the actual Medicare expenses incurred. This could include the following items: - Medicare Part D premiums, if any. - Unreimbursed out -of-pocket prescription costs. - Other allowable medical expenses as outlined in this section. Expenses mu st be within the SNAP time guidelines for acceptable expenses, and must be for people listed in 0018.12 (Medical Deductions).

For some programs determining the benefit level is a separate process from determining eligibility. Retrospective budgeting is using income from a budget month to determine a client's benefits for the payment month. The budget month is the month 2 months before the payment month. See 0022.06 (How and When to Use Retrospective Budgeting) . Do not always count income from the budget month for the payment month. See 0022.06.03 (When Not to Budget Income in Retro. Cases) . Prospective budgeting is determining the client's income eligibility and benefit level using anticipated income and deductions for the payment month. See 0022.03 (How and When to Use Prospective Budgeting) . MFIP, Uncle Harry SNAP, MSA, and GA use prospective budgeting to determine the 1st 2 months' eligibility and benefit levels in most cases. All SNAP units and GRH recipients subject to Six -Month Reporting or to change reporting always use prospective budgeting. See 0022.03 (How and When to Use Prospective Budgeting) . After the 1st 2 months use prospective or retrospective budgeting, depending on the program and the client's circumstances. See 0022.09 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - Cash) , 0022.09.03 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - SNAP) . DWP uses prospective budgeting for each of the 4 months of DWP eligibility. See 0022. 12 (How to Calc. Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) . GRH is budgeted using the client's actual income for the benefit month, unless the client is a Six -Month Reporter . See 0007.03.02 (Six -Month Reporting) , 0024.03.03 (When Benefits Are Paid - SNAP/MSA/GA/GRH) . Calculate the benefit level using the income from the appropriate budget month. See 0022.12 (How to Calc. Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) , 0022.12.01 (How to Calculate Benefit Level - SNAP/MSA/GRH) . Some programs require prorating benefits. Proration can begin from the date of application, the date the client meets all eligibility requirements, or from the date the agency receives a late household report form or a late Combined Six -Month Report form. See 0022.12.03 (Proration), 0022.12.03.03 (Proration Table) . For GA Participants, budget lump sums differently from other types of income.

MFIP: In the 1st month, for some units, budgeting income to determine the benefit amount is separate from budgeting income to determine eligibility. To be eligible, clients must pass the initial income eligibility test and be within net income limits . See 0017 (Determining Gross Income) , 0018 (Determining Net Income), 0018.18 (Earned Income Disregards) . Use prospective budgeting to figure the benefit amount for the 1st 2 months of eligibility for each person who was not an eligible MFIP participant the month before the application month. This applies even if you are adding a person to a retrospectively budgeted MFIP unit. See 0008.06.06 (Adding a Person to the Unit - Cash) . If a person was an MFIP participant the month before the application month, continue the budget cycle the person was in. Als o see 0022.06 (How and When to Use Retrospective Budgeting) . If a person losing SSI is being added to the unit as a mandatory member, budget his/her income prospectively for the 1st 2 months. In budgeting income prospectively, count only income both you and the unit are reasonably certain they will get that month. If a client gives a reason that the amount an employer says it will pay is inaccurate, contact the employer for confirmation. S ee 0010.03 (Verification - Cooperation and Consent), 0010.15 (Verification - Inconsistent Information) . If you cannot reconcile the employer's and the client's claims, budget the amount the client expects to get (which might be $0). Document your action in CASE/NOTEs in MAXIS. After th e 1st 2 months of eligibility (EXCEPT for cost -of-living adjustments (COLAs) in federal benefits), continue prospectively budgeting migrant units, seasonal farmworker units, and units in which all members are homeless. See 0022.06 (How and When to Use Retrospective Budgeting) for COLA increases. DWP: To be eligible, clients must pass the initial income eligibility test and be within net income limits.

SNAP: For information about SNAP prospective budgeting, see 0022.03.01.03 (Prospective Budgeting - SNAP Provisions) . MSA: For SSI recipients, always budget the SSI Federal Benefit Rate prospectively. For non- SSI recipients, use prospective budgeting for the 1st 2 months, and use the same income you budget for the 1st month to budget the 2nd month. This is true in all months EXCEPT January of any year. Budget RSDI COLA increase prospectively (for example, budget January RSDI COLA in January). COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 PROSPECTIVE BUDGETING - PROGRAM PROVISIONS 0022.03.01 GA: For each person who was NOT a GA participant the month before the application month, use prospective budgeting to determine the benefit amount for the 1st 2 months of eligibility. For each person who was a GA participant the month before the application, continue the budgeting cycle the person was in. Change the budget cycle only if there was a change that would alter the budgeting cycle. See 0022.09 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - Cash) . GRH: GRH Six -Month Reporters use prospective budgeting based on a projection of earned and unearned income . See 0007.03.02 (Six-Month Reporting) . Use prospective budgeting when a person has $100 or more of earned income and is projected to be in the GRH setting for more than 30 days. All earned income must be converted to monthly amounts when anticipating income. MAXIS will calculate the monthly amount by using the appropriate multiplier. Use of this income multiplier does NOT constitute averaging income. The multiplier is: - 4.3 for weekly checks. - 2.15 for bi -weekly checks. - 1 for monthly checks. - 2 for semi -monthly checks. Use the most recent pay stubs and/or other available earned or unearned income verification from the previous 30 days , or a longer period of time if it gives a more accurate projection. The income verification must include the most recent pay stub and/or other earned/unearned income received dates. The date on the application/recertification form or the Combined Six -Month Report submitted by the client must be within a reasonable time period corresponding to the county date stamp of receipt. Document in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs w hat income was used and why. For self -employment income calculations, see 0017.15.33.03 (Self -Employment, Convert Inc. to Monthly Amt - Cash) .

For self -employment income calculations and the methods available, see 0017.15.33.05 (Self -Employment, Determine Countable Monthly Income - SNAP) . SIX-MONTH REPORTING AND CHANGE REPORTING SNAP UNITS SNAP units subject to Six -Month Reporting or to change reporting use prospective budgeting. All income must be converted to monthly amounts when anticipating income. MAXIS will calculate the monthly amount by using the appropriate multiplier. Use of this income multiplier does NOT constitute averaging income. The multiplier is: - 4.3 for weekly checks. - 2.15 for bi -weekly checks. - 1 for monthly checks. - 2 for semi -monthly checks. Use income received 30 days back from the most recent pay stubs and/or other available earned or unearned income verification based on the income received dates, for application s, Combined Six -Month Report, or recertification, as an indicator of the income that will be available during the next 6- month period. Document in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs what income was used and why. If income received 30 days prior to the month of application, Combined Six -Month Report, or recertification is NOT used, consider the following when determining prospective income: Use income already received in the application month through the date of approval as an indicator of the income that will be available during the 6- month period. When the date of application and the date of the interview are different, document in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs what income was used. Use only anticipated income both the county agency and the client are reasonably certain will be received during the certification period. Document this information in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs. When the unit is unsure of the amount of income or when it will be received, count only that portion of the income th at can be anticipated with reasonable certainty. If a client gives a reason that the amount an employer says it will pay is inaccurate, contact the employer for confirmation. See 0010.03 (Verification - Cooperation and Consent) , 0010.15 (Verification - Inconsistent Information) . If you cannot reconcile the employer's and the client's claims, budget the amount the client expects to get (which might be $0). Document your action in CASE/PERSON NOTEs in MAXIS. Do not use past income as an indicator o f income that will be available during the 6 -month period if the unit cannot anticipate this income continuing in the future. Document in MAXIS CASE/NOTEs why past income was not used for the 6- month period. Convert regular recurring income received less often than monthly into a monthly amount. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 PROSPECTIVE BUDGETING - SNAP PROVISIONS 0022.03.01.03 When income fluctuates to the extent that the 30 days income prior to the application month is NOT an accurate indication of anticipated income, use a reasonable period of time and income. Document in MAXIS CASE/NOTE the period of time and income used for the 6- month period. When the client anticipates receiving future income from a source not received in the 30 days prior to the application, Combined Six -Month Report, or recertification, use an amount both the client and the county agency are reasonably certain will be received. When recalculating a new 6 -month report period, take into account income received in the last 30 days. Use any an ticipated income the unit and county agency are reasonably certain will be received during the next 6- month period. If the unit reports no change in income on the Combined Six Month Review (DHS -5576) (PDF) , continue to budget the same income for the next 6 months. If wages are held by the employer at the request of the client, count this income in the month the wages would have been received by the client. Anticipate DWP, GA, and MSA grants for the period of time the agency is reasonably certain these grants w ill be received during the certification period. For DWP/ SNAP households, count the amount of DWP benefits the agency can reasonably anticipa te once the client has met the Employment Plan requirements. If the agency cannot determine when or what amount of DWP benefits a client will receive, even though the client has cooperated, budget only that part of the DWP benefits the agency and the client are reasonably certain the client will receive that month. Do not increase the unit's SNAP benefits IF a participant unit or unit member is disqualified from GA for not cooperating wit h tort liability requirements. Compute benefits using the cash grant the unit would have received had the disqualification not occurred. For units with seasonal income, it may be appropriate to use the most recent past season's income to determine the amount of income that will be received during the 6-month budget period. Consider any anticipated income fluctuations and new circumstances. Budget COLA increases in federal benefits prospectively. Budget recurring medical expenses prospectively. See 0018.12 (Medical Deductions) . UNCLE HARRY FOOD SUPPORT UNITS Use prospective budgeting for the 1st 2 months of eligibility for each Uncle Harry Food Support (UHFS) member who was not a Minnesota SNAP participant the month before the application month. After the 1st 2 months of eligibility, continue to budget prospectively the following UHFS units: Units with no counted or excluded earned income, no GA income, and no members who have received counted or excluded earned income within the 3 months before the budget month. Units with all members in the migrant work stre am. See MIGRANT FARMWORKER UNITS in 0002.41 (Glossary: Medically Necessary...) . Units in which any member is a seasonal farmworker.

For example, base the March benefit on income and expenses in January. MFIP: Some units are always prospectively budgeted. See 0022.03.01 (Prospective Budgeting - Program Provisions) . For all other units, use retrospective budgeting after the 1st 2 months of initial eligibility. When an assistance unit applies for MFIP in the same month MFIP was terminated, and the month prior to application was retrospectively budgeted, continue the retrospective budgeting cycle for the month of application and the following month. For each person who was an MFIP participant the month before the application month, continue the budgeting cycle the person was in. Special budgeting provisions apply to income from self -employment. See 0017.15.33.03 (Self -Employment, Convert Inc. to Monthly Amt - Cash ). Always budget COLA increases in federal benefits retrospectively, EXCEPT for units that get a COLA increase in 1 of their 2 i nitial months.

SNAP: Uncle Harry Food Support (UHFS) units are the ONLY SNAP units which may be subject to retrospective budgeting. The following provisions ONLY apply to UHFS units. Budget all cash assistance grant income prospectively, even though you budget a unit's other income ret rospectively. Do not increase SNAP benefits in response to a decrease in RCA, MSA, GA, or SSI because a participant unit or unit member does not provide mandatory verifications for the cash program or if a participant unit or unit member is disqualified from GA for not cooperating with tort liability requirements. Compute benefits using the cash grant the unit would have received had a reduction in the cash grant for failure to provide mandatory verifications not occurred. This applies for the duration of the reduction in the cash program. There are special budgeting provisions for contract income of less than a year and student financial aid. Unlike other income, do not budget these incomes prospectively for the 2 beginning months, if you expect to budget the unit retrospectively after the 1st 2 months. Budget contract income of less than a year and student financial aid retrospectively over the months they are intended to cover. Budget any other income and expenses the unit may have prospectively for the 1st 2 months, and retrospectively thereafter. See 0017.09 (Converting Income to Monthly Amounts) , 0017.15.36.03 (When to Budget Student Financial Aid) . Budget yearly contracts over a 12 -month period, even if the client receives the income in a shorter period of time. Do not follow the special budgeting procedures above for yearly contracts. With the EXCEPTION of those received in the initial 2 months, budget all COLA increases for federal benefits 2 months after the month of receipt, even if the unit is otherwise subject to prospective budgeting.

MFIP: Do not switch the budgeting cycle for MFIP units unless the unit's status changes FROM or TO migrant, seasonal farm worker, or homeless. If the un it's status changes FROM migrant, seasonal farm worker, or homeless, begin retrospective budgeting the month after the month the change is reported. If the unit's status changes TO migrant, seasonal farm w orker, or homeless, the 1st prospective month i s the 1st month after timely report of the change in status. If the change in status is not reported timely, the 1st month you are able to switch t he budgeting cycle is the 1st prospective month. DWP, GRH: No provisions. SNAP: See 0022.09.03 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - SNAP) . MSA: When an MSA participant becomes eligible for SSI, begin prospective budgeting using the SSI FBR in the 1st month of SSI receipt. Continue to prospectively budget using the SSI FBR for any month in which the person is an SSI recipient. See SSI RECIPIENT in 0002.63 (Glossary: Special Diet...) . When an MSA participant loses SSI eligibility, review eligibility for MSA. If non -payment of SSI is for reasons other than excess income or recoupment, close MSA. If the sole reason for SSI non -payment is recoupment or suspension due to income, continue to prospectively budget the case using the SSI FBR. If SSI non -paymen t is due to receipt of recurring income (not a 1 -month suspension), continue to prospectively budget for 2 months using ACTUAL income. Switch to retrospective budgeting in the 3rd month of non -payment of SSI. GA: Change from retrospective to prospective budgeting when a suspended unit has a change in recurring net income of $50 or more. Recurring net income is the amount after work expenses and dependent care deductions, but before disregards. A change in recurring net income fits this definition if the recurring net income in the budget month which caused the suspension is at least $50 higher or lower than either the month before the suspension month or the suspension month. Do not use the amount of a 3rd or 5th paycheck to calculate the $50 change. Use prospective budgeting to determine the benefit level for the 1st 2 months after the suspension month.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2019 NEW SPOUSE INCOME 0022.11 MFIP, DWP: Under the New Spouse Income (NSI) policy, earned and unearned income for some newly married assistance unit members may not be counted in calculating a family's grant amount. The Designated Spouse is the person whose income may not be counted. See DESIGNATED SPOUSE 0002.15 (Glossary: Deed...) . To determine the Designated Spouse If only 1 newly -married member is in an existing MFIP, DWP or RCA assistance unit, the spouse joining the assistance unit will be the Designated Spouse. If both newly -married members are part of the same OR different existing MFIP, DWP or RCA assista nce units, they may choose, but are not required to choose, who is the Designated Spouse. - If the newly -married members do not choose a Designated Spouse, the eligibility worker should use the current case information to determine which designation would most benefit the household. Things that may be considered include: which spouse has the most counted income, which spouse has recent work history and will the person's personal situation allow the income to not be counted (see below). If neither spouse has income, the eligibility worker will select the 1st spouse to have counted earned or unearned income during the 12 consecutive months as the Designated Spouse. If the Designated Spouse fits into any of the 4 categories below their income must continue to count: Failing to provide Social Security Number. Having a current fraud disqualification. Being a fleeing felon. Being a parole violator. Once determined, the Designated Spouse remains the same. The period that the NSI policy covers is the 12 c onsecutive calendar months beginning the month following the month of marriage. See 0010.18.01 (Mandatory Verifications - Cash Assistance) , 0017.11 (Determining New Spouse Income) . The 12 consecutive months: Begin the month after the month of marriage. May include a period of program ineligibility of 30 days or greater. Are not altered or cancelled by eligibility switching between DWP, MFIP or RCA. To be eligible for the New Spouse Income policy, an existing assistance unit must: Be active on MFIP, DWP, or RCA in the month of marriage. Have a verified marriage date of 12 -01-18 or later. Have a combined gross income that does not exceed 275% of the Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG). See 0017.11 (Determining New Spouse Income) . Have the Designated Spouse selected.

BENEFIT LEVEL - MFIP/DWP/GA 0022.12 For sanction procedures, see 0012.21 (Responsible Relatives Not in the Home) , 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . MFIP: MFIP is composed of both federal block grant money and state money. MFIP covers some people who cannot be funded by federal money: Some non -citizens. See 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration MFIP See LEGAL CUSTODIAN in 0002.37 (Glossary: Learning...) . Also see 0014.03.03 (Determining the Cash Assistance Unit) . The procedure to determine the grant amount differs based upon the types of income the unit receives. If the unit receives NO INCOME (other than MFIP), the Transitional Standard is the total MFIP grant. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . If the unit receives UNEARNED INCOME ONLY, subtract the amount of unearned income in the budget month from the Transitional Standard for the corresponding payment month to determine the total MFIP grant. If the unit has EARNED INCOME ONLY: 1. Subtract the net earned income in the budget month from the Family Wage Level for the corresponding payment month. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . For APPLICANT cases, use the Family Wage Level when budgeting income to determine whether the unit meets the initial month's eligibility test. 2. If the difference you computed in Step 1 is MORE THAN OR EQUAL TO th e Transitional Standard, the Transitional Standard is the total MFIP grant. If the difference is LESS THAN the Transitional Standard, the amount of the difference is the total MFIP grant. If the unit has both EARNED AND UNEARNED INCOME: 1. Subtract t he net earned income in the budget month from the Family Wage Level for the corresponding payment month. 2. If the difference you computed in Step 1 is MORE THAN the Transitional Standard, subtract the unit's unearned income in the budget month from the Transitional Standard. The difference is the total MFIP grant. If the difference you computed in Step 1 is LESS THAN the Transitional Standard, subtract the unit's unearned income in the budget month from the amount of the difference. The remaining amoun t is the total MFIP grant. For applicant cases, prorate the benefit. See 0022.12.03 (Proration) . For addendum cases, do not prorate the benefit. See 0008.06.06 (Adding a Person to the Unit - Cash) . Subtract the recoupment if applicable. See 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) . Issue the food portion of the grant as EBT. Issue any remaining amount in cash. For the food portion amount, see 0020.09 COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 HOW TO CALC. BENEFIT LEVEL - MFIP/DWP/GA 0022.12 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . Use the amount of the MFIP food portion when you report SNAP benefits to other agencies. Also use the food portion of MFIP when issui ng expedited food assistance. See 0004 (Emergencies) . When there are people in the MFIP unit who are not eligible for the food portion, subtract a prorated share of the food portion for that person. To calculate the amount: 1. Calculate the food portion for this assistance unit. See 0022 (Budgeting and Benefit Determination) . 2. Divide the food portion by number of people in the MFIP unit. 3. Multiply the result of Step 2 by the number of unit members eligible for the food portion. EXAMPLE: The food portion for a household of 4 is $601. Two unit members already received SNAP this month. $601 food portion divided by 4 unit members x 2 eligible members = $ 300. Truncate if necessary. DWP: The amount of cash benefits a unit is eligible for is based on the number of people in the unit, the family maintenance needs , personal needs allowance, and countable income. See 0002.13 (Glossary: Conciliation...) for the definition of countable income. Evaluate the income of the unit that is requesting DWP, allowing the same disregards for earned income that are allowed under MFIP. See 0018.18 (Earned Income Disregards) . Family maintenance needs include: Housing costs. Utility costs. $35/month telephone allowance. Up to $70/month per eligible unit member for personal needs allowance. Use verified shelter and utility expenses, and the flat rate of $35 per month for telephone service, if verified, to determine the amount of the grant. When the participant has a verified job pending at the time the family applies for DWP, factor the prospective earnings into the benefit calculation. The maximum monthly benefit amount available under DWP is the difference between the unit's maintenance needs plus personal needs and the unit's countable income not to exceed the CASH portion of the appropriate MFIP standard of need. For the purpose of this determination, \"MFIP standard of need\" means the Transitional Standard for the unit's size. See 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) . The minimum cash benefit amount, if income and asset tests are met, is $10. Do not vendor pay benefits of $10. Units must pass the initial income test. See 0018 (Determining Net Income) . Households whose income exceeds the total of their family maintenance needs and personal needs allowance, and the units' income is more than the cash portion of the MFIP standard but less than the Family Wage Level , will receive the $10.00 minimum monthly grant. They are also eligible for Employment Services, Child Care Assistance, and supportive services. For applicant cases, prorate the amount for the 1st month benefit. See 0022.12.03 (Proration) . Subtract the recoupment if applicable. See 0025.21.15 . COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 HOW TO CALC. BENEFIT LEVEL - MFIP/DWP/GA 0022.12 For details on the calculation of benefits, see TEMP Manual TE20.06 (DWP Example - Initial Benefit Calculation). Once the monthly grant is determined, vendor pay the housing and utilities. Vendor payment of telephone services is a county option. In most cases once the grant amount is determined, if the participant obtains a job or receives additional earned income, or unearned income (such as child support), the income is NOT used to reduce the unit's DWP benefits. See 0022.21 ( Income Overpayment Relating to Budget Cycl e). When any of the following circumstances occur, recalculate the unit's benefits and approve new results, allowing for proper n otice: The unit's income decreases. There are changes in the unit's househo ld size. There are changes in the unit's family maintenance needs. This recalculation may result in determining an overpayment or issuing a supplement. DWP benefits are NOT considered TANF cash assistance and are NOT counted towards the 60- month ti me limit. SNAP, MSA, GRH: See 0022.12.01 (How to Calculate Benefit Level - SNAP/MSA/GRH) . GA: Determine the benefit level as follows: 1. Subtract net income in the budget month from the assistance sta ndard for the corresponding payment month. See 0018 (Determining Net Income) , 0020.18 (GA Assistance Standards) , 0022.03 (How and When to Use Prospective Budgeting) , 0022.06 (How and When to Use Retrospective Budgeting) . 2. For applicants, or units with late HRFs, prorate the benefit. See 0007 (Reporting) , 0022.12.03 (Proration) . 3. Determine if there is a recoupable amount. If there is, subtract the recoupment. See 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) . 4. Issue benefits of $10 or more. Issue benefits which are less than $10 because of recoupment or because part of the benefit is vendor paid. See 0024.09 (Protective and Vendor Payments) . In addition, see 0011.27.03 (Drug Felons) for special provisions for units containing a member convicted of a drug felony. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 HOW TO CALCULATE BENEFIT LEVEL - SNAP/MSA/GRH 0022.12.01 MFIP, DWP, GA See Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) .

The Minimum SNAP Allotment is $16 for 1- and 2 -person units. For units in the 1st month of certification, issue benefits which are less than $10 solely because of recoupment. If the benefit is less than $10 for any other reason, issue $0, but do not deny the application. After the 1st month: If 1- or 2-member units are eligible for less than $ 16 in monthly SNAP , issue $ 16 unless there is an overpayment which you are recouping. Issue SNAP monthly benefits to units of 3 or more m embers even if the amount is less than $ 16. A unit of 3 or more people may pass the gross income test and meet net income limits but be eligible for $0 in benefits. For these units, approve the application or keep the ongoing case open.

Subtract $20 dollars from the client's SSI FBR. For information about the SSI Federal Benefit Rate (FBR), see 0029.06.03 (Supplemental Security Income Program) . Do NOT allow the $20 disregard for residents of a long term care facility for which MA pays their cost of care. Do not make any adjustments due to other income the client may have (SSA has already adjusted the SSI payment). 2. Locate the appropriate standard in 0020.21 (MSA Assistance Standards) . Add any special need items the client is eligible for. See 0023 (Special Needs Payments) . 3. Subtract the result of Step 1 from the re sult of Step 2. The difference is the MSA benefit for the month. In the case of a married couple where BOTH partners have a basis of eligibility, divide the total by 2 to determine the benefit amount for eac h partner. 4. Determine if there is a recoupa ble amount. If there is, subtract the recoupment. See 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) . FOR NON -SSI RECIPIENTS 1. Locate the appropriate assistance standard in 0020.21 (MSA Assistance Standards) . Add any special need items the client is eligible for in 0023 (Special Needs Payments) . 2.

MAXIS can also send benefits to the county office for the client to pick up. MAXIS sets an initial delivery method for clients. Issue benefits via EBT unless the client meets an EBT exclusion criteria. See TEMP Manual TE16.07 (EBT - Issuance Defaults and Exclusion Codes) for exclusion criteria. The initial delivery method for clients who meet the EBT exclusion code criter ia is regular mail. MAXIS may automatically change delivery when a client has requested too many replacements in a 6- month period. See 0024.04.04 (Changes in Automatic Benefit Delivery Method) , 0024.06 (Provisions for Replacing Benefits) . Clients may request a more secure delivery method at any time. A case that has selected direct deposit will have cash benefits sent directly to the checking or savings account number noted on the DISB panel in MAXIS. When a direct deposit account is set up, there will be an initial 10 day pre- note period during which benefits will be issued in the form of a warrant/EBT. Direct deposit cases may be excluded from EBT. EXCEPT to issue emergency benefits, use the same delivery method for all cash programs for which the client is eligible. Each time you authorize a benefit payment, MAXIS stores the payment request in an issuance transaction file. Based on this file, MAXIS issues benefits using 1 of the processes below: OVERNIGHT NIGHTLY ISSUANCE PROCESS Each non- holiday weekday evening, MAXIS searches the issuance transaction file for transactions coded as replacement or nightly issuance. The Issuance Operation Center (IOC) prepares and mails these benefits by 10:00 a.m. the next working day. MAXIS automatically holds some types of case reinstatements until the correct issuance date. Direct deposit transaction is processed overnight and may not appear in the client's account for 2 business days. EBT transactions will appear in clients' account by 10:00 a.m. the next calendar day. ONGOING ISSUANCE PROCESS After each end- of-month cutoff date, MAXIS searches the issuance transaction file for transactions coded as ongoing issuance. Benefits are available by the scheduled day. ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER Regular overnight EBT issuances are deposited into client accounts at 10:00 a.m. the following day. Overnight issuance will meet the requirements for expedited SNAP issuance if the client already has a card with which he/ she can access the benefits. RAPID ELECTRONIC ISSUANCE (REI) REI is the issuance of benefits on the same day they are approved. REIs processed before 12:00 Noon will be available at 1:00 p.m. daily. REIs processed from 12:00 Noon but before 5:00 p.m. w ill be available at 6:00 p.m. daily. The issuance method appearing in MAX IS will show EBT REI.

If you issue a replacement, and later the post office or the client returns the original or replacement to the Issuance Operation Center (IOC), that replacement does not affect the delivery method. DWP: There is no effect on the delivery method for warrants throughout the period of DWP eligibility. This also applies if you issue a replacement, and later the post office or the client returns the original or replacement to the Issuance Operation Center (IOC), that replacement does not affect the delivery method.

Notify the unit each time it receives weekly benefits that it will not receive subsequent weekly benefits unless it claims need or has good cause for not claiming need. The advance notice requirement in 0026.12 (Timing of Notices) does not apply when issuing benefits under this option. All forms used for determining assistance weekly must meet DHS standards in TE12.02.01 (County Designed Forms). Do not use this method of benefit payment beyond the 1st full calendar month after the month of application or for a unit that receives or is expected to receive countable income within the month of application or the following month. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 07/1998 CASHING WARRANTS 0024.05 Public assistance warrants are drawn directly on the State Treasury, not a bank.

They must state why they need a replacement (for example: lost in the mail, never received, or destroyed). If you can prove a warrant went back to the Issuance Operations Center (IOC) or has stale dated, do not require an affidavit. County agencies may require clients to file a police report if the request for replacement is for a lost, stolen, or destroyed warrant. If the warrant has been cashed, request copies of the warrant(s) following procedures outlined in TEMP Manual TE02.11.01 (Request Copy of Cashed Warrant or Repl One).

Return them to the Issuance Operations Center at the end of the month. Issue a replacement. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 PROTECTIVE AND VENDOR PAYMENTS 0024.09 Protective and vendor payments are alternatives to issuing benefits directly to clients. Protective payments give a client's assistance benefits to a payee other than the client. The payee is responsible to pay for the client's needs up to the amount of the benefit. Vendor payments are cash assistance benefits paid directly to a provider of goods or services. Protective and vendor payments may be mandatory or optional. The county agency may not act as vendor of a client's grant. You may use the Mandatory Vendor Form - Request for Information (DHS- 3365) (PDF) to request shelter or utility expense information from clients. This is not a required form. Clients can provide this information in other ways if they choose. MFIP: Use alternative payment methods for the cash portion of MFIP in the following situations: Issue to a vendor when you find this is the most effective way to resolve an emergency. Issue to a vendor or protective payee when clients have a pattern of money mismanagement. The county agency director or director's designee must approve a proposal for protective or vendor payments for money mismanagement. The county agency must provide training on managing money. Document the need for and the method of payment. If the need for protective payee or vendor payments will last beyond 2 years, ask t he court to appoint a legal representative. Issue to a vendor or protective payee if the client completes the Request for Voluntary Vendor Payment (DHS -2984) (PDF) form. Issue MFIP as a vendor payment out of the cash p ortion of assistance for shelter and utilities for units with a member who was convicted of a drug felony or failed a random drug test within 10 years from the date of application or recertification. If the vendor's refusal to accept partial payment is due to a legality or company policy, do not vendor pay the shelter cost (for example, real estate taxes). Vendor pay the shelter cost if the vendor's refusal to accept partial payment is based on an agreement made between the vendor and client. If there is an amount left over, issue it directly to the unit. See 0011.27.03 (Drug Felons) . When possible, issue MFIP to a protective payee when a minor caregiver and minor child live with the minor caregiver' s parent, other adult relative, legal guardian or legal custodian, or in an adult -supervised supportive living arrangement. See 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 20) . Issue voluntary vendor pay ments only for shelter and utilities. Issue up to the cash portion of MFIP to a vendor for shelter and, at county option, utilities if the unit is subject to the 2 nd through 6th month of any Employment Services, orientation, or child support sanction. Continue to vendor pay the shelter (and utilities, if applicable) for 6 months after the month in which the participant(s) return to compliance. If the vendor's refusal to accept partial payment is due to a legality or company policy, do not vendor pay the shelter cost (for example, real estate taxes). Vendor pay the shelter cost if the vendor's refusal to accept partial payment is based on an agreement made between the vendor and client. See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . Inform clients whose grants are vendor paid how fluctuating grants due to changes in earned or unearned income will affect the amount of their vendor payments. When the information needed to pay the vendor(s) is not on file, send a 10- day notice of adverse action, proposing to terminate COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 PROTECTIVE AND VENDOR PAYMENTS 0024.09 assistance unless you receive ALL of the following items before the effective date of the notice: The amount of the shelter and/or utilities. The date when shelter is due. The name and address of the landlord/caretaker/mortgage holder and/or utility company. Do not terminate assistance if the participant provides information about and completes a release to contact the vendor. Do not terminate assistance if the participant verifies he or she does not incur shelter and/or utilities. To determine the amount to vendor pay for utilities, choose 1 of the following methods: The average of t he actual monthly cost of utilities for the family for the prior 12 months (if the family has maintained their current residence for 12 months or more). The amount of the monthly budget plan set by the local utility company for the famil y's current res idence. The estimated monthly utility costs (in consultation with the client) for the dwelling in which the family currently resides. For the food portion of MFIP, follow the SNAP provisions of 0024. 09.01 (Protective and Vendor Payments - SNAP/MSA/GA/GRH) . Document and review the need for the method of payment at least annually. DWP: Follow MFIP for protective payee and vendoring partial payment provisions. Vendor pay all family maintenance needs (housing and utilities) up to the amount of the DWP grant for the entire period of DWP eligibility when possible. Do not vendor pay t he minimum cash benefit amount of $10. At county option, you may also vendor pay the standard phone amount of $35.00. A unit with high shelter expenses may not be getting additional cash benefits (for example, personal needs) because the entire amount of the DWP benefits is paid out in a vendor payment for the family's shelter needs. For units receiving personal needs allowance payments, issue the personal needs allowance payments via Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT). For more information, see 0022.12 (How to Calc. Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) , 0020.09 (MFIP/DWP Assistance Standards) and 0024.04.03.03 (Benefit Delivery --Program Provisions) .

Also, participants may, or in some cases must, have an authorized representative. See 0005.06 (Authorized Representatives) . MSA: Use vendor payments only in the following situations: At the client's or representative payee's request. When there is an emergency need and it is the most appropriate method to resolve the emergency. See 0004 (Emergencies) . To use special need funds (other than for special diets). See 0023 (Special Needs Payments) . Use protective payee payments when there is evidence that the client cannot manage income to meet necessary expenditures. Evidence includes: Not being properly fed or clothed. Repeated failure to meet obligations for rent, utilities, food, or other essentials. Repeated instances of lost or stolen war rants. The determination of representative payment by the Social Security Administration (SSA) for the client is sufficient reason f or protective payment of MSA. GA: Use alternative payment methods in the following situations: When you determine cl ients have exhibited a continuing pattern of money mismanagement, issue vendor or protective payments. EGA payments must be in the form of vouchers or vendor payments, unless you determine that a cash grant will better meet the need of the emergency situation. See 0004 (Emergencies) . When you refer a client for a chemical use assessment, or an assessment indicates the client is drug dependent. See 0012.3 0 (Chemical Use Assessment), 0024.09.12 (Payments After Chemical Use Assessment ). When clients request in writing that you issue all or part of their assistance in the form of vendor payments and you approve the request.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2020 PROTECTIVE AND VENDOR PAYMENTS- SNAP/MSA/GA/GRH 0024.09.01 GRH: Monthly payments made on an individual's behalf for group residential housing are issued as vendor payments. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 CHOOSING PROTECTIVE PAYEES 0024.09.03 MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA: You must consult with clients about selection of the form of payment, or the selection of a protective payee, and the distribution of their assistance payment. Notify the caregiver of the consultation date. If the client fails to respond to the request by the due date, select a protective payee for the client. If clients respond to the request at a later date, they retain the right to consult with the agency on the protective payee. If you have not selected a protective payee by the time benefits are to be issued, issue benefits directly to the client. Tell caregivers they may appeal use of protective or vendor payments and the selection of the protective payee. The following people may not serve as protective payees due to possible conflict of interest: Members of the county board of commissioners or welfare board. Agency workers who determine the client's eligibility or handle accounting processes related to the client. Special investigative staff. The client's landlord, g rocer, or other ve ndor. County staff members not listed above may serve as protective payees if: The county agency cannot find an appropriate person to act as protective payee. OR The county agency determines using a county staff member as protective payee is in the client's best interest.

In cases of money mismanagement, in 2 years, or the month after you determine a client no longer needs a money management pl an, whi chever occurs first, unless the client is under vendor payments due to program sanctions or drug- related activity. For program sanctions, discontinue vendor payment of rent and, if applicable, utilities 6 months after the month the particip ant complies. See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . When the vendor payment interferes with the participant's legal right to withhold rent due to a dispute with a landlord. The renter can fi le an \"Emergency Relief\" action or \"Rent Escrow\" action wh ich provides the right to withhold rent. Minnesota law also allows a renter to withhold rent, without filing an action in court, when a landlord fails to maintain the premises and all common areas fit for the intended use, keep premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease, or maintain the premises in compliance with applicable health and safety laws of the state. Upon becoming aware the housing unit is uninhabitable. No future rent payments may be made until the landlord demonstrates the premises are fit for use. Landlords cannot take eviction actions against anyone in the assistance unit. If the participant's request to cease vendor payment is questionable, contact the landlord to verify the participant is actually withholding rent payments, using a signed release of information. Vendor payment of shelter and utility costs remain in place any time a drug felon is part of the assistance unit. See 0011.27.03 (Drug Felons) . Release any unspent funds as soon as possible after you stop protective or vendor payments. Conduct a review within 30 days after a unit complains about the protective payee's performance.

On MAXIS, indicate the vendors and the amounts to be vendor paid before the cash cut -off date. Any grant amount that is not vendor paid will be paid to the participant. Do not withhold portions of the grant if you cannot identify vendors. Do not pay the non- vendored portion to a representative payee unless there is an unrelated basis for making payments to a payee, such as money mismanagement. If the client's basis of eligibility is based on drug or alcohol addiction, you must vendor pay the shelter and utilities, and issue the remainder of the benefits to the client.

County agencies may not require that clients have state ID cards. At the time of application, tell clients about the availability of photo ID cards. An oral statement of need is sufficient reason to issue an ID. Photo ID cards expire 12 months from the date of issue. Do not take the photo for the ID until you have established the client's identity according to program policy. See 0010.18 (Mandatory Verifications) . Issue a photo ID card only if the client meets the criteria above and you expect the client to receive a state warrant. Give the ID card to the client. Keep a copy of the number of ID card issued in the case file. Issue the client 1 free replacement in a 12 month period. A county which replaces cards more frequently may charge a replacement fee of no more than $2 per card. Counties may use the funds from this charge to defray their costs in the ID process. County agencies must keep a log of photo ID cards issued. For the food portion of MFIP, follow the SNAP provisions. DWP, MSA, GA: Follow MFIP, EXCEPT reference to the food portion of MFIP does not apply. SNAP: Identification cards are NOT issued for SNAP clients. SNAP benefits are accessed using an EBT card and PIN, which is acceptable identification of the SNAP client. GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2006 BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS AND RECOVERY 0025 This chapter gives information on underpayments, overpayments, and relative contributions. The information in this chapter wi ll help you determine when to issue a corrective payment, adjust benefits, or pursue overpayment recovery. See 0030.03.18 (RCA Overpayments and Underpayments) for information on Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) underpayments and overpayments. See 0008.06 (Implementing Changes - General Pr ovisions) for what might cause an overpayment or underpayment. To compute the amount of an incorrect payment, see 0025.03 (Determining Incorrect Payment Amounts) . Some programs require counties to keep records of incorrect payments. Some programs also require counties to send records of certain overpayments to Department Human Services (DHS). See 0025.06 (Maintaining Records of Incorrect Payments) , 0025.24.03 (Recovering Fraudulently Obtained Assistance ). All programs require the county agency to correct underpayments and overpayments. The procedures for accomplishing this vary. For further information, see: 0025.09 Correcting Underpayments . 0025.09.03 Wher - Time mits. 0025.15 Order of Recovery - Participants . 0025.18 Order Recovery - Non-Participants . 0026.39 Notice Recoupment . For all client error overpayments, determine if a fraud investigation is appropriate. See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) . Pursu e recovery for overpayments and relative contributions. The order and method of recovery vary depending on whether the person responsible for payment is a current participant. Financially responsible relatives who do not live with the participant may have to contribute toward the cost of assistance.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 DETERMINING INCORRECT PAYMENT AMOUNTS 0025.03 When you find a payment was incorrect, reconstruct each budget month and corresponding payment month using the policies and procedures that were in effect for the payment month. The overpayment or underpayment is the difference between the benefit amount the client actually received and the benefit amount the client should have received. Overpayments once computed must be entered on MAXIS through the CCOL/CLAM queue. See 0025.21.07 (JOL - Establishing Claims) . For overpayment notice requirements, see 0026.39 (Notice of Overpayment and Recoupment) . Enter claims you suspect are fraud claims as client error initially, and adjust them later to fraud if appr opriate. Once entered on MAXIS, initiate recovery on collectible claims. See 0025.12.06 (Repaying Overpayments - Participants) , 0025.12.09 (Repaying Over payments - Non-Participants) , 0025.24.03 (Recovering Fraudulently Obtained Assistance) . To determine if a client was overpaid, refer to other sections of this manual. For example, see 0022.21 (Income Overpayment Relating to Budget Cycle) to determine if an increase in income results in an overpayment. See 0008 (Changes in Circumstances) for information on other changes that may cause an overpayment or underpayment. When computing overpayments, allow earned income disregards and work expense deductions only for earned income reported timely. Timeliness varies between programs, see program provisions. Do not allow the earned income disregard on income reported through other means such as IEVS, a \"New Hire Message\", or a person other than the client, the authorized representative, or guardian. If a client reports only part of his/her earned income, do not allow earned income disregards on the income not reported timely. (For example, a client has 2 jobs but fails to report the 2nd job. When computing the overpayments, allow all the disregards on the earnings from the 1st job but not the 2nd job.) Also see 0018.06 (Work Expense Deductions) , 0018.18 (Earned Income Disregards) . When processing a restored benefit on a case that has a claim for the same period, ALWAY S enter the claim first. MAXIS will apply the restored benefit amount to the claim when appropriate. See TEMP Manual TE02.08.025 (Restored Benefits Applied to a Claim). Determine Discovery and Established Dates as part of the process for calculating a c laim. See DISCOVERY DATE in 0002.15 (Glossary: Deed...) , ESTABLISHED in 0002.21 (Glossary: Employment...) , TE02.09.01 (Entering Claims) . Documents need ed to calculate a claim could be wage stubs, W -2s, bank statements, employer verification, etc. Do not include any amounts in the overpayment calculation that occurred more than 6 years prior to the Discovery Date for overpayments due to client error or fraud. Do not include amounts that occurred more than 1 year prior to the Discovery Date for overpayments due to agency error. If the Discovery Date is not correctly identified it can result in monthly overpayments erroneously being included or excluded in a claim. See 0025.12.12 (Action On Overpayments - Time Limits) . MFIP: DO NOT establish an overpayment or underpayment for prospectively budgeted units for any month for which you based the assistance issued on the best information available at the time, if you applied the correct policy, and there was no client error. DO NO T establish an overpayment when a 100% sanction has not been imposed due to the agency's failure to act. See 0028.30.03 (Pre 60- Month Type/Length of ES Sanctions) . Use retrospective budgeting CONTINUOUSLY for all previously retrospectively budgeted months whether or not there were months of total ineligibility. DO NOT change budget cycles due to months of ineligibility. For purposes of allowing the earned income disregard, a report is timely when the client or authorized representative reports income within 2 calendar months following the end of the month in which the income was received. Reporting procedures and client notice requirements used when clients report timely do not apply when changes in household composition are not reported timely. When a mandatory unit member enters the household and the unit fails to report the change timely, calculate the overpayment starting with the month the mandatory unit member arrives. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 DETERMINING INCORRECT PAYMENT AMOUNTS 0025.03 When a mandatory unit member leaves the household and the unit fails t o report the change timely, if the agency could have reduced or terminated assistance for 1 or more payment months had a delay in reporting the change not occurred, determine whether timely notice could have been issued on the day that the change occurred. Determine the correct benefit amount beginning with the 1st month in which you could have given timely notice. Subtract the benefit the unit should have received for the payment month from the actual MFIP issued. Subtract the full benefit amount the unit should have received (disregard any recoupment previously deducted) from the full benefit amount the unit actually received (disregard any recoupment previously deducted) for each month in the overpayment period. The difference is the overpayment amount. NOTE: The housing subsidy deduction reduces only the cash portion of the MF IP grant. See 0017.15.99 (Housing Subsidy) . When determining the correct overpayment amount, do NOT use the housing subsidy to reduce the food portion of the benefit amount. If the client refuses to provide information to establish the amount of the overpayment and if no information is available to estimate a claim amount, assign an overpayment for the full amount of MFIP issued for the period in question. Notify the client of the right to provide proof to establish a smaller overpayment. Close the case if it is not possible to establish current eligibility. DWP: Follow general provisions. In addition, do not establish an overpayment or underpayment if the determination of the DWP grant amount is based on the best information available at the time of approval, even when there is additional income to the family unit. See 0022.12 (How to Calc. Benefit Level - MFIP/DWP/GA) . SNAP: Do not establish an overpayment or underpayment because of changes that were not required to be reported by the unit during the certification period. However, for any reported change, take appropriate action. See 0007.15.03 (Unscheduled Reporting of Changes - SNAP) . When calculating overpayments or underpayments for SNAP, use the amount of cash assistance actually received in the payment month even if the cash assistance was later determined to be an overpayment. Do not allow the work expense deduction on income not reported timely. Timely reporting means that required changes be reported by the 10th of the month following the month of the change. CALCULATING AN OVERPAYMENT Determine whether the unit IS or is NOT categoric ally eligible for SNAP : If the SNAP unit IS categorically eligible, they are subject to the budgeting provisions that were in place at the time of the overpayment. See 0013.06 (SNAP Categorical Eligibili ty/Ineligibility) , 0022.09.03 (When to Switch Budget Cycles - SNAP) . For overpayments that occurred PRIOR to 03 -01-09: If the SNAP unit is NOT categorically eligible, they must meet prospective eligibility requirements. If the overpayment is caused by unreported income, the unit remains in retrospective budgeting unless there are 2 or more consecutive months of ineligibility. If there are 2 or more consecutive months of ineligibility, the case would be presumed closed. Switch the unit to prospective budgeting and presume that the unit reapplied on the 1st day they were eligible. Calculate the amount the unit should have received based on the 1st day they were eligibl e. See 0022.03.01 (Prospective Budgeting - Program Provisions) . For overpayments that occurred ON OR AFTER 03 -01-09: Continue to budget all months prospectivel y. EXCEPTION: For Uncle Harry Food Support (UHFS) units, follow the ins tructions for determining overpayments that occurred prior to 03 -01-09. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2019 DETERMINING INCORRECT PAYMENT AMOUNTS 0025.03 If the ineligibility is caused by any reason other than unreported income, and there is 1 month or more of total ineligibility and then 1 month or more of eligibility, presume that the unit reapplied on the 1st day they were eligible. Calculate the amount the unit should have received based on the 1st day they were eligible. MSA: Follow general provisions. In addition, if the client receives SSI and SSA does not establish an overpayment or charge a partial overpayment, do not establish an MSA overpayment. For any month in which there is a total SSI overpayment, establish an MSA overpayment. If the total SSI overpayment is due to excess assets, the entire MSA benefit is an overpayment. If the total SSI overpayment is due to excess income, evaluate income to determine the amount of the MSA overpayment. Do not allow the work expense deduction on income not reported timely. See 0018. 06 (Work Expense Deductions) . For self-employment income overpayments that occurred after February 1, 2016, use the gross self -employment income calculation method for self-employment income not reported timely. See 0017.15.33.03 (Self -Employment, Convert Inc. To Monthly Amt - Cash) . When there is 1 month or more of total ineligibility and then 1 month or more of eligibility, presume that the unit reapplied on the 1st day they were eligible. Calculate the amount the unit should have received based on the 1st day of the month they were eligible. GA: Follow general provisions. For self-employment income overpayments that occurred after February 1, 2016, use the gross self -employment income calculation method for self-employment income not reported timely. See 0017.15.33.03 (Self -Employment, Convert Inc. To Monthly Amt - Cash) .

This includes : - County or tribal worker errors, MAXIS system errors or state agency errors. - Agency failing to act on known information reported by a participant or former participant . - Miscalculati ng a budget . - Incorrectly applying program policy. - Failing to act on data matches in a timely manner. To determine if an agency error overpayment should be recovered see 0025.12.03 (Overpayments Exempt From Recovery ). Client error overpayments. Consider cases suspected of fraud to be client error overpayments until a determination of fraud is made. Enter claims as non -fraud on MAXIS and adju st when appropriate. Some examples include: - Not reporting timely. - Failing to give the county or tribal agency correct or complete information. - Failing to notify the county or tribal agency of required changes. - Receiving more benefits than eligible for because of a request for an appeal hearing. - Receiving benef its from more than 1 county or state in the same month. NOTE: The continuous use of an EBT card in another state does not necessarily result in an overpayment unless there has been duplicate receipt of assistance. See TEMP Manual TE16.33 (Continuous Use of EBT Card In Another State). Fraud overpayments. Consider cases suspected of fraud to be client error overpayments until the court or an Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH) makes a determination of fraud. Consider an overpayment in any month in which a client files a false report timely and this results in an overpayment to be a client error overpayment. This applies even if there is an agency error in the same month, unless the agency caused the client's failure to report. See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) . If the county which overpaid the unit does not pursue recovery, the county the unit moves into must pursue recovery. The county the unit moves into must contact the county which made the overpayment to verify that it does not intend to pursue recovery. The county agency which recovers the overpayment retains the county agency's share of the claim. For information on when to transfer a claim, see TEMP Manual TE02.09.18 (When to Transfer a MAXIS Claim). For participants receiving benefits via electronic benefit transfer (EBT), if the overpayment is a result of an ATM dispensing funds in error to the participant, the state may recover the ATM error by immediately withdrawing funds from the participant's EBT account, up to the amount of the error. MFIP: Established AFDC/FGA claims remain AFDC/FGA claims. Do not switch them to MFIP claims. AFDC/FGA claims are recouped from MFIP. DWP: Follow general provisions. In addition, benefits are subject to overpayments and underpayments but are NOT subject to cross program recoupment. Any time an overpayment or underpayment is determined calculate the correction using prospective COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2019 TYPES OF OVERPAYMENTS 0025.12 budgeting. See 0025 (Benefit Adjustments and Recovery) . SNAP: Client error overpayment is further defined as: The unit's participation in the SNAP Program and the Food Distribution Program in the same month. An error on the part of a categorically eligible unit. Social Security Administration errors which result in a unit's categorical eligibility. County agency error is further defined as: The county agency's failure to re duce the unit's benefit when it s cash assistance changed. The county agency issuing the unit SNAP benefits after their certification period expired. The county agency overpaying SNAP due to the underpayment of a cash assistance grant that would have reduced SNAP benefits. MSA, GA: Follow general provisions. GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2019 OVERPAYMENTS EXEMPT FROM RECOVERY 0025.12.03 The court may order that all or part of an overpayment is exempt from recovery. The county must follow the court order. See 0025.12.03.06 (Bankruptcy), 0025.24.03 (Recovering Fraudulently Obtained Assistance) . MFIP, DWP: Establish a claim for all claim types and amounts. Do not pursue recovery on non- fraud overpayments on closed cases which total $35 or less. If the client begins to receive assistan ce again, recoupment will occur as long as the claim is in active status and has a balance. Use the following policy to determine if an agency error overpayment for the MFIP cash portion is collectible: Overpayments of the MFIP cash portion due to agency error should be recovered only in rare circumstances. State law directs that agency error overpayments should only be collected from the participant if the amount is large enough that a reasonable person would know it is an error. The food portion of the MFIP benefit follows SNAP policy and is subject to collection whether an agency error or client error caused the overpayment. Do not pursue recovery of an MFIP cash portion or DWP overpayment due to agency error if the agency error was made in the initial month of eligibility and continued for any amount of time. If the county or tribal human services agency has an overpayment caused by agency error that it believes should be collected from the participant , a PolicyQuest should be submitted as DHS will make the final decision based on specific circumstance of each case. See TEMP Manual TE02.09.48 (PolicyQuest Agency Overpayment Determination) . Do not enter the claim into MAXIS until the Department determines if it is collectible. SNAP: The following overpayments are exempt from recovery; do not establish a claim for overpayments due to: The county agency's failure to certify a unit in a correct project area. The county agency's failure to verify a unit signed the application. The county agency's failure to verify a unit completed a current work registration form. The unit's failure to report a change because it was not required to report the change. See 0007 (Reporting) . A categorically eligible unit later being found ineligible for cash assistance or SSI due to excess asset s. Establish a claim, even though the following overpayments are exempt from recovery when: The total overpayment is less than $35 and the unit no longer receives SNAP . An error was cited during a quality control review which resulted in an overp ayment. The county agency has documentation which shows that the unit cannot be located. See 0025.12.03.03 (Suspending or Terminating Recovery) . Do not pursue recovery on compromised portions of an overpayment . See 0025.12.03.09 (Claim Compromise & Termination) . MSA, GA: Follow MFIP.

AND The county agency determines the demand letters are no longer cost effective. The county agency sets its own policy on cost effectiveness. Counties may also reinstate system -generated demand letters if the client's circumstances change. Terminate non- fraud claims only when the client dies. GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 07/2015 BANKRUPTCY 0025.12.03.06 Immediately discontinue all recovery actions against a person who the agency learns has filed a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy action or has been granted a discharge. Notification to affected creditors only needs to be near and constructive, a legal t erm that does not demand direct notice or proof of notice to enforce the automatic stay from all recovery actions as a result of the filing or discharge. Once the bankruptcy petition is filed, an automatic stay is in place that stops lawsuits, forecl osures, garnishments, certified state or federal revenue intercepts and all other collection activity and contact with the debtor. H owever, agencies may continue recoupment against an assistance unit if 1 or more members responsible for that debt are not part of the bankruptcy action. As soon as your agency becomes aware of a bankruptcy related action involving one of its debtors, refer the matter to your county attorney or another person designated to evaluate options for respond ing to bankruptcy matters . To have any standing with respect to considering a debt for exception to discharge or to be included in a distribution of assets , your agency must formally respond to bankruptcy court. In Chapter 7 proceedings, this may consist of filing a proof of claim, if not included in the list of debts or petitioning the bankruptcy court in an adversarial proceeding with documentation supporting the non-dischargeable basis of your agency's debt. In Chapter 13 proceedings, responding may consist of sending in a proof of claim and, as appropriate, attending the meeting of creditors to be considered for any repayment against the debt from income and assets that are not reserved for higher priority payments. In bankruptcy filings, public assistance debts are classified as unsecured/non- priority claims and are routinely discharged because these debts are rarely covered in any distribution of available debtor assets. Agencies cannot require the debtor to amend the filing as a condition for stopping recovery actions or refunding payments received after the filing or discharge. Agencies may file their own Proof of Claim with the bankruptcy court and not rely on the debtor to list it. The Proof of Claim form is a standard form available through the United St ates Bankruptcy Court website. An attorney is not required to complete or certify a debt on the Proof of Claim form. An exception to having unsecured debts discharged is to establish that the debt falls within the meaning of the bankruptcy court definition of fraud or misrepresentation. The bankruptcy definition of fraud is broader and does not necessarily require proof of intent. When objecting to discharge based on fraud, your agency must file a law suit (adversarial proceeding) with the bankruptcy court that includes all the background information and basis for why the debt was incurred fraudulently. For cases involving public assistance debt that was adjudicated through the administrative disqualification hearing (ADH) process, the objection would be fairly straightforward using the information obtained to support the ADH fraud determination. Certain debts incurred as a result of client error such as failing to report information, could also be pursued as an exception to discharge based on the fraud bankruptcy definition. Debts and fines relating to restitution orders as a result of formally adjudicated criminal court convictions are non- dischargeable without having to file an objection to discharge with the bankruptcy court . Absent an order from the bankruptcy court that a debt is not discharged, any unsecured debt established against the debtor pr ior to the bankruptcy filing date is considered discharged and must be written off pursuant to the claims termination policy found in 0025.12.03.09 (Claim Compromise & Termination) . This holds true whether or not your agency was a participant or had been given timely notice in the bankruptcy process . The discharge of debts only covers debts incurred prior to the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. Debts established after the bankruptcy filing date are not dischargeable. Agencies believing that they would have sought an exception had they been properly notified of the bankruptcy should consult with their county attorney. This situation would most likely require your agency initiating a formal action with the bankruptcy court and debtor to show how the agency was prejudiced by the failure to be noti fied. When the court determines that an agenc y's debt is non -dischargeable or the bankruptcy action is dismissed without granting a discharge , resume recovery actions against that person. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 CLAIM COMPROMISE & TERMINATION 0025.12.03.09 Compromising a claim consists of accepting a partial payment as full satisfaction of a claim on the condition that the payment is received promptly. Separate policies apply to claims depending on when initial notification is received on the claim. For in formation on how to post payments to a compromised claim, see TEMP Manual TE02.09.46 (Compromising a Claim). NEW CLAIMS This policy applies to all collectible claims for which the initial notification of overpayment occurred on or after December 1, 2002. The text of all MAXIS overpayment notices issued on or after December 1, 2002, has been modified to include language that advises each debtor of: The right to have their claim compromised. AND The conditions that must be met to have their claim compromised. The time limit for a debtor to make the compromise payment is 90 days from the initial notification of the claim to the household. If the initial overpayment notice is sent by first class mail, the 90 day period begins with the date the notice is issued. If the initial notice is returned to the local agency by the postal service, the right to an overpayment notice and compromise is renewed. If the initial overpayment notice is sent by certified mail and accepted by the household, the 90 day period begins with the date a household member signs for receipt of the notice. The right to compromise does not apply when the initial notification of an overpayment occurs in conjunction with a criminal or civil court proceeding. This includes the occasion of securing a confession of judgment which also happens to be the initial notification of overpayment. None of these methods of establishing a claim, in fact, requires a MAXIS overpayment notice. If a MAXIS overpayment notice precedes any of these other actions and a timely compromise payment is received, the local agency is bound by the compromise. Consequently, a local agency that pursues criminal action would not be able to seek monetary restitution f or the full amount of a previously compromis ed claim. This does not, however, prevent a local agency from charging the full amount of a compromised claim or from requesting additional fines, penalties, interest or non- monetary restitution in the sentencing phase of the criminal proceeding. Claims are subject to compromise if voluntary payment is received within the 90- day time limit and either of the following conditions applies: Claims for excess assets may be compromised if the amount of the overpayment is greater than the amount that assets exceeded program limits. A compromise payment can be made for the amount of excess assets. If the value of excess assets changed during the period of an overpayment, the acceptable compromise payment is based upon the maximum amount assets were over prog ram limits. OR Claims for any basis may be compromised by 25% if the remaining 75% is repaid. A claim for excess assets can be compromised under this provision if this method establishes a smaller payment than the prior provision. Compromise amounts must be in the form of direct voluntary payment by a debtor. Recovery received by tax offset, recoupment, restored benefits or canceled EBT benefits cannot be applied toward a compromise. PREVIOUS CLAIMS This policy applies to claims that provided the initial notice of overpayment prior to December 1, 2002. Compromise of these claims may be done upon inquiry of the debtor to the local agency. A local agency representative may offer a compromise proposal subject to the following limitations: The compromise is based upon the account of the debtor rather than an individual claim. This account includes all existing claims for which the debtor is responsible except new claims identified in Part A, fraud claims resulting from criminal convi ction COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 CLAIM COMPROMISE & TERMINATION 0025.12.03.09 or pre -trial diversion and claims that have already been referred to the Minnesota Collection Enterprise (MCE) or the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). NOTE: In March, 2004 MCE changed its name to Collection Division of the Department of Revenue. The codes and process for debt referral will continue to be referred to as MCE on MAXIS. At least 50% of the total amount owed on the claims in the account has been repaid prior to the compromise proposal. The debtor repays 50% of the remaining balance within 90 days of the compromise proposal. All forms of recovery can be credited in determining whether a debtor meets the 50% payment requirement. CLAIM TERMINATION POLICY A claim may be terminated and the claim balance adjusted to 0 when there is no realistic prospect for future recovery. This practice differs from a write off which is an accounting mechanism to remove a claim as an accounts receivable asset even though the claim is retained against the possibility of future recovery. All terminated claims are automatically written off, but claims that are written off are not neces sarily terminated. Terminate claims when: The only responsible debtor for a claim has died and no future recovery actions are available. OR The only responsible debtor for a claim has had that debt discharged by federal bankruptcy court in a Chapt er 7 or Chapter 13 proceeding. OR A claim is the sole responsibility of a debtor who resides in a Long Term Care Facility, there is no prognosis for a return to residential living in the community and there is no estate to repay the claim or there are existing commitments to repay higher priority obligations. OR Initial notification on a claim occurred at least 10 years previous, there has been no recovery on any of the claims in the debtor's MAXIS account in the preceding 6 years, criminal restit ution is no longer required by district court, there is no docketed judgment and the debt is not certified for Revenue Recapture or the federal Treasury Offset Program (TOP) .

See 0025.21.06 (Civil Recovery) . Criminal restitution. See 0025.24 (Fraud ulently Obtaining Public Assistance) Offsetting overpayments with underpayments. See 0025.09 (Correcting Underpayments) . For additional methods of recovering overpayments from participants, see the individual programs listed below. Common methods for recovering overpayments from non- participants are: Voluntary repayment, repayment agreements, and Confessions of Judgment. See 0025.21.03 (Overpay ment Repayment Agreement) . Referral to Revenue Recapture. See 0025.21.09 (Revenue Recapture Act) . Civil recovery. See 0025.21.06 (Civil Recovery ). Criminal restitution. See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) . Contracting with a professional or private collection agency. For programs other than SNAP and the food portion of MFIP, all direct recoveries by the county (EXCEPT recoupments) qualify for retention of 50% of the non- federal share. For SNAP and the food portion of MFIP, there is a 35% federal incentive provided for fraud recoveries, 20% for household errors, and 0% for agency errors. Counties receive half of this incentive when Treasury Offset Program (TOP) recovers the money and they receive full incentive when recovery is a result of recoupment or direct payment. Do not use wage garnishment for participants. Do not use wage garnishment for non- participants until 6 months after all public assistance eligibility ends. MFIP: Also use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) as an additional method of recovery for non- participants for the MFIP Food Portion only. DWP: Follow general provisions. However, there is no cross -program recoupment. SNAP: Also use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) as an additional method of recovery for non- participants. MSA, GA: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2019 RECOVERY METHODS 0025.21 Follow general provisions. GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 06/2016 OVERPAYMENT REPAYMENT AGREEMENT 0025.21.03 An overpayment repayment agreement is a payment plan the client and the county agency agree to as a method of repaying an overpayment. Use repayment agreements with participants in the following situations: Client requests voluntarily repayment in exc ess of the recoupment amount. Fraud determination or a pretrial diversion require repayment in excess of the recoupment amount. Use repayment agreements with non- participants in the following situations: Client requests voluntary repayment. Fraud determinations. Clients may voluntarily repay the overpayment before you start other methods of recovery. The Notice of Overpayment explains this option. Overpayment repayment agreements include any of the following: A Confession of Judgment . A written agreement between the county agency and the client. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 CIVIL RECOVERY 0025.21.06 Civil recovery includes obtaining a judgment and pursuing it through garnishment, attaching property, etc. Specific procedur es for civil recovery may vary by county and are set by the county attorney or collections unit. The county may initiate civil recovery up to 6 years after the overpayment occurred. The county agency can obtain a judgment for civil recovery while a client is still receiving assistance. However, the county agency cannot pursue recovery while the per son is a participant or until 6 months after eligibility ends. See 0025.27 (Protection From Garnishment) . Once the court awards a judgment, recovery is not subject to the statute of limitations, but the county must renew the judgment every 10 years. An action to obtain a judgment must be initiated within the 6- year statute of limitations, and the county must renew the judgment every 10 years. The court -ordered repayment amount may differ from the actual overpayment because the judgment may include interest after the judgment is docketed, in which case the interest applies back to the date the judgment was obtained. The Judgment by Operation of Law (JOL) is another form of civil recovery for establishing overpayments and securing judgments on selected MAXIS claims. See 0025.21.07 (JOL - Establishing . MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA: Clients may make voluntary payments to the county while they are on or off assistance. Subtract all payments from the balance of the overpayment. When a client fails to pay, contact the county attorney immediately. The county attorney or collections unit may decide to obt ain a judgment to ensure collections after the statute of limitation expires. Do not recoup any interest the judgment accrues. The client must pay the interest separately to the county. Recoup the actual overpayment only. SNAP: If the client makes payments to the county, subtract the payments from the overpayment balance. If the judgment accrues interest, do not recoup the interest. The client must pay the interest separately to the county. GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 JOL - ESTABLISHING CLAIMS 0025.21.07 Judgment by Operation of Law (JOL) is a form of civil recovery for establishing overpayments and securing judgments on selected MAXIS claims. The JOL differs from the typical administrative process for establishing overpayment. Instead of first class m ail, the notice of overpayment must be provided by certified mail or personal service to the client. See 0026.39 (Notice of Overpayment and Recoupment) . The time period for requesting an appeal is extended to 90 days after the notice is received by certified mail or personal service. Typically, the client has 30 days from the date a regular notice of overpayment is mailed to request an appeal. See 0027.09 (Appeal Request s). With the following exceptions, the JOL process must be used for all newly established MAXIS claims: Agency error overpayments. Household error overpayments under $100. Fraud overpayments that have been established by a court order for restitution. Certified mail for the JOL process is automated for program claims managed in MAXIS. The certified notice of overpayment has special text indicating that a judgment may exist if the notice was received by certified mail or personal service. The MAXI S automated process starts when claims are loaded on MAXIS and defaults to sending certified notices of overpayment for all JOL eligible claims. See TEMP Manual TE02.09.11 (Demand Letters for Overpayments ), TE02.09.26 (CCOL/CLRA). The Issuance Operations Center (IOC) batches the certified mail notices in individual unsealed envelopes and sends them weekly to respective agencies for mailing. Each agency has a designated contact person, preferably a collection or accounting offic er responsible for recovery of MAXIS claims. That local agency contact person is responsible for obtaining and affixing a cert ified mail attachment to each envelope and forwarding them to the U.S. Postal Service for delivery. If the county/agency contact changes, the county/agency should contact the IOC with the new person's name, address, and phone number. Local agencies are r eimbursed for JOL related certified mailings. Submit claims for reimbursement to the department by completing the specified portion of page 6 of Income Maintenance Expense Report (DHS- 2550) (PDF) , which is used by local agencies to electronically submit quarterly claims for federal administrative reimbursement. Enter the quarterly amount spec ified for MAXIS certified mailings under Account 6800 - Other Eligible Federal Participation Expenditures, and Program 50, MAXIS, MAXIS Certified Mail. You can identify reimbursement for this cost on the state warrant by the coding of 60.MAXISCERTMAILR.QXXX.R.STATE in the invoice field. When the postal service returns the signed and dated certified mail signature card, the agency contact person prepares a notarized affidavit of service by certified mail. Use Affidavit of Service by Certified Mail (DHS -5290A) (PDF) . If the certified letter is returned unsigned by the post office, the contact person may arrange for personal service by the agency's process server. If notice is delivered by personal service in this way, the process server completes a notarized Affidavit of Service by Personal Service (DHS -5290B ) (PDF) . If an agency worker serves the notice of overpayment, the worker completes a notarized Affidavit of Personal Service (DHS -5290C ) (PDF) . The local agency contact person must retain the signed signature cards and affidavits of service until the claim is recorded for docketing, or it is repaid, whichever occurs earlier. See 0025.21.08 ( JOL - Docketing & Renewing) . If the JOL certified notice is not delivered and the MAXIS case is still active, the contact person must promptly notify the financial worker so that appropriate action can be taken to determine the whereabouts of the recipient. The contact person should make further attempts of certified mail delivery as is cost effective. If certified delivery is not accepted, the county should send a regular notice of overpayment by first class mail to provide the client with a regular notice of overpayment in order to ensure that the client was given their appeal and compromise rights. MFIP, DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA: Follow general provisions. GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 JOL - DOCKETING & RENEWING 0025.21.08 Overpayments established through the Judgment by Operation of Law (JOL) process can be docketed and renewed when needed. See 0025.21.07 ( JOL - Establishing Claim s). A local agency may enter a JOL for docketing 90 days after delivery of the overpayment notice or 90 days after terminating the benefits causing the overpayment, whichever occurs later. It does not prevent docketing a JOL against a person responsible on the claim who is no longer a member of the household that is subject to recoupment. If a satisfactory repayment plan can be completed in the 3 month period after recoupment ends, docketing the judgment can be further postponed as long as the debtor complies with the repayment plan. To docket a JOL, the collection or accounting officer must: 1. Complete a Notice of Entry of Judgment for the JOL, an Affidavit of Default, an Affidavit of I dentification and an Affidavit of Non-M ilitary Status. A combined affidavit can include all of these features. Use Judgment by Operation of Law Notice of Entry of Judgment and Affidavit of Default and Affidavit of Identification Affidavit of Non- Military Status (DHS -5290E) (PDF) , (Combined Affidavit of JOL Entry and Default) . 2. Send a copy of the Judgment by Operation of Law Notice of Entry of Judgment and Affidavit of Default and Affidavit of Identification Affidavit of Non- Military Status (DHS -5290E) (PDF) by first class mail to the debtor at the address where the JOL notice was received. If the debtor has since moved, mail a copy to the new address. Complete a notarized Affidavit of Service by Mail (DHS -5290D) (PDF) that the DHS -5290E has been mailed. 3. Affidavits can also be hand delivered to the debtor. Complete the appropriate Affidavit of Service by Personal Service ( DHS - 5290B ) (PDF) for a paid process server or Affidavit of Personal Service ( DHS -5290C ) (PDF) for personal service by an agency worker. 4. Route the following documents to the court administrator, making certain that you send the original documents: - The signature (green) card from the certified mail if that was the method of delivery . - The JOL overpay ment notice . - The Affidavit of Service of the initial JOL notice. (Affidavit of Service by Certified Mail (DHS -5290A) (PDF) , Affidavit of Service by Personal Service (DHS -5290B) (PDF) , or Affidavit of Personal Service (DHS -5290C) (PDF) ). - The Combined Affidavit of JOL Entry and Default. (Judgment by Operation of Law Notice of Entry of Judgment and Affidavit of Default and Affidavit of Identification Affidavit of Non- Military Status (DHS -5290E) (PDF) ). - The Affidavit of Service for Combined Affidavit of JOL Entry and Default. (Affidavit of Service by Mail (DHS -5290D) (PDF) ). - Any appeal decisions supporting the entry of this claim as a JOL. Upon completing the JOL docketing, the court administrator should provide notice to the agency that indicates: A JOL was established. The county where the judgment is docketed. The court file number. The docket n umber, if given. The docket date. The dollar amount docketed. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 JOL - DOCKETING & RENEWING 0025.21.08 After this information is received, docketing information should be entered in MAXIS. See TEMP Manual TE02.09.26.03 (CCOL/JGMT). When payment is received as partial or full satisfaction of a JOL, the agency should file a satisfaction document with the court administrator. Contact your court administrator for the correct Satisfaction of Judgment form to complete in your court distr ict. Docketed judgments that remain unsatisfied must be renewed every 10 years to remain in force. The renewal must be processed prior to the 10 year anniversary date of entry. Overpayment judgments may be renewed multiple times until satisfied. To renew a judgment that was docketed through the JOL process, local agency's collection or accounting worker must: 1. Prepare notarized notices for the court administration: - Notice of Judgment Renewal. The amount renewed must be equal to the unpaid principal balance plus the accrued unpaid interest. Use Notice of Judgment Renewal ( DHS -5290F ) (PDF) . - Affidavit of Default and Identification. This document provides information about the original judgment. It includes the amount paid, the unpaid principal balance, and the accrued unpaid interest balance. It also includes the debtor's name, address and military status. Use Affidavit of Default and Identification ( DHS -5290G ) (PDF) . 2. Send a copy of the Notice of Judgment Renewal and the Affidavit of Default and Identification by first class mail to the last known address of the debtor. Keep the original documents for filing with court administrator. Notice may also be delivered to the debtor by personal service. 3. Complete an Affidavit of Service by Mail for filing with court administration. This includes the debtor's name and address a nd provides the court with proof of service. Use Affidavit of Service by Mail ( DHS -5290H ) (PDF) . 4. Request the court administrator to renew the judgment. Include original copies of: - Notice of Judgment Renewal . - Affidavit of Defaul t and Identification . - Affidavit of Service by Mail . When the court administrator completes the renewal, the court will issue a Notice of Entry and Docketing of Judgment indicating a new entry and docketing date for the renewed amount. The court file number should be the same as the original judgment. Any questions regarding the JOL process should be addressed with the county attorney . MFIP, DWP, SNAP, MSA, GA: Follow general provisions. GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2010 REVENUE RECAPTURE ACT 0025.21.09 Counties may use revenue recapture to recover overpayments from former clients by intercepting their Minnesota income tax refunds, property tax refunds, and lottery winnings. The county does not need a judgment for recovery to intercept taxes or lottery winnings, but if it does not have one, the client has the right to ask for a hearing conducted by a Minnesota Department of Human Services referee. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 ESTATE CLAIMS 0025.21.12 MFIP, DWP, SNAP, MSA, GRH: No provisions. GA: The county agency may file a claim with a court of appropriate jurisdiction for the full amount of GA paid, without interest, against the estate on the death of any person who received GA, or on the death of the survivor of a married couple, either or both of whom received GA. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 RECOUPMENT 0025.21.15 For information on the amount of recoupment, see 0025.21.15.03 (Amount to Recoup) . Consider the unit to be participants even if recoupment reduces the benefit to $0. Do not recoup more than the actual overpayment of assistance. Do not recoup an amount greater than the mandated amount. If a client requests recoupment for a greater amount, send a monthly bill to the client for the amount that is greater than the mandated recoupment amount. See 0025.21.15.03 (Amount to Recoup) . The county agency must recoup from participants if the unit fails to pay the claim in full within 30 days of being notified of the claim. MFIP: The following provisions apply to all overpayments: For applicants with prior overpayments, begin recoupment with the 1st full month of eligibility. For agency error TANF cash overpayments incurred after August 1, 2016, only pursue recovery of collectible claims. See 0025.12.03 (Overpayments Exempt From Recovery) . Apply recouped amounts to overpayments starting with the oldest fraud AFDC, FGA, MFIP field trials, MFIP , or the oldest non- fraud AFDC, FGA, MFIP trial MFIP benefits. DO NOT recoup AFDC overpayments from an MFIP case if the adult on MFIP was a child when the AFDC overpayment occurred. MAXIS will recoup from MFIP to repay AFDC, FGA, SNAP, MFIP and MFIP field trial claims. For the order of recovery, see 0025.15 (Order of Recovery - Participants) . Do not recoup from BOTH the cash and food portions of an MFIP grant at the same time. - If the cash portion of the MFIP grant is $50 or more, recoupment will be taken from ONLY the cash portion of the grant and applied to both the cash and food portions of an MFIP claim, or to an AFDC and/or a SNAP claim . - If the cash portion of the MFIP grant is less than $50 and there is an active food claim, recoupment will be taken from ONLY the food portion of the MFIP grant and applied to the food portion of an MFIP claim or to a SNAP claim . - If there are no active food claims, and the MFIP cash portion is less than $50, recoupment will be taken from the available cash and applied to active MFIP or AFDC claim(s). Clients may have a restitution plan through court services. The diversion restitution order may acc ept recoupment as partial or full satisfaction. This restitution plan is in addition to and separate from the mandatory recoupment amount for participants and does not affect the monthly recoupment calculation. The total restitution (repayment plan and recoupment) may be more than the actual overpayment. The court will collect the amount greater than the overpayment. If an Uncle Harry case and MFIP case are both responsible for a SNAP claim, recoup from both cases at the same time, if the Uncle Harry members would have been considered mandatory unit members. If MFIP and Uncle Harry Food Support are issued via differ ent case numbers, make sure both cases are made responsible for the claim. See TEMP Manual TE13.030 (Food Support Uncle Harry Tip Sheet). Recoup from stand -alone SNAP to repay the federal food portion of MFIP claims. Do NOT recoup MFIP cash benefi ts from a household's Uncle Harry Food Support case. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 RECOUPMENT 0025.21.15 DWP: Follow only the MFIP provisions that apply to recouping CASH overpayments. There is no cross -program recoupment. SNAP: When the county agency determines there is an overpayment of benefits, it must begin recovering the overpayment through recoupment. Begin recoupment the 1st month notice requirements will allow. When there is a SNAP claim being recouped from an active MFIP case, follow the procedures in MFIP above. MSA: When the county agency determines there is an overpayment of benefits, it must begin recovering the collectible overpayment through recoupment. Begin recoupment the 1st month notice requirements will allow. Do not recoup from a personal needs allowance. See 0025.12.03 (Overpayments Exempt From Recovery) .

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 AMOUNT TO RECOUP 0025.21.15.03 MFIP: For all non- fraud overpayments that are not exempt from recovery, recoup the LESSER of these amounts: 3% of the Transitional Standard for the unit's size and composition. OR The amount of the unit's monthl y MFIP grant, subject to 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) . For fraud overpayments, recoup the lesser of these amounts: 10% of the Transitional Standard for the unit's size and composition. OR The amount of the unit's mo nthly MFIP grant, subject to the requirements in 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) . See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) for information on fraud overpayments . DWP: For all non- fraud overpayments that are not exempt from recovery, recoup the LESSER of these amounts: 3% of the DWP grant for the unit's size and composition. OR The amount of the unit's monthly DWP grant, subject to the requirements in 0025.21.15 (Recoupment) .

You may substitute a 3% recoupment rate for pre- existing fraud overpayments if your county attorney proffered that rate as part of a plea agreement in a fraud proceeding or the court specified that rate of recoupment in the sentencing order. If a court order only specifies a monthly restitution amount, do not substitute that amount for the 10% statutory recoupment rate. See 0025.12.03 (Overpayments Exempt From Recovery) for people exempt from recoupment. See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) for information on fraud overpayments. GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 TREASURY OFFSET PROGRAM 0025.21.18 The Treasury Offset Program (TOP) is a recovery system for intercepting federal income tax refunds, federal salaries, federal retirement, military salaries, federal contract payments, Black Lung Disease, RSDI, and Railroad Retirement to repay delinque nt debts owed to federal government agencies. MFIP: No provisions for the cash portion. See SNAP provisions for the MFIP food portion. DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. SNAP: To qualify for using TOP recovery, the claim must meet certain criteria. MAXIS will send a file of claims to the appropriate county contact people for review to make sure it meets the selection criteria. After county contact people have reviewed the file of claims accounts, MAXIS will submit the file to the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). FNS combines the files from all other participating states and submits them to the United States Treasury Department. For MAXIS instructions on TOP, see TEMP Manual TE02.08.121 (Treasury Offset Program), TE02.08.123 (TOP 60-Day Notice). .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 0025.24 Fraud exists when: People wil lfully or intentionally withhold, conceal, or misrepresent information to receive or attempt to receive more assistance than they are eligible for. For some programs, this includes people giving or receiving property without receiving or providing reasonable compensation. See 0015.69.06 (Improper Asset Transfers) . For purposes of establishing fraud in an Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH), an Intentional Prog ram Violation (IPV) shall consist of a willful or intentional false statement, a concealment of a fact, or a misrepresentation. See 0025.24.06.03 (Administrative Disqualification Hearing) . People pl an with or knowingly help another person to fraudulently seek or obtain assistance. Ineligible or unauthorized people knowingly redeem or transfer assistance checks, or EBT cards. Refer anyone you suspect of fraud for investigation. If you think fr aud has occurred, immediately refer the case to the county's investigator or investigative unit. Continue benefits if current eligibility exists. Do not close a case or deny benefits to people under investigation for fraud if they are otherwise eligible. You may delay notifying a client of an overpayment if the county attorney believes that it would hinder the fraud investigation. In this instance, you may wait up to the end of the quarter following the quarter of discovery to notify the client of the overpayment and begin recoupment. Disqualify people found guilty of fraud through an Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH), a court approved pre- trial diversion plan, a disqualification consent agreement, or a conviction by a court action. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) for information on disqualification procedures. MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA : EBT cardholders are prohibited from using their EBT debit card to purchase tobacco products or alcoholic beverages. Purchasing or attempting to purchase tobacco products or alcoholic beverages with an EBT debit card is considered fraud and subject to disqualification. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) for information on disqualification procedures. Disqualify MFIP families from Transition Year Child Care when all caregivers are found guilty of fraud. SNAP: Selling, or attempting to sell SNAP benefits or EBT cards is an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) and subject to fraud disqualification. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) for in formation on disqualification procedures. GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 RECOVERING FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED ASSISTANCE 0025.24.03 The county agency must pursue recovery from clients who obtain assistance fraudulently. Reconstruct each budget month and corresponding payment month. Use the policies and procedures that were in effect for the payment month. The overpayment or underpay ment is the difference between the benefit amount the client actually received before recoupment and the benefit amount the client should have received before recoupment. For more information, see 0022 (Budget ing and Benefit Determinatio n). Use the recovery methods described in 0025.15 (Order of Recovery - Participants) , 0025.18 (Order of Recovery - Non- Participants) , 0025.21 (Recovery Methods) . In addition, the court may order repayment. If any part of a county -calculated fraud overpayment is reduced, either as part of a stipulated plea agreement, in a pre- trial diversion order, or in a conviction order, reduce the fraud claim to reflect that reduction in the claim. When you reduce a fraud claim pursuant to these actions, you may establish a household error for the over -issued period or program you removed from t he fraud claim(s). Any resulting household error claim is subject to standards and procedures for administrative or civil recov ery, depending on how that claim is established. If a court finds a person not guilty of welfare fraud, you may also establish or maintain a household error claim based on the same action. A court may determine that welfare fraud has not been established or criminal intent does not ex ist, not whet her or not an overpayment occurred. A court has broad discretion to set restitution for any person convicted of welfare fraud. This is done through sentencing after a person is found guilty of welfare fraud. The amount of restitution may not be the same as the overpayment you determined. Restitution is often tied to what a court determines a person is capable of paying during the probation period. Any restitution ordered in addition to the county -determined fraud overpayment does NOT increase or otherwise affect that claim. This can include fines, penalties, accrued interest when t he amount owed is converted and docketed as a civil judgment, and the value of community service. The value of any restitution added to the fraud claim is collected and retained entirely by the court or county agency that preferred the fraud charge. If a court orders monetary restitution for an amount less than the county -determined fraud overpayment for which the person was charged and convicted, the fraud claim is ordinarily not reduced. The lower restitution is simply the amount that the court requires repaid as satisfaction of the terms of probation. If a court orders a methodology or formula for computing the fraud claim, reduce the fraud claim accordingly. In this event, the remainder of the overpayment may still be established and recovered as a household error claim by administrative or civil process. The client's total overpayment may be different from the court order. For example, if the client had a previous overpayment for a different time period, add the previous overpayment and the current overpayment to get the client's total overpayment. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 02/2015 DISQUALIFICATION FOR FRAUD 0025.24.06 Disqualify people who have fraudulently obtained assistance or committed an Intentional Program Violation (IPV). A disqualification for fraud or an IPV disqualification can be established by any of the following: Court conviction of Wrongfully Obtainin g Assistance or theft . Disqualification consent agreement. Pre-trial diversion. Administrative Disqualification Hearing ( ADH). Waiver of an ADH. Any court -ordered stay which carries with it any pro bationary or other conditions. Disqualify people determined to have fraudulently obtained assistance or committed an IPV for the following lengths of time: 12 months for the 1st offense. 24 months for the 2nd offense. Permanently for the 3rd offense. Disqualify people who have been convicted in state or federal court of making a fraudulent statement regarding residence in order to receive duplicate assistance from 2 or more states, even if they are otherwise eligible. The period of disqualification is 10 years from the date of conviction. Disqualify only the person convicted of fraud. Other unit members remain eligible. Send the client the Notice of Program Disqualification (DHS- 3134) (PDF) to disqualify the client and/or reduce or end assistance. See 0026.12.09 (Adequate Notice) , 0026.12.18 (Cash Cut -Off Notice). This disqualification is not appealable through an administrative hearing. The only method of appeal of this disqualification is through court action. Confessions of judgment are not fraud convictions, and disqualification penalties do not apply. Record conviction and disqualification information and copies of supporting documents (including conviction information) in the case file. If a disqualified person moves from 1 county to another, include disqualification information in the case referral. See 0008.06.21 (Change in County of Residence) . MFIP: People disqualified from SNAP due to fraud or an IPV are barred from receiving MFIP (cash and food) until that disqualification ends. A current DWP period of disqualification carries over to MFIP. A current WB period of disqualification carries over to MFIP. The disqualification period begins the 1st day of the month following the month in which the fraud or IPV is determined. People disqualified for fraud in another state remain disqual ified in Minnesota. A prior SNAP disqualification is treated as if it were an MFIP disqualification in determining the sequence of the offense (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) for MFIP. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 02/2015 DISQUALIFICATION FOR FRAUD 0025.24.06 WB: WB was suspended 12/ 01/2014. Any fraud disqualifications prior to 12/ 01/2014, based on this program , will remain in effect. DWP: Follow general provisions. Also: A caregiver who has been disqualified for fraud under MFIP, WB or DWP is not eligible for DWP when the caregiver is currently in a disqualification period for MFIP, WB or DWP. A SNAP disqualification does NOT carry over to DWP and a DWP disqualification does not carry over to the SNAP program. SNAP: People disqualified from MFIP due to fraud or an IPV are barred from receiving SNAP until that disqualification ends. If the IPV disqualification is due to misuse of an EBT card and it occurred while receiving MFIP, the person is NOT disqualified from receiving SNAP. Disqualifications must be initiated on the system within 45 days of the date the disqualification is ordered. Also see TEMP Manual TE02.08.129 (Entering SNAP Disqualifications). The disqualification period begins the 1st day of the month following the month in which the fraud or IPV is determined. A prior MFIP disqualification is treated as if it were a SNAP disqualification in determining the sequence of the offense (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) for SNAP. A person who makes a fraudulent statement regarding identity or residence in order to receive duplicate assistance from 2 or more states simultaneously is disqualified for 10 years from the date of establishing the IPV by a disqualification consent agreement, pre- trial diversion plan, or through the ADH process. Statements about residence include statements regarding where a person currently lives and whether a person receives SNAP benefits from another state. See 0011.06 (State Residence) . For information on entering a SNAP fraud disqualification on MAXIS, see TEMP Manual TE02.08.129 ( Entering SNAP Disqualifications). People disqualified for fraud in another state remain disqualified in Minnesota. MSA, GA: The disqualification period begins the 1st day of the month following the month in which the fraud co nviction or IPV is determined. GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2012 ADMINISTRATIVE DISQUALIFICATION HEARING 0025.24.06.03 An Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH) is a formal, impartial review by a Hearing Judge for the purpose of rendering a decision as to whether or not an individual committed an intentional program violation (IPV). An IPV is any action by an individual which is a willful or intentional false statement, a concealment of a fact or a misrepresentation, whether or not it resulted or could have resulted in receipt of additional benefits. Failure to report on a timely basis does not necessarily constitute an IPV. The criteria for establishing the IPV requires an intentional act of deception, or one taken with an appreciation or understanding of its consequences or wrongfulness and must be proven by a clear and convincing legal standard of proof. Clear and convincing proof requires more than a preponderance of the evidence but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Legally, clear and convincing is where the truth of the facts asserted is highly probable. In addition, there are also specific acts defined as IPVs that are related to program enforcement such as misuse of EBT cards and SNAP trafficking offenses. These generally constitute an IPV by the demonstrated performance of the particular act. Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH) must be initiated for individuals accused of committing an IPV when criminal charges are not being pursued. ADH procedures and requirements, EXCEPT for the notice of hearing as explained below, are the same as for appeal hearings. See 0027 (Appeals) . REFERRAL OF IPVS Resolve cases of suspected IPVs through either the criminal or ADH process, not both. Do not make concurrent referrals for prosecution and ADH. The practice of resolving an IPV first through the ADH process and then referring the same IPV for prosecution is prohibited. If a case is dismissed in court, an ADH may be pursued because the burden of proof in establishing an IPV in an ADH action is the lower \"clear and convincing\" test as opposed to the \"any reasonable doubt\" standard required in a criminal prosecution. ADH WAIVERS AND REQUESTS FOR ADH Upon identifying an IPV and determining that the ADH process will be pursued, the accused individual must be offered the opportunity to waive the appearance before a Hearing Judge and simply agree to the prescribed disqualification penalties. Initiate the ADH process by completing the Notice of Intentional Program Violation - Waiver of Administrative Disqualification Hearing (DHS -3131) (PDF) . Prepare a narrative summary of the allegations, investigative findings, and the evidence to support the findings. Someone other than the assigned case worker must also review and sign the form and find that the case facts, if proven, would justify a finding of fraud. The waiver allows the client to admit to the facts or not, with the understanding that the disqualification penalty will be imposed in either case. Present or mail the ADH Waiver to the client. In either case, allow the client up to 10 days to return the form. Waivers should not be offered when there is only a suspicion of guilt but the evidence is not convincing. If a county agency determines that it has sufficient evidence to hold a hearing and has offered the individual an opportunity to waive the hearing, the agency must then schedule a hearing if the individual requests a hearing or does not sign the wavier. Do not offer an ADH waiver if the case is being referred for prosecution nor should prosecution be suggested as a threat if the waiver is not signed. If an ADH waiver is offered it should be because the county has already determined that an ADH is appropriate and is merely offering the individual the opportunity to opt out of the actual hearing. If the client waives his/her right to a hearing, disqualify the person. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) . Clients have the right to revoke a signed waiver and request an ADH be held. This revocation must be in writing and be received by the county agency prior to the effective date of the proposed disqualification or within 30 days of the date the waiver was signed, whichever is earlier. If the client refuses to sign the waiver, requests to have a hearing, or fails to return the waiver, refer the case for an ADH. Complete the Request for Administrative Disqualification Hearing (DHS -3132) (PDF) and send to: COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2012 ADMINISTRATIVE DISQUALIFICATION HEARING 0025.24.06.03 Minnesota Department of Human Services Appeals Office P.O. Box 64941 St. Paul, MN 55164- 0941 Upon receipt of the Request for Administrative Disqualification Hearing (DHS -3132) (PDF) , the Office of Appeals will either accept or deny the request. If denied, the county agency will receive a notice indicating the reason for the denial. Denied reques ts may be resubmitted to the Office of Appeals for reevaluatio n. ADH requests may be withdrawn anytime before the scheduled hearing date with written notice to both the client and the Office of Appeals. If the Office of Appeals accepts a request it will schedule a hearing date and send the client and county agency a notice of hearing. The notice will include a copy of the summary prepared by the county agency. Federal regulations require the Office of Appeals to give notice of an ADH hearing at least 30 days in advance (unless the client waives the hearing), rather than the 5- day notice for a regular fair hearing. A judge may combine a fair hearing and ADH into a single hearing if the factual issues arise out of the same or related circumstances. The client must receive 30 days advance notice (unless waived) that the hearings will be combined. Within 90 days of client notification of an ADH or a combined hearing, the Office of Appeals must conduct the hearing, reach a decision, and notify the client and county agency of the decision. Unlike fair hearings, asking the appeals office to reconsider their decision is not an option. If either party disagrees with the Judge's decision, they may start an appeal in district court. This is a separate legal proceeding that must start within 30 days of the date of the deci sion. People found guilty of fraud by an ADH determination are subject to the disqualification procedures in 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) . ADH INVESTIGATIVE SUBPOENA Subpoena authority is av ailable to county agencies for gathering information in the investigative stage necessary to develop a basis for establishing and proving an IPV that will be pursued through the ADH process. Consider using an investigative subpoena when a third party refuses to provide information. Complete the Request for Investigative Subpoena (DHS- 3436) (PDF) form and send to the DHS Appeals and Regulations Division. Include a description of the information being requested and the relevance of the information to establishing the IPV. These subpoenas are not self -enforcing in that a first refusal to obey will not result in a contempt citation. However, these subpoenas are enforceable by appealing to district court for their enforcement by issue of a district court subpoena. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 DISQUALIFICATION FOR ILLEGAL USE OF SNAP 0025.24.07 MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. SNAP: Disqualify a person for 2 years the 1st time a court finds the participant has purchased illegal drugs with SNAP. Disqualify the client permanently for a 2nd such finding. Permanently disqualify a person if a court finds the participant purchased firearms, ammunition, or explosives with SNAP. Permanently disqualify a person if a court finds that person bought or sold SNAP benefits for cash or other consideration having a value of $500 or more. Also see 0005.06.03 (Who Can/Cannot Be Authorized Representatives) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 03/2015 SNAP ELECTRONIC DISQUALIFIED RECIPIENT SYSTEM 0025.24.08 MFIP, SNAP: The National SNAP Fraud Electronic Disqualified Recipient System (eDRS) is a system run by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). It tracks clients who have been disqualified from SNAP across the nation for violating SNAP program rules. DHS wi ll process a monthly match for clients who are receiving SNAP in Minnesota but who may be disqualified from receiving SNAP due to a fraud disqualification in another state. Case workers will receive notification of this disqualification through an email f rom DHS Program Integrity Staff. For both open and closed cases, follow the steps outlined in TEMP Manual TE02.08.127 ( SNAP eDRS ). These steps need to be completed so the client will not receive any food benefits they are not eligible for in the future. DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 PROTECTION FROM GARNISHMENT 0025.27 Participants of cash assistance and SNAP are protected from having their assistance benefits or wages garnished. This protection extends for 6 months after eligibility for assistance ends The data practices law prevents public agencies from releasing information about eligibility, including the date assistance was lost, to private creditors without client authorization. If a client solicits an affirmation of protection after being threatened with an attachment action, give the client a letter upon reques t. County agencies may advance the date for action to obtain enforcement on judgments for public assistance overpayments when repayment agreements are not established or a debtor becomes delinquent on a payment plan. County agencies may initiate attachment actions against clients with overpayments who lost public assistance eligibility at least 6 months previously. MFIP, DWP, SNAP , MSA, GA, GRH: F ollow general provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, PEOPLE NOT IN HOME 0025.30 As a condition of receiving assistance, clients must cooperate in trying to get support from financially responsible people not in the home. Do not withhold any part of a client's benefits because financially responsible people refuse to contribute. MFIP, DWP: Non-custodial parents, some parents of unemancipated minor caregivers, and some sponsors of immigrants are financially responsible to contribute to the unit. Refer non -custodial parents of minor children to the county agency IV -D unit. The IV -D unit will determine, together with existing court orders, the amount of support the non- custodial parents must contribute. NOTE: Married parents who are currently serving in the military away from home are considered to be custodial parents. Do not refer to IV -D when there is no breakdown in the marital relationship. See TEMP Manual TE02.10.90 (Military Families Receiving FS, MFIP or DWP) for MAXIS workarounds. The county agency IV -A section computes the contribution amount for an unemancipated minor caregiver's parents who do not live with the child, according to the instructions in 0025.30.03 (Contributions From Parents Not in Home) . (This provision does not apply to minor caregivers' parents who receive MFIP, SSI, MA, MSA, or GA, unless there is an existing court order for support.). Notify the parent to send the payment to the minor caregiver or to the county agency. See 0026.24 (Notice of Relative Contribution) . Contributions the minor caregiver receives are unearned income. If IV-D action had already been brought against a non- custodial parent of a minor c aregiver, IV -D must continue action to enforce support and obtain recovery. To determine if a sponsor must contribute to the unit, see 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration Status) , 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0015.48.03 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsors W/I -864), 0015.48.06 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsors W/I -134), 0016. 21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134), 0016.21.03 (Income of Sponsors of LPRs With I - 864). SNAP: Sponsors of some immigrants must contribute to the sponsored person. To determine if and how much sponsors must contribute, see 0011.03 (Citizenship and Immigration Status) , 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0015.48.03 (Whose Assets to Consider - Sponsors W/I -864), 0016.21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134), 0016.21.03 (Income of Sponsors of LPRs With I - 864). MSA: Follow SNAP. GA: Follow MFIP with the following EXCEPTION: Although sponsors of immigrants who do not live with the immigrant are financially responsible for the person, count only income and assets they actually contribute to the immigrant's household for sponsors who executed the I -134 (Affidavit of Support). See 0015.48 (Whose Assets to Consider) , 0016.21 (Income of Sponsors of Immigrants With I -134), 0025.30.03 (Contributions From Parents Not in Home) . GRH: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARENTS NOT IN HOME 0025.30.03 MFIP, GA: Do not require a contribution from legal guardians. Do not determine parental contributions for parents who have an existing court order for support in place. The non- custodial parent's financial contribution for the child(ren) is being met by the child support obligation so no parental contribution is necessary. Determine parental contribution amounts for a minor caregiver's parents who are not living with the minor caregiver. This provision does not apply to emancipated minors. For parents who live with the minor caregiver, see 0016.18 (Income of Inel. Parent/Guard. of Minor Crgvr) . The minor caregiver must cooperate in trying to get support from his/her parent(s). Do not withhold benefits because a minor caregiver's parents refuse to cooperate. Refer a minor caregiver's parent who does not cooperate to the county attorney. To determine the amount a minor caregiver's parents must pay when the minor is not living with the parent: 1. Request the following information from the parent(s): The amount of earned and unearned income for the previous tax year. The current month's income amount. The names of each dependent the minor's parent could claim on federal income taxes. The am ount of annual medical bills the person pays. The amount of annual housing costs the person pays. The amount of utility and home repair costs the person pays. The amount of annual educational costs the person pays for family members. 2. Deter mine income: a. Determine the gross income of the parent. Follow the same method as for units with income. See 0017 (Determining Gross Income) . b. Determine family size. Count each person who the minor' s parent claims or could claim as a dependent on federal income tax forms. Do not count the minor caregiver and his/her children. c. Combine the family's medical, educational, and housing costs. If the combined costs exceed 30% of the gross income, deduct the amount in excess of 30% from the gross income. This is the net income. 3. Compare the minor caregiver's parent's net income to the following scale: Family Size Net Income 1 $ 9,288 2 $12,432 3 $15,576 4 $18,720 5 $21,864 Add $3,144 for each additional family member. The parent's required annual contribution is 1/3 of the income that exceeds the amounts above. See 0026.24 (Notice of COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2016 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARENTS NOT IN HOME 0025.30.03 Relative Contribution) . 4. Review the minor caregiver's parent's income annually or when the person reports a change. DWP, SNAP , MSA, GRH: No provisions.

MSA, GA, GRH: A 5-day notice is timely if the agency verifies it should reduce, suspend, or terminate benefits because of probable fraud by the participant. See 0025.24 (Fraudulently Obtaining Public Assistance) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 ADEQUATE NOTICE 0026.12.09 Adequate notice of a change, termination, or suspension is notice you issue no later than the effective date of the action. Give adequate, rather than 10- day, notice of a change in these situations: An approval of assistance or an increase in benefits. The client is eligible for the approved or increased benefits even without advance notice of the action. A client submits a signed Household Report Form (HRF) , Combined Six -Month Report (CSR) or Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations (or a signed Combined Application Form (CAF) at recertification) with information requiring a change that you can determine solely from the HRF , CSR , Combined Annual Renewal for Certain Populations or the CAF. Do not use adequate notice to reduce benefits or terminate a program when the client completes a CAF to apply for a new program and the on- going program is not due for recertification. See 0026.06 (Notice - Approval of Application or Recert.) , 0026.15 (Notice of Denial, Termination, or Suspension) .

SNAP: Give adequate notice when: A unit moves out of state. Notify the unit of termination no later than the date they would receive the next allotment. Do not delay the termination to provide advance notice. If the unit has already moved, you do not need to send a notice. A unit makes a request in writing or in the presence of a financial worker to end their SNAP . In this case, the notice is a letter to the unit confirming the termination of benefits. The letter does not entitle the unit to the same rights as a notice of adverse action. It does give the unit the right to a fair hearing. If the request to end benefits is not in writing or in the presence of a financial worker, you must send a 10- day notice. You disqualify a person from SNAP and/or reduce or terminate the grant due to a fraud conviction by the court, an ADH, a court approved pre- trial diversion plan, or a disqualification consent agreement. This is true whether or not the date set by a court allows for advance notice. Send the client the Notice of Program Disqualification (DHS- 3134) (PDF) to take the action in addition to the MAXIS generated adequate notice. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) . This action is not appealable. However, if a client wishes to appeal, forward the appeal request to the DHS Appeals Office. See 0027.03 (Appealable Issues) .

If you locate the partici pant before the end of the period for which you issued the benefit, give the participant the benefit. You disqualify a person from MSA and/or reduce or terminate the grant due to a fraud conviction by the court, an ADH, a court approved pre- trial diver sion plan, or a disqualification consent agreement. This is true whether or not the date set by the court allows for advance notice. Send the client the Notice of Program Disquali fication (DHS -3134) (PDF) to take the action in addition to the MAXIS -generated adequate notice. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) . GA: Give adequate notice when: A participant dies. A participant asks in writing to end assistance. Evaluate the reason for the termination and determine if an overpayment exists. See 0025.03 (Determining Incorrect Payment Amounts) , 0026.15 (Notice of Denial, Termination, or Suspension) . The payee dies and no other relative will be payee. A participant enters an institution where the participant will be ineligible for assista nce. See 0014.09 (Assistance Units - Temporary Absence) . You process the application during the month of application and the client is eligible only for that month. See 0026.15 (Notice of Denial, Termination, or Suspension) . The post office returns a participant's mail and the county agency cannot locate the participant. If you find the participan t before the end of the period for which you issued the benefit, give the participant the benefit. A person is disqualified from this program and/or the grant is reduced or terminated due to a fraud conviction by the court o r an Administrative Disqualification Hearing. This is true whether or not the date a court sets allows for advance notice. Send the client the Notice of Program Disqualification (DHS -3134) (PDF) as well as the MAXIS generated adequate notice. See 0025.24.06 (Disqualification for Fraud) . A participant verifies that a member of the unit is absent from the home and does not meet temporary absence provisions. See 0014.09 (Assistance Units - Temporary Absence) . A court removes a GA eligible child from an MFIP household. You reinstate eligibility for a unit you terminated for failure to provide an HRF, you receive a complete HRF in the calendar month after the month the HRF was due, and the unit is otherwise eligible. See (0007.03.06 (Processing a Late HRF) . GRH: Follow general provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 1 2/2014 WHEN NOT TO GIVE ADDITIONAL N OTICE 0026.12.12 County agencies do not have to give additional notice before acting when a client loses an appeal. The original notice and t he appeal decision are the client's notice. MFIP, DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: Follow general provisions. SNAP: County agencies do not have to give additional notice in these circumstances: A client's benefit levels decrease in the second month of participation and the client was notified of this at certification. Clients apply for cash assistance and SNAP on the same CAF, and receive SNAP pending the approval of cash assistance. Notify clients at certification that their SNAP benefits will decrease if the county agency approves cash assistance. The agency certifies clients on an expedited basis and post pones verifications. See 0004.1 5 (Emergencies - Postponed Verification Notice) . Notify clients at certification that their SNAP benefits will be terminated if they fail to provide postponed verifications. The agency begins recoupment after cli ents fail to make agreed upon repaymen ts, and do not negotiate a new repayment schedule. See 0025.15 (Order of Recovery - Participants) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 WHEN TO GIVE RETROACTIVE OR NO NOTICE 0026.12.15 See specific program provisions below for when you may take action without giving notice and when you may send notice that yo u are taking action retroactively.

The Human Services judge recommends an order to the commissioner designee, who then issues an order affirming, reversing, or modifying the action of the agency or DHS. If the commissioner designee disagrees with the Human Services judge's recommendation, each party has 10 days to present additional writ ten arguments. The commissioner designee then issues a decision. The client or the county agency may ask the commissioner designee to reconsider within 30 days after the date the commissioner designee issues the order. A request to reconsider should state the reason(s) the dissatisfied party believes the original order is incorrect. The commissioner designee may reconsider an order upon request of either party or on the commissioner designee's own motion, and will then issue an amended order or an order affirming the original order. The original order takes effect even if there is a request to reconsider. The client or the county agency may also appeal to district court within 30 days after the date the commissioner designee iss ues, amends, or affirms an order. Either party may also appeal to district court to enforce an appeal decision. The commissioner designee can order that the client receive benefits during the entire time of appeal.

MAXIS/WO RKFORCE ONE PROCESS: Referral to Employment Services will not occur automatically. The worker must trigger the referral based on county policy. A case -level panel called WORK exists in MAXIS to transmit electronic referrals to Employment Services. When MAXIS creates pending eligibility results for DWP, a DAIL message will be created to inform the financial worker (FW) to refer a DWP partic ipant to Employment Services. From the WORK panel, the FW will select an ES provider to refer the job seeker to. T he WORK panel also allows the FW to indicate the date of an appointment with Employment Services as well as a place for worker comments. I n 2-parent households, both parents will be referred to Employment Services from the same, case level WORK panel. MAXIS functionality allows a FW to refer a job seeker to Employment Services before all required verifications have been received. Counties should establish a county -wide policy to address these \"early DWP referrals\". If a county approves \"early DWP referrals\", the FW can navigate to the WORK panel directly rather than waiting for the DAIL message. If the case has not been referred and the participant has not developed and signed an Employment Plan, the case can not be opened. SNAP: See 0028.03.01 (County Agency SNAP E&T Responsibilities) .

For information on participation requirements for Employment Services, see the program provisions below. Also see 0028.06.03 (Who Must Participate in Empl. Services/SNAP E&T) . MFIP: All MFIP caregivers receiving assistance MUST engage in Employment Services, including MFIP caregivers who are disqualified effective 10-1- 07 or later due to an intentional program violation, unless they meet the exemption criteria as specified in 0028.06.02 (Universal Participation Provisions) . DWP: All eligible caregivers are required to participate in Employment Services. A 1-parent household that includes a child under 12 months (with no other DWP exclusion reason) which has already used 12 months lifetime ES exemption limit must participate in ES services. A 2-parent household that includes a child under 12 months, with no other DWP exclusion reason, must participate in DWP. However, if the parents have NOT already used the entire 12 months lifetime limit between them while previously on MFIP or DWP, 1 -parent is allowed to claim the child under 12 months ES exemption. SNAP: At the time the county agency notifies the household that it is eligible for SNAP , it must notify all time-limited participants subject to work provisions that they can volunteer to participate with the SNAP E&T program each month, and that the participant must attend an orientation if they volunteer . Some people are required to register for work even though participating in SNAP E&T is voluntary . See 0028.06.12 (Who Is Exempt From SNAP Work Registration) . MSA, GA, GR H: No provisions. .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION PROVISIONS 0028.06.02 MFIP: Universal Participation requires all caregivers receiving assistance and caregivers disqualified due to an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) to engage in Employment Services (ES), with the exception of participants with a birth child under the age of 12 months regardless if the child's needs are included in the grant. NOTE: The participation requirements for caregivers disqualified due to an IPV apply only to caregivers disqualified effective 10- 1-07 or later. CHILD UNDER 12 MONTHS ES EXEMPTION Under the law there is a time- limited ES exemption for MFIP and DWP caregivers with a birth child under 12 months. The child under 12 -month ES exemption does not apply under employed extension. The 1st month of an ES exemption begins the month after the month that the participant claims the child under 12 months exemption. The 3 periods for which an ES exemption for the care of a child under the age of 12 months could have been or can be claimed are: The original child under age 1 exemption that was in effect from January 1, 1998 through June 30, 2004. The child under 12 weeks ES exception that was in effect from July 1, 2004 through February 28, 2010. Do not count more than a total of 3 months for any participant who used the 12 week exception during this period. The child under 12 months ES exemption effective March 1, 2010. All months used on DWP and MFIP under any of these periods count toward the 12- month lifetime limit for a househol d. MFIP parents who have not used a total of 12 months of the exemption (up to 12 months combined total per household for a 2- parent family) may choose to use the remaining months. Parents are allowed to choose to claim the exemption for more than 1 child, and in different spans of time. This ES exemption applies even if the child's needs are not included in the grant, such as for a child that is ineligible for cash due to receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Parents whose needs are not included in the grant (SSI, non-citizens or removed post -60) are not subject to ES participation and should not be coded as using the child under 12-month exemption to Employment Services. In a 1- parent household, the ES exemption for the care of a child under the age of 12 months is available for a cumulative 12 months lifetime limit . In a 2- parent household, the parents' exemption usage is combined to determine the 12 months total rather than being available in full to each caregiver. The 12 months are clocked separately for each parent and follow the parent that uses them. Only 1 parent is allowed to claim the exemption in any 1 month but the exemption can switch between parents from month to month. If a parent in a 2- parent unit moves out and joins a 1- parent assistance unit to form a new 2- parent assistance unit, the newly formed unit is limited to 12 months total when the 2 parents' exemption months are added together. If the combined months of the new unit exceed 12 months, they would not be eligible for any more exempt months as long as they live together. The ES exemption for the care of a child under 12 months ends at the earliest of the following dates: The 1st day of the month after the month the child reaches 12 months of age. OR The 1st day of the month after the parent uses the last month of the lifetime exemption. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 10/2019 UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION PROVISIONS 0028.06.02 OR The 1st day of the month after the specific number of months of the lifetime limit the parent chose to use. TEEN PARENTS The ES exemption to care for a child under the age of 12 months is NOT available to minor parents under age 18, or 18 - or 19 - year old parents without a high school diploma or its equivalent and who choose an employment plan with an education option. Such parents may choose to claim a 6- week exemption from attending school to care for a child under 6 weeks. However, 18 - or 19- year-old parents without a high school diploma or its equivalent who choose an employment plan with a work option may choose to claim the child under 12 months ES exemption. DWP: All caregivers eligible for DWP are required to participate in Employment Services except in the following 2 situations: A 1-parent household that includes a child under the age of 12 months (with no other DWP exclusion reason) is NOT eligible for DWP unless the parent has already used all the 12 months lifetime ES exemption. Such cases should be converted to MFIP. A 2-parent household that includes a child under the age of 12 months, with no other DWP exclusion reason, MUST participate in D WP. If the parents have NOT already used all of the months of the 12- month lifetime limit between them while previously on MFIP or DWP, 1 -parent in any 1 month, is allowed to claim the child under 12 months ES exemption.

MFIP: In the first 60 months of MFIP eligibility all caregivers are required to participate in Employment Services (ES). Some caregivers will have a different level of participation which is dependent upon their circumstances.

Refer the minor caregiver to the county social worker or the agency with whom your county has contracted to provide minor caregiver services. FAMILIES HEADED BY AN 18 - OR 19-YEAR OLD PARENT WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIP LOMA OR GED Counties must allow 18- and 19- year old teen parents who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent to choose an EP with either an education option or a work option. The work option means the EP includes activities under the regular employment services track. The 60- month clock DOES NOT stop for teen parents who choose this option. Under this option earned income DOES count for teens who choose the employment option. The education option means that the EP includes education requirements (high school or its equivalent). The 60- month clock STOPS for teen parents who choose this option. Plans that include both secondary school attendance and work fall under this option. Under this option income IS NOT counted toward the MFIP grant. County and Employment Services staff working with 18- and 19- year old parents must explain the option and make specific efforts to inform those who are in sanction for not attending school that there is a way to come into compliance. Caregivers 18 and 19 years old who choose employment will be federally funded. Also see 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 20) .

SNAP: Federal regulations require that all non-exempt adult SNAP recipients register for work. In Minnesota, work registration is automatically accomplished when a unit member signs the Combined Application Form (CAF) when applying for the SNAP program. The adult who signs the CAF registers all adults in the SNAP unit who are required to register for work. A recipient's work registration exemption status must be redetermined at least annually, and must be coded on the MAXIS system. The state then reports to the federal government the number of recipients who are exempt from work registration and the number who are not exempt. The federal government uses this information to determine the amount of federal funding Minnesota receives for SNAP E&T services. Although work registration is not a component of the SNAP E&T program (it is a national SNAP program requirement), there is a close relationship between work registration and SNAP E&T participation. SNAP recipients who are exempt from work registration are also exempt from SNAP E&T participation . See 0028.06.03 (Who Must Participate in Empl. 0028.06.10 (Who Is Exempt From SNAP E&T) . However, some people are required to register for work even though they are exempt from participating in SNAP E&T. Recipients meeting a work registration exemption for part of a month, are considered exempt for the entire month. When a recipient no longer qualifies for the exemption, unless specified differently below, remove the exemption the next month. Receiving cash programs is not a work registration exemption. Persons applying for or receiving cash must be assessed for exemptions. See below for specific program requirements. The following people are exempt from SNAP work registration: Unfit for Employment is defined as someone physically or mentally unable, or is limited. to obtain or retain employment.

Professional certification means a statement about a person's illness, injury, or incapacity that is signed by a Qualified Professional with training and experience to diagnose and to certify the person's condition. NOTE: Being an applicant for disability benefits does not automatically qualify a person as unfit for employment. Use a signed statement from a qualified professional to determine unfitness for work. - Persons who have an injury that is observed or if information about a surgery or recuperation of a surgery is provided by the client .

The caregiver must be enrolled in a secondary school and meeting the school's attendance requirements. For caregivers under 18 years of age, who are enrolled in an on- line secondary school or GED program, refer to the school district to determine its legitimacy. Each district has a transfer specialist who will sort this out, probably by doing testing. Consider a caregiver to be attending school when he or she is enrolled but the school is not in regular session (for example, during holidays and summer breaks). At the intake interview, give caregivers under age 20 the Graduat e to Independence/MFIP Teen Parent Informational Brochure (DHS -2887) (PDF) and the Notice of Requirement to Attend School (DHS- 2961) (PDF). For an 18- or 19- year old caregiver with an on- line diploma from a program other than one approved by the MN Dept. of Education, explain the MFIP policy and place the teen in the \"work option\". See 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 20) . Counties must allow 18- and 19- year old teen parents who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent to choose an Employment Plan (EP) with either an education option or a work option.

The caregiver is needed in the home because of the professionally certified illness or disabili ty of another member of the assistance unit, a relative or who is a foster child in the household. The caregiver is the parent of a child who is younger than 6 weeks old. When you deny an exemption, send a SPEC/LETR of exemption denial to the caregi ver. If a caregiver who is not exempt from school requirements fails to attend school, without good cause, impose a sanction. See 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non- Compliance--MFIP/DWP) , 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . Social Services will notify you if they determine that education is inappropriate for a custodial parent under age 18. Do not impose any other school attendance requirements unless Social Services notifies you to do so. Caregivers who are required to attend school must meet enrollment and attendance requirements. Verify enrollment and attendance information at least monthly. Have the client sign the Request for Verification of School Attendance/Progress (DHS - 2883) (PDF) or a county version of the form that contains the same information and send it to the school. Do not sanction the parent if the school fails to cooperate. Caregivers must meet enrollment and attendance requirements at the time of verification. If the school verification shows that a client is not enrolled or attending school, or appears to be facing barriers to completing education, notify the person responsible for case management and reassess the client's school attendance requirement.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS 0028.12 SNAP: BASIC EDUCATION/GED PARTICIPATION When participants enter the program, the Employment Services Provider (ESP) must assess the participants to determine if the participants can find a job with the skills they possess. If the lack of basic education is a barrier to obtaining suitable employment, the ESP may include basic education or GED course work in the EDP. Examples of when to include basic education or GED course work in an EDP include: GED course work or basic education is considered the best path to employment. Low skill levels make it difficult to complete job applications; interfere with the ability to get, keep, or advance on the j ob; or block movement toward self -sufficiency. The participant is very close (1 to 3 months) to completing a GED at the time of the individualized assessment. Prior to including basic education in an EDP, the ESP should consider: The participant's interest and motivation to be in scho ol. The participant's history of participation and progress in similar educational activities. Whether there is a reasonable expectation that the participant will make sufficient improvement in a short time to noticeably increase his/her marketabilit y. Any intellectual impairments or learning disabilities which may indicate the need for more specialized services. The ESP should approve basic education in blocks of 3 months or less to allow for a review of progress prior to continuation of the activi ty. POST-SECONDARY TRAINING/EDUCATION Post-secondary training and education activities may be included in an EDP and are generally limited to 1 year. A 2nd year may be approved in limited circumstances. In order for a post -secondary education program to be approved, the participant or the provider must document that: The goals in the participant's EDP can only be met with the post -secondary training. There is a market for full -time employees with the proposed training where the participant will (or is willing to) reside upon completion of the program. The ave rage wage level for employees with this training is significantly greater than the participant can earn without this training. The participant can meet the requirements for admission into the program. There is a reasonable expectation that t he part icipant will complete the training program based on such factors as the participant's current assessment; previous education, training, and work history; current motivation; and changes in previous circumstances. The ESP must ensure that the participant is making satisfactory progress in the program. Satisfactory progress must be defined COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS 0028.12 in the participant's EDP. The ESP may accept or modify the definition of satisfactory progress used by the educational insti tution where the participant is enrolled. MSA, GRH: No provisions. GA: No provisions. However, some people are required to attend school to get or maintain GA eligibility. See 0011.18 (Students) . .COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2019 EMPLOYMENT PLAN (EP) 0028.15 MFIP: An Employment Plan (EP) is a social contract between the county/ES provider and each participant. The purpose of these plans is to identify for each participant the most direct path to unsubsidized employment and any subsequent steps that support long- term economic stability. All MFIP participants: Are mandatory ES participants. AND Must develop an EP, unless they: - Have a child under 12 months. AND - Have any remaining months of the child under 12 months ES exemption. AND - Choose to use any remaining months of the child under 12 mon ths ES exemption. AND Must comply with the EP if an EP is developed . Employment Plans are based on information gathered during the assessment process and throughout participation in the program. Development of a basic EP should begin during the 1st meeting with a job counselor, or shortly thereafter. The EP is a living document that should be reviewed at least every 3 months and revised whenever necessary. Failure on the part of a participant to develop or comply with hourly requirements in a plan may result in a sanction. See Employment Services Manual Appendix H (FSS Sanction Guidance). Failure to sign an Employment Plan is considered failure to develop an EP and should result in a sanction. If the participant qualifies under Family Stabilization Services pre -sanction provisions apply. All EPs must be reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether activities and hourly requirements should be revised or not: Non-FSS employment plans every 3 months. FSS employment plans every 6 months. Sanction participants if they fail to develop or follow the terms of the Employment Plan. See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . There are special provisions for victims of family violence and self -employed participants. See below. VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE Victims of family violence who want to claim a Family Violence Waiver and be exempt from the 6 0-month time limit must develop and comply with an EP. The EP is developed with the assistance and collaboration of the participant, a person trained in domestic violence and a job counselor. MFIP child care is available for all activities included in an approved EP. See 0005.12.12.09 (Family Violence Provisions/Referrals) . See PERSON TRAINED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE in 0002.49 (Glossary: Permanent...) . Victims of family violence who have or are in the process of developing an EP cannot be required to attend an overview done in a group setting. The job counselor must discuss the information normally presented in the ES Over view at the time the EP is de veloped, unless the client previously attended an Overview. See 0028.09 (ES Overview/SNAP E&T Orientation) . If you combine the Financial Orientation and ES Overview, do not sanction the participant for failing to attend the regular ES Overview components of the meeting. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2019 EMPLOYMENT PLAN (EP) 0028.15 The job counselor has final approval of an EP or any revisions to the plan. If the job counselor does not approve activities in the plan, the county must provide written reason why the activities are not approved and document how the denial of these activities does not interfere with the safety of the client or children. If the client fails to cooperate with the EP the 60 -month time limit exemption ends and the client must be invited in to develop a new Employment Plan. See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) . Employment plans for participants with family violence waivers must be reviewed every 6 months. SELF-EMPLOYMENT Self-employment activities may be included in an Employment Plan (EP) contingent on the development of a business plan. All participants should be encouraged to look for employment that will lead to their self sufficiency. Participants with an approved EP that includes self -employment must meet the participation requirements. Only the hours the participant earns the federal minimum wage count toward the participation requirements. The number of self -employment hours is determined by dividing the net self -employment income by the federal minimum wage. When the number of self -employment hours is less than the number of hours required for the participant to be included in the numerator, the participant's EP should be revised to include addi tional countable activities, such as job search, paid employment, or unpaid work experience. DWP: Follow MFIP. Before issuing DWP benefits to a family unit, the caregiver or caregivers must, in conjunction with a job counselor, develop and sign an EP. Also, activities in EPs must not cover a period of more than 4 months. The purpose of the EP is to identify the most direct path to unsubsidized employment for each participant within the 4- month DWP period. The EP must clearly outline the commitments on the part of both the county/Employment Services provider and the participant . The activities in the EP must focus on obtaining the necessary evaluation, medical assessment and/or documentation if a DWP participant believes he/she may meet 1 of the DWP unlikely to benefit categories. The job counselor or county must assist the DWP participant in gathering this information. DEVELOPING AN EP AS PART OF THE DWP APPLICATION PROCESS A DWP applicant must meet with an employment counselor to develop and sign an initial EP before issuing any DWP benefits to or on behalf of the family. The employment counselor and applicant have 10 working days from the date he/she is referred to Employment Services to develop and sign the initial EP. The ES provider has 1 working day to notify the county that the job seeker's initial EP was signed. On ce notified, the county has 1 working day to issue the DWP benefits. DWP benefits cannot be issued until the initial EP is signed. When the EP is not signed within 30 days of the application date, the ES provider must notify the county. The applicant must submit a new application for DWP benefits and the time lines will start over. If the initial EP was not developed and signed within 30 days of the original application due to county or Employment Services agency error, issue DWP benefits based on the original application date. The requirement that the participant signs the EP before benefits are issued still applies to these situat ions. In most cases, the EP should include 35 hours of work or work- related activities per week. If fewer hours are included in the EP, the reasons for reducing the hours should be noted. A more limited initial EP can be developed to meet the 10- day requirement provided that a date at which the EP will be revised is included. Because DWP is limited to 4 months, the initial EP should be revised as soon as possible. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR 2 -PARENT FAMILIES In 2-parent families where only 1 caregiver meets a DWP exclusion category and the other caregiver does NOT meet a DWP COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 09/2019 EMPLOYMENT PLAN (EP) 0028.15 exclusion category, BOTH parents must participate in DWP. However, the EP for the caregiver who would otherwise be excluded will be developed taking into account the participant's special circumstances. This includes a caregiver in a 2-parent family who is: A minor who has not graduated from HS/GED, see 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 2 0). OR An 18 - or 19 -year old who has not graduated from HS/GED, and has chosen the education option, see 0012.06 (Requirements for Caregivers Under 20) . CHILD UNDER 12 MONTHS, REGARDLESS IF CHILD'S NEEDS ARE INCLUDED IN THE GRANT A 1-parent family (with no other DWP exclusion reason) that includes a child under 12 months is not eligible for DWP, unless the parent previously used all of the 12-month lifetime ES exemption limit. Take a Combined Application - Addendum (DHS - 5223C) (PDF) for the newborn and move the case to MFIP. If the determination is made more than 30 days after the DWP application date, have the participant complete an MFIP Transition Application Form (DHS -5223E) (PDF) as part of the process. Terminate DWP allowing for proper notice. Once the MFIP case is opened, the caregiver is required to choose within 10 days whether to use the child under 12 months exemption or use it at a later date. A 2-parent household that includes a child under 12 months with no other DWP exclusions MUST participate in DWP. In a 2 - parent family only 1 parent in any 1 month is eligible for the ES exemption if the unit has not already used the 12 month lifetime limit.

Counties should also accommodate demonstrated needs for culturally -specific services as resources allow. Reasonable distance means that the total commuting time to the child care provider and to work does not exceed 2 hours round trip. Unsuitability of informal care means that the provider does not meet standards regarding health and safety of the child that would be applied to legal, non- licensed providers. Affordable chil d care arrangements means the provider does not charge in ex cess of the maximum amount the county is allowed to pay, as established in a rate schedule set each year.

For information on type and length of MFIP sanctions depending on case circumstances, 1st or subsequent occurrence of non compliance, and dual sanctions, see 0028.30.03 (Pre 60 Month Type/Length of ES Sancti ons) . DWP: Disqualify any family unit that includes a participant who fails to comply with DWP Employment Services or Child Support Enforcement requirements, without good cause. See 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non -Compliance --MFIP/DWP) . Provide written notice and appeal provisions to the participant prior to disqualifying the family unit. See 0026 (Notices) . The disqualification does not apply to SNAP or health care benefits. A participant who has been disqualified from DWP due to non- compliance with Employment Services may regain eligibility by complying with program requirements. A participant who has been disqualified from DWP due to noncooperation with Child Support may regain eligibility by complying with Child Support requirements. Once a participant has been reinstated, issue prorated benefits for the remaining portion of the month. In a 2-parent family, both parents must be in compliance before the family unit can regain eligibility for benefits. A family unit that has been disqualified from DWP due to non- compliance is not eligible for MFIP or any other TANF cash program during the period of time the participant remains non -compliant for up to the remainder of the 4 -month DWP period. The disqualification for a DWP unit closed due to non- cooperation does not carry over to MFIP. For child care program eligibility policy during a DWP disqualification, see the Child Care Assistance Program Policy Manual . NOTE: DWP does NOT include a minimum length of time a case must be closed due to non- compliance. To regain DWP eligibility after an initial disqualification, a participant must comply with the terms of her or his EP. Since DWP is a short -term program, it is important that participants do not remain disqualified for an extended period of time. The county and ES provider should work to re -engage the disqualified participant in Employment Services as soon as possible. If a participant fails to comply with his or her EP a 2nd time and becomes disqualified again, the county should again review the EP and redetermine what it will take for the participant to regain eligibility. This 2nd determination may differ from the previous determination, which was driven by the desire to have the participant re- engage in DWP Employment Services as quickly as possible. For example, with the 1st disqualification, a county may simply require the participant to start attending job search again to regain eligibility for DWP. However, when the participant is disqualified a 2nd time for failing to attend job search ses sions, the county may decide that the participant must make up all of the missed days or job search workshops before regaining eligibili ty. Compliance expectations should be reasonable and support the program goal of engaging people in work and improving family stability within the 4- month program. Counties should develop guidance for Employment Services providers to ensure that all participants are treated equitably but must not require closure for a set period of time. A participant remains disqualified from DWP until the participant complies with all program requirements. There is no minimum or COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 08/2020 SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY - CASH 0028.30 maximum amount of time the case must be closed. If the participant complies during the 4 consecutive months of DWP eligibility, issue DWP benefits to the family unit. Prorate the benefits from the date of cooperation. Have the family complete a new CA F only if they have been off assistance for more than 30 days. SNAP: For information on SNAP E&T sanctions, see 0028.30.06 (Type/Length of SNAP E&T Sanctions) , 0028.30.09 (Refusing or Terminating Employment) . MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions.

For information on sanctions for refusing or terminating suitable employment, see 0028.18.03 (Suitable/Unsuitable Work) , 0028.30.09 (Refusing or Terminating Employment) . MFIP: This section applies to participants who have not reached their 60- month lifetime limit as specified in 0011.30 (60- Month Lifetime Limit) and to all participants who meet eligibility for Family Stabilization Services, regardless whether the case is pre or post 60- month. For information on participants who have reached their 60- month lifetime limit and qualify for a hardship extension, see 0011.33 (MFIP Hardship Extensions) . For sanction information, see 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) , 0028.30.04 (Post 60- Month Empl. Services Sanctions) . Effective 7-1- 03, sanctions count towards closure of the MFIP case. A participant will have his or her case closed at the 7th occurrence of non- compliance. The count toward closure does NOT start over, even if the participant goes off assistance, comes into compliance, and remains in compliance. Use the STAT/SANC panel to track occurrences of non- compliance. Each month that a participant fails to comply with a requirement is considered a separate occurrence of non- compliance. If both participants in a 2- parent assistance unit are out of compliance at the same time, it is considered 1 occurrence of noncompliance. FOR THE 1ST OCCURRENCE (10%) OF NON- COMPLIANCE: by a participant(s) in an assistance unit, reduce the assistance unit's grant by 10% of the MFIP standard of need for an assistance unit of the same size with the residual grant paid to the participant. The reduction in the grant amount must be in effect for a minimum of 1 month. Remove the reduction in the month following the month that the participant(s) returns to compliance. FOR THE 2ND - 6TH OCCURRENCE (30%) OF NON -COMPLIANCE: Vendor pay the shelter costs up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. At county option, you may vendor pay utilities up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. Vendor payment rules apply beginning with the 2nd occurrence of child support sanctions. Non- compliance with child support also counts toward the 7 occurrences and may lead to a 100% sanction. See 0012.24 (Child Support Sanctions) , 0024.09 (Protective and Vendor Payments) for procedures to use when the information necessary to vendor pay is not on file and the vendor refuses to accept partial payment. The residual amount of the cash grant after vendor payment, if any, and the food portion must be reduced by an amount equal to 30% of the Transitional Standard for the family's size. The reduction in the grant must be in effect for a minimum of 1 month and must be removed the month after the month the participant returns to compliance. In a 2- parent household, remove the grant reduction in the month following the month both participants return to compliance. Continue to vendor pay the shelter (and utilities, if applicable) for 6 months after the month in which the participant(s) return to compliance. NOTE: If the participant comes into compliance between occurrences and the next occurrence results in a change in benefit amount, issue a notice of adverse action. Participants must comply on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction in order to cure the sanction. FOR THE 7TH OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: Close the MFIP case (100% sanction). Closure under pre 60-month sanction policy is NOT permanent. The case must be closed for 1 full month but can be reopened after 1 month if the participant demonstrates compliance for up to 1 month. For MAXIS instructions, see TEMP Manual TE02.05.97 (MFIP Re- Appl After 7th/More Non- Compliance). The Employment Services Provider must attempt a face- to-face meeting prior to case closure. Review the participant's case file to determine if: The continued non -compliance can be explained by providing a needed pre -employment activity. This includes activities such COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2018 PRE 60-MONTH TYPE/LENGTH OF ES SANCTIONS 0028.30.03 as volunteer work, literacy programs and related activities, citizenship and English as a Second Language classes, or chemical dependency treatment, mental health services, parenting education, or other programs designed to help families reach their employment goals and enhance their ability to care for their children. OR The participant qualifies for good cause. If the lack of an identified activity can explain the non- compliance, the provider must work with the participant to provide the activity. Also, the county must restore the participant's grant amount to the full amount retroactive to the 1st day in whic h the participant was found to lack pre- employment activities or to qualify for a good cause exception. If the participant's grant is restored, remove the vendor payment of shelter (and utilities), if applicable. A 2-parent assistance unit gets a total of 6 occurrences before closure. For example: if Mom has 3 occurrences and Dad has 3, the next (7th) occurrence results in case closure. However, if both parents in a 2- parent assistance unit are out of compliance during the same month, it counts as 1 occurrence. Closure for non- compliance does NOT make the participant ineligible for SNAP, if otherwise eligible. Determine eligibility for SNAP at the time of closure. Case closure also does not affect health care eligibility. If a case that has been closed for non- compliance is reopened and has another occurrence of non- compliance, vendor pay the shelter costs up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. At county option, you may vendor pay utilities up to the amount of the cash portion of the grant. Reduce the residual amount of the cash grant after vendor payment, if any, and the food portion by an amount equal to 30% of the Transitional Standard for the family's size. A subsequent occurrence of non- compliance for a case reopened after closure for non- compli ance will result in case closure. FOR DUAL SANCTIONING: Impose sanctions as follows for participants who refuse to comply with child support requirements AND have a concurrent sanction for failure to attend orientation or to develop or to comply with their Employment Plan: If the child support non -compliance and other program non -compliance occur in the SAME month, reduce the Transitional Standard and MFIP food portion by 30% for the 1st month, then vendor pay shelter costs (and utilities, if applicable) for the 2nd month. The participant remains subject to vendor payments and 30% sanction until BOTH issues of non -compliance have been resolved. DWP, MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions.

See the 60-month lifetime limit requirements as specified in 0011.30 (60- Mont h Lifetime Limi t). Participants extended under all other extension categories qualify for Family Stabilization Services (FSS) and should be sanctioned under the pre 60- month sanction policy. The sanction provisions in this section apply only to non- compliance with ES requirements. Count ES sanction occurrences by case for purposes of determining when an MFIP unit is permanently disqualified. For information on child support sanctions, see 0012.24 (Child Support Sanction s).

Participants who are determined to be out of compliance may claim good cause for not complying as outlined in 0028.18 (Good Cause for Non- Compliance --MFIP/DWP) . Post 60 -month sanctions differ from action taken during the 1st 60 months because the non- compliance may result in permanent closure of MFIP. SANCTION SEQUENCE The sanction policy below applies ONLY in the following situations. I f: A 1-parent assistance unit receiving MFIP under the employed/employed limited hours extension criteria is not cooperating with ES requirements. OR A 2-parent assistance unit receiving MFIP when BOTH parents are extended under the employed/employed limited hours extension criteria and at least 1 parent is not cooperating with ES requirements . FOR THE 1ST OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The sanction is a 10% grant reduction of the Transitional Standard. Participants can cure the sanction by complying on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction. FOR THE 2ND OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The sanction is a 30% grant reduction of the Transitional Standard after the vendor payment of rent (and utilities, at county option). In addition, case review provisions (face- to-face meeting with participant) are required. Participants can cure the sanction by complying on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction. FOR THE 3RD OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The sanction is a 30% grant reduction of the Transitional Standard plus vendor payment of rent (and utilities, at county option). In addition, case review provisions (face- to-face meeting with participant) are required. Participants can cure the sanction by complying before the effective date of the sanction unless there are months of compliance between occurrences. See NOTE below. FOR THE 4TH OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The unit is disqualified from MFIP. Participants can cure the sanction by complying 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction. NOTE: If the participant comes into compliance between occurrences and the next occurrence results in a change in benefit COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 01/2015 POST 60 -MONTH EMPL. SERVICES SANCTIONS 0028.30.04 amount, issue a notice of adverse action. Participants must comply on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction in order to cure the sanction. DISQUALIFICATION UNDER EXTENSION SANCTION PROVISIONS Participants who are disqualified (MFIP is closed) under the 4th occurrence of post 60- month sanction policy above may be determined eligible for assistance 1 additional time before being permanently disqualified from MFIP. In order to be reopened, the participant(s) must demonstrate compliance with ES requirements for up to 1 month before the MFIP case can be reopened or meet criteria for another extension category. If the participant(s) demonstrates compliance with ES, the effective date of eligib ility must not be prior to the date of cooperation. When the MFIP case is reopened, the participants must remain in compliance. If the participant is out of compliance, send a Notice of Intent to Sanction (NOITS). If the participant does not respond within 10 days, or does not follow through with st eps necessary to comply as listed on the NOITS, the following sanctions apply: FOR THE 5TH OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The sanction is 10% grant reduction of the Transitional Standard. Participants can cure the sanction by complying on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction. FOR THE 6TH OCCURRENCE OF NON- COMPLIANCE: The sanction is permanent disqualification of the case (close the entire MFIP unit). There is no 30% sanction step. Participants can cure the sanction by complying on or before 10 days prior to the effective date of the sanction. NOTE: Before disqualifying a participant, the county must review the participant's case to determine if the Employment Plan is still appropriate and must make a good faith effort to meet with the participant face- to-face. If the participant does not comply, the county agency must send a notice of adverse action informing the participant that the MFIP case will be permanently closed. During the face- to-face meeting, the county agency must: Determine whether the continued non -compliance can be explained and mitigated by providing a pre -employment activity. Determine whether the participant qualifies for a good cause exception. Inform participants of the Family Violence Waiver criter ia and make a referral if appropriate. Inform participants of the sanction status and explain the consequences of continuing non -compliance.

See 0028.18.03 (Suitable/Unsuitable Work) . When participants extended under the \"employed\" or \"limited work due to illness/disability\" category involuntarily lose employment, allow a 1 -month exemption from meeting hourly employment requirements. See 0011.33.03 (MFIP Employed Extension Category) , 0011.33.03.03 (Limited Work Due to Illness/Disability) . When a job counselor determines that a sanction is appropriate for failure to accept or terminating suitable employment, the job counselor will notify the financial worker using the DWP/MFIP Status Update Form (DHS -3165) (PDF) . When you get the Status Update Form, send the participant a Notice of Adverse Action (NOAA). See 0028.30 (Sanctions for Failure to Comply - Cash) .

This provision applies to the 60 -day period prior to application for SNAP and anytime while receiving a SNAP benefit. Refuses suitable employment. See 0028.18.03 (Suitable/Unsuitable Work) . The sanction period must begin with the 1st month following the expiration of the 10- day adverse notice period, unless a fair hearing is requested. If the person who voluntarily quit or reduced work hours is the Principal Wage Earner (PWE), the entire SNAP case must serve the sanction period. If the person who voluntarily quit or reduced work hours is NOT the Principal Wage Earner (PWE), then only the person is disqualified from receiving SNAP, while the other assistance unit members remain eligible. This sanction period is the same length as SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) sanctions. E&T sanctions and Voluntary Quit/reduce work hours sanctions are added together to determine which occurrence it is. If a participant had 1 E&T sanction in the past and now they have voluntary quit their job without good cause, then the voluntary quit sanction would be the 2nd occurrence. FOR THE 1ST OCCURRENCE: Loss of SNAP for 1 month or until compliance, whichever is longer. FOR THE 2ND OCCURRENCE: Loss of SNAP for 3 months or until compliance, whichever is longer. FOR THE 3RD AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCE: Loss of SNAP for 6 m onths or until compliance, whichever is longer.

Once started, the sanction period runs without interruption unless any of the following happen: The PWE returns to the same job. The PWE accepts equivalent employment. A new member joins the unit as the unit PWE. The PWE becomes exempt from work registration , for a reason other than receiving unemployment compensation. MSA, GA, GRH: No provisions. COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2014 SANCTION NOTICE FOR MINOR CAREGIVER 0028.30.12 MFIP: Send an MFIP Notice of Intent to Sanction (DHS -3175) (PDF) to a minor caregiver who is out of compliance with MFIP Employment Services (MFIP -ES) or education requirements . See 0012.06 (Requirements for Under 20) , 0028.12 (Education Requirements) . MFIP -ES staff usually send the Notice of Intent to Sanction. However, in the case of a minor caregiver whose plan to attend school is developed by a social worker, your agency must decide who will send the Notice and make the determination of compliance or non- compliance. If the caregiver takes no action within the required time frame (at least 10 days from the mailing of the notice), the designated county person will notify you of the lack of action via the DWP/MFIP Status Update Form (DHS -3165) (PDF) . At that time, send a Notice of Adverse Action (NOAA) or apply the appropriate sanction if a NOAA is not required. The Notice of Intent to Sanction does the following: Specifies requirements not complied with. Informs that a sanction will be impo sed unless action is taken within the specified time frame (at least 10 days from the mailing of the notice of intent). Informs that good cause reasons for not comp lying should be reported to the job counselor. Provides information about the option to request a conciliation conference and a fair hearing. States that continuing non -compliance could result in additional sanctions including case closure. A caregiver has at least 10 calendar days from the mailing of the notice to come into compliance or request a conciliation conference. A caregiver may request a fair hearing upon receipt of the Notice of Intent to Sanction without exercising the conciliation option. If no action is taken within the specified time frame (at least 10 days), you will receive a Status Update form. You must then send a MAXIS Notice of Adverse Action when required. When a minor caregiver who is not involved with a job counselor requests a conciliation conference, the social worker who developed the education plan may conduct the conference. See CONCILIATION CONFERENCE in 0002.13 (Glossary: Conciliation...) . If you receive a timely request, the conference must be conducted within 5 days of the request. A supervisor or designee must review the outcome of the conference. If conciliation resolves the non- compliance, withdraw the sanction notice. The Status Update form is used to notify you to impose or postpone a sanction or that the sanction is cured. DWP: Follow MFIP. Notify the caregiver that non- cooperation results in disqualification.

DWP: County agencies have considerable flexibility to design a referral process for DWP Employment Services. Within 1 working day of determination that the applicant is eligible for DWP, but before benefits are issued to or on behalf of the family unit, refer all caregivers to Employment Services. The referral must be in writing and must contain ALL the following informa tion: Notification that applicants are required to develop an Employment Plan as part of the application process or the DWP application will be denied. The Employm ent Services Provider name and phone number. The immediate availability of supportive ser vices, including, but not limited to, child care, transportation, and other work - related aid. The rights, responsibilities, and obligations of participants in th e program, including, but not limited to, the grounds for good cause, the consequences of r efusing or failing to participate fully with program requirements, and the appeal process. SNAP: Minnesota operates a voluntary Employment and Training (E&T) program. SNAP recipients can choose whether or not to seek employment and training services such as free training, supportive services, transportation assistance and other job related necessities. Encourage recipients to make use of employment and training services. The services can help participants meet work requirements in order to earn additional months of SNAP benefits and also improve their employment prospects and wage potential. The goal is to assist recipients in obtaining a livable wage, leading toward self -sufficiency. An automatic referral from MAXIS will refer time -limited adults s ubject to work requirements to SNAP Employment and Training when SNAP eligibility is determined or when the recipient's exemption from the time limit ends. When the SNAP recipient states that he/she wishes to volunteer, add a worker comment to the MA XIS/Workforce One (WF1) referral stating the recipient is volunteering.

However, many families who have children with disabilities living at home incur higher -than- average expenses that are directly related to the disability. The grants provide families with the flexibility to purchase an array of supports and services to meet specific needs. The goal of the Family Support Grant Program is to prevent or delay the out -of-home placement of children with disabilities and to promote family health and social well- being by enabling access to family -centered services and supports.

The parents/guardian will also be informed if their child has NOT been certified for the School Lunch Program. The parent/guardian may complete an application for that child at the school food service office. Eligibility for free or reduced price meals for the child is based on their household income. If for some reason a child's name is not on the electronic match sent to the schools, the child can still enroll in the program by applying directly to the school. When clients apply through the schools, verify MFIP or SNAP benefit status if the client signs a written release of information.

COMBINED MANUAL ISSUE DATE 12/2016 REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM S 0030 UNITED STATES REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM The United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is a federal humanitarian and protection program that provides for the resettlement of people who have been forced to flee their homeland and are unable to return because of a well -founded fear of persecution. Individuals are screened for eligibility for admission to the U.S. while overseas, in a process that involves screening by non- governmental organizations, interviews with U.S. immigration officers, verification of persecution claims, medical clearances, background checks, and extensive security clearances. These processes involve multiple federal agencies, including the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and the National Counterterrorism Center. For more information on refugee admissions in the U.S., see US Department of State, Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration, Refugee Admissions . The goals of the USRAP are: To provide a safe haven to people approved for refugee status who are not able to safely return to their home country or integrate into the country they fled to. To assist them to achieve economic self -sufficiency as q uickly as possible after arrival to the U.S. Persons with refugee status in the United States are eligible to apply for public benefits, are authorized to work upon arriv al and have a path to citizenship. INITIAL RECEPTION AND PLACEMENT SERVICES FOR R EFUGEES The U.S. Department of State's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) oversees supports and services for refugees during the Initial Reception and Placement period (R&P) - the first 30- 90 days after refugee arrival to the U.S. PRM contracts with 9 national resettlement agencies to provide services to refugees arriving to the United States. Which state a p erson arriving with refugee status is placed in is based on several factors , including: If the refugee has family or close conne ctions in a particular state . If the refugee has particular needs that are best matched with specific resources in a local community . The capacity of local resettlement agencies and communities. Once a person or family with refugee status is allocated to a particular state, they are then assigned to a local resettlement agency affiliated with one of the 9 national agencies. Local resettlement agencies provide initial R&P services to individuals and families arriving with refugee status, in coordi nation with local volunteers such as relatives, faith groups, and community members. For information about local resettlement agencies in Minnesota, see 0030.01 (Local Resettlement Agencies) . For more information about the Reception and Placement Program, see US Department of State/ Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration /The Reception and Placement Program .

Although volunteers or family members helping the family are sometimes referred to as \"refugee sponsors,\" they bear no financial obligation for persons arriving with refugee status. These family or friends assisting refugees are called U.S. Ties . POST-RECEPTION AND PLACEMENT SERVICES FOR REFUGEES The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) oversees supports and services for refugees after the Initial Reception and Placement period.

DO NOT establish an underpayment for prospectively budgeted units for any month for which you based the assistance issued on the best information available at the time, you applied correctly policy, and there was no client error. OVERPAYMENTS When you find a payment was incorrect, reconstruct each budget month and corresponding payment month using the policies and procedures that were in effect for the payment month. The overpayment is the difference between the benefit amount the client actually received and the benefit amount the client should have received. Calculate the overpayment using the Computation of RCA Overpayment Worksheet (PDF) . DO NOT establish an overpayment for prospectively budgeted units for any month for which you based the assistance issued on the best information available at the time, you applied correct policy, and there was no client error.
