The sudden emergence of an infectious respiratory pathogen can spread rapidly around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that events starting abroad can swiftly impact us in Canada. The threat of imported diseases has increased owing to several factors, including increased opportunities for disease emergence due to the effects of globalization; international spread through human and wildlife migration and travel; climate change; and health vulnerabilities related to an aging population. In the last decade the world has witnessed emergence of several respiratory pathogens; Avian Influenza A (H7N9), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS- CoV), and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The WHO and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) recommend increased vigilance and surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). This Respiratory Response Plan is intended to provide guidance to public health professionals to prepare for and respond to known and emerging respiratory pathogens including influenza-like-illness (ILI), seasonal influenza, COVID-19 and any other respiratory pathogens with the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics. This applies to emerging respiratory pathogen investigations where animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission are unknown and the risk to Nova Scotians is not clear. The body of this document will provide context for how national, provincial, and local public health infrastructures can collaborate to prepare for and respond to respiratory pathogens. The appendices are included to ensure that public health professionals can easily access technical guidance for their approach and/or response. It will be reviewed and revised annually or as necessary based on evolving epidemiology. It does not replace the Nova Scotia Health System All Hazards Plan.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 22.0 Goals and Objectives The goal of Nova Scotia's Respiratory Response Plan is to minimize severe illness and death from respiratory pathogens in Nova Scotia. To achieve this goal, a set of objectives have been developed to provide tangible and strategic Public Health actions and interventions. These include: Public Health Response To implement public health measures that minimize severe illness, death and societal disruption from respiratory pathogens, with an emphasis on protecting those at higher risk and vulnerable populations. To minimize the burden of illness through publicly funded vaccination programs for vaccine preventable respiratory pathogens. To ensure public health practitioners have the knowledge, skills, and tools needed to adequately respond to known and emerging respiratory pathogens causing severe illness. To communicate with the public and health system using risk communication strategies and tools. To inform and support the health system respiratory response readiness (e.g., preparing for seasonal surges). Surveillance To monitor trends of COVID-19, influenza and influenza like illness (ILI), and other respiratory pathogens in the community to determine activity levels of disease, including re-emergence. To monitor morbidity and mortality related to respiratory pathogens. To identify groups at higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to respiratory pathogens. To detect and characterize known and emerging respiratory pathogens which may present as ILI or SARI, including seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory pathogens with the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics. To monitor vaccine coverage and safety for vaccine preventable respiratory pathogens. To disseminate surveillance data in a timely manner to inform Public Health Action.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 3Evaluation Evaluation of these objectives is an essential step to support the effectiveness of public health interventions. Guiding Principles Nova Scotia's Respiratory Response Plan is grounded in ethical guiding principles that underpin public health decision-making. Ethical consideration is paramount when balancing the risk to the public from a communicable disease while respecting the rights of individuals. Public health decision making is complex, and the following list does not attempt to describe the entirety of public health ethics, but rather defines a subset of key principles that should be considered as a starting point when making decisions about the control a communicable disease. Equity: All people (individuals, groups, and communities) have a fair chance to reach their full health potential and are not disadvantaged by social, economic and environmental conditions. Proportionality: Any public health intervention should be proportionate to the threat faced, and that measures taken should not exceed those necessary to address the actual risk to the population. This includes demonstrating that the intervention should be effective in achieving the desired aim. In making judgements of proportionality, stronger actions require stronger evidence, and in the absence of evidence, interventions should include an evidence-gathering mechanism. Least Restrictive Means: Intrusion into people's lives should be the minimum possible, while the policy aim can still be achieved Reciprocity: Every means possible should be sought to aid the individual in complying with the requests and impositions. In addition, complying with the public health program may impose sacrifices and burdens and, in whatever way possible, these should be compensated by the program or the agency. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 43.0 Roles and Responsibilities Roles and responsibilities may vary depending on local, provincial, or national involvement. While the Nova Scotia Respiratory Response Plan focuses specifically on communicable disease prevention and control related to respiratory pathogens and actions taken by the Department of Health and Wellness (DHW), Public Health Branch and Nova Scotia Health (NSH), Public Health, it is acknowledged that there are additional partners who have important roles and responsibilities in the response to a respiratory event. This includes partners inside the NSH and IWK health sector, non-health sector, private sector, municipalities, other provincial departments, and international organizations. Similarly, members of the public bear responsibility for keeping themselves informed and for adhering to measures that reduce the spread of illness. 3.1 World Health Organization The WHO provides global guidance to PHAC regarding known and emerging respiratory pathogens which may present as ILI or SARI, including seasonal influenza and any respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics in a timely manner. 3.2 Federal Government Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Canada's response to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and respiratory pathogens is led by PHAC in collaboration with provinces and territories. PHAC is involved in the routine detection, monitoring and analysis of national and international trends and spread of infectious disease threats. PHAC is responsible for leading the development of national standards for detection and reporting of such infectious disease threats, including case definitions and protocols for reporting to allow Canada-wide comparison. PHAC is advised by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). National Advisory Committee on Immunization NACI is a national advisory committee of experts in the fields of pediatrics, infectious diseases, immunology, pharmacy, nursing, epidemiology, pharmacoeconomics, social science and public health. NACI provides guidance on the use of vaccines approved for use in Canada to the Government of Canada. The Committee reports to the Vice-President of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch and works with staff from PHAC to provide ongoing and timely medical, scientific and public health advice on vaccines.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 5Health Canada Health Canada (HC) regulates pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other health products in Canada. In collaboration with PHAC, HC has a role managing events such as outbreaks involving First Nation and Inuit communities. 3.3 Department of Health and Wellness (DHW) Public Health Branch In consultation with various key partners, the DHW Public Health Branch develops the policies, standards, and protocols to guide the provincial public health response to known and emerging respiratory pathogens of interest. Working groups and committees such as the Public Health Measures Working Group and the Immunization Executive Committee, provide recommendations to the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH). The Public Health Branch Surveillance team systematically collects, analyzes and reports on data pertaining to known and emerging respiratory pathogens. When a public health emergency exists and a threat to health is imminent, the Public Health Branch briefs and makes recommendations to government based on a health risk assessment and in consultation with other Nova Scotia government departments, PHAC and relevant agencies. Provincial Public Health Laboratory Network (PPHLN) PPHLN provides timely information and advice on specimen collection, shipping and obtaining results for laboratory investigations of known and emerging respiratory pathogens which may present as ILI or SARI, including seasonal influenza and any respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics. Infectious Disease Expert Group (IDEG) IDEG is an independent advisory committee that provides evidence-based advice on the prevention and control of infectious/communicable diseases to DHW Public Health. 3.4 Department of Natural Resources and Renewables The Department of Natural Resources and Renewables (NRR) works with federal and provincial partners including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and other stakeholders in the surveillance, management and response of respiratory pathogens involving wildlife.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 63.5 Nova Scotia Health (NSH) Public Health Provides investigation oversight to relevant situation(s) in order to take reasonable action to protect the public's health from viral respiratory pathogens (among other communicable diseases), including issuing public advisories and bulletins; conducting case and contact management; implementing proportional public health measures to prevent transmission; monitoring condition of a detained person and issuing a certificate for release, when applicable; implementing enhanced surveillance activities and taking such action as the MOH reasonably believes is necessary to prevent, control, or manage a public health emergency. Provincial Biological Depot The Provincial Biological Depot manages the publicly funded vaccine supply, storage, and distribution to zonal public health offices and local providers 4.0 Key Components This document outlines guidance for timely public health response to known and emerging respiratory pathogens with the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics. Key components include: Immunization Risk Assessment Case Definitions and Other Clinical Information Surveillance and Reporting Public Health Management of Respiratory Pathogens Outbreak Management2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 74.1 Immunization Elements of a viral respiratory pathogen immunization program discussed in this section include: Objectives Planning Principles and Assumptions Vaccine Supply Vaccine Safety Vaccine Storage and Handling Coverage Communication Strategy Objectives The objectives of the Nova Scotia's immunization programs for vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases are to: Provide safe and effective vaccine to all Nova Scotians Decrease morbidity and mortality Allocate, distribute, and administer vaccine as rapidly and equitably as possible Monitor the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine program Limit societal disruption As part of a collaborative approach to COVID-19 pandemic response, Nova Scotia is guided by the PHAC Federal-Provincial-Territorial (FPT) COVID-19 immunization goals and objectives and follows NACI guidance. Vaccines are the cornerstone of primary prevention and pandemic preparedness and response. Immunization of susceptible individuals can be effective in preventing transmission of respiratory pathogens and protecting against severe disease and death. Nova Scotia has publicly funded influenza vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination program for individuals aged 6 months and older. Nova Scotia residents 65 years and older living in LTCF including nursing homes, residential care facilities, and patients in hospital beds in Nova Scotia designated as alternate level of care awaiting LTCF placement are offered inactivated high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD).2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 8The influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are strongly recommended for people at high risk of complications and for those who live with or care for them as outlined in the NACI guidelines. For more information, please see: Nova Scotia COVID-19 Vaccine Program Information for Health Care Providers Publicly Funded Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Information for Health Care Providers. Planning Principles and Assumptions DHW Public Health Branch will provide guidance and communication regarding priority populations and eligibility for vaccines. NSH Public Health will manage allocation and distribution of vaccine products to immunization providers. Knowledge of vaccine inventory status at all levels of the Public Health system, at any given time, is required. Accurate real-time knowledge of vaccine supply and inventory through Panorama allows for adjustments to vaccine shipments or clinic schedules as needed. The inventory system tracks vaccine lots to ensure timely identification of specific products that may be required to be held or recalled in the event of a potential vaccine safety issue. Vaccines require specialized storage, handling, and transport. Protocols, including those in the Nova Scotia Immunization Manual and product-specific drug monographs, should be reviewed. Vaccine safety surveillance must be in place to monitor AEFIs. Vaccine Supply The DHW Public Health Branch is responsible for procurement of sufficient influenza vaccine for Nova Scotians. The annual quantity of influenza vaccine ordered is based on usage during the previous year, upcoming influenza season forecasts, population data and immunization program requirements. Influenza vaccines are delivered to the Nova Scotia Provincial Biological Depot and distributed based on population numbers. COVID-19 vaccines are procured at the federal level and Nova Scotia receives a population- based allocation. Decisions on when and how much COVID-19 vaccine should be brought into province are made based on current and anticipated demand including campaigns, new authorizations, current supply, available vaccines and changes in NACI guidance.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 9Vaccine Ordering Influenza vaccine is usually available in mid-late October but availability is dependent upon vaccine production, licensing, and distribution. COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are ordered by providers from the Nova Scotia Biological Depot via a Shopify online ordering portal. This vaccine ordering process facilitates the advancement of inventory management practices, equitable distribution of vaccines, and improved vaccine ordering flexibility, transparency, and accuracy. Refer to the Publicly Funded Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Information for Health Care Provider Guidance for details on influenza vaccine ordering. Vaccine Safety Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) All AEFIs not normally expected (i.e. listed in the product monograph) that are temporally related to administration of the vaccine need to be reported to local public health in accordance with It's the Law: Reporting of Adverse Events Following Immunization as found at https://novascotia.ca/dhw/CDPC/documents/13087_AdverseEventsPoster_En.pdf Providers reporting an AEFI to public health can obtain the AEFI form and the User Guide from the Public Health Agency of Canada. AEFIs following COVID-19 vaccines are publicly reported monthly here . COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance also involves monitoring of specific conditions identified by Canadian and international health authorities and called adverse events of special interest (AESIs). AESIs must also be reporting to public health by providers. For more information on AESIs refer to Nova Scotia COVID-19 Vaccine Program Information for Health Care Professionals . Vaccine Storage and Handling Safe vaccine storage and handling is a shared responsibility from the time the vaccine is manufactured until it is administered. Cold Chain Management In order to retain the potency of vaccines, providers must maintain the cold chain from the time they pick up vaccines, while they are refrigerated and until administration. For most vaccines it is between 2\u00b0-8\u00b0C. For more information please refer to: http://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/immunization-forms2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 10If there is a cold chain breach, do not use the vaccine but keep it in a bag marked Do Not Use and in a monitored functioning fridge. Report the cold chain to public health at publichealthvaccineorders@nshealth.ca or by calling 902-481-5813. For more detail regarding the maintenance of cold chain please refer to the National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines and the Nova Scotia Immunization Manual . Immunization Coverage Immunization is widely recognized as the most effective means to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, COVID-19, and other vaccine preventable diseases. Immunization coverage is an important health indicator to monitor vaccine uptake levels in the population and assess the susceptibility of the population to vaccine-preventable respiratory pathogens. Regular monitoring of immunization coverage contributes to the planning of public health interventions and programs (e.g., identifying populations most at risk and subsequent targeting of public health action), as well as the evaluation of immunization programs (e.g., achievement of coverage targets). DHW data collection tools and more information on immunization coverage reporting can be found in \"Appendix D\". Immunization Entry and Electronic Records Public Health uses the immunization data from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) which is imported into Panorama to understand vaccine coverage; assess and improve the effectiveness of public health program; and to inform vaccine inventory management. In order for Panorama to accept records from an EMR, the EMR must be configured exactly following the EMR Panorama Vaccine List . Questions on EMR and Panorama interface can be emailed to: panorama@novascotia.ca CANImmunize provides a public platform to book COVID-19 vaccines once individuals are eligible. Administration of vaccines are documented, and individuals can obtain a summary of the vaccines they received electronically. In 2022-23, the public will also be able to book influenza vaccines through CANImmunize at pharmacies and pharmacists will be able to electronically document the vaccines administered. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 11Immunization Communication Strategy DHW collaborates with NSH and the IWK to develop an annual influenza awareness campaign to: Encourage Nova Scotians to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones against influenza. Promote that immunization against influenza is safe, free and advised for all Nova Scotians. Communicate that as travel increases and public health measures are eased, there is more potential for the spread of respiratory pathogens such as influenza. This is achieved by: Providing Nova Scotians with consistent, current and reliable information about influenza disease and influenza vaccines. Ensuring healthcare providers, the health system and public health have access to information about the influenza vaccine. The DHW Public Health Branch also develops communication plans and messaging to update the public on new COVID-19 vaccines and immunization program changes. As well, as develops communication plans around vaccines for other emerging respiratory infections as they become available 4.2 Risk Assessment Risk assessment is a systematic process for gathering, analyzing, and evaluating information to assign a level of public health risk. It provides the basis for taking action to manage and reduce the negative consequences of acute public health risks. These assessments provide valuable input across the country by identifying what is known about circulating respiratory pathogens at a point in time, allowing evidence- based predictions on what might occur and major areas of uncertainty. In Nova Scotia, risk assessments occur in several ways to inform the response to respiratory pathogens. Assessment of risk may be based on: virus characteristics anticipated or experienced impact on the health care system and community population immunity age and other populations at risk of severe illness and death2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 12 severity of illness antiviral resistance estimated effectiveness of control measures public health and health care system preparedness population willingness to adhere to public health measures availability and efficacy of antivirals, treatments and vaccines health system capacity A risk management response requires access to timely information, analyzed and presented in a useful manner. Epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data are key components of risk assessments that are produced to inform the response. One of the most critical requirements is an early assessment of the potential impact of a respiratory pathogen on the health system so it can prepare and plan public health interventions proportional to the situation. 4.3 Case Definitions and Other Clinical Information Case definitions are a set of standard criteria for classifying whether an individual has a particular disease and to ensure comparability for national surveillance purposes. They are intended to support public health activities rather than clinical diagnosis. Nova Scotia tends to adapt national case definitions. Case definitions and other clinical information for respiratory pathogens can be found in \"Appendix A: Clinical Information for Seasonal Influenza and ILI\" and \"Appendix B: Clinical Information for Emerging Respiratory Pathogens\". 4.4 Surveillance and Reporting Surveillance Surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data which informs the understanding of population health, disease trends and outbreaks. Nova Scotia's respiratory surveillance system collaborates with an extensive network of public health partners. Ongoing surveillance occurs across the province for laboratory- confirmed influenza, ILI, COVID-19, and other respiratory pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pertussis. Reporting and surveillance for SARI, and emerging respiratory pathogens are discussed further below in Appendix E section \"Lab Procedures for Emerging Respiratory Pathogens and SARI\". 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 13The Nova Scotia respiratory surveillance system contributes to the national respiratory surveillance system which coordinates provincial/territorial data collection and dissemination of respiratory pathogen activity in Canada. Nova Scotia's Respiratory Surveillance Plan is updated annually and can be found on the Department of Health and Wellness Website. Link coming soon. Figure 1 The Overview of Nova Scotia Respiratory Surveillance Systems describes the types of data, data flow (within the province and to the national level) and the outputs (reports) produced as part of the respiratory surveillance system in Nova Scotia. Details for each of the steps in Figure 1 can be found in \"Appendix D\".

The national and provincial laboratories provide valuable expertise with respect to laboratory investigations for respiratory pathogens. \"Appendix E\" provides details regarding provincial laboratory procedures and reporting.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 14Reporting The Health Protection Act (HPA) provides the legal framework enabling public health officials to carry out disease control activities without unduly interfering with civil rights and liberties. The HPA requires specific diseases and conditions be reported according to the timeframes indicated in It's The Law . Procedures for reporting ILI, laboratory confirmed influenza, COVID-19, emerging respiratory pathogens, and SARI can be found in \"Appendix D\". 4.5 Public Health Management of Respiratory Pathogens The DHW Public Health Measures Working Group provides advice to Public Health Branch leadership on public health measures related to respiratory pathogens such as COVID-19. See \"Appendix C\" for details about the public health case and contact management of ILI, seasonal influenza, SARI, COVID-19, and emerging respiratory pathogens. 4.6 Outbreak Management A disease outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of a specific disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of persons during a specific period. Usually, the cases are presumed to have a common cause or to be related to one another in some way. Refer to the following documents for guidance related to outbreak management of respiratory infections, including ILI, seasonal influenza, COVID-19, emerging pathogens, and SARI: Public Health Outbreak Response Plan 2022-2023 A Guide to Respiratory Virus Infections and Outbreak Management in Long-Term Care Facilities Nova Scotia Surveillance Guidelines for Notifiable Diseases and Conditions, Public Health Alerts section Nova Scotia Interim Guidance: Public Health Measures of cases and contacts associated with Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) Guidance Document for Congregate Living Settings In addition to the above documents, refer to \"Appendix D\" for further information regarding outbreak reporting procedures. Consult with the MOH when needed to determine further public health follow up in the event of an outbreak (e.g., community- based control strategies such as closure of schools/gatherings). 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 155.0 Conclusion The Respiratory Response Plan does not cover all aspects of respiratory pathogens that have the potential to affect the public health system. It is a tool for public health professionals to utilize in respiratory pathogen response planning and preparation efforts to ensure a coordinated response to unknown and unexpected threats that may emerge. These efforts are a shared responsibility across the health system in Nova Scotia. The Respiratory Surveillance Plan for Nova Scotia outlines Nova Scotia's surveillance plan for respiratory pathogens in 2022-23 and can be accessed on the Department of Health and Wellness Website. Link coming soon.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 16Appendix A: Clinical Information for Seasonal Influenza and ILI 1. Seasonal Influenza and ILI Case Definitions Confirmed case of Influenza The national case definition can be found here: Laboratory-confirmed influenza (including novel influenza subtypes) - Canada.ca Clinical illness defined as influenza-like-illness (ILI) Surveillance case definition for reporting purposes can be found here: Flu (influenza): FluWatch surveillance - Canada.ca Acute onset* of respiratory illness with fever and cough and with one or more of the following: sore throat arthralgia myalgia prostration which is likely due to influenza In children under 5, gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present. In patients under 5 or 65 and older, fever may not be prominent. *distinct change from normal status to respiratory illness over 1-3 days, based on clinical judgement Causative Agent Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are classified into three distinct types on the basis of major antigenic differences: influenza A, B, and C. Influenza A and B are routinely associated with regional and widespread epidemics whereas influenza C is more commonly responsible for sporadic cases, mild illness and minor localized outbreaks. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 17Influenza A is further categorized into subtypes based on the presence of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Hemagglutinin is required for the initial attachment to cells to start infection. Neuraminidase plays a role in facilitating the virus reaching the cell surface by disrupting mucus and the release of progeny virus from infected cells. Although there are 18 different types of HA and 11 types of NA, only limited subtypes have infected humans. Currently H3N2 and H1N1 strains routinely cocirculate in humans. Influenza A viruses are known to cause more severe illness and have been the only influenza virus to cause pandemics. Influenza B is more stable with less antigenic drift (small antigen changes of influenza viruses) compared to Influenza A. There are two main Influenza B lineages-Yamagata and Victoria. Source Humans are the primary reservoir for human infections. Birds and other mammals such as swine may serve as potential sources of emerging subtypes capable of infecting humans thought to emerge through genetic reassortment or antigenic shift (major antigen change in influenza A virus only, resulting in new HA and/or new HA and NA proteins). Incubation The incubation period for influenza ranges from one to four days. On average, symptoms may appear within two days of exposure to the virus. Transmission Primary transmission occurs directly person to person through large droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person propelled through the air (generally up to two meters) and deposited on the mouth, nose or eyes of people nearby. The virus can also be spread through indirect transmission via contaminated objects or surfaces, e.g., a person touches respiratory droplets on an object (e.g., door knob, clothing, toys, etc.) and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes (or someone else's mouth or nose) before washing their hands. Influenza virus may persist for two to eight hours on solid surfaces, particularly on hard, impermeable surfaces and in lower temperatures and lower humidity. Communicability Adults shed influenza virus one day before symptoms begin through five to ten days after illness onset. Young children also might shed virus several days before illness onset, and children and immunocompromised hosts can be infectious for ten or more days after onset of symptoms.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 18Symptoms The spectrum of clinical features of seasonal influenza ranges from no symptoms to severe complicated illness. Typically, symptoms present as an acute onset of fever, cough (usually dry), and myalgia. Headache, chills, prostration, rhinitis, and sore throat may also be present. Cough is often severe and can last two or more weeks; fever and other symptoms generally resolve in five to seven days. For surveillance purposes, Nova Scotia has adopted the National ILI definition as above. Diagnostic Testing Refer to \"Appendix E\" Treatment and Prophylaxis In Canada, two neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are licensed for use as treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis against influenza. Each year, the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) monitors the susceptibility of circulating strains of influenza to these antivirals and over the past few years the predominant circulating strains have been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but it is important to be aware of the potential for antiviral resistance to occur. The choice of drug depends on resistance patterns of different influenza viruses towards individual antiviral agents; therefore, recommendations may change as new information becomes available. Public Health is available to help guide the choice of antiviral agent. Antivirals should be started as soon as possible, however, are most beneficial when started within 48 hours of developing symptoms. Antiviral treatment should still be considered after 48 hours for those with progressive, severe or complicated illness or if the individual belongs to a group at risk for severe disease. Initiation of antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation. Antiviral treatment is usually continued for a maximum of five days but can occasionally be extended. The use of antivirals for prophylaxis is typically reserved for controlling outbreaks among residents and staff of long-term care facilities and other residential institutions. For further instructions regarding the use of antivirals in outbreak settings, please refer to the 2022- 2023 A Guide to Respiratory Virus Infection and Outbreak Management in Long-Term Care Facilities . For guidelines on the use of antiviral treatment, please refer to the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada website at https://www.ammi.ca/Content/ AC-%20Guidance%20of%20Antiviral%20Agents%2019-20.pdf For information on use of antiviral treatment during influenza and Covid-19 co-infection , please refer to 2021-2022 AMMI Canada guidance on use of antiviral drugs for influenza in the COVID-19 pandemic setting in Canada at https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/ epdf/10.3138/jammi-2022-01-31 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 19Appendix B: Clinical Information for Emerging Respiratory Pathogens Emerging respiratory pathogens refer to respiratory pathogens that have potential to cause serious public health impact, including potential to spread rapidly around the world leading to a pandemic. Emerging pathogens may be caused by the emergence of new variants of known respiratory pathogens or emergence of novel pathogens. Therefore, increased vigilance in the surveillance of SARI and other known emerging respiratory pathogens as listed below, is required to ensure a prompt response according to Nova Scotia's Respiratory Response Plan. 1. Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) 2. Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) 3. Avian Influenza 4. Variant Influenza Viruses of Swine Origin Please note the information in this Appendix B is intended to assist public health professionals to manage a case of an emerging respiratory pathogen. It does not provide specific guidance to clinicians to diagnose an emerging respiratory pathogen, nor does it replace clinical judgement. Refer to It's the Law for a full list of disease and conditions required by the Health Protection Act to be reported to Public Health. Refer to \"Appendix E\" for 'Think Test Tell' information regarding what to do if a clinician suspects a case of an emerging pathogen.

Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Case Definition The national surveillance case definition can be found here: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emerging-respiratory-pathogens/ severe-acute-respiratory-infection-sari-case-definition.html Causative Agent Clinicians should maintain an awareness of known circulating respiratory pathogens, as well as novel respiratory viruses circulating elsewhere in the world and consider virus- specific risk assessments for Canada. Recognition of a cluster or similar cases within a household or community is an important detail. Symptoms Symptoms of SARI may vary depending on etiological agent; however, are primarily defined by acute onset of respiratory symptoms such as: Fever (over 38\u00b0C). Fever may not be prominent in patients under 5 years or 65 years and older as well as in immunosuppressed individuals. Failure to clinically obtain temperature should not rule out a history of self-reported fever. New onset of (or exacerbation of chronic) cough or breathing difficulty. Clinical, radiological or histo-pathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g., pneumonia, pneumonitis, or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]), typically associated with the need for hospitalization, intensive care unit monitoring and/or other severity markers (such as death). It is important to note that a spectrum of illness is recognized for most infectious diseases inclusive of mild or asymptomatic infection. Atypical presentations without any respiratory symptoms can occur with some emerging pathogens particularly when the individual has comorbidities, notably immunosuppression. Therefore, both clinicians and public health need to apply judgment when assessing patients with milder or atypical presentations, where, based on contact, comorbidity or cluster history, the index of suspicion may be raised. In addition to the symptoms of ILI, severe ILI may include complications such as encephalitis, myocarditis or other severe and life-threatening complications. Diagnostic testing Refer to \"Appendix E\"2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 21Treatment Clinical management of cases should be guided by the symptoms presented by the patient, including early treatment with appropriate antiviral medication where recommended. 2. Coronaviruses Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. 2.1 COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Case Definition The national surveillance case definition can be found here: https://www.canada.ca/ en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health- professionals/national-case-definition.html Causative Agent SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the Coronaviridae family, is the virus that causes COVID-19. Mutations occur regularly and variant strains continue to be identified. Source SARS-COV-2 is believed to have zoonotic origins as genomic analyses have indicated the virus is related SARS-like viruses found in bats. There has also been research looking at pangolins as the potential natural source; however, no animal reservoir has been confirmed. The earliest recognized cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China were in humans with links to a seafood market where live animals and animal products were sold. To date there is no definitive conclusion about the role the market played in the origin of the outbreak. Incubation The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with a median of 5 to 6 days between exposure and symptom onset. It is important to note that Omicron, currently the most commonly detected variant, has a shorter estimated mean incubation period of approximately 3 to 4 days.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 22Transmission SARS-COV-2 is spread through the respiratory droplets and aerosols of an infected person when breathing, sneezing, coughing, speaking, etc. The infected droplets and/ or aerosols may be transmitted directly to another person by landing on the mucous membranes (e.g., mouth, nose, eyes) or indirectly through inhalation. The virus may also be spread indirectly via contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites) though evidence suggests this is uncommon. Research and outbreak investigations have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is likely amplified in settings where there is poor ventilation, crowded indoor spaces, presence of early symptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases symptomatizes, during aerosol generating procedures, or where physically exertive activities occur (e.g., singing, exercising). Communicability Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are considered most infectious around the time of symptom onset (just before, soon after), as well as during the 48 to 72 hours prior to symptom onset. The exact period of communicability has not been determined, though past modelling studies have suggested approximately 8 to 10 days post symptom-onset and more recently an estimated 3 to 6 days post symptom-onset for the Omicron variant. Symptoms There is a great variability in symptoms of COVID-19 depending on the circulating variant, age of the person infected, among other factors. Symptoms range from asymptomatic infection to mild illness to severe disease and death. Most reported symptoms include sore throat, rhinorrhea, new or worsening cough, difficulty breathing, fever (38 degrees), chills, myalgia, fatigue, headache, anosmia, ageusia, diarrhea, and vomiting. A novel pathological feature of the SARS-COV-2 virus includes long-term sequelae, now referred to as post COVID-19 condition (or long COVID). Post COVID-19 condition is when individuals continue to experience physical or psychological symptoms 12 weeks after recovering from COVID-19. Individuals who have required hospitalization during recovery have been found at greater risk of experiencing longer-term effects. More information about post COVID condition can be found here: Post-COVID-19 condition (long COVID) - Canada.ca Diagnostic Testing Refer to \"Appendix E\"2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 23Treatment Most individuals with non-severe COVID-19 do not require treatment beyond supportive measures. COVID-19 vaccination provides protection against severe illness and hospitalization. For individuals with early, symptomatic, non-severe COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), remdesivir, and/or sotrovimab may be considered. Therapy selection depends on individual factors such as symptom duration, age, weight, pregnancy, renal/hepatic functions, drug interactions, etc. Individuals who do not meet all criteria for treatment may still be considered at a case- by-case basis. For more detailed information, refer to Nova Scotia Health COVID-19 Pharmacist Consult Services . Nova Scotia Health uses a Report and Support screening form to identify Nova Scotians at risk. It is a time sensitive information collection tool for individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. It is used to quickly identify people who are eligible for and may benefit from COVID-19 treatments to reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization.

Analysis suggests the virus originated in bats of and was transmitted to camels at some point. Recent studies point to the role of camels as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection in humans through direct or indirect contact with infected camels or camel-related products (e.g., raw camel milk). Incubation The incubation period for MERS-CoV is still largely unknown but has been estimated to be 2-14 day (median approximately 5 days). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) also demonstrated a prolonged incubation period (median 4-5 days; range 2-10 days) compared to other human coronavirus infections (average 2 days; typical range 12 hours to 5 days). To allow for inherent variability, recall error and to establish consistency with other emerging respiratory virus monitoring, exposure history based on the prior 14 days is a reasonable and safe approximation. Transmission The current pattern of disease suggests that the virus can spread between humans. Clusters have been reported among close contacts and in health care settings; however, there has been no sustained person-to-person transmission and the risk of contracting this infection is still considered to be low. Outbreaks of MERS-CoV have mainly resulted from nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities. Outside the health care setting, there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission documented anywhere in the world. Communicability The period of communicability for MERS-CoV is unknown at this time. Symptoms MERS-CoV infections are wide ranging from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV involves fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is also common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, and diarrhea have also been reported Those who are immunocompromised, have chronic health conditions, or are older are believed to be at higher risk of severe disease. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 25Diagnostic testing Clinician and public health judgment should be used in assessing patients with milder or atypical presentations, where, based on contact, comorbidity or cluster history, the index of suspicion may be raised. Additional information can be found in the Interim Guidance For Containment When Imported Cases With Limited Human-To-Human Transmission Are Suspected/Confirmed In Canada . Clinician discretion, epidemiologic context and local feasibility should be considered in discussions with local/provincial health authorities. Refer to \"Appendix E\" for further information on diagnosis of emerging respiratory pathogens. Treatment At this time, there is no vaccine or specific treatment targeting the virus so treatments should be based on symptom management. 2.3 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Case Definition The national case definition can be found here: https://www.canada.ca/en/public- health/services/reports-publications/canada-communicable-disease-report-ccdr/ monthly-issue/2009-35/definitions-communicable-diseases-national-surveillance/ severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars.html Causative Agent A previously unknown type of coronavirus. Source The first Canadian cases were identified in March 2003, during a global outbreak involving 4 countries. Cases were in people who had traveled to Hong Kong and returned to Canada. Subsequent cases in Canada were traced to the first cases through close contacts, including health care workers, or to other travelers who had been in areas of Asia affected by SARS. There is still a great deal about SARS that remains unknown Incubation Incubation period of SARS has typically been 2 to 7 days but may last up to 10 days in some people. To allow for inherent variability, recall error and to establish consistency with other emerging respiratory virus monitoring, exposure history based on the prior 14 days is a reasonable and safe approximation2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 26Transmission SARS is understood to be a readily transmissible virus which spreads through small respiratory droplets produced from a cough or sneeze of an infected individual. These droplets are propelled through the air and may be spread directly to others nearby by entering the mouth, nose, or eyes. The virus is also spread indirectly by others touching surfaces contaminated with droplets and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. It is unknown at this time whether the SARs virus is spread more broadly via airborne transmission. Communicability The period of communicability for SARS is unknown at this time. It is recommended that outbreak containment measures involve quarantine of suspect contacts for 10 days. Symptoms Initial onset is typically marked by high fever (>38 degrees C), chills, headache, malaise, and muscle pain. Symptoms may progress to cough (dry, non-productive), dyspnea, and at times hypoxemia around 2-7 days following onset. 10-20% of cases may suffer from more severe symptoms requiring mechanical ventilation. Case fatality has been reported around 9%, but over 50% in those 65 years and older. Diagnostic Testing Symptoms of SARS are similar to those of other respiratory infections. SARs cannot be diagnosed on symptoms alone. Refer to \"Appendix E\" for further information on diagnosis of emerging respiratory infections. Treatment There is currently no vaccine or treatment for SARS. Clinical management is based on individual symptomology. 3. Avian Influenza Avian influenza is an emerging infectious zoonotic pathogen caused by influenza A viruses that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds around the globe, including waterfowl (e.g., geese, ducks) and shorebirds (e.g., plovers, sandpipers). Avian Influenza is easily transmitted among wild and domestic birds including poultry (e.g, turkey). Avian influenza viruses are categorized into two types based on pathogenicity in birds (not predictive of severity in humans): Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI): cause mild to no signs of disease; however, in poultry LPAI can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 27Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI): can cause severe disease and high mortality in avian species including domestic poultry. In Nova Scotia, Avian Influenza in wildlife (birds and other animals) are investigated by the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables (NRR) , and cases in domestic poultry are investigated by the Department of Agriculture and/or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). NSH Public Health will be notified when wild animals test \"non- negative\" for Avian Influenza by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative. These animal specimens will then be sent for testing by the CFIA (typically 2-3 weeks for confirmatory results). For each of these cases, NSH Public Health conducts a risk assessment and investigates any associated human exposures. NRR staff will follow departmental procedures involving human exposures and Public Health is available to provide support and guidance as needed. Public Health does not follow cases of Avian Influenza in birds, poultry, or other animals. Risk to Human Health Currently, avian influenza viruses pose little risk to human health; however, sporadic human infections do occur and there is concern around potential for avian influenza viruses to mutate into a highly transmissible human infection. Human to human transmission is rare and most often limited to close contacts; no sustained or community level transmission has been identified to date. Two avian influenza strains are of recent interest due to potential impact on human health: 1) H5N1 and 2) H7N9 . Avian influenza A H5N1 has been spreading across Canada since December 2021 infecting resident and migratory aquatic birds, commercial poultry, and mammals, including foxes, skunks, and mink. Nova Scotia was the first province to detect HPAI H5N1 in commercial domestic poultry on February 3, 2022. In June 2022, the Public Health Agency of Canada assessed the current risk of H5N1 to human health stating the risk of infection to the general population is low, however the population with close contact to infected animals is at increased risk due to the higher probability of exposure. Ultimately, the current associated pandemic risk constitutes a low probability, yet high impact event. Since December 2021, two human infections with avian influenza A H5N1 have been identified outside of Canada, and no human cases have been identified in Nova Scotia. There have been no human infections of H7N9 in Canada since 2015. Upon notification of an avian influenza outbreak with human health implications, i.e. humans have been exposed, NSH Public Health should initiate an investigation and implement appropriate public health measures in accordance with NSH Standard Operating Procedures. These measures will include primary prevention (e.g., infection control measures and antiviral prophylaxis), and case management activities. Investigations would also include identification, understanding and containing sources of human infection. Public health measures taken will largely depend on the initial findings from the epidemiologic assessment of the outbreak. NSH Public Health should refer to internal standard operating 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 28procedures and the Nova Scotia Health Avian Exposure Checklist for further guidance on high, moderate and low risk exposure investigations. For more information and updates on human health issues related to avian influenza refer to: Public Health Agency of Canada Case and Contact Management Guidance: https://www. canada.ca/en/public-health/services/reports-publications/human-health-issues- related-avian-influenza.html Nova Scotia Government: https://novascotia.ca/avian-influenza/ 3.1 Avian Influenza A H5N1 Case Definition A national case definition for H5N1 is under development. Causative Agent Epizootic subtype of avian influenza A virus Source Sick or dead wild birds or poultry are the main source of human infections. Incubation Incubation period of H5N1 in humans is currently understood to be on average of 2 to 5 days but ranging up to 17 days. This is a much more prolonged incubation period than seasonal influenza viruses (i.e. 1 to 3 days). To allow for inherent variability, recall error and to establish consistency with other emerging respiratory virus monitoring, exposure history based on the prior 14 days is a reasonable and safe approximation Transmission Avian influenza is transmitted through bird saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Human cases of Avian influenza are caused by close contact with infected live or dead birds or contaminated objects or environments. People are most likely exposed to the virus during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparing for cooking. The virus may also be carried on soiled objects such as boots, vehicle tires, or other gear, and can survive in water. Communicability Human to human transmission has been limited and non-sustained though has occurred in with close and prolonged contact, usually between family members. Limited data suggests individuals may remain infectious for as long as 3 weeks and in immunocompromised individuals may be longer.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 29Symptoms It can take from 2 to 8 days or longer for symptoms to appear after exposure, but those infected can develop severe illness quickly. Common initial symptoms include high fever, cough, aching muscles, sore throat and may also include stomach pain, chest pain or diarrhea. Infection can progress rapidly to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty breathing, pneumonia) or neurological changes such as change from baseline mental state or seizures. Diagnostic testing Refer to \"Appendix E\" for further information on diagnosis of emerging respiratory infections. Treatment Early treatment with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir may reduce duration and severity of illness if started within 48hrs of symptom onset. The optimal dose and duration of therapy are uncertain. Please consult an Infectious Disease specialist for current treatment details. 3.2 Avian Influenza A H7N9 Case Definition The national case definition for H7N9 subtype of avian influenza A virus Source Migrant aquatic birds are most likely the original infection source. Majority of human infections are associated with exposure to live poultry. Incubation Incubation period for H7N9 has been reported as ranging from 1 to 10 days (average 5 days). To allow for inherent variability, recall error and to establish consistency with other emerging respiratory virus monitoring, exposure history based on the prior 14 days is a reasonable and safe approximation2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 30Transmission The available data strongly indicates that most known human H7N9 infections result from direct contact with infected poultry or indirect contact through contaminated environments where live poultry are sold. The virus does not appear to transmit easily between humans and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported based on information gathered from outbreaks in China. H7N9 infections do not cause severe disease in poultry and therefore, infection can spread \"silently\" among poultry. Under such circumstances, the exact exposure for individual cases of human infection may be difficult to establish. Communicability Limited human-to-human transmission reported, whereby transmission probably occurred during close unprotected contact with a severely ill patient. Symptoms Initial presentation of illness may include mild symptoms such as fever, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite and rhinitis. However, symptoms are known to progress into a severe respiratory illness. Pneumonia is a common complication leading to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Death may also occur in severe cases. Clinician and public health judgment should be used in assessing patients, where, based on contact, comorbidity or cluster history, the index of suspicion may be raised. Additional information can be found in the Interim Guidance for Public Health Management of Human Illness Associated with Avian Influenza A (H7N9) . Assessment of symptoms should focus on the detection of SARI as defined above. Diagnostic Testing Refer to \"Appendix E\" for further information on diagnosis of emerging respiratory infections. Treatment Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir or zanamivir can reduce the duration of illness and improve the prospect of survival if administered within 48 hours of illness onset. For information regarding antiviral use in the context of Avian Influenza A (H7N9) virus infection (cases and contacts), please consult AMMI Canada: https://www.ammi.ca/ Content/Guidelines/revised_h7n9_antiviral_guidance_july_16_2013_final.pdf 3.3 Other Avian Influenza For further information regarding other Influenza A virus subtypes H5, H7 and H9, please see laboratory-biosafety-biosecurity/pathogen-safety-data-sheets-risk-assessment/ influenza-a-virus-subtypes-h5-h7-h9.html2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 314. Variant Influenza Viruses of Swine Influenza A viruses that circulate in swine (pigs) and have infected humans are referred to as variant viruses and denoted with a letter \"v\". H1N1v, H1N2v, and H3N2v are influenza A variant viruses that have been found in humans; however, cases in humans are rare and recent evidence indicates no sustained human to human spread has occurred. 4.1 Influenza A H3N2v Symptoms Clinical characteristics of human influenza A H3N2v are similar to symptoms of uncomplicated seasonal influenza, including chills, cough, and headache followed by fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis, myalgia, fatigue and headache. Vomiting and diarrhea may also occur, particularly among infections in children. The duration of illness also appears to be similar to uncomplicated seasonal influenza; approximately 3 to 5 days and up to 10 days. Incubation An incubation period of two to three days has been reported but estimated up to seven days. Source Swine influenza viruses are endemic in pigs. Transmission Most human infections have occurred following close proximity to infected pigs or their environment. However, some human-to-human transmission has occurred, such as during the outbreak of influenza A (H3N2v) in the USA in 2012. It is believed that H3N2v and other influenza A variants of swine origin are transmitted through direct and indirect contact with infected respiratory droplets, similar to seasonal influenza. Communicability Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has been detected in the past but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified. Diagnostic Testing Refer to \"Appendix E\" for further information on diagnosis of emerging respiratory infections Treatment The same antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu may be used to treat human influenza A with swine origin. Consult an Infectious Disease specialist for current treatment details.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 32Appendix C: Public Health Management of Respiratory Pathogens This section contains the following information: 1.

Case Management 1.1 Investigation Laboratory confirmation should guide the extent of an investigation (see \"Figure 2\"); however, because collection, shipment, and testing of specimens often require several days or longer, an investigation may need to begin before laboratory test results are available. If laboratory confirmation is not possible, an investigation should still be launched in certain circumstances especially if a patient is suspected to have SARI or an emerging pathogen infection, such as MERS-CoV. In this case, the patient and/ or guardian or next of kin should be interviewed within the first 24 to 48 hours of the investigation to collect basic demographic, clinical, and epidemiological information. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 33Essential basic information may include: Outbreak or cluster related Sex Age Date of onset Symptoms Whether hospitalized/Date of hospitalization Whether in ICU/Date of ICU admission If deceased/Date of death Lab-date of sample collection, test method and result (when available) Travel history Vaccine history Other possible exposures or risk factors (e.g., ill contact, animal, food)2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 34Figure 2: Influenza, COVID-19, Emerging Respiratory Pathogens and SARI Indications for Case Management Report via Panorama *Follow up may occur in community on case-by-case basis Follow-up with influenza case onlyNotify DHW via phone and email/fax SARI case report to DHW with as much detail as possible.

Ensure consultation with an infectious disease physician and/or medical microbiologist regarding the laboratory protocol. Case investigations for emerging respiratory pathogen and SARI cases should include identification of close contacts (defined below). Active daily monitoring of emerging respiratory pathogen and SARI cases' individual health status for the duration of illness, or until a probable case no longer meets the case definition (e.g., due to further testing results or symptoms are resolved) is mandatory . Clinical management of emerging respiratory pathogen or SARI cases should be guided by the illness in the patient including early treatment with appropriate antiviral medication where recommended. 1.2 Education Provide information regarding: Managing symptoms at home When and where to seek medical advice or assessment. Ensure case or caregiver is aware to report relevant travel history or contact history immediately upon presenting to a health care setting Infection prevention and control measures to limit further transmission of respiratory pathogen 1.3 Case Exclusion In general, people with respiratory symptoms should be advised to stay away from work, school, daycares, and other vulnerable populations (e.g., those who are immunocompromised, pregnant persons, persons 65 years or older, etc) until they are feeling well and are able to fully participate in their usual day-to-day activities. For those who live or work in high-risk settings, such as health care settings, long term care facilities or congregate living settings, should consult their occupational health guidelines and manager to determine if exclusion is necessary and length of exclusion. For additional information around exclusion requirements please refer to: 2022-2023 A Guide to Respiratory Virus Infection and Outbreak Management in Long-Term Care Facilities Guidance Document for Congregate Living Settings For situations that are not clear, consult with the MOH to determine on a case-by-case basis, what further public health follow-up may be required. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 362. Contact Management 2.1 Contact of Laboratory Confirmed Known Respiratory Pathogen In situations involving a laboratory confirmed respiratory pathogen, such as influenza or COVID-19, the identification and follow-up of contacts is relevant only in the context of an outbreak in a LTCF. Please refer to the annual 2022-2023 A Guide to Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infection and Outbreak Management for Long-Term Care Facilities 2.2 Contact of Laboratory Confirmed and Probable Emerging Respiratory Pathogens or SARI Contact management of confirmed and probable cases of emerging respiratory pathogens assists public health: to better understand the epidemiology of these viruses during the period where questions remain about issues such as person-to-person transmission and the reservoir for infection with the rapid identification of symptomatic contacts to reduce the opportunity of transmission to others to review what is known about emerging respiratory pathogens and their associated illness with contacts Contact management depends on current/known epidemiology and the objective (i.e. stop versus limit spread), as such it is important to review plan of action with the MOH. In general, contact management of cases of SARI and emerging respiratory pathogens involves active monitoring by public health staff; ensuring that these individuals are contacted daily for the duration of the self-monitoring period or until they no longer meet a case definition (e.g., due to further testing results). Close Contact: typically, a person exposed to a case during the infectious period within 2 meters, for at least 15 minutes with insufficient PPE, or as otherwise determined in consultation with Public Health Close contacts of confirmed and probable emerging respiratory pathogens or SARI should be advised that for 14 days following the exposure or until no longer meets the case definition as above (e.g.,the laboratory investigation has ruled out MERS-CoV infection/H7N9) to: Self-monitor for fever and new onset of symptoms of influenza-like-illness. Consider staying in an area where health care is readily accessible, if possible Maintain good respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene practices Wear a well-fitting medical mask around others2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 37 If sharing living arrangements with a non-hospitalized case avoid close contact as much as possible and follow relevant advice provided under case management section Should symptoms develop, self-isolate as quickly as possible and contact local public health for further direction Additional contact management measures (e.g., quarantine, aircraft related travel contact tracing procedures etc.) may be required as requested by the MOH. 3. Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Health Care Settings It is an expectation across all health care settings that infection prevention and control (IPAC) measures are adhered to at all times. Consistent application of routine practices for the care of all patients and use of additional precautions when needed remain the cornerstones of prevention of the spread of respiratory pathogens. Routine practices that are to be considered and used at all times include point of care risk assessments (PCRA), frequent hand hygiene, appropriate use of PPE, source control (e.g., respiratory hygiene, two-metre spatial separation), environmental cleaning and disinfection, among other pertinent practices found in detail at the link below. Additional precautions are required when managing cases with a suspected or confirmed respiratory pathogen. These include contact, droplet, and airborne precautions. Dependent on the respiratory pathogen, clinical presentation, or medical procedures (e.g., aerosol generating medical procedures [AGMPs]) a combination of additional precautions may be required. It is important to note, that as new information is gathered on SARI or novel emerging pathogens modifications to recommended additional precautions may be required and will be communicated to healthcare providers. For example, recommendations for the management of MERS-CoV and Avian Influenza H7N9 include the use of airborne precautions (including the use of a respirator) when performing AGMP on cases. Refer to the Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for Preventing the Transmission of Infection in Healthcare Settings and Routine Practice and Additional Precautions Assessment and Education Tools by the PHAC for more detailed information on routine practices and additional precautions.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 38Further information and IPAC resources for health care settings can be found here: Nova Scotia Health Infection Prevention and Control Policy: http://policy. nshealth.ca/Site_Published/NSHA/document_render.aspx?documentRender.

Additional precautions applied may be specific to the setting and local epidemiology. Care of an individual with a respiratory pathogen should be performed in a location with spatial separation from others in the home, preferably in a well-ventilated (e.g., open window) room of their own. If a separate room is not feasible, a two-metre distance should be established in a shared room whenever possible. AGMPs should not be carried out in the home setting.

The ED surveillance system was implemented in April 2009 with the support of infection control practitioners across Nova Scotia. Infection control practitioners report ILI data to DHW from the EDs for which they are responsible. DHW coordinates and maintains the ED surveillance network (see \"Figure 3\").2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 41Figure 3: Emergency reporting of ILI *Data includes: Total number of patients seen/day Total number of patients meeting the ILI case de nition/dayInfection control practitioners in emergency departments submit ILI data weekly (Mon. mornings) in accordance with infl uenza surveillance weeks (Sun. to Sat.) to DHW.*ILI data analyzed weeklyDHW disseminates ILI statistics via Respiratory Watch 1.2 Schools and Daycares School and daycare-based surveillance for ILI is ongoing in Nova Scotia (see \"Figure 4\"). Schools are requested to report absenteeism that may be due to ILI, directly to their local public health office. With the emergence of COVID-19, absenteeism may be monitored using an automated system such as Power School or where required calling the schools as a form of Active Surveillance. 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 42Figure 4: School and Daycare Reporting Procedures Determine the number and percentage of students and staff absent and the predominant symptoms* No further actionPublic Health receives call from daycare/school reporting increased absenteeism Encourage school/daycare to ask for the reason for absenteeism when parents call to report as absence due to illness Initiate daily active surveillance until absenteeism levels return to <10% or lower than Baseline, as determined by school/daycareYes No No further actionNo Yes>10% absenteeism or higher level of symptoms of ILI than expected in staff or students, as determined by school or public health authority experiencing>10% absenteeism or higher than baseline levels of ILI symptoms, in staff or children likely due to ILI as determined by the daycare DHW reports weekly aggregate influenza hospitalizations/ deaths and COVID-19 case line list to PHAC Report outbreaks through normal Flu Watch proceduresSchool Daycare2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 43It is important to distinguish between respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, noting that schools commonly refer to vomiting and diarrhea illness as the 'flu'. The School Surveillance Tool or the Daycare Surveillance Tool should be used to ensure complete information. 1.3. Long Term Care Facility (LTCF) and Acute Care Facility LTCF and acute care facilities are required to immediately report confirmed outbreaks of ILI and other respiratory pathogens (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)). Local public health will report confirmed outbreaks and notify the public health system as appropriate, via the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI). LTCF and acute care facilities may reach out to local public health in the event of a suspect outbreak of an unidentified pathogen. Please refer to the 2022-2023 A Guide to Respiratory Virus Infection and Outbreak Management for Long-Term Care Facilities for more detailed information. 2. Reporting Laboratory Confirmed Influenza and COVID-19 The flow of information related to laboratory-confirmed influenza and COVID-19 is described in \"Figure 5\". For Nova Scotia DHW Surveillance Guidelines for 2019-Novel- Coronavirus-Surveillance-Guidelines.pdf (novascotia.ca) Please refer to \"Figure 2\" for information pertaining to case management and entry into Panorama (the Public Health Electronic Information System).

Reporting Hospitalizations and Deaths Case follow-up is required for all hospitalized cases and deaths of influenza, regardless of type. Hospitalized cases and deaths of influenza must be reported to DHW via Panorama. Hospitalized cases must be followed by NSH Public Health until discharge or death (maximum follow-up of 4 weeks). Data for hospitalized cases and deaths of COVID-19 are provided weekly to NSH Public Health by DHW Surveillance. The outcome for these cases is updated in Panorama. Deaths may also be reported from Nova Scotia Vital Statistics to DHW. Under the HPA, the registrar of Vital Statistics must forward any death certificate which lists a notifiable disease or condition. The death registration will be forwarded to local public health for appropriate follow-up. 4. Reporting Emerging Respiratory Pathogens and SARI To ensure rapid alerting of senior Public Health officials and consistent and immediate public messaging, the following steps (\"Figure 6\") need to be taken in a suspect case of SARI and an emerging or novel respiratory infection/pathogen identified in Nova Scotia. Please refer to \"Figure 2\" for information pertaining to case management, including case report form completion2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 45Figure 6: Procedure for reporting a suspect case of SARI and an emerging or novel respiratory infection/pathogen in Nova Scotia.

Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) 5.1 Public Health Alerts Public Health Alerts (PHA) are an application on CNPHI that allows for the timely notification and/or dissemination of information between local/regional, provincial, territorial, and national public health stakeholders. PHAs will not be used routinely to report school and daycare absenteeism or outbreaks in LTCF and acute care facilities (this is done in Outbreak Summaries). However, Public Health may consider the use of a PHA to notify other jurisdictions of certain outbreaks or unusual events (note that the definition of unusual is subjective and may require a certain level of public health professional discretion). For probable/confirmed cases of SARI and emerging respiratory pathogen cases, a PHA is required to alert the nation. For details on PHAs see: https://novascotia.ca/dhw/populationhealth/documents/ Public-health-alerts-quick-reference-for-postings.pdf 5.2 FluWatch For details on FluWatch reporting, see the following link: http://novascotia.ca/dhw/populationhealth/public-health-notifications.asp 5.3 Outbreak Summaries Outbreak Summaries is used to report outbreaks in LTCF and acute care facilities. Outbreaks must be reported in Outbreaks Summaries by local public health as soon as notification is received. 6. Influenza and COVID-19 Immunization Coverage Data on immunization coverage is captured in the following ways: Provincial Medical Services Insurance (MSI) primary care provider-billing database CANImms Clinic Flow (provides data on individuals who received influenza and COVID-19 immunizations from pharmacists) CANImms Clinic Flow (provides data on residents who received influenza and COVID-19 immunizations in long term care facilities) Providers must return all unused vaccine at the end of the season to the Biodepot in their zone. Some providers such as Department of National Defence, Victorian Order of Nurses and others submit influenza coverage on paper-based data sheets 2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 47Some providers may be required to complete aggregate data collection forms provided by and returned to NSH Public Health. NSH provides data collection tools to capture the number of influenza vaccines received in various settings. Public Health influenza clinic immunizations are entered into Panorama. Data is collected from influenza vaccine clinics (held by Public Health or other community agencies), LTCF and acute care facilities and can be broken down by the following target groups: Pregnant individuals Children 6 to 59 months Adults 65 years of age and older living in the community Indigenous peoples living on reserve Health care workers in acute care facilities Residents and staff of long-term care facilities Public health at the zone level receives the data from individual facilities and clinics and produces a zone summary that is submitted to NSH.

Laboratory Diagnosis/Overall Testing Rationale The province is preparing for the potential re-emergence of other significant respiratory viral pathogens like influenza and RSV. Respiratory pathogen testing including influenza testing will be available for the acute care setting (including inpatients and emergency department patients) and long-term care facilities. Routine influenza and RSV testing from the community will not be performed unless special circumstances exist and on the approval of a Microbiologist. Please refer to \"Figure 7\".2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 49Figure 7: Nova Scotia Respiratory Testing Algorithm 2022-2023 Viral respiratory testing performed by Nova Scotia Health Laboratories or IWK Health Laboratory Legend * Testing requires consultation/approval by a Microbiologist or advanced notice - public health. ** Multiplex performed at the discretion of a Microbiologist/MOH \u2014 consultation required.

See sections below for specific laboratory requirements. Influenza A/B and RSV testing can be requested on limited basis: Outbreaks (as directed by Public Health or IPAC) Long term care facilities (limited to the first 3 swabs submitted from symptomatic individuals) Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are preferred sample type. Broader multiplex testing for other seasonal respiratory viruses (e.g., rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, etc) will only be performed in specimens submitted from the ICU or immunocompromised individuals. Otherwise, consultation with a microbiologist or medical officer of health is required. A single nasopharyngeal swab can be used to test for influenza and/or COVID-19. Ensure the ordering provider and outbreak number is on the requisition \u2014 if there is no outbreak number put possible ILI outbreak on the requisition. Appropriate specimen types: Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and aspirate Throat and nares Gargle \u2014 for SARS CoV2 only. Not approved for influenza or other respiratory pathogens aspirate Bronchial wash/Lavage Tissue2022-2023 COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS OF NASOPHARYNGEAL SWAB S FOR RESPIRATORY VIR USES Date: 2022-03-08 HOW TO COLLECT THE SAMPLE Follow the 4Ds to obtain a quality swab The 4Ds of NPS collection or view online Nasopharyngeal swabbing for respiratory viruses - the 4 D's (vimeo.com) 1. Use the flexi ble swab supplied with the viral transport media (Sam ple Collection kit poster) . 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 3. When collecting the specimens, wear eye protection, gloves, gown and a mask. Change gloves and wash your hands between each patient. 4. If the patient has a lot of mucus in the nose, this can interfere with the collection of cells. Either ask the patient to us e a tiss ue to gently clean out visible n asal mucus or clean the nostril yourself with a c otton swab (e.g. Q -Tip). 5. How to estimate the distance to the nasopharynx: prior to insertion, measure the distance from the corner of the nose to the front of the ear and insert the shaft approximately 2/3 of this length (Depth ). 6. Seat the patient comfortab ly. Tilt th e patient's head back slightly to straighten the passage from the front of the nose to the nasopharynx to make insertion of the swab easier. 7. Insert the swab provided along the medial part of the septum, along the floor of the nose, until it reac hes the po sterior nares; gentle rotation of the swab may be helpful. (If resistance is encountered, try the other nostril; the patient may have a deviated septum.) The Swab is directed toward the ear never up wards (Direction ) 8. Allow the swab to sit in plac e for 5 -10 seconds. (Duration ) 9. Rotate the swab several times to dislodge the columna r epithelial cells. Note: Insertion of the swab usually induces a cough . (Dialing ) 10. Withdraw the swab and place it in the collection tube. 11. Place specimen in the refrigerato r (4oC). 12. Remove gloves. 13. Wash hands. 14. Attach completed requisition. 15. Transport to the laboratory.

These can be stored at room temperature until use. Viral collection kits may be obtained from the local/regional laboratory. Collection Notes: Please check the expiration date of the container as out of date swabs will be rejected by the laboratory. Specimens should be collected within 5 days of onset of symptoms, preferably within 48 hours. Sampling beyond 5 days may be considered in patients with persisting or worsening symptoms regardless of age; in young children or the elderly; and in the immunocompromised. 1.3 Specimen Labeling Requirements All specimens must be appropriately labelled with 2 unique patient identifiers and accompanied by a completed requisition with corresponding information. One identifier must be the patient's legal name along with the date of birth and the other can be the medical record number for in-patient and ambulatory care patients or the provincial health card number for referred-in patients. If the patient does not have either a medical record or health card number, other unique identifiers associated with the patient should be used, such as: registered health card equivalent passport number Health Authority invoice number private insurance policy number immigration number physician office's patient chart number Outbreak numbers are provided by local public health and should be clearly identified on the laboratory requisition. The patient/resident setting should be clearly indicated on the laboratory requisition Facility name Inpatient facility name and location (e.g., ICU, floor, etc.).2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 541.4 Specimen Transport Conditions Specimens should be collected and transported on cold packs (4\u00b0C) to the local/regional hospital laboratory as soon as possible. If specimens cannot be shipped to the testing laboratories within 72 hours, specimens should be frozen at -70\u00b0C and transported on dry ice by the shipping laboratory. If -70\u00b0C / dry ice is not available, they should remain at 4\u00b0C and shipped as soon as possible. 1.5 Laboratory Testing Influenza and COVID-19 testing services are available at NSH local/regional hospital laboratories and the IWK Health Centre laboratory. Testing frequency (weekday/weekend) is assessed on an ongoing basis by the testing facilities. Please note that the turn-around time for results may be further impacted by transportation from zonal/regional labs to the testing facility(s). Result inquiries can be directed to your local/regional lab. However, individual COVID-19 test results may also be accessed confidentiality online at Nova Scotia Health PCR COVID-19 Results . Public health surveillance subtyping of influenza virus type A positive samples occurs at the PPHLN Anchor Laboratory at the QEII in consultation with the PPHLN or during a SARI case investigation. Subtyping is performed on a subset of influenza A positive samples based upon the following* criteria: representatives of the influenza season severely ill suspected treatment failure international travel suspected animal-to-human transmission special request There are three main streams of influenza surveillance available: 1. Routine surveillance: Molecular subtyping may be performed at the QEII on a representative number of provincial influenza A positive samples throughout the influenza year. Most influenza A positive samples are shipped to the QEII to be available for selection.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 552. WHO influenza program surveillance: Nova Scotia participates in the WHO influenza program which is offered through the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg. A select subset of influenza positive samples are cultured at the QEII and referred to the NML for strain characterization and/or molecular typing and antiviral susceptibility testing. Preseason isolates, peak and late season influenza positive cases are represented. Select* criteria samples may be cultured for inclusion as well. 3. Case investigation: This may include suspected treatment failure, SARI case investigation or specific special requests through consultation with PPHLN. Local molecular subtyping may be performed with consideration for sample referral to the NML. 1.6 Point of Care Testing (POCT) POCT is defined as medical diagnostic testing performed outside the clinical laboratory in close proximity to where an individual is receiving care or testing. Currently the only respiratory virus POCT testing in use are those used to detect SARS CoV-2. These can be either rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) or molecular based methods. Rapid antigen tests are predominantly used in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings and designed to be self-administered and produce a result in about 15 minutes. While the specificity of these test is high, they are less sensitive than traditional laboratory- based PCR. In symptomatic individuals who test negative, the RADT should be repeated in 48 hours to identify those with early COVID infection. Molecular point of care tests are more sensitive than antigen-based POCTs with data suggesting sensitivity approaching that of lab-based PCR tests. The test can be performed with minimal training and at the point of sample collection. The test also provides a fast turnaround time allowing the result to be acted upon quickly. It is currently limited to clinical settings such as in the Emergency Department or peri operative settings. 1.7 Result Inquiry Turnaround time for results may be up to 48 hours unless impacted by a surge in respiratory testing Result inquiries can be directed to your local/regional lab 1.8 After Hours Consultation The Microbiologist on call is accessible through QEII Locating at 902-473-2222 .2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 562. Lab Procedures for Emerging Respiratory Pathogens and SARI Although the protocol for SARI was initially developed as a response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, its intended use is to facilitate the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections due to both unknown and known respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large scale epidemics. With MERS-CoV, H7N9 and other emerging pathogens, a key factor is the determination of risk based on epidemiologic factors, which is in turn related to exposure in an \"areas of concern\". The initial risk assessment must be completed and SARI alerts should trigger clinicians to \"Think, Tell and Test\" Think about the possibility of an emerging respiratory infection (e.g., novel influenza A virus) Tell the local medical officer of health or local public health official Test for pathogen only after appropriate consultation and based on clinical symptoms 2.1 Laboratory Protocol (\"Figure 8\") In patients with no epidemiological risk factors the most common pathogens should be ruled out before considering an unusual or more highly virulent pathogen. This may be done at the local laboratory or the provincial public health laboratory (PPHL) depending on local capacity and expertise. Specimens to be considered for collection include a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (preferred specimen), For pediatric patients, a nasopharyngeal aspirate is a suitable replacement to a NPS. Pathogens that should be excluded on preliminary testing include: Conventional bacteria (including Mycoplasma 57Conventional respiratory viruses (e.g., human influenza, NPS is the primary specimen type for respiratory viruses including seasonal influenza. However, deeper specimens such as endotracheal secretions or BAL must be collected in cases of severe respiratory infection with negative NPS. A number of Avian Influenza A viruses, including H7N9, have been detected in throat swabs. Recently, H7N9 was only detectable in sputum specimen in 1 of 4 patients. While sputum and throat swabs are not ideal for most influenza viruses, until the ideal specimen for H7N9 can be identified, multiple specimens types should be considered in patients suspected of having Avian Influenza A viruses. Testing: Influenza A and B by RT-PCR with subtyping (H3N2 or H1N1) should be the primary method for detection of influenza (24 hour turnaround time). Respiratory multiplex RT-PCR for parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and adenovirus will be done on negative influenza specimens (48 hour turnaround time) when there is a clinical indication to detect non-influenza viruses. RIDTs should not be used to rule out influenza A. The sensitivity of currently available RIDT for human influenza strains is suboptimal. The performance characteristics of currently available commercial tests for detection of H7N9 are unknown and likely to be poor based on the suboptimal sensitivity of these assays for other Avian Influenza strains. Novel influenza A viruses and the novel coronavirus (e.g., MERS-CoV) are classified as Risk Group 3 pathogens. Routine culturing of specimens from suspect patients should only be considered in public health labs with containment level 3 facilities If more invasive samples are collected, they should be processed for a wide range of pathogens: Bronchial-alveolar wash for all cultures (bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, fungi) Open lung biopsy \u2014 for all cultures, RT-PCR and histology (ensure specimen is not put in formalin for microbiology testing.)2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 582.2 When to suspect the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Limited data suggests that MERS-CoV can present as a co-infection with other viral pathogens. As such, in addition to specimens that are negative for conventional pathogens, those that do have other identified pathogens but are consistent with suspect cases of novel coronavirus based on the PHAC case definition should be tested for the MERS-CoV. The details regarding testing and some control materials for method development are available from the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). To date only a few PPHLs have developed the capacity to test for this pathogen in-house. All other PPHLs will forward the suspect specimens to the NML for further testing. 2.3 When to suspect a novel influenza virus (including H7N9): Influenza viruses that are positive on the initial influenza identification test but cannot be subtyped using RT-PCR should be further characterized. NS will rely on the NML for further characterization. However, given that subtyping assays are usually less sensitive than the identification assays, weak positives may not be able to be typed. Based on local experience, each laboratory should evaluate these on a case-by-case basis in concert with their local clinicians and public health colleagues. Influenza positive specimens outside the influenza season or obtained from patients with a history of exposure animals (e.g., pigs or chickens), should be identified so that they can be submitted to the NML for characterization. NOTE: While initial analysis of in-house assays used by many labs suggest they should be effective in identifying H7N9, it is difficult to determine the effect on the sensitivity of testing. This is particularly true of the performance of commercial assays whose primer sequences are not known. 2.4 If a front-line laboratory suspects a novel respiratory pathogen: The initial tests (as outlined above) would be similar but supplemental testing will be required at the anchor laboratory of PPHLN. If the laboratory is informed by a Public Health representative in the NSH, or the clinician, that a novel respiratory pathogen is suspected, the laboratory should communicate with the clinician to ensure that the following specimens are collected: A second NPS/endotracheal aspirate or BAL to be used for confirmation by the NML A viral throat swab (in viral transport media) \u2014 Several Avian Influenza A viruses including the H7N9 have been detected in throat swabs. Until the ideal specimen can be collected multiple specimen types should be considered Acute and convalescent sera Conjunctival swab if clinically appropriate (in viral transport media)2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 592.5 If a PPHLN laboratory suspects a novel respiratory pathogen: The laboratory director will notify the MOH immediately when a suspect specimen is identified All specimens with suspected novel respiratory pathogens (as outlined below) will be forwarded to the NML for confirmatory testing Specimens suspected to contain a novel respiratory virus will be handled using CL2 with enhanced PPE Primary specimens should be labelled to indicate the requirement for additional precautions Activities involving open containers of infectious material must be conducted in a biological safety cabinet (BSC) When processing primary specimens that may be infectious (e.g., respiratory specimens), enhanced PPE must be worn, including double nitrile gloves, impermeable OR gown, face mask (N95 not required), and eye protection while working in a BSC The centrifugation of infectious material must be carried out in sealed safety cups (or rotors) that are unloaded in a BSC The surfaces of specimen containers, etc. must be surface decontaminated (or placed into a clean specimen bag) before removal from the BSC. Waste bags must be securely closed before removal from the BSC After specimens are processed, decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with a disinfectant in a routine use The laboratory and/or Public Health should also communicate with the PPHLN that a suspect novel respiratory pathogen sample is being transported.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 60Figure 10: Laboratory Testing for SARI (specimen source may vary by Province) Suspect SARI (meets PHAC de nition) Contact MOH Risk Assessment Low High R/O Conventional agents rst Sputum (bacterial \u00b1 Legionella) Nasopharyngeal swab in viral transport media (viral studies1) Aerobic blood cultures x 2 R/O Conventional agents PLUS: Additional nasopharyngeal swab Viral throat swab (in viral transport media) Acute serology Endotracheal secretion, BAL, tissue (not in formalin), etc. if available and appropriateEmpirical treatmentContact the Microbiologist on Call through QEII Switchboard Empirical treatment Consider infectious Disease Consultation1 Contact Contact the Microbiologist on Call through QEII Switchboard for guidance regarding appropriate test2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 612.6 Transportation of Specimens If the case has been linked to another proven case of a novel respiratory virus, or has strong epidemiological evidence to link it with avian influenza or other emerging pathogens like coronaviruses, then the specimen should be handled in the manner described below; otherwise treat specimens as routine clinical specimens: Transport by Land: If the suspected agent is classified as Risk Group 3, use a Type 1A package. (There is a modification possible for transport by air, see below.) Other requirements of the TDG regulations such as training, labeling, marking and documentation apply. Transport by Aircraft: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions (TI) with some additional provisions of the TDG Regulations may be used for the transportation of diagnostic specimens by aircraft. Consignments prepared this way may be transported by road to and from the airport as well. Under the ICAO TI, the shipping name DIAGNOSTIC SPECIMEN, UN3373 must be used for all diagnostic specimens if they may contain influenza Risk Group 3 agent. Diagnostic specimens are exempted from other requirements in the ICAO technical instructions if they are packaged in packaging of good quality, capable of passing a 1.2m drop test. A Type 1A package meets these requirements. A Type 1B package may only be used if it meets the additional ICAO requirements regarding cushioning of the secondary receptacle, drop test and pressure retention capability.2022-2023 Respiratory Response Plan 62Appendix F: Vaccine Information for Health Care Professionals Nova Scotia Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Information: https://novascotia.ca/dhw/cdpc/documents/Publicly-Funded-Seasonal-Inactivated- Influenza-Vaccine-Information.pdf Nova Scotia COVID-19 Respiratory Response Plan 63Appendix G: References American Academy of Pediatrics.
