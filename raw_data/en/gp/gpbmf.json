See the published version at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-023-00737-5.Page 3/24Abstract Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common degenerative joint condition that causes disability and pain in the elderly population. The prevalence of KOA among persons aged 63 or above is approximately 30%. Previous studies have reported the positive effect of Tui-na treatment and the Chinese herbal formula Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng Decoction (DHJSD) for KOA treatment. However, the therapeutic effects of the combination of these two methods are unknown. The current study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the combined therapy of Tui-na and oral administration of DHJSD on KOA using a randomized controlled design. Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, wait-list controlled clinical trial. Seventy study subjects with KOA were randomly assigned to the treatment and wait-list control groups in a 1:1 ratio. Both the treatment and wait-list control groups received eight sessions of Tui-na manipulation for 4 weeks. The DHJSD were given to the study subjects in the treatment group, but not the wait-list group. Outcomes were assessed using the WOMAC score and EQ-5D-5L, a health-related quality of life with 5-level EQ-5D version. Results The analysis of WOMAC scores and EQ-5D-5L in both groups showed statistically signi\u0000cant improvement with time. The mean WOMAC Pain subscale score was signi\u0000cantly lower in the treatment group than in the wait-list control group at week 8 follow up (P=0.048). The mean WOMAC Stiffness subscale score was signi\u0000cantly lower in the treatment group than in the wait-list control group at week 2 and week 8 follow up (P=0.035 and 0.008). The mean EQ-5D index value was signi\u0000cantly improved in the treatment group than in the wait-list control group at week 2 (P=0.022). No signi\u0000cant adverse effects were found during the trial. Conclusion Combined Tui-na and the herbal medication were effective in relieving pain and improving stiffness as well as quality of life (QOL ) in patients with KOA. The combined treatment was generally safe and well tolerated. Trial registration The study was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (website: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04492670, registry number: NCT04492670), registered on 30 July 2020. Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common degenerative joint condition and one of the most common causes of disability and pain amongst the elderly. The prevalence of KOA amongst persons aged 63 or above is 33.0%, and this \u0000gure increases with age [1].Page 4/24According to a recent study conducted in Hong Kong, by the year 2036, it is predicted that 30% of Hong Kong residents will be aged 65 or above [2], implying an estimated 10% of Hong Kong residents may suffer from KOA. Since the morbidity rate of KOA is extremely high in Hong Kong, it is of utmost important for us to establish an effective method to treat KOA. The effectiveness of conventional therapies for KOA is limited for many reasons including an array of adverse side effects and drug resistance from the use of approved pharmacological drugs [3, 4]. Currently, the ultimate solution is surgery but prolonged waiting periods and effectiveness of Total Knee Replacement (TKR) makes this option unfavorable. According to the data in 2021, the 90th percentile waiting time for total joint replacement surgery is approximately 62 months in Hong Kong [5]. Although mortality after primary TKR was low in public hospitals in Hong Kong [6], the probability of the occurrence of the postsurgical pain of TKR is approximately 53% [7]. Historically, traditional Chinese medicine techniques such as Tui-na were used to treat KOA and over the years this method has been re\u0000ned and standardized. Tui-na can relieve the symptoms of KOA due to an increase in local blood circulation in the affected muscles [8]. The effect of Tui-na is well studied and widely reported. It has fewer associated adverse effects than other treatment schemes and is generally well taken by patients. Hong Kong is a \"East meets West\" place in which the Chinese medicine is very popular. Tui-na for KOA is highly demanded but owing to the limited number of Tui-na practitioners, the treatment cannot be fully maximized. There are 18 Tripartite Chinese Medicine Clinic cum Training and Research Centre supported by the Hospital Authority, 13 of them provide Tui-na services, but each Tui-na practitioner is only able to deliver the service to approximately 10 patients per day. With a view of maximizing the treatment effects so that the number of service sessions can be reduced and satisfy the demand, we aimed to explore a complementary treatment, Chinese medicine to Tui-na to increase the synergistic effect. This was predicted to reduce the number and frequency of Tui-na sessions required for KOA patients to be able to observe its effectiveness. Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng Decoction (DHJSD) is a widely used traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of arthritis in Asia [9, 10]. In animal studies, DHJSD has demonstrated signi\u0000cant anti-in\u0000ammatory effects through promoting lymphatic drainage function [11], and it can improve clinical symptoms, knee function and quality of life (QOL ) for patients with KOA by inhibiting cartilage apoptosis [12]. In addition, DHJSD showed a lower risk of adverse events than standard western treatments [13]. There are very limited published reports about the clinical effectiveness of DHJSD. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DHJSD in KOA. During the study, Tui-na was administered to the study subjects in both groups as a supportive treatment. Methodology Study design This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, wait-list controlled trial in patients with KOA. The study subjects were randomized to receive either Tui-na and DHJSD or Tui-na alone for 10 weeks. Study population Study subjects were recruited from the general public via daily outpatient services (Yan Oi Tong - The Chinese University of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Clinic cum Training and Research Centre (Tuen Mun District) and Yan Oi Tong - The University of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Clinic cum Training and Research Centre (Islands District)Page 5/24and advertisements in posters and lea\u0000ets from September 2020 to September 2021. Study subjects interested in participating in the study were referred to or self-approached the study sites to undergo eligibility assessment. They were pre-screened through a telephone interview. Potential study subjects for recruitment to the study had a face-to-face interview arranged to con\u0000rm the eligibility. During the interview, assessors explained the overall objectives and nature of the study, described the informed consent, and assessed the study subjects' eligibility. All study subjects were assessed using Chinese medicine theory by the Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs), and the baseline data on their symptoms and medical histories were recorded. If the study subject had bilateral KOA and both knees ful\u0000l the eligibility criteria, only the most symptomatic knee was treated and evaluated for the outcome assessment throughout the whole study period. Eligibility criteria Study subjects aged 50 years or older, met the criteria of KOA according to the American College of Rheumatology [14], with Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) [15, 16] score 39 or above were recruited and a willingness to participate in the study. We excluded study subjects who had other disorders that might affect the knee (e.g., infection, malignant or autoimmune diseases); who had knee surgery or arthroscopy in the past year; who had knee chondroprotective or intra-articular injection, or received systemic corticoid treatment in the past 4 months; who had local antiphlogistic treatment, acupuncture, physiotherapy in the past 2 weeks; who took anticoagulants, antiplatelets, corticosteroids, psychiatric drugs, hormones, antiarrhythmic drugs or diuretics drug; who had uncontrolled hypertension; who had comorbidities including severe cardiovascular, cerebral, hepatic, renal, or hematopoietic diseases; who had a history of mental illness; or who had allergic reaction to or had drug interaction with the study herbs. Randomization and masking Before randomization, there were 2 weeks screening period for pre-study blood test assessments, and study subjects needed to stop taking antiphlogistic treatment, acupuncture or physiotherapy during this period. Eligible study subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment group and wait-list control group in 1:1 ratio. An independent assessor used the random number function in Microsoft Excel 2019 to generate the randomization sequence. Study subjects were informed of their assigned group. However, Tui-na practitioners and statisticians were blinded to randomization but follow standard operation procedure (SOP). Interventions Treatment group received the standardized Tui-na and DHJSD, while wait-list control group received Tui-na alone during the study period. Study subjects in treatment group underwent 8 sessions of 20 minutes Tui-na with the same manipulation by well-trained independent, blinded Chinese medicine practitioner investigators, and took DHJSD orally twice daily concomitantly over 4 weeks. The wait-list control group only received standardized Tui-na in the same manner of the treatment group but were given the same regimen of DHJSD after the completion of week 8 follow-up assessments at study subjects' discretion. The procedures of Tui-na manipulation are shown in Appendix I. Names and details of acupoints used in Tui-na manipulations are listed in Table 1.

Follow-up visits Both groups are assessed at week 2, week 4 and were further followed up at week 8 (post 4 weeks intervention) with any symptoms of the knee and adverse events being assessed at each visit. All outcome assessments were done before the treatment at each follow up, this was to assess the treatment e\u0000cacy since last treatment instead of the immediate effect. For safety concern, we recorded medical history and adverse events during the interventions and follow-up period, and gave appropriate treatment or referral if needed. Interventions were suspended immediately should a treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Further assessments were needed to decide whether the trial should be suspended. There had a designated hotline for adverse event reporting. Study subjects could call the hotline during o\u0000ce hours but were advised to attend Emergency Department at the nearest hospital during non- o\u0000ce hours if severe adverse event was found. At the end of the intervention, the study subjects received post- study blood tests, included complete blood picture tests, liver and renal function tests for safety monitoring. In order to encourage study subjects' continued compliance, they were contacted by telephone one to two days prior to each visit. For the treatment group who had study medications, leftover packages were counted to monitor each study subject's compliance. The consumption of topical drugs and non-steroidal anti-in\u0000ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rescue medication was also recorded at each visit. Outcome Measurements Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure was rated using the WOMAC in Chinese version [16, 17] at 4 weeks after randomization. The WOMAC is a validated tool for self-administration. It is a 3-dimensional questionnaire that assesses pain, stiffness and physical functional disability in study subjects with KOA using a series of 24 questions. It is a \u0000ve-point scale from 0 to 4 (0=none, 1=mild, Secondary outcome measuresPage 12/24Secondary outcome measured WOMAC in Chinese version at 2 weeks and 8 weeks after randomization. The health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L in Chinese version [18, 19] was also used. Outcomes were documented at 2 weeks, 4 weeks after randomization and follow-up (8 weeks). The EQ-5D-5L is used to assess health-related quality of life and particularly utility values. It shows high responsiveness in study subjects and it can also show important changes clinically [20]. The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises \u0000ve dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that re\u0000ects the study subjects' own judgment. It recorded the study subjects' self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Ethics Consideration The study was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong - New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Review Committee (CREC Ref. No. 2019.538). And the study was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (website: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04492670, registry number: NCT04492670). Study Monitoring A dedicated team from the Hospital Authority Chinese Medicine Department (HACMD) that was completely uninvolved in the running of the study and had no competing interests were responsible for study monitoring. Sample Size Calculation And Statistical Analysis The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome, the WOMAC. We assumed Tui-na combined with DHJSD could have a 20-point superior than the wait-list control group at week 4. According to the previous study, the massage could decrease WOMAC 17.44 with standard deviation 23.61 [21]. The sample size could be calculated according to the following formula The \u00b51-\u00b52 was the difference in means, 2.616. The was 23.61. We de\u0000ne as 0.05 and as 0.1, the t and t were 1.96 and 1.282 respectively. The sample size for each group was 29. Considering 20% drop-out, the total sample size was 70. All e\u0000cacy and safety analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Missing values were imputed by the last-observation-carried forward method. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 27.0. Statistical signi\u0000cance was de\u0000ned as a two-sided P value of <0.05. Baseline characteristics were reported as mean \u00b1SD. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust the potential confounding variables on the outcomes. In this study, WOMAC Stiffness subscale score and WOMAC Physical Function subscale score (shopping) were potential confounding variables that were adjusted. The changes in scores from baseline to the end-point of treatment weren=22(t+t)2 (12)2Page 13/24tested using paired t-test. Within-subject differences were assessed using repeated measure analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) and paired t test for underlying non-normal distributed data. Results Study subjects and baseline characteristics Between September 2020 to September 2021, 117 study subjects were screened according to the inclusion criteria, and 46 (39.3%) were excluded. 71 eligible study subjects were enrolled. 1 was post-randomization excluded due to unavailable treatment appointment. The remaining 70 study subjects were randomly divided into two groups. Out of 70 randomly assigned study subjects, 1 from the wait-list control group was withdrawal due to working reason, all the rest completed the 4-week course of treatment and were assessed at week 8. A \u0000ow chart of this study is presented in Fig. 1. There was no signi\u0000cant difference between the two groups in age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and other demographic characteristics. Baseline characteristics of the study subjects are presented in Table 4. Before treatment, there was no signi\u0000cant difference in WOMAC total scores and the EQ-5D descriptive system as well as EQ VAS between two groups (P>0.05).

SD: standard deviation; BMI: body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). All thirty-\u0000ve study subjects in the treatment group completed the whole Tui-na treatment (8 sessions). In the wait- list control group, 3 study subjects (8.57%) did not receive the whole Tui-na treatment. In the treatment group, 3 study subjects (8.57%) took less than 80% of the prescribed dosage over the study period.Page 14/24All thirty-\u0000ve study subjects in the treatment group were prescribed the basic study medication, DHJSD. Eight of them (22.86%) manifested excessive dampness patterns at the baseline and were prescribed DHJSD with one of them did not manifest this pattern at week 2 and the remaining medication had changed to the basic study medication. Ten of them (28.57%) manifested blood stasis patterns at baseline and were prescribed DHJSD with Tao-ren (Persicae Semen) and Hong-hua (Carthami Flos), one of them did not manifest this pattern at week 2 and the remaining medication had changed to the basic study medication. One study subject (2.86%) manifested both excessive dampness and blood stasis pattern and was prescribed DHJSD with the \u0000ve additional herbs. Primary and secondary outcomes The WOMAC total scores in the treatment group and the wait-list control group were similar at 4 weeks (t = -1.295, P=0.20) with the mean (SD) 37.0 (16.2) compared with 42.1 (16.3) (Table 5). However, the analysis of WOMAC total scores and all the subscales scores in both groups showed statistically signi\u0000cant improvement with time, when comparing baseline versus week 4 and baseline versus week 8 (P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively). On comparison between two groups, the treatment group showed a trend of improvement than the wait-list control group. Table 5 WOMAC and EQ-5D-5L score over time by group, mean (SD) Treatment group (baseline)Control group (baseline)Treatment group (week2)Control group (1.4)* 3.4 (1.5)* Physical Function subscale38.7 40.7 difference between two groups is statistically signi\u0000cant. In addition, there was a statistical difference in mean WOMAC Pain subscale score at week 8 follow up between the two groups (P=0.048). The mean difference (MD) was 1.76 with 95% con\u0000dence interval (CI) of 0.02 to 3.5. The treatment group demonstrated better improvement in pain relief than control group. Besides, there were statistical differences of mean WOMAC Stiffness subscale scores between the two groups at week 2 (MD 0.74, 95%CI 0.05 to 1.42, P=0.035) and week 8 (MD 0.95, 95%CI 0.26 to 1.65, P=0.008).Page 15/24For EQ-5D-5L, the analysis of EQ-5D index values and EQ VAS scores in both groups showed statistically signi\u0000cant improvement with time, when comparing baseline versus week 4 and baseline versus week 8 (P< 0.001). Besides, there were statistical differences of mean EQ-5D index values for the two groups at week 2 (MD 0.17, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.31, P=0.022) (Table 5). As WOMAC Stiffness subscale score and WOMAC Physical Function subscale score (shopping) signi\u0000cantly affected (P=0.014 and 0.026 respectively) the WOMAC scores and EQ-5D-5L between both groups at baseline. ANCOVA was performed to compare the effect of intervention groups the independent variable (treatment group versus wait-list control group) on WOMAC and EQ-5D-5L (dependent variables) separately at 4 different time periods. The ANCOVA results shown that interventions (treatment group versus wait-list control group) were not statistical difference in the mean of WOMAC, EQ-5D index values and EQ VAS scores at week 4 and week8. Additional drugs Both groups showed decreasing consumption of topical drugs and non-steroidal anti-in\u0000ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during treatment. Twenty-one subjects (60.0%) from each group used additional drugs to relieve knee pain at the baseline. After the 8-week trial, only 4 (11.4%) and 5 (14.3%) study subjects consumed additional drugs in the treatment group and the wait-list control group respectively. There was signi\u0000cant difference in time for both groups (P<0.001), but no signi\u0000cant difference between groups (P=0.73). Safety outcomes Adverse events During the 8-week trial, there were no report on serious adverse events. 2 study subjects (5.7%) from the treatment group and 6 (17.1%) from the wait-list control group reported mild local pain in the lower limbs after receiving Tui- na manipulation. There was no signi\u0000cant difference in the occurrence of adverse events between two groups (P= 0.12). Besides, in the treatment group, seven (20.0%) adverse drug reactions were potentially related to the medication, involving change in stool frequency and abdominal distention. All these adverse events were mild and subsided in a short of time without medical care. Laboratory investigations After 4-week intervention, there were few abnormal \u0000ndings in the liver function test. 2 study subjects (5.7%) from the treatment group and 3 (8.6%) from the wait-list control group showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or total bilirubin slightly increased in the blood tests. There was no signi\u0000cant difference in the occurrence of abnormal blood test results between two groups (P=0.62). These study subjects showed no symptoms or signs related to the abnormal liver function and all returned to normal after having re- check blood tests 2 weeks later. For other examinations, there were no signi\u0000cant changes in the vital signs, blood tests including complete blood picture tests and renal function tests after the intervention in both groups. Discussion The present study demonstrated that there was improvement in pain relief, stiffness knee function, as well as QOL in both groups during the 4-weeks intervention. And the improvement kept on going at week 8 followed up. ThesePage 16/24results suggest that Tui-na or the combined treatment have positive effects in terms of WOMAC scores, as well as the quality of life of KOA patients. The treatment group showed signi\u0000cant improvements in WOMAC Pain subscale score at week 8, the results demonstrated Tui-na was effective for immediate relief of pain, while oral Chinese medicine as an add-on effect was effective in long-term pain relief. As herbal Chinese medicine can help to suppress in\u0000ammatory reactions [22] that make the analgesic effect more progressive. Besides, the treatment group showed signi\u0000cant improvements in WOMAC Stiffness subscale score at week 2 and week 8, as the herbal Chinese medicine can protect articular cartilage [23], it may help the joints' motion smoother. But the WOMAC Physical Function subscale score did not show signi\u0000cance add-on effect when compared to the treatment group, it is because the herbal medicine might not alter abnormal alignment and the degenerative process [24, 25]. Tui-na, Chinese massage, is an important part of Tradition Chinese Medicine with more than 2000 years history [26]. It is a treatment based on meridian system. Practitioners use hands and arms to manipulate soft tissue, which stimulate the acupoints and mobilize joints by different techniques of Tui-na such as rolling, kneading and pulling to dredge the meridian system and promote the Qi and Blood circulation [27]. This method was used to treat different disorders, such as muscle weaknesses, and joint pains. Tui-na was included as a component of physiotherapy intervention for KOA in the 2018 Expert Consensus on Step Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis statement in China [28]. It is one of the most popular therapies for KOA because it is a non-invasive treatment and is widely accepted by patients. KOA is a degenerative disease and the most common cause of disability in the elderly [29]. The major symptoms of KOA include knee pain, muscle weakness and loss of joint function. Compare to current pharmacological treatment, Tui-na is more bene\u0000cial to the patients and health care system because of its simple operation, fewer side-effect and lower \u0000nancial cost [30, 31]. Many studies had shown that the effectiveness of treating KOA with Tui-na is without doubt [32-34]. The results in this study are comparable to previous clinical trials. In this study, the quadriceps femoris and knee cap are manipulated. The function of quadriceps muscle is to maintain the stability of knee [35]. The weakness of quadriceps muscle is a common clinical sign for KOAs' patients. The reason why manipulating the muscle is that massaging the quadriceps femoris not only can relieve pain, but also can improve the muscle strength and knee function in KOA patients [36-40]. Increased quadriceps strength also reduces the risk of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis [41]. The underlying mechanisms include: increased lymph and blood \u0000ow of the joint, increased clearance of blood lactate and absorption of in\u0000ammatory substances, promote the metabolism and nutrients supplication of articular cartilage [42-46]. In traditional Chinese medicine theory, there is a theory called muscle-region theory. A large proportion of muscles around the knee belong to the region of Foot Yang-ming. Patients with KOA showed a major damaged in the muscle region of Foot Yang-ming [47]. Hence, by rolling manipulated around this region, pressing and kneading the acupoints around the knee in this study, these can dredge the channels and promote the circulation of Qi and blood around the knee and disperses stasis. As a result, the channels are cleared and warmed [48, 49]. These manipulations were used to reduce swelling, break up adhesions and alleviates pain [26]. Besides, the knee joints were mobilized by rotating it clockwise and anti-clockwise respectively. The joints were then undergone a slightPage 17/24pulling and shaking. These manipulations were used to lubricate the joints, restoring the joints' full range of movement, and help muscle relaxation by stimulating inhibitory re\u0000ex and Golgi tendon organ [50, 51]. In this study, herbal medication, DHJSD, was used as an additional treatment on KOA apart from Tui-na. Various researches on DHJSD have been conducted over these years. It was proved that DHJSD can reduce the swelling volume, the number of in\u0000ammatory cells and in\u0000ammatory factors in joints \u0000uid, relieve synovium pathological changes and suppress in\u0000ammatory signals in rats with induced KOA [52]. The clinical therapeutic effect of DHJSD may explain by its mechanism on inhibition of the in\u0000ammatory reaction in knee osteoarthritis by regulating the micro RNA signal pathway [53]. It is to believe that DHJSD can inhibit chondrocytes apoptosis [54, 55] and promote the progression of chondrocytes [56] in joints' cartilage, thus it slows down the degenerative progress of KOA, and explain the nourishing and tonifying effect of DHJSD. Pattern differentiation is one of the most important principles in the Chinese Medicine therapies. Chinese medicine practitioners analyse patients' signs and symptoms data through observation, listening, questioning and palpation, all information obtained will be summarized and differentiated to different patterns. Chinese medicine is prescribed according to which patterns patients are. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the most common pattern for KOA is kidney-yang de\u0000ciency with excessive dampness and blood stasis [10]. For patients related to kidney-yang de\u0000ciency, they present knee pain with aching pain in lumbar vertebrae, deafness, hair loss, teeth loosen and urinary incontinence. For patients related to excessive dampness, they present knee pain with heavy pain, heavy feeling in the body, pain worse in the rainy days and slippery tongue coating. For patients related to blood stasis, they present knee pain with \u0000xed stabling pain, purple lips and purple tongues [57]. DHJSD is used for patients with KOA related to kidney-yang de\u0000ciency [10]. In our study, DHJSD was the basic formula for the treatment group. DHJSD aims to stop pain by dispelling wind-dampness, nourish the liver and kidney and tonify Qi and blood [58]. According to and release wind-cold. Xi-xin (Asari Radix et Rhizoma) is a warming herb with a remarkable pain-relieving power by disperse cold and wind. Chuan-xiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) and Cu-yan-hu- suo (Corydalis Rhizoma) both belong to blood-invigorating herbs which activate Qi and blood circulation and relieve pain. Research has found that alkaloids in Cu-yan-hu-suo (Corydalis Rhizoma) extracts are responsible for its effect showed (Eucommiae Cortex) and Sang-ji-sheng (Taxilli Herba) are often used in pair in many prescriptions because of their characteristics to tonify liver and kidney and strengthen bones Alba) are tonic herbs to elevate Qi and blood level of the body. Fang-ji with excessive dampness patterns. Fang-ji (Stephaniae Tetrandrae Radix) can delay the progression of KOA by regulating lymphatic drain function [62], while Yi-yi-ren (Coicis Semen) and Cang-zhu Rhizoma) can remove damp, relax muscles and tendon other hand, Tao-ren (Persicae Semen) andPage (Carthami Flos) were added if with blood stasis patterns. The function of Tao-ren (Persicae Semen) and Hong-hua Flos) is to improve microcirculation [64]. For the EQ-5D-5L, there are statistical differences of mean EQ-5D index values for the two groups at week 2. It is believe that DHJSD complementary to Tui-na had improved study subjects' mobility and pain relief, DHJSD might also improve anxiety/depression and contributed to this result. In fact, Fu-ling (Poria) has a Chinese therapeutic effect to calm the Spirit and treat Spirit disturbance symptoms like insomnia and palpitations caused by de\u0000ciency of heart and spleen [63]. Gan-cao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) is traditionally combined with other herbs to treat Zang-zao disorder - a condition associated with disturbed sleep and emotional instability. It is believed that Gan-cao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) treats this by tonifying Qi and nourishing the heart [63]. Certain herbs in DHJSD also showed a sedative pharmacological effect in experiments on animals. Oral administration of Chuan-xiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) decoction to mice and rats has a sedative effect to the central nervous systems and counteracted the stimulation produced by caffeine [63, 65]. Ji-xue-teng (Spatholobi Caulis) has shown rats while Cu-yan-hu-suo (Corydalis Rhizoma) has demonstrated a sedative and tranquilizing effect in rabbits, mice, dogs and monkeys [63]. In this study, the compliance rate was high, possibly because most of the study subjects were elderly and retired, with more time for treatment than those still working. Besides, they all lived close to the clinics, and many of them said that they found the interventions and the setting comfortable. DHJSD complementary to Tui-na for KOA are safe and well tolerated. The adverse events were mild, transient and disappear spontaneously without the need for discontinuing interventions. They are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective way to relieve knee osteoarthritis. There were several limitations to our study. First, neither study subjects nor assessors were blinded to group allocation, possibly resulting in overestimation of the effects of the combined intervention. But it is recommended to have a third party to be assessors in the future studies. Second, there may be a selection bias as study subjects were enlisted through outpatient clinic-based recruitment and advertisements with posters and lea\u0000ets, they were already interested in being active and caring for themselves were more willing to participate. Third, most of the study subjects were women as they are more active in community activities, this may have increased the gender bias. Fourth, the treatment period of only 4 weeks was relatively short; therefore, we cannot assess long-term results. Last, self-rating scales were used as outcome measurements, some study subjects may have recall bias when interpreting results. Further studies are required to carry out in the future. First, this study was conducted on a limited sample. It is recommended to repeat the study on larger samples. Second, increasing the duration of treatments and follow-up can clarify whether the analgesic effect can be progressive. Third, it is suggested to use imaging examination, such as X-ray, Computed Tomography scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can help to make diagnosis and can also be one of the outcome measurements. Fourth, as Tui-na may also improve knee muscle function [36]. It is required to introduce objective outcomes to assess, such as knee muscle strength and balance using the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST) and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Last, as various Tui-na manipulations were used in this study, different manipulations have to be found out each mechanism and therapeutic effect.Page 19/24Conclusion This study aimed to explore the e\u0000cacy and safety of Tui-na and herbal medication for KOA. The trial demonstrated that the herbal medication has add-on effect in pain relief, improving stiffness as well as QOL in patients with KOA and this combined treatment was generally safe and well tolerated. The \u0000ndings highlight the potential of Tui-na and herbal medication as complementary treatment regimens for KOA. Large-scale clinical trials and double-blinded studies are needed to substantiate clinical evidence on the bene\u0000ts of KOA and to identify the mechanisms underlying its e\u0000cacy.
