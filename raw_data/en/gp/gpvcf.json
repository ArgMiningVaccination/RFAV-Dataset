Additional Information Explanatory note 15 List of Acronyms 15 Web Sites 15 Slightly increasing but overall low -level influenza virus detection in BC In weeks 17 -21 (April 24 -May 28), 523/19,693 (3%) specimens tested in BC were positive for influenza virus. Week 17 -21 detections remained below the 5 -year historical (pre-COVID -19 pandemic) average (123/1,252; 10%) but were 2021 (0/8,212; 0%) or 2020 (8/17,966; <0.1%). Week ly influenza positivity show ed overall slightly increasing trend: 2.6%, 2.2%, 2.4%, 2.9% and 3.3% in weeks 17 -21, respectively . Of the 523 viruses detected in weeks 17 -21 in BC, all were influenza A and among those subtyped, all (293/294) were H3N2. The 4th laboratory -confirmed influenza outbreak of the 2021 -22 season was reported in BC in week 21 - an influenza A(subtype unknown) outbreak in a long -term care facility (LTCF). The 5-year historical average number of LTCF influenza outbreaks for weeks 17 -21 was about 4 . Nationally, 8,979/82,791 (11%) specimens tested positive for influenza in weeks 17 -21, of which all but 30 were influenza A. Of 946 influenza A viruses subtyped, all but 31 were H3N2. The test positivity for influenza in weeks 17 -21 nationally was similar to the 5 -year historical (pre -COVID -19 pandemic) average (1,917/20,210; 10%). Of the H3N2 viruses genetically characterized in BC and elsewhere in Canada to date in 2021 -22, all have been the 2a.2 sub -clade. The WHO has recommended that the northern hemisphere's 2022 -23 vaccine strain be updated from the 2a.1 sub -clade used in 2021 -22 to 2a.2 . The most r ecent influenza surveillance report from Australia shows earlier than usual increase in influenza activity, although with percent positivity and hospitalizations comparable to the last 2019 pre -pandemic season . All characterized influenza viruses have been similar to the corresponding 2022 SH vacc ine components , which also include 2a.2 as the representative H3N2 strain. Page 2 of 15 A. Laboratory Surveillance Since the beginning of the 2021 -22 season, commencing October 3, 2021 (week 40), 1,031 (0.6%) influenza viruses have been detected among the 185,790 specimens tested in BC ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ). Of these, 523 detections were reported during weeks 17 (n=114/4,427 specimens tested ; 3% positivity ), 3% positivity ) (spanning April 24 , 202 2 - May 28, 2022 ), indicating overall low - level but slightly increasing percent positivity across this period (Figure 1 ). All detections in weeks 17 -21 were influenza A (523/523 ) and among those subtyped, all but one were A( H3N2 ) (293/294 ). Among 192 ( 37%) of 523 detections during weeks 17 -21 with known age information, 42 were 0 -8 years old, 44 were 9 -19 years old, 52 were 20 -49 years old, 15 were 50 -64 years old and 39 were 65+ years old. Influenza virus detection in weeks 17-21 of 2022 was higher than the same period of 2021 ( 0/8,212 specimens tested ) and the same period of 2020 ( 8/17,966 specimens tested; <0.1%) but below the 5 -year (pre -COVID -19 pandemic) average for weeks 17-21 (123/1,252 specimens tested; 10%) (Figure 2). The BCCDC PHL and some local health authority (HA) laboratories also conduct testing for other non -influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV), including RSV and other pathogens beyond SARS -CoV-2 which is not addressed in this report. RSV percent positivity has decline d since peaking in week 48 and remains below the 5-year historical average in weeks 17-21. EV/RV positivity was stable in weeks 17 -21 and remain ed within expected levels (Figure 2). Among specimens additionally subjected to multiplex testing during weeks 17-21, entero/rhinoviruses (EV/RV) respectively , in weeks 15 -16. Most NIRV detections (at the BCCDC PHL) were among children under the age of 9 years. (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5; Table 1 ). Figure 1.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2021 -22 Page 9 of 15 C. Influenza outbreak report s In week 21 of 2022 , one laboratory -confirmed influenza A(subtype unknown) outbreaks was reported from long - term care facilit ies (LTCF ) in Interior Health Authority (Figure 9, Figure 1 0). This outbreak is the fourth influenza outbreak of 2021 -22 season in BC . By way of comparison, no LTCF influenza outbre aks were reported during weeks 17 -21 of 2020 with a 5 -year historical (pre -COVID -19 pandemic) average of around 4 LTCF influenza outbreaks reported between weeks 17 -21. Across weeks 40 -21, the tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks for the 2019 -20 season was 73 and the 5-year historical (pre-COVID -19 pandemic) average number of reported outbreaks was ~155 (versus 4 in 2021 -22).

National FluWatch (W eek 20, May 15 to 21, 2022 ) Influenza activity has declined slightly from the previous week (week 19), but remains above the epidemic threshold. Influenza activity continues to be reported in almost all regions o f all provinces and territories . In week 20 , 1,793 laboratory detections (1, 781 influenza A and 12 influenza B) were reported . In week 20, 16,316 tests for influenza were performed at reporting laboratories and the percentage of tests positive for influenza in week 20 was 11%. In the past six pre -pandemic seasons (2014 -2015 to 2019 -2020), an average of 3,862 tests were performed , with 3 -9% of tests positive for influenza for week 20. To date this season, 11,064 influenza detections ( 10,918 influenza A and 146 influenza B) have been reported, which is lower than what we have seen historically in the past six pre -pandemic seasons, where an average of 46,356 influenza detections were reported at this point in the season. Among subtyped influenza A detections (n= 2,223 ), influenza of detections in 2021 -22. Among detections with detailed age information, the majority of detections were in indi viduals under the age of 45 years. In week 20, the 2 laboratory -confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported , both in long -term care facilities . To date this season (Aug 29, 2021 - May 21, 2022) 44 laboratory -confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported, of which 22 were in long -term care facilities, 3 were in acute care facilities, 16 were in facilities categorized as 'other' and 3 were in remote or isolated communities. All outbreaks were due to influenza A, of which 21 were due to influenza A(H3N2), 2 were due to influenza A(H1N1) and the remaining were influenza A unsubtyped. The percentage visits to healthcare professionals for influenza -like illness (ILI) was 2% in week 20. The percentage of participants reporting symptoms of fever and cough to FluWatchers decreased in recent weeks to 1% in week 20. report reports.html BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2021 -22 Page 11 of 15 National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) Strain Characterization : From September 1, 2021 to June 2 , 2022 , the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has characterized 121 influenza viruses (116 H3N2 and 5 H1N1) received from Canadian laboratories . Influenza A( H3N2) : Genetic characterization Sequence analysis of the HA gene of these viruses showed that the 106 H3N2 viruses belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a .2. A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2) -like virus is the influenza A/H3N2 component of the 2021 -22 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and belongs instead to genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a .1. A/Darwyn/6/2021 (H3N2) -like virus is the influenza A/H3N2 component of t he 2022 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine and belongs to the genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a .2. Antigenic characterization 116 influenza A (H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized as A/Cambodia/e0 826360/2020 (H3N2) -like to A/Cambodia/e08 26360/2020 (H3N2 )-like virus and 87 egg -grown A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 is the influenza A/H3N2 component of the 202 1-22 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 : Antigenic characterization Five H1N1 virus es were characterized with four antigenically similar to A/Wisconsin/588/2019, and one virus showed reduced titer with ferret antisera p roduced against cell -propagated A/Wisconsin/588/2019 A/Wisconsin/588/2019 is the influenza A/H1N1 component of the 2021 -22 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Antiviral Resistance : The NML conducted drug susceptibility testing on 126 influenza A ( 121 H3N2 and 5 H1N1) viruses received . Oseltamivir : All H1N1 influenza virus es were sensitive to oseltamivir. Zanamivir : All H1N1 influenza virus es were sensitive to zanamivir. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2021 -22 Page 12 of 15 E. International USA ( Week 20, April 10 to 16 , 2022 ) In week 20, seasonal influenza viruses continue to circulate and activity is increasing in parts of the country. Most influenza viruses detected we re A(H3N2) , most of which were genetically related to the vaccine virus but antigenic data shows a majority of the characterized H3N2 viruses were different from the vaccine reference viruses . While the number of B/Victoria viruses circulating this season is small, the majority of the B/Victoria viruses characterized are antigenically similar to the vaccine reference v irus. The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI was at 2% in week 20, below the national baseline . The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza during week 20 (5.7%) was close to the epidemic threshold of 6%. One influenza -associated pediatric death was reported to CDC in week 20. The death was associated with influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed . There has been a total of 25 influenza -associated pediatric deaths so far this season. Of the 65,734 samples tested for influenza from clinical laboratories across the US in week 20, 4,225 (6%) samples were positive for influenza. Of these , 4,210 ( 99.6%) were influenza A and 15 (0.4%) was influenza B positive. The US CDC has posted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly Australia (Weeks 19 -20, May 9 to 22, 2022) In Australia, ILI activity in the community has increased since March 2022. The number of influenza detections reported in this fortnight (n=26,193) was more than three times the notifications in the previous fortnight. In comparison to similar weeks in the previous 5 years (2017 to 2021), the current trend may signal an earlier than usual start to influenza activity. However, the proportion of sentinel laboratory tests positive for influenza observed this fortnight (12%) remained below levels observed during same weeks in 2019 (24%) , the most proximal pre -pandemic year, although, lower levels were seen during similar weeks in 2018 (2%) . The number of reported influenza hospitalizations is above the 5 -year average, but below the tally o f hospital admissions during the same period of the 2019 pre -pandemic season. Ongoing monitoring is required . In the current year to date, there have been 38,743 of laboratory -confirmed influenza reported in Australia, of which 99% were influenza A : 94% were A(unsubtyped), 1% A(H1N1), and 5% A(H3N2) B(Victoria)) antigenically characterised, and the one B(Victoria) virus were antigenically similar t o corresponding vaccine components . In the year to date, detection rates have been highest in people aged 5 -19 years, followed by people aged 20 -24 years and then children aged younger than 5 years of age. There have been three influenza A(unsubtyped) associated deaths reported in 2022 and the median age of deaths notified was 91 years (range: 87 -92 years).

In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere , influenza activity decreased or remained stable. Detections were mainly influenza A(H3N2) viruses and B/Victoria lineage viruses, with some detections of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. In Europe, overall influenza continues to decline with influenza A(H3N2) predominant. In countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was low overall, except in Argentina and Chile. Influenza detections increased in South Africa and Australia. RSV activity increased in parts of Australia and temperate South America and remained at moderate levels in South Africa. In tropical countries of the Caribbean , Central America and South America, low influenza activity was reported with influenz a A(H3N2) predominant . In tropical Africa , influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) predominating followed by influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. From May 02 , 2022 to May 15 , 2022, the WHO GISRS l aboratories tested more than 224,033 specimens. Of these, 23,784 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 23,393 (98.4 %) were typed as influenza A and 394 (1.6 %) as influenza B. Of the sub -typed influenza A viruses, 153 (4.3%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3,427 (95.7 %) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, all 129 (100%) belonged to the B -Victoria lineage. 2021 -22 Page 14 of 15 F.
