For ob - servant Jews, fasting begins the evening before the \"Day of Atonement\" and ends after nightfall the next day. Because they can't eat or drink anything (includ - ing a pain reliever), Jews often suffer crippling head - aches during the daylong fast. Although Muslims only fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, headache is also a well-known problem during the holy month. Michael J. Drescher, M.D., FACEP, associate chief of emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital, recently received funding from the pharmaceutical company Merck and the hospital's medical staff for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Jerusalem, Israel, to investigate whether the painkiller etoricoxib \u2014taken before beginning the fast\u2014could prevent Yom Kippur headache. The results of the research have been presented at several meetings and submitted for publication. \"About 16 or 17 hours into the fast is when the headache occurs,\" says Dr. Drescher. \"Although the cause is unclear, it may be some combination of caffeine withdrawal, dehydration or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). We did a previous study on Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug that worked great, but it's no longer on the market because of safety concerns. Celebrex, a similar analgesic approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not as long- acting, but etoricoxib is longer-lasting than Vioxx, so we made it the subject of our study.\" As yet unapproved by the FDA, the drug is available in Europe and Israel. \"So far, our research has shown that etoricoxib prevented headaches in about two-thirds of study participants who took the drug before fasting,\" adds Dr. Drescher. \"The rest had much milder headache symptoms than in past years, while two-thirds of those who took a placebo experienced the usual headache.\"Fast Relief? Headaches Accompany Religious Ritual The body only synthesizes vitamin D when the sun's ultraviolet rays strike the skin. In a northern state like Connecticut, vitamin D synthesis is reduced because of the angle of the sun's rays. Ultraviolet light has a shorter wavelength than visible light. The ultraviolet B (UVB) rays in sunlight contain more energy than ultraviolet A (UVA) rays and activate the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Most chemical sunscreens block UVB rays and disrupt the body's production of vitamin D. In the 1930s, the government began adding vitamin D to milk to prevent rickets, then a major public health concern. Today, 98 percent of the milk supply in the United States is fortified with the crucial vitamin, vital to metabolizing calcium for healthy bones. Vitamin D may help prevent osteoporosis in older adults, especially in combination with calcium. Vitamin D is found in: fish liver oils and fatty fish (salmon, tuna, and mackerel) fortified cereals and milk trace amounts in egg yolk Obtaining sufficient vitamin D from natural food sources alone can be difficult. Supplements contain both vitamin D 2 and the more potent vitamin D 3. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are strong indications that vitamin D plays a role in the prevention of colon, prostate and breast cancers. Deficient in DThe da Vinci robot combines a sur - geon's skill with the versatility of fiberoptic technology to visualize and navigate the body. In 2003, Hartford Hospital became the first medical center in Connecticut to offer robotic nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery. Hartford Hospital has performed more than 2,000 robotic-assisted procedures, placing it among the top 10 percent of U.S. hospitals by volume of robotic surgeries. Experience is a significant factor in predicting good surgical outcomes. Three additional Hartford Hospital sur - geons are now using the da Vinci robot for a variety of gynecologic conditions, including fibroids and endometriosis. These surgeons join the ranks of three gynecologic oncologists and three urogynecologists who also perform robotic surgery. Hartford Hospital gynecologists have performed hundreds of robotic procedures. Physicians at Hartford Hospital\u2014 the first medical center in the Northeast to use the da Vinci for urogy - necological surgery\u2014are now bring - ing their expertise to hysterectomy. Minimally invasive robotic surgery offers advantages over traditional approaches to vaginal, laparoscopic or \"open\" abdominal surgery to remove the uterus. Smaller scars, reduced pain, less blood loss and shorter recovery times are among the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. Robotic precision is invaluable for gynecologic procedures like radical hysterectomy for endome - trial, cervical or early ovarian cancer. One in three American women will have a hysterectomy before age 60. The most commonly performed major gynecological surgical procedure in the United States, hysterectomy relieves pelvic pain and excessive menstrual bleeding. Benign uterine fibroids can grow as large as a grapefruit, caus - ing pelvic discomfort, pain or pressure Robotic Precision Speeds Hysterectomy on the bladder or other organs. \"The robot assists during closure and repair of the vagina after removal of the uterus (and sometimes the cervix),\" says Frederick J. Rau, M.D., an obste - trician-gynecologist with Physicians for Women's Health. \"The robotic 3D image is very helpful for visualization because we can see many areas of the pelvis with increased clarity.\" Robotic-assisted techniques have revolutionized surgical control, au - tomating complex and repetitive ma - neuvers. Even the steadiest of human hands cannot match those of a surgical robot. Laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" sur - gery allows physicians to insert flex - ible scopes and tools through tiny slits, or \"ports,\" in the skin. Seated at a console, Dr. Rau views images relayed by the fiberoptic camera while manipu - lating robotic controls that turn his hand and wrist motions into real-time movements of the surgical instruments inside the patient. Five million women in the United States suffer from endometriosis, a disabling condition that causes pain and cramping when cells from the uterine lining spread to the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, bladder and bowel. Robotic surgery assists with removal of ovarian masses or complex surgeries involving delicate structures with only a small incision, leading to shorter hos - pital stays. \"Robotic-assisted surgery can be a better choice for women with scarring or pelvic adhesions from prior pelvic surgery or cesarean section,\" says Dr. Rau. \"Patients have significantly less pain and trauma with robotic laparo - scopic surgery compared to open sur - gery. Most patients are home the next day and recovery is usually very quick.\" In addition to Dr. Rau, Hartford Hospital physicians who perform robotic-assisted hysterectomy for gynecologic conditions include: Odin Kuiper, M.D., Women's Health Connecticut, and Peter J. Doelger, M.D., Connecticut Multispecialty Group. For more information or referrals, please call (860) 545-1888 or (toll-free) 1-800 545-7664. 3Beyond Breast Ramon E. Jimenez, M.D., of Hartford Surgical Oncology Specialists (left), and Tim Boyd, M.D., of Hartford Radiation Oncology Associates CancerOffered a choice between breast conservation and mastectomy, most women choose to save their breast. Thanks to breast-conserving surgery and in - novative radiation therapy, a woman whose grandmother would have been scarred by radical mastectomy or older radiation techniques can now expect to enjoy a normal lifespan while preserving the look and feel of her breasts. Every three minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Nearly 90 percent of newly diagnosed women\u2014and 98 percent of those with localized tumors\u2014will be alive in five years. With 2.5 million breast cancer survivors in the United States, breast-conserving surgery is on the rise. Today, more than three-quarters of new breast cancer patients at Hartford Hospital opt for breast conservation, combining lumpectomy (surgical removal of the tumor) with radiation. The alterna - tive is mastectomy (removal of the whole breast), which may be coupled with breast reconstruction. Research shows that long-term survival rates after lumpectomy plus radiation are similar to survival rates after mastectomy, so more surgery does not necessarily confer better long-term outcomes. After lumpectomy, high-energy radiation kills any lingering cancer cells. \"For many years, whole breast radiation was the standard technique used in breast conservation,\" says Tim Boyd, M.D., of Hartford Radiation Oncology Associates. \"Over the past seven years, whole breast radiation tech - niques have been improved, and have been joined by new radiation delivery methods that allow targeting of treatment only to the affected area of the breast, where the chances of cancer recur - rence are the highest.\" More than 600 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will be treated at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center in 2009\u2014a quarter of all the breast cancer patients statewide. Digital mam - mography, coupled with high-resolution MRI for high-risk women, can detect tiny tumors while they're localized and highly treatable. Beyond mere survival, worries about treatment risks, coping, sexuality and self-image are often at the forefront of a woman's concerns as she contem - plates the future. \"There is no breast reconstruction that can completely reproduce a real breast,\" says Ramon E. Jimenez, M.D., of Hartford Surgical Oncology Specialists. \"The main problem is that the nipple-areola complex is removed in a mastectomy, and this is the main sensory and arousal area of the breast. Many women choose breast conservation with the goal of preserving their sexuality and protecting their body image.\" Early Detection Drives Survival Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in U.S. women. Nearly 200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,000 will die of the disease in the United States this year. Only about half of women 40 and older na - tionwide report having a mammogram in the past year, according to the American Cancer Society. Screening rates differ by income level and health insurance status. Although Connecticut boasts a comparatively high rate of mammography utiliza - tion, medically underserved women in the state are less likely to have regular mammograms. Cure rates rise when breast tumors are found earlier through community screening programs like Hartford Hospital's \"Take the Time\" mobile mammography van. Only a quarter of women who develop the disease have any identifiable risk fac - tors, the most common of which is a family history of breast cancer in a mother or sister. Fewer than 10 percent carry a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. In Connecticut, age-adjusted cancer mortality rates are highest for African-Americans, who die of breast cancer more often than whites or Hispanics. African-Americans under age 45 are more likely to have aggressive premenopausal breast cancer and may lack access to mammography. When breast cancer is detected early, patients live longer. \"The majority of women we see at Hartford Hospital are diagnosed at stage I or II, before the cancer has spread,\" says Dr. Jimenez. \"Thanks to widespread mammography, most cancers are still localized within the breast tissue and nearby lymph nodes.\" Seeds of Hope Advances in breast cancer treatment include \"brachytherapy\"\u2014seeding the breast with tiny radioactive targets\u2014or external beam radiation delivered directly to the tumor site. New FDA- approved techniques collectively labeled accel- erated partial breast irradiation (APBI) have been shown to be equivalent to whole breast radiation 5 PHYSICIAN PROFILE Stacy R. Nerenstone, M.D. Stacy R. Nerenstone, M.D., a medical oncologist and president of Oncology Associates, is Board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology. She has served as a principal investigator for national cooperative group research studies in gynecologic oncology patients. Dr. Nerenstone has participated in clinical drug develop - ment, especially in the fields of breast and ovarian cancer. She chaired the Oncology Drug Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2000 to 2002, and contin- ues to serve as a consultant to the FDA. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Brown University, Dr. Nerenstone earned her medical degree at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Following her internship and residency in internal medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, she did her fellowship in medical oncology and clinical trials design at the National Cancer Institute. Since joining Hartford Hospital in 1989, she has chaired the Medical Advisory Board of the Hartford Physicians Association. Dr. Nerenstone serves as president of the Hartford Physician Hospital Organization and is secretary of the medical staff. She has also served on numerous committees of the Gynecologic Oncology Group, a national gynecological oncology research organization. Mother of five, she is a supporter of numerous philanthropic organizations, and enjoys spending time with her fam- ily and traveling with her husband. PHOTO TO COME for local cancer control, although research is still relatively early. While many patients across the country are not even informed about the many treatment options available to them, Connecticut women have one of the highest rates of APBI utilization in the United States. For patients, the main appeal of partial breast radiation is that it shortens the treatment time for radiation delivery. A radioactive \"seed\" of iridium-192 is placed temporarily in the lumpec - tomy site, which is irradiated for approximately 10 minutes, sparing the healthy skin, lungs and heart. \"The high-dose radiation field is 'shaped' to conform to the tissues immediately surrounding the lumpectomy cav - ity,\" explains Dr. Boyd. \"APBI requires placement of a specialized delivery tube, or catheter, within the breast for the duration of treatment\u2014twice daily for only five days\u2014 far shorter than the usual six weeks of conventional radia - tion therapy . APBI is not for everyone, but appears to work well for selected patients.\" \"Practically speaking, only about 20 to 30 percent of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients seeking breast conservation are candidates for APBI,\" adds Dr. Jimenez. \"Although whole breast radiation has been used to treat breast cancer for 40 years, we don't yet know the long-term effects of partial breast radiation. While short- term safety and efficacy data appear encouraging up to now, candidates for breast-conserving therapy should be committed to long-term follow-up for recurrence or toxicity.\" Rays of Healing APBI is rapidly becoming a popular method for minimizing radiation expo - sure to healthy breast tissue. The most common targeted radiation delivery method is the MammoSite, introduced in 2002. A balloon catheter with a single inner channel to load radioac - tive seeds, the MammoSite irradiates about a half-inch rim of breast tissue around the lumpectomy cavity. The balloon is left inflated in the breast, but the seed is deployed only during the minutes of treatment twice a day. The catheter is not painful, and doc - tors easily remove it by deflating the balloon after the five-day treatment ends. Contura is a second-generation APBI balloon delivery device that can be inflated to conform to larger or irregularly shaped lumpectomy cavi - ties. Hartford Hospital was the first hospital in New England to offer the Contura, which has five different lu - mens, or channels, inside the balloon that \"contour\" the radiation dose to the targeted area. The latest FDA-approved brachytherapy delivery device is the SAVI, a \"cage\" design that expands inside the breast to allow radioactive seeds to be loaded through multiple channels. \"The 'eggbeater' is simple but elegant,\" says Dr. Boyd. \"We can shape the radiation field to avoid sensitive structures and prevent skin irritation or injury to the chest wall.\" \"Cosmetic results after APBI can be outstanding, and at times, supe - rior to whole breast radiation,\" adds Dr. Jimenez. \"APBI minimizes radia - tion injury and preserves the normal contour and texture of the breast. Preservation of normal breast archi - tecture also facilitates breast exami - nation over the long term. However, careful patient selection is necessary because it is not for everyone.\" Targeting Tumors with \"Systemic\" Therapies In addition to surgery and ra - diation at the tumor site, systemic therapies include chemotherapy, 6Cancer Center Initiatives The Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center is one of the largest and most comprehen- sive cancer centers in New England. The hospital has established partnerships with federally funded research institutions and nationally recognized medical centers to bring cutting-edge therapies, clinical trials and molecular genetics to regional cancer care. In 2007, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) chose Hartford Hospital as one of 14 hospitals nationwide and the only one of its kind in New England to participate in the pilot phase of an effort to bring state-of-the-art cancer care to patients in community hospitals across the United States. \"We have been recognized as an NCI Community Cancer Center,\" says Andrew L. Salner, M.D., director of the Cancer Program. \"Although basic re - search is important, 85 percent of cancer care is provided in regional centers like Hartford Hospital.\" The National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) pilot encourages community out - reach to underserved populations. \"We're working with community organizations to provide cancer prevention, screening and treatment to reduce health disparities and increase participation in clinical trials,\" adds Dr. Salner. In May 2008, as an outgrowth of the NCCCP grant and its clinical research program, Hartford Hospital began send - ing tumor biospecimens to Florida's H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center for advanced research. Analysis of the molecular and genetic \"fingerprints\" of cancer cells may someday lead to personalized therapies. An unexpected and devastating diagnosis of breast cancer brings many challenging decisions. For more than 10 years, the Cancer Center has offered a free computer-based Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) for breast (and prostate) cancer patients. The hospital's comprehensive breast care program, the Partnership for Breast Care, provides access to specialists with expertise in prevention, early detection, treatment, support and research. Studies suggest that cancer patients treated in a setting of coordinated multispecialty care and clinical research live longer and have a better quality of life. targeted drugs and hormone therapy given by mouth or directly into the bloodstream to kill cancer cells. After years of theory, targeted therapy has been shown to be highly effective in patients whose breast tumors have specific biomarkers. Standard chemotherapy drugs treat cancer by killing cells or by stopping cell division. Because \"chemo\" attacks all rapidly dividing cells throughout the body, healthy cells are also injured during cancer treatment. Metastases, with their far-flung colonies of invad - ing cells, kill most of their victims by unleashing proteins that compromise normal tissue as the cancer grows and spreads. Systemic therapy is given in the hope of eradicating those distant cells before they cause any damage. Molecular genetics is spurring development of targeted \"designer drugs\" for cancer. The first biologic therapy was the monoclonal antibody Herceptin, which blocks the HER2 protein found in up to 25 percent of patients with breast cancer. The drug was approved for \"adjuvant\" breast cancer therapy, which means that Herceptin is given after the primary tumor and selected lymph nodes have been removed, in an effort to destroy any possible remaining cancer cells. Studies show a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence in premenopausal women, who are more likely to be estrogen-receptor negative (ER-) and to be HER2-positive. Women with over - expression of the HER2 gene tend to have more aggressive disease. However, a large clinical trial of Herceptin combined with chemotherapy showed that Herceptin substantially helps to improve prognosis. Newer drugs for advanced HER2+ breast cancer include Tykerb and Xeloda. Most postmenopausal breast cancers are estrogen-receptor positive (ER+), which means that the female hormone estrogen fuels tumor growth. Tamoxifen, the first estrogen-blocking drug, around for four decades, has been associated with an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, and uterine bleeding and cancers. Newer drugs called aromatase inhib - itors (brand names Femara, Arimidex and Aromasin) have different, but not necessarily fewer, side effects than tamoxifen. \"Tamoxifen decreases the risk of a new breast cancer by about 50 percent,\" says medical oncologist Stacy R. Nerenstone, M.D., who is run - ning several clinical trials at Hartford Hospital. \"The aromatase inhibitors may decrease that risk by as much as 80 percent.\" A recent New England Journal of Medicine report showed Femara improved disease-free survival better than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors accelerate bone thinning and can cause arthritis-like pain in the joints, but have been shown to significantly reduce the spread of early breast cancer to other parts of the body. \"The aromatase inhibitors work better than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER+ tumors,\" adds Dr. Nerenstone, \"and five years of Femara after five years of tamoxifen improved disease-free sur - vival, versus stopping the tamoxifen at five years.\" \"Breast cancer afflicts one in eight women over the course of their lifetime,\" says Andrew L. Salner, M.D., director of the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital. \"Over the past 15 years, mortality has dropped by 30 percent, due in part to a substantial improvement in early detection and in part to treatment advances. Breast cancer is no longer a death sentence.\" 7 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & BreakthroughsNight sweats can be disruptive to sleep, causing sufferers to get up to change their soggy sheets in the middle of the night. Although fever is the usual expla - nation, night sweats can result from causes as diverse as menopause, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), medications (especially antidepressants), hormonal disorders, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), infections, tuberculosis (TB), AIDS, lymphoma, neurological condi - tions or idiopathic hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating for no known medical reason). Night sweats may be one of several symptoms that point to a diagnosis of an overactive thyroid. \"Rarely, lymphoma is the cause of night sweats, and is considered in someone with swollen glands and unexplained weight loss,\" says Frances Gurtman, M.D., medical director of the Hartford Medical Group, South Main Street, West Hartford. \"TB typically is seen only in foreign-born individuals and those with impaired immunity related to HIV, sub - stance abuse or immunosuppressive medication. Night sweats may be one symptom of TB infection, along with cough, fever and weight loss.\" In a woman of middle age, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be prescribed if there are no contra- indications and her hot flashes and night sweats are very bothersome. \"I had to get up every night and change the sheets,\" recalls Mary, whose night sweats began when her estrogen levels dropped during perimenopause (when hormones fluctuate before menopause begins). Dr. Gurtman says night sweats are a common complaint in her primary care practice, but \"the majority of the time we can determine the cause from a detailed history and medication review.\" One research study published in the Annals of Family Medicine found that 41 percent of pa - tients in a routine primary care setting reported having experienced night sweats at least once during the preced - ing month. Call your primary care physician if night sweats persist.Sweaty Sleep Pancreatic Prions A Case Western Reserve University study suggests an abnormal protein called a prion is a biomarker of early pancreatic cancer. Mad cow disease results from prion accumulation in the brain, and the study showed that prions also trigger aggressive growth in pancreatic tumors. Prions may someday provide a diagnostic marker to predict survival and offer thera - peutic targets in pancreatic cancer patients.DASH Diet Eating whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat and nonfat dairy foods, lean meats, nuts and seeds, and low-sodium foods reduces high blood pressure, while cutting the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. Now the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology says Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) can also reduce the risk of de - veloping kidney stones.Fall Risk Short-acting anti-anxiety drugs may be a safer choice for seniors, say French researchers. In elderly men and women taking long-acting benzodiazepines, the risk of falling was 1.4 times higher than in an age-matched group. Fall risk was also higher in older adults who regularly used mood-altering psychotropic medications, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and some antihistamines.Hep C Disparity Duke University researchers say a tiny gene variation may explain why treatment for chronic hepatitis C infec - tion works better for whites than for African-Americans. Although people of European ancestry are more likely to have the gene variant, African-Americans with the mutation also respond better to treatment. An es - timated 170 million people worldwide are infected with chronic hepatitis C, which can lead to liver failure. 8As autumn arrives, athletes converge on soccer fields, locker rooms and indoor sports arenas, oblivious to potentially deadly bacteria. Hot, moist locker rooms strewn with crumpled towels and shared sports equipment raise the risk of infection. Artificial surface playing fields leave athletes vulnerable to scrapes and \"turf burns\" that can lead to bacterial skin infections. The emergence of virulent pathogens resistant to first-line antibiotics has made managing common bacterial skin infections more difficult than in the past. Worldwide, many strains of hospital-acquired Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to widely prescribed antibiotics. Staphylococcus bacteria\u2014\"staph\" for short\u2014have evolved into difficult-to- treat strains like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains have swept sports teams, sidelining professional athletes and killing otherwise healthy teenagers. CA-MRSA skin infections are asso - ciated with the 5 \"C \"s\u2014contact, con- taminated items, c ompromised skin, cleanliness and c rowding. \"These five elements define most locker rooms,\" says Jack W. Ross, M.D., director of the Department of Infectious Disease at Hartford Hospital. \"Skin-to-skin contact is the most common route of community-acquired infection.\" Any scrape, abrasion or break in the skin should be covered and monitored to avoid spreading a bacte - rial infection from person to person. \"Abrasions from artificial turf have been linked to a higher incidence of drug-resistant infections,\" adds Dr. Ross. \"We successfully treat most CA-MRSA skin infections we see in the clinics with outpatient, older oral antibiotics.\"What Lies BeneathWhatever the cause\u2014over-prescribing antibiotics for routine infections or overuse of antibacterial disinfec - tants in consumer products\u2014resistance is frighteningly real. Always fairly aggressive, staph is now more virulent and less susceptible to treatment. Even vancomycin\u2014the once-invincible antibiotic\u2014has developed extremely rare resistance. Several novel drugs are available to treat serious infections. \"Newer drugs are more expensive, but the faster we treat and cure the patient, the more cost-effective the thera - py,\" says infectious diseases specialist Michael D. Nailor, Pharm.D., who recently joined Hartford Hospital as a clinical pharmacist working with physicians to treat infections and prevent antibiotic resistance. \"Our goal is to enable patients to leave the hospital not only cured, but as quickly as possible.\" Bactrim and older drugs derived from tetracycline, such as minocycline, remain very effective for abscesses, boils, and other pus-filled lesions. \"Younger patients with CA- MRSA skin infections who aren't injection drug users usually don't need hospitalization,\" says Dr. Nailor, whose role is to measure outcomes, prevent infections and treat infectious diseases, including H1N1 influenza, seasonal influenza, HIV/ AIDS and MRSA. \"However, serious infections often require initial hospitalization and prolonged antibiotic treatment.\" Experts warn that antibacterial liquid soaps may promote resistance over time. Rubbing alcohol and weak bleach solution kill bacteria on surfaces just as well as broad-spectrum disinfectants without promoting antibiotic resistance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using hand sanitizer or simply washing hands thoroughly with ordinary soap and warm water to prevent infection.Deadly Infections Lurk Beneath the Skin 9Mental Myths and Misnomers -What's in a Name? \"Borderline Personality\" Early psychiatrists coined the term bor - derline to describe people thought to be on the \"border\" between psychosis and neurosis. Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by volatile emotions, unstable relation - ships, self-mutilation (cutting), violent mood swings, risky sexual behavior, substance abuse, binge eating or feel - ings of emptiness. Most cases occur in adolescent women, often as the result of childhood trauma or sexual abuse. The Hollywood version of the memoir Girl, Interrupted added to the confusion by evoking parallels between a frantic young woman locked on a 1960s-era hospital ward and Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. Treatment for borderline personal - ity disorder includes long-term psycho - therapy and mood-stabilizing drugs.Misconceptions about mental health and psychiatric terminology abound in popular culture. From the horrifying depiction of mental hospitals in the 1940s-era Snake Pit to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Hollywood has fed the popular imagina - tion with fantastic scenarios and frightening distortions. Founded in 1822, the Institute of Living (IOL) offers a permanent, museum-quality exhibition, Myths, Minds, and Medicine: Two Centuries of Mental Health Care, which reveals the dramatic changes that have occurred over the past two centuries in our perception and attempts at treatment for people afflicted with mental disorders. \"Split Personality\" Schizophrenia is not a split personal - ity, despite what many people believe. Instead it is a disorienting mental ill - ness that snarls the brain, creating delu - sions, hallucinations, bewildering voices and disordered thinking. The first plunge into a psychotic episode in young adult - hood often signals the beginning of a long descent into a lifetime of mental illness. The portrayal of Nobel prizewin - ning economist John Nash in the film A Beautiful Mind, while factually inac - curate, showed a fascinating interplay between mathematical genius and men - tal illness. Sophisticated functional MRI (fMRI) imaging at the IOL's Olin Neuro - psychiatry Research Center is illuminat - ing how the brain goes awry. The IOL is studying cognitive and pharmacological strategies for schizophrenia, includ - ing early intervention, treatment with antipsychotic medications, group and individual therapy, and family support.Amnesia Although amnesia is extremely rare, total memory loss is a favorite cin - ematic plot device. From the 1940s-era Spellbound to the oddball Desperately Seeking Susan and the silly Overboard, Hollywood regularly ignores accuracy in the interest of storytelling. Contrary to popular notions, a bump on the head al - most never causes amnesia. \"Retrograde\" amnesia impairs the ability to recall the past, while \"anteretrograde\" amnesia turns life into a series of immediate events by preventing the formation of new lasting memories, ludicrously de - picted in 50 First Dates. Although flawed, the gripping film Memento is a fairly realistic portrayal of anteretrograde amnesia. The movie was apparently inspired by the famous case of Henry Molaison, known as H.M., who lost the ability to form new memories after a part of his brain called the hippocam - pus was surgically removed to relieve seizures. Only in movies do people wake up saying, \"Who am I?\" Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck in Spellbound \u00a9John Springer Collection/CORBISLouise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest \u00a9Cinema Photo/CORBIS Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted, a Mangold \u00a9Corbis Sygma/CORBIS 10Mental \"Multiple Personality Disorder\" Some experts theorize that childhood trauma causes victims to dissoci - ate, or disconnect, from awareness of their fear in order to survive. Formerly known as \"Multiple Personality Disorder,\" Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is believed to arise before the age of 12 (often before age 5) as a psychological escape from severe physical, sexual and/ or emotional abuse. Joanne Woodward won an Academy Award for her ground - breaking portrayal of MPD/DID\u2014the unlikely result of a single traumatic event\u2014in the 1957 drama Three Faces of Eve. Most people's ideas about the disorder come from the shocking 1976 TV movie, Sybil, which recounted the story of a young woman who developed more than a dozen different personali - ties. Tape-recorded sessions with her psychiatrist later revealed that Sybil's so-called memories may have been false. \" Sybil was mostly fiction,\" says David F. Tolin, Ph.D., director of the IOL's Anxiety Disorders Center. \"There's a lot of controversy about the existence of MPD/DID.\" Showtime recently launched a ridiculous comedy series, United States of Tara , about a suburban mom who sup - posedly has MPD/DID.\"Manic Depression\" Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression , causes cyclical mood swings, from euphoria to disabling depression, separated by periods of relative calm. Some individuals experience psychotic symptoms during manic phases that are treated with mood stabilizers and anti- psychotic drugs. Some experts believe that bipolar disorder, often linked with creativity, disproportionately afflicts artists and poets, from Vincent Van Gogh to Silvia Plath. Kay Redfield Jamison's memoir, An Unquiet Mind, brought worldwide attention to the disorder . A 2002 movie, The Hours, opens with writer Virginia Wolff's suicide and, in flash - backs, shows her efforts to finish her novel while navigating an inner dark - ness, vaguely referred to in the movie as \"moods,\" but which seems to fit the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder.\"Neurotic\" Obsessions People who suffer from obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) endure hours of repetitive rituals like hand washing, counting, checking and cleaning in an attempt to control intrusive thoughts. An anxiety disorder, OCD typically begins during adolescence and early childhood. OCD afflicts the quirky but lovable TV detective, Monk, who is often shown visiting his psychiatrist. In the 1997 romantic comedy As Good As It Gets, Jack Nicholson plays a reclusive writer whose OCD makes him lock and relock doors, avoid sidewalk cracks and eat at the same restaurant every day, until he eventually falls in love and begins taking medicine for the disorder. Neuroscience suggests that abnormal brain activity causes OCD, which can be treated with medication and cognitive- behavioral therapy to change thought patterns and behavior.

Non Profit Organization U.S. Postage PAID Hartford, CT Permit No. 436180 S e y m o u r St r e e t Ha r t f o r d , Ct 06102-5037 Cook's Circle Address Service Requested This wholesome soup is a tangy blend of carrots and ginger. Inspired by the flavors of India, carrot ginger soup is a sweet and spicy complement to crusty French bread or Indian naan flatbread. Carrots are rich in vitamins, miner - als, phytochemicals and fiber, yet low in calories and fat. Carrots contain the cancer-fighting antioxidants beta caro - tene and lycopene, vitamins A, K and B6, potassium, calcium and other trace minerals. The vitamin A (beta-caro - tene) and lutein in carrots have been shown to improve vision and protect against age-related macular degenera - tion, the leading cause of blindness in older adults. Ginger root has long been believed to promote healing and protect against disease. The sweet, pungent stem of the Zingiber officinale plant has been used in Chinese herbal medicine for more than two thousand years to soothe upset stomachs, boost energy, aid diges - tion and stimulate the appetite. Some women swear by ginger as a natural remedy for hot flashes. Research has shown that ginger relieves heartburn, seasickness and motion sickness, and eases nausea in cancer patients under - going chemotherapy.Calories: 118 Protein: 3 g Fiber: 4 g Total Fat: 3.6 g (70% monosaturated) Cholesterol: 0 mg Vitamin A (RAE): 287 mcg (41% of daily needs) Sodium: 50 mg Recipe analyzed by Brunella Ibarrola, MS, RD, CD-N.Ingredients 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 inch ginger root, minced, to taste 1 Tbs. extra virgin olive oil1 potato, chopped (optional) 2 ribs celery, chopped (optional) 3 carrots, cut into chunks 1 qt. fat-free, sodium-free organic vegetable broth 1 tsp. coriander1 bay leaf dash salt and pepper, to taste In a large saucepan, saut\u00e9 onion, garlic, ginger and oil together on high heat until onions are translucent.
