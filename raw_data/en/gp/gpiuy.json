In the last two decades, metabolomics are consid- ered important tools to be applied and utilized tounderstand the biology of an organism and its re-sponse to environmental stimuli or genetic per-turbation. Metabolomics (a flowchart is shown inl \"Fig. 1 ) was originally proposed as a method of functional genomics [1], but its utility extendswell beyond that -it is useful whenever an assess- ment of changes in metabolite levels is needed.Metabolomics (or metabonomics) is used for as-sessing responses to environmental stress [2,3],comparing mutants [4] and different growthstages [18,19], for discovery, [8 Indeed, metabolomics is thestudy of global metabolite profiles in a system(cell, tissue, or organism) under a given set of con-ditions and has its roots in early metabolic profil-ing studies, but is now a rapidly expanding field ofscientific research, which has justifiably taken itsplace alongside genomics, transcriptomics, andproteomics as one of the latest and most exciting \"-omic \"sciences [23]. The global metabolite profiling involves measuring low molecular-weight metabolites (< 1 kDa) in complex bio-fluids/tissues to study perturbations in responseto physiological challenges, toxic insults, or dis-ease processes [24]. Metabolites are the end prod-ucts of cellular regulatory processes and can beregarded as the ultimate response of biologicalsystems to control genetic or environmentalchanges [25]. A deeper understanding of globalperturbations in biochemical pathways in com-plex diseases could provide valuable insightsabout the mechanisms of disease. In addition, me-tabolomics has the potential to enable mapping ofearly biochemical changes in disease and henceprovide an opportunity to develop predictive bio-markers that can trigger earlier interventions.TCM, a complex medical science, reflects tradi-tional Chinese culture and philosophical princi-ples, embodies rich dialectical thought, placesthe human body into a large system for observa-tion and adjusts humans to remain in a healthystatus. Entering the 21st century, TCM is gettingAbstract ! Metabolomics represent a global understandingof metabolite complement of integrated livingsystems and dynamic responses to the changesof both endogenous and exogenous factors andhas many potential applications and advantagesfor the research of complex systems. As a systemicapproach, metabolomics adopts a \"top-down \" strategy to reflect the function of organisms fromthe end products of the metabolic network and tounderstand metabolic changes of a complete sys-tem caused by interventions in a holistic context.This property agrees with the holistic thinking ofTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a complexmedical science, suggesting that metabolomicshas the potential to impact our understanding of the theory behind the evidence-based Chinesemedicine. Consequently, the development of ro-bust metabolomic platforms will greatly facilitate,for example, the understanding of the actionmechanisms of TCM formulae and the analysis ofChinese herbal (CHM) mineral medicine, acu-puncture, and Chinese medicine syndromes. Thisreview summarizes some of the applications ofmetabolomics in special TCM issues with an em-phasis on metabolic biomarker discovery. Abbreviation !

Chinese medicine isnot yet an integral part of the standard healthcare system inWestern countries due to a lack of scientific evidence for its effi-cacy and safety as well as a language and cultural barrier [27].Fortunately, metabolomics adopts a \"top-down \"strategy to re- flect the function and metabolic changes of complete organismscaused by interventions in a holistic context. This property coin-cides with the holistic thinking of TCM and has the potential toimpact our understanding of Chinese medicine theory. Recently,a wide range of metabolomic analytical techniques are widelyused in the modern research of TCM. Metabolomic analysis willfacilitate the modernized study of TCM syndromes, provide anin-depth understanding of the TCM theory, help predict the dis-ease on-set and achieve a comprehensive evaluation of clinical ef-ficacy, safety, and action mechanisms of TCM formulae. Metabo-lomics combined with TCM methodologies will provide a newpathway and methodology for the study of complicated systemstheory of TCM and its modernization. Especially the advances inthe high-throughput and comprehensive research technologiesand the idea of metabolomics provides new strategies for theanalysis of active components in the formulae of TCM in vivo .F u r - thermore, the initiatives of metabolomics may pave a new way toexplain the action mode of TCM in light of modern sciences andso contribute to establish a new technique platform for evaluat-ing the efficacy of the TCM formulae. It is believed that with thefurther development of metabolomic analytical techniques, espe-cially multi-analysis techniques, metabolomics will greatly pro-mote TCM research and be beneficial to its modernization as wellas establish international standards for it. Thus, we draw atten-tion to applicable approaches of using metabolomic techniquesto resolve special TCM issues and focuse particularly on the po-tential of metabolomics to contribute to biomarker discovery inTCM research.Advantages of Metabolomics ! The study of biological systems in a holistic manner (systems bi-ology) is increasingly being viewed as a necessity to providequalitative and quantitative descriptions of the emergent proper-ties of the complete system. Systems biology performs studies fo-cused on the complex interactions of system components, em-phasizing the whole system rather than the individual parts.Metabolomics is one functional level tool being employed to in-vestigate the complex interactions of metabolites with other me-tabolites but also the regulatory role metabolites provide throughinteraction with genes, transcripts, and proteins (e.g., allostericregulation). Technological developments are the driving force be-hind advances in scientific knowledge. Recent advances in thetwo analytical platforms of mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclearmagnetic resonance spectroscopy have driven of -32]. Technological advances in NMR and mass spectrometry have opened a new chapter in bio-chemistry by using metabolomics as an approach to study me-tabolism and its regulation in relation to genetic, disease, and en-vironmental factors. NMR is one of the most commonly usedtechnologies in metabolomics research, providing detailed infor-mation on the molecular structure and probing metabolite mo-lecular dynamics and mobility [33]. The high selectivity of massspectrometry with low-detection limits makes mass spectrome-try an ideal tool for metabolomic applications. It requires separa-tion of the metabolic components using either gas chromatogra-phy after chemical derivatization or ultra-performance liquidchromatography (UPLC). UPLC/MS is used to thelargest possible biochemical profile information subset. It is asensitive tool that can be used to characterize, identify and quan-tify a large number of compounds in a biological sample wheremetabolite concentrations might cover a broad range of informa-tion with regard to disease pathophysiology [34 -36]. All studies result in complex datasets that re-quire visualization software as well as chemometric and bioinfor-matic methods for interpretation. The application of softwaretools for the analysis of the information contained in a databasecan identify the signature of a disease and predict its risk andprogression.One of the major benefits of metabolomics in the study of diseaseand drug therapy is that metabolic profiling can usually beachieved using urine or plasma samples. The accessibility of urineand plasma clearly makes these samples ideal for large-scale re- Fig. 1 Flowchart of metabolomic analysis.2027 Zhang A et al.

Metabolomics data can be analyzed with a range of statistical and machine-learning algorithms. These algorithmscan be classified within two major classes: unsupervised and su-pervised [38]. They can be useful in the identification of bio-markers [39,40]. Examples of unsupervised methods that havebeen routinely used in analyzing molecular fingerprinting datainclude principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizingmaps [41].Metabolomics has become useful in many medicine areas as anaid to disease diagnosis or staging and as a tool to predict or mon-itor treatment response or toxicity. Considerable interest in thefield of metabolomics is that of personalized health care, where-by an individual s drug treatment is tailored so as to achieve max- imal efficacy while avoiding adverse drug reactions. Anothermore recent approach has been to use metabolomics to predictthe metabolism of a dosed substance based on a pre-dose meta-bolic profile [42]. Metabolomics holds a comprehensive and non-invasive analysis of metabolic biomarkers that could detect early-stage disease, identify residual disease post-surgery and help tomonitor treatment response. Additionally, metabolomics can beseen as bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype, pro-viding a more comprehensive view of how cells function, as wellas identifying novel or striking changes in specific metabolites[25,43]. In the future, metabolomics may enable us to developnew approaches for improving the health conditions of humanbeings and preventing or healing diseases, and is especiallyshowing great advantages in early and combination intervention,personalized therapy, etc. [44,45]. Challenges for TCM ! TCM has been practiced for thousands of years and the writtendocuments showed sophisticated theories for TCM even in itsearly forms although these theories were established on a philo-sophical basis and clinical experiences rather than science per-haps owing to the fact that this medical system had been devel-oped well before modern science was born. Like almost all othertraditional medicines, the practice of TCM suffers, at present,from insufficient modern scientific research. For example, manytreatments of TCM are still practiced in their original form, andalthough they have been effective in the therapy of many condi-tions, especially chronic ones, they lack the necessary definitionof a molecular mechanism and sometimes even of a molecularbasis. Prescribed medicines in TCM are normally mixtures of a number of plants, and their composition is not well defined.There have been many recent attempts to address these issuesbut most of them were still based on the \"reductionism \"philoso- phy. Therefore, there is a clear urgency of scientific research interms of quality control, clinical efficacy, and molecular mecha-nisms of traditional medicines, which undoubtedly demands asignificant amount of analytical power and effort. Metabolomic Applications of TCM ! Metabolomic evaluation of formulae Wang et al. evaluated metabolomic characters of the hepatotoxic-ity induced by alcohol and the intervention effects of Yin ChenHao Tang (YCHT), a classic traditional Chinese of jaundice and liverdisorders in China [46]. The greatest difference in metabolicprofiling was observed in alcohol-treated rats compared withcontrol and YCHT-treated rats ( of positive ions, m/z664.3126 (9.00 min), was elevated in the urine hol-treated rats, whereas ions with m/z 155.3547 (10.96 min) 708.2932 (9.01 min) were at a lower concentration com-pared with those in the urine of control rats. However, the num-ber of these ions was not statistically different between controland YCHT-treated rats ( l \"Fig. 3 ). The ion m/z 664.3126 was found to correspond to ceramide (d18:1/25:0), providing furthersupport for an involvement of the sphingomyelin signaling path-way in alcohol hepatotoxicity and the intervention effects ofYCHT ( l \"Fig. 4 ). More recently, Wang et al. explored the excretion pattern of low molecular mass metabolites in the male Wistar-derived rat model of kidney yin deficiency induced with thyrox-ine and reserpine as well as the therapeutic effect of Liu Wei DiHuang Wan (LW), one of the most important Chinese formulasconsisting and widely used in eastern Asia fortreating kidney yin deficiency in China [47]. The results showedthat the changes in metabolic profiling were restored to theirbaseline values after treatment with LW according to the PCA Fig. 2 Resulting score plots from PCA of reversed- phase UPLC ESITOFMS data obtained from ( A) control rats, ( B) alcohol-treated rats, ( C) YCHT- treated rats urine samples collected from day 7.Symbols: control rat ( ), alcohol-treated rat (\u00d7), and YCHT-treated (+).2028 Understanding ...Planta Med 2010; 76: 2026 -2035Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. score plots ( l\"Fig. 5 ), indicating 20 ions (8 in the positive mode, 14 in the negative mode, and 2 in both) as \"differentiating metab- olites \"(l\"Fig. 6 ). PCA score plots separated urine samples into different blocks, and samples subjected to the same treatmentwere located on the same trajectory, indicating that treatmentshave greatly disturbed the normal urine metabolic profiles ofrats. There were different phenotypes of metabolites based onHPLC UV urinary profiling after administration of LW pills or car- rageenan-stimulated inflammation model, and those could beconveniently discriminated by PCA. In addition, the results alsoshowed that LW Pills could restore the metabolite network thatwas disturbed by inflammation, which would be a proof of thetherapeutic efficacy of LW pills on inflammation from a metabo-lomics study [48]. A urinary metabolomics method based on theUPLC MS was used to evaluate the efficacy and study the action mechanism of Xindi soft capsules, consisting of sea buckthornflavanoids (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin), ( Salvia myocardial ischemia byreversing potential biomarkers to sham levels, especially for in the of purine and allantoin) [50]. Damage of mito-chondria, disorder of energy metabolism, and osmoregulationwere observed in a cyclophosphamide-caused blood deficiencymodel by an NMR-based method. Siwutang, a Metabolomic analysis of CHM CHM has long been used for disease prevention and therapy inChina and is becoming increasingly important in the West [52].Herbal medicine has been the source of many drugs used in mod-ern therapeutics, and particularly in the case of anticancer drugs,more than 50% originally came from natural products. However, Fig. 3 Resulting loadings plot from PCA of re- versed-phase UPLC ESITOFMS data obtained from control rats, alcohol-treated rats, and YCHT-treatedrats urine samples collected from day 7.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. due to the painstaking way of conventional lead-finding, the at- tention towards CHM has been deviated in the last decades. Anew strategy for the detection of active compounds is necessaryto get natural product research out of its stalemate. Metabo-lomics, with its holistic approach and the possibility it providesfor the simultaneous detection of all sorts of metabolites, hasthe potential to be instrumental for this new approach. A com-bined GC/MS and LC/MS metabolic profiling strategy indicatesthat Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F caused a time-dependent toxic effect at a high dose as revealed by the perturbed metabolicregulatory network involving disorders in energy metabolism,elevated amino acid, and choline metabolism pathways, as wellas altered structure of gut flora [53]. Urinary metabolic perturba-tions associated with liver toxicity induced by Huang-yao-zi (rootofDioscorea bulifera L.) were studied using NMR to determine the correlations between metabolomic profiling and histopatholog-ic/biochemical observations and to discover biomarkers for livertoxicity, indicating metabolic changes observed in urine samplesin response to Huang-yao-zi treatment. In addition, the mecha-nism associated possible biomarker of Rhizoma Coptidisin rat urine. 169 kinds of biomarkers were found. The result was consistent with the pharmacological effects of R. Coptidis, such asanti-inflammatory, anticentral nervous system, and energy me-tabolism inhibition [55]. Berberine might play a pivotal role inthe treatment of type 2 diabetes through downregulating thehigh level of free fatty acids. Comprehensive metabolomic mea-surements are potentially very useful for studying the mecha-nisms of action of traditional Chinese medicines [56]. CombinedNMR and LC DAD MS analyses reveal comprehensive for nonselective and comprehensive analysis of Ginkgo extracts, which are very complex mixtures prepared from rawleaf extracts by a series of extraction and prepurification steps[58]. Ginkgo biloba leaves exert multidirectional lipid-lowering effects on the rat metabonome, including limitation of the ab-sorption of cholesterol, inactivation of HMGCoA, and favorableregulation of profiles of essential polyunsaturated fatty acid [59].Recently, changes of metabolites in rat urine after treatment withAristolochia fangchi decoction by Aristolochia fangchi can induce nephro- toxicity, and its seriousness corresponds to the duration of ad- Fig. 5 PCA score plots of urine samples collected from different treatment groups of rats ( a) in nega- tive ESI mode Med 2010; 76: 2026 -2035Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ministration. Aristolochia fangchi may also have toxicity on the liver. The results suggested that this metabolomic approach is apromising methodology for the rapid in vivo screening of associated with [61]. Aristolochic acids, naturally present inAristolochia plant species that have been used in CHM containing a mixture of varying herb species, were identified by UPLC MS- based methodology [62]. A LC/MS metabolomics approach wasapplied to characterize the aging of rats and the antiaging effectof total flavones of Epimedium , a traditional Chinese medicine, in- dicating that aging could be characterized by changes of lipid me-tabolism and accumulation of free radicals. The antiaging effectsof total flavones of Epimedium might be due to the intervention on lipid metabolism and its property of antioxidation [63]. Phe-notype of aging at different levels demonstrates a common age-dependent trend. Epimedium flavanoids can reverse this age-de- pendent change at different levels in a synchronous manner [64].The total flavones of Epimedium administration can markedly in- fluence the aging process and exert antiaging effects, whichmight due to the melioration of pyruyate metabolism and oxida-tive phosphorylation [65]. Significant differences in endogenousmetabolite profiles were observed in the intervention rats, andthe abnormality of metabolism recovered towards the normallevel after administration with Epimedium brevicornum extract.Four active constituents of Epimedium brevicornum Maxim were found in the blood circulation of kidney-deficient rats and two ofthe metabolites in the urine. It suggests that the metabolomic ap-proach is a potentially powerful tool to explore the therapeuticbasis and to clarify the possible action mechanism of TCM herbs[66].Metabolic changes in Wistar rats caused by mesaconitine, and hypaconitine, which are the maintoxic components of the traditional herbal medicine Fu Zi ( Aconi- tum carmichaelii Debx.) were investigated by means of integrated analysis of two metabolomic approaches. Metabolites with sig-nificant changes or with a tendency to change in the aconitineand mesaconitine groups were dissimilar, suggesting a possibledifference in the acute toxicity mechanisms of these alkaloids[67]. A metabolomic investigation of intoxication with Aconitum sp. alkaloids was carried out: they can cause metabolic disorders in rats. The toxicity and corresponding mechanism of hypaconi-tine was different from those of aconitine and mesaconitine,based on the differences of perturbed metabolic patterns be-tween groups [68]. The effect mechanism and potential bio-markers of the toxicity of Hei-Shun-Pian, the processed carmichaelii Debx. (Ranunculaceae), on the met- abolic of rats, suggests a toxic effect of Hei-Shun-Pian onthe rat heart in a dose-dependent manner [69]. Artemisia afra Fig. 6 Component loadings in ( a) negative ESI mode and ( b) positive ESI mode.2031 Zhang A Understanding ...Planta Med 2010; 76: 2026 -2035Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. has been used as an infusion to treat malaria throughout the southern parts of Africa, in much the same way as the antimalar-ial plant Artemisia annua in China. Liu et al. had used metabolo- mics to investigate the ethnopharmacological use of NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis [70]. Their findings show that there is no in vitro activity, and a list of the identified metabolites causing the metabolic differences ispresented. Artemisinin has been proven to be an effective anti-malarial compound, especially for chloroquine-resistant and ce-rebral malaria. In order to get new clues about artemisinin bio-synthesis, metabolic profiling by GC and GC MS was applied to compare the secondary metabolites of two Artemisia annua L. genotypes. It could be shown that there were clear differencesin terpenoids and artemisinin metabolism between differentgrowth stages and genotypes [71].Metabolite profiling of five medicinal Panax P. ginseng (Korean ginseng), was per- formed using UPLC MS and a multivariate statistical analysis technique. PCA of the analytical data showed that the five Panax herbs could be separated into five different groups of phyto-chemicals. The chemical markers such such variations, were identifiedthrough the loadings plot of PCA, tentatively by the accurate massof TOF/MS, and partially by a reference standard [72]. Six differ-ent types of ginseng roots from China and Korea could be easilydifferentiated by NMR-based metabolomics [73]. Pharmacody-namic effects of on metabonomesof healthy and liver-tumor-bearing rats have been investigated.Seventeen biomarker candidates including three apolar metabo-lites were detected for global analysis of highly complex biosam-ples [74]. This approach may not only increase the number of dis-covered biomarkers but consequently improve the comprehen-sive information on metabolic changes.Liang et al. used LC/MS to analyze 16 saponins simultaneously,and the developed methodology could effectively break the ap-plication bottleneck on the quantitative analysis of multi-compo-nent LC/MS data and be applied widely in related fields for multi-component analysis, especially in CHM research [75]. Concur-rently, a number of metabolites involved in glucose metabolism,citric acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism were affected imme-diately after the intake of green tea, and the proposed approachprovided a more comprehensive picture of the metabolic changesafter intake of green tea in human urine [76]. Interestingly, greenand black tea intake had a different impact on endogenous me-tabolites in urine and plasma. Green tea intake caused a strongerincrease in urinary excretion of several citric acid cycle inter-mediates, which suggests an effect of green tea flavanols on hu-man oxidative energy metabolism and/or biosynthetic pathways[77]. The metabolic strategy has shown its potential in optimiza-tion of harvest time and chemical markers screening of tangerinepeels, herbal materials of two coupled traditional Reticulatae and Pericarpium Citri Reticu-latae Viride, perspective in the analysis of\"coupled TCMs \"[78]. Major metabolite of both unusualmetabolite found was the monoacylglyceride of arecaidine. Itwas shown which role is played by these uncommon metabolitesin the toxicology of arecoline and arecaidine [79]. Evocarpine,from the herb Evodia rutaecarpa , is not transported by p-gp and showed only slight toxicity at the highest test concen-tration of 30 \u00b5M [80]. Evodiae rutaecarpa has changed the endog- enous metabolites of rats and can provide the base for the furtherresearch on the interpretation of drug property [81]. Molecularcompositions of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.) extracts and their dependence on extraction solvents, seasons, and dryingprocesses were systematically characterized using NMR spec-troscopy and multivariate data analysis. Results showed that therosemary metabonome was dominated by 33 metabolites includ-ing sugars, amino acids, organic acids, polyphenolic acids, and di-terpenes, among which quinate, cis-4-glucosyloxycinnamic acid,and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylmethanol were found in rosemaryfor the first time [82]. It can be concluded that the metabolomicsare a potentially powerful tool to explore the therapeutic basis ofTCM herbs. Metabolomics in the study of mineral medicine An important traditional Chinese mineral medicine, Cinnabar , has been widely used as a Chinese patent medicine ingredientfor sedative therapy, induced disturbance in energy metabolism,amino acid metabolism and gut microflora environment, as wellas slight injury in the liver and kidney, which might indirectlyresult from cinnabar induced oxidative stress [83]. The time-dependent biochemical variations induced by realgar wereachieved using pattern recognition methods. They illustrated thehigh reliability of the NMR-based metabolomic approach for thestudy of biochemical effects induced by mineral medicine [84]. Metabolomics in acupuncture Chinese acupuncture, handed down from the ancient times, stillsurvives in clinical practice nowadays. At present, acupuncturehas attracted extensive attention in the domestic and overseascircles in the TCM field. Numerous experimental studies havedemonstrated that acupuncture can correct various metabolicdisorders such as hyperglycemia, overweight, hyperphagia, hy-perlipidemia, inflammation, altered activity of the sympatheticnervous system, and insulin signal defect, all of which contributeto the development of insulin resistance [85]. In addition, acu-puncture has the potential to improve insulin sensitivity. Thesestudies have revealed the mechanisms responsible for the benefi-cial effects of acupuncture, though further investigations are war-ranted. Functional dyspepsia acupuncture-treated patientsshowed significantly changed levels of leucine/isoleucine, lactate,and glucose, and a slightly changed lipids level towards those ofthe healthy controls, demonstrating the therapeutic effects of acu-puncture on the relief of functional dyspepsia symptoms; this is aNMR-based metabolomic approach in the study of biological ef-fects of acupuncture [86]. Metabolomics in Chinese medicine syndromes Metabolomics, the analysis of the metabolite profile in body flu-ids or tissues, is being applied to the analysis of a number of dif-ferent diseases as well as being used in following responses totherapy. There is good reason to think that metabolomics willfind particular utility in the investigation of disease, which mayhave tissue specific and systemic components. Metabolomicanalysis can inform us about ocular or other body fluids and cantherefore provide new information on pathways and processesinvolved in these responses.Metabolomics has been used in several animal models of humandisease. A recent study was conducted by Qiu et al. to investigate2032 Zhang A et al.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the metabolic responses to Herba Cistanches intervention in a rat model of hydrocortisone-induced \"kidney-deficiency syn- drome \". It revealed that Herba stasis obstruction pattern) \"and \"Qiyinliangxuzheng (qi and yin deficiency pattern) \"for myocardial ischemia rat models were constructed by Yan et al. Endogenous metabolites in rat wereindicated as the potential biomarkers, suggesting that the twoabove-mentioned patterns are involved in dysfunction, oxidativestress, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism [88].Chen et al. described the metabolomic study of a biochemicalmodification in vivo induced by a high dose of hydrocortisone, which led to a unique pathologic condition similar to the \"kidney deficiency syndrome \", an early stage of obesity and diabetes in TCM [89]. In the study, 24-h urine was collected pre-dose and atdays 1, 3, 7, and 10 post-dose after rats were injected with hydro-cortisone at 1.5 mg/100 g. The acquired data were transferred in-to Matlab to be processed using PCA. Results indicated clear andconsistent biochemical changes following hydrocortisone inter-vention. It suggested that metabolomic approach could be usedas a potentially powerful tool to investigate the biochemicalchanges of certain physiopathologic conditions such as metabolicsyndrome, as an early diagnostic means.Luo et al. determined the changes of the plasma metabolic phe-notype in rats with chronic restraint stress (rats with syndromeof liver qi stagnation and spleen deficiency) [90]. Metabolomicanalysis of rat plasma revealed different metabolic spectra be-tween stress and control groups, which were consistent with al-terations of in vivo metabolisms in rats under stress stimuli. Compared with the control group, rats with repeated stress dis-played significant changes in spectral peak shapes of acetate, lac-tate, tyrosine, and low-density lipoprotein. These altered metab-olites can be used as biomarkers of syndrome of liver qi stagna-tion and spleen deficiency. Therefore, metabolomics is an ap-proach with good development prospects for studies of TCM syn-dromes. Conclusion and Future Perspective ! In this review, we delineate and discuss metabolomic approachesto resolve special TCM issues. Metabolomics, a new but rapidlygrowing field, has the potential to impact our understanding ofTCM theory and molecular mechanisms of disease. Facing thecomplicated life phenomemon, metabolomics will be a powerfulmeans to the research of a complex system theory and modern-ization of TCM. So that application of metabolomics for TCM willfacilitate the understanding of the intrinsic quality of TCM syn-dromes and the evaluation of the therapeutic effects of its formu-lae, Chinese herbal and mineral medicine, as well as acupuncture,and explore the therapeutic basis and the possible action mecha-nisms of TCM. Combined metabolomics and TCM methodologieswill also provide a new pathway and methodology for TCM andits modernization. Overall, with the further development of me-tabolomic analytical techniques, especially multi-analysis tech-niques, we eagerly expect that metabolomics will greatly pro-mote TCM research and establish international standards, being beneficial to its modernization.
