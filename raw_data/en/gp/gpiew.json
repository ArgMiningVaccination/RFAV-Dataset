As of late, with the passage of SB277 in California, the mainstream media has been trying to convince everyone that the vaccinated child is some how a healthier individual and lives a more \"disease\" free life versus their unvaccinated counterpoint. Is this the truth? A 20-year-old study from the 1990's has recently surfaced that compares [unvaccinated children](http://newlifechiropracticrocklin.vaultwebsites.com/freedom-is-freedom-of-choice-in-health-care/) to vaccinated children. The study concludes that those who were vaccinated were more likely to suffer from the following illnesses: asthma, eczema, ear infections, hyperactivity and many other chronic conditions. There was a 10-fold increase in cases of tonsillitis in the children who were vaccinated and a 100% absence of tonsillitis in those unvaccinated. Immunization Awareness Society Vaccination Study In 1992, the Immunization Awareness Society (IAS) conducted a survey to examine the health of New Zealand's children. Unsurprisingly, the results from their study indicated that unvaccinated children were far healthier than vaccinated children. Questionnaires were given out to IAS members, their friends and their associates asking various health questions. A total of 245 families returned their questionnaires, giving the researchers a total of 495 children surveyed. Of these children, 226 were vaccinated and 269 were unvaccinated. During the study, another interesting fact emerged. Researchers discovered that 92 percent of the children requiring a tonsillectomy operation had received the measles vaccination, indicating that the vaccination for measles may have made some of the children more susceptible to tonsillitis. The study also revealed that 81 of the families had both vaccinated and unvaccinated children. Many of these families had vaccinated their older children but had grown more reluctant to vaccinate their younger children, due to their growing concerns regarding vaccine safety. Researchers concluded that: While this was a very limited study, particularly in terms of the numbers of unvaccinated children that were involved and the range of chronic conditions investigated, it provides solid scientific evidence in support of considerable anecdotal evidence that unvaccinated children are healthier that their vaccinated peers. German Vaccination Studies Shows Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier In September 2011, German researchers carrying out a longitudinal study surveyed a total of 8000 unvaccinated children from the ages of 0 -19. As with the New Zealand study, researchers collected their data by conducting a survey using questionnaires. Results showed that vaccinated children were up to five times more likely to suffer from a variety of diseases and disorders than unvaccinated children. Their results were compared to another German study (KiGGS), which examined a larger sample group consisting of 17,461 participants between the ages of 0 -17. Dr. Andreas Bachair, a German classical homeopathic practitioner, responsible for collecting the results from the survey from the website [vaccineinjury.info](http://vaccineinjury.info) stated that: Asthma, hay fever and neurodermatitis are seen very frequently today. A recent German study with 17461 children between 0-17 years of age (KIGGS) showed that 4.7% of these children suffer from asthma, 10.7% of these children from hay fever and 13.2% from neurodermatitis. These numbers differ in western countries, i.e. the prevalence of asthma among children in the US is 6% whereas it is 14-16% in Australia (Australia's Health 2004, AIHW). The prevalence of asthma among unvaccinated children in our study is around 2.5%, hay fever, 3%, and neurodermatitis, 7%. According to the KIGGS study more than 40% of children between the ages of 3 and 17 years were sensitized against at least one allergen tested (20 common allergens were tested), and 22.9% had an allergic disease. Although we did not perform a blood test, around 10% stated that their children had an allergy. Why Won't The U.S. Conduct Vaccination Studies? No study of health outcomes of vaccinated people versus unvaccinated has ever been conducted in the U.S. by CDC or any other agency in the 50 years or more of an accelerating schedule of vaccinations (now over 60 doses of 14 vaccines given before kindergarten, 26 doses in the first year). Long-term vaccine-induced diseases and disorders are not recognized by parents or doctors when these conditions develop perhaps a few months to five or more years later and would never be realized to come from multiple vaccinations.

While surveys of this kind are often dismissed as being purely epidemiological and passed off as little more than stamp collecting, we believe that studies of this nature should not be dismissed out of hand. These studies show without doubt that unvaccinated children are healthier than their vaccinated peers and, for this reason; these studies should be given careful consideration by all parents and professionals studying vaccination safety.
