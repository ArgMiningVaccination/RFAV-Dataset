California issued its first ND licenses in January 2005. Is naturopathic a new form of treatment? No. Naturopathic care has been used for decades in the United States and abroad. Some states have licensed naturopathic doctors since the early 1900s. Will my health insurance pay for licensed naturopathic care? Maybe. More and more insurance companies are covering naturopathic care. Check with your health insurance provider to be sure. In some cases, you may have to pay for naturopathic services, then submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement. Can I be treated by a naturopathic doctor and by a medical doctor? Yes, but you should inform both doctors for appropriate integrated care. What conditions can a naturopathic doctor treat? Naturopathic doctors are primary care providers. They are trained and licensed to diagnose and treat conditions and diseases. They can also provide adjunctive treatment for cancer in collaboration with your medical doctor. Where can I get more information on treatment by naturopathic doctors? See [A Consumer's Guide to Naturopathic Medicine](/formspubs/brochure_guide.pdf), available on this Web site. You may contact the Board for one free copy, or may purchase multiple copies by contacting the Board at [naturopathic@dca.ca.gov](mailto:naturopathic@dca.ca.gov). In other states, I have visited a naturopathic physician, in California I can't find one. Are naturopathic doctors and naturopathic physicians the same thing? Yes. Unfortunately, in California, NDs may not use the physician title, but a ND is the same as a naturopathic physician in other naturopathic medicine regulating states. Can NDs recommend Cannabis? No, unfortunately, NDs licensed in California may not recommend Cannabis at this time. Are NDs allowed to prescribe/recommend/furnish the use of CBD? Yes, NDs in California may utilize hemp-derived CBD (with no trace amounts of THC) within their practice and may furnish and provide it to their patients. Hemp-derived CBD has been removed from the Schedule I list. "}
