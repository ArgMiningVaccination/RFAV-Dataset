Known as the integumentary system, the skin is the largest organ of the body, stretching two square meters and weighing over 10 pounds! Waterproof yet permeable, protective yet sensitive, our skin may best be described as the outer expression of our inner health. So when our inner health is out of balance, it can manifest on the skin through all sorts of reactions, from outbreaks and rashes to everything in between. But skin health means so much more than outer beauty; a good skincare regime should help you glow from the inside out. With skin, as with all systems of the body in herbalism, you need to think holistically, by considering other areas of the body. Introducing skin-supporting herbal teas into your daily wellness routines can set you on the right path. \"Our skin is a mirror of our health and plays many important roles in the body. It protects us against dirt, infection, extremes of temperature and climate, sunlight, pollution and physical injury.\" -Anne McIntyre Glow from the Inside Out Maintaining healthy skin should start with a healthy diet of whole, organic foods. But sometimes, eating well isn't enough, and we need to dive deeper to get to the bottom of our imbalances. If you've tried topical creams and ointments that don't work, we recommend focusing on what's going inside your body first. Some people even like to try an elimination diet first to help uncover any food sensitivities. If your food intake seems to be working for you, an easy way to start a skincare regimen is by supporting your digestive, lymphatic, and immune systems with [spring tonic herbs](/articles/plants/the-basics-herbal-tonics/). So many of your bodily functions involve those areas of the body\u2014hormones, digestion, and immunity\u2014so keeping your digestive system healthy is often the best first line of defense. After digestion, we recommend supporting your lymphatic system and your nervous system to keep your stress levels and immunity balanced.* [Author](https://www.amazon.com/David-Hoffmann/e/B0034PZQTS?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_7&qid=1610392808&sr=8-7%22%20t%20%22_blank26sr%3D8-7%22+%5Ct+%22_blank%22&aqs=chrome..69i57.1335j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and Traditional Medicinals Medical Herbalist [David Hoffmann](/articles/community/plant-people-medical-herbalist-david-hoffman/) draws an important link between skin health and the nervous system.

It's always best to work with your healthcare practitioner to find out which herbs and what protocol is best for you and your body. But once you find your routine and remove any triggers that may be aggravating it, you'll find that your body will start helping your skin find balance again.
