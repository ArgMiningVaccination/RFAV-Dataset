On this page you will find information about the devotional and meditation programs offered by First Parish Church, and other resources about mindfulness, prayer, and other spiritual practices to sustain your spirit. It turns out that the simple practice of focusing on the present moment and practicing gratitude is a doorway to finding compassion, connection, and even transformation. ~ ~ ~ God is not a Christian, God is not a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Hindu, or a Buddhist. All of those are human systems which human beings have created to try to help us walk into the mystery of God. I honor my tradition, I walk through my tradition, but I don't think my tradition defines God, I think it only points me to God. ~ John Shelby Spong Weekly Morning Meditation Wednesdays at 8:30 AM . There is a NEW LINK as of August 2023 The weekly sessions typically begin with a short lesson or reflection on mindfulness and finding meaning followed by a guided meditation and a time of silence. The guidance and instruction is suitable for beginners as well as those with an advanced meditation practice. Everyone is welcome to stay afterward for 5-10 minutes of informal discussion. We begin by 8:30 am and always finish by 9:15 am. No prior experience is required, and all are welcome to join us. We typically have anywhere from 9 to 25 people participating each week. We invite you take a little time out of your week for contemplation and stillness... slowing down helps keep us steady when the world speeds up! Muddy water set still. Zoom Meeting ID: [8632 5517 532 ](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86325517532)(New link starting in August 2023) Yoga Flow with Rev. Sarah First & Third Friday at 10:00 AM First Parish holds hatha/vinyasa yoga flow class on the first and third Friday of the month, taught by Rev. Sarah Napoline, our Assistant Minister. Sarah has been practicing yoga for over five years and completed a Yoga Alliance certified teacher training program. The classes are an all-levels flow; it keeps up a moderate pace but includes modifications for beginners or options for more advanced practice. Vinyasa yoga flow means that we move through the postures at a mindful pace, linking our breath with movement. The classes are about an hour long and include stretching, strengthening, balance, and relaxation/meditation. You'll leave feeling refreshed and renewed. \"Let every moment be a prayer. With every sip of tea, let your lips move in thanksgiving. Be fully present to every stroke of the hairbrush, every cup of milk you pour for the children. Be present, without judgment or regret, without plans or expectations, or even dreams, and every moment becomes a prayer.\" \u2014 Elena Westbrook, Unitarian Universalist lay leader Answers to our Frequently Asked Questions can be found on the Yoga Flow page on our website.

I was walking by her house one day feeling lonely, unloved and mad, kicking anything I could find. Laughing, she said to me, \"Little girl, don't you go letting life harden your heart.\" We can let the circumstances of our lives harden us so that we become increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us and make us kinder and more open to what scares us. We always have this choice. ~ Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n (formerly Deirdre Brown) Unitarian Parish](https://firstparishweston.org/meditation/uu-wellspring/)in early 2023.
