I only found it a week ago but since then I've been there twice and bought two different types of tea and two different essential oils. All four of the items I bought were of of the highest quality. I will be a life long customer I think. \u2014 Mike Vescovo Love, love, the Sinus mixture, it has peppermint, eucalyptus, lemon, lavender oils, clears my sinuses up! Also Love the Pregnancy Tea, and Mary's Tea. \u2014 Chrissy Ramsey With extra parking in the back, I felt stress free walking into the front door. The smell of herbs and oils surrounded my senses with a strong feel of relaxation. The staff answered all my questions and even printed of directions on how to steep the teas. Love this place. \u2014 Samantha Cross Never Miss An Update Attracting new email subscriptions is a great use for a popup, but you can also use it for other purposes, like an 'agree-to-terms' entry point, or to link directly to pages and products in your shop.
