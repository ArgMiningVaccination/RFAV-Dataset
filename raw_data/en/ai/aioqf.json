Perceived differences between and limitations of traditional \"allopathic\" medicine and IHW \"nontraditional\" medicine will be identified. Patients' motivations and patterns of use of IHW approaches will be explored. Components of the five major areas within IHW as identified by the National Institutes of Health will be introduced. These include alternative medical systems, body-based systems (massage, chiropractic, rolfing), mind-body medicine, biological approaches (herbal medicine, nutritional approaches, pharmacological therapies, Ayurveda), and bioelectromagnetics (energy healing). The state of basic scientific knowledge and data from controlled trials relating to the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of integrative therapies are presented. In the second half of the course, an overview of the scientific evidence for the integrative biological and body-based approaches will be provided. Theories for how these approaches function to affect health are examined, such as psychoneuroimmunology, the role of inflammation, and the gut microbiome. Key practice, legal, and ethical issues facing CAM researchers and practitioners are reviewed.

Students will be introduced to health behavior change theories and models, as well as interventions from integrative health and wellness. Also explored are personal, social, lifestyle, and medical resources to encourage comprehensive wellness. Students will work to develop strategies appropriate to their patient/client population through research, class discussions, mentored coaching activities, and independent assignments. Students will also complete a behavioral change project with a partner, allowing them to experience the roles of both a health and wellness coach and a client. [MHS 619: Clinical Application of Integrative Health and Wellness (3 Credits) ] Offered: 2nd 8-week session Spring Semester (Spring B) Prerequisite MHS: 612 This course will provide students an interprofessional overview of the clinical application of integrative health and wellness approaches. Students will learn the skills necessary for developing an effective therapeutic practitioner-patient relationship and strategies for communicating and educating patients about integrative health and wellness approaches, potential benefits, and possible risks. The factors affecting the utilization, interpretation, and patient understanding of these therapies will be examined. Clinical decision-making and the influence of research on recommendations and evaluation will be examined. Students will learn how the integrative assessment differs from the conventional assessment process and how to develop an integrative treatment plan. Numerous case studies demonstrating the application of integrative approaches for the treatment and prevention of common and chronic diseases will be analyzed. Finally, the challenges in developing research to adequately examine the integrative approach as it is applied in clinical practice will be discussed. Here's what our students are saying: \"I always love the discussions in these courses. I learn from all the students and their various backgrounds and appreciate when some express views that I never would have considered.\" \"At first, I was a little unsure about this course because health coaching is not something I had on my radar or really had much of an interest in doing. However, as the course progressed, I realized how applicable the topic is to my profession and how the skills would improve my interactions and outcomes with patients. The peer coaching sessions were a highlight in this course because they allowed moments to learn and get feedback while practicing the skills. I also loved that those taking the course had varied backgrounds and could add wisdom and insight to the discussion each week. I also loved that the last module included resources on coaching in marginalized, underserved communities.\" \"I loved the abundance of resources. I also really loved the [self-reflection] journals because they gave us many opportunities to try out the modalities we were learning about. I have even integrated some of them into my daily life. Even though the course was online, the discussions fostered a very rich learning environment.\" \"The personal wellness project actually helped me find a way to manage my personal health concern. I aim to regularly include this practice in my life from now on.\" \"I love the life application aspect of every topic in this course. Learning by experience is a life changing way to develop knowledge. This will facilitate a much deeper connection with clients "}
