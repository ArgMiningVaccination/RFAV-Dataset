App. 4a Docket No. 18 -859 Before : JACOBS, CALABRESI, Circuit Judges. , RAKOFF, District Judge. 2 GUIDO CALABRESI, Circuit Judge : This is the latest in a series of cases that stretch back decades and which have long sought to strike down the federal government 's classification of mari - juana as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq . Enforce ment Admin. , 739 F. App'x 655 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (mem.) ; Ams. for Safe Access v. Drug Enforce ment Admin. , 706 F.3d 438 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ; Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Dru g Enforce- ment Admin. , 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (mem.). The current case is, however, unusual in one significant respect : among the Plain tiffs are individ- uals who plausibly allege that the current scheduling of marijuana poses a serious, life -or-death threat to their health. We agree with the District Court that Plain tiffs should attempt to exhaust their admin istra- tive remedies before seeking relief from us, but we are troubled by the Drug Enforce ment Admin istration (DEA)'s history of dil atory proceedings. Accord ingly, while we concur with the District Court's ruling, we do not dismiss the case, but rather hold it in abeyance and retain juris diction in this panel to take what ever action might become appro priate if the DEA does not act with adequate dispatch. 2 Judge Jed S. Rakoff, of the United States Dis trict Court for the Southern Dis trict of New York, sitting by desig nation. App. 5a STANDARD OF REVIEW The trial court granted Defend ants' motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6) to dismiss Plain tiffs' case. We therefore review its decision de novo , accepting as true all of the complaint 's well - pleaded facts. See d'Amico Dry Ltd. v. Primera Mari time (Hellas) Ltd. , 886 F.3d 216, 222 (2d Cir. 2018) ; Harris v. Mills , 572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 2009). BACKGROUND A. Parties As this case reaches us at the motion to dismiss stage, we must treat the well -pleaded facts alleged in Plain tiffs' complaint as true. Accord ing to their plead - ings, Plain tiffs are several individuals and a member - ship organ ization with an interest in the regulation of marijuana. They assert that the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance under the CSA harms them in one or more ways. Marvin Washington is an African -Amer ican busi- nessman working in the medical marijuana space. He would like to expand his business into whole -plant cannabis products and take advantage of the federal Minority Business Enter prise Program, but, he alleges, he is impeded from so doing by the drug's scheduling. Alexis Bortell and Jagger Cotte are children with dreadful medical problems. Bortell suffers from chronic and intractable seizures ; Cotte from Leigh's disease. They allege that they exhausted traditional treat ment options before finding success medicating with cannabi s. They claim that marijuana has saved their lives. Because of its Schedule I classification, however, they cannot bring their life -saving medicine App. 6a with them when they travel onto federal lands or into states where marijuana is illegal. For Bortell, the se travel limitations also mean that she cannot take full advantage of the veteran's benefits to which she is entitled through her father. In addition, both Bortell and Cotte live in constant fear that their parents might be subject to arrest and prosecution for their involve ment in their children's medical treat ment . Jose Belen is a veteran of the war in Iraq and suffers from post -traumatic stress disorder. After his honorable discharge , he became suicidal and was adjudged 70% disabled. He alleges that he pursued conventional therapies unsuccessfully. In despair, he turned to medical marijuana. This, he claims, has allowed him to manage his symptoms. He further asserts, like Bortell, that marijuana's Schedule I classification restricts his ability to travel and to take full advantage of his veteran's benefits. The Cannabis Cultural Asso ciation, Inc. (CCA) is a not -for-profit organ ization dedicated to assisting people of color develop a presence in the cannabis industry. CCA is particularly focused on th e way past convictions for possession, cultivation, distribution, and use of marijuana have disproportionately affected people of color and prevented minorities from partici - pating in the new state -legal marijuana industry. Defend ants are the United States, the Attor ney General, the Depart ment of Justice, the Acting Adminis trator of the DEA, and the DEA itself. They are responsible for imple ment ing the CSA and, more particularly, for updating the classification of controlled substances. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a) ; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100(b). App. 7a B. Proceeding s below Plain tiffs initiated the instant suit in the Southern District of New York in July 2017 and filed the amended complaint now at issue on September 6, 2017. Plain tiffs raised numerous argu ment s for re - or deschedule marijuana, including, as relevant to this appeal, (a) that the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug exceeded Congress 's powers under the Commerce Clause and was without a rational basis, ( b) that the classification was arbitrary and capricious, (c) that marijuana's inclusion in the CSA was racially animated and is an act of view point dis- crim ination, and (d) that the law, as applied to Plain - tiffs, violates variously their (or, in CCA 's case, its members') First, Fifth, and Ninth Amend ment rights, including, inter alia , substantive due process and the fundamental right to travel. The crux of Plain tiffs' case is that new facts related to the acceptance of medical marijuana treat - ment regimens and the federal government 's own involve ment in medical marijuana research require a reexam ination of marijuana's scheduling under the CSA. The complaint seeks declaratory relief, as well as an injunction restraining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA with respect to cannabis. In reply, Defend ants moved to dismiss. After argu ment , the District Cour t granted the government 's motion and dismissed Plain tiffs' suit. It further held that amending the complaint would be futile. As a threshold matter, the Court deter mine d that Plain tiffs had failed to exhaust their admin istra- tive remedies and that they did not qualify for an exception to the exhaustion rule. On the merits, the Court did not find Plain tiffs' argu ment s persuasive App. 8a and deemed their claims to be either foreclosed by precedent or without legal author ity. The Cour t addi- tionally held that CCA failed to estab lish that it had stand ing to pursue its claim, since the relief it sought would not redress the injury its members had allegedly suffered. The District Court entered judg- ment on February 26, 2018, and this appeal timely followed. DISCUSSION We resolve this case without reaching most of Plain tiffs' disparate argu ment s. As the District Court correctly observed, Plain tiffs challenge the current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance under the CSA but did not first bring this challenge to the agency that has the author ity to reschedule mari - juana , the DEA. 3 Although the CSA does not expressly mandate the exhaustion of admin istrative remedies, our precedents indicate that it is generally to be re- quire d as a prudential rule of judicial admin istration. We agree with the District Court that exhaustion was 3 The CSA places in the Attor ney General the power to schedule, reschedule, or deschedule drugs. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a). The Attor ney General has promulgated rules delegating this power to the head of the DEA. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100(b). The CSA further requires that, before scheduling, rescheduling, or descheduling a drug, the Attor ney General \"shall . . . request from the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] a scientific and med ical evaluation [of the drug] , and [the Secretary's] re commend ations, as to whether such drug or other substance should be so con trolled or removed,\" which \"shall be binding on the Attor ney General as to such scientific and med ical matters.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(b). The process fo r reviewing a drug's scheduling can be initiated by the Attor ney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or \"on the petition of any interested party.\" Id. \u00a7 811(a). App. 9a appro priate here. But in light of the allegedly pre- carious situation of several of the Plain tiffs, which at this stage of the proceedings we must accept as true, and their argu ment that the admin istrative process may not move quickly enough to afford them ade quate relief, we retain juris diction of the case in this panel, for the sole purpose of taking what ever action might become appro priate should the DEA not act with adequate dispatch. We wish to make clear, however, that, in doing so, we express no view what ever on the merits of Plain tiffs' case \u2014that is, on whether marijuana should be listed or not. A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Is Appro- priate Here The admin istrative state is a topic of much debate these days. See Gillian E. Metzger, The Supreme Court, 2016 Term \u2014Foreword : 1930s Redux : The Admin is- trative State Under Siege , 131 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (2017). Distinguished jurists and scholars have been critical of its expansion. See, e.g. , Gutierrez -Brizuela v. Lynch , Cir. (Gorsuch, J., ; Philip Hamburger, Is Admin istrative Law Un lawful? (2014). Others u nder stand it as a central part of our modern republic. See generally Stephen Skowronek, Building a New Amer ican State: The Expansion of National Admin istrative Capacities, 1877-1920 (1982) ; see also Jerry L. Mashaw, Creating the Admin istrative Constitution: The Lost One Hundred Years of Amer ican Admin istrative Law (2012) (tracing the roots of the admin istrative state back to the Founding). Regardless of one's point of view, it remains at the moment a key part of our legal regime. The doctrines that regulate the relationship between courts and admin istrative agencies are thus App. 10a of particular importance. The y attempt to reconcile the advantages of expertise, flexibility, and efficiency with the safeguards of government under law. See Daniel R. Ernst, Tocqueville's Nightmare : The Admin is- trative State Emerges in America, 1900 -1940 (2014). Exhaustion of admin istrative remedies is one such doctrine. It holds that federal courts should refrain from adjudicating a controversy if the party bringing suit might obtain adequate relief through a proceed - ing before an admin istrative agency. See Woodford v. Ngo , 548 U.S. 81, 88 -89 (2006) (\"[N]o one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed admin istrative remedy has been exhausted.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). T he duty to exhaust admin istrative remedies can spring from legislation or from judicial decision. \"Where Congress specifically mandates [it], exhaustion is require d.\" McCarthy v. Madigan , 503 U.S. 140, 144 (1992), super seded by statute on other grounds as recog nized in Porter v. Nussle , 534 U.S. 516 (2002). \"But [even] where Congress has not clearly require d exhaustion,\" a court may still impose it as an act of \"sound judicial discretion.\" Id. Before requiring exhaustion as a \"rule of judicial admin istration,\" Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. , 303 U.S. 41, 50 (1938), a court should, however, look to \" legis lative purpose, which is of para mount importance.\" Patsy v. Bd. of Regents of State of Fla. , 457 U.S. 496, 501 (1982). Simply put, \"a court should not defer the exercise of juris diction under a federal statute unless it is consistent with [ congressional] intent.\" Id. at 501 -02; see also id. at 502 n.4 (\"Even where the statutory require ment of exhaustion is not explicit, courts are guided by congressional intent in App. 11a determining whether appli cation of the doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme.\"). Although the CSA do es not mandate exhaustion of admin istrative remedies, we agree with the court below that exhaustion here is consistent with congres- sional intent and is therefore appro priate. This judg- ment flows from our analysis of the text and structure of the Act. The text of the CSA shows that Congress sought to favor admin istrative decision-making. In several places, the words of the statute either presume or create an admin istrative process to review the classi - fication of drugs under the Act's schedules. Thus, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a) instructs the Attor ney General to schedule, reschedule, or deschedule drugs under the Act by rules \"made on the record after oppor tunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedure s prescribed\" by the Admin is- trative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq . Similarly, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(b) details the procedure s the Attor ney General should follow when scheduling, rescheduling, or descheduling drugs, in cluding a duty to defer to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on certain medical and scientific matters. And \u00a7 811(c) lists several factors the Attor ney General must consider before initiating classification. See generally Ams. for Safe Access , 706 F.3d at 439 -41. These provisions, among others, estab lish that Congress intended to imple ment scheduling decisions under the CSA through an admin istrative process. Re- quiring would -be plain tiffs to exhaust that process before turning to the courts is consonant with that intent. Were plain tiffs able to go directly to federal App. 12a court to pursue reclassification, the language Congress devised to erect an admin istrative review process would be rendered a nullity. It follows that construing the Act to allow such behavior as a matter of course would violate a basic canon of statutory interpretation : that, if possible, every provision of a statute must be given effect. See, e.g. , Williams v. Taylor , 529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000). The structure of the Act reinforce s the language used and hence our conclusion that Congress wanted aggrieved parties to p ursue reclassification through agencies, and not, in the first instance, through the federal courts. The CSA relies on an admin istrative process to operate effectively. When Congress enacted the CSA, it put, by legis lative fiat, certain drugs directly into schedules. See Controlled Substances Act, Pub. L. No. 91 -513, \u00a7 202, 84 Stat. 1236, 1247 -52 (1970) (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812) ; see also Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U.S. 1, 14 (2005). But the statute contem - plated that these initial lists would be regularly revised and updated by the Attor ney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and that this would be done accord ing to a specific procedure and set of standard s. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 811(a) -(c). The Act thus incorporates an admin is- trative process into its structure. Indeed, its logic and design depend on admin istration and agency actions to realize its aims. Not to require exhaustion in the ordinary case would therefore undermine the text and structure of the CSA. In addition, requiring exhaustion is eminently sensible here. The Supreme Court has told us that exhaustion furthers two important goals. First, it \"pro- tect[s] admin istrative agency author ity.\" McCarthy , 503 App. 13a U.S. ' delega- tion . . . to coordinate branches exhaustion recognizes \"that agencies . . . have primary responsibility for the programs that Congress has charged them to administer.\" Id. Second, exhaustion \"promotes judicial efficiency\" by giving an admin istra- tive agency a chance to resolve a dispute, thus either rendering contro versies moot or \"produc[ing] a useful record for subsequent judicial consideration.\" Id. Both purposes are advanced by requiring exhaus - tion in the instant case. The Supreme Court has recog - nized that protecting agency author ity is a particular- ly compelling aim where \"the agency proceedings in ques tion allow the agency to apply its special expertise.\" Id. (citing McKart v. Unite d States , 395 U.S. 185, 194 (1969)). That is the situation in the case before us now. At its root, the ques tion raised by Plain tiffs' suit is whether devel opment s in medical research and government practice should lead to the reclassification of marijuana. This is precisely the kind of ques tion that calls for the appli cation of special know ledge . Exhaustion here \" protect[s] admin istrative agency author ity\" by leaving this decision in the first instance to the specialists at the DEA and the Depart - ment of Health and Human Services. Id. Admin istrative exhaustion will also promote judi- cial efficiency in the ways identified by the Supreme Court. It is conceivable that, in response to a petition from Plain tiffs along the lines advanced before us now, the DEA would reschedule marijuana, rendering the current case moot. And if the DEA did not, the admin istrative process would generate a comprehen- sive record that would aid in eventual judicial review. The Supreme Court has observed that the creation of App. 14a such a record can be \"especially\" beneficial \"in a complex or technical factual context, \" id., which is the context involved in the case at bar. Accord Shenandoah v. U.S. Dep't of Interior , 159 F.3d 708, 713 (2d Cir. 1998) ; City of New York v. Heckler , 742 F.2d 729, 737 (2d Cir. 1984). Moreover, we think that the kinds of argu ment s Plain tiffs advance make this case well suited to admin istrative evaluation and in appro priate for federal court determination in the first instance. Plain tiffs do not contend that a decisive event or singular discovery has rendered the previous classification of marijuana under the CSA indefensible. Rather, Plain tiffs claim that a shift over time in our under stand ing of the uses and dangers of marijuana warrants a change in marijuana's classification. This argu ment raises a complex policy ques tion: whether the extant regulatory regime continues to advance the CSA's goals in light of the current state of our know ledge about the drug. It is possible that the current law, though rational once, is now heading toward s irrationality ; it may even conceivably be that it has gotten there already. Courts are not especially good at dealing with situations of this sort by them selves . In such circumstance s, dialogue between courts and other law-defining institutions, li ke agencies, often works best. See United States v. Then , 56 F.3d 464, 468 -69 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring). A sensible response to our evolving under stand ing about the effects of marijuana might require creating new policies just as much as changing old ones. This kind of constructive government al work, mixing adjudi - cation and program -design, creating policy through the balancing of competing legitimate interests, is not App. 15a generally best accomplish ed by federal courts on their own ; it is, however, the stock -in-trade of admin istra- tion. See, e.g. , James M. Landis, The Admin istrative Process (1938). Assuming, of course, that one can get the admin istrative agency to act. For the foregoing reasons, requiring exhaustion is appro priate in the instant case. Although not mandated by Congress , it is consistent with congres- sional intent, as manifested in the CSA's text and structure. And it advances the goals that the Supreme Court has announced the doctrine serves. The District Court's decision to require exhaustion here was therefore correct. B. None of the Recognized Exceptions to the Doctrine Govern This Case at This Time Even where exhaustion is seemingly mandated by statute or decisional law, the require ment is not absolute. The Supreme Court itself has recog nized exceptions to the exhaustion require ment under \"three broad sets of circumstance s.\" McCarthy , 503 U.S. at 146. First, exhaustion may be un neces sary where it would be futile, either because agency decision-makers are biased or because the agency has already deter - mine d the issue. Id. at 148. It does not appear, how- ever, that this futility exception currently applies here. Plain tiffs cite to various public state ment s by former Attor ney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III and former Acting Administrator of the DEA Charles Philip Rosenberg to suggest that the admi n- istrative process would be biased against them. But Plain tiffs' evidence , even if given the interpretation they suggest, does not qualify them for the exception, since App. 16a the public state ment s relied on do not implicate the relevant decision-maker. Neither Sessions nor Rosenberg remains part of the review process. Nor, indeed, would they have been the relevant decision- makers at the time Plain tiffs initiated their suit. On the medical and scientific claims central to Plain tiffs' argu ment , it is the opinion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that matters, not the judgment of the Attor ney General or the head of the DEA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(b) (stating that \"[t]he recommendations of the Secretary to the Attor ney General shall be binding on the Attor ney General as to [the] scientific and medical\" evaluation of substances considered for scheduling). Plain tiffs make no plausible allegations of bias on the part of the S ecretary. Futility on account of bias has, therefore, not been adequately alleged. The Supreme Court has further stated that exhaustion may be un neces sary where the admin is- trative process would be incapable of granting ade- quate relief. See McCarthy , 503 U.S. at 147. That second exception, too, is inapposite at the moment. Al- though Plain tiffs style their claims in many different ways, the gravamen of their argu ment is that mari - juana should not be classified as a Schedule I sub - stance under the CSA. Were a court to agree, the remedy would be to re - or deschedule cannabis. It cannot be seriously argued that this remedy is not avail able through the admin istrative process. It is precisely the remedy provided under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq . Plain tiffs are therefore not currently entitled to bypass exhaustion under this second exception either. Finally, exhaustion may be un neces sary where pursuing agency review would subject plain tiffs to App. 17a undue prejudice. McCarthy , 503 U.S. at 146 -47. In particular, \"an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for admin istrative action\" may sufficient ly prejudice plain tiffs to justify a federal court in taking a case prior to the complete exhaustion of admin istrative remedies. Id. at 147. Not every delay will be sufficient ly severe to justify waiver, however. Although , in most cases, \" respond ents would clearly prefer an imme diate appeal . . . rather than the often lengthy admin istrative review process,\" a mere p refer ence for speedy resolution is not enough. Heckler v. Ringer , 466 U.S. 602, 619 (1984). \"[T]hreatened or impending irreparable injury flowing from delay incident to following the prescribed [admin istrative] procedure\" militates in favor of waiving exhaustion, but only if there is a \"strong showing . . . both [of] the inadequacy of the prescribed procedure and of impending harm.\" Aircraft & Diesel Equip. Corp. v. Hirsch , 331 U.S. 752, 773 -74 (1947). Despite the apparently dire situation of some of the Plain tiffs, they do not yet meet the require ment for this exception to the exhaustion require ment . In point of fact, the existing classificatory scheme has not prevented Plain tiffs Bortell, Cotte, or Belen from obtaining their allegedly life -saving medication. N or have Plain tiffs otherwise explained how pursuing agency review would subject them to an additional \"irreparable injury flowing from delay incident\" to the admin istrative process itself. Id. at 773. Accord ingly, despite their concededly difficult position, Plain tiffs are not currently entitled to bypass agency review. App. 18a C. United States v. Kiffer Does Not Require That We Waive Exhaustion Here at the Moment The exhaustion require ment under the CSA is, however, prudential, not juris dictional. It is not mandated by the statute. Rather, it is a judicially- created admin istrative rule, applied by courts in their discretion. This explains why this Court has, on at least one previous occasion, considered a challenge to the scheduling of marijuana under the CSA without re- quiring exhaustion, in United States v. Killer , 477 F.2d 349 (2d Cir. 1973). That case is readily distin - guishable, however, and its holding does not mean that exhaustion should not be require d in the cur rent case at this time. The Killer Court began by observ ing that \"timely and successful use of th[e] admin istrative [process] would have obtained for [the] appel lants [in that case] the very relief they seek from us \u2014a decla- ration either that mari[j]uana should not be subject to the [CSA] or that it should be covered only in another schedule.\" Id. at 351. The Court began, then, with the assumption that exhaustion did apply. It waived the normal require ment only because of two fac tors that do not obtain in the instant case : first, because the \"appli cation of the . . . doctrine [of exhaustion] to criminal cases is generally not favored,\" id. at 352, and, second and more significantly, because, at the time Kiffer was heard, the federal government had taken the position that it did not have the power to re - or deschedule marijuana at all, as a result of foreign treaty commitment s, id. at 351. Under those circum- stance s, where \"there [wa]s some doubt whether appel - lants in fact [had] an admin istrative remedy,\" the Court declined to require exhaustion. Id. The instant App. 19a case is different. It is, of course, civil. And, as the D.C. Circuit has since held, foreign treaty commitment s have not divested the Attor ney General of the power to re- or deschedule marijuana. See Nat'l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Law (NORML) v. Drug Enforce ment Admin. , 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Kiffer 's result is therefore not controlling. In fact, the case's logic re- inforce s our conclusion that Plain tiffs should attempt to exhaust their admin istrative remedies before seeking relief from us. But Kiffer also makes clear that, when appro priate, we do have the power to act even if the admin istrative agency has not. D. Strong Interests Compel This Court to Retain Jurisdiction This case reaches us as an appeal from a ruling on a motion to dismiss. Under settled principles of adjudication, we must, therefore, accept the well - pleaded facts in the complaint as true. Taking the facts as alleged, and, accord ingly, taking the su pposed benefits some Plain tiffs have experienced from mari - juana as true as well, we \u2014like the District Court below \u2014are struck by the transformative effects this drug has assertedly had on some Plain tiffs' lives. As a result, we are troubled by the uncer tainty under which Plain tiffs must currently live. Plain tiffs claim that marijuana has extended their lives, cured seizures, and made pain manageable. If true, these are no small things. Plain tiffs should not be require d to live indefinitely with uncertainty about their access to allegedly life -saving medication or live in fear that pursuing such medical treat ment may subject them or their loved ones to devastating consequences. App. 20a Plain tiffs argue that the admin istrative process will prolong their ordeal intolerably. And their argu - ment is not without force. Plain tiffs document that the average delay in deciding petitions to reclassify drugs under the CSA is approx imately nine years. Such long delays cast doubt on the appropriateness of requiring exhaustion. Accord Gibson v. Berryhill , 411 U.S. 564, 575 n.14 (1973). And where, as here, health is involved, delay can be even more problematic. See Abbey v. Sullivan , 978 F.2d 37, 46 (2d Cir. 1992) (observing that, \"if the delay attend ing exhaustion would subject claimants to deteriorating health . . . then waiver [of exhaustion] may be appro priate\"). Indeed, on the alleged facts, which, we repeat, we must for now take as true, undue delay by the agency might make applicable each of the three exceptions to exhaustion that the Supreme Court has recog nized and which we discussed earlier. Specifically, undue delay, if it in fact results in catastrophic health consequences, could make exhaustion futile. Moreover, the relief the agency might provide could, because of undue delay, become inadequate. And finally, and obviously, Plain tiffs could be unduly prejudiced by such delay. To be clear, Plain tiffs have not alleged that they will necessarily suffer sufficient harm as a result of the time it would take to pursue the admin istrative process to justify an exception to exhaustion now. Plain tiffs do, however, plausibly raise the specter of delay a nd plausibly suggest that the delay could become problematic. And although agencies, like legislatures, are often the best decision-makers, this is so only when they actually do decide. App. 21a Courts have, moreover, on occasion deemed it prop - er to encourage prompt decision-making. Thus, where agencies have a history of dilatory proceedings, federal courts have sometimes retained juris diction of related cases to facilitate swift review. In Telecommu nications Research and Action Center v. F.C.C. , 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984), our sister circuit retained juris diction of a case in part because of the failure of a federal agency to act with adequate speed. See 750 F.2d at 80 - 81. \"Whether or not the[] [agency's] delays would justify mandamus,\" the court stated, they were significant enough that it should retain juris diction to promote a quick resolution. Id. at 81 ; see also, e.g. , In re Pesticide Action Network N. Am. , 532 F. App 'x 649, 652 (9th Cir. 2013) (summary order) (observing that \"it is well estab lished that we may retain juris diction over [a case] to ensure that [the agency] -69 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring). 4 We think it possible that future acti on by us may become appro priate here. Plain tiffs have not asked for\u2014and we do not even consider issuing \u2014a writ of mandamus to force the DEA to act. But we exercise our discretion to keep juris diction of the case in this panel, to take what ever action may become appro pri- ate if Plain tiffs seek admin istrative review and the DEA fails to act promptly. And we note that, under 4 Some courts in other juris dictions have gone even fur ther in asserting a role for courts to ensure prompt action by lawmakers. See Vincent v. Pabst Brewing Co. , 177 N.W.2d 513, 517 (Wis. 1970) ; Corte Cost., 24 ottobre 2018, n. 207 (It.) ; see gen erally Guido Calabresi, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes (1982), especially id. at 35 -37. We wish to make clear that we make no such assertion of power in the fed eral courts gen erally. App. 22a the unusual health -related circumstance s of this case, what has counted as appro priate speed in the past may not count as appro priate speed here. In doing this, we specify that we are not retaining juris diction to review the actions the agency may take. Juris diction over those may well lie solely in another circuit. Nor do we intend to retain jurisdiction indefinitely. Unless the Plain tiffs seek agency review and so inform us within six months, we will affirm the District Court's judgment dismissing this case. ( And if only some Plain tiffs seek agency review, we will dismiss the complaint as to those who do not.) But if Plain tiffs do seek agency review, and the agency fails to act with alacrity, Plain tiffs may return directly to us, under our retained juris diction.5 To be clear, we repeat that this case remains in our purview only to the extent that the agency does not respond to Plain tiffs with adequate, if deliberate, speed. In other words, we retain jurisdiction exclusively for the purpose of inducing the agency to act promptly. 5 Because Plain tiffs' allegations with respect to the catastrophic harm they are facing are not implausible, we must take them as true at this stage of the liti gation. Should the agency fail to act, we would, before pro ceeding fur ther, how ever, have to look into the allegations more deeply. Accord ingly, should the case return to us, it may be appro priate to remand to the District Court for further fact -finding. At that time, if Plain tiffs have not at least raised a disputed issue of material fact as to the veracity of their allegations, sum mary judg ment against them would be appro pri- ate. App. 23a CONCLUSION Because Plain tiffs failed to exhaust their admin - istrative remedies and do not at this time qualify for an exception to the exhaustion doctrine, the District Court did not err in requiring Plain tiffs to bring their claims to the relevant agency first. But, in light of the unusual circumstance s of this case, we hold the case in abeyance and retain jurisdiction in this panel to take what ever further action might become appro priate should Plain tiffs initiate admin istrative review and the admin istrative process fail to operate with adequate dispatch. App. 24a DISSENTING OPINION BY JUDGE DENNIS JACOBS DENNIS JACOBS , Circuit Judge , dissenting : The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the classi fi- cation of marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance is un- constitutional because it does not reflect con temporary learning regard ing the drug's medicinal uses. I agree with the District Court that this case must be dismis- sed for failure to exhaust admin istrative reme dies in the Drug Enforce ment Agency (\"DEA\"). The majority opinion does not actually disagree, though it seems to treat lack of juris diction as a prudential speed bump. I dissent from the majority opinion's decision to hold the case in abeyance so that we may turn back to it if, at some future time, we get juris dic- tion. The majority posits that juris diction may materialize if the plain tiffs, claiming emergency , do not obtain a prompt decision on their not -yet filed petition to the DEA -but this seems to be no all -fired emergency, given that the plain tiffs are afforded half a year to file a petition on which hang supposed \"serious, life -or-death\" consequences. Majority Op. 3. For the following reasons, the plain tiffs' claims of emergency are tenuous, and constitute a further argu - ment against retaining juris diction that we do not have in order to hurry along an admin istrative deci- sion on a petition that has not been filed. Plain tiffs Dean Bortell and Sebastien Cotte sue on behalf of their severely ill children, who rely on marijuana for treat ment . Bortell and Cotte concede that their children get all the treat - ment they need, incl uding marijuana, and App. 25a dwell in states that do not outlaw it or that do not enforce any vestigial prohibition ; their grounds for claiming urgency are that their children are unable to take that medicine with them if they travel onto federal lands or into states where marijuana is illegal. The parents add that they suffer fear they might be subject to federal prosecution because they are involved in their children's medical treat ment . I view these claims as contrived and fanciful. Nobody need fear severe conse quences for administering medical marijuana to sick children. Jose Belen is a veteran with post -traumatic stress disorder who successfully uses marijuana to manage his symptoms, but complains that his travel is restricted an d that he cannot take full advantage of his veterans benefits (presumably for the government to pay for the marijuana). Plain tiff Marvin Washington asserts that he is impeded from seeking federal aid to expand his business so that he can sell canna bis products. No emergency here, and likely no stand ing either. Finally, the Cannabis Cultural Asso ciation assists people of color who wish to participate in the cannabis industry but who cannot because they jumped the gun, and have been arrested or convicted for cannabis use. I cannot see that this Asso ciation has stand ing to chal- lenge the classification of marijuana under the App. 26a nation's drug laws, let alone to seek an emergency resolution of that issue. [ * * * ] As to the Judg ment below, which dismissed the claims for failure to exhaust admin istrative remedies, I agree with the District Court -and with the majority opinion, which agrees that exhaustion is require d (at least for now). I part company with the majority opinion insofar as it holds the case in abeyance with the expectation of taking some measures if the DEA fails to act with \"adequ ate dispatch.\" Majority Op. 27. Our failure to dismiss the case now is error for several reasons that are easily stated. First, it is common ground that the case was properly dismissed under 12(b)(1) for failure to exhaust remedies ; so neither this C ourt nor the District Court has juris diction to grant a remedy. And we cannot simply decide to wait for juris diction that (as we are properly ruling) we do not have. Our job as a circuit court is to issue mandates. We do not fulfill the require ment s of the job by holding a case in abeyance on the off chance that we may get juris diction to decide it in the future. Second, the terms of the hold on this case are without content : we may take \" what ever further action\" if the agency fails to act \"promptly\" or \"with alacrity\". Majority Op. 25 -27. This is of no hel p- the DEA is unlikely to discern what \"adequate dispatch\" or \" appro priate speed\" may mean for an App. 27a issue that (as the majority opinion observes) \"stretch[es] back decades\". 1 Majority Op. 2. [ * * * ] Given all this, it would be surprising if solid prec- edent supported this procedural invention. The majority opinion adduces none. The majority thinks that United States v. Kiffer , 477 F.2d 349 (2d Cir. 1973), \"makes clear that, when appro priate, we do have the power to act even if the admin istrative agency has not.\" Majority Op. 22. But in that case, the Court excused admin istrative exhaustion only because the defend ant had shown that exhaustion would be futile and unduly pre judicial. Id. at 351 -352 (\"[I]t appears now that the admin istrative route for [the defend ants] would at best provide an uncertain and indefinitely delayed remedy . . . [and impose on them a] severe burden.\"). Accord ingly, Kiffer stands only for the un controversial proposition that exhaustion may be excused where it would be futile or unduly prejudicial; it does not condone waiting around until an exception is met. The majority opinion ( correctly) concludes that the plain tiffs do not meet the require - ment s for either exception. The relevance of Kiffer ends there. 1 The majority opinion also limits its \"purview\" to a fail ure of the agency to act with \"adequate, if deliberate, speed.\" Majority Op. 26. The echo of that phrase from Brown v. Board of Edu cation II is unfortunate, how ever, given that, in the many decades since, school integratio n is an unfinished project. The phrase seems to be derived from Admiralty law in the days of sail, which likewise offers no useful context. And in Francis Thompson's \"Hound of Heaven, \" \"deliberate speed\" is the pace by which God pursues us. No help there e ither. App. 28a The majority opinion relies on Telecommu nications Research & Action Center v. F.C.C ., 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\" TRAC v. F.C.C .\"); but that Court decided a mandamus petition (none is before us here). More - over, the court did not hold the case in abeyance, but retained juris diction (that it already had) only to ensure that the agency fulfilled its sua sponte promise to address the issue expeditiously. And the court gave the agency specific direction. Id. at 80 -81 (directing the agency to advise the Court of its progress every 60 days). The majority opinion's \" e.g.\" cite to a single Ninth Circuit summary order does not bespeak a wealth of examples. In that case as well, the court considered a mandamus petition. It decided that a writ of manda- mus was not warranted, and declined to retain juris - diction, citing only TRAC v. F.C.C. for the proposition that it could have retained juris diction if it wanted to. In re Pesticide Action Network N. Am. , 532 F. App'x 649, 652 (9th Cir. 2013). (The Pesticide classifies itself as \"well -estab lished\"-often a tell that the point is a novation.) The majority's remaining author ity, a concurring opinion by Judge Calabresi, advances th e speculative idea that courts may prod government when laws outlive the views of the Bien pensant community. None of these cases sup- ports the idea that a court is permitted to hold a case in abeyance because the court may on contingency gain juris diction to hear it, and can bully the agency in the meantime. As near as I can make it out, the holding of the majority opinion is : a court without juris diction should proceed with cautio n. [ * * * ] App. 29a I doubt that the DEA will be hurrying its work on an appli cation that these plain tiffs have not yet filed, seeking admin istrative action on an old and ramified controversy . Unless the panel opinion precipitates a swift admin istrative rejection, there is no reason to anticipate a swift ruling that entails the assess ment of countervailing risks, the pendency of legislation, and the eliciting of opinions on issues of medicine and public health. So I fully expect to see further proceed- ings in this appeal. No one can tell what this panel could do then, or (more accurately) would do. In the meantime, the one thing that will not happen is the issuance of the mandate, since I presume the majority will not thus oust this panel and this Court of the ability to take \" what ever further action\" may be neces - sary. Majority Op. 26. As and when this case returns to this Court and this panel, I will be an interested and bemused spectator.

JEFF ERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III, ET AL. , Defend ants. ________________________ No. 17 Civ. 5625 (AKH) Before : Alvin K. HELLERSTEIN, United States District Judge . ALVIN K. HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J. : Plain tiffs - tiffs\") filed this action on July 24, 2017. Broadly stated, plain tiffs assert an as -applied constitutional challenge to the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., which a Schedule App. 33a I drug \u2014the highest level of drug classi fication. Plain - tiffs attempt to demonstrate the CSA's constitutional infirmity in a number of ways, but the gravamen of the complaint is that the current scheduling of mari - juana violates due process because it lacks a rational basis. On September 8, 2017, plain tiffs moved the Court for an order to show cause why a temporary restraining order should not issue. The Court denied plain tiffs' motion that same day, and issued a summary order confirming that result on September 11, 2017. See Order Denying a Temporary Restraining Ord er, ECF 26. After initially indicating a willingness to proceed into discovery, the Court reconsidered and entered a briefing schedule advancing defend ants' motion to dismiss the complaint , see Order, ECF 33, filed Octo- ber 13, 2017 under Federal Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The Court held oral argu ment on February 14, 2018. For the reasons discussed in this opinion, the defend - ants' motion to dismiss the complaint is granted. BACKGROUND In response to President Nixon's \"war on drugs,\" Congress passed the Com prehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 10 (2005). \"Title II of the Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., is the Controlled Substances Act ('CSA'), and it 'repealed most of the earlier antidru g laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the international and interstate traffic in illicit drugs.\"' United States v. Green, 222 F. Supp. 3d 267, 271 (W.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting Raich, 545 U.S. at 7, 12). Congress made a number of findings associated with the CSA, including App. 34a that \"[t]he illegal importation, manufacture, distri bu- tion, and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the Amer ican people.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(2). \"The Act covers a large number of substances, each of which is assigned to one of five schedules ; this statutory classification deter mine s the sever ity of possible criminal penalties as well as the type of controls imposed.\" United States v. Kiffer, 477 F.2d 349, 350 (2d Cir. 1973) ; see also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(a). When the CSA was enacted, Congress classified mari - juana as a Schedule I drug. \"This preliminary class - ification was based, in part, on the recommend ation of the Assistant Secretary of [the Depart ment of Health, Education, and Welfare] that marihuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway.\" Raich, 545 U.S. at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to fall within Schedule I, Congress deter mine d that a drug must have : (1) \"a high potential for abuse,\" (2) \"no currently accepted medical use in treat ment in the United States,\" and (3) \"a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). The chart below describes the GSA's various schedules and the find- ings require d for each : App. 35a Statutory Factors Examples Schedule I High potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treat ment , and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical super vision. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(l). Heroin, LSD, Marijuana Schedule II High potential for abuse, some currently accepted medical use in treat ment , and abuse may lead to severe psycho logical or physical depen - Schedule III Potential for abuse less than sub stances in Schedules I and II, some currently accepted medical use in treat ment , and abuse may lead to moderate or low physical depen dence or high psycho logical Schedule IV Potential for abuse less than subs tances in Sched ule III, some currently accepted medical use in treat - ment , and abuse may lead to limited physical or psy cho- logical dependence. See 21 \u00ae Diazepam Potential for abuse less than substan ces in Sched ule IV, some currently accepted medical use in treat - ment , and abuse may lead to limited physical or physical dependence. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(5). Robitussin AC \u00ae After placing marijuana in I, \" Congress estab lished a process for reclassification, vesting the Attor ney General with the power to reclassify a drug 'on the record after oppor tunity for a hearing.' '' Green, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 271 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a)). Before b eginning the reclassification process, the Attor ney General must seek a scientific and medical evaluation from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), whose findings are binding on the Attor ney General. Id. \u00a7 811(b). In the relevant imple - ment ing regu lations, the Attor ney General has delegated this reclassification author ity to the Drug Enforce ment Agency (\"DEA\"). See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100(b). App. 37a The CSA also provides an avenue for interested parties to petitio n the DEA to reclassify drugs, con- sistent with the medical and scientific data provided by HHS. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a) ( providing that the Attor ney General may reclassify drugs after an on the record hearing \"on the petition of any interested party\") ; see also 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.43(a). If a petitioner receives an adverse ruling from the DEA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 provides for judicial review of the DEA's deter- mination in the D.C. Circuit, or another appro priate Circuit : All final determinations, findings, and con- clusions of the Attor ney General under this subchapter shall be final and conclusive deci- sions of the matters involved, except that any person aggrieved by a final decision of the Attor ney General may obtain review of the decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit in which his principal place of business is located upon petition filed with the court and delivered to the Attor ney General within thirty days after notice of the decision. Find ings of fact by the Attor ney General, if supported by substantial evi- dence , shall be conclusive . \"Despite considerable efforts to reschedule marijuana, it remains a Schedule I drug.\" Raich, 545 U.S. at 15. \"As of 2005, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had reviewed petitions to reschedule marijuana on five separate occasions over the course of 30 ye ars, [and upheld] the DEA's determination in each instance.\" Green, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 272. In 2011, the DEA denied a rescheduling petition, see Deni al of App. 38a Petition to Initiate Proceedings to Reschedule Mari - juana, 76 Fed. Reg. 40,552 (July 8, 2011), and the D.C. Circuit upheld the DEA's determination in Amer icans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforce ment Admin istration, 706 F.3d 438, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2013). The DEA denied another resched uling petition as recently as 2016. See Deni al of Petition to Initiate Proceedings to Reschedule Marijuana, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,767 (Aug. 12, 2016). 1 DISCUSSION Defend ants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court must accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all rea- sonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Gregory v. Daly, 243 F.3d 687, 691 (2d Cir. 2001), as amended (Apr. 20, 2001). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' '' Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the plain tiff pleads factual c ontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defend ant is liable for the mis conduct alleged.\" Id. A. Exhaustion and Plaintiff s' Rational Basis Claim Properly understood, plain tiffs have raised a collateral challenge to the admin istrative decision not to reclassify marijuana. As such, plain tiffs' claim 1 It appears that one chal lenge to the DEA's de termination was filed in the Tenth Circuit, but the petition was dis missed as untimely. See Order, Krumm v. DEA , 16-9557 (10th Cir. Dec. 15, 2016). App. 39a premised on the factors found in Section 812 of the CSA is barred because plain tiffs failed to exhaust their admin istrative remedies. Even if the Court were to reach th e merit of plain tiffs' rational basis claim, I hold that plain tiffs have failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The parties first present a threshold ques tion of statutory interpretation, the resolution of which illustrates that plain tiffs' claim is an admin istrative one, not one premised on the constitution. Plain tiffs contend that, in analyzing the rationality of the CSA, Congress should be bound by the factors s et out in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1), which include a finding that a drug has \"no currently accepted medical use in treat ment in the United States.\" Alter natively, defend ants suggest that the Section 812 factors apply only to reclassification determinations by the Attor ney General, as set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a). Put differently, the ques tion is whether the statutory factors outlined in Section 812(b)(1) are imputed into the constitutional analysis, thereby binding Congress to particular factors in conducting rational basis review. A fair reading of the statute reveals that the factors set out in Section 812 apply only to the Attor - ney General's reclassification proceedings-they do not bind Congress on rational basis review. A s explained above, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a) vests the Attor ney General with the author ity, through his or her designated agent, to reclassify particular drugs if he or she : (1) \"finds that such drug or other substance has a potential for abuse, and,\" (2) \"makes with respect to such drug or other substance the findings prescribed by subsection (b) of section 812 of this title.\" And 21 App. 40a U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b) states that \"[t]he findings require d for each of the schedules are as follows,\" and thereafter lists the three relevant factors, including, as relevant here, whether the drug has any currently accepted medical uses. Read in context with Section 811(a), it is clear that the fa ctors listed in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1) were intended to apply only to the executive officials in reclassification proceedings. More fundamentally, as a constitutional matter I am persuaded by the logic of the opinion of Judge Wolford of the Western District of New York in United States v. Green, who analyzed this ques tion as follows : It is difficult to conclude that marijuana is not currently being used for medical pur- poses\u2014it is. There would be no rational basis to conclude otherwise. And if that were the central ques tion in this case, Defend ants' argu ment would have merit \u2014but it is not the central ques tion. . . . The issue is not whether it was rational for Congress or the DEA to conclude that there is no currently accepted medical use for marijuana \u2014that would be the issue if a claim were brought in a circuit court challenging the DEA's admin istrative determination. Rather, the constitutional issue for equal protection pur- poses is, simply, whether there is any conceivable basis to support the placement of marijuana on the most stringent schedule under the CSA. 222 F. Supp. 3d at 275 -80. App. 41a By framing their claim in terms of the statutory factors outlined in Section 812(b)(1), plain tiffs' lawsuit is best understood as a collateral attack on the various admin istrative determinations not to reclassify marijuana into a different drug schedule. As such, plain tiffs' claim is barred becaus e plain tiffs failed to exhaust their admin istrative remedies. The exhaustion rule generally require s \"that parties exhaust prescribed admin istrative remedies before seeking relief from the federal courts.\" McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 -45 (1992) ; see also Beharry v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 56 (2d Cir. 2003), as amended (July 24, 2003) (\"The general rule is that 'a party may not seek federal judicial review of an adverse admin istrative determination until the party has first sought all possible relief within the agency itself.' (quoting Howell v. INS, 72 F.3d 288, 291 (2d Cir. 1995))). \"Exhaustion is require d because it serves the twin purposes of protecting admin istrative agency author ity and promoting judicial efficiency.\" McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145. However, because federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the juris - diction given them,\" three excep tions to the exhaustion require ment have emerged. Id. at 146 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 -18 (1976)). The Supreme Court has explained these exceptions as follows : First, requiring resort to the administrative remedy may occasion undue prejudice to subsequent assertion of a court action. Such prejudice may result, for example, from an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for App. 42a admin istrative action. . . . Second, an admin - istrative reme dy may be inadequate because of some doubt as to whether the agency was empowered to gran t effec tive relief . . . . Third, an admin istrative remedy may be inadequate where the admin istrative body is shown to be biased or has otherwise pre - deter mine d the issue before it. Id. 145-49 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564,575 n.14 (1973)). None of these exceptions applies here. Plain tiffs first suggest that the relief they seek\u2014 a declaration that the CSA is unconstitutional \u2014differs from the relief avail able in an admin istrative forum, which is limited to rescheduling based on the criteria in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). But while framed in different terms, these two remedies are ultimate ly two sides of the same coin. Although plain tiffs couch their claim in constitutional language , they seek the same relief as would be avail able in an admin istrative forum \u2014a change in marijuana's scheduling classifi cation\u2014based on the same factors that guide the DEA's reclassification determination. As a district court in this Circuit recently explained, \"[w]hen [this] argument is dissected, it essentially becomes an attack on the scheduling of marijuana based on the criteria set forth in the statute.\" Green , 222 F. Supp. 3d. at 273. The exhaustion require ment therefore bars plain tiffs' claims. To avoid this result, plain tiffs rely on United States v. Kiffer, 477 F.2d 349 (2d Cir. 1973). Plain tiffs do so in er ror. In Kiffer, criminal defend ants convicted of marijuana possession challenge d the constitution- ality of the CSA under the rational basis test. Kiffer, App. 43a 477 F.2d at 350. Responding to this very exhaustion claim, the Second Circuit held that \"the admin istra- tive route for these appel lants would at best provide an uncertain and indefinitely delayed remedy,\" and declined to require admin istrative exha ustion. Id. at 351-52. But at the time Kiffer was decided, the designated executive official had taken the position that he was barred by a treaty from even considering a petition to reclassify marijuana. Green, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 273 -74 (noting that \"it was doubt ful whether an admin istrative remedy actually existed\") ; see also Kiffer, 477 F.2d at 351 -52. The D.C. Circuit later rejected that position. See Nat'l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974) ; see also Nat'l Org. for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Kiffer is also distinguishable on a more funda- mental ground : The Court held that imposing the exhaustion require ment would also be unduly burdensome to criminal defend ants challenging their convictions. See Kiffer, 477 F.2d at 353 (\"Second, even assuming the existence of a viable admin istrative remedy, appli cation of the exhaustion doctrine to criminal cases is generally not favored because of 'the severe burden' it imposes on defend ants.\" (quoting McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185,197 (1969))). Those concerns are less forceful in the civil context, especially given that the DEA no longer takes the position that it is categorically barred by a treaty from considering reclassification petitions. 2 2 Plain tiffs also claim that the admin istrative review process is futile because the relevant executive officials are biased against their cause and will not faithfully co nsider the relevant med ical App. 44a Even if the Court were to reach the merits of plain tiffs' rational basis claim, I would be bound by precedent to reject it. 3 The Second Circuit has already resolved this ques tion in United States v. Kiffer, 477 F.2d at 355 -57, which upheld the constitutionality of the CSA. Every other court to consider this issue has held similarly. 4 Even without the benefit of precedent, evidence. See FAC, ECF 23, at \u00b6\u00b6 357-70. But this claim is undercut by the stat utory scheme, which spe cifically re quires these officials to defer to HHS on scientific and med ical ques - tions. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(b). 3 Plain tiffs rely heavily on United States v. Pickard, 100 F. Supp. 3d 981, 996 (E.D. Cal. 2015), for the prop osition that the CSA is not \"insulated from con stitutional review by Con gressional delegation of author ity to an agency to c onsider an admin istra- tive petition.\" But as explained above, by raising this chal lenge based on the factors set out in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1), plain tiffs' claim is properly understood as a collateral attack on the admin - istrative de termination no t to reclassify marijuana. To the extent that plain tiffs attempt to raise a typical rational basis claim based on whether Con gress had any conceivable basis to classify marijuana in Schedule I, which would not be the sub ject of an admin istrative pro ceeding, such a claim is barred by prec edent. 4 See, e.g., Sacramento Nonprofit Collective v. Holder, 552 F. App'x 680, 683 (9th Cir. 2014) (rejecting rational basis chal lenge to the CSA) ; Am. for Safe Access, F.3d at 449 holding the DEA's deci sion not to reclassify marijuana in a different schedule under the more stringent \"sub stantial evi dence\" stan dard) ; United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Co -op, 259 F. App'x 936, 938 (9th Cir. 2007) ; United States v. White Plume, 447 F.3 d 1067, 1075 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that the CSA's enforce ment against industrial hemp production was rationally related to a legitimate gov ernment pur pose) ; United States v. Greene, 892 F.2d 453, 455 (6th Cir. 1989) ; United States v. Fry, 787 F.2d 903, 905 (4th Cir. 1986) ; United States v. Fogarty, 692 F.2d 542, 547 (8th Cir. 1982) ; United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 823 (11th Cir. 1982). App. 45a it is clear that Congress had a rational basis for classifying marijuana in Schedule I, and executive officials in different admin istrations have consistently retained its placement there. 5 For instance, the DEA's most recent denial of a petition to reclassify marijuana listed a number of public health and safety justifications for keeping marijuana in Schedule I. See Deni al of Petition to Initiate Proceed ings to Reschedule Marijuana, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,767 (Aug. 12, 2016). The reasons offered by the DEA included marijuana's \"various psychoactive effects,\" id. at 53,774, its potential to cause a \"decrease in IQ and general neuropsychological performance \" for ado - lescents who consume it, id., and its potential effect on prenatal devel opment , id. at 53,775. Even if marijuana has current medical uses, I cannot say that Congress acted irrationally in placing marijuana in Schedule I. In sum, the Second Circuit has already deter - mine d that Congress had a rational basis to classify marijuana as a Schedule I drug, see United States v. Kiffer, 477 F.2d at 355 -57, and any constitutional rigidity is overcome by granting the Attor ney General, through a designated agent, the author ity to 5 Under the rational basis test, \"a stat utory classification that neither pro ceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fun damental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal pro tection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could pro vide a rational basis for the classification.\" F. C. C. v. Beach Commc'ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993). \"On rational - basis review, a classification in a statute . . . comes to [the court] tion of validity . . . and those attacking the rationality of the legis lative classification have the burden 'to negative every conceivable basis which might sup port it.''' Id. at 314-15 (quoting Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co, 410 U.S. 356, 364 (1973)). App. 46a reclassify a drug accord ing to the evidence before it and based on the criteria outlined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). There can be no complaint of constitution- al error when such a process is design ed to provide a safety valve of this kind. 6 The argu ment is made that Attor ney General's refusal, through the DEA, to quickly resolve reclassification petitions creates sloth. But that sloth, if presented in the appro priate case, can be overcome thro ugh a mandamus proceed- ing in the appro priate Court of Appeals. Judicial economy is not served through a collateral proceeding of this kind that seeks to undercut the regulatory machinery on the Executive Branch and the process of judicial review in the Court of Appeals. I emphasize that this decision is not on the merits of plain tiffs' claim. Plain tiffs' amended complaint , which I must accept as true for the purpose of this motion, claims that the use of medical marijuana has, quite literally, saved their lives. One plain tiff in this case, Alexis Borten, suffers from intractable epilepsy, a severe seizure disorder that o nce caused her to experience multiple seizures every day. After years of 6 As the Second Circuit explained in Kiffer : The provisions of the Act allowing periodic review of the control and classification of allegedly dangerous substances create a sensible mechanism for dealing with a field in which factual claims are conflicting and the state of scientific know ledge is st ill growing. The question whether a substance belongs in one schedule rather than another clearly calls for fine distinctions, but the statutory pro cedure at least offers the means for producing a thorough factual record upon which to base an informed judgment. Kiffer , 477 F.2d at 357. App. 47a searching for viable treat ment options, Alexis began using medical marijuana. Since then, she has gone nearly three years without a single seizure. Jagger Cotte, another plain tiff in the case, suffers from a rare, congenital disease known as Leigh's disease, which kills approx imately 95% of those afflicted before they reach the age of four. After turning to med- ical marijuana, Jagger's life has been extended by two years and his pain has become manageable. I highlight plain tiffs' experience to emphasize that this decision should not be understood as a factual finding that marijuana lacks any medical use in the Un ited States, for the author ity to make that determination is vested in the admin istrative process. In light of the decision of the Second Circuit, see United States v. Kiffer, 477 F.2d at 355 -57, and the several decisions of the D.C. Circuit, see, e.g., Am. for Safe Access, 706 F.3d at 449, I am require d to dismiss plain tiffs' rational basis claim. B. Standing and Plaintiff s' Equal Protection Claim The Cannabis Cultural Asso ciation, Inc. (\"CCA\"), a nonprofit entity dedicated to advancing the business footprint of marginalized groups in the cannabis industry, alleges that the CSA violates the Equal Pro- tection Clause because it was passed with racial animus. See FAC, ECF 23, \u00b6\u00b6 406-21. Defendants claim that the CCA lacks stand ing to maintain this claim and, alter natively, that the CCA has failed to state an Equal Protection claim. I hold that the CCA lacks stand ing to maintain its Equal Protection claim because plain tiffs have fa iled to demonstrate that a favorable decision is likely to redress plain tiffs' alleged injuries. App. 48a To satisfy the \"irreducible constitutional mini- mum of stand ing,\" a \" plain tiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the chal- lenge d conduct of the defend ant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016), as revis ed (May 24, 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). Specifically, \"[t]o) estab lish injury in fact, a plain tiff must show that he or she suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. ''' Id. at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). \"The plain tiff, as the party invoking federal juris diction, bears the burden of estab lishing these elements.\" Id. at 1547. Plain tiffs do not claim that the CCA has stand ing to sue on its own behalf, but rather is suing on behalf of its members. In general, an association has stand ing to brin g suit on behalf of its members when : (a) its members would otherwise have stand ing to sue in their own right ; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organ ization's purpose ; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested require s the parti ci- pation of individual members in the lawsuit. Centro de la Comunidad Hispana de Locust Valley v. Town of Oyster Bay, 868 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hunt v. Washington Apple Advert. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)). App. 49a In opposing this motion, plain tiffs submitted three affidavits from members of the CCA : Kordell Nesbitt, Leo Bridgewater, and Thomas Motley. See Declaration of Michael S. Hiller, ECF 43, Ex. 12 -14. Kordell Nesbitt, the first affiant, is an African Amer i- can male and a member of the CCA. See Declaration of Michael S. Hiller, ECF 43, Ex . 12, \u00b6\u00b6 1. Mr. Nesbitt was charged in 2013 with participating in a marijuana conspiracy, and he pled guilty in 2014. See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 2- 3. He claims that he continues to face collateral consequences as a result of his conviction, including difficulty fin ding employ ment . See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Leo Bridgewater, the second affiant, is a veteran of the U.S. Army who previously served as a tele commu ni- cations specialist. See Declaration of Michael S. Hiller, ECF 43, Ex. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Mr. Bridgewater began using medical cannabis in 2015 and claims that, as a result, he cannot renew the government security clearance neces sary to work as a private military con- tract or. See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.7 Finally, Thomas Motley, like Mr. Nesbitt, is an African -Amer ican male who was indicted and pled guilty to violating federal law by participating in a conspiracy to distribute and cultivate marijuana. See Declaration of Michael S. Hiller, ECF 43 , Ex. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Mr. Motley also states that although he would like to participate in a minority -owned business loan or grant, he believes that his prior felony conviction would make him ineligible to do so. See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. 7 Although Mr. Nesbitt and Mr. Motley claim that they are African -Amer ican, Mr. Bridgewater's affi davit does not dis close his ethnicity. This technicality does not affect the Court's reason ing. App. 50a Although the affidavits demonstrate that members of the CCA have suffered an injury -in-fact, 8 the plead - ings fail to demonstrate that \"it is likely that a favorable ruling will redress\" those injuries. Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007). Plain tiffs' FAC seeks \"a permanent injunction . . . restraining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis.\" FAC, ECF 23, at 97. But plain tiffs have not shown that, were they to receive a favorable ruling that marijuana cannot be treated as a Schedule I drug, their prior convictions would be undone. 9 Nor have plain tiffs shown, for instance, that those within the government in charge of sec urity clearance determinations would no longer include marijuana in a urine test if plain tiffs are successful in 8 Defend ants are cor rect that City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983) forecloses plain tiffs' claims that they have stand ing based on a fear of future arrest. See Plain tiffs' Memo - randum of Law in Oppo sition, ECF 44, at 56. How ever, each of the ind ividuals who sub mitted an affi davit suffers from a forward -looking injury -in-fact that is concrete, par ticularized, and imminent. For instance, Mr. Nesbitt claims, with doc u- mentation from a potential employer, that his prior con viction has har med his ability to obtain future employ ment. As described above, other affiants have similar claims that are suf - ficient to demonstrate an injury -in-fact. 9 The Supreme Court recently held for the first time that a guilty plea, stand ing alone, does not bar a criminal defend ant from challenging the con stitutionality of the statute of his con viction on direct appeal Class v. United States, No. 16 -424, 2018 WL 987347, at *8 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2018). But the chal lenge here is even more attenuated, fo r plain tiffs are not challenging their underlying con victions, either on direct appeal or in habeas pro - ceedings. Plain tiffs have presented no basis, even a spe culative one, explaining how a favorable deci sion in this case would redress their alle ged injuries. App. 51a having marijuana reclassified to a different drug schedule. Although one could imagine how plain tiffs might connect these dots, plain tiffs bear the burden of plead ing each element of stand ing, and their various submissions have failed to do so. Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547. Alter natively, even if plain tiffs had stand ing, I hold that plain tiffs fail to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6 ). To survive a motion to dismiss an Equal Pro- tection claim, plain tiffs must plausibly plead that \"the decision-maker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" Pers. Adm'r of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979) ; see also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976) (holding th at a law violates the equal protection clause if passed with discriminatory purpose). If a plain tiff plausibly pleads such a claim, a law is then subject to strict constitutional scrutiny, which holds that \"such classifications are constitu- tional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling government al interests.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). Plain tiffs' racial ani mus claim is based on a patchwork of state ment s by former Nixon Admin istra- tion officials, many of which were made after the passage of the CSA. See FAC, ECF 23, at \u00b6\u00b6 235-52. Even taking these allegations as true, plain tiffs have failed to demonstrate that the relevant decision- maker \u2014Congress \u2014passed the CSA and placed marijuana order to inten tionally inate against African Amer icans. See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (recognizing that the relevant \" decision- maker\" in the case was the \"state legislature\") ; United App. 52a States v. Then, 56 F.3d 464, 466 (2d Cir. 1995) (considering, in the context of the sentencing disparity between powder cocaine and crack cocaine, whether \"Congress \" acted \"with discriminatory intent in adopti ng the sentencing ratio at issue\"). Plain tiffs have cited no author ity for the prop osition that various state ment s by Executive Branch officials, such as those at issue here, which are untethered from the Congressional process, can support an Equal Pro- tection claim premised on racial animus. Therefore, even if plain tiffs could demonstrate stand ing, I would still hold that plain tiffs failed to state a claim. C. Remaining Constitutional Claims Plain tiffs advance a number of additional consti- tutional challenge s to the placement of marijuana in Schedule I under the CSA, independent of plain tiffs' rational basis challenge based on medical evidence , largely in order to subject the CSA to heightened con- stitutional scrutiny. Because plain tiffs have failed to state a claim under any constitutional theory, all of plain tiffs' remaining claims are also dismissed. Plain tiffs first claim that the GSA's regu lation of marijuana violates the Commerce Clause. There is no need to belabor this point. The Supreme Court has held, in no uncertain terms, that \"intrastate manu - facture and possession of marijuana for medical pur- poses,\" even if legal under state law, does not exceed Congress 's author ity under the Commer ce Clause. App. 53a Raich, 545 U.S. at 15. I am bound to apply this prec - edent and plain tiffs' claim under the Commerce Clause is therefore dismissed.10 Plain tiffs also appear to assert a fundamental right to use medical marijuana, which is then used to prop up plain tiffs' remaining causes of action. Plain - tiffs frame their claim as \"the right of Plain tiffs to exercise personal autonomy and to preserve their health and lives.\" See Plain tiffs' Memo randum of Law in Oppo sition, ECF 44, at 68. No such fundamental right exists. Every court to consider the specific, care- fully framed right at issue here has held that there is no substantive due process right to use medical marijuana. The Ninth Circuit, on rema nd from the Supreme Court's decision in Raich I, analyzed this ques tion in detail, holding that \" federal law does not recognize a fundamental right to use medical mari - juana prescribed by a licensed physician to alleviate excruciating pain and h uman suffering.\" Raich v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 850, 866 (9th Cir. 2007). Other 10 Apart from simply attempting to relitigate the issues firmly decided in Raich, plain tiffs argue that \"the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug under the CSA is void under the doctrine of desuetude. \" Plain tiffs' Memo randum of Law in Oppo - sition, ECF 44, at 92. Plain tiffs' argu ment borders on frivolous. \"Desuetude is the `obscure doctrine by which a legis lative enactment is judi cially abrogated following a long period of non - enforce ment.''' United States v. Morrison, 596 F. Supp. 2d 661, 702 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting Note, Desuetude, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 2209, 2209 (2006)). First of all, this civil law doctrine is not applicable in fed eral courts. See D C. v. John R Thompson Co., 346 U.S. 100, 113-14 (1953) (\"The fail ure of the executive branch to enforce a law does not result in its modification or repeal.\"). And even if this doctrine were viable, plain tiffs have not shown that the fed eral gov ernment has entirely abandoned appli cation o f the CSA as applied to marijuana. App. 54a courts have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Washington, 887 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1102 (D. Mont. 2012), adhered to sideration, No. CR 11 -61-M-DLC, 2012 WL 4602838 (D. Mont. Oct. 2, 2012) (rejecting a fundamental right to use medical marijuana and applying rational basis review) ; Elansari v. United States, No. CV 3 :15-1461, 2016 WL 4386145, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Aug. 17, 2016) (noting \"that 'no co urt to date has held that citizens have a consti- tutionally fundamental right to use medical marijuana' (quoting United States v. Wilde, 74 F. Supp. 3d 1092, 1095 (N.D. Ca. 2014))). 11 Accord ingly, plain tiffs' sub- stantive Due Process claim is dismis sed. Plain tiffs also raise an ill -defined right to travel claim. The thrust of this claim appears to be that because plain tiffs are more likely to be arrested for possession of medical marijuana if they travel by airplane o r enter federal buildings (where they might be subject to search), the CSA unconstitutionally infringes on their right to travel. Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 500 (1999) (defining one element of the right to travel as \" protect[ing] the right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State\"). This claim fails for substantially the same reasons already discussed above, for no fundamental right to use med- ical marijuana exists. As a general matter, the right to travel has been understood primarily as a restriction on state -created 11 Plain tiffs largely rely on Cruzan v. Direc tor, Missouri Depart - ment of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990) for the prop osition that \"a com petent person has a con stitutionally pro tected liberty interest in refusing unwanted med ical treat ment.\" But Cruzan speaks only to one's right to refuse medical treat ment, not a positive right to obtain any par ticular med ical treat ment. App. 55a obstructions to interstate travel, not as a bar on fed- eral regulatory schemes. See, e.g., Minnesota Senior Fed'n, Metro. Region v. United States, 273 F.3d 805, 810 (8th Cir. 2001) (n oting that \"the Court's other modern cases . . . have applied the federal constitu- tional right to travel to state legislation that had a negative impact on travel between the various states,\" rather than to a \"federal statutory regime because it allegedly deters interstate travel\"). The CSA is facially neutral as to travel \u2014it does not impose any bar on plain tiffs' move ment from state to state. See Five Borough Bicycle Club v. City of New York, 483 F. Supp. 2d 351, 362 (S.D.N.Y . 2007), aff'd, (\"A statute implicates the constitu- tional right to travel when it actually deters such travel, or when impedance of travel is its primary objective, or when it uses any classification which serves to pe nalize the exercise of that right\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Soto\u2014Lopez v. N.Y.C. Civil Serv. Comm' n, 755 F.2d 266, 278 (2d Cir. 1985))). Instead, the CSA makes possession and distri - bution of certain controlled substances, including marijuana, illegal, regardless of one's move ment between states. Properly understood, plain tiffs' com- plaint is simply that they are deterred from travel because they fear that they are more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession at airport security checkpoints. Such an interpretation of the right to travel, if adopted, would invalidate any number of bans on controlled substances or firearms simply because the enforce ment of these facially neutral laws might have some conceivable, tangential impact on travel. Plain tiffs have identified no author ity for such App. 56a an expansive interpretation of the right to travel, and the Court has not found any. A suggestion has been made that the CSA presents plain tiffs with a Hobson's choice between their fundamental right to use medical marijuana and a right to travel. But as explained above, no such fundamental right to use medical marijuana exists. Plain tiffs' right to travel claim is therefore dismissed. For substantially the same reasons, plain tiffs' First Amend ment claim also fails. The core of plain - tiffs' claim stems from the fact that Alexis Bortell has previously been invited to speak with members of Congress in Washington, D.C. about ongoing efforts to decriminalize medical marijuana, but cannot do so because she cannot fly on an airplane or ent er federal buildings without risking arrest and prosecution for marijuana possession under the CSA. But the First Amend ment protects freedom of speech, first and foremost. To be sure, the Supreme Court has extended constitutional protection to certain kinds of expressive conduct, but only such conduct that is \" sufficient ly imbued with elements of commu nication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amend ment s.\" Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409 (1974) ; see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) (\"We cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\"). Accord ingly, the Fi rst Amend ment 's protections have been extended \"only to conduct that is inherently expressive,\" see Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 66 (2006), such as burning the Amer ican flag, see Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 , 406 (1989), or App. 57a conducting a sit -in to protest racial segregation, see Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131 (1966). The CSA is not targeted at speech, nor does it directly implicate speech in any way. Laws of this kind, which are directed as \"commerce or co nduct,\" are not implicated by the First Amend ment simply because they impose \"incidental burdens on speech.\" Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 567 (2011) ; see also id. (\"[R]estri ctions on protected expression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more generally, on non -expressive conduct.\"). As the Supreme Court has explained, \"every civil and criminal remedy imposes some conceivable burden on First Amend ment protected activ ities,\" but such laws do not automatically warrant First Amend ment protection. Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 706 (1986). Put differently, \"the First Amend ment is not implicated by the enforce ment o' laws, like the CSA, which are \" directed at imposing sanctions on non - expressive activity.\" Id. at 707. Were plain tiffs correct, any law regulating possession of illegal substances, firearms, or any number of other things would be sub- ject to First Amend ment scrutiny simply because those who possess such items risk arrest by carrying them onto federal prop erty. And as explain ed above, because there is no fundamental right to use medical marijuana, plain tiffs do not face a Hobson's choice with respect to the exercise of their constitutional rights. For the reasons stated herein, defend ants' motion to dismiss the complaint is granted. Plain tiffs have already amended their complaint once, and I find that further amend ment s would be futile. Ruffolo v. Oppenheimer & Co., 987 F.2d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1993). App. 58a The clerk is instructed to terminate the motion (ECF 36), mark the case as closed, and tax costs as appro - priate.

App. 107a TRANSCRIPT OF THE ORAL ARGUMENT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (FEBRUARY 14, 2018) UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ________________________ MARVIN WASHINGTON, ET AL., Plaintiffs, v. JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD SESSIONS, III, ET AL., Defendants. ________________________ 17 Civ. 5625 (AKH) Before : Hon. Alvin K. HELLERSTEIN, District Judge. (Case called) THE COURT : The next time we hear that command \"all rise\" it may be that Aaron Judge has hit his first home run. This is Marvin Washington and others against Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, III in his official capacity as United States Attorney General and other offi cials and agencies of the government, 17 Civ. 5625. App. 108a Who is going to speak for the plaintiff? MR. HILLER : Your Honor, Michael Hiller of Hiller, PC. I'll be addressing five causes of action. With the Court's permission we would like Lauren Rudick to argue t he commerce clause claim and Joseph Bondy to argue \u2014 THE COURT : We are not going to do that. They can get up and answer to my specific questions, but I'll look to you, Mr. Hiller, to do it all. MR. HILLER : Very well, your Honor. THE COURT : Why don't you int roduce everyone else on your side. MR. HILLER : Again, Michael Hiller from Hiller, PC ; my partner, Lauren Rudick also of Hiller, PC ; Joseph Bondy ; David Holland. With the Court's permission I would just like to introduce the plaintiffs who are all represent ed here today. THE COURT : Sure. MR. HILLER : The first gentleman on the aisle is Jose Belen. The two gentlemen next to him are Jake Plowden and Nelson Guerrero from the Cannabis Cultural Association. Marvin Washington. Neil Bridgewater, also of the Cannabis Cultural Association. Dean and Liza Bortell, on behalf of Alexis Bortell. Lastly, Sebastian Cotte on behalf of his son, Jagger Cotte. THE COURT : Welcome, all. Defendants. MR. DOLINGER : Good morning, your Honor, Samuel Dolinger, Assistant United States At torney, for App. 109a the government. With me at counsel table is David S. Jones. THE COURT : Sorry? MR. DOLINGER : David Jones. THE COURT : Is Isodore Dolinger, the Bronx congress - man, your grandfather? MR. DOLINGER : He is not. Nor am I related to Magistrate Judge Dol inger. THE COURT : Just a coincidence. MR. DOLINGER : I think that's right, your Honor. THE COURT : Mr. Dolinger, you are up. It's your motion. MR. DOLINGER : Thank you. Your Honor, we are here on defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plain tiffs assert a variety of constitutional challenges to the federal regulation of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. Courts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them. The Court should do the same here . The briefs in support of our motion are lengthy, and I'm happy to answer any questions the Court has. THE COURT : I'll have them along the way. Make your argument. MR. DOLINGER : Thank you, your Honor. The plaintiffs' principal challenge sounds in due process, and they assert that the regulation of App. 110a marijuana on schedule 1 of the CSA violates the rational basis test. Under rational basis review, a law passed by Congress must only be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. This is the most deferential standard of review. Any conceivable basis will suffice. It need not be a stated basis that Congress made factual findings on or put into a record. A law has a presumption of rationality under this test. In order to state a claim the plaintiffs' complaint must negate every conceivable basis that could support the law, and they haven't done so here. Among the interests that Congress stated that it was\u2014 THE COURT : What is the relief that plaintiffs seek? MR. DOLINGER : As I understand it, your Honor, they seek the invalidation of the Controlled Substances Act as relates to marijuana. THE COURT : That narrow? MR. DOLINGER : I'm sorry, your Honor? THE COURT : Is it that narrow? MR. DOLINGER : I don't know whether they are seeking a broader invalidation of the Controlled Substances Act. It's my understanding. THE COURT : That's what you just said. Is it a validation of the act insofar as it places marijuana on schedule 1? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : That's by act of Congress in 1972? App. 111a MR. DOLINGER : 1970, your Honor. At the time of passage Congress stated that its goals were to protect public health and welfare from drug abuse and drug trafficking. In 1998, your Honor, Congress passed a supplemental statement in which it opposed the legalization of marijuana for medical use, citing the prevalence of its use and abuse by children under the age of 18. This is one of the many bases that Congress and others have cited for marijuana on schedule 1, is the potential of its abuse by children and thereby to protect the health of minors. There are also public safety concerns associated with marijuana use, including \u2014 THE COURT : There is another criteria also that's discussed. That is whether there was any medical use. Was there any finding on that by Congress in 19 \u2014when was the amendment, 1998? MR. DOLINGER : In 1998, there was no amendment, your Honor. It was a statement that was attached to appropriations legislation. THE COU RT: What effect is that? MR. DOLINGER : It states Congress' intent and findings and its opposition to the legalization of medical marijuana. THE COURT : It's a statement of general policy. It's nothing more than that. I don't know what kind of legal conseque nce it has. MR. DOLINGER : Among other things, your Honor, it's one of many legitimate rational bases that Congress could have \u2014 App. 112a THE COURT : This is 28 years after the law was passed. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. At the time the law was passed Cong ress had a rational basis for it as well. THE COURT : Seems to me the only test that's relevant is what was before the Congress in 1970. The escape valve in the law is a forward -seeking law. It created a schedule, set of schedules that would last, and Congr ess provided that from time to time there would be review. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. THE COURT : A later event doesn't necessarily invali - date the law. MR. DOLINGER : I think that's especially true in this case, as you are pointing out. THE COU RT: All I think about is that the 1998 law interfered with the due process set up by the law that would be in Attorney General review. MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, the congressional pur - pose in setting up this administrative review process was to permit the Atto rney General and his delegates to assess new scientific and medical information on controlled substances. THE COURT : Doesn't the 1998 pronouncement in the air by Congress, as it were, interfere with that process by the Attorney General or his delegee? MR. DOLINGER : No, your Honor. Because Congress isn't the ultimate decider here of federal drug policy. App. 113a THE COURT : Congress in 1970 passed a law. Congress acts only through laws. MR. DOLINGER : That's true, your Honor. THE COURT : If it's not a law, whatever Congress says doesn't have any legal consequence. MR. DOLINGER : This was, in fact, passed through an appropriations bill that did have the force of law. THE COURT : Which bill? MR. DOLINGER : It was the appropriations legislation for 1999. To your point, your Honor. THE COURT : Mr. Dolinger, don't go fast. You go faster than I can think. MR. DOLINGER : Sure, your Honor. My apologies. THE COURT : Let me stop you there. It's part of an appropriations bill appropriating money for the DEA, is that it? MR. DOLINGER : I believe it was omnibus general appropriations legislation. THE COURT : What does that have to do with what happened in 1970 or what the Attorney General is supposed to be considering in 1998 or today? MR. DOLINGER : The relevan ce of the bill is it expressed Congress' intent some years \u2014 THE COURT : Fine. It gave money. What's the big deal? How much of that went to Schedule 1? MR. DOLINGER : That, your Honor, I don't have information about. THE COURT : Mr. Dolinger, that argument is not getting anywhere. App. 114a MR. DOLINGER : Understood, your Honor. THE COURT : Stick with 1970 and the process after that. MR. DOLINGER : As of 1970, Congress made a list of rationales for the law, principally among which were these public health and safety concern s. THE COURT : And it created five schedules. MR. DOLINGER : That's correct. THE COURT : Teach me the importance of the schedules. MR. DOLINGER : And placed marijuana on schedule 1. The schedules are arrayed from 1 through 5 in terms of the amount of control that the law places on each substance. THE COURT : What's the difference among the different schedules? MR. DOLINGER : The only schedule that's relevant here is schedule 1, which requires that \u2014 THE COURT : My mind goes beyond what's focused and relevant. What do the other schedules do? MR. DOLINGER : The other schedules also provide for the control of controlled substances that are known to have som e currently accepted medical use. THE COURT : What would be the consequence, for example, if marijuana was shifted from schedule 1 to schedule 2? MR. DOLINGER : The consequence would be that it could be recognized to have some accepted medical use if it were shifted. App. 115a THE COURT : Would it still be criminal? MR. DOLINGER : There would be criminal penalties attached to the illegal distribution. THE COURT : Resulting in custody. MR. DOLINGER : Yes. Among other substances on schedule 2 are certain opiates and amphetamines. THE COURT : The scourge that's now going on would be a schedule 2 scourge. MR. DOLINGER : There are drugs on schedule 2 that are part of the current opioid crisis, your Honor. Yes, that's correct. THE COURT : What happens if marijuana went to schedule 3? What would be the consequence? MR. DOLINGER : All of these schedules have potential consequences for illegal distribution and use, your Honor. THE COURT : Even if it were on schedule 5, the most lenient of the schedules, would there be criminal consequences? MR. DOLINGER : For illicit use, your Honor, and distribution, that is my understanding, but I would respectfully request to get back to the Court on this. THE COURT : What's the answer to that question, Mr. Hiller? MR. HILLER : Not necessarily, you r Honor. For example, Robitussin is a schedule 5 drug. That's not an illicit drug. There are other drugs which are prescription. App. 116a THE COURT : If you periled Robitussin because of the contents of the cough medicine, it could be illegal, right? MR. HILLER : Yes, it could. THE COURT : Even though it's an off -the-shelf drug? MR. HILLER : That's my understanding, Judge. THE COURT : Off the record. (Discussion off the record) THE COURT : Mr. Hiller, even if it was on schedule 5 there would be circumstances where selling, distributing an item on schedule 5 could be criminal. MR. HILLER : It could be, yes. There are circumstances. THE COURT : Thank you, Mr. Hiller. MR. HILLER : Sure. MR. DOLIN GER : As your Honor pointed out, there is a scheduling process that the DEA follows by delegation from the Attorney General to account for developments in science and medicine \u2014 THE COURT : Let's say I'm a doctor specializing or wanting to specialize in the a dministration of marijuana for certain medical purposes, and we recognize that there are now medical purposes that can be useful to be treated with marijuana, at least to remedy the problem of pain. How would that doctor go about getting a reclassification ? MR. DOLINGER : Any person can submit a petition to the DEA seeking a rescheduling of a drug and can submit evidence that they assert supports the rescheduling. In making the scheduling decision App. 117a the DEA seeks a recommendation from the Secretary of Health a nd Human Services. THE COURT : Is there some kind of a trial? MR. DOLINGER : There is an agency review process that does result in an agency decision. There is an extensive record. THE COURT : Is a record created? MR. DOLINGER : A record is created and is subj ect to review in the courts of appeal. THE COURT : Can the petitioner bring evidence? MR. DOLINGER : Yes. The petitioner can submit evidence. THE COURT : So the petitioner is free to bring in all kinds of evidence supporting his claim that there should be a liberalization of the scheduling of marijuana? MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. And that is the forum in which \u2014 THE COURT : Then there is a proce ss and a final determination by the agency. MR. DOLINGER : Correct, your Honor. THE COURT : Or under the Administrative Procedure Act, there is a review by the D.C. Court of Appeals. MR. DOLINGER : There is actually a specific statutory provision under the Co ntrolled Substances Act that provides for review in any of the courts of appeals. But the D.C. circuit has reviewed these rescheduling decisions several times. App. 118a THE COURT : As in any administrative agency cases, the petitioner is free to ask the Court of App eals the jurisdiction where he lives to review the final determination of the agency. MR. DOLINGER : Yes, a petitioner may. THE COURT : And then there is ultimate review in the Supreme Court. MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : If the agency doesn't do its duty, a writ of mandamus can be taken out in an appropriate Court of Appeals. MR. DOLINGER : That's true as well. THE COURT : It's just like any other situation in any agency? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. With the specific statutory guidelines that the agency must follow in rescheduling decisions. THE COURT : Like all other administrative agencies, there are legal criteria that must be observed? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : Indeed there have been such proceed - ings. MR. DOLINGER : There have been a number of those proceedings. THE COURT : Was it part of your argument to tell me about it? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : Now would be a good time. App. 119a MR. DOLINGER : This is addre ssed in our brief and that is one of the grounds on which we have moved to dismiss. There is this possibility of administrative review that the plaintiffs have not sought to take advantage of here. THE COURT : They tell me it's futile. MR. DOLINGER : Yes, yo ur Honor. THE COURT : Meaning that a lot of people have lost. MR. DOLINGER : That is correct, your Honor. THE COURT : Then it takes a long time for the agency to work. MR. DOLINGER : These petitions have been unsuc cess- ful in the past. But the last two decisi ons in 2011 and 2016 denying the scheduling of marijuana found that there were not sufficient studies of sufficiently high quality to show the efficacy of marijuana. THE COURT : Those aren't decisions by the D.C. Court of Appeals. MR. DOLINGER : Those are decisions by the DEA on the rescheduling petitions. One of those cases \u2014 THE COURT : Affirmed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. MR. DOLINGER : Yes. One of them was affir med. The other, no review was taken. Or if a review was taken, it was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. There was a 2013 D.C. Court of Appeals \u2014 THE COURT : The substantive rule of the D.C. Court of Appeals was established in 2013? App. 120a MR. DOLINGER : The D.C. circuit did rule in 2013 and upheld the DEA's refusal to reschedule the drug, as supported by substantial evidence. THE COURT : And the record that came up in 2013 was dated when? MR. DOLINGER : That was the 2011 denial, your Honor. THE COURT : In 2011, six, seven years ago, the DEA, after an administrative hearing and evidence and the like, ruled that marijuana should remain schedule 1? MR. DOLINGER : Correct, your Honor. THE COURT : And the petiti oner didn't like that rule, so he appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals that the law says he should, and he lost in D.C. Court of Appeals. MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : Although that rule is not binding on me, it's persuasive, isn't it? MR. DOL INGER : It's very persuasive, your Honor. Because in coming to that determination the D.C. circuit applied a much more rigorous standard of review than your Honor would apply under a rational basis for a view to the law. THE COURT : What was the standard rev iew? MR. DOLINGER : It is an APA type standard, your Honor, substantial evidence. THE COURT : Whether there is substantial evidence, what is the determination of the agency? App. 121a MR. DOLINGER : Supports factual findings which reasonably support the legal conclusio n. THE COURT : And the D.C. Court of Appeals found that there was. MR. DOLINGER : That's correct, your Honor. THE COURT : As of 2011. MR. DOLINGER : Yes. In a decision as of 2013. Among other things, your Honor \u2014 THE COURT : Plaintiff can go back now and say, things have changed since 2011. Here are all these medical uses and here are all these doctors' testimonials about how much it is used and here are my clients, and you have the people who have been helped considerably by it, please change your mind. MR. DOLI NGER : Exactly, your Honor. The admin - istrative review process is the appropriate way to present new evidence to the DEA concerning allegations that there are scientific and medical changes or advancements that could \u2014 THE COURT : What is the doctrine of law that so specifies? MR. DOLINGER : I'm sorry, your Honor? THE COURT : What is the doctrine of law that would allow me to dismiss the case, as you want me to do, on the ground that the proper remedy is in the DEA and in the Court of Appeals? MR. DOLINGER : It's the doctrine of administrative exhaustion, your Honor. Where there is an available and adequate administrative remedy, a court should not first hear a challenge before that App. 122a administrative review process has been exhausted. Here, the plaintiffs \u2014 THE COURT : What does available mean? Admin - istrative and available legal remedy? MR. DOLINGER : It means that the process must provide an opportunity for the relief that the plaintiffs are seeking. THE COURT : Suppose they just sit on their butts. MR. DOLINGER : A writ of mandamus, as your Honor stated, can be taken to a Court of Appeals seeking to direct the agency to act if agency action has been unduly delayed. THE COURT : Plaintiffs say that there was a seven and a half years' delay. Do I remember correctly? How many years, Mr. Hiller? MR. HILLER : It's nine, your Honor. THE COURT : Nine years' delay. MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, the agency. THE COURT : Is anyone taking a writ in the D.C. Court of Appeals and say, that's unconscionable? MR. DOLINGER : I understand ther e may have been mandamus writs taken in the past in these cases, your Honor. The most two recent rescheduling petitions were pending for a shorter period than that, for, I believe, five to six years, but the agency process is exhaustive. It results in the compilation of a record that is hundreds of pages long. As I stated, the DEA takes a recommendation from the secretary of HHS who delegates that responsi - bility to the Food and Drug Administration, which App. 123a makes scie ntific findings that are binding on DEA. That process necessarily takes time and provides for this exhaustive record that is then available to the Court of Appeals for administrative review. THE COURT : Is there anything now pending before the DEA? MR. DOLI NGER : Not to my understanding, your Honor. There was this petition that was denied in 2016. Any party who is aggrieved by a DEA decision of that type can take the appeal. But, as I stated, no proper appeal was perfected from that 2016 decision. THE COURT : I think I understand exhaustion. Let's move on to another point, unless I missed something that you want to tell me about. MR. DOLINGER : No, your Honor. Just that ruling on exhaustion would dispose of all of the claims in this case. THE COURT : Including th e constitutional claims? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. Because what plaintiffs are seeking here is only a challenge to the scheduling of marijuana on schedule 1. THE COURT : By act of Congress. MR. DOLINGER : By act of Congress. And if the drug were resched uled to another schedule, presumably they would be getting all of the relief they are seeking because they do not assert that marijuana cannot be scheduled on any of the other schedules. Actually, the Second Circuit ruled on that point. THE COURT : In Kiffe r. MR. DOLINGER : In Kiffer . That's right, your Honor. App. 124a THE COURT : What year was Kiffer ? MR. DOLINGER : 1973. The case was cited with approval in 2013 in U.S. v. Canori , also a Second Circuit case, but held as \u2014 THE COURT : Spell that last name. MR. DOLINGER : C-a-n-o-r-i. Cited in our brief, your Honor. THE COURT : Why do you expose the fact that I don't remember it? MR. DOLINGER : Just for reference, your Honor. THE COURT : What year was Canori ? MR. DOLINGER : 2013. THE COURT : It was a summary disposition, summary order? MR. DOLINGER : I know it was an opinion, I believe, by Judge Cabranes. THE COURT : You have two precedents that say that the district court in the Southern District of New York and other parts governed by the Sec ond Circuit cannot take up the proposition that the act is unconstitutional. MR. DOLINGER : Kiffer did hold that the scheduling of marijuana as scheduled by Congress in 1970 was constitutionally rational and Canori \u2014 THE COURT : It affirmed the conviction for violation of the narcotics laws in the distribution of marijuana, right? MR. DOLINGER : It did not reopen the question. Yes, your Honor. App. 125a THE COURT : And the defense argument was that the law is unconstitutional, right? MR. DOLINGER : Yes. THE COURT : And the Court held that it is constitu - tional? MR. DOLINGER : Yes. THE COURT : Is that preclusive? MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, these cases remain binding on this court, yes. THE COURT : Meaning it's preclusive? MR. DOLINGER : Yes. THE COURT : Meaning I have no discretion . MR. DOLINGER : That's the government's position, your Honor. THE COURT : Meaning if I rule for the plaintiff I would be reversed. MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, that is our position, yes. THE COURT : More than your position. That's the ruling by the Second Circu it. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. That is the rule of the circuit and of the Supreme Court, that the lower courts do not have the discretion to disobey the binding precedents. THE COURT : I once failed to follow a Second Circuit precedent. I had f ound a Supreme Court precedent that although not directly on point, I thought was persuasive. And so I followed the Supreme Court and my case went to the Supreme Court and the App. 126a Second Circuit was reversed. And in the remand the Second Circuit chastised me f or not following Second Circuit precedence. I suppose I could do that now and get chastised again. Why do you applaud a judge that's going to be chastised? MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, it is the rule that even if there were some interceding precedent from th e Supreme Court, if it is not directly on point and if it does not reverse that Second Circuit case, the Second Circuit case does remain binding on this Court. THE COURT : Seems to me that I'm bound by Kiffer and Canori . MR. DOLINGER : We agree, your Honor. THE COURT : What else do you want to tell me that's bad news for the plaintiff? MR. DOLINGER : Most of the other claims, your Honor, have also been rejected. First, I'll deal with the commerce clause claim. That one was not rejected only by the Second Circuit, but also by the Supreme Court itself in Gonzalez v. Raich . THE COURT : What's the argument? MR. DOLINGER : The plaintiffs' argument, as I under - stand it, is, if there is solely intrastate distribution or use of marijuana, that is not a proper subject for a federal regulation under the commerce clause. THE COURT : What's the case? Ogden v. something or other est ablished in 1938. App. 127a MR. DOLINGER : Wickard v. Filburn is the precedent that the Supreme Court ultimately relied on in Raich to hold that economic effects of a law can be aggregated \u2014 THE COURT : Where does the distribution in a par - ticular state, since it's qui te likely that the drug can come from a different state, or be distributed from a different state, interstate commerce exists and there is jurisdiction on the part of Congress to act. It's like in a Hobbs Act. If someone sells fruits and vegetables in a bo dega and is held up, the guy holding him up is subject to enhanced penalties because he is violating the Hobbs Act. Even though there is an argument that the transaction is purely local, the bodega operates on a particular street corner, their argument doe sn't prevail because of interstate. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. The effect on interstate commerce can be minimal. THE COURT : You are teaching me that the commerce argument is not a valid argument. MR. DOLINGER : It is foreclosed. THE COURT : What else would you like to teach me? I'm sorry that I'm disturbing your set argument. You probably prepared for two days and two nights on a sequence of argument and here the judge is interrupting every minute. MR. DOLINGER : We welcome your questions, your Honor. THE COURT : You do not. App. 128a MR. DOLINGER : There are implications in the plain tiffs' papers concerning a fundamental right either to use marijuana or to access the medication of one's choice. Those arguments have also been rejected by all of the courts that have considered them. The applicable test for whether there is a fundamental right comes from a Supreme Court case from the late 1990s, Washington v. Glucks - berg. It holds that a fundamental right exists only if it is deeply rooted in the nati on's history and traditions and is implicit in the concept of overt liberty. All of the cases that have considered whether there is either a specific right to marijuana under the fundamental rights jurisprudence or, more gener - ally, to access medications of one's choice, if they are not approved under the regulatory regime \u2014 THE COURT : By implication, that's the rule of Kiffer . MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, Kiffer did not specifically address fundamental \u2014 THE COURT : I said by implication. MR. DOLINGER : That's r ight, your Honor. THE COURT : If it were a fundamental right to distribute marijuana, Kiffer would not have been \u2014 MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. And the Court there did hold that there is no fundamental right to distribute marijuana. It did not add ress whether there is a fundamental right to use. But subsequent cases have addressed that point and have concluded that there isn't. App. 129a THE COURT : What else would you like to teach me? MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor \u2014 THE COURT : I think you have hit on all of the high points. MR. DOLINGER : Also, if you have further questions. We are happy to rest on our brief. THE COURT : Anything else in your brief that you want to draw to my attention? Your brief is very long. MR. DOLINGER : Yes. The briefing is lengthy, your Honor. THE COURT : I read these at night, so my attention span is very limited, even during the olympics. MR. DOLINGER : Very briefly, your Honor, there are claims concerning the constitutional right to travel in the First Amen dment. THE COURT : Those are fundamental rights. MR. DOLINGER : Those are fundamental rights. But the Controlled Substances Act regulates only possession of substances. It does not speak to travel. It does not speak to expression. So under the governing precedence there, too, there is no constitutional claim. THE COUR T: If I wanted to hold up a bodega in New Jersey, I couldn't claim that I'm not allowed to travel to New Jersey. My fundamental right to travel is violated. I wouldn't be able to argue that. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. App. 130a THE COURT : If it's legiti mately a crime, your right to travel for purposes of having the drug for distribution trumps the fundamental right. MR. DOLINGER : Correct, your Honor. THE COURT : However, if you just possessed the marijuana to use it medicinally, without intending to distr ibute it, it's a federal crime. MR. DOLINGER : Federal law does prohibit marijuana and makes it contraband for all purposes as a general matter. THE COURT : But the law is it's possession with intent to distribute. MR. DOLINGER : Distribution is treated diffe rently than simple possession, your Honor, but both are illegal. THE COURT : Simple possession is a misdemeanor? MR. DOLINGER : That, your Honor, I would also have to provide you something further on. MR. BONDY : Yes, your Honor, it's a misdemeanor. MR. DOLIN GER : Unless the Court has any questions. THE COURT : I never had in 19 years a case of simple possession. I've had cases of distribution. MR. DOLINGER : I understand that it is \u2014 THE COURT : If someone is using marijuana or carries it, even for medicinal purpo ses, that person is exposed to being arrested and tried for a misde - meanor. MR. DOLINGER : It is regulated by the Controlled Substances Act, yes, your Honor. App. 131a THE COURT : It depends on whether that Controlled Substances Act is legal. If it's illegal, the trav el is violated. If it's not legal, then you can't travel with it. MR. DOLINGER : These claims do rely on their being some other infirmity in the law. They cannot stand on their own. That's right. THE COURT : Thank you. MR. DOLINGER : Thank you. THE COURT : Mr. Hiller, you want to make a speech or you want to answer questions? MR. HILLER : I think I want to start where your Honor asked your questions so I can address them directly, and maybe I'll get into the speech and maybe I won't. First, with respect to the petitioning process, Mr. Dolinger argues that the petitioning process constitutes a full defense to this action. As far as I know, that argument that Mr. Dolinger has made has been made twice and it's been rejected twice. The first instance was Kiffer , actually was the argument in Kiffer, was that the defendant had no right \u2014 THE COURT : That was a criminal case, Mr. Hiller. The Second Circuit couldn't duck that. An exhaustion would not play a role there because they had to rule on the validity of a conv iction. What would be the consequence if they didn't rule? MR. HILLER : That wasn't the reason that they gave, your Honor. What they said was, in order to get App. 132a to the threshold point of arguing that it's uncon - stitutional, the government came forward and said, you can't argue that because there is a petitioning process and the judge said no. I am going to allow the argument. So even though it was a criminal case, your Honor, I don't think it's distinguishable on that basis. I would also point out that in U.S. v. Pickard , which is one of the lead cases cited by the government, the very argument that Mr. Dolinger made was rejected by the court in U.S. v. Pickard . If I could put my hand on the case, I could actually direct you to the exact page. Here we are. Th e citation is 100 F.Supp. 3rd 981 and it's on page 996. And what the Court said was: A provision conferring jurisdiction to entertain such a constitutional challenge is not required to be included in the CSA itself, nor is the statute insulated from consti tutional review by congres - sional delegation of authority to an agency to consider an administrative petition. The govern - ment has not pointed to any clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to preclude review of constitutional claims regarding the CSA. On that basis, the Court entertained the constitutional claims. I would respectfully submit \u2014 THE COURT : What happened? MR. DOLINGER : In that. MR. HILLER : In that particular case, because the defend ant bears the burden of proving his affirm - ative defense by a preponderance of the evidence App. 133a on a motion to dismiss, he wasn't able to meet that standard. But I would emphasize to this Court that the standard in this case \u2014 THE COURT : It's also a criminal case, right? MR. HILLER : It's also a criminal case, your Honor. But it's cited by the defendants. If the defendants are going to take the position that Pickard defeats our case \u2014 THE COURT : You are talking too fast. I can't think that fast. MR. HILLER : Most of the cases upon which the defendants rely in this matter are criminal defense cases and this is one of them. THE COURT : If I had a criminal case involving distribution and a motion to dismiss were made, I couldn't say that I'm not entertaining that because you have to go through an administrative process that will take years. I have to address it, as Pickard did. I don't think there is an option in the criminal case. You have to deal with it directly. MR. HILLER : There is a three -part test to determine whether or not administrative remedies are futile, your Honor. Even assuming that this Court were not inclined to follow Pickard or Kiffer on this point, we would respectfully submit that the three -part test favors denial of the defend ants' motion with respect to the admin - istrative review process. THE COURT : What are those three parts? App. 134a MR. HILLER : We have to meet just one of them. First, resort to the administrative remedy would cause undue prejudice to a subsequent assertion of a court action due to, for example, an unreason able or indefinite time frame for administrative action. The second is, if there is any doubt that the agency is empowered to grant relief, such as, for example, if the agency lacks the institutional \u2014 THE COURT : Can you slow up, please. MR. HILLER : There is a doubt as to whether the agency was empowered to grant effective relief such as when an agency lacks institutional competence to determine the constitutionality of a statute. THE COURT : That doesn't apply. MR. H ILLER : Third, the administrative body is shown to be biased or otherwise had predetermined the issue before it. I would submit, your Honor, at a minimum, the first and the third fall squarely in our corner, and I would say the second one does as well. If I may just focus on the first. The allegations in the complaint, which, as your Honor is well aware, have to be assumed true for purposes of this motion, are that the petitioning process is a futile one. It takes nine years on average. THE COURT : Only if the argument is plausible. MR. HILLER : Yes, your Honor. But I would respectfully submit it's not only plausible \u2014 App. 135a THE COURT : What is the remedy, if there is an administrative delay? MR. HILLER : Historically what's happened is that petitioners have filed motions for writs of manda - mus to require, for example, the DEA to render a decision. Mr. Holland, who is a co -counsel of ours, he was one of the attorneys on the Americans for Safe Access case, was required to file a motion for a writ of mandamus to require the DEA just to render a decision. It took six years for the DEA just to render a decision before the administrative process continued. THE COURT : What happened on his writ? MR. HILLER : I'm s orry? THE COURT : What happened on the petition for a mandamus? MR. HILLER : Eventually what happened, as I under - stand it, was the DEA responds to the writ of mandamus, actually did issue the decision which then proceeded to go forward. Your Honor, I repre sent people who need cannabis to live. Jagger Cotte was diagnosed with Leigh's disease before he turned the age of two and generally if you are diagnosed before the age of two, you die by the age of four. He was admitted to a hospice before his fourth bir thday, administered cannabis to treat his pain, and he is seven now. I represent Alexis Bortell, who was having multiple seizures a day for 14 months and having repeat App. 136a hospitalizations to the point where her doctor said that part of the left side of her brain might have to be removed, and even then they weren't sure it would work. THE COURT : Is there a process for expedited review by an agency when the pleasures of life and the endurance of life are at stake? MR. HILLER : No, your Honor. THE COURT : Can't I go to an agency and say, please, agency, my client's life is threatened? MR. HILLER : Mr. Holland is gesturing to me and my instinct is that the answer is no. MR. HOLLAND : With regard to Americans with Safe Access, which was also the coalition reschedu led cannabis, a group of scientists, one of the organizations with them was Patients Out of Time, or POT, who are arguing that very thing, that we are suffering immensely without any further action that is expedited in any way. To my knowledge, there has n ever been a way to expedite \u2014 THE COURT : What happened? MR. HOLLAND : Ultimately, it was the mandamus action that brought about the determination from the DEA. THE COURT : Why can't you do that here? MR. HOLLAND : I'm sorry? THE COURT : Why can't you do that he re? MR. HOLLAND : It's not clear that our plaintiffs would be alive at that time. I would defer to Mr. Hiller App. 137a to answer that question directly. But Alexis Bortell, on any given day that she doesn't have access to that, your Honor, she could pass away. THE COURT : She has been doing it. No one has bothered her. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, the real problem with that process - THE COURT : She has fears to move from her juris- diction. Colorado is a safe jurisdiction. She moved to Colorado, I think you alleged, bec ause it was the opportunity to get cannabis at the time when Massachusetts didn't allow it. MR. HILLER : Texas, yes. Your Honor, my client, it's not\u2014 THE COURT : Let's stay with that for a while. I think that's the critical part of your case. MR. HILLER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : You are really arguing that basic issues of human life are at stake. MR. HILLER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : Not just an opportunity for recreational use of marijuana, but the opportunity to enjoy life itself is threatened without marijuana. MR. HILLER : Yes, your Honor. THE COURT : That's circumstance. What would happen if you went to the agency and said, here is my case, I need quick action, I need immediate response? If there was no response, you take out a mandamus to the Court of Appeals. App. 138a MR. HILLER : Your Honor, it is my understanding that petitioners have already been placed in that situation and, nonetheless, the decisions don't come. And the concern that I have, your Honor, quite frankly, is, yes, Alexis Bortell and Jagger Cot te and Jose Belen need their cannabis to live. Alexis Bortell, who has not had a seizure in almost three years, since she started the cannabis, while she is allowed to stay within Colorado, your Honor, I would remind the Court that 28 percent of the United States is federal land. She is excluded between a quarter and a third of American lands from traveling anywhere. THE COURT : If Congress can legislate, then she can't travel. If it can, she has got to abide by the law. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, what I would say to that\u2014 THE COURT : It all depends on the legality. I just put to you that a district court is not the appropriate forum to weigh all of the conflicting arguments with regard to items on the schedules. It's not only that there is a medical use, but it has to be weighed. That criteria has to be weighed against other criteria, including the dangers to the community by too -ready availability of the drug. That has been the holdup, I think, in terms of what Congress is feeling. There is lots of things district judges have to do. When agencies are set up to do the very kind of thing that you want me to do, I think the right thing is to defer to the agency. App. 139a MR. HILLER : Your Honor, what I would suggest to your Honor is, and in the greatest deal of respect, is to review the language in Pickard that I have referred to you because that language \u2014 THE COURT : It's the same issue as Kiffer . Kiffer is a case where the Second Circuit took the case, took the argument , and Pickard did the same thing, ultimately holding that the argument did not have merit. But they took it. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, in each instance the courts allowed the defendants to interpose a constitu - tional challenge and constitutional chal lenge w as deemed not to be precluded by the existence of the petitioning program. The defendants argued there \u2014 THE COURT : The existence of what? MR. HILLER : Of the petitioning program, of the administrative review process. The very arguments that were made today were made in those two cases. And what the courts \u2014 THE COURT : The court held that because there is a petitioning process, the law is not unconstitutional. MR. HILLER : No. I'm sorry, your Honor. What the court did in Pickard and Kiffer was that when the defense came forward with an affirmative defense, arguing that the statute was unconsti tutional, the Federal Government said they are precluded from making any constitutional challenge. THE COURT : And the Court held not, but then they held against the defend ant. App. 140a MR. HILLER : The Court held that they were not precluded from raising the constitutional claim, that the threshold issue that the defense is raising now \u2014 THE COURT : Mr. Hiller, let me suggest. I understand you are passionate about your case, and you've got a very strong case and a lot of human interest involved. Unless you discipline yourself to slow down, you lose your effectiveness. MR. HILLER : Thank you, your Honor. I will do my best. The threshold argument that the defense made today is the sa me threshold argument that was rejected in Pickard . THE COURT : I take your point. I take your point. I have it. I really understand it. I may not follow it, but I understand it. The second part of my question, though, is what I'm focused on. When the dist rict courts and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals focused on the issue, they held that the Constitution was not violated by having marijuana on schedule 1. MR. HILLER : Yes. That goes to the issue of stare decisis , which I am prepared to discuss. THE COUR T: Maybe we should get into that. But I'm thinking that in those cases they held that they had to get onto the question and they gave different reasons than I had. But they got onto the question. They held that the defense was not proved. What did they hol d? App. 141a MR. HILLER : In Kiffer , the claimed constitutional right, as Mr. Dolinger pointed out, was the constitutional right to distribute cannabis, which is clearly not implicated by Alexis Bortell, Jagger Cotte or Jose Belen. THE COURT : Slow. MR. HILLER : With r espect to Canori, Canori 's argument was not constitutional. Mr. Dolinger represented to this Court that Canori was decided on constitutional grounds but, in fact, the defendant in Canori argued that the Ogden memorandum had affected a de facto rescheduling of cannabis and, therefore, he could not be charged as having violated a classification of schedule 1. THE COURT : I don't think he relies on Canori for that purpose. I think he relies on Canori for favorable citation of Kiffer . Am I right, Mr. Dolinger? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. MR. HILLER : With respect to Kiffer , your Honor \u2014 THE COURT : What about Pickard ? MR. HILLER : I'm sorry. THE COURT : What about Pickard ? What was the constitutional ruling of Pickard . MR. HILLER : The argument in Pickard was different from what we are arguing. The argument in Pickard was, the ruling was that the classification was constitutional, but the arguments and claims were different. The arguments we are making App. 142a here are not the same. And I would emphasize to the Cou rt\u2014 THE COURT : What were the arguments in Pickard ? MR. HILLER : In Pickard , there are quite a few of them. THE COURT : Pick out two, the two you have the most difficulty in answering. MR. HILLER : I'm sorry? THE COURT : The two that you have most difficulty in answering. I'll read the case again before I issue my decision. You might as well anticipate that I'll focus on the two questions that you have difficulty in answering. MR. HILLER : The first argument in Kiffer and in Pickard \u2014 THE COURT : Here is the answer. MR. HILLER : No, it's not. The principal claim in Pickard was that science had reached the point where now the scientific community had raised enough questions that cannabis does have a medical application within the meaning of a schedule 1 definition, which is not the same that we are arguing. THE COURT : It really is. MR. HILLER : With all due respect, your Honor, it is definitely not. I can assure you that \u2014 THE COURT : Your clients have a medical need for marijuana that it's saving their lives. MR. HILLER : That's correct. App. 143a THE COURT : Isn't that the same argument? MR. HILLER : Our argument is not that there is this raging scientific debate that has ultimately started to tip in our favor. That is not the argument. Our argument is that the Federal Government knows that cannabis is safe and effective. The reason I would say that \u2014 THE COURT : It doesn't want to act. MR. HILLER : The Federal Government has a patent right now that was taken out by the Department of Health and Human Services which, according to defendants' brief on page 5, specifically says is binding on the Federal Government. Now, in that patent application, the United States Government represented that cannabis constitutes a safe and medically effective treatment for Parkin - son's disease, HIV -induced dementia, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune diseases, and also serves as a neuroprotectant to help people with seizu re disorders. And those representations cannot be made in bad faith by law under Section 101 of Title 35 of the United States Code. Any representation made in a patent application must be in good faith based upon the invention's utility. So the United Stat es Government has represented \u2014 THE COURT : Your clients are living proof of the medical appropriateness of marijuana . I don't need a patent to tell me that. I have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true. How could anyone say that your c lients' lives have not been saved by marijuana? How can anyone say that your clients' pain and suffering App. 144a has not been alleviated by marijuana? You can't, right? MR. HILLER : I could not agree with you more, your Honor. THE COURT : That criteria, does it trum p everything else? Suppose the administrative agency would say, yes, yes, Mr. Hiller, you are right. But the dangers I see in marijuana are such, dangers to the community, are such that I feel and I hold that there is no rescheduling. Can it do that? MR. H ILLER : No. Once cannabis does not meet Sec - tion 2 of the definition, it cannot be classified as a schedule 1 drug. Your Honor, in that sense you have made the point for us. There is no real question that cannabis provides safe or medically effective relie f to our clients. And the fact of the matter is, in order for cannabis to be schedule 1 drug, in addition to having to have no medical application whatsoever, it also has to be so dangerous it can't even be tested under strict medical supervision and, yet, the United States Government is allowing over 200 million Americans today to have access to cannabis in 30 states across the country. In addition to that, your Honor, the government itself has its own investigational new drug pro - gram and beginning in 19 76 has been distrib - uting cannabis to medical patients all over the country for the treatment of their diseases. If cannabis met the requirements of a schedule 1 drug, the Federal Government, under the FDA's regulations, would not have been permitted to include cannabis as a schedule 1 drug. App. 145a THE COURT : Judge Wolford in western New York, United States v. Green , I think looked at it in the way that is persuasive to me. She said : It is difficult to conclude that marijuana is not currently being used for medica l purposes. It is. There would be no rational basis to conclude otherwise. If that were the central question in this case, defendants' argument would have merit, but it is not the central question. The issue is not whether it is rational for Congress or the DEA to conclude that there is no currently accepted medical use for marijuana. That would be the issue if a claim were brought in a circuit court challenging the DEA's administrative determination. Rather, a constitutional issue for equal protection purposes is simply whether there is any conceiv - able basis to support the placement of marijuana in the most stringent schedule under the act. This is 222 F.Supp. 3d, 275 -280. MR. HILLER : What page were you at, your Honor? THE COURT : 275-280. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, I'm familiar with Green. I read it. What I would suggest to the Court is that\u2014 THE COURT : Your argument is that Kiffer really overrules Green or Green is not following Kiffer because Kiffer holds that the district court should retain the issue, and language does not confine it to a criminal court, to a criminal case. MR. HILLER : Yes, your Honor. I would also point out - App. 146a THE COURT : I have your argument. I know the argument. It's a good argument. I'm not saying it's a win argument. It's a good argument. MR. HILLER : I appreciate it, your Honor. THE COURT : I don't know if it's a win argument. That's one of the things I have to decide. MR. HILLER : May I address one other point on the issue of stare decisis before we change the subject? THE COURT : Of course. MR. HILLER : I'll try to do it quickly. THE COURT : Don't do it quickly. MR. HILLER : I won't say it quickly. I'll just try to do it quickly. In United States v. Pickard , one of the arguments that the Federal Government made is another argument that was made here, specifically that the presence of a prior decision by the Ninth Circuit specifically foreclosed any constitutional challenge because in that case, just like, for example, in Kiffer , the Court ruled that the Controlled Substanc es Act, as it pertains to cannabis' classification as a schedule 1 drug, is constitutional. So the government argued then, argued today. The name of that case that Pickard was referring to was Miroyan . And what the Court in Pickard ruled was, the decision in Miroyan does not foreclose a Court's consideration of future constitu - tional challenges to the classification of marijuana as a schedule 1 drug. That case does not stand for App. 147a the proposition that even if defendants proffer credible evidence raising serious questions regard - ing the constitutional soundness of marijuana's listing on schedule 1, that district courts cannot entertain a constitutional challenge. Then the Court in Pickard specifically relied on the decision in Gonzalez v. Raich for the proposi tion that it had no choice but to consider the constitu - tional challenge, notwithstanding defendants' argument. And what the Court said, and I quote, to read Miroyan so broadl y as to preclude constitutional challenges to marijuana scheduling under any circumstances would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court's relatively recent observation in Raich, specifically that evidence proffered by the defendants regarding the effective medical uses for marijuana, if found credible after trial, would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the findings that require marijuana to be listed as a schedule 1 drug. I would also cite for the Court's attention Jeno v. Commissioner of Patents & Tr ademarks , which talks about changes of circumstances warranting a departure from prior decisions. The Court in Jeno said : Nor does the doctrine of stare decisis apply to the present action. Contrary to the defendants' reasoning, there is a strong possibili ty that plaintiff can show changed circumstances. Stare decisis may not be so mechanically applied so as to ignore changing facts and inequitable results. App. 148a And a case that opposing counsel cited, Gately v. Massachusetts , held, as stare decisis is concerned with rules of law, a decision dependent upon its underlying facts is not necessarily controlling precedent as to a subsequent analysis of the same question on different facts and on a different record, which is exactly what we are saying here. Although Mr. Dolinger pointed out in his brief that Gately is a First Circuit case, Gately also cites a Second Circuit decision, In Re Tug Helen B. Moran, Inc. , 607 F.2d 1029 (2d Cir. 1979). This is the Second Circuit. We find no merit in the state's attem pt to invoke the doctrine of stare decisis since the doctrine is not applicable to determinations of fact. In view of the fact that stare decisis is concerned with rules of law, a decision dependent on the facts is not controlling precedent as to a subseq uent determination of the same question on different facts and on a different record. THE COURT : What is the determination of fact? Who determined it? MR. HILLER : Your Honor would determine the facts. There is no jury in this case because we are asking for equitable relief. THE COURT : But issue is not a factual issue. It's a motion to dismiss a complaint as a matter of law. MR. HILLER : I agree. THE COURT : The issue that the government raises is that since Congress had a rational basis to have the law in 197 0 instead of a procedure for change, App. 149a the law is constitutional. That's as far as the argument goes. The question I would pose as a judge hearing it might go a little further. It might say that even though there was a rational basis for the law when it was promulgated, the inability or unwill ingness of the agency to act on changing facts indicates that there is some kind of unconstitutionality. I don't know how to complete that argument. I think that is really your argument. MR. HILLER : It is, your Honor. It's one of them. THE COURT : The next question is, you asked for a reclassification. What would happen with a reclas - sification ? MR. HILLER : We are not asking for reclassification, your Honor. We are simply asking for a declaration that the classificatio n of cannabis as a schedule 1 drug under the CSA is unconstitutional. THE COURT : That would not give you complete relief. There are other schedules that might go into this. The implication of that argument, it should not be schedule 1 ; it might be schedule something else. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, it is my understanding \u2014 THE COURT : The relief you are asking is not to remove marijuana from any and all schedules, because that would fit the argument you are making. MR. HILLER : Our argument, your Honor, is that once this Court finds that the classification, if the Court were to find tha t the classification violates App. 150a the Constitution, it would be the schedule and it would be incumbent upon Congress to pass new legislation to reschedule it to another level. THE COURT : If I review what your complaint is I have to focus on 1970. MR. HILLER : Yes. THE COURT : And I can't focus on 1970 and give you relief. I can only focus on the as -applied attitude that the Attorney General or his delegee has not been keeping current. That's a different argument and I don't know the answer to it. MR. HILLER : What I would say, your Honor, is that the Court is duty bound to look at 1970, but also look at the changing facts and circumstances that have occurred since 1970. THE COURT : It's not a basis for a rational basis test for the law passed in 1970. MR. HILLE R: Your Honor, we have cited cases that take a different position on that issue than you have. The cases that we have cited make very clear that changed circumstances can be considered and factored into a rational relation or rational review analysis. Your Honor, as long as we are talking about 1970, I think it's important not to lose sight of one critical fact about our case, which also must be assumed true for purposes of this motion, and that is, your Honor, that the Controlled Substances Act was enacte d not for the purpose of preserving health and lives, but, instead, to suppress political rights of those that Richard Nixon and his admin istration believed to be hostile to his App. 151a administration and, also, to oppress African Americans. We have four witness es who have each stated that the Controlled Substances Act, which was passed, your Honor, in 27 days, and written entirely by the Attorney General at the time, John Mitchell, who went to prison afterwards, not related to the\u2014 THE COURT : Mr. Hiller, what's the point? The point is, I'm not involved here in a discussion of the evaluation of the Nixon administration. I'm not here to evaluate the good faith or not of the Attorney General in drafting this law. There are other very important laws that were passed in the twinkling of an eye, including the Securities Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933, the law on setting up the courts and the special master after 9/11. Don't argue with me that it came very fast. Here is the argument I'm interested in. You can' t win on these arguments. You may have appeal on those arguments, but you can't win on those arguments. Schedule 1 requires that a drug must have a high potential for abuse ; no currently accepted medical use and treatment in the United States ; third, there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision. You win on two. One, I don't know. If these are three criteria that have to be weighed, a district judge would have a very hard job in weighing medical use ag ainst potential for abuse. I think bias and prejudice would be a danger. App. 152a The third criteria, lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision, the opioid epidemic has occurred in a prescription drug. Who was there t o say that a requirement of a prescription for marijuana will save the community from the danger of the drug? My point is this. I don't know if these are conjunctive criteria that all have to be satisfied or disjunctive criteria. But my experience with criteria is that they have to be weighed and evaluated. If as a matter of law I'm wrong on that, I would like you to tell me. MR. HILLER : Your Honor, as a matter of law, you are wrong on that one, I'm sorry. All three have to be met. I don't think the govern ment is going to tell you differently. I don't believe there is any weighing process \u2014 THE COURT : Are you going to tell me differently, Mr. Dolinger? MR. DOLINGER : No, your Honor. That is true for the DEA. As your Honor cited, United States v. Green holds t hat that's not the proper analysis for a district court. THE COURT : I'll hear you in a minute. I think Mr. Hiller is drawing to a close. MR. HILLER : Absolutely, Judge. I want to point to two more points, if I may. The first is, I respect that the Court d oesn't want to get involved in the inner machinations of the Nixon administration, but I would respectfully urge the Court to review footnote 45 to our brief App. 153a on page 47. Because even if the defendants are given the benefit of the doubt and they are entitle d to argue their rational and review, even under those circumstances, if there is a basis to infer antipathy or bad faith in the enactment or passage of a statute, then, your Honor, those factors are actually very relevant. And if it's also true that the rational basis, the so - called rational basis is merely a subterfuge for something more sinister, your Honor, I would respectfully submit that if we could prove those facts, if we could prove that the Nixon admin - istration, or those that were working for it, were involved in a predatory effort to break up protests and infiltrate opposition groups, your Honor, then the Controlled Substances Act doesn't get rationality review. THE COURT : As a judge I will not get int o that. It's a political question. I will not get into it. The law is the law. I'm sworn to enforce the laws. If it's constitutional, I uphold it. Constitutionality will not depend on what may have been in President Nixon's mind at the time or in Attorney General Mitchell's mind at the time, or in all the legislators' minds at the time. This bill passed by votes. MR. HILLER : It's not my practice \u2014 THE COURT : Passed the house, passed the Senate, signed by the president. It's either constitutional or not and I will follow those arguments. What's the last point? MR. HILLER : I think I want to make that my last point. App. 154a THE COURT : Thank you very much, Mr. Hiller. You raised provocative questions. MR. HILLER : Thank you. THE COURT : Mr. Dolinger, last few words. We will wrap up the argument and I will reserve decision. MR. DOLINGER : Just a few points very briefly, your Honor. The first on the question of the administrative remedy, it is true that Kiffer looked past the administrativ e remedy and ruled on the consti - tutional question. That is because it cited two rationales for that. The first was that it was a criminal case, as your Honor pointed out. THE COURT : Mr. Hiller told me it was not one of the rationales. MR. DOLINGER : Your H onor, it was, in fact, one of the rationales that it was a pending criminal case. THE COURT : Was it explicitly a rationale? MR. DOLINGER : Yes, your Honor. I can get you a page cite, if that would be helpful. THE COURT : Here is the wording. I think Mr. Do - linger is right. 477, F.2d at 352. MR. HILLER : Are we talking about Canori or Kiffer ? THE COURT : Kiffer . MR. HILLER : Let me just pull it out. THE COURT : Got it? MR. HILLER : I don't have it yet, your Honor. I'm sorry. THE COURT : I'll wait for you. App. 155a Page 352. MR. HILLER : I'm sorry? THE COURT : Page 352. Right at the top. You see where it says second? Second, even assuming the existence of a viable administrative remedy, application of the exhaustion doctrine in criminal cases is ge nerally not favored because of the severe burden it imposes on defendants. MR. DOLINGER : Thank you, your Honor. The other rationale cited by the Second Circuit was the position of the head of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which is the prede cessor to the DEA as of 1973, which is that he had a concurrent obligation under a drug regulation treaty that also had the force of statute. That position is no longer \u2014 THE COURT : Give me that again. I missed it. MR. DOLINGER : The head of the Bureau of Na rcotics and Dangerous Drugs came to the conclusion at the time that rescheduling marijuana was separately prohibited to him as part of the administrative process by a treaty obligation. The DEA does not take that position and has considered a number of pet itions to reschedule marijuana since that time. THE COURT : None of which has succeeded. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. THE COURT : Let me ask you this. Go back to these three criteria established by 21 U.S.C. Section 812(b)(1). High potential for a buse, no currently App. 156a accepted medical use, lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Let's say that only criterion 2 is no longer applic - able, but 1 and 3 are. Does that mean it cannot be on schedule 1? MR. DOLINGER : If the DEA is considering a reschedul - ing petition, it is a conjunctive test, so all three factors must be met. THE COURT : What happens if two out of the three are met? Does it hit another schedule? MR. DOLINGER : It may be rescheduled at that point into schedule 2. The DEA did conclude \u2014 THE COURT : If that were the case, plaintiff can win on schedule 1, maybe not here, but in the admin - istrative process, only to find it comes onto schedule 2 or 3. MR. DOLINGER : That's right, your Honor. THE COURT : With lesser penalties but nevertheless criminal penalties. MR. DOLINGER : And among the factors that the DEA considered in making th e determination that it has no currently accepted medical use, this is different from the question of whether there could possibly be any medical utility to the drug. Among other things \u2014 THE COURT : You can't argue that. Given the allega - tion in the complai nt that it saved the life and eliminated epileptic seizures, how can you say that? You have to accept these allegations as true. I can't say they are not plausible. App. 157a MR. DOLINGER : We do accept them as true for purposes of the motion. The issue is that the agency must also consider whether there are sufficient studies of the drug and sufficient studies of high enough quality to show its effectiveness such that it can be permitted \u2014 THE COURT : It says no currently accepted medical use and treatment in the Unite d States. Judge Wolford has said, and what I understand to be the case, that there is. It may not be universal, but some statements in their legislative findings have found that there is accepted medical use. You can't say what you are arguing. Your argume nt doesn't hold. MR. DOLINGER : Your Honor, I understand \u2014 THE COURT : I think the argument is, Mr. Dolinger, if this were an administrative process I might hold, if I were the agency head, that, no, it's not a schedule 1 drug, but it is a schedule 2 or schedule 3 drug. So nobody has argued the sched ules. But I look at them because it's judicial notice. Therefore, we will reschedule it. The relief that's sought by the plaintiff to travel and to petition Congress and the like won't be changed in the slightest by that reclassification. What they are fearing now they can fear l ater. I think that's the critical issue. Thank you very much. Thank you both sides. Thank you all for attending and being so patient and laughing at my jokes. I'll take this under advisement. MR. DOLINGER : Thank you, your Honor. App. 158a MR. HILLER : Your Honor, ma y we afforded the opportunity for supplemental briefing? THE COURT : No, no supplemental briefs. MR. HILLER : Thank you, your Honor. App. 159a AMENDED COMPLAINT (SEPTEMBER 6, 2017) UNITED STATES DIS TRICT COURT SOUTHERN DIS TRICT OF NEW YORK ________________________ MARVIN WASHINGTON, DEAN BORTELL, as Parent of Infant ALEXIS BORTELL, JOSE BELEN, SEBASTIEN INC., Plain tiffs. v. WILLIA M PELHAM BARR, in His Official Capacity as United States Attor ney General, UNITED STATES DEPART MENT OF JUSTICE UTTAM DHILLON, in His Official Capacity as the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforce ment Admin istration, UNITED STATES DRUG ENFORCE MENT ADMIN ISTRA TION, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Defend ants. ________________________ No. 17 Civ. 5625 PLAIN TIFFS MARVIN WASHINGTON, DEAN ALEXIS BORTELL, JOSE as ASSO CIATION, INC. (collectively, \"Plain tiffs\"), as and for their Amended Complaint against defend ants (\"Defend ants\"), allege as follows : PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This action is brought on behalf of two young children, their fathers, an Amer ican military veteran, a retired pro fessional football player and a non -profit membership organ ization, all of whom have suffered harm, and who are continuously threatened with additional harm, by reason of the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et. seq. The CSA has wrongfully and un constitutionally criminalized the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of Cannabis (comprised of Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica, and Cannabis Ruderalis ), which, historically, has been harvested to produce, among other things, medicine, industrial hemp, and a sub - stance known as tetrahydrocannabinol (\"THC\"). 1 2. Although not styled as a class action, this lawsuit stands to benefit tens of millions of Amer icans who re quire, but are unable to safely obtain (and in far too many instances, unable to obtain at all, safely or not), Cannabis for the treat ment of their illnesses, diseases and med ical conditions, the successful treatment of which is dependent upon its curative pro- perties. 2 In addi tion, this lawsuit, if successful, 1 Robert Deitch, HEMP-AMER ICAN HISTORY REVISITED : THE PLANT WITH A DIVIDED HISTORY 3 (2003) ; Editors of the in this Com plaint, refers to whole -plant Cannabis, with its fu ll spectrum of cannabinoids, including THC, App. 161a would aid in the restoration of communities hardest hit and most egregiously stigmatized by the Fed eral Government's misguided, Crusades -like \"W ar on Drugs.\" 3. As shown below, despite the relatively recent and inappro priate stigmatization of Cannabis in the United States as a supposed \"gateway drug\" used primarily used by \"hippies\" and minorities, there is a long and rich history, dating back t housands of years, of people from virtually every part of the world using Cannabis for med ical, industrial, spiritual, and recrea - tional purposes. 3 Indeed, those who have culti vated, encouraged the cultivation of, and/or used Cannabis include, inter cilia , George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison, James Monroe, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama \u2014an assortment of the most intelligent and accomplished statesmen in Amer ican history. 4. As fur ther shown below, the criminalization of Cannabis \u2014a drug that has never killed anyone \u2014 arose out of the enactment of legislation underwritten by illegal racial and ethnic animus, and imple mented and enforced at the fed eral level by those who choose which is separately mis -classified as a Schedule I drug. 21 C.F.R 1308(d)(31). 3 Deitch, supra note 1 at 1 ; History of Marijuana as Medicine - 2900 BC to [hereinafter referred to as \" PROCON.ORG\"] ; Lecia Bushak, A Brief History of Med ical Cannabis : From Ancient Anesthesia to the Modern Dispensary, MEDICAL DAILY (Jan. 21, as \" MEDICAL DAILY\"]. App. 162a to dis regard its scientific properties and benefits, and/or have been motivated by hatred and outright bigotry. 4 5. The consequences of the Fed eral Gov ernment's misguided War on Drugs have been disastrous. Persons of color are four times as likely as white Amer icans to be inves tigated, charged, prosecuted and incarcerated for possession and/or use of Cannabis, even though it is used in approx imately equal pr oportions among the races. In addi tion, those who are administered medi- cal Cannabis for the treat ment of illnesses, disease and other health -related conditions, have been re - quired to forfeit their First, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amend ment Rights, plus their fun damental right to travel. OVERVIEW OF THE CLAIMS 6. Plain tiffs seek a dec laration that the CSA, as it pertains to the classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, is un constitutional, because it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment, an assortment of pro tections guaranteed by the First, Ninth and Tenth Amend ments, plus the fun damental Right to Travel, the right to Equal Pro tection, and right to Sub stantive Due Process. Fur ther, Plain tiffs seek a dec laration that Con gress, in enacting the CSA 4 Notably, al though a powerful and vocal minority of public officials have con tinued their irrational oppo sition to rescheduling or de -scheduling of Cannabis, the overwhelming majority of Amer icans desire a change. Accord ing to an April 20, 2017 Quinnipiac Poll, nearly 94% of Amer icans sup port legalization of medical marijuana. And 60% of Amer icans sup port full legalization and decriminalization of Cannabis for all pur poses (Exh. 1). App. 163a as it pertains to Cannabis, violated the Commerce Clause, extending the breadth of legis lative power well beyond the scope contemplated by Article I of the Constitution. 5 The claims are as follows : 7. First , as shown below, the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment to the United States Con stitution because the CSA is so irrational as a matter of law that it cannot be said to be rationally related to any legitimate gov ernment pur pose. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug under the CSA, along with such psychotropic drugs as heroin, mescaline and LSD. To have been assigned this Schedule I classification, the Federal Gov ernment was re quired to h ave deter mined that Cannabis : (i) has a high potential for abuse ; (ii) has abso lutely no med ical use in treat ment ; and (iii) cannot be used or tested safely, even under strict med- ical supervision (\"Three Schedule I Require ments\"). Significantly, how ever, as also shown below, the Fed - eral Gov ernment does not believe, and upon infor ma- tion and belief, never has believed, that Cannabis meets or ever met the Three Schedule I Require ments. 8. Under Fed eral Law, it is not enough f or a gov - ernment, in arguing in favor of a statute's constitu- tionality, merely to manufacture a supposedly \"legiti- mate gov ernment interest\" to which a law is rationally related for the pur pose of responding to a lawsuit ; the government must also act ually believe its own argu - ment. And, as shown below, the Fed eral Gov ernment, at a min imum, does not, and cannot possibly, believe 5 In interposing this par ticular claim, Plain tiffs explicitly seek the overturn of the Supreme Court's deci sion in Gonzalez v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). App. 164a that there is no accept able med ical use for Cannabis or that it cannot be used or tested safely under med i- cal supervision. In other words, the Fed eral Gov ern- ment has recog nized that Cannabis does not meet (or come close to meeting) two of the Three Schedule I Require ments. Indeed, the Fed eral Gov ernment has admit ted repeatedly in writing, and implemented national policy reflecting, that Cannabis does, in fact, have med ical uses and can be used and tested safely under med ical supervision. On that basis, the Fed eral Government has exploited Cannabis economically for more than a decade by securing a med ical cannabis patent and entering into license agreements with medical licensees . The Fed eral Government has also been dispensing med ical Cannabis to Amer icans through a certain Inves tigational New Drug Program since the late 1970s for the treat ment of an assortment of diseases. The notion that the Federal Government genuinely believes that Cannabis has no medical appli cation and is so dangerous that, as with heroin, it cannot be tested even under strict med ical supervision, is so absurd that it must be rejected as a matter of law. The Fed eral Gov ernment does not believe in the factual prerequisites underlying its own statute. 9. Because the Fed eral Gov ernment does not believe the factual predicate underl ying its own argu - ments in sup port of the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis, the CSA is irrational and thus un constitu- tional (First Cause of Action). 10. Second , as shown below, the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis was enacted and sub sequent ly imple mented, not to control the spread of a dangerous drug, but rather to suppress the rights and interests App. 165a of those whom the Nixon Admin istration wrongly regarded as hostile to the interests of the United States \u2014African Amer icans and protesters of t he Vietnam War. In par ticular, members of the Nixon Admin istration have confirmed that, when the CSA was enacted, President Nixon regarded those who opposed the Vietnam War as a threat to America's Cold War against Communism. And President Nixon and associates in the Nixon Admin istration, including and especially, Myles Ambrose (America's First Drug Czar), harbored considerable antipathy towards African Amer icans. 11. The Nixon Admin istration recog nized that African Amer icans could not b e arrested on racial grounds, and war protesters could not be prosecuted for opposing America's involve ment in Vietnam. However, the members of the Nixon Admin istration decided that Cannabis was the drug of choice for these two groups. Consequent ly, the Nixon Admin istration ushered the CSA through Con gress and insisted that Cannabis be included on Schedule I so that African Amer icans and war protesters could be raided, prosec uted and incarcerated without identifying the actual and uncon - stitutional basis for the gov ernment's actions. 12. Unfortunately, the Fed eral Gov ernment has been quite successful in using the CSA to harass, intimidate and incarcerate African Amer icans in disproportionate numbers over the years, ruining the lives of generations of black men and women and other persons of color. War protesters were similarly subjected to un constitutional enforce ment activity by the Fed eral Gov ernment, result ing in con victions that stained reputations and limited the career options of countless politically active Amer icans. In so doing, the App. 166a Federal Gov ernment violated (and con tinues to violate) the First Amend ment and the Equal Pro tection Clause as implied by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment to the United States Con stitution (Second Cause of Action). 13. Third , as shown below, the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis violates the con stitutional Right to Travel. As of this writing, 29 States plus Washington, DC and U.S. Territories have legalized the use of Cannabis con- taining high concentrations of THC for the treat ment of scores of illnesses, diseases and conditions. Indeed, more than 62% o f Amer icans currently live in States in which Cannabis with high concentrations of THC may be re commended by phy sicians for med ical treat - ment. 14. Some patients who live in State -legal med ical- Cannabis juris dictions are, for the moment, able, as a practical matter, to avail them selves of med ical Cannabis, not withstand ing the provisions of the CSA, based upon a series of fed eral initiatives which have created tem porary, de facto impediments to its enforce - ment at the fed eral level. How ever, those tem porary federal initiatives do not have the force of law and, in many instances, explicitly state that they do not pro- vide a legal defense to pros ecutions under the CSA. 15. Thus, those who cultivate, distribute, sell, re- commend and/or use med ical Cannabis in conformity with State -legal med ical Cannabis programs remain vulnerable to fed eral enforce ment. 16. Worse, those patients who rely upon med ical Cannabis, even in State -legal med ical-Cannabis juris - dictions, cannot safely travel by airplane ; cannot travel onto fed eral lands or into fed eral buildings App. 167a (even if those fed eral lands and buildings are situated within State -legal med ical-Cannabis juris dictions) ; cannot enter facilities owned by the F ederal Gov ern- ment, including military bases ; and cannot travel to or through States in which med ical Cannabis has not been legalized, without risk of arrest and pros ecution. Consequent ly, the phy sicians who re commend med i- cal Cannabis, the busi nesses that manufacture and distribute med ical Cannabis, and the patients who need and use it remain at constant risk that they could be arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated by the Federal Gov ernment at any time. 17. In the conte xt of the Right to Travel, med ical Cannabis patients in par ticular are sub jected to a Hobson's Choice of : (i) using their medication but relin - quishing their Right to Travel ; (ii) exercising their Right to Travel while carrying their medication with them, there by risking seizure, arrest, pros ecution, conviction and incarceration ; or (iii) exercising their Right to Travel but foregoing phy sician-recommended medical treat ment that maintains their health and lives. Engaging in an open vio lation of the CSA and subjecting them selves to the risk of arrest does not constitute a viable option for Plain tiffs. The alter na- tive of leaving their life -sustaining and life -saving medication behind would threaten those Plain tiffs treating with me dical Cannabis (and for whom it constitutes a life -saving and -sustaining medicine) with the loss of their health and lives which, as demon - strated below, would constitute a deprivation of their fundamental rights to Sub stantive Due Process (Third Cause of Action). 18. Fourth , the CSA as it pertains to med ical Cannabis violates the Commerce Clause and the App. 168a Tenth Amend ment to the United States Con stitution. While empowered by Article I to regulate interstate and international commerce, Con gress does not have the author ity to regulate purely intra -state activ ities which do not have any impact on the national economy. Any use of med ical Cannabis that is legalized and regulated entirely within an indi vidual State's borders does not have any appreciable impact on the national economy. And Con gress, in enacting the CSA, never believed that the cultivation, distribution and sale of Cannabis, purely at the intra -state level, ever affected or will affect the national economy. 19. Regu lation of doctor -patient rela tionships and the admin istration of med ical advice has been, since ratification of the United States Con stitution and subsequent adoption of the Tenth Amend ment, con- sistently interpreted as falling within the exclusive regulatory juris diction of the States (not the Fed eral Government) under the provisions of the Tenth Amend - ment. By injecting itself into the exclusive regulatory jurisdiction of the States, Con gress exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause and violated principles of federalism and the Tenth Ame ndment of the United States Con stitution (Fourth Cause of Action). 20. Fifth , the Schedule I classification as it pertains to Cannabis constitutes a com plete ly and utterly irrational legis lative construct and thus violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment. Spe - cifically, under the CSA, Schedule I drugs are classified as so dangerous that they gen erally cannot be test ed safely ; however, in order to obtain the evi- dence neces sary to persuade the Fed eral Gov ernment that Cannabis is safe enough to be rescheduled or de - scheduled, it must be tested. By imposing as App. 169a precondition to re -classification, the testing of a pur- portedly un -testable gress created a legis lative Gordian Knot \u2014a statute that functions as a one -way, dead end street. 6 21. What transforms this poorly -conceived pro- vision into an un constitutional on e is that Cannabis was categorized as a Schedule I drug, not because the evidence presented during the legis lative process act - ually demonstrated that it was dangerous, but rather because certain members of Con gress pretextually claimed that the data for classifying Cannabis in the first instance was, at the time, supposedly insuf fi- cient. Accord ingly, Cannabis was to be tested and then rescheduled, de -scheduled or left under the provisions of Schedule I. In classifyi ng Cannabis as a Schedule I drug in the first instance, how ever, Con - gress permanently resigned Cannabis to that desig na- tion because in the absence of testing, those seeking to petition to reclassify Cannabis are deprived of the oppor tunity to collec t the very evi dence deemed neces - sary by the Fed eral Gov ernment to reschedule or de - schedule it (Fifth Cause of Action). 22. Sixth , the CSA, as applied to Plain tiffs Alexis Bortell (\"Alexis\") and Jagger Cotte (\"Jagger\"), deprives them of their rights under the First Amend ment to free speech and to petition the Fed eral Gov ernment for a redress of grievances. Spe cifically, Alexis and Jagger cannot travel to the Capitol in Washington, DC to petition the Fed eral Gov ernment to enact 6 This is not to suggest that no one has ever obtained per mission from the Fed eral Gov ernment to test med ical Cannabis ; but the vetting pro cess renders the approval process sub stantially impracticable. App. 170a legislation which they regard as beneficial, or to repeal laws which they regard as harmful unless they leave their life -saving and -sustaining Cannabis medication behind \u2014a sub stantial risk for each of these Plain tiffs. Thus, for example, Alexis and Jagger cannot visit their elected repre sentatives to lobby in favor of repealing the CSA or in favor of the Marijuana Justice Act (\"MJA\"), which Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey is preparing to introduce during the next legis lative session. The availability of other forms of commu nication from a distance does not, as a matter of law, constitute an effec tive or appro priate sub stitute for in -person advocacy under the First Amend ment, particularly under the cir cumstances of this case. 23. Under principles of Sub stantive Due Process, the right to preserve one's health and life by continuing to treat with life -sustaining and life -saving medication, is deeply -rooted in our Nation's history and traditions, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. By re- quiring Alexis and Jagger to forfeit that fun damental right in order to exer cise their First Amend ment rights (and vice versa), the CSA imposes an un consti- tutional Hobson' s Choice upon the aforemen tioned Plain tiffs and thus violates the Con stitution (Sixth Cause of Action). 24. Lastly , the Fed eral Gov ernment cannot maintain its position on the existing record that con - tinued enforce ment of the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis is \"sub stantially just ified.\" Accord ingly, under the Equal Access to Justice Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412), Plain tiffs are entitled to an award of legal fees and costs. App. 171a JURISDICTION AND VENUE 25. This Cou rt has sub ject matter juris diction over this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391(e) and 1402(a)(1). PLAINTIFFS Marvin Washington 27. Plain tiff Marvin Washington (\"Washington\") is, and at all relevant times has been, a citizen, resident and domiciliary of the County of Dallas in the State of Texas. 28. Washington is a graduate of the Uni versity of Idaho and is a member of the Uni versity's Sports Hall of Fame. 29. From 1989 to 1999, Washington played pro - fessional football as a defensive lineman for such National Football League franchises as the New York Jets, San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos, winning a Super Bowl with the l atter. 30. After his retirement from pro fessional football, Washington entered the busi ness world, working for Kannalife, a Long Island com pany that has been developing Cannabis -based medications to minimize the damage caused by head injuries and to reduce and ultimately eliminate opioid addiction among profes- sional athletes. Washington is currently working with a Swiss com pany known as Isidiol that has launched, among other things, a line of products infused with Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, produced App. 172a in the European Union, out side the confines of the CSA. 7 31. Washington would like to expand his busi ness to include whole -plant Cannabis (including THC) products, but is con cerned that, even in States in which whole -plant Cannabis is legal for med ical and/or recreational use, he may be sub ject to arrest and pros ecution. 32. Washington would like to avail himself of the benefits asso ciated with the Fed eral Minority Busi - ness prise program (\"MBE\") in con nection with whole-plant Cannabis products, but he is ineligible for it solely because such activ ities would be illegal under the CSA. Were Washington to open a whole -plant Cannabis busi ness and apply for parti cipation in the MBE, he would be admitting to the com mission of a felony under Fed eral Law. 33. Accord ing to the Fed eral Gov ernment, CBD falls within the ambit of the classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, unless extracted from industrial hemp or a part of the Cannabis plant exempted from the CSA. 34. Washington is con cerned that, al though CBD products gen erally have a low co ncentration or no concentration of THC, his existing busi ness could be subjected to enforce ment under the CSA. 35. Washington is African Amer ican. 7 CBD, al though part of the Cannabis plant, gen erally has no psychoactive effect. Nonetheless, it is currently the position of the Fed eral Gov ernment that the cultivation and/or sale o f CBD is prohibited under the CSA. App. 173a Dean Bortell and Alexis Bortell 36. Plain tiff Dean Bortell is, and at all relevant times has been, a citizen of Texas and Colorado, currently residing in Larkspur, Colorado (\"Dean\"). 37. Dean is a former member of the Navy, and is a 100% permanently -disabled veteran of foreign wars (\"VFW\"). 38. As a disabled VFW, his children are entitled to receive cer tain veteran's benefits (\"Veterans' Benefits\"), including, inter alia , ance and the right to use the commissary of any nearby military base. 39. Dean is Alexis's father. 40. Alexis is, and at all relevant times has been, a citizen of Texas and Colorado, currently residing in Larkspur, Colorado. 41. Alexis is an 11 -year-old girl, who lives with her parents. 42. At the age of seven, Alexis began experiencing seizures, and was eventually diagnosed with a condition known as \"intractable epilepsy.\" 43. Intractable epilepsy is a seizure disorder in which a patient's seizures cannot be safely con trolled with FDA approved med ical treat ments and pro cedures. 44. By reason of her intractable epilepsy, Alexis often suffered from mul tiple seizures per day, and spent most of her school -day afternoons in the nurse's office. 45. Alexis, with the assis tance of her family and treat ment pro viders, attempted to treat, control and App. 174a cure her intractable epilepsy for years without success. Noth ing she tried worked. 46. After two years of doctor visits, tests, urgent trips to the emergency room, and pill after pill, all with their assortment of negative side effects, her family exhausted tra ditional pharmaceutical options to stop what Alexis referred to as the \"seizure monster.\" At that point, they turned to the last known option avail able : whole -plant Cannabis con taining high con - centrations of THC. 47. Whole -plant Cannabis with high THC content provided Alexis imme diate relief from her seizures, but it is not legal in Texas, where she resided at the time. Accord ingly, Alexis and her family were forced to move from her home State of Texas to seek life - saving treat ment in Colorado. There, Alexis was thrust into a very grown -up world and joined a then - largely un known community of Cannabis patients known as \"Med ical Marijuana Refugees.\" 48. Since being on whole -plant med ical Cannabis, Alexis has gone more than two years seizure -free, without taking any other medication to co ntrol her seizures. 49. Without her use of whole -plant med ical Cannabis, Alexis would likely have no quality of life, and instead be resigned to spending her days at home inside or worse, in a hos pital bed, as med ical care - givers surround her with o ffers of palliative care which fail to pro vide any actual palliative relief. In addition, Alexis would be sub jected to tra ditional forms of treat ment which, aside from being ineffectual, threaten her with serious and life -altering side effects, including infertility. App. 175a 50. Alexis co -authored the book, Let's Talk About Medical Cannabis , which was launched on April 20, 2017. In her book, she shares her and her family's experiences as \"Med ical Marijuana Refugees\" and gives readers a perspective into the Cannabis refugee community. 51. Alexis was also named a PACT National Pediatric Ambassador (2015 -16), and received the Texas Liberty Award (along with her sister) in 2016. 52. Alexis's drive to help those around her led to her newest project, \"Patches of Hope.\" She and her sister Avery are growing USDA certified organic garden vegetables on their family farm to donate to hungry people in need, including her beloved Med ical Marijuana Refugees. Her story and advocacy have been featured in doc umentaries, newspapers, maga - zines, TV, and on radio stations worldwide. 53. While thrilled with the success she has experienced in treating her intractable epilepsy and eliminating her daily seizures with med ical Cannabis, Alexis would like to move back to Texas, where she would be eligible for free college tuition through Texas's State Depart ment of Edu cation. Alexis is not eligible for free state edu cation in Colorado. 54. In addi tion, Alexis would like to travel to other States and to fed eral lands (including, for example, national parks and monuments), but cannot safely do so without fear that : (i) her parents, with whom she would travel, might be prosecuted for possession of Cannabis ; or worse (ii) her parents might be sub jected to pro ceedings which would imperil their parental rights. App. 176a 55. Separate and apart from her desire to travel to other States, national parks and monuments, Alexis would like to visit, and has been invited to speak with, members of Con gress at the Capitol, inter alia, to lobby in favor of repealing the CSA and in favor of the MJA, which would have the effect of de - scheduling Cannabis. 56. How ever, Alexis cannot make a trip to the Capitol and visit with her elected repre sentatives and other public officials unless she were to leave her med - ical Cannabis behind, endangering her life. 57. There is no comparable sub stitute for the oppor tunity to visit public officials and engage in in - person advocacy. 58. Insofar as Alexis is a mi nor, she cannot vote; her ability to influence her elected repre sentatives is limited to efforts by her to advocate in sup port of beneficial legislation and against -laws she regards as harmful. 59. Alexis would also like to avail herself of the Veterans Benefits for which she is eligible and which she would otherwise receive were it not for her neces - sary Cannabis use ; however, Alexis cannot enter the neighboring military base, where she would be ab le to avail herself of such Benefits, including, for example, commissary benefits, unless she were to leave her medication behind, risking her health. And, although currently receiving health insur ance (another of the Veterans Benefits to which she is entitled) through her father's veteran's benefit plan, Alexis will almost certainly lose her eli gibility within the next three years, as she would be re quired to enter a United States military base to renew her health App. 177a insur ance card \u2014a trip she cannot sa fely make without taking her State -legal, but fed erally-illegal, medication with her. Thus, Alexis and her family are subjected to an un accept able Hobson's Choice : (A) discontinuing the only medication that has ever eliminated her seizures (there by resigning herself to living permanently with a dangerous and disabling illness) so that she could return to Texas ; or (B) continuing to use her medication but refusing to relinquish her Right to Travel, risking arrest, pros e- cution and her parents' loss of parental rights ; or (C) continuing to use her medication within the State of Colorado but foregoing her rights to : (i) live in Texas ; (ii) receive free tuition in Texas ; (iii) travel to other States ; (iv) use an airplane to travel to any o ther State ; (v) step onto fed eral lands or into fed eral buildings ; (vi) access military bases ; and (vii) receive her father's Veteran's Benefits (\"Hobson's Choice\"). Jose Belen 60. Plain tiff Jose Belen is a citizen of the State of Florida, with a res idence in Seminole County (\"Jose\"). 61. On Jan uary 16, 2002, at the age of 19, Jose enlisted in the United States Army. 62. Soon after enlisting in the Army, Jose was deployed to Germany, where he par ticipated in training exercises and awaited fur ther deployment. 63. On March 20, 2003, the United States Military began an invasion of Iraq, under the code -name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom.\" 64. In or around May 2003, Jose and his battalion were deployed to Kuwait. App. 178a 65. Jose's battalion was then pushed directly into active combat, receiving orders to cross the Iraq - Kuwait border and march on to enter Baghdad. 66. In con nection with this mission, Jose then served in Iraq for 14 months, often witnessing brutal armed combat first -hand. 67. During his deployment, Jose came to know many of his fellow soldiers personally, developing strong, emotional bonds. 68. During his deployment, Jose was in grave danger and witnessed the killing of sev eral fellow soldiers, including his best friend and roommate. 69. After he was honorably dis charged, Jose moved to Florida. 70. It soon became clear to Jose that he was unable to forget and/or otherwise cope with his memory of the horrors of war that he had lived through in Iraq. 71. Jose devel oped Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\"). 72. PTSD is an ailment which commonly afflicts members of the armed forces who have seen active combat. 73. Because of his PTSD, the Veterans Affairs Admin istration declared Jose \"70% disabled.\" 74. Jose sought treat ment f or his PTSD from the medical staff at the Veterans Affairs Admin istration and other treat ment centers. 75. The med ical staff at the Veteran Affairs Admin istration issued Jose prescriptions for different opioid medications. App. 179a 76. The aforesaid and described prescriptions were ineffec tive and often fur ther disabling. 77. Jose's PTSD intensified, and became so severe that Jose often contemplated taking his own life. 78. Statistics show that an average of 22 Amer i- can military veterans com mit suicide every day. 79. Upon infor mation and belief, most of these suicides are directly linked to PTSD. 80. Jose sub sequent ly discovered that Cannabis is the only substance which act ually reduced his PTSD symptoms. 81. Since he began treating with med ical Cannabis, Jose has been able to cope with his PTSD. 82. Jose has dis closed his need for med ical Cannabis to his Veterans Admin istration phy sicians. 83. Jose's treat ment pro viders at the Veterans Admin istration informed Jose that they are unable to prescribe med ical Cannabis because it is illegal under the CSA. 84. As with Alexis, Jose cannot, while possessing his med ical Cannabis : (i) enter a military base ; (ii) travel by airplane ; (iii) step onto fe deral lands or into federal buildings ; (iv) travel to States where med ical Cannabis is illegal and enforced under the CSA ; (v) request med ical Cannabis from his treating phy sicians ; and/or otherwise (vi) avail himself of the Veterans Benefits for which he is otherwise eligible and to which he is legally entitled. Thus, as with Alexis, Jose is sub jected to a similar Hobson's Choice \u2014his life and health, or the exer cise of his con stitutional rights and the risk of arrest. App. 180a 85. Separ ate and apart from his desire to receive Veterans Benefits, Jose would like to visit and speak with members of Con gress at the Capitol to lobby in favor of, inter cilia, repealing the CSA and in favor of the MJA, which would have the effect of de -scheduli ng Cannabis. 86. How ever, Jose cannot make a trip to the Capitol and visit with his elected repre sentatives and other public officials unless he were to leave his med - ical Cannabis behind. 87. There is no comparable sub stitute for the oppor tunity to visit public officials and engage in in - person advocacy. Sebastien Cotte and Jagger Cotte 88. Sebastien Cate is, and at all relevant times has been, a citizen and domiciliary of the State of Georgia, with a residence in Dekalb County (\"Sebastien\" ). 89. Jagger Cotte is, and at all relevant times has been, a citizen and domiciliary of the State of Georgia, with a residence in Dekalb County. 90. Sebastien is Jagger's father. 91. Jagger is a six -year old boy who lives with his parents, including hi s father, Sebastien. 92. Jagger suffers from a rare, congenital disease known as \"Leigh's Disease,\" which disables and then kills approx imately 95% of people afflicted with it (if diagnosed before age 2) by the time that they reach the age of four. 93. Consistent with his diagnosis and prognosis, Jagger, beginning at age one, became a hospice patient, App. 181a unable to communicate, walk, masticate food, and/or otherwise handle any activ ities of daily living. 94. Worse, Jagger began experiencing near - consta nt pain, shrieking in agony as he tried to get through each day. 95. As Sebastien and his wife prepared for what they expected would be their son's inevitable demise, they turned to Cannabis with high concentrations of THC, in the hope of reducing his pai n and prolonging his life. 96. Since he began treating with med ical Can - nabis with high concentrations of THC, Jagger has stopped screaming in pain, has been able to interact with his parents, and has prolonged his life by more than two years. 97. Cann abis with a THC concentration of greater than 5% is illegal in the State of Georgia. 98. Because his re quired dosage for effec tive treat ment of his condition re quires a THC content greater than 5%, Jagger cannot obtain his med ical Cannabis in State. 99. Worse, Georgia has no regulatory protocol for the cultivation, distribution and sale of Cannabis. Thus, assuming that med ical Cannabis with a THC content of 5% were suf ficient to treat Jagger's \u2014and it isn't \u2014obtaining State -legal med ical Cannabis in Georgia is impossible, as it is unavail able for purchase in a dispensary or otherwise. 100. At one point, Jagger and his family relocated to Colorado so as to facilitate the admin istration of his medication ; however, maintaining two re sidences and caring for a dying child full time rendered this App. 182a prospect economically infeasible. Con sequent ly, the Cotte family returned to Georgia (by car). 101. As with Alexis and Jose, Jagger cannot travel by airplane, enter onto fed eral lands or in to fed - eral buildings, and/or travel to and/or through States in which med ical Cannabis, by reason of the CSA and other legislation, is illegal. Thus, Jagger is resigned to a Hobson's Choice of : (i) relinquishing his con stitu- tional rights because of his treat ment with med ical Cannabis ; or (ii) retaining his con stitutional rights but foregoing his med ical treat ment and sub jecting himself to the uncompromisingly painful and ulti - mately fatal effects of his illness ; or (iii) traveling without regard to where Cannabis is legal or illegal and risking his or his father's arrest. 102. Jagger would like to visit with members of Congress at the Capitol and, through his father, lobby in favor of repealing the CSA and in favor of the MJA, which would have the effect of de -scheduling Cannabis. 103. How ever, Jagger cannot make a trip to the Capitol and visit with his elected repre sentatives and other public officials unless he were to leave his med - ical Cannabis behind, there by endangering his life. 104. There is no comparable sub stitute for the oppor tunity to visit public officials and engage in in - person advocacy. 105. Insofa r as Jagger is a minor, he cannot vote ; his ability to influence his elected repre sentatives is limited to efforts by him (through his father) to advocate in sup port of beneficial legislation and against laws he regards as harmful. App. 183a Cannabis Cultural Association, Inc. 106. Cannabis Cultural Asso ciation, Inc. (\"CCA\") is, and at all relevant times has been, a not -for-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, with a prin cipal headquarters in the Ci ty and County of New York. 107. The CCA was founded to pro vide a voice and forum to assist persons of color to develop a presence in the Cannabis industry \u2014an industry in which they are and, at all relevant times have been, grossly under -repre sented excep t when it comes to being arrested. 108. People of color, especially black males, are up to four times as likely to be arrested in con nection with Cannabis than white Amer icans, and make up nearly 70% of the 2.5 million people in prison for drug crimes (even though use among races is virtually equal). 109. Convictions for vio lations of the CSA and other statutes criminalizing cultivation, distribution and/or use of Cannabis frequently dis qualify indi viduals from participating in State -legal med ical Cannabis businesses. By reason of the foregoing, persons of color, who are disproportionately inves tigated and prosecuted for drug offenses, have been unfairly and inequitably excluded from the Cannabis industry. 110. Members of the CCA include persons of color who have been arrested, prosecuted, con victed and/or incarcerated for vio lating the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis. App. 184a DEFENDANTS Sessions 111. Defend ant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, III (\"Sessions\") is, and since on or about Fe bruary 8, 2017 has been, the Attor ney General of the United States. 8 112. Before his ascension to Attor ney General, Sessions, from 1997 until in or about late 2016, served as a United States Senator on behalf of the people of the State of Alabama. 113. Prior to his installation as a United States Senator, Sessions was a United States Attor ney for the Southern Dis trict of Alabama. 114. While serving as a United States Attor ney, Sessions was nominated to serve as a United States District Court Judge ; however, his nomination was with drawn following a series of Senate hearings at which witnesses tes tified that Sessions had : made racially insensitive remarks to African Amer ican Assistant U.S. Attor neys ; spoken favorably of the Ku Klux Klan ; referred to a white civil rights attor ney as \"maybe\" a \"disgrace to his race ;\" repeatedly referred to an African Amer ican Assistant U.S. Attor ney as \"boy\" and had instructed the latter to \"be care ful what you say to white folks ;\" 8 Sessions is sued only in his official capacity as Attor ney General. App. 185a remarked that th e NAACP and ACLU were \"un-Amer ican\" and \"Communist -inspired,\" and that they were trying to force civil rights \"down the throats of people ;\" and complained that he had wished he could decline all civil rights cases. 9 115. Sessions was never again nominated to sit on the Fed eral Bench. 116. Upon infor mation and belief, Sessions is, and at all relevant times since 1997 has been, a citizen of Alabama, and a resident of both Alabama and Washington, DC. 117. Sessions, as Attor ney General, is auth orized to re -schedule, de -schedule and/or decline to re - schedule or de -schedule any drug classified under the provisions of the CSA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811. 118. As shown below, Sessions has announced that : he was \"heartbroken\" that former President Obama said that \"Cannabis is not as dangerous as alcohol ;\" he believes that Cannabis is \"a dangerous drug ;\" 9 Sessions admit ted that he had made favorable comments about the Ku Klux Klan, but claimed he was not being serious and later apologized. He claimed not to remember saying that a white civil rights law yer was \"maybe\" a \"disgrace to his race.\" As to the comments about the ACLU and NAACP, Sessions claimed to have been referring to the organ izations' supposed sup port for the Sandinistas in Ni caragua. He denied making the other above -refer enced state ments attributed to him. App. 186a he believes that \"good people don't smoke mari - juana ;\" and he thought favorably of the Ku Klux Klan, but then changed his view when he learned that its members supposedly smoke \"pot.\" 119. On or about May 1, 2017, Sessions sent cor - respondence to Con gress requesting that funding be provided that could allow the United States Depart - ment of Justice (\"DOJ\") to resume criminal pros ecu- tions of : (i) State -legal med ical pro med ical Cannabis to patients, and (iii) phy sicians who re commend such treat ment. 10 120. On July 19, 2017, Sessions announced his intention to resume civil forfeiture activity, pre viously discon tinued under the Obama Admin istration, as part of his con tinued war against those whom Sessions claims are engaged in dangerous, illegal drug activity. 11 United States Department of Justice 121. Defend ant DOJ is, and since in or about 1870 has been, an executive depart ment of the United States, \"with the Attor ney General as its head.\" 12 10 As discussed below, Con gress had pre viously enacted legislation that prevents the Attor ney General and Depart ment of Justice from using legis lative appropriation s to prosecute those in State - legal med ical Cannabis juris dictions operating in conformity 187a 122. Accord ing to the mission state ment con tained on its website, the DOD's pur pose is : [t]o enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States accord ing to the law ; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic ; to pro vide fed eral leadership in preventing and control ling crime ; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlaw ful behavior ; and to ensure fair and impartial admin istration of justice for all Amer icans. 13 123. To the extent that the DOJ treats med ical Cannabis as a dangerous and illegal substance, Plain - tiffs and everyone else who may need to use, or who desire to cultivate and/or sell, med ical Cannabis are at risk of inves tigation and pros ecution by the DOJ. Charles \"Chuck\" Rosenberg and the DEA 124. Defend ant Charles \"Chuck\" Rosenberg (\"Rosenberg\") is, and since May 2015 has been, the acting head of the defend ant Drug Enforce ment Admin istration (\"DEA\"). 14 125. Defend ant DEA is, and since 1973 has been, a Fed eral agency charged with the res ponsibility of investigating and, together with the DOJ, enforcing, the CSA, and any other con trolled substances laws and regu lations of the United States. 13 Id. 14 Rosenberg is sued only in his official capacity as Acting Administrator of the DEA.

Cannabis Has Been Cultivated and Safely Used Throughout World History 10,000 BC until the Birth of Christ 129. Cannabis has been utilized in a multitude of ways by diverse groups of people all over the world for the last 10,000 years. 16 130. The first doc umented use of Cannabis took place in the area of modern day Taiwan where hemp cords were identified in pottery found in an ancient village dating back to about 10,000 years ago. 17 15 http ://www. cbsnews. 1 at 1, 7 -8; Leslie Iversen, THE SCIENCE OF MARIJUANA 122 (2000) ; 17 Deitch, supra note 1 at 7 -8; 10,000-year History of Marijuana Use in the World, ADVANCED HOLISTIC HEALTH , http ://www.App. 189a 131. In 6,000 B.C., China became the first country known to utilize Cannabis seeds and oil for food and, along with Turkestan, China began cultivating hemp for the p urpose of producing textiles in 4,000 B.C. 18 132. The first doc umented med ical use of Cannabis also occurred in China (in or around 2900 B.C.) when Chinese Emperor Fu Hsi, the father of Chinese civilization, noted that \"Ma,\" the Chinese word for Canna bis, was a \"very popular medicine that possessed both yin and yang.\" 19 Its popularity at that time has been confirmed by the \"Pen ts'ao,\" a Chinese digest of herbal medicines which was first published in or about 2800 B.C. 133. The Pen ts'ao \"re commended Cannabis for the treat ment of constipation, gout, malaria, rheu ma- tism, and menstrual problems.\" 20 134. Hemp in par ticular was so important in ancient China that the Chinese people referred to their country as the \"land of mulberry and hemp.\" 21 135.

The ancient Egyptians used Cannabis at that time to treat sore eyes and cataracts, inflam - mation, hemorrhoids, menstrual bleeding, and Glaucoma. 23 And while the ancient Chinese were the first people known to use Cannabis as medicine, \"it was the ancient Egyptians who first identified cancer as an illness and then treated it with Cannabis.\" 24 137. Beginning in 2,000 B.C., the use of Cannabis expanded to suit reli gious and spiritual pur poses as well. 25 Around this time, a sacred Hindu text, Atharvaveda, first refers to \"Bhang,\" an intoxicant made from the leaves of the female Cannabis plant, as one of the five sacred plants of India. 26 138. Bhang was used in ancient India medicinally as an anesthetic and anti -phlegmatic. 27 139. Bhang was used in ancient India reli giously as an offering to the god Shiva. 28 140. In approx imately 1450 B.C., when the events of the Book of Exodus (30 :22-23) are alleged to have contested by the DEA, the ALJ observed : \"Uncontroverted evi - dence [o]n this record indicates that marijuana was being used therapeutically by mankind 2000 years before the Birth of Christ\" (citation omitted). 23 Rankin supra note 22 ; See also PROCON.ORG, supra note 3. 24 Rankin supra note 22. 25 See ADVANCED HOLISTIC HEALTH , supra note 17. 26 Id.; Charukesi Ramadurai, The Intoxicating Drug of an Indian God, HEALTH , supra note 17.

The use of Cannabis as a medicinal substance continued to spread throughout Asia and Europe for centuries. 143. The Venidad, a Persian text dating back to 700 BC, cited Cannabis as being one of the most significant of 10,000 medicinal plants. 31 144. By 600 B.C.

Greece, Cannabis was utilized as a remedy for earaches, edema, and inflammation. 33 Cultivation and Use of Cannabis from the Birth of Christ Through the Period of Colonial America 146. An important Roman med ical text, De Materia Medica, was published in 70 A.D. 147. De Materia Medica refers to the Cannabis plant as \"produc[ing] a juice\" that was \"used to treat earache[s] and to suppress sexual longing.\" 34 148. By 200 A.D., a Chinese phy sician, Hua T'o, became the first known surgeon to use Cannabis as an anesthetic during surgeries such as \"organ grafts, re - sectioning of intestines, laparotomies (incisions into the loin), and thoracotomies (incisions into the chest).\" 35 149. Ancient civilizations cultivated the Cannabis plant, not merely for medicinal and reli gious needs, but also to produce industrial hemp for the manufac - turing of items such as paper, rope, sails, and linen. 33 U.S. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON MARIHUANA AND DRUG ABUSE , MARIHUANA , A SIGNAL OF MISUNDER STAND ING, Appendix, Chapter One, Part 1(1972). 34 PROCON.ORG, supra note 3 (citing Martin Booth, CANNABIS : A HISTORY (2005)). 35 Ernest L.

Between 900 -1200 A.D., the Arab world, Spain, Italy, England, France, and Germany all began replicating China's hemp -paper manufacturing process. 37 152. The Venetian Republic, the first known Western European nation to industrialize around the product ion of hemp and the first European country to experience genuine economic progress emerging from the Dark Ages in the late 10th Century A.D., elevated the art of processing raw hemp into rope, sails and fine linen -like cloth. 38 This reliance upon Cannabis to produce industrial hemp lasted well into the Middle Ages and spread all across Europe. 39 153. Britain became the \"industrial goliath of Western Europe\" in large part due to its exploitation of hemp for the manufacture of, among other things, rope and sa il-commodities that were essential to its large merchant and naval fleet. 40 154. In 1533, King Henry VIII imposed a law mandating that farmers grow hemp. 41 155.

Britain, during the 16th and 17th Centuries, utilized Cannabis for its medicinal pr operties as well. 44 The Importance of Cannabis to Colonial America 158. By the 17th Century, Britain began colonizing much of the world, including the Americas in par ticular. 159. Britain's colonization empire was built, in part, upon its cultivation, d istribution and use of hemp ; however, Britain began to exhaust its geographic agricultural resources to produce adequate amounts of hemp. 45 42 Id. 43 Id. at 14. 44 Queen Elizabeth I's doctor prescribed Cannabis to her to relieve her menstrual pain.

App. 195a 160. England's need for hemp was so sub stantial that, in 1611, after its estab lishment of the Jamestown Colony in the Americas, England gave direct orders to the colonists to grow hemp for the production of rope, sails, and clothing. 46 161. In 1619, \"[t]he Virginia Com pany, by decree of King James for export.\" 47 162. In 1663, the English Parliament passed legislation, granting rights and privileges of natural - born citizens to \"any foreigner who settled in England or Wales and estab lishe d a hemp -related industry within three years,\" in order to encourage those fleeing persecution in Europe to seek refuge in England. 48 163. The value of hemp was so well -recog nized in the Americas during the colonial period that it was frequently used as a barter medium, and farmers were per mitted to pay part of their taxes using the plant in the colonies of Virginia (1682), Maryland (1683), and Pennsylvania (1706). 49 164.

App. 196a its own production of goods. 50 However, a combination of America's first textile and shipbuilding industries created a burgeoning domestic market for local hemp, which led the colonists to retain the vast majority of Amer ican raw hemp for their own local production of rope, paper, and cloth, rather than for export to England. 51 These growing Amer ican industries, based principally upon hemp, helped pave the wa y for America's economic independence from England. 52 The Founding Fathers' Cultivation, Distribution and Sale of Cannabis in All its Variations 165. Among the colonists to benefit economically from the commercial uses of hemp in the Americas were the Foun ding Fathers \u2014several of whom derived significant portions of their wealth from the production of hemp or hemp -based goods. 53 166. The men who cultivated and/or used hemp included, inter alia, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and one of America's richest colonists, Robert \"King\" Carter. 54 167. Indeed, \"Jefferson received the first United States patent for his invention of a machine that 50 Id. at 20. 51 Id. 52 Id. 53 Id. at 19. 54 Id. App. 197a would break hemp (that is, start the process of extracting the fibers). 55 168. Benjamin Franklin , America's leading paper producer, became wealthy from the cultivation of hemp, since that was what paper was made from at that time. 56 169. Hemp was so widely utilized in the late 1700s that early drafts of the Dec laration of Independence and the Unit ed States Con stitution were written on it ;57 many of the supplies and uniforms needed for the Revolutionary War were made from it;58 and the first United States flag was made from hemp cloth. 59 170. In fact, all official Amer ican flags were made of hemp until 1937, when Con gress enacted the Marijuana Tax Act, discussed infra .60 171. Colonial America's use of the Cannabis plant was by no means restricted to industrial uses. \"[C] olo- nial Amer icans were aware of the medicinal properties 55 Id.

Some of the Founding Fathers also smoked Cannabis (known at that time as \"hemp\" or \"sweet hemp\") for both medicinal and recreational pur poses. 62 173. Entries from George Washington's diary reveal that Washington grew hemp at his plantation, Mount Vernon, for approx imately 30 years. 63 174. George Washington spe cifically grew Can na- bis with high THC concentrations \u2014the very substance that today, would sub ject him to pros ecution and incarceration under the CSA. 64 175.

App. 199a 176. James Madison stated that sweet hemp \"gave him insight to create a new and democratic nation.\" 66 177. The notion that Cannabis negatively impairs a user's mental or physical abilities is rendered ludicrous by the fact that the vi sionaries of our democratic system of gov ernment were known to use (and admit ted using) Cannabis on a regular basis. 67 Post-Revolutionary War Use of Cannabis for Non - Medical and Medical Purposes 178. At the con clusion of the Revolutionary War in 1781, the value of industrial hemp plummeted. 179. By 1850, hemp dropped to the third most commonly -grown agricultural crop in America \u2014it had been the first until this time \u2014behind only cotton and tobacco. 68 180. During the mid -19th Century, due to the introduction of more modern sailing ships, hemp became obsolete for military pur poses. 69 66 Julian Sonny, The Presidents Who Admit ted to Smoking Weed, ELITE DAILY (Feb. 18 2013), http ://elitedaily. note I at 27. Aside from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, whose Cannabis use is discussed supra, other Amer ican Presidents known to have smoked cannabis include : James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, Abraham Lincoln, John F.

At or about the time that hemp became obsolete for military pur poses, Cannabis was still a mainstream form of medicine in the West and par tic- ularly in the Unite d States. 182. Cannabis was formally introduced into Wes- tern medicine in the 1830s by William O'Shaughnessy, a doctor working for the British East India Com pany .70 183. After experimenting with Cannabis on both animals and humans for years, Dr. O'Shaughn essy concluded that Cannabis was an \"anti -convulsive remedy of the highest value\" 71 and that it was highly effec tive in treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, spasticity, and pain. 72 184. Shortly after making the aforemen tioned and described d iscoveries, Dr. O'Shaughnessy and a London pharmacist created an extract from Cannabis, later termed \"Squire's Extract.\" 185. Dr. O'Shaughnessy put Squire's Extract on the market as an analgesic. 73 70 Martin Booth, CANNABIS : A HISTORY 109-10 (2003) ; Steve DeAngelo, THE CANNABIS MANIFESTO : A NEW PARADIGM FOR WELLNESS 48 (2015). 71 Id. 72 DeAngelo, supra note 70 at 48. 73 Booth, supra note 70 at 112. Indeed, Squire's Extract and similar medicines became quite popular among phy sicians who found that the only other pain killer that was equally effec tive was opium, which unlike Cannabis -based products, they found to be highly addictive and riddled with adverse side effects. Id. at 113. App. 201a 186. After the devel opment of Squire's Extract, Cannabis made its way fur ther into Amer ican medicine as \"Tilden's Extract.\" 74 187. As early as 1840, studies regard ing the med- ical uses of Cannabis appeared in Amer ican med ical academic publications. 75 188. By 1850, the widely -distributed United States Pharmacopoeia , a highly selective listing of America's most widely taken medicines, listed Cannabis as a treat ment for \"neuralgia, tetanus, typhus, cholera, rabies, dysentery, alcoholism, and opiate addiction, anthrax, leprosy, incontinence, snake bite, gout, bleeding[ ], and uterine hemorrhaging .\"76 74 Id. at 112 -13. 75 DeAngelo, supra note 70 at 50. 76 Booth, supra note 70 at 113 -14; Edward M.

How ever, by 1913, the U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry deter mined that it had succeeded in growing Cannabis of equal quality to the Indian variety. Id. Thus, when World War I disrupted America's receipt of foreign supplies, the United States was able to be self -sufficient in the production of Cannabis. Id. \"By 1918, some 60,000 pounds were being produced annually, all from pharmaceutical farms east of the Mississippi.\" Id. App. 202a 189. Thereafter, the Pharmacopoeia included Can - nabis , later known as \"Extractum Cannabis\" or \"Extract of Hemp,\" as a treat ment for addi tional ail - ments and conditions. 77 190.

Legal Cannabis Cigarettes were so highly regarded as a remedy for asthma in late 19th Century America that the Boston Med ical and Surgical Journal, in its 1860 publication, adver tised Legal Cannabis Cigarettes, which were manufactured by Grimault & Co., as being able to \"promptly\" cure or relieve \"Asthma, Bronchitis, Loss of Voice, and other infections of the respiratory organs.\" 82 79 Booth, supra note 70 at 116. 80 Viewers' Guide to the Botany of Desire : Based on the book by Michael Pollan, Chapter 3, p. 7, 81 Id.

As a result of the hysteria created by the aforemen tioned and described horror stories published by pro -paper entrepreneurs, Cannabis -became asso ci- ated with Mexican immigrants, and because there was tremendous fear and pre judice with respect to these newcomers, Cannabis likewise became vilified across the country. 89 87 Id. 88 PROCON.ORG supra note 3 (citing Mitchell Earleywine, PhD, UNDER STAND ING MARIJUANA : A NEW LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE (2005). \"William Randolph Hearst was an up -and- coming newspaper tycoon, owning twenty -eight newspapers by the mid -1920s . . .

The MTA effec tively outlawed Cannabis by requiring phy sicians and pharmacists to register and report use of the plant, as well as pay an excise tax for auth orized med ical and industrial uses. 101 212. The MTA was passed even though members of Con gress neither understood the chemical properties of Cannabis, nor had they even read the bill itself. 102 99 Id.; PBS, supra note 46. 100 PBS, supra note 46 ; Thompson, supra note 94. 101 PBS, Supra , note 46. \"The Fed eral law . . . maintained the right to use marijuana for medicinal pur poses but re quired phy - sicians and pharmacists who prescribed or dispensed marijuana to register with fed eral authorities and pay an annual tax or license fee . . .

During Con gressional hearings regard ing the proposed MTA, Dr. William Woodward tes tified: There is nothing in the medicinal use of Cannabis that has any rela tion to Cannabis addiction. I use the word \"Cannabis\" in prefer ence to the word \"marihuana,\" because Cannabis is the cor rect term for describing the plant and its products. The term \"marihuana\" is a mongrel word that has crept into this country over the Mexican border and has no general meaning, except as it relates to the use of Cannabis pre- parations for smoking . . . To say, how ever, as has been proposed here, that the use of the drug should be prevented by a prohibitive tax, loses sight of the fact that future inves tiga- tion may show that there are sub stantial medical uses for Cannabis. 104 215. Despite enactment of the MTA, the United States Depart ment of Agriculture (\"DOA\") and the 103 \"[The]re was little scientific evi dence that sup ported Anslinger's claims.

In 1942, after America lost its access to Asian fiber supplies during World War II, the DOA released a film entitled \"Hemp Fo r Victory\" (Exh, 2), which encouraged farmers to grow hemp, praising its uses for production of parachutes and rope to sup port the war effort. 106 217. In 1944, NYAM issued the \"LaGuardia Report,\" concluding that, \"use of marijuana did not induce violence, insanity or sex crimes, or lead to addiction or other drug use.\" 107 218. Despite the lack of evi dence that Cannabis is or ever was dangerous, and not with stand ing the DOA's insistence that Amer ican fanners con tinue growing hemp war supplies, Ansl inger con tinued his anti -Cannabis campaign throughout the 1940s and 1950s. 108 105 The Asso ciated Press, supra note 84. 106 Id,; Gennett supra note 55. 107 The LaGuardia Report found that : \"The prac tice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction in the med ical sense of the word . . .

App. 212a 219. As heroin addiction in America grew worse during the 1950s, Con gress responded by increasing penalties on Cannabis -related offenses, 109 in large measure because of Anslinge r's bogus claim that \"marijuana\" was a \"gateway drug\" that would eventually lead its users to heroin. 110 220. The 1960's saw a cultural shift in the way Amer icans viewed Cannabis. \"Use of the drug became wide spread among members of the white upper middle class.\" 111 221. Reports requested by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson concluded that Cannabis was not a \"gateway drug\" nor did its use induce violence. 112 222. In 1969, the United States Supreme Court, in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969) struck down the MTA, ruling that it un constitutionally violated the Fifth Amend ment right against self - incrimination. 113 109 Congress included \"marijuana\" in the Narcotics Control Act of 1956, pro viding stricter mandatory sentences for marijuana - related offenses.

After the Supreme Court deci sion in Leary, the Nixon Admin istration urged Con gress to enact legislation that would classify drugs under separate schedules accord ing to their med ical utility, dangerousness, and addictive potential. 114 Congress heeded the President's request by passing the CSA on October 27, 1970. 115 224.

While \"[t]here is almost total agreement among com petent scientists and phy sicians that marihuana is not a morphine . . .

We find little in marihuana's effects or in its social impact to sup port such a de termina- tion.\" 135 233. The Shafer Com mission re commended that possession of Cannabis for personal use be de - criminalized on both the State and Fed eral levels. 136 234. The Nixon Admin istration rejected the find- ings and re commend ations by the Shafer Com mission. 235. The Nixon Admin istration refused to accept the find ings and re commend ations by the Shafer Com mission because they were not con sistent with : (i) the preordained outcome Nixon demanded ; and (ii) the Admin istration's agenda with respect to Cannabis, which was focused on racism and suppression of political and civil rights. 236. John Ehrlichman, who served as the Nixon Admin istration's Dome stic Policy Chief and was one 134 Id. at 140. 135 Id. at 142. 136 Id. at 151. App. 219a of the President's closest political advisors, confirmed that the enactment and enforce ment of the CSA criminalizing Cannabis was di rected toward political suppression and racial dis crim ination. In this regard, Mr. Ehrl ichman said : You want to know what this was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies : the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to asso ciate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those commu - nities . We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. N.Y. Daily New s, A. Edelman, Nixon Aide : \"War on Drugs\" was tool to target \"black people\" (March 23, 2016) (Exh. 3) ; see also Harper's Magazine, D. Baum, Legalize it All : How to Win the War on Drugs (April 2016) (Exh. 4) (\"Nixon's invention of the war on drugs as a political tool was cynical . . . \"). 237. Thus, the find ings and re commend ations of the Shafer Com mission were irrelevant to Con gress and the Nixon Admin istration, insofar as the pur pose of the CSA was never to \"pro tect\" people from the suppos ed \"scourge\" of Cannabis use, but rather to harass, intimidate, prosecute and ulti mately incarcerate those whom members of the Nixon Admin istration irrationally regarded as enemies. App. 220a 238. The irrationality of the Nixon Admin istra- tion's sup port for e nactment of the CSA and rejection of the Shafer Com mission's find ings and re commend - ations is fur ther revealed by tape recordings made by the former President of his Oval Office con versations. 239. Although osten sibly estab lished for the purpose of properly educating lawmakers about Cannabis with respect to the issue of scheduling or de - criminalization, 137 the Shafer Com mission was resigned by the Nixon Admin istration to the status of a bureaucratic, kangaroo court. 240. Nixon repeate dly made clear that the real purpose of the Shafer Com mission was to justify what he had already decided to do with respect to Cannabis, ultimately linking sup port for its decriminalization to Jews, whom Nixon irrationally claimed were mostly psychiat rists : NIXON : Now, this is one thing I want. I want a Goddamn strong state ment on marijuana. Can I get that out of this sonofabitching, uh Domestic Council? HALDERMAN : Sure. NIXON : I mean, one on marijuana that just tears the ass out of them. I see anothe r thing in the news sum mary this morning about it. You know, it's a funny thing \u2014every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana is Jewish. What the Christ is the matter with the Jews, Bob? What's the matter with them? I suppose it's because 137 H.R. Rep. 91 -1444 at 2111 (1970) ; CSDP, supra note 121 at 1. App. 221a most of them are psychiatrists, you know . . . .138 241. In Sep tember 1971, before his Com mission's report was issued, Raymond Shafer visited the White House to speak with Nixon about a morale problem he was experiencing on the Com mission\u2014specifically, that the members of the Shafer Com mission were con - cerned that it was \"put together by a President to merely tow the party line . . . \"139 242. In response, Nixon made abso lutely clear that he did not care what the Shafer Com mission's conclusions were. 140 243. During Shafer's meeting with Nixon, the latter pro ceeded to direct the Shafer Com mission to ignore the obvious differences between Cannabis, and heroin and other dangerous, addictive drugs : NIXON : I think there's a need to come o ut with a report that is totally, uh, uh, oblivious to some obvious, uh, differences between marijuana and other drugs, other dangerous drugs, there are differences. 141 244. When Shafer tried to assure Nixon that the Commission would not go \"off half -cocked,\" osten sibly promising to conclude that Cannabis should remain a Schedule I drug, along with drugs that act ually were 138 Tape Recording, May 26, 1971 (Con versation 505 -4). 139 Tape Recording, Sep tember 9, 1971 (Oval Office Con versa- tion No. 568 -4). 140 Id. 141 Id. App. 222a (and are) dangerous, Nixon responded tersely, \"Keep your Com mission in line!\" 142 245. Nixon threatened Shafer with public recri minations, asserting that con clusions con trary to Nixon's demands \"would make your Com mission just look as bad as hell.\" 143 246. Nixon's threats were not limited to Shafer and his Com mission. When Nixon became aware that Bertram Brown, then -direc tor of the National Institute of Mental Health, called for decriminalization of Cannabis, Nixon responded : Now, did you see this state ment by [Bertram] Brown, the National Institute of Mental Health, this morning? Uh, he should be out. I mean today, today. If he's a presidential appointee, [what we should] do is fire the son of bitch and I mean today! Get the son of a bitch out of here. 144 247. In that same con versation, Nixon also tied protesters to use of Cannabis : . . . these, uh, radical demonstrators that were here the last, . . . two weeks ago. They're all on drugs. Oh yeah, horrible, it's just a \u2014 when, I say \"all,\" virtually all. And uh, uh, just raising hell. 145 142 Id. 143 Id. 144 Tape Recording, May 18, 1971 (Oval Office Con versation No. 500-17). 145 Id. App. 223a 248. The so -called \"radical demonstrators\" to whom Nixon was referring were those opposed to the Vietnam War, which, at the time, deeply divided the Country. 249. When the Shafer Com mission issued its findings and re commend ations, which controverted the Nixon Admin istration's preordained con clusions and agenda against African Amer icans and war protesters, Nixon responded, predictably : Um, I met with Mr. Shafer, uh, I've read the report, uh, eh, it is a report that deserves consideration and will receive it. How ever, as to one aspect of the report I am in disagreement. I was before I read it, and reading it did not change my mind. Uh, I, uh, oppose the legalization of marijuana, and that includes the sale, its possession and its use. 146 250. If incarceration of antiwar protes tors and African Amer icans constitutes the measure of the War on Drugs' success, the Nixon Admin istration's efforts must be characterized as \"successful.\" Accord ing to the New York Daily News, \"by 1973, about 300,000 people were arrested under the la w [the CSA] \u2014the majority of whom were African Amer ican\" (Exh. 3). 251. The Nixon Admin istration's anti -Cannabis policies thus were manifested in two distinct, but related, efforts \u2014to usher the CSA through Con gress and then to use the law as a tool to incarcerate, harass 146 March 24, 1972 Press Conference (Oval Office Con versation No. 693 -01). App. 224a and undermine those whom members of the Nixon Admin istration considered hostile to their interests. 252. Those who opposed Nixon's agendas were cast aside, vilified or ignored. The Shafer Com mission's conclusions which co nflicted with Nixon's plans were treated similarly. III. The Evidence Confirms That, Despite the Lan - guage of the CSA and Nixon's Enforcement of It, the Federal Government Does Not and Has Never Believed That Cannabis Meets the Requirements of a Schedule I Drug 253. Under the CSA, drugs are classified by five Schedules, with Schedule I drugs identified as the most dangerous to human life, and Schedule V drugs regarded as the most benign. 254. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug under the CSA. 147 255. To meet the require ments of a Schedule I drug under the CSA, the following elements must all be met : 1. the drug has a high potential for abuse ; 2. the drug has \"no currently accepted med ical use in the United States ;\" and 3. there is a lack of accepte d safety for use of the drug even under med ical supervision. 148 147 21 C.F.R. 1308.11(d)(23) and (31) (wrongly listed as a hallucinogenic drug, along with heroin, mescaline and LSD). 148 Pub.

The Fed eral Gov ernment cannot genuinely believe that Cannabis meets the Three Schedule I Require ments. 258. Upon infor mation and belief, the Fed eral Government has never believed that Cannabis meets the Three Schedule I Require ments. The Federal Government Has Authorized Dispensing Medical Cannabis to Patients for More than 30 Years 259. In or about 1978, the United States began subsidizing a program pur suant to which med ical patients were pro vided with Cannabis, directly or indirectly, by th e Fed eral Gov ernment. 260. The aforesaid and described program, which exists to this day, is known as the Inves tigational New Drug Program (\"IND Program\"). 261. The first patient to receive Cannabis under the auspices of the IND Program was Robert R andall. 262. Upon infor mation and belief, Mr. Randall used med ical Cannabis pro vided under the auspices of the IND Program to treat his Glaucoma. 263. Thereafter, at least 12 other indi viduals par- ticipated in the IND Program and received Cannabis for treat ment of an assortment of diseases and conditions. App. 226a 264. Upon infor mation and belief, the Fed eral Government, as of the date of this filing, con tinues to sponsor and/or pro vide med ical Canna bis to patients pursuant to the IND Program. 265. Upon infor mation and belief, the number of patients currently receiving med ical Cannabis through the IND Program is eight. 266. Pursuant to the IND Program, the Fed eral Government has auth orized the Uni versity of Mississippi to harvest acres and acres of Cannabis. 267. Upon infor mation and belief, the acres of land harvested by Uni versity of Mississippi produce 50,000 to 60,000 Cannabis cigarettes per year . 268. Upon infor mation and belief, none of the patients who have par ticipated in the IND Program have suffered any serious side effects from their Cannabis treat ments. 269. Upon infor mation and belief, none of the patients who have par ticipated in the IND Program have suffered any harm from their Cannabis treat - ments. 270. Upon infor mation and belief, no Fed eral Agencies have ever collected any scientific data from the IND Program reflecting serious adverse impacts caused by Cannabis. 271. Upon infor mation and belief, the Fed eral Government does not have any infor mation suggesting that any of the patients who have par ticipated in the IND Program have ever suff ered any harm or serious side effects from their Cannabis treat ments.

All four patients who were the sub ject of the Missoula Study were stable with resp ect to their chronic conditions. 275.

Young, Concludes That Cannabis Safely Provides Medical Benefits to Patients with an Assortment of Illnesses Without Serious Side Effects 280. In 1988, Admin istrative Law Judge Francis Young, In the Matter of Marijuana Rescheduling, DEA Docket No. 86 -22, issued a de termination arising from a petition by the National Organ ization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (\"NORML\") to reschedule Cannabis (\"ALJ Deci sion\") (Exh. 281. In determining whether to re commend rescheduling Cannabis under the CSA, Judge Young focused on two issues \u2014(i) whether Cannabis \"has a currently accepted med ical use in treat ment in the United States, or a currently accepted med ical use with severe restrictions ;\" and (ii) \"whether there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the marijuana plant, even under med ical supervision\" (Id. at 6). 282. The two issues analyzed by Judge Young focus on the latter two of the Three Schedule I Require ments neces sary under the CSA to classify a drug as a \"Schedule I\" substance (Id. at 8 ; see also Pub. L. No. 91 -513, 84 Stat. 1247). 283. If a drug has no med ically -accepted use and cannot be safely used or tested even under med ical supervision, it may qual ify as a Schedule I drug ; if the drug does not meet either of these Schedule I Require - ments, it cannot be classified as a Schedule I drug (Id.). App. 229a 248. In resolving these issues, Judge Young made a series of \"find ings of Exh. 5) 285. The aforesaid and described find ings of fact by Judge Young were \"uncontroverted\" by the parties (ALJ Deci sion at 10, 54, 56, Exh. 5). 286. One of the aforesaid and described parties to the pro ceeding over which Judge Young presided was defend ant DEA (ALJ Deci sion at 10). 287. Judge Young thereafter devoted the next 15 pages of the ALJ Deci sion to evi dence adduced during the Cannabis consti - tutes a recog nized, well -accepted and superior method of treat ment of cancer patients suffering from nausea, emesis and wasting (Id. at 10 -25). 288. As part of his anal ysis, Judge Young cited to studies, patient histories, State legis lative find ings and other evi dence of the med ical efficacy of Cannabis (Id. at 10 -26). 289. The DEA did not attempt to dispute the facts upon which the aforesaid anal ysis by Judge Young was based (Id. at 26). 290. Judge Young concluded, based upon \"over - whelming\" evi dence, that : marijuana has a currently accepted med ical use in treat ment in the United States for nausea and vomiting result ing from chemo - theraphy treat ments in some cancer patients. To conclude otherwise, on this record, would be un reasonable, arbi trary and capricious (Id. at 34). App. 230a 291. Judge Young pro ceeded to analyze the record with respect to the use of med ical Cannabis for the treat ment of mul tiple sclerosis, spasticity and hyper - parathyroidism (Id. at 40 -54). 292. After reviewing the extensiv e record, Judge Young concluded : [Marijuana has a currently accepted med ical use in treat ment in the United States for spasticity result ing from mul tiple sclerosis and other causes. It would be un reasonable, arbitrary and capricious to find otherwise (Id. at 54). 293. The DEA did not attempt to dispute the facts comprising the \"extensive record\" upon which Judge Young relied in reaching the aforesaid and described conclusion pertaining to the med ical efficacy of Cannabis for the treat ment of spasticity result ing from mul tiple sclerosis and other causes. 294. Judge Young similarly concluded that med ical Cannabis pro vides therapeutic benefits to those suffering from hyperparathyroidism (Id. at 54 -55). 295. The DEA did not attempt to dispute the facts comprising the \"extensive record\" upon which Judge Young relied in reaching the aforesaid and described conclusion pertaining to the med ical efficacy of Cannabis for the treat ment of hyperparathyroidism. 296. After concluding that Cannabis does, in fact, have currently -accepted med ical uses, Judge Young turned to the issue of whether it may be used or tested safely under med ical supervision \u2014the third of the Three Schedule I Require ments (Id. at 56). App. 231a 297. After reviewing the uncontroverted evi dence , Judge Young ruled in a series of enu merated para - graphs that, not only is Cannabis not dangerous ; it is extraordinarily safe. In this regard, Judge Young ruled : 4. Nearly all medicines have toxic, potent ially lethal effects. But marijuana is not such a substance. There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, doc u- mented cannabis -induced fatality . 5. This is a remarkable state ment. First, the record on marijuana encompasses 5,000 years of human experience. Second, marijuana is now used daily by enormous numbers of people throughout the world. Estimates suggest that from 20 million to 50 million Amer icans routinely, albeit illegally, smoke marijuana without the benefit of direct med - ical supervision. Yet, despite this long history of use and the extraordinarily high numbers of social smokers, there are simply no credible med ical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a single death . 6. By contrast, aspirin, a commonly -used, over - the-counter medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year . Id. at 56 -57 (emphasis added). 298. Judge Young found that, to induce a lethal response to Cannabis, the patient would be re quired to consume approx imately 1,500 pounds of marijuana within 15 minutes \u2014an amount and time frame which, App. 232a as a practical matter, are com plete ly unrealistic (Id. at 57). 299. Judge Young thereafter concluded that : In strict med ical terms, marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume (Id. at 58) (emphasis added). 300. If these find ings were not suf ficiently damn - ing to the CSA's mis -classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, Judge Young made it even more clear when he wrote : Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of med ical care . Id. at 58 -59 (emphasis added). 301. Judge Young thereafter re commended that Cannabis be removed from Schedule I of the CSA (Id. at 66). 302. The DEA did not accept Judge Young's find- ings or re commend ation. 303. The ALJ's Deci sion was issued years before 29 Stat es and the Dis trict of Columbia legalized Cannabis for med ical use ; before eight States plus the District of Columbia legalized Cannabis for recrea tional use; before two U.S. Territories approved the use of whole -plant Cannabis. States Begin to Legalize Cannabis 304. In 1996, California became the first State to legalize Cannabis for med ical use. App. 233a 305. Oregon, Alaska and Washington (State) followed soon thereafter and also legalized Cannabis for med ical use. 306. Today, the following States ha ve legalized Cannabis for med ical and/or recreational use : California Oregon Alaska Washington (State) Maine Hawaii Colorado Nevada Montana Vermont New Mexico Michigan New Jersey Arizona Massachusetts New York Maryland Minnesota Florida Delaware App. 234a Ohio Pennsylvania Illinois North Dakota Arkansas Connecticut New Hampshire Rhode Island West Virginia 307. In addi tion to the States, the following terri - tories, pro tectorates and other areas un der United States juris diction have legalized Cannabis for med ical and/or recreational uses : Washington, DC 150 Puerto Rico Guam 308. The method of legalization of Cannabis by States and other areas within Fed eral juris diction has 150 Although initially barring Washington, DC from imple menting a med ical Cannabis program in or about 1998, Con gress took no action to prevent enactment of a med ical legalization program in our Nation's Capitol in 2011. Thus, Washington , DC was able to institute a med ical Cannabis program in 2011. Thereafter, in 2014, Washington, DC approved a decriminalization program for Cannabis. Al though sub jected to a mandatory 30 -day review period to be undertaken by Con gress under the Dis trict of Colum bia Home Rule Act, Congress took no action . Thus, al though afforded the oppor tunity to stop imple mentation of Washington, DC's decriminalization program, Con gress decided not to do so. App. 235a varied from State con stitutional amend ment, to legis - lative enactment, to voters' referenda. 309. Today, more than 62% of Amer icans live within a juris diction in which Cannabis is legal to consume for med ical and/or other pur poses. 310. California, the world's sixth largest econ omy, has legalized Cannabis for recreational pur poses as well. 311. State -legal Cannabis has been avail able to millions of Amer icans for decades. 312. Cannabis has been avail able illegally (i.e., on the \"blac k market\") to millions of Amer icans for approx imately 100 years. 313. Upon infor mation and belief, no credible medical report has confirmed a single fatality in the United States from the consumption of Cannabis. 314. By contrast, the follow ing \"legal\" substances have caused the following number of deaths in the United States on an annual basis : (a) tobacco -480,000 deaths per year ;151 (b) alcohol \u201488,000 deaths per year ;152 (c) acetaminophe n\u20141,500 deaths from 2001 to 2010. 154 The Federal Government Admits and Obtains a Medical Patent Based Upon its Assertion That Cannabis Provides Medical Benefits 315. In or about 1999, the United States Gov ern- ment filed a patent appli cation, entitled : (capitalization underscoring eral Government made r epresentations to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") relative to the effects of Cannabis on the human body (Id.). 317. In the U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli cation, the Fed that Cannabis pro vides med ical benefit to, and thus has med ical uses for, patients suffering with an assortment of diseases and conditions. In this regard, the Fed eral Gov ernment asserted that : Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant propertie s, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found prop erty makes cannabinoids useful in the treat ment 154 http ://wwwhuffingtonpost. com. 2013/ 09/24/tylenol -overdose_ n_3976991. html. This does not include the 78,000 Amer icans who are rushed to emergency rooms annually, or the 33,000 hos - pitalizations in the United States each year, all due to ingestion of acetaminophen. Id. App. 237a and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age - related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The can nabinoids are found to have particular appli cation as neuropro tectants, for example, in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treat ment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and HIV Dementia (Id. at Abstract). 318. In sup port of its U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli - cation, the Fed eral Gov ernment cited a series of studies and academic papers, which, the Fed eral Gov ernment repre sents, sup port its con clusion that Cannabis does, in fact, pro vide med ical benefits, including conditions which are listed and which are not listed on the U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli cation (Id.). 319. The U.S. Cannabis unmistakably Government's con tinued classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, which, it is emphasized, re quires a finding that it lacks any med ical use. 320. Simply put \u2014the Fed eral Gov ernment cannot maintain, on its U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli cation, that Cannabis does, in fact, have curative properties that pro vide med ical benefits to patients suffering from an assortment of diseases while also simulta neously \"finding\" that Cannabis has no med ical 238a whatsoever for pur poses of appli cation and enforce - ment of the CSA. 155 The Justice Department Issues Guidelines for Prose - cution of Medical Cannabis Patients (2009) 321. As State -legal Cannabis legislation and othe r approvals of med ical Cannabis con tinued to pass throughout the United States, the Fed eral Gov ernment was confronted with a problem \u2014under the CSA, the cultivation, harvesting, extraction, distribution, sale and/or use of Cannabis was (and is) illegal ; however, States were granting their citizens per mission to cultivate, distribute, sell, and/or use Cannabis for medical pur poses. 322. On or about Oct ober 19, 2009, defend ant DOJ, while professing the importance of enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis, ack nowledged the existence of State laws authorizing the use of \"med ical marijuana,\" and di rected that United States Attor - neys : should not focus fed eral resources in your States on indi viduals whose actions are in clear an d unambiguous compliance with existing State laws pro viding for the med ical use of marijuana. For example, pros ecution of indi viduals with cancer or other serious illnesses who use marijuana as part of a re - commended treat ment regimen con sistent with applicable State law, or those caregivers in clear and unambiguous compliance with 155 Because the U.S. Cannabis Patent was granted by the USPTO, the Fed eral Gov ernment is estopped from contesting the assertions con tained in its Appli cation. App. 239a existing state pro vide such indi vid- uals with marijuana, is unlikely to be an efficient use of limited fed eral resources. See October 19, 2009 Me morandum by Deputy Attor ney General of the United States, David W. Ogden (\"Ogden Memo randum\"), Exh. 7. 323. Thus, not with stand ing the provisions of the CSA, prohibiting cultivation, distribution, sale, pos- session and/or use of Cannabis, as a drug so dangerous that it cannot be tested under strict med ical super - vision, the DOJ expressly discouraged United States Attor neys from using fed eral resources to prosecute violations of the CSA by users of Cannabis for med ical purposes in State -legal juris dictions. The Justice Department Adopts the Cole Memorandum 324. On or about August 29, 2013, defend ant DOJ promulgated what has come to be known as the \"Cole Memo randum\" (Exh. 8). 325. Under the Cole Memo randum, the DOJ, con - sistent wi th the Ogden Memo randum, officially recog - nized that patients using State -legal -medical Cannabis, in accordance with the laws of the States in which they reside, and busi nesses cultivating and/or selling State -legal Cannabis for med ical pur poses, a re not appro priate targets for fed eral inves tigation, pros - ecution and incarceration (Id. at 3). 326. The net effect of the Cole Memo randum was to inform med ical-Cannabis busi nesses operating in accordance with the laws of the States in which such businesses operate, and patients who use med ical Cannabis in accordance with the laws of the States in which such patients reside, that they would not be App. 240a prosecuted, pro vided that such Cannabis busi nesses and med ical Cannabis patients did not engage in conduct which encroached upon eight (8) spe cific fed - eral priorities, identified in the Cole Memo randum as follows : 1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors ; 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of mari - juana from going to criminal enter prises, gangs, and cartels ; 3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from States where it is legal under State law in some form to other States ; 4. Preventing State -auth orized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for th e trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity ; 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of mari - juana ; 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exac - erbation of other adverse public health consequence s allegedly asso ciated with mari - juana use; 7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the supposed attendant public safety and en viron mental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands ; and 8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal prop erty. See Cole Memo randum, Exh. 8. App. 241a The Treasury Department Provides Federal Authori- zation to Banks to Transact with Cannabis Businesses 327. On Feb ruary 14, 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforce ment Network (\"FinCEN\") issued a Memo ran- dum pro viding gui dance to clarify Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") expectations for financial institutions seeking to pro vide services to marijuana -related businesses (\"FinCen Gui dance\") (Exh. 9 at 1). 328. FinCEN issued the FinC EN Gui dance \"in light of recent state initiatives to legalize certain marijuana -related activity and related gui dance by the DOJ [i.e., the Cole Memo randum] con cerning marijuana -related enforce ment priorities\" (Id.). 329. In essence, the FinCEN Gui dance was the Treasury Depart ment' s own version of the Cole Memo randum, except that the FinCEN Gui dance was sent to private actors (banks and other financial institutions), informing them how it is that they can transact with Cannabis busi nesses \u2014businesses that are technically illegal under the CSA. 330. FinCEN pro vides gui dance and advice to banks and other financial institutions con cerning how they can engage in conduct which is illegal under the CSA, as well as under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 (laundering of monetary instruments). 331. By the FinCEN Gui dance, the Treasury Depart ment pro vided, inter alia, the following in - struc tions on how to transact with Cannabis busi - nesses : The Financial Crimes Enforce ment Network [ ] is issuing gui dance to clarify Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") expectations for financial App. 242a institu tions busi nesses. FinCEN is issuing this gui dance in light of recent state initiatives to legalize certain marijuana - related activity and related gui dance by the U.S. Depart ment of Justice (\"DOJ\") concern- ing marijuana -related enforce ment priorities. This FinCEN gui dance clarifies how financial institutions can pro vide services to marijuana - related busi nesses consistent with their BSA obligations, and aligns the information pro - vided by financial institutions in BSA reports with fed eral and state law enforce ment priorities. This FinCEN gui dance should enhance the availability of financial servi ces for, and the financial transparency of, marijuana -related busi nesses . See FinCEN Gui dance at 1 (Exh. 9) (emphasis added). 332. Under the provisions of the FinCEN Gui - dance, the Fed eral Gov ernment pro vided authoriza - tion to banks and other financial institutions to transact with Cannabis busi nesses. 333. Under the provisions of the FinCEN Gui- dance, the Treasury Depart ment di rected that financial institutions, prior to engaging in trans actions with med ical Cannabis busi nesses, under take due dil- igence to ascertain whether the latter are operating in conformity with the provisions of the Cole Memo ran- dum (Id.). 334. The Ogden Memo randum, Cole Memo randum and FinCEN Gui dance each state, in form and sub - stance, that the CSA has not been super seded and App. 243a remains in effect ; however, each aforesaid Memo ran- dum/ Guidance makes equally clear that the United States Gov ernment should not interfere with State - legal med ical-Cannabis busi nesses, and should not otherwise enforce the CSA as against such businesses or the patients who use the products cultivated and dispensed by such busi nesses, pro vided that all such businesses and patients act in conform ity with the laws of the States in which such busi nesses operate and in which such patients reside. 335. The 2009 Ogden Memo randum, 2013 Cole Memo randum and 2014 FinCEN Gui dance cannot be reconciled with the Fed eral Gov ernment's classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug that is so dangerous that it has no med ical pur pose and cannot be tested even under strict med ical supervision. The United States Surgeon General Acknowledges Medical Benefits of Cannabis Use/The DEA Removes a Series of False Statements Concerning Cannabis from its Website 336. On or about Fe bruary 4, 2015, the then - United States Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, appeared on CBS This Morning, a nationally -televised daily talk show. 337. While on CBS This Morning, the U.S. Sur- geon General publicly acknowledged that Cannabis can safely pro vide bonafide med ical benefits to patients (\"Surgeon General's Ack nowledgment\"). 338. The DEA, earlier this year, removed from its website : all refer ences to Cannabis as a supposed \"gateway drug ;\" as a drug that ca uses \"permanent App. 244a brain damage ;\" and as a drug that leads to psychosis (\"DEA's Website Revision\"). 339. The DEA's Website Revision is con sistent with the Surgeon General's Ack nowledgment. 340. Prior to the DEA' s Website Revision, a petition was filed o n behalf of Amer icans for Safe Access, alleging that the DEA's website false infor mation (\"ASA Petition\") (Exh. 341. Petition filed under the Infor - mation Quality Act (\"IQA\") (Id.). 342. Under the IQA, Fed eral Agencies are re quired to devise guide lines to ensure the \"quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of infor mation\" they disse mi- nate. 156 343. These require ments are designed to ensure that, inter alia, the infor mation con tained on the websites maintained by Fed eral Agencies is accurate. 344. Upon infor mation and belief, it was in response to the ASA Petition, asserting that the infor - mation con tained on the DEA website was inaccurate, that the DEA effected its Website Revision. In other words, the DEA, rather than litigating the inaccuracy of the infor mation con tained on its website, changed that infor mation and effected its Website Revision in recognition that the lan guage asserting that Cannabis is a supposed \"gateway drug\" that causes psychosis and permanent brain damage was and is false. 157 156 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3516, Stat utory and Historical Notes. 157 The FDA also removed all refer ences to Cannabis as a supposed \"gateway drug\" on its website. App. 245a Congress Precludes the DOJ from Using Legislative Appropriations to Prosecute State -Legal Cannabis Cultivation, Distribution, Sale and Use 345. In Decem ber 2014, Con gress enacted a rider to an omnibus appropriations bill, funding the Fed eral Government through Sep tember 30, 2015 (\"2014 Funding Rider\"). 346. Under the 2014 Funding Rider, Con gress expressly prohibited the DOJ from using the appro - priations pro vided there by to prosecute the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of med ical Cannabis in States where such activ ities are legal. 347. The 2014 Funding Rider includes the follow - ing language : None of th e funds made avail able in this Act to the Depart ment of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Dis trict of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mar yland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Wash - ington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from imple menting their own State laws that auth orize the use, distribution, pos - session, or cultivation of med ical marijuana. See Consolidated and Fur ther Continuing Appro - priations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 113 -235, \u00a7 538, 128 Stat. 2130, 2217 (2014). App. 246a 348. The States r eferenced in the 2014 Funding Rider are those that, as of the date of the 2014 Funding Rider, had estab lished State -legal med ical Cannabis programs. 349. Various short -term measures extended the 2014 Funding Rider through Decem ber 22, 2015. 350. On De cember 18, 2015, Con gress enacted a new appropriations act, which appro priated funds through the fiscal year ending Sep tember 30, 2016, and included essentially the same rider as the 2014 Funding Rider. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -113, \u00a7 542, 129 Stat. 2242, 2332 -33 (2015) (adding Guam and Puerto Rico and changing \"prevent such States from imple menting their own State laws\" to \"prevent any of them from imple menting their own laws\"). 351. In 2017, Con gress enacted another rider, updating the 2014 Funding Rider to include the States that added med ical-Cannabis programs over the preceding three years, and again restricting the use of Con gressional appropriations to prosecute only those vio lations of the CSA in which th e defend ants cultivate, distribute, and/or sell Cannabis in a manner that violates State -legal med ical marijuana programs (\"2017 Funding Rider\"). In this regard, the 2017 Funding Rider states : None of the funds made avail able in this Act to the Depart ment of Justice may be used, with respect to any of the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mass achusetts , App. 247a Michi gan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsyl - vania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennes - see, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wash - ington, West Virg inia, Wisconsin, and Wyo - ming, or with respect to the Dis trict of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico, to prevent any of them from imple menting their own laws that auth orize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of med ical mari - juana. See Cons olidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. 115 -31, \u00a7 537 (2017). IV. Summary of the Allegations and Evidence That the Federal Government Does Not and Cannot Believe That Cannabis Meets the Three Schedule I Requirements 352. The net effect of the foregoing allegations and evi dence confirms beyond serious ques tion that the Fed eral Gov ernment does not and cannot believe that Cannabis : (i) has no med ical use, and (ii) cannot be used or tested even under strict med ical supervision. Indeed, it bears emphasis that Cannabis : has been widely used as a legal medication for more than 10,000 years, including by the Founding Fathers of this Country ; was legal until the end of Prohibition threatened to leave Anslinger without any responsibilities ; was found by the Shafer Com mission to be safe enough to decriminalize for personal use ; App. 248a has been dispensed by the Fed eral Gov ernment to participants in the IND Program for more than 30 years without evi dence of harm to any of the patients ; was found by ALT Young to be the safest drug avail able in the world, based upon evi dence that the DEA never attempted to contest ; has been used continuously as part of State - legal programs for med ical pur poses throughout the United States, beginning in 1996 ; has been avail able to millions of Amer icans on a daily basis for decades without a single fatality \u2014a record that neither coffee nor aspirin can claim ; is the sub ject of the successful U.S. Cann abis Patent Appli cation, in which the Fed eral Gov - ernment admit ted (indeed, bragged) that Cannabis pro vides safe, med ical benefits to patients suffering from an assortment of illnesses, diseases and conditions ; was identified by the U.S. Surgeon General as having med ical benefits -a con clusion that has been separately reached by doctors, scientists, and academics during the course of conducting thousands of studies and tests ; cannot be the sub ject of a fed eral criminal pros - ecution under the CSA unless cultivated, distributed, sold or used in vio lation of State law; and is the sub ject of estab lished fed eral policy which recognizes the med ical benefits of Cannabis. App. 249a 353. Indeed, the notion that the Fed eral Gov ern- ment p ersists in classifying Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, while ignoring the undeniable addictive and lethal chemical properties of nicotine and tar, and alcohol, which kill millions of Amer icans every year, renders this misclassification of Cannabis utterly irrational and absurd. V. The Petitioning Process Is Illusory and Futile Prior Petitions to Re -Schedule and/or De -Schedule Cannabis 354. Under the CSA, members of the public are afforded the supposed oppor tunity to file petitions to request that medications and drugs be re -scheduled and/or de -scheduled. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308. 355. The legal mechanism avail able to the public to file petitions to change the classification of drugs and medications pre viously scheduled under the auspices of the CSA is illusory. Petitions filed with the DEA and/or any other Fed eral agency linger for years, often decades, without any sub stantive action. 356. The following chart of petitions filed with the DEA, reflects the futility of the petitioni ng process : Requested Action Transfer any injectable liquid con taining Pentazocine (opioid derivative) from Schedule V to Schedule III Type of Petitioner(s) 7 Indi viduals App. 250a Date Filed 10/5/1971 Date Decided 1/10/1979 Delay 8 years Outcome Denied Requested Action Remove Cannabis from Schedule I or transfer to Schedule V Type of Petitioner(s) NORML, Cannabis Corporation of America (CCA) ; Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) ; Individuals Date Filed 5/18/72 Date Decided 3/26/92 Delay 20 years Outcome Denied Requested Action Transfer Cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule II Type of Petitioner(s) Individual Date Filed 9/6/92 Date Decided 5/16/94 Delay N/A App. 251a Outcome DEA declined to accept the filing of the petition Requested Action Transfer Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III Type of Petitioner(s) UNIMED Pharmaceutica Is Inc.

Excluding the petitions which are either still pending or were never decided at all (because they were rejected based upon stand ing or other grounds), the average delay from filing a petition to reschedule a drug under the CSA to the date of the petition's resolution is approx imately nine (9) years. 358. Persons seeking to re -classify a Schedule I drug or medication based upon an urgent med ical need, including and especially, Alexis and Jagger, are resigned to waiting until osten sibly the drug would no longer serve any useful pur pose, because the illness, disease and/or condition has resolved or the patient has died. 359. The petitioning process is a hollow remedy. 360. Worse than the entrenched, systemic delays imposed by the Fed eral Gov ernment is the institutional bias of gov ernment offici als which all but assures denial of enced supra , in Novem ber 2015, defend ant Rosenberg of the defend ant DEA, which is responsible for responding to petitions to reclassify drugs under the CSA, publicly asserted that med ical Cannabis is \"a joke\" \u2014essentially pre -judging any petition to re -schedule or de -schedule Cannabis. 362. As reported by Politico, defend ant Sessions, \"[a]s a U.S. Attor ney in Alabama in the 1980s, [ ] said he thought the KKK 'were [sic] OK until I found out they smoked pot.''' App. 256a 363. On Decem ber 5, 2016, Politico reported that, in April 2016, defend ant Sessions dis closed that he believes that : \"Good people don't smoke m arijuana.\" 364. As the Attor ney General of the United States, defend ant Sessions would have the oppor tunity to reclassify Cannabis ; however, as with defend ant Rosenberg, defend ant Sessions has pre -judged the issue. 365. Upon infor mation and belief, Rosenberg did not review any med ical or scientific studies prior to asserting, in or about Novem ber 2015, that med ical Cannabis is a joke. 366. Upon infor mation and belief, Sessions did not review any med ical or scientific studies prior to issuing his state ment in the 1980s, in which he said that he thought the KKK \"were [sic] OK until I found out they smoked pot.\" 367. Upon infor mation and belief, Sessions did not review any med ical or scientific studies prior to issuing his state ment on or about Decem ber 5, 2016 that \"Good people don't smoke marijuana.\" 368. Upon infor mation and belief, defend ants Sessions and Rosenberg, in condemning med ical Cannabis and those who re commend and/or use it, were not speaking from experience or an in -depth medical or scientific under stand ing of the chemical properties of Cannabis and its impact on the body's metabolic systems and processes ; nor were their assertions the product of an anal ysis con cerning whether med ical Cannabis has been accepted by the medical community. Rather, the opinions of defend ants Sessions and Rosenberg are based upon political (not scientific) distinctions made by a diminishing minority App. 257a of vocal public officials who, without conducting an y scientific review or anal ysis, assume that any conduct associated with Cannabis is necessarily dangerous and otherwise bad based upon un constitutional criteria. 369. The unconscionable delays in processing petitions, coupled with the institution al bias at the DOJ and DEA against re -classifying Cannabis, renders the petitioning process illusory and futile. In short, the Fed eral Gov ernment does not pro vide real \"due process\" to those aggrieved by the misclassification of Cannabis under the CSA . This lawsuit is the only mechanism by which patients in need of med ical Cannabis can law fully and without risk of pros ecution safely obtain and use it. 370. Even assuming arguendo that the petitioning process were not futile \u2014and it is \u2014it would not pro - vide a meaningful remedy for Plain tiffs insofar as the petition process : (i) cannot resolve the sub stantial con- stitutional issues which Defend ants have repeatedly declined to address in a manner con sistent with the provisions of the Unite d States Con stitution; and (ii) cannot pro vide Plain tiffs with a genuine oppor tunity for adequate relief (spe cifically, a dec laration that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, is unconstitutional), insofar as the relief requested herein is beyond the author ity of Defend ants DEA, DOJ, Sessions and/or Rosenberg. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs ) 371. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-370, as if set forth fully herein. App. 258a 372. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment, no person may be \"deprived of life, liberty or prop erty without due process of law\" (\"Due Process Clause\"). 373. Under well -estab lished con stitutional jurisprudence, laws which are not rationally related to a legit imate interest of the Fed eral Gov ernment violate the Due Process Clause. 374. The CSA classifies drugs into five scheduled categories\u2014Schedule I, Schedule II, Schedule HI, Schedule IV, and Schedule V. 158 375. Cannabis has been classified as a Schedule I drug, along with, among others, heroin, mescaline, and LSD. As such, under the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis, the cultivation, distribution, prescription, sale, and/or use of Cannabis constitutes a vio lation of Federal Law, sub jecting those accused of such a crime to pros ecution and incarceration. 376. The stated basis for enactment and imple - mentation of the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis was that the drug meets the Three Schedule I Requirements, i.e.: 1. the drug has a high potential for abuse ; 2. the drug has \"no currently accepted med ical use in the United States ;\" and 3. there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug even under med ical supervision. 159 158 Pub. L. No. 91 -513, 84 Stat. 1247. 159 Id. App. 259a 377. In view of the facts and evi dence set forth above and summarized below, the Fed eral Gov ernment does not believe that Cannabis meets the aforemen - tioned Three Schedule I Require ments. 378. Cannabis has been cultivated and used as a medication for thousands of years. 379. Cannabis was cultivated and used as a medication in Colonial America and in post -Colonial America, including by the Framers of our Con stitution. 380. Cannabis was cultivated and used throughout the 19th Century, during which it was one of America's three leading crops for cultivation. 381. Cannabis was listed in prominent pharma - cological publications throughout the second half of the 19th Century and the beginning of the 20th Century as a medication that treats d ozens of diseases and conditions. 382. The Shafer Com mission confirmed that Can - nabis is not dangerous and should be decriminalized for personal use. 383. Since in or about 1978, the Fed eral Gov- ernment has been continuously dispensing and/or authorizing the dispensing of Cannabis to between at least 8 to 13 patients for the treat ment of an assortment of diseases, illnesses and med ical conditions. 384. In 1988, ALJ Francis Young, after a review of the uncontroverted med ical evi dence, concluded that Cannabis pro vides med ical benefits to patients, none of whom have been endangered by it (Exh. 5). App. 260a 385. Beginning in 1996, States throughout the Country have instituted med ical and recreational Cannabis programs without fed eral inter vention. 386. Today, more than 62% of the Amer ican public resides in States in which whole -plant Cannabis is legal for med ical and/or recreational pur poses ; thus, millions of Amer icans have the oppor tunity to use Cannabis on a daily basis. 387. Upon infor mation and belief, there have never been any doc umented deaths in the United States due to the consumption of Cannabis. 388. Since 2009, the DOJ has consistently di rected its U.S. Attor neys to refrain from prosecuting patients, physicians -and busi nesses involved in the use, culti va- tion and/or sale of Cannabis if the same is consistent with State -legal med ical-Cannabis programs (Exhs. 8 and 9). 389. Since 2014, the Treasury Depart ment has auth orized banking and other financial institutions to engage in trans actions with Cannabis busi nesses that act in conformity with State -legal med ical-Cannabis programs (Exh. 9). 390. For the last three years, Con gress has de - funded the DEA and DOJ from prosecuting indi viduals and busi nesses engaging in conduct that is con sistent with State -legal med ical-Cannabis programs. 391. In or about 2002, the United States Gov ern- ment repeatedly asserted in its U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli cation that, based upon a series of scientific studies, Cannabis has accepted med ical uses for the treat ment of brain diseases and disorders (Exh. 6). App. 261a 392. After obtaining a U.S. Cannabis Patent, the Federal Gov ernment executed license agreements to private busi nesses to engage in med ical Cannabis cultivation and extraction. 393. While the Fed eral Gov ernment may conceiv - ably argue that the initial and con tinued classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug is neces sary because of its alleged high potential for abuse, supposed lack of med ical use, and pur ported risks of potential harm to those who use it even under med ical supervision, the foregoing history confirms that the United Stat es Gov ernment does not believe the story it is telling. 394. Based upon the foregoing, the Fed eral Gov - ernment, not only does not believe that Cannabis meets the Three Schedule I Require ments of the CSA, but fur ther, upon infor mation and belief, n o rational person could reasonably believe that it meets such Require ments. 395. There is no credible evi dence that Cannabis has a high potential for abuse. 396. There is no credible evi dence that Cannabis lacks any med ical benefit ; to the con trary, the overwhelming weight of evi dence confirms that Cannabis has, for millennia, from Ancient Chinese and Egyptian societies, to our Founding Fathers, to modern -day America, pro vided sub stantial med ical benefits to the patients who h ave been treated with medical Cannabis. 397. There is no credible evi dence that Cannabis poses a serious risk of harm when used under med ical supervision ; to the con trary, the overwhelming weight of evi dence confirms that, al though virtually all App. 262a medications have some toxic, potentially lethal effects, \"marijuana is not such a substance\" (ALJ Deci sion at 56, Exh. 5). And no one in the United States has ever died from using Cannabis (Id.).160 398. Because Cannabis does not meet the criteria required for classification of a Schedule I drug and is, in fact, safe for use, and because the Fed eral Gov ern- ment is fully aware of the foregoing but nonetheless insists upon continuing the misclassification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, the CSA and its imple - mentation is irrational, arbi trary, capricious and is not rationally related to any legit imate gov ernment interest. 399. The only credible ex planation for the enact - ment of the CSA and its subse quent and continuing enforce ment by the Fed eral Gov ernment lies in the politically -repressive, xenophobic and racial animus described by John Ehrlichman and other members of the Nixon Admin istration\u2014an animus proscribed by the Con stitution of the United States. 400. As set forth above, the petitioning process for drug scheduling does not constitute \"due process\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amend ment to the Constitution, insofar as the petition process : (i) is rife with un constitutional delays that render review imprac - ticable for the Plain tiffs {and most med ical Cannabis patients) ; (ii) is rife with institutional bias, by which a vocal minority of public officials refuse to consider the overwhelming weight of med ical evi dence estab - lishing that Cannabis pro vides safe med ical benefits ; (iii) cannot resolve the sub stantial con stitutional issues which Defend ants have repeatedly declined to 160 This allegation does not include refer ence to those who may have used black -market synthetic Cannabis. App. 263a address in a manner con sistent with the provisions of the United States Co nstitution; and (iv) cannot pro vide Plain tiffs with a genuine oppor tunity for adequate relief, insofar as the relief requested re quires cor recting an Act of Con gress which is beyond the author ity of Defend ants DEA, DOJ, Sessions and/or Rosenberg. 401. Alexis, Jose, and Jagger need med ical Canna bis for the treat ment of their diseases and conditions, but cannot safely use it without risking their freedom or other rights to which they are legally and con stitutionally entitled. Wash ington desires to open a Cannabis busi ness through the use of the MBE Program, but cannot do so, as he would be ineligible to receive such benefits and would be risking potential incarceration were he to file the required paperwork for MBE benefits. The C CA seeks, on behalf of its membership, termination of disproportionate enforce ment of the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis against persons of color. Defend - ants maintain, not with stand ing the overwhelming weight of the evi dence in the record (including state - ments made by the Fed eral Gov ernment itself that Cannabis has curative properties and is safe), that Cannabis is somehow an addictive, dangerous and lethal drug on par with heroin, mescaline and LSD without any med ical benefits whatsoever and thus must remain illegal and con tinue to be enforced in the manner prac ticed today. 402. Meanwhile, substances that undeniably pro - vide no med ical benefit whatsoever, are highly addictive and cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per ye ar, including for example, tobacco, remain widely avail able and un -scheduled under the CSA. App. 264a 403. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiffs and Defend ants, by which Plain tiffs need and/or desire to use and/or engage in busi ness trans - actions involving Cannabis, whereas Defend ants falsely and un constitutionally maintain that possession and use of Cannabis is lethally dangerous and thus must remain illegal. 404. By reason of the foregoing, Plain tiffs are entitled to issuance of an order and judg ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, is irrational, arbi trary, capricious and not rationally related to any legit imate gov ernmental interest, and thus un constitutional; and (ii) permanently enjoining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA. 405. Plain tiffs have no remedy at law. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of the CCA Only ) 406. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-405, as if set forth fully herein. 407. The United States Supreme Court has con - sistently held that dis crim ination may be so unjustifiable as to constitute a vio lation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment. 161 408. The mis -classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug under the CSA was effectuated in an environment tainted by racial dis crim ination and 161 Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234 -35 (1979) ; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638 n. 2 (1975) ; Cruz v. Hauck, 404 U.S. 59, 62 n. 10 (1971) ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954). App. 265a animus, hostile to the interests of African Amer icans and other persons of color. 409. The CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, was imple mented in an environment tainted by racial dis - crim ination and animus, hostile to the interests of African Amer icans and other persons of color. 410. The CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, has been enforced in a mariner r eflective of racial dis crim - ination and animus, hostile to the interests of African Amer icans and other persons of color. 411. Although Cannabis is consumed and used equally by African Amer icans and White Amer icans, African Amer icans are the CSA. 412. Upon infor mation and belief, the racial animus underwriting the mis -classification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug under the CSA continues to this day, result ing in con victions and the incarceration of African Amer icans and other persons of color in disproportionate numbers. 413. The misclassification of Cannabis as a Schedule I drug under the CSA was also intended to suppres s the First Amend ment rights and interests of those protesting the Vietnam War, including such rights as freedom of speech and the right to petition the gov ernment for a redress of grievances. 414. Upon infor mation and belief, the Fed eral Government tactically enforced the CSA against war protesters and persons of color insofar as members of the Nixon Admin istration irrationally believed such persons to be enemies of America's war on communism. App. 266a 415. In enacting and disproportionately enforcing the CSA against persons of color, the Fed eral Gov ern- ment violated, and con tinues to violate, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment and the require ments of Equal Pro tection. 416. In enacting and disproportionately enforcing the CSA against those protesting the Vietnam War, the Fed eral Gov ernment violated, and con tinues to violate, the First Amend ment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment and the require ments of Equal Pro tection. 417. The Fed eral Gov ernment lacks a com pelling interest in the enactment of a statute that dis criminates against persons of color, and violates and has violated the First and Fifth Amend ment rights of members of the CCA, and the ir rights to Equal Pro tection, 418. Upon infor mation and belief, even assuming arguendo that the Fed eral Gov ernment were to have a com pelling interest in enacting and enforcing the CSA in the manner herein described, the CSA is not narrowly tailored to satisfy and achieve that com pelling interest (what ever it might be). 419. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiff CCA o n the one hand, and Defend ants on the other, by which the CCA maintains that the CSA was enacted on the basis of racism and political suppression of the rights guaranteed under the First Amend ment, and enforced in a manner that is so dis - crim inatory a s to rise to the level of a vio lation of Due Process and Equal Pro tection, whereas Defend ants irrationally and un constitutionally maintain that the CSA constitutes a valid exer cise of fed eral power. App. 267a 420. By reason of the foregoing, the CCA is entitled to issuance of an order and judg ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, violates the rights of its members under the First and Fifth Amend ments to the United States Constitution and under principles of Equal Pro tection. 421. CCA has no remedy at law. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs except Washington) 422. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-421, as if set forth fully herein. 423. Freedom to travel through out the United States, including between and among States of the Union, has long been recog nized as a basic right under the Con stitution. 162 424. Alexis re quires med ical Cannabis to preserve and sustain her life, but cannot travel with med ical Cann abis without risking pros ecution, incarceration, and/or the loss of other liberty rights and interests. 425. Dean cannot travel without his wife, who, as Alexis's caregiver, cannot leave Alexis alone ; thus, Dean cannot safely travel either. 426. Jagger re quires med ical Cannabis to live without excruciating pain and to avoid death, but cannot travel with med ical Cannabis without risking prosecution, incarceration, and/or the loss of other libert y rights and interests. 162 See, e.g., Williams v. Fears , 179 U.S. 270, 274 (1900). App. 268a 427. Sebastien is re quired to travel in order to obtain the med ical Cannabis Jagger re quires to eliminate his pain and con tinue to live ; however, if Sebastien were to travel by plane, or on land across State lines or on a fed eral highway, he would be threatened with seizure of Jagger' s medicine, arrest, prosecution, incarceration, loss of his parental rights and/or other consequences attendant with a con viction for a felony under the CSA. 428. Plain tiffs Alexis and Ja gger desire to travel to the Capitol in Washington, DC to meet with their elected repre sentatives and other public officials to advocate in favor of enacting the MJA and repealing the CSA, or otherwise de -scheduling Cannabis ; how- ever, they cannot exercise their fun damental right to travel to the Capitol, as such travel would threaten them with seizure of lifesaving medicine, arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and other consequences attendant with a con viction for a felony under the CSA. P laintiff Jose desires to travel without leaving his medication behind, but cannot do so because, under the CSA, any air travel or travel to a State where Cannabis is legal but does not exer cise reciprocity (or does not otherwise permit his possession and use within the State) would expose him to seizure of his medicine, arrest, pros ecution, incar ceration, and other conse - quences attendant with a con viction for a felony under the CSA. 429. Alexis and Jagger are un constitutionally re - quired to choose between depriving them selves of their fun damental right to con tinue treating with life- sustaining and life -saving medications to preserve their lives, and depriving them selves of the oppor tunity to: (i) travel to other States ; (ii) use an airplane to App. 269a travel to any other State ; (iii) step onto fed eral lands or into fed eral buildings ; (iv) access military bases ; and/or (v) receive certain fed eral benefits. Jose is un- constitutionally re quired to choose between depriving himself of his fun damental right to con tinue treating with his life -sustaining medication and depriving himself of the oppor tunity to : (i) travel to other States ; (ii) use an airplane to travel to any other State ; (iii) step onto fed eral lands or into fed eral buildings ; (iv) access military bases ; and/or (v) receive certain fed eral benefits. 430. Certain members of the CCA desire to travel between and among t he States with their med ical Cannabis, but cannot do so without risk of inves tiga- tion, pros ecution, con viction and incarceration under the CSA, which is disproportionately enforced against persons of color. 431. Defend ants maintain that, not withstand ing the overwhelming weight of the evi dence in the record (including state ments made by the Fed eral Gov ernment itself that Cannabis has curative properties and is safe), Cannabis is supposedly an addictive, dangerous and lethal drug on a par with heroin, mescaline and LSD, and without any med ical benefits whatsoever and thus the CSA must be enforced. 432. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiffs Alexis, Dean, Jose, Sebastien, Jagger and the CCA on the one hand, and Defend ants on the other, by which such Plain tiffs re quire the use of Cannabis and desire to travel, whereas Defend ants irrationally and un constitutionally maintain that such conduct is lethally dangerous and thus must remain illegal. App. 270a 433. By reason of the foregoing, the aforesaid Plain tiffs are entitled to issuance of an order and judg - ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, violates their con stitutional Right to Travel ; and (ii) permanently enjoining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA. 434. Plain tiffs have no remedy at law. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs ) 435. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding 1 -434, as if set forth fully herein. 436. The framework of the United States Con sti- tution created a gov ernment of limited and enu mer- ated powers. 437. Under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3 of the United States Constitution, Con gress has the limited power : To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the sev eral States, and with the Indian Tribes. 163 Hereinafter, the \"Commerce Clause.\" 438. The Commerce Clause does not include a general power to regulate intra -State commerce. 439. The United States Con stitution does not include a fed eral police power. 440. Under the Tenth Amend ment to the United States Con stitution: 163 U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. App. 271a The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 164 441. Congress is not empowered and/or otherwise auth orized to legislate as to matters of intra -State commerce that have no appreciable impa ct on interstate commerce or commerce with foreign nations and/or with Native Amer ican Tribes. Such commerce is reserved to the States and the people who live there. 442. Historically, the regu lation of the doctor - patient rela tionship and deci sions pertaining to dispensing medications have been reserved to the States under the Tenth Amend ment. 443. The Con stitution does not empower Con gress to regulate doctor -patient rela tionships. 444. The CSA, proscribing and criminalizing the use of Cannabis, was not enacted for the pur pose of regulating interstate commerce ; Congress enacted the CSA based upon a series of irrational and dis crimi na- tory motives that cannot be just ified or even explained when considered against an incontro vertibl e record that includes evi dence that the United States Government has ack nowledged in its U.S. Cannabis Patent Appli cation that Cannabis is an effec tive - ment for, inter alia, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's. 445. By legislating sub ject m atter out side its con - stitutional delegation of enu merated powers, and encroaching upon the powers expressly reserved to the States, Con gress engaged in an unauth orized and 164 U.S. Const. amend. X. App. 272a thus un constitutional exer cise of power that violates well-recog nized principles of fed eralism. 446. Even assuming arguendo that distribution and/or sale of Cannabis that occurs on an entirely intrastate level could be deemed to have an appreciable impact on interstate commerce \u2014and, respectfully, it cannot \u2014individual use of Cannabis cannot rationally be claimed to have an effect on the national economy. Thus, it is alleged in the alter native that, even assuming that Con gress were to have the power to regulate purely intrastate economic activity that has no relationship with interstate commerce, Con gress lacks the power to regulate use as a purely intrastate, non-economic activity. 447. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiffs and Defend ants, by which Defend ants maintain that use of Cannabis is lethally dangerous and thus must remain illegal, whereas Plain tiffs maintain that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, constitutes an un constitutional exer cise of power not auth orized by the Con 448. By reason of the foreg oing, Plain tiffs are entitled to issuance of an order and judg ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, constitutes an unauth orized exer cise of power by Con- gress, rendering the CSA, as it pertains to Cannabis, un - constitutional; and (ii) permanently enjoining Defen d- ants from enforcing the CSA. 449. Plain tiffs have no remedy at law. App. 273a FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs ) 450. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-449, as if set forth fully herein. 451. Under the provisions of the CSA, de -schedul - ing or rescheduling a drug such as Cannabis must be supported by med ical and/or scientific evi dence \u2014 such as, for example, the evi dence cited in the U.S. Cannabis Paten t Appli cation. 452. To acquire and accumulate such med ical and/or scientific evi dence, studies and tests must be conducted ; however, because Cannabis has been classified as a Schedule I drug, it cannot legally be tested unless special per mission has been obtained from the Fed eral Gov ernment. 165 453. Upon infor mation and belief, in the 47 years since the CSA was enacted, the Fed eral Gov ernment has granted only one appli cation to conduct scientific and/or med ical testing of Cannabi s. 454. The Fed eral Gov ernment has thus created a legis lative construct which, by design, is com plete ly dysfunctional. The CSA re quires testing and studies to reclassify Cannabis, but prevents such tests and studies from being conducted because Ca nnabis is supposedly so dangerous that it cannot be tested \u2014 except that the stated basis for classifying Cannabis as a Schedule I drug was that Cannabis supposedly had not yet been tested. 165 Pub. L. No. 91 -513, 84 Stat. 1255. App. 274a 455. After creating the Shafer Com mission to conduct such tests an d studies, the Fed eral Gov ern- ment, led by the biased and unstable Nixon Admin is- tration, promptly rejected its find ings. 456. By creating a process that, by its terms, necessarily re quires all petitions for de -scheduling or rescheduling to be denied \u2014and, as regards Cannabis, that is exactly what has occurred with respect to every petition \u2014Congress enacted an irrational, arbi trary and capricious law. 457. Simply put \u2014if, by its terms, the CSA created a petition process to al low aggrieved indi viduals to file futile chal lenges to the classification of Schedule I drugs, then the pro cedure serves no law ful pur pose and is thus un constitutionally irrational and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend ment. 458. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiffs and Defend ants, by which Plain tiffs need and/or desire to use, prescribe and/or engage in busi ness trans actions involving Cannabis, whereas Defend ants falsely and un constitutionally maintain that cultiva - tion, distribution, possession and use of Cannabis is lethally dangerous and thus must remain illegal. 459. By reason of the foregoing, Plain tiffs are entitled to issuance of an order and judg ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, a s it pertains to Cannabis, constitutes an unauth orized exer cise of power by Congress, rendering the CSA, as it pertains to Canna - bis, unconstitutional; and (ii) permanently enjoining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis. 460. Plain tiffs have no remedy at law. App. 275a SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs except Washington and Jose) 461. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-460, as if set forth fully herein. 462. The First Ame ndment to the Con stitution of the United States confirms that : Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people to . . . petition the Gov ernment for a redress of grievances. U.S. Const. amend. I. 463. The pro tections afforded by the First Amend - ment include, inter alia, the right to meet with public officials into advocate in favor or against gov ernmental action. 464. In order for Alexis, Jagger, and certain members of the CCA who treat with m edical Cannabis to meet with public officials at -the Capitol, they would be re quired to leave their med ical Cannabis behind \u2014 otherwise, under the CSA, their medicine could be seized and they (and/or, in the case of Alexis and Jagger, their parents) cou ld be detained, arrested, prosecuted and/or incarcerated. 465. If Alexis's or Jagger's parents were to be detained, arrested, prosecuted and/or incarcerated, their parental rights could be terminated, depriving Alexis and Jagger of the oppor tunity to be raised by one or more of their biological parents. App. 276a 466. The CSA, as applied to Alexis, Jagger, and certain members of the CCA, violates their First Amend ment rights to free speech and the oppor tunity to petition the Gov ernment for a redress of griev ances by re quiring them, as a condition of their entry into the Capitol (or any fed eral Senate or House office building), to risk their health and their lives in order to engage in in -person advocacy with their elected repre sentatives and other federal public officials. 467. Under the provisions of the Ninth Amend - ment and Sub stantive Due Process, Alexis, Jagger, and certain members of the CCA have a fun damental right to con tinue treating with a medication that, for years, has pro vided life-saving and -sustaining treat ment of their conditions. This fun damental right to life and to preserve one's right to life is deeply rooted in this Nation's history and traditions and is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. 468. An actual case in con troversy exists between Plain tiffs Alexis, Jagger, and certain members of the CCA on the one hand, and Defend ants on the other, by which such Plain tiffs need to treat with med ical Cannabis while maintaining their con stitutional rights to free speech and to petition the fed eral gov ernment for a redress of grievances through in -person advocacy, whereas Defend ants un constitutionally maintain that the CSA must be enforceable on fed eral lands and in federal buildings, there by precluding such in -person advocacy. Alter natively, the Fed eral Gov ernment may maintain that the -aforesaid Plain tiffs may travel to Washington, DC to engage in in -person advocacy, but without their life -saving and -sustaining medication \u2014 a prospect whi ch threatens each of the aforesaid Plain tiffs with the loss of their lives and health. App. 277a 469. The Fed eral Gov ernment cannot re quire persons to sacrifice one fun damental right in order to exercise another. 470. By reason of the foregoing, Plain tiffs are entitled to issuance of an order and judg ment : (i) declaring that the CSA, as applied to Alexis, Jagger, and the CCA, constitutes a vio lation of their First Amend ment guarantees of free speech and the right to petition the Fed eral Gov ernment for a redress of grievances, rendering the CSA, as applied to the aforesaid Plain tiffs, un constitutional; (ii) declaring that the CSA, as applied to Alexis, Jagger, and members of the CCA, constitutes a deni al of Sub stantive Due Process and/or fundamental rights guaranteed by the Ninth Amend ment ; and (iii) permanently enjoining Defend ants from enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis, as against the aforesaid Plain tiffs. 471. Plain tiffs have no remedy at law. SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION (on behalf of all Plaintiffs ) 472. Plain tiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation of the preceding \u00b6\u00b6 1-471, as if set forth fully herein. 473. The Fed eral Gov ernment cannot maintain its position on the existing record that con tinued enforce ment of the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis is \"substantially just ified.\" 474. By reason of the foregoing, Plain tiffs are entitled to rea sonable legal fees and costs pur suant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.

Barr, et al. , Docket No. 18 - 859-cv (2d. Cir.) Dear Madam Clerk : We represent plaintiffs Marvin Washington, Dean Bortell (as parent of infant Alexis Bortell), Jose Belen, Sebastien Cotte (as parent of Cultural Association in the above -referenced action (the \"Action\") against defendants William Barr (in his capacity as U.S. Attorney General), the U.S. Depart - ment of Justice, Uttam Dhillon (in his capacity as Acting Admi nistrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), and the United States of America (collectively, \"Defendants\"). We submit this letter in response to the Court's request for an update App. 281a with respect to the status of a certain petition which this Court authorized Plaintiffs to file, by December 31, 2019, with the DEA (\"DEA Petition\"), relative to the misclassification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"). As discussed below, Plaintiffs have not yet filed the DEA Petition because, in the course of its preparation, we learned that the DEA, through which the Attorney General typically decides whether to re - schedule and de -schedule substances under the CSA, has already taken the position tha t cannabis cannot be de-scheduled ; rather, according to the DEA, the Attorney General can only re-schedule cannabis and only under Schedule II of the CSA. Such an outcome would : (i) be inconsistent with prevailing medical evidence ; and, more importantly (ii) comprise relief \u2014 re-classification under Schedule II \u2014that Plaintiffs have never requested and do not seek. Accordingly, it is Plaintiffs' intention to file a motion for an ext ension of time within which to file the DEA Petition to December 31, 2020, and to commence a new action against the DEA and Attorney General for declaratory relief, confirming that the DEA is mistaken with respect to the Attorney General's powers under the CSA. As reflected below, this would allow Plaintiffs to obtain the relief that, according to the Court, would be equivalent to what Plaintiffs' requested in the Action. As further reflected below, re -classification of cannabis under Schedule II would actu ally constitute a substantial step backward in the fight to legalize and de-stigmatize medical cannabis. App. 282a Background By the Action, Plaintiffs requested, inter alia : (i) a declaratory judgment that the classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug under t he CSA is unconstitutional ; and (ii) \"a permanent injunction (and associated temporary relief if so required), restrain ing Defendants from enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis\" (Amended Complaint, Second Circuit Dkt. No. 39, pp. 96 -97). Plaintiffs never requested that cannabis be re -classified under the CSA, much less as a Schedule II substance. See Memorandum of Law, dated December 1, 2017, SDNY Dkt. Nos. 44 -46, p. 106) (\"Plaintiffs bring this action challenging the constitutionality of the CSA ; they are not asking for the Court to reschedule Cannabis or to compel the DEA to do so \") (emphasis added). Had the constitutional claims recited in the Amended Complaint been accepted and sustained by the District Court and/or this Court, and the injunction granted, cannabis would have been de -scheduled on a de facto basis, particularly insofar as unconstitutional acts of Congress are void ab initio , and Plaintiffs request ed a permanent injunction to restrain enforcement of the CSA as it pertains to cannabis. 1 1 Bond v. U.S. , 564 U.S. 211 (2011) ; see also Medical Center Pharmacy v. Mukasey , 536 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2008) (\"If that act of amendment is invalid \u2014for instance, because its unconsti - tutional portions cannot be severed \u2014the act is void ab initio , and it is as though Congress had not acted at all\") ; U.S v. Morgan , 230 F.3d 1067 (8th Cir. 200 0) (\"Congress exceeded its proper authority in enacting [the law] ; the law is [thus] unconstitutional, void (9th Cir. 1989) (\"A law passed in violation of the Constitution is null and void ab initio \"). App. 283a Before the District Court and on appeal, we argued that a DEA Petition would be futile because, inter alia , \"administrative review would not afford Plaintiffs the re lief that they seek \u2014a declaratory judgment and injunction, restraining the Federal Government from enforcing the CSA as it pertains to Cannabis\" (App. Br. at 5, Second Circuit Dkt. No. 37). We interposed the same argument before the District Court. This Co urt, nonetheless, ruled that Plaintiffs are required to seek a re -scheduling or de -scheduling of cannabis by filing the DEA Petition. In this regard, the Court explained its rationale as follows : the gravamen of [Plaintiffs'] argument is that marijuana sho uld not be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA. Were a court to agree, the remedy would be to re - schedule or deschedule cannabis. It cannot be seriously argued that this remedy is not available through the administrative process . See Decisio n, dated May 30, 2019 at 18 -19 (\"Decision\") (Second Circuit Dkt. No. 101) (emphasis added). As discussed below, a review of a prior DEA decision denying a petition to re -schedule or de - schedule cannabis confirms that the specific remedies sought by Plaintiffs \u2014the de-scheduling of cannabis and an injunction against enforcement of the CSA as it pertains to that substance \u2014is, in fact, not available based upon the DEA's current position on t he issue. Discussion In 2016, the DEA denied a petition to initiate rulemaking proceedings to re -schedule cannabis (\"Previous DEA Determination\"). See 21 CFR Chapter App. 284a II and Part 1301, Fed. Register, Vol. 156, 53688, Aug, 12, 2016. 2 In the Previous DEA Det ermination, in a section entitled \"Preliminary Note Regarding Treaty Obligations,\" the DEA advanced the position that, due to United States' obligations under interna tional drug control treaties, cannabis cannot be de -scheduled under the CSA. Id. at 53688 . According to the DEA, under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (\"Single Convention\"), of which the United States is a party, the United States is \"obligated to maintain various control provisions related to the drugs that are covered by the tr eaty,\" which includes cannabis. In this regard, the DEA wrote that : the DEA Administrator is obligated under [the CSA] to control marijuana in the schedule that he deems most appropriate to carry out the U.S. obligations under the Single Convention. It has been established in prior marijuana rescheduling proceedings that placement of marijuana in either schedule I or schedule II of the CSA is \"necessary as well as sufficient to satisfy our international obligations\" under the Single Convention. NORML v. DEA , 559 F.2d 735, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1977). As the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit has stated, \"several requirements imposed by the Single Convention would not be met if cannabis and cannabis resin were placed in CSA schedule III, IV, or V.\" Id. Therefore, in 2 The Previous DEA Determination states that \"marijuana\" refers to \"cannabis.\" App. 285a accordance with [the CSA], DEA must place marijuana in either schedule I or schedule II. Id. at 53688 -89. Based upon the Previous DEA Determination, the DEA, at least currently, would not entertain a petition to de -schedule cannabis, but rather would consider only whether to re -classify cannabis under Schedule II. And, if cannabis were re -classified to Schedule II, Plaintiffs would be saddled with an outcome that, not only would be inconsistent with their prayer for relief, but worse, wou ld exacerbate their situations. Currently, although illegal under federal Law, medical cannabis is available to Plaintiffs and other patients across the United States (in varying degrees) pursuant to 34 state -legal programs. While such programs contain def iciencies and limit cannabis patients in terms of their ability to exercise their constitutional rights, inter alia , to travel, free speech and federal benefits and entitlements, such patients can nonetheless, in most instances, travel to an instate dispen sary and purchase their medications. And, because the Federal Government has attached funding riders to appropriations legislation annually since 2014, the DEA and Justice Department are prohibited from using federal monies to enforce the CSA as it pertain s to cannabis in those states that have implemented medical -cannabis programs. See Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. No. 113 -235, \u00a7 538, 128 Stat. 2130, 2217 (2014) ; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -113, \u00a7 542, 129 Stat. 2242, 2332 -33 (2015) ; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. 115 -31, \u00a7 537 (2017) ; Consolidated Appropria - tions Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115 -141, \u00a7 538, 132 Stat. App. 286a 445 (2018). Thus, while far from perfect -indeed, can - nabis patients are required to forfeit their con- stitutional rights in order to obtain the medication to sustain their health and lives -the current state of the law permits Plaintiffs some level of access to medical cannabis in state -legal jurisdictions. I f, however, cannabis were to be re -classified under Schedule II , overly -burdensome regulation would resume under federal law, creating substantial increases in the cost of cultivating, extracting, packaging and distributing cannabis, and resulting in built -in increases in cost. 3 Pharmaceutical companies would be able to exploit their vast and superior resources to navigate the regulatory process, monopolizing the cannabis market, and allowing them to charge exorbitant prices for medication that is currentl y otherwise available to patients at a fraction of the cost. Indeed, the Court need look no further than the pricing for Epidiolex \u2014a cannabis medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of epilepsy in children and classified as a Schedule V drug under the CSA. 4 Currently, pharmaceutical companies charge in excess of $32,000 3 Rescheduling Marijuana in the U.S. Could \u00a7 1308.15(f). See also The United States Depart ment of Justice, FDA -Approved Drug Epidiolex Placed in Schedule V of Controlled Substances Act, Office of Public Affairs (Sept. 27, 2018), https ://www. justice. gov/opa/pr/fda-approved -drug-epidiolex - placed -schedule -v-controlled -substances -act (\"Epidiolex, the newly approved medication by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), is being placed in schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act\"). App. 287a per annum for regular admin istrations of Epidiolex. 5 By contrast, the cannabis medication upon which Plaintiff Alexis Bortell relies daily to treat her epilepsy and otherwise maintain her health and life is less than $5,800 per year -84% less than the cost of Epidiolex . Re-classifying cannabis under another CSA Schedule would constitute merely an invitation to big pharmaceutical companies to fleece a new population of patients, many of whom are currently able to obtain their medical cannabis at a fraction of the cost. Thus, Plaintiffs, not only never requested that the Court re - classify cannabis under Schedule II, but further, would resist any such effort in its entiret y. Plaintiffs were seeking a ruling under the constitution that would effectively de -schedule cannabis. 6 The Decision herein completely controverts the Previous DEA Determination. In particular, this Court interpreted the DC Circuit's decision in NORML v. DEA (upon which the DEA previously relied) as holding that \"foreign treaty commitments have not divested the Attorney General of the power to re -or de- 5 Peter Loftus, New Marijuana -Based Epilepsy Treatment to Cost $32,500 a Year , THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (Aug. 8, 2018), https ticals PLC said it plans to charge about $32,500 per patient annually in the U.S. for its new treatment for rare forms of epilepsy, the first prescription drug derived from the marijuana plant\"). 6 The recent concerns over lung damage caused by \"vaping\" appear to pertain to black -market products that exist outside any regulatory environment \u2014a probl em which would be cata- clysmically worsened were cannabis to be rendered unaffordable to those who treat with state -legal cannabis daily in regulated state -legal markets. App. 288a schedule marijuana\" (Decision at 21) (citing NORML v. DEA , 559 F.2d 735). Because the Previous DEA Deter mination and DEA' s interpretation of the ruling in NORML v. DEA are inconsistent with this Court's Decision herein, Plaintiffs should be entitled to declaratory relief \u2014specifically, a ruling that the DEA and Attorney General do, in fact, have the power to de-schedule cannabis. To obtain such a result, however, we need to interpose another pro Bono action on behalf of Plaintiffs. And because the declaratory judgment action would likely require at least six to nine months to complete, Plaintiffs need an extension of time within which to file their DEA Petition. Plaintiffs intend to file the motion to extend their time to file the DEA Petition within thirty (30) days. Alternatively, the Court could endorse this correspondence to grant the extension without the necessity of a motion. Respectfully submitted /s/ Michael S. Hiller MSH : me Esq.

ABSTRACT Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age - related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuropr otectants, for example in limiting neuro logi- cal damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive can- nabino ids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is uncounted with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention. A particular disclosed class of cannabinoids useful as neuroprotective, antioxidants is formula (I) wherein the R group is independently selected from the group consisting of H, CH 3, and COCH 3.

FinCEN is issuing this guidance in light of recent state initiatives to legalize certain marijuana - related activity and related guidance by the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") concerning marijuana - related enforcement priorities. This FinCEN g uidance clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana -related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations, and aligns the information provided by financial institutions in BSA reports with federal and state law enforcement pri orities. This FinCEN guidance should enhance the availability of financial services for, and the financial transparency of, marijuana -related businesses . Marijuana Laws and Law Enforcement Priorities The Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") makes it illegal u nder federal law to manufacture, distribute, App. 296a or dispense marijuana. 1 Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this guidance, 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain marijuana -related activity. In light of these develop - ments, U.S. Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (the \"Cole Memo\") to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors con cerning marijuana enforcement under the CSA. 2 The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of DOJ's federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo reiterat es Congress's determina - tion that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of marijuana is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large -scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that DOJ is committed to enforce - ment of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consisten t, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ 1 Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq . 2 James M. Cole, Deputy Attorne y General, U.S. Department of Justice, Memorandum for All United States Attorneys : Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement (August 29, 2013), available at http://www. justice. gov/iso/opa/resources/ 3052013829132756857467 . pdf. App. 297a attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforce - ment resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following i mportant priorities (the \"Cole Memo priorities\") :3 Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors ; Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels ; Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states ; Preventing state -authorized marijuana act - ivity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other il legal activity ; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana ; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use ; Preventing the gr owing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environ mental dangers posed by mari juana production on public lands ; and Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 3 The Cole Memo notes that these enforcement priorities are listed in general terms ; each encompasses a variety of conduct that may merit civil or criminal enforcement of the CSA. App. 298a Concurrently with this FinCEN guidance, Deputy Attorney General Cole is issuing supplemental guidance directing that prosecutors also consider these enforcement priorities with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter, and BSA offenses predicated on marijuana -related violations of the CSA. 4 Providing Financial Services to Marijuana -Related Businesses This FinCEN guidance clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana -related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factor s may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this a ssessment. In assessing the risk of providing services to a marijuana -related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes : (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered ; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining 4 James M. Cole, Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Memorandum for All Uni ted States Attorneys : Guidance Regarding Marijuana Related Financial Crimes (February 14, 2014). App. 299a a state license to operate its marijuana -related business ; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities availabl e information about the business and related parties ; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreationa l customers) ; (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related patties ; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance ; and (vii) ref reshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to infor- mation regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institu tion may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available. As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a marijuana - related business implic ates one of the Cole Memo priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a marijuana -related business. Considering this factor als o enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforce - ment's priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a marijuana -related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports (\"SARs\") as described below. App. 300a Filing Suspicious Activity Reports on Marijuana - Related Businesses The obligation to file a SAR is unaffected by any state law that legalizes marijuana -related activity. A financial institution is re quired to file a SAR if, consistent with FinCEN regulations, the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a transaction conducted or attempted by, at, or through the financial institution : (i) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is an attempt to disguise funds derived from illegal activity ; (ii) is designed to evade regulations promulgated under the BSA, or (iii) lacks a business or apparent lawful purpose. 5 Because federal law prohibits the distribution and sale of marijuana, financial transactions involving a marijuana -related business would generally involve funds derived from illegal activity. Therefore, a financial institution is required to file a SAR on activity involving a marijuana -related business (including those duly licensed under state law), in accordance with this guidance and FinCEN's suspicious activity reporting requirements and related thresholds. One of the BSA's purposes is to require financial institutions to file reports that are highly useful in criminal investigations and proceedings. The guidance below furthers this objective by assisting financial 5 See, e.g. , 31 CFR \u00a7 1020.320. Financial institutions shall file with FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. A financial institution may also file with FinCEN a SAR with respect to any suspicious transac tion that it believes is relevant to the possible violation of any law or regulation but whose reporting is not required by FinCEN regulations. App. 301a institutions in determining how to file a SAR that facilitates law enforcement's access to information pertinent to a priority. \"Marijuana Limited\" SAR Filings A financial institution providing financial services to a marijuana -related business that it reasonably believes, based on its customer due diligence, does not implicate one of the Cole Memo priorities or violate state law should file a \"Mariju ana Limited\" SAR. The content of this SAR should be limited to the following information : (i) identifying information of the subject and related parties ; (ii) addresses of the subject and related parties ; (iii) the fact that the filing institution is filin g the SAR solely because the subject is engaged in a marijuana -related business ; and (iv) the fact that no additional suspicious activity has been identified. Financial institutions should use the term \"MARIJUANA LIMITED\" in the narrative section. A financ ial institution should follow FinCEN's existing guidance on the timing of filing continuing activity reports for the same activity initially reported on a \"Marijuana Limited\" SAR. 6 The continuing activity report may contain the same limited content as the initial SAR, plus details about the amount of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers in the account since the last SAR. However, if, in the course of conducting customer due diligence (including ongoing monitoring for red flags), the financial institution 6 Frequently Asked Questions Regarding the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (Question #16), available at : http://fincen. gov/ whatsnew/ html/ sar_faqs.html (providing guidance on the filing timeframe for submitting a continuing activity report). App. 302a detects changes in activity that potentially implicate one of the Cole Memo priorities or violate state law, the financial institution should file a \"Marijuana Priority\" SAR. \"Marijuana Priority\" SAR Filings A financial institution filing a SAR on a marijua na- related business that it reasonably believes, based on its customer due diligence, implicates one of the Cole Memo priorities or violates state law should file a \"Marijuana Priority\" SAR. The content of this SAR should include comprehensive detail in ac cordance with existing regulations and guidance. Details particularly relevant to law enforcement in this context include : (i) identifying information of the subject and related parties ; (ii) addresses of the subject and related parties ; (iii) details regarding the enforcement priorities the financial institution believes have been implicated ; and (iv) dates, amounts, and other relevant details of financial transactions involved in the suspicious activity. Financial institutions should use the term \"MARIJUANA PRIORITY\" in the narrative section to help law enforcement distinguish these SARs. 7 7 FinCEN recognizes that a financial institution filing a SAR on a marijuana -related business may not always be well -positioned to determine whether the business implicates one of the Cole Memo priorities or violat es state law, and thus which terms would be most appropriate to include (i.e., \"Marijuana Limited\" or \"Marijuana Priority\"). For example, a financial institution could be providing services to another domestic financial institution that, in turn, provides financial services to a marijuana -related business. Similarly, a financial institution could be providing services to a non -financial customer that provides goods or services to a marijuana -related business (e.g., a commercial landlord that leases property to a marijuana -related business). App. 303a \"Marijuana Termination\" SAR Filings If a financial institution deems it necessary to terminate a relationship with a marijuana -related business in order to maintain an effective anti -money laundering compliance program, it should file a SAR and note in the narrative the basis for the termination. Financial institutions should use the term \"MARI - JUANA TERMINATION\" in the narrative section. To the extent the financial institution becomes aware that the marijuana -related business seeks to move to a second financial institution, FinCEN urges the first institution to use Section 314(b) voluntary information sharing (if it qualifies) to alert the second financial institution of potential illegal activity. See Section 314(b) Fact Sheet for more information. 8 Red Flags to Distinguish Priority SARs The following red flags indicate that a marijuana - related business may be engaged in activity that implicates one of the Cole Memo priorities or violates state law. These red flags indicate only possible signs of such activity, and also do not constitute an exhaustive In such circumstances where services are being provided indirectly, the financial institution may file SARs based on existing regulations and guidance without distinguishing between \"'Marijuana Limited\" and \"Marijuana Pri ority.\" Whether the financial institution decides to provide indirect services to a marijuana -related business is a risk -based decision that depends on a number of factors specific to that institution and the relevant circumstances. In making this decision , the institution should consider the Cole Memo priorities, to the extent applicable. 8 Information Sharing Between Financial Institutions : Section 314(b) Fact Sheet, available at : http ://fincen. gov/statutes_ regs/ patriot/ pdf/314bfactsheet. pdf. App. 304a list. It is thus important to view any red flag(s) in the context of other indicators and facts, such as the financial institution's knowledge about the underlying parties obtained through its customer due diligence. Further, the presence of any of these red flags in a given transaction or bus iness arrangement may indicate a need for additional due diligence, which could include seeking information from other involved financial institutions under Section 314(b). These red flags are based primarily upon schemes and typologies described in SARs or identified by our law enforcement and regulatory partners, and may be updated in future guidance. A customer appears to be using a state -licensed marijuana -related business as a f ront or pretext to launder money derived from other criminal activity (i.e., not related to marijuana) or derived from marijuana -related activity not permitted under state law. Relevant indicia could include : The business receives substantially more revenue than may reasonably be expected given the relevant limitations imposed by the state in which it operates. The business receives substantially more revenue than its local competitors or than might be expected given the population demographics. The business is depositing more cash than is commensurate with the amount of marijuana - related revenue it is reporting for federal and state tax purposes. The business is unable to demonstrate that its revenue is derived exclusively from the sale of App. 305a mari juana in compliance with state law, as opposed to revenue derived from (i) the sale of other illicit drugs, (ii) the sale of marijuana not in compliance with state law, or (iii) other illegal activity. The business makes cash deposits or withdrawals over a short period of time that are excessive relative to local competitors or the expected activity of the business. Deposits apparently structured to avoid Currency Transaction Report (\"CTR\") requirements. Rapid movement of funds, such as cash deposits fol lowed by immediate cash withdrawals. Deposits by third parties with no apparent connection to the accountholder. Excessive commingling of funds with the personal account of the business's owner(s) or manager(s), or with accounts of seemingly unrelated businesses. Individuals conducting transactions for the business appear to be acting on behalf of other, undisclosed patties of interest. Financial statements provided by the business to the financial institution are inconsistent with actual account a ctivity. A surge in activity by third parties offering goods or services to marijuana -related businesses, such as equipment suppliers or shipping servicers. The business is unable to produce satisfactory documentation or evidence to demonstrate App. 306a that it is duly licensed and operating consistently with state law. The business is unable to demonstrate the legiti - mate source of significant outside investments. A customer seeks to conceal or disguise involve - ment in marijuana -related business activity. For example, the customer may be using a business with a non -descript name (e.g., a \"consulting,\" \"holding,\" or \"management\" company) that purports to engage in co mmercial activity unrelated to marijuana, but is depositing cash that smells like marijuana. Review of publicly available sources and databases about the business, its owner(s), manager(s), or other related parties, reveal negative information, such as a criminal record, involvement in the illegal purchase or sale of drugs, violence, or other potential connections to illicit activity. The business, its owner(s), manager(s), or other related parties are, or have been, subject to an enforcement action by the state or local authorities responsible for administering or enforcing marijuana -related laws or regulations. A marijuana -related business engages in interna - tional or interstate activity, including by receiving cash deposits from locations outside th e state in which the business operates, making or receiving frequent or large interstate transfers, or otherwise transacting with persons or entities located in different states or countries. The owner(s) or manager(s) of a marijuana -related business res ide outside the state in which the business is located. App. 307a A marijuana -related business is located on federal property or the marijuana sold by the business was grown on federal property. A marijuana -related business's proximity to a school is not compliant with state law. A marijuana -related business purporting to be a \"non -profit\" is engaged in commercial activity incon sistent with that classification, or is making excessive payments to its manager(s) or employee(s). Currency Transaction Report s and Form 8300's Financial institutions and other persons subject to FinCEN's regulations must report currency tran - sactions in connection with marijuana -related bus - inesses the same as they would in any other context, consistent with existing regulations and with the same thresholds that apply. For example, banks and money services businesses would need to file CTRs on the receipt or withdrawal by any person of more than $10,000 in cash per day. Similarly, any person or entity engaged in a non -financial t rade or business would need to report transactions in which they receive more than $10,000 in cash and other monetary instruments for the purchase of goods or services on FinCEN Form 8300 (Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Busines s). A business engaged in marijuana -related activity may not be treated as a non -listed business under 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1020. 315(e)(8), and therefore, is not eligible for consideration for an exemption with respect to a bank's CTR obligations under 31 C. F.R. \u00a7 1020.315(b)(6). * * * * * App. 308a FinCEN's enforcement priorities in connection with this guidance will focus on matters of systemic or significant failures, and not isolated lapses in technical compliance. Financial institutions with questions about this guidan ce are encouraged to contact FinCEN's Resource Center at (800) 767 -2825, where industry questions can be addressed and monitored for the purpose of providing any necessary additional guidance. App. 309a JUSTICE DEPT PRESS RELEASE : \"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ISSUES MEMO ON MARIJUANA ENFORCEMENT\" (JANUARY 4, 2018) Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs The Department of Justice today issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a retu rn to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, Atto rney General Jeff Sessions directs all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well -established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. This return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs. \"It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission,\" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"There- fore, today's memo on federal marijuana enforce ment simply directs all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them App. 310a all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organiza - tions, tackle the growing drug crisis, a nd thwart violent crime across our country.\" App. 311a PRESS RELEASE BY SENATOR CORY GARDNER (R -CO) (APRIL 13, 2018) GARDNER PROTECTS COLORADO 'S LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY Receives Commitment from President Trump to Support Legislation to Protect States' Rights 354 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20515 (202) 224 -5941 ________________________ Washington, DC \u2014Senator Cory Gardner (R -CO) today released the below statement regarding the cu rrent status of the Administration's policy toward legal mari - juana . In response to the Department of Justice's January 4 announcement that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had rescinded the Cole Memorandum, Senator Gardner placed a hold on all DOJ nominees until he received a commitment that Colorado's rights would not be infringed. After positive discussions with DOJ, Gardner lifted some of his holds but kept the rest in place until he received a full commitment that the guidelines of the Cole Memo would be respected. \"Since the campaign, President Trump has consist - ently supported states' rights to decide for themselves how best to approach marijuana,\" said Gardner . \"Late Wednesday, I received a commitment from the President that the Department of Justice's rescission of the Cole memo will not impact Colorado's legal marijuana industry. Furthermore, President Trump App. 312a has assured me that he will support a federalism -based legislative solution to fix this states' rights issue once and for all. \"Because of these commitments, I have informed the Administration that I will be lifting my remaining holds on Department of Justice nominees.

Bach ; Juan Sanchez -Ramos ; Kristin A. Kirlin ________________________ ABSTRACT. The Missoula Chronic Clinical Can - nabis Use Study was proposed to inves tigate the therapeutic bene fits and adverse effects of prolonged use of \"med ical marijuana\" in a cohort of seriously ill patients. Use of can nabis was approved through the Compassionate Inves tigational New Drug (IND) program of the Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA). Cannabis is obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is utilized under the super - vision of a study phy sician. The aim of this study is to examine the over all health status of 4 of the 7 surviving patients in the program. This project pro - vides the first oppor tunity to scrutinize the long -term effects of can nabis on patients who have used a known dosag e of a stan dardized, heat -sterilized quality -con- trolled supply of low -grade marijuana for 11 to 27 years. Results demon strate clinical effec tiveness in these patients in treating glaucoma, chronic musculoskeletal pain, spasm and nausea, and spasticity of mul tiple sclerosis. All 4 patients are stable with respect to their chronic con ditions, and are taking many fewer stan - dard phar maceuti cals than pre viously. App. 314a Mild changes in pulmonary function were observed in 2 patients, while no functionally signif icant attrib - utable sequelae were noted in any other physiological system ex amined in the study, which included : MRI scans of the brain, pulmonary function tests, chest X - ray, neuropsy -chological tests, hormone and immu - nological assays, electro encephalography, P300 testing, history, and neurological clinical ex amination. These results would sup port the provision of clinical can nabis to a greater number of patients in need. We believe that can nabis can be a safe and effec - tive medicine with various suggested improve ments in the ex isting Compassionate IND program.

Cannabis, med ical marijuana, hashish, inves tigational compassionate chronic pain, glaucoma, mul tiple sclerosis, epide - miology, history of medicine, drug policy INTRODUCTION The Missoula Chronic Clinical Can nabis Use Study was propos ed to inves tigate the therapeutic bene fits and adverse effects of prolonged use of \"med - ical marijuana\" in a cohort of seriously ill patients approved through the Compassionate Inves tigational New Drug (IND) program of the Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) for legal use of can nabis obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), under the super vision of a study phy sician. The aim App. 315a was to ex amine the over all health s tatus of 8 surviving patients in the program. Four patients were able to take part, while three wished to remain anonymous, and one was too ill to par ticipate. Unfortunately, that person, Robert Randall, succumbed to his con dition during the course of the study. Thus, 7 surviv ing patients in the USA remain in the Compassionate IND program. Despite the obvious oppor tunity to generate data on the use of can nabis and its possible sequelae in these patients, neither NIDA, other branches of the Nation al Institutes of Health, nor the FDA has published an anal ysis of infor mation from this cohort. An ex amination of the con tents of the National Library of Medicine Data base (PubMed), and search engines of NIDA employing mul tiple combinations of key words failed to retrieve a single citation. The Missoula Chronic Can nabis Use Study thus pro vides a unique and important oppor tunity to scru tinize the long-term effects of can nabis on patients who have used a known dosage of s tandardized, heat -sterilized quality -controlled supply of low -grade med ical mari - juana for 11 to 27 years. The results are compared to those of past chronic use studies in an effort to gain insight into the bene fits and sequelae of this con troversial agent in modern health care. PREVIOUS CHRONIC CANNABIS USE STUDIES The first systematic modern study of chronic can - nabis usage was the Indian Hemp Drugs Com mission Report at the end of the 19th century (Kaplan 1969 ; Indian Hemp Drugs Com mission 1894). The British government chose not to out law cultivation and App. 316a commerce of the herb after ascertaining that it had negligible adverse effects on health, even in chronic application. Similar con clusions were obtained in the \"La- Guardia Report\" of 1944 (New York, NY), Mayor's committee on marihuana (Wallace, and Cunningham 1944), which was the first to employ clinical and sci - entific methods of anal ysis. Three import ant systematic epidemiological studies under taken by research teams in the 1970's exhaustively examined med ical issues in chronic can - nabis use, but remain obscure due to limited press runs and out -of-print status. The first of these was Ganja in Jamaica : A Med ical Anthropological Study of Chronic Marihuana Use (Rubin and Comitas 1975). Therapeutic claims for can nabis were men tioned, but the focus of study was on \"recreational use.\" Sixty men were included in a hos pital study of various clinical para meters if they had maintained a min imum intake of 3 spliffs a day for a min imum of 10 years. Jamaican ganja \"spliffs\" formed of unfertilized female flowering tops (sinsemilla) tend to be much larg er than an Amer ican \"joint\" of 500 -1000 mg. The potency of the cannabis was analy zed with measures in 30 samples rang ing from 0.7 -10.3% THC, with an average of 2.8%. In 1977, a detailed study was under taken in Greece, titled Hashish : Studies of Lo ng-Term Use (Stefanis, Dornbush, and Fink 1977). Once again 60 subjects smoking for more than 10 years were selected. Hash ish potency was 4 -5% THC and was gen erally mixed with tobacco. Al coholics were ex cluded. In 1980, Cannabis in Costa Rica: A Study of Chronic Marihuana Use was published (Carter 1980). App. 317a Forty -one sub jects smoking for 10 years or more were recruited. Al though 10 or more cigarettes per day were smoked, the weight of material was only 2 g with an estimated THC range of 24-70 mg per day. Thirteen samples were assayed with a range of 1.27 - 3.72%, and average of 2.2% THC. Claims of bene fit for cough, asthma, headache, hangovers, anorexia, impotence, depression and malaise were men tioned, but once more, the focus was on soc ial use. The current study is the first designed to ex amine clinical bene fits and side effects of chronic clinical can - nabis usage in which known amounts of quality -con- trolled material has been employed. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE COMPASSIONATE IND Robert Randall was diag nosed with severe glau - coma at age 24 and was ex pected to become totally blind long before he turned 30. He soon began a fascinating med ical odyssey that has been memo - rialized in his \"personal reflection\" co -authored by his wife, Alice O'Leary, titled Marijuana Rx : The Patients' Fight for Medicinal Pot (Randall and O'Leary 1998), and other books (Randall 1991a ; Randall 1991b). Until the day he died on June 2, 2001 at age 52 of complications of AIDS, Randall retained his vision, a nd remained a vocal advocate for the bene fits of clinical can nabis. His own journey com menced when he inde pen- dently dis covered that smoking a certain amount of cannabis eliminated the annoying visual haloes produced by his glaucoma. A sub seque nt arrest in August 1975 for can nabis cultivation led in turn to his dogged pursuit of the right to a legal means to supply his medicine of choice. He sub sequent ly learned of med - ical sup port for his treat ment (Hepler and Frank App. 318a 1971). D. Pate has published two more recent reviews (Pate 1999 ; Pate 2001). Through painstaking doc umentation and experi - mentation, Randall sub sequent ly con firmed the inability of med ical science to con trol his intra ocular pressure (IOP) by any legal phar maceutical means. In contrast, smoked can nabis in large and frequent amounts was successful, where even pure THC was not. As Dr. Hepler observed in their ex periments together (Randall and O'Leary 1998, p. 60), \" . . . clear ly, some thing other than THC or in addi tion to THC is helping to lower your pre ssures. . . . It seems that marijuana works very, very well.\" After a great deal of bureaucratic wrangling, Randall obtained his first gov ernment supplied can - nabis in Novem ber 1976, and the legal case against him was sub sequent ly dis missed. The material he received from his study phy sician was cultivated in a 5-acre plot at the Uni versity of Mississippi, mostly from seeds of Mexican origin, and was rolled and packaged at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina under the super vision of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Randall was encouraged to be thankful, but silent, about his treat ment. Instead, he chose a dif ferent path (Randall and O'Leary 1998, p. 134), \"Having won, why go mum? There were souls to save. Better to trust my fellow citizens and shout into the darkness than rely on a devious Gov ernment dedic ated to a fraud ulent prohibition.\" He chose to make it his mission to seek approval of clinical can nabis for other patients. He devel oped proto cols for glaucoma, mul tiple sclerosis, chronic pain, and AIDS that he shared with prospective medical marijuana candidates. Randall proved to be a App. 319a tireless and per sistent researcher, ferret ing out hidden facts useful to his cause. Through the Freedom of Infor mation Act (FOIA), he dis covered in 1978 that the gov ernment's cost of can nabis cultivatio n and production was 90 cents per ounce (28 g), with 2/3 of this cost attributable to security measures. Thus, the actual cost of production approx imated 1 cent per gram (US $0.01/g). Supply and quality con trol issues arose frequently, and Randall and other patients ex perienced delays in receipt of shipments or sub stitution of weaker strains that re quired doubling of smoked intake. The AIDS epidemic and its sub sequent involve - ment in the med ical marijuana issue suddenly pro - vided an unlimited supply of avail able pa tients for the Compassionate IND program, and Randall assisted them as well. Some succumbed before their supply was approved, or shortly thereafter. By 1991, 34 patients were enrolled in the program accord ing to Randall (Randall and O'Leary 1998), while other sources cite the number as only 15. Facing an onslaught of new appli cations, the Public Health Service (PHS) in the Bush admin istration closed the program to new patients in March 1992. A signif icant number had received med ical approval but were never supplied. Randall sought to ascertain who signed the ulti mate termination order through the FOIA, but was never successful in this endeavor. At the time of this writing, 7 patients sur vive in the program. METHODS The identities of 6 of 8 of the orig inal Compas - sionate IND program sub jects were known to Patients App. 320a Out of Time and were con tacted in rela tion to parti - cipating in a study of the clinical para meters cited as concerns with chronic can nabis usage. Four sub jects agreed to par ticipate, and 3 traveled to Missoula, MT for testing at Montana Neurobehavioral Specialists, and Saint Patrick Hos pital on May 3 -4, 2001. One patient was tested to the e xtent possible in her local area due to physical lim itations on travel (Patient Demographics : Table 1). Tests included the fol lowing (Tests Per formed : Table 2) : MRI scans of the brain, pulmonary function tests (spirometry), chest X -ray (P -A and late ral), neuropsychological test battery, hormone and immunological assays (CD4 counts), electro - encephalography (EEG), P300 testing (a computerized EEG test of memory), and neurological history and clinical ex amination. Past med ical records were reviewed insofar as possible and the histo ries were sup plemented with additional infor mation. All patients signed informed consent doc uments, and the St. Patrick Hospital/ Community Hos pital Joint Inves tigational Review Board (IRB) reviewed the protocol. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Case Histories and Test Data on Four Compassionate IND Program Patients In the following section case histories, clinical ex- aminations and objective test results are pre sented. Patient A Medical History : This almost 62 -year-old female was born with con genital cataracts in Cali, Colombia and spent 13 years of her life there. There was a ques -App. 321a tion of possible maternal ex posure to malaria or qui - nine. Over time the patient re quired a series of 11 surgeries on t he right eye and 3 on the left for the cataracts and had result ing problems with glaucoma. Her last surgery was complicated by hemorrhaging, leading to imme diate and complete loss of vision OD. By 1976, the patient's intra ocular pre ssure was out of co ntrol with all avail able drugs, many of which caused signif icant side effects. At that time she started eating and smoking cannabis to treat the con dition. She under went ex tensive testing in that regard, measuring pre ssures to titrate the dosage of can nabis. She initially had per sonal issues with the con cept of smoking. With out can nabis her intra ocular pre ssures may run into the 50's, while with it, values are in the teens to 20's. In 1988, she was arrested for cultivation of 6 can nabis plants. Her ophthalmolo gist noted (Randall and O'Leary 1998, p. 303), \"it's quite clear - cut this is the only thing that will help her.\" At her trial, she stated in her own defense (Randall and O'Leary 1998, p. 305), \"Marijuana saved my sight. I don't think the law has the right to demand blindness from a citizen.\" She was acquitted on the basis of \"med ical necessity,\" but her approval for the Compas - sionate IND program took 6 months. She had smoked cannabis on her own from black market sources for 12 years pre viously. MRI scan of the brain. TABLE 2.

(timolol, beta - blocker) eye drops daily in the morning, but has con - cerns about result ing broncho constriction. She normally uses can nabis 3 -4 grams smoked and 3 -4 grams orally per day. She feels that the amount that she receives legally from NIDA is i nsuf- ficient for her medical needs. At times she accepts donations from can nabis buyers' clubs. She admits that the results of these out side can nabis samples on her intra ocular pre ssure are unclear. She has had occasion to go to Amsterdam where intra ocular pre - ssures were measured in the teens simply employing cannabis avail able there. She has used Marinol . . . on an emergency basis, such as on traveling to Canada, in doses of up to 5 -10 mg qid. She reports that it lowers intra ocular pre ssure for one day, but within 3 -5 days becomes useless for that pur pose. The patient has a history of cigarette smoking as well, 1 -2 packs a day. She quit in 1997, but sub se- quent ly went on a \"binge\" of cigarette smoking for 13 months, fi nally quitting on New Year's Day 2001. She feels that past pulmonary function has been normal. She also notes lifelong insomnia that is alleviated by eating can nabis. With out such treat ment, she feels she would sleep 4 hours, whereas with it she sleeps 6- 7. She also feels that the drug produces anti - depressant and anti anxiety effects for her. She has a history of scoliosis, but notes no symptoms from this and feels that muscle relaxant effects of can nabis have made her quite limber. The patient had a history of delirium asso ciated with malaria as a child. She had some hardware in her foot from a 1980 surgery after a fall from platform App. 324a shoes. She had a hysterectomy for fibroids. The patient was menopausal at age 48 and has had no hormone replacement treat ment. There is no known history of spe cific meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma, seizures, diabetes, or thyroid problems. She is on no medi cine save for can nabis and timolol eye drops. There are allergies to pen icillin and tetracycline. She c ompleted the equivalent of high school, and is right handed. Family history is largely negative, al though her 2 children had some cataract involve ment. Social history revealed that the patient has worked in the past as a switchboard operator. She is currently dis abled due to legal blindness from her con - dition. She sup ports herself on Social Security Dis - ability Income (SSDI). She has been an activist with respect to clinical can nabis. The patient drinks alcohol at a rate of about a bottle of wine a week. She had past heavy use of caffeine, but now drinks decaf only. The patient walks for ex ercise about an hour a day. Medical Test Results : Objective : Weight : 132 lbs. OFC (Occipitofrontal Circum ference) : 55.5 cm. BP : 104/62. General : Very plea sant, cooperative 62 -year- old female. Head : normocephalic with out bruits. ENT : noteworthy as below. Neck : supple. Carotids : full. Cor : S1, S2 with out murmur. On auscultation of the chest, there seemed to be a prolonged ex piratory phase, but no wheezing. Mental Status : The patient was alert and fully oriented. Fund of know ledge, right -left orientation, praxis and naming skills were normal. She was unable to read a grade 6 para graph with large type due to visual blurring. When it was read to he r, memory of the con tents was within normal limits. She performed serial 3's well. She remem bered 3 objects App. 325a for 5 minutes. On a word list task she named 15 animals in 30 seconds (normal 10 -12). Speech and affect were normal. Cranial Nerves : I: intact t o coconut scent. II : acuity had recently been measured. There was no vision OD, 20/200 OS cor rected. Visual fields OS intact to con - frontation. Optokinetic nystagmus (OKNs) was pre- sent in that eye in all fields. The patient is aphakic with an irregular e ccentric pupil OS and clouding OD. The disk on the left appeared normal. There was prominent horizontal nystagmus resembling a con- genital pattern. Ex ternal extra ocular move ments were normal. Remaining cranial nerves V and VII -XII appeared intact in full. Motor: The patient had normal tone and strength with no drift. Sensation was intact to fine touch, sharp/dull, vibration, position and graphesthesia. Romberg was negative. The patient per formed finger - to-nose and heel -to-shin well. Rapid alternatin g move - ments of the hands were slightly clumsy and fine finger move ments slightly deliberate. Gait in cluding toe and heel were normal with tandem gait normal, but very care fully done. Reflexes were 2 -3+, symmetric with downgoing toes. The patient under went a battery of tests. On pulmonary function tests (Table 3), a Functional Vital Capacity (FVC) was 103% pre dicted. Forced Ex piratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1) was 84% of pre dicted and the FEV 1/FVC ratio was 0.67. This was read as showing a mild obstructive defect based on the above ratio and flow volume curve morphology. No restrictive abnormality was noted. A CBC was wholly within normal limits (Table 4). Abso lute lymph ocyte count App. 326a within normal limits. A full endocrine battery was performed 5), all within normal limits for age and gender. The patient had a P300 test per formed with a latency of 355 millisec onds, within normal limits for a normed population in this laboratory (Figure 1). The patient had an MRI brain study with out con- trast. This was read as showing a mild, symmetric, age consistent cerebral atrophy. A small focus of T2 hyper - intensity and increased signal was noted on the FLAIR sequence in the mid -pons to the left of midline with no sur rounding mass effect or edema. This was felt to be a non specific finding repre senting gliosis most likely from micro vascular ischemic change. No corresponding signal abnormality was seen in the same area on a dif fusion -weighted sequence. A chest x -ray showed slight hyper inflation of the lung fields with no other find ings. Patient A was very pleasant and cooperative through out the neuropsychological assess ment and appeared to put forth very good effort. She did have very signif icant visual deficits and as a result, several instruments were dropped from the battery, including Grooved Peg Board, Picture Arrangement, Symbol Search, and the Faces and Family Pic tures Sub tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale -3rd Edition (WMS - III). She was able to complete the Trail -Making Test A & B from the Halstead -Reitan Neuropsychological Battery, Spatial Span from the Wechsler Memory Scale -3rd Edition (WMS -III), and the Wechsler Edition (WAIS -III)-Picture Com - pletion , Digit Symbol, and Matrix Reasoning, but App. 327a these were not used in inter pretation secondary to the very probable inter fering effects of her lim ited sight. Review of the WAIS -III revealed a Verbal IQ in the upper end of the Average Range (VIQ = 108), and a Per formance IQ in the Ex tremely Low Range, a t only the 2nd per centile (PIQ = 69). This latter, how - ever, is secondary to visual deficits as she had ex - tremely low scores on the Digit Symbol and Picture Completion sub tests. She obtained an age scaled score of 7 on Block Design ; this per formance was also adversely impacted by her visual defects to a mild degree. Assess ment of atten tion and con centration revealed that these abilities are mildly -to-moderately impaired relative to age -matched con trols. She demon - strated an abnormally high number of omission errors on the Con ner's Continuous Per formance Test -2nd Edition (CPT -II) as well as signif icant variability of reaction time. Formal assess ment of learning and memory revealed that this sub ject's abilit y to acquire new verbal material on the WMS -III is within the Average Range relative to age -matched peers. Her Auditory Imme diate Index score was in the average range as was her Auditory Delayed Index. She obtained index scores of 97 and 108 on these two indices, re spectively. Recognition memory for auditory material was act u- ally in the High Average range, the 75th per centile (Index Score = 110). In con trast she did much more poorly on visual measures secondary to very signif - icant visual defects. On the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), the sub ject gen erally per formed within normal limits. App. 328a Although initial learning trials were two stan dard deviations below ex pected limits, her ulti mate acquisition at Trial 5 was one stan dard deviation above normative data sets. Short Delay Free Recall was per fectly normal and long delay recall was only one stan dard deviation below ex pected levels. This loss of recalled items from short delay to long delay free recall repre sented a loss tha t is approx imately 1 standard deviation more than ex pected. Thus, she ap- peared to have mild dif ficulties with initial acquisition of very complex verbal material and also appeared to have minimal -to-mild dif ficulty retaining it in memory relative to age-matched peers. Higher -level ex ecutive functions appear to be en - tirely normal in this patient. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) yielded a T -score of 63, while she obtained a T -score of 42 on the Cat egory Test. Thus, she is still within the para meters seen in a normative data set of age and edu cation-matched peers. This sub ject's per formance on the Thurstone Word Fluency Test was also en tirely normal with a T - score of 51. Likewise, on the Con trolled Oral Word Asso ciation Test, she obtained an over all score placing her at the 78th per centile. She produced 26 items on the Animal Naming Test over a 60 -second period. This is within normal limits. On the Beck Depression Inventory -2nd Edition, she obtained an over all score of 6, arguing against signif icant depressive symptoms. In sum mary, Patient A appears to have mild -to- moderate dif ficulty with dif ficulty with the acquisition App. 329a and storage of very complex new verbal materi al. Gen - eral learning, how ever, as measured on the Wechsler Memory Scale -3rd Edition (WMS -III) appears to be within normal limits. Higher -level ex ecutive functions and verbal fluency abilities are well within normal limits. Patient B Medical History: This 50 -year-old white male carries the diag nosis of the nail -patella syndrome, also known as here ditary osteoonychodysplasia, a rare genetic dis order producing hypoplastic nails and knee caps and renal insuf ficiency. Infor mation was obtain ed from the patient, a published affi davit (Randall 1991b), and sub mitted med ical records. He first smoked can nabis in 1970, but did not become \"high.\" Rather, he felt more relaxed, with out his customary muscle spasms and pain. He first act u- ally used clinical can nabis in a dif ferent manner. At the time he was mining, and he devel oped chemical burns in his hands. A Mexican lady gave him a tincture of can nabis flowering tops in grain alcohol to apply. This reduced his hand swelling and bu rning. He has been smoking can nabis regularly for med - ical pur poses since about 1974. During a med ical crisis in 1985, he suffered a decrease in supply of avail able can nabis. His recollection is that all the various analgesics he received during this time were ineffec tive and produced of dangerous side effects including sedation and incapacity. By 1988, he pursued regular usage of can nabis, about 1/8 of an ounce (3 1/2 -4 g/d) a day when avail - able. He initiated inquiries with the FDA to obtain App. 330a legal can nabis. Ulti mately, with the assis tance of Robert Randall, he received approval from the gov ern- ment in March 1990. He related a history of deformities from birth including missing fingernails, loose finger joints, and small patellae. He was frequently ill as a child, and at age 10, suffered a progression from con junctivitis to varicella, strep throat and rheumatic fever. He was hospitalized for 6 months, and re quired another 3 months of bed rest. Sub sequent ly, he un derwent four right knee surgeries, reconstructions and rotations, including 3 arthroscopies. He had had a right wrist graft with non -fusion. He had had right elbow surgery and had a \"nicked\" ulnar nerve. In the late 1960's he devel oped both hepatitis A a nd B with prolonged hos - pitalizations. Despite this, he pursued heavy manual labor in mining, con struction, auto bodywork and aircraft repair. He lost all his teeth by age 21. In 1972 he dis located his knee and had 3 sub sequent surgeries. In 1976 he had a wrist fracture with sub - sequent surgery and later fusion. In 1978 he was hos - pitalized after a nail wound in his foot failed to heal. In 1983, he injured his back in a fall. Pain con tinued. After a 1985 chiropractic session, he became acutely ill with severe back pain. He was given narcotics, and suffered renal fail ure. He was trans - ferred to a uni versity center. Lithotripsy sessions were followed by trans urethral pro cedures in attempts to clear his nephrolithiasis. Eventually an open proce- dure was per formed for per inephric abscess, but the flank wound failed to heal over the course of a year. Ultimately, it was deter mined that he was suffering a tubercular nephritis. He took tri ple therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin and pyridoxine regularly for App. 331a 18 months. Eventually, a massive debridement was neces sary, before the flank wound eventually healed. His prolonged con valescence forced him to close his business. On Sep tember 3, 1987, he complained of per - sistent flank pain and low back dis comfort increasing over the pre ceding 2 years treated with mul tiple modalities, including TENS unit. He also was using an abdom inal binder. Pain radiated to the buttocks and posterior thighs. X -rays of the lumbar spine showed spondylolisthesis grade 1 in the lumbar area with no signif icant motion of flexion ex tension views. On April 8, 1988, the patient was seen for right knee pain after a twisting injury and fall. An effusion devel oped. X -rays showed a micro patella con sistent with nail -patella syndrome, but no evi dence of fracture. He was treated con servatively. In Oct ober, 1988, chest x-ray showed a dif fuse nodular infiltrate unchanged since Sep tember 1985. By Jun e 7, 1989, the patient was in a wheelchair, but was able to ambulate with a cane. Pre vious x -rays showed bilateral iliac spurs. His chart notes included an FDA con sent form in rela tion to the patient's use of can nabis (Figure 2). On sub sequent vi sits, he had been approved for the Compassionate IND program, and was smoking 10 can nabis cig arettes a day. On April 1, 1991, some cough was noted attributed to cigarettes. As a baseline, very severe pain was noted in the ex tremities, but this was reduced to slight to moderate on sub sequent visits. By April 17, 1991, the patient was on no medicines ex cept for can nabis. By Jan uary 18, 1993, he was said to have only slight App. 332a to moderate problems with a cane for sup port. There were some abdomina l spasms. On the May 14, 1996 visit, he was smoking 10 cannabis cigarettes a day. He used occasional aspirin for increased pain. He had resumed smoking 1/2 to 1 pack of cigarettes a day. Ex amination was fairly unre - markable save for ortho pedic defor mities. He was able to walk on his toes and heels. The patient was given 2 more packages of 300 marijuana cigarettes. On July 16, 1996, the patient was seen for dis - ability ex amination. It was noted the patient had suffered for many years from lack of strength, mobility and range of motion, and per sistent episodes of nausea and muscle spasms. The note indicated, \"the marijuana helps the patient function better in the sense that he has increased flexibility, increased strength and range of motion. He ha s less nausea and less muscle spasm.\" He needed to shift into dif ferent positions at home to get comfortable and could do a sit down type job for an hour or two at most be fore ex - periencing spasms, pain and nausea. He had limited backward flexion, and l imited right hand strength. He was unable to kneel. He could walk 50 feet before needing to rest, used a cane and sometimes a wheelchair for longer dis tances. It was felt he could not be a traveling salesman, and any prospective job would re quire frequen t rests. Over all, he was assessed as having a signif icant functional impairment due to nail-patella syndrome, and was judged unemployable in the short or long term, with little rehab ilitation potential. A May 9, 1997 letter indicates, \"con tinues to smoke about 8 -10 mari juana cigarettes per day and still con - tinues to bene fit from that medica tion. He has less App. 333a pain, less spasms, he is able to ambulate better. His nausea is improved, he is able to sleep better. He is making some slow deter ioration of this dis ease process.\" It goes on to say, \"I per sonally do feel that [Patient B] con tinues to bene fit from marijuana and hope that we can con tinue pro viding this unfortunate man with marijuana medi cation.\" On May 10, 2000, a letter t o FDA noted the patient continued to do well on the therapy, smoking 8 -10 cigarettes per day with out other medication. He con - tinued to function well using a cane and occasionally a wheelchair when bothered by spasms and nausea. At pre sent, he utili zes about 7 grams a day or 1/4 ounce of NIDA ma terial that is 3.75% THC, and was processed in April 1999. The patient cleans the can na- bis to a minimal degree first, estimating a loss of about 25% of material. He indicates that he has been short on his s upply 3 times in 10 years, gen erally for 1-2 weeks, secondary to lack of supply or paperwork problems. When this occurs he suffers more nausea and muscle spasms and is less active as a con - sequence. He was never al lowed to try Marinol . . . , and points out that he could not afford it in any event. The patient reports con tinued problems with pain in the back, hips and legs, also in the upper ex - tremities, right greater than left. When he under goes spasms the pain rises to a 10 on a 10 -point scale and is asso ciated with projectile emesis. His baseline level of pain is 6 -7/10. He notes that this pain was never helped by pre scription medicines. Mor phine sulfate produced a minimal decrement in pain for up to two hours, but caused inebriation. By the third day of appli cation it would become totally ineffec tive. With - out can nabis he feels that he would need very high App. 334a doses of narcotics. He pre viously had dependency issues and took heroin for 2 years in the mid -1960's. Eventually he had become allergic to most phar ma- ceutical pre parations, or had side effects of nausea. The latter con tinues, par ticularly in static positions, which with out can nabis treat ment he rates as a 10/10. In 1985, he was with out can nabis for some 30 days and lost 57 pounds when his supply ran out at the same time that he had TB nephritis. In rela tion to the spasms, these can occur any - where in his body. He feels the medicine eliminates them or sub stantially reduces nocturnal manifestations. With out it he would be \"running\" at night. He has no history of diabetes, thyroid problems, meningitis, encephalitis, or head trauma. He may have had seizures asso ciated with fever. The patient has taken rare anti biotics for staph infections of the skin. He feels that he has had lots of reactions to synthetic chemicals of various types, which he con - siders quite serious. The patient left school at age 14 originally, but attained a GED and had some junior college ex perience. He is left -handed. Family history is noteworthy for nail -patella syndrome in mother, niece, two sisters, nephew and daughter. One sister died of the dis ease at age 44. He has two unaffected children. His affected daughter does not receive legal can nabis. His father died of TB and tumors at age 40. Social History : He currently smoked cigarettes about 1/2 pack a day, but as high as a pack a day in the past. The patient drinks beer about 1 a month, with little alcohol use in 10 years. The patient last worked full -time in 1985, and p art-time in 1990. He is App. 335a on SSDI, but does volun teer and activist work. The patient is able to walk very little due to pain, but bikes when he can a short dis tance (about 4 miles every other day). The patient sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., but this is dis rupted due to pain or nausea. Medical Test Results : Weight : 173 lbs. Height : 69 inches (BMI : 25.6). OFC : 60 cm. BP : 122/80. General : Very pleasant, cooperative 50 YOM who appears somewhat wizened. Head : normocephalic with out bruits. ENT was noteworthy for edentulous state. Neck : supple. Ca rotids : full, with out bruit. Cor : S1, S2 without murmur. The patient has a large indentation scar in the right flank. Palpation to the spine was un- remarkable. Chest auscultation revealed a prolonged ex - piratory phase with out wheezing. Abdominal ex amin- ation was unremarkable. He had dysplastic nails. Mental Status : The patient was alert and ful ly oriented. Fund of know ledge, right -left orientation, praxis and naming skills were nor mal. He read a grade 6 para graph well with good recall. Serial 3's were well done. Signature was normal. He remem - bered 2 of 3 objects after 5 minutes with hesitation, failed the third with hint, but got it with choice of 3. He had a hoarse voice. He named 11 animals in 30 seconds (normal). Affect was normal. Cranial Nerves : I: intact. II : acuity as 20/25 OD, 20/50 OS uncor rected. Fields and OK Ns were normal. Fundi were benign. Pupils equally reactive with full EOMs and no nystagmus. Remaining cranial nerves V and VII-XII were unremarkable. On motor ex amination, the patient had hypotonicity, but de creased bulk. The patient lacked full elbow extension on the right. His strength was gen erally 4+ secondary to limitations and pain. There was no arm drift. Sensation was intact App. 336a to fine touch, vibration, position and graph esthesia, but there was some slight vibratory loss in the feet. Romb erg was negative. The patient per formed finger - to-nose well. Heel -to-shin re quired partial assist of the hands. Rapid alternating move ments of the hands were very slow on the right secondary to me chanical problems. Fine finger move ments were normal. The patient had a stiff, bent gait, but toe gait appeared more normal. On heel gait he favored the left leg. Tandem gait was dif ficult due to back pain and he wavered some. I was unable to ascertain reflexes at the biceps on the right, but respons es elsewhere were 1-2+ with downgoing toes. The patient under went the pre scribed battery of tests. Pulmonary function tests revealed an FVC of 107% of pre dicted, FEV 1 of 95% of pre dicted, and FEV 1/FVC of 0.75. This was inter preted as within normal lim its, but with a slightly prolonged forced ex - piratory time (Table 3). A complete blood count showed some mild poly cythemia, probably due to tobacco smoking. An abso lute lymphocyte count was 3.4 with CD4 count 68.7% and abso lute count of 2324 (Table 4). The patient had a full endocrine of FSH, LH, prolactin, estradiol, estrone, estrogen, testosterone and progesterone were wholly within normal limits for age and gender (Table 5). An EEG was per formed during wakefulness and was within normal limits, but did demon strate some low voltage fast activity in the beta range, with no focal or epileptiform activity. The patient had a P300 response with a latency of 338 milliseconds, within normal limits for the laboratory (Figure 1). An MRI of the brain with out con trast was read as normal. A PA and lateral chest was read as normal. App. 337a Patient B was friendly and cooperative and appeared to put forth very good effort on neuro - psychological testing. On the WAIS -III, he obtained Verbal and Per formance IQ Scores in the Average Range (VIQ = 105 and PIQ = 92). In terms of over all intel lectual functioning, he ob tained an over all score placing him at the 50th per centile (Full Scale IQ = 100). Assess ment of atten tion and con centration with the CPT-II revealed that these abilities tended toward mildly -to-moderately im paired relative to the norm - ative data set. He made an abnormally high number of omission errors and also demon strated sub stantial variability in his reaction time. He als o became more variable as time progressed over this 14 -minute measure. On the WMS -III, he obtained Auditory Imme di- ate and Auditory Delayed Index scores of 89 and 86, placing him in the low average range. His Auditory Recognition Delayed Index was in the average range with an index score of 90. Visual Imme diate and Visual Delayed abilities were also in the low average range with index scores of 88 on both. Overall, these performances are within normal limits, albeit it in the low average range. On the CVLT, this patient's initial acquisition of items after the first trial was one stan dard deviation below ex pected levels, and his recall after five learning trials was two stan dard deviations below. Short Delay Free Recall and Long Delay Free Recall wer e essen - tially at the same level. Thus, his acquisition of very complex verbal material does appear at least mildly impaired. Inter estingly, he does not lose this infor ma- tion from memory after a delay. App. 338a Assess ment of higher level ex ecutive functions yields an over all per formance on the WCST at a mildly impaired level relative to age and edu cation matched peers, with a T -score of 38. His over all per - formance on the Cat egory Test was in the borderline range with a T -score of 40. He also had difficulty following new complex sequences with a T -score of 40 on the Trails A Sub test and a T -score of 32 (mildly -to- moderately impaired) on the Trails B component. Simple motor testing reveals that Tapping Speed was within normal limits, but he had difficulty with fine motor coordination on the Groove Pegboard Test with his dominant left hand. He obtained a T -score of 36 on this par ticular measure with his left hand, a T - score of 42 with his right hand. On the Thurstone Word Fluency Test, he obta ined a T-score of 54 and a T -score of 40.2 on the Con trolled Oral Word Asso ciation Test. Animal naming was within normal limits with a total score of 22. In sum mary, Patient B does appear to have a mild -to-moderate impairment of atten tion and con - centration, and his ability to acquire new, complex detailed verbal material also appears to be mildly -to- moder ately impaired. There is quite some variability in this regard, how ever, with per formances on the Wechsler Memory Scale -3rd Edition (WMS -III) b eing generally within normal limits, and his California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) per formance falling approx imately 2 stan dard deviations below ex pected levels. He had dif ficulty on motor tasks. His perform - ances may have been adversely affected by per ipheral pain as he com plained of such during the assess ment process. His over all score of 0 on the Beck Depression App. 339a Inventory (BDI) argues against signif icant depressive symptoms. Patient C Medical History : This 48 -year-old m ale carries a diagnosis of mul tiple con genital cartilaginous ex ostoses, an auto somal dominant dis order. History was obtained from the patient, a published affi davit (Randall 1991b), and sub mitted progress notes dating from Decem ber 5, 1996. He recalls few med ical problems until age 10, when he threw a base ball and his arm became para - lyzed for a few hours. Radiographs re vealed what was inter preted as an old fracture that had healed with jagged bone fragments. Mul tiple referrals ensued, and ultimately 250 bony tumors were found through out his body. He was diag nosed as having mul tiple con - genital cartilaginous ex ostoses. Each was capable of growth, massive tissue dis ruption, pain, and malignant trans formation . By age 17, he under went multiple surgical pro cedures on the left leg, and right wrist. By age 12, con stant pain and frequent hemor - rhages se verely limited his gait along with other basic functions. He re quired a home tutor by grade 7. By age 14, he re quired ongoing narcotics for analgesia, I in USA) for sleep. He reports resultant fatigue, ennui, and dis - orientation as side effects. At age 20, he devel oped a large bone spur on the right ankle, which recurred dramatically after one surgery. Amputation was re commended, but refused. At age 22, a fist -sized tumor was removed from the pelvis. A med ical odyssey ensued, which failed to App. 340a identify bette r therapies and he re quired massive doses of hydromorphone, methaqualone, and mus cle relaxants. He described himself as a con servative young man who was against drugs, but in college acquiesced to try marijuana. He enjoyed chess, but was normally able t o sit for only 5 -10 minutes with out pain. One day, he smoked can nabis and an hour into a chess match he remained pain -free. After dis cussion with his doctor, he ex perimented by smoking it regu larly for 6 months. He noted a marked enhancement of his analgesia, and a reduction on his dependence on hydromorphone (taken intra venously for some any pre scription drugs. He began to inves tigate possible legal avenues to obtain can nabis, and met Robert Randall in 1978. By 1979, he was spending $3000 an nually on therapeutic cannabis through the black market, an unsustain able burden. A Byzantine bureaucratic process ensued over several years, with final FDA approval of his IND appli cation in Novem ber 1982. Weekly monitoring sessions including needle electro myography (EMG) were deemed neces sary to assess the effects of treat - ment in his protocol. Subsequent ly, he described num erous instances of delayed shipments of can nabis, or ex haustion of supplies of higher potency product. Sub stitution of 1% THC can nabis re quired a doubling of dosage to 20 can - nabis joints a day. He was once arrested in Florida despite doc u- mentation, handcuffed and jailed over night, sustaining App. 341a an ankle hemorrhage in the process. Only 4 of 7 con - fiscated joints were ulti mately returned. Beyond this, he describes can nabis as much safer than pre scribed medicine, and free of serious adve rse effects ex cept chest pain with prolonged usage of inferior product. In 1992, Patient C had occasion to try Marinol . . . during a stockholders meeting in Canada due to his legal proscription from traveling with can nabis. Al - though he had no side eff ects on a dose of 10 mg, it was with out any bene fits, and left his muscles very tight and painful. Detailed progress notes from the last sev eral years were obtained and will be summarized. Decem ber 5, 1996, the patient was using 10 -20 mg of baclofen and 10 -15 can nabis cigarettes a day. Assess ment was of mul tiple con genital cartilaginous ex ostoses with hepatitis C, and GE reflux. He was pre scribed dia - zepam 5 mg for spasm. An EKG was read as showing normal sinus rhythm. Feb ruary 28 , 1996, the patient had pulmonary functions with FVC 112% of pre dicted, FEV 1 of 79% of pre dicted, read as indicating mild obstruction. January 24, 1997, he had episodic spasm with pain affecting both arms and legs. It was noted at the time that the pat ient had a malunion of the right radius. He was down to 2 -3 can nabis cigarettes a day, as he had received no supply from NIDA since Sep - tember 1996, due to logistical problems in seeing his study phy sician. A trans fer of pro viders was re com- mended . September 4, 1997, he remained on baclofen 10 mg p.m., 5 mg a.m. and Prilosec . . . (omeprazole) for epi - gastric dis comfort that had been going on for 7 years, App. 342a and can nabis 12 cigarettes a day. Sep tember 9, 1997, the patient had a chest x -ray with no find ings. Sep - tember 9, 1997, the patient had laboratory tests done, including a CBC, non -reactive hepatitis A and B tests, and normal thyroid functions. Glucose was low at 24, potassium high at 5.4, SGOT 79 with other para - meters negative. Sep tember 17, 1997, the patient was said to be doing well smoking 10 -12 can nabis cigarettes a day with dramatic decreases in frequency and in tensity of flexor spasms. He was also taking baclofen. It was noted that with strong spasms the patient would brui se his skin and sometimes even bleed. His weight was con stant, appetite normal. Neuro - logical exam was fairly unremarkable. He was asked to slowly decrease the baclofen to 2.5 mg bid. May 13, 1998, the patient was said to be doing quite well. In the inter im, a liver biopsy demon strated minimal changes secondary to hepa titis C. Chest x - rays were said to show no changes. The prior Decem - ber the patient had twisted his left knee with a lot of swelling, and an MRI revealed a minor crack in the tibial head. Pain was under good con trol with 12 can - nabis cigarettes a day with only occasional muscle spasms. Exam was unremarkable. He was said to be doing quite well off of the baclofen and was asked to continue 12 cigarettes of can nabis a day. May 26, 1999, the patient related no dif ficulty breathing. Weight was con stant. There was dull pain in the ankles and some sharp shooting also in the knees. There was minor weakness in the right hand with no other deficits. The remainder of the exam was normal. The patient was felt to be doing well and advised to con - tinue 12 can nabis cigarettes a day. Oct ober 6, 1999, the patient was seen in follow up, was on omeprazole, App. 343a Vitamin C, and can nabis. The patient had some con - gestion and mildly productive cough. He was felt to have acute bronchitis and was given cough syrup. Jan- uary 5, 2000, the patient had pulmonary functions done with an FVC 118% of pre dicted, FEV 1 82% of pre- dicted. This was felt to indicate borderline obstruc tion. January 13, 2000, glucose was 126, BUN 26, SGOT 71 with other para meters nor mal, including CBC. Hepatitis C anti body was reactive with other titers negative. Thyroid functions were normal. An SGPT was 181. May 4, 2000, the patient was oc casionally playing softball and had no com plaints of shortness of breath. Again there was mild weakness of the hand with other muscles normal. It was felt that the patient was do ing well with out aches, pains or spasms on his can nabis. Novem ber 21, 20 00, the patient had noticed some increased dis comfort following a motor vehicle accident the prior month wherein he was rear -ended and had neck pain. Sub sequent ly, he noted per sistent pain in the right thigh. An x -ray was negative. He tried physic al therapy, heat and electrical stimulation. He noted more muscle tension with weather change. No neurological changes were observed. Decem ber 28, 2000, the patient was on his ome - prazole and can nabis. Jan uary 6, 2001, SGOT was 50, SGPT 94 with normal CBC and PSA. A cholesterol total was 221 with LDL 136. At the time he was ex amined in Missoula, he noted con stant baseline pain of 9 -10 on a 10 -point scale with out can nabis. At rest, with can nabis this fell to a 4/10. He was smoking 9 grams a day of 2.7% THC NIDA can nabis, or 11 ounces every 25 days. At times App. 344a he has had to cut back due to an inadequate supply. He would sometimes have to use street can nabis at a cost $110 per quarter ounce (circa $16/g) of an estimated 4 -5% THC con tent. Inter estingly, al though he found the flavor was an improvement over the gov - ernment supply, he noted little dif ference in analgesic effect ex cept, but per haps greater relaxation effect. Inter estingly, even with ex tensive can nabis use there are only two times he thinks that he ever may have been \"high.\" One time he left his coat somewhere in freezing weather, which is ex tremely uncharacteristic, and the other he had been with out cannabis for a long time and briefly felt euphor ic while smoking. How ever, once he advanced to a second joint, this feeling was gone. The patient has the most problems with the left arm where pain is a 7 -8/10 when there are flare -ups despite medicine. This decreases after he takes rofecoxib (Vioxx . . . ) for a week. He ex periences pain in both knees, but usually minimal (1 -2/10) with his cannabis. He may per iodically pull a muscle or hemorrhage, especially in the ribs. He has occa sional problems in the wrist. The patient's sleep remain s dis rupted rarely attaining 6 hours total. Typically, he is up every 45 to 60 minutes with stiffness and needs to have pillows to position himself. He once got 8 hours of sleep with methaqualone (now illegal in USA), waking only twice. He feels that his hepatitis C is asymptomatic and was probably due to a trans fusion in his teens. Al - though he did use hydromorphone intra venously for a long per iod of time, he feels that he pursued a scrupulous aseptic tech nique. Besides surgeries noted above, he has dental caps due to bruxism, and App. 345a tonsillectomy. He has had past hyper tension, which he feels was work related. There is no history of diabetes, thyroid prob lems, meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma or seizures. He uses only omeprazole 30 mg a day regu larly in addi tion to his can nabis. He is allergic to barbiturates. The patient had 3 semesters of college. He is pri marily right -handed, somewhat ambidextrous. Family history is negative for other known involve ment, but his father was adopted. His mo ther has migraine. Social History : The patient works full time as a stockbroker. He is also a very decorated dis abled sailor. He plays softball once a week. He may use a stationary bike about 10 minutes at a time, but this is subject to weather effect s. He does not smoke tobacco. The patient drinks about 1.75 liters of Jack Daniels whiskey every 10 -14 days, which helps him sleep. He does not drink coffee. Medical Test Results : Weight : 153 lbs. Height : 5' 4 1/2 \". General : Very pleasant, cooperative 48 -year- old white male who is somewhat obese (BMI : 25.5). Head : normocephalic with out bruits. ENT : unre - markable. Neck : supple. Carotids : full, with out bruits. Cor: S1, S2 with out murmur. The patient had very slight gynecoma stia. He has prominent ex ostoses of the left shoulder, left wrist, right shoulder, and right calf. Auscultation of the chest revealed a prolonged ex - piratory phase with out wheezing. Abdominal palp - ation was negative. Mental Status : The patient was alert and fully oriented. He knew the pre sident and had normal right - left orientation, praxis and naming skills. He read a App. 346a grade 6 para graph well with good recall. Serial 3's were done very rapidly. He remem bered 3 objects for 5 minutes. He named 15 animals in 30 seconds, which is well above the average of 10 -12. Speech and affect were normal. Cranial Nerves : I: intact. II : fields and OKNs were normal. Fundi were benign. Pupils were equally reactive with full EOMs and no nystagmus. Remaining cranial n erves V and VII -XII were unremarkable. On motor exam, the patient had some lim itation due to pain, but see med to have good strength through out ex - cept for 4+/5 foot dorsiflexion on the right. There was no drift. Sensation was intact to fine touch, vib ration, position and graphesthesia, but there was decrease in sharp/dull dis crim ination at the top of the right foot secondary to post -operative changes. Romberg was negative. Finger -to-nose and rapid alternating move - ments of the hands were normal. Heel -to-shin was incomplete on the right, better on the left. Fine finger move ments were minimally de creased. On gait testing the patient slightly favored the right leg at the ankle. Toe gait looked better. Heel gait was barely possible due to pain on th e right side. Tandem gait was minimally hesitant. Reflexes were 1+, symmetric with downgoing toes. Medical Test Results : On pulmonary function tests, an FVC was 108% of pre dicted and FEV 1 67% of predicted. A FEV 1/FVC was 0.51 felt to be indicative of a moderate obstructive defect based on the latter ratio and flow volume curve morphology. No restrictive abnormality was noted (Table 3). A CBC was wholly within normal limits. An abso - lute lymphocyte count and abso lute count of testosterone and progesterone, was wholly within normal lim its for age and gender (Table 5). An EEG was per formed du ring wakefulness and early stages of sleep, which was within broad normal limits. There was a good bit of low voltage fast activity in the beta range. No focal nor epileptiform ac tivity was appreciated. A P300 showed a latency of 262 milliseconds felt to be within normal limits for the lab (Figure 1). An MRI was per formed with out con trast. There was felt to be no definite abnormality of an acute nature. There were some minor changes in the right parietal area suggestive of a mild degree of gliosis with associated dilated per ivascular spaces of doubtful signif icance. There was a small area of abnormal signal in the right parotid gland over lying the right masseter muscle felt to be probably benign. A P-A and lateral chest x -ray were per formed. This was read as showing a pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe with minimal airway changes. One ex - aminer (EBR) reviewed those films and felt that the lesion was act ually located in a rib. As a result, the patient under went a CT scan of the chest after returning home. This showed no evi dence of mass, lymphadenopathy, or pulmonary nodules. A small amount of pleural calcification was noted. An ex - ostosis was noted in the right an terior 3rd rib, accounting for the false -positive chest x -ray. On neuropsychological testing, Patient C was pleasant, cooperative, and appeared to put forth very App. 348a good effort. His atten tion was noted to be quite poor at times and many in struc tions had to be repeated. On the WAIS -III, he obtained Verbal and Per - formance IQ Scores in the Average Range with a Verbal IQ of 103 and a Per formance IQ of 104. In terms of over all intel lectual functioning, he is currently performing at a level equal to or above 58 per cent of the gen eral population (Full Scale IQ = 103). Assess ment of atten tion and con centration imme diate atten tional abilities were within normal limits. His abil ity to con centrate, however, did appear mildly impaired, as he tended to lose efficiency with the pa ssage of time. Thus, vigilance appeared to be mildly decreased relative to a normative data set. On the WMS -III, Patient C obtained an Auditory Imme diate Index in the Average Range at the 70th percentile. His Auditory Imme diate In dex was 108. Auditory Delayed Index was also 108, placing him in the Average Range, and his Auditory Recognition Delayed Index was 115, placing him in the High Average Range. The Visual Imme diate Index was 115 with a Visual Delayed Index of 122, per formances in the High Average and Super ior Ranges, respectively. On the CVLT, this patient's initial acquisition on Trial One was two stan dard deviations below ex pected levels and his acquisition of only ten items by Trial 5 was one stan dard deviation below ex pected levels. Short Delay Free Recall was also one stan dard deviation below ex pected levels but he per formed within normal limits if pro vided cues. His ulti mate free recall after a 20 -minute delay was also one stan - dard deviation below ex pected levels. There was not a App. 349a substantial loss of infor mation between Long Delay and Short Delay Free Recall trials. Thus, his ability to acquire very complex and detailed new verbal mate - rial does appear minimally -to-mildly decreased relative to a ge matched peers, well below his ability to acquire new thematically organized ver bal material, which was in the above average range. Memory, how - ever, appears normal. Assess ment of higher level ex ecutive functions yielded a T -score of 45 on the WCST and a T -score of 44 on the Cat egory Test from the Halstead -Reitan Neuropsychological Battery. His ability to follow new complex sequences was en tirely within normal limits as indicated by T -scores of 52 and 62 on Trail Making Test A and B, respec tively. Simple motor speed measured by Finger Tapping was within normal limits, bilaterally, as was fine motor coordination measured by the Grooved Pegboard Test. His per formance on the Thurstone Word Fluency Test yielded a T -score of 56, which is en tirely within normal limits relative to age and edu cation-matched peers. Likewise, his over all per formance on the Con- trolled Oral Word Asso ciation Test yielded a T -score of 52.52, and Animal Naming Fluency also was within normal limits. His over all score on the Beck Depression Inventory -2nd Edition (BDI -II) was 0. Overall, Patient C appears to have mild dif ficulty sustaining atten tion and also minimal -to-mild dif - ficulty with the acquisition of very new, complex verbal material. Overall, how ever, he appears to be function ing quite well. App. 350a Patient D Medical History : This 45 -year-old female carries a diag nosis of mul tiple sclerosis (MS). The patient was inter viewed by tele phone (EBR) in lieu of the possibility of con temporaneous e xamination. The patient feels her first problem may have occurred at age 18 when her vision se quentially went com plete ly black for two months with slow improve ment over a subsequent four months. A possible attribution to oral contraception was hypothesized. She was sub sequent - ly evaluated at a quaternary referral center and diag - nosed as having retro -bulbar neuritis. She was pre - scribed nicotinic acid. On re -evaluation in 1983, no active dis ease was noted. On May 29, 1986, best cor- rected vision was 20/30 OD, 20/25 OS. By May 19, 1988, values fell to 20/200 OD, and 20/70 OS. The patient was formally diag nosed as having MS April 1 of that year with asso ciated bilateral optic neuropathy. She had had symptoms for per haps 6 mont hs with blurring in both eyes and leg spasms that interfered with walking. The patient had never used cannabis recreation ally, and began it only because of her symptoms. She has been followed in her local area by a psych iatrist and neurolo gist. Ex tensive, well -docu- mented notes commencing Decem ber 20, 1989 were provided, and will be summarized. When first seen on that date the patient was married for the second time. It was noted that she had been diag nosed with MS about a year and a half pre viously and had been on diazepam from time -to-time. She was taking 10 mg tid to cope with stress. She had pre viously tried trazodone and buspirone, had be come para lyzed with her MS, and was con sequent ly very frightened of App. 351a these medicines. On ex amination she was felt to be quite anxious and was provisionally diag nosed as having a dysthymic dis order. On March 20, 1990, she seemed to be suffering from more depres sion, al though she managed to smile. She described dif ficulty with self -esteem and hopelessness. She had only been taking diazepam inter mittently and was rather pre scribed (alprazolam) 0.25 mg up to 3 times a day. She was felt to have recurrent major depression. On s ubsequent visits the patient had slight adjustments of medicine and was feeling better by May 2, 1990. By Au gust 6, 1990, the patient was having greater dif ficulties with insomnia. She was given trazodone 50 mg at bedtime on a trial basis. August 24, 1990, the patient was only sleeping until 4 a.m., which was about 2 hours better than with out medicine. This was increased to 75 mg. The patient had heard about some studies of using can nabis in MS as a relaxing agent. She indicated that she had tried t his with a good relax - ation response. There was a dis cussion of possible effects on the lungs, and her ex pected diminished life expectancy because of MS. She was given a pre - scription for Marinol . . . (dronabinol, synthetic THC) 10 mg to be tried q 4 h ours prn to see if this would help with relaxation and nau sea. When seen Sep tem- ber 5, 1990, she had found that the Marinol . . . had reduced the nausea con siderably and had even helped her vision. She con tinued on fluoxetine. September 27, 1990, the patient was not sleeping well, possibly due to fluoxetine, and was given a benzodiazepine. Oct ober 17, 1990, the patient was seen in follow up and was on Xanax . . . (alprazolam). App. 352a It improvement with Marinol . . . , but the patient noted she act ually had a better response to smoked can nabis. They began to look into obtaining a legal supply. Decem ber 3, 1990, the patient reported increased depression and was increased to 40 mg a day of fluoxetine. Decem ber 5, 1990, the patient had recurrent depression even on the fluoxetine 2 a day and low dose alprazolam. Apparently, her doctor had received notification that he could no longer pre scribe Marinol . . . \"off label\" unless a Schedule I per mit for cannabis was being pursued. Decem ber 19, 1990, the patient re ported nausea, for which some of her remaining Marinol . . . had helped. Jan uary 16, 1991, the patient complained of spasticity spells and epi - sodes of nausea. She had run out of Marinol . . . and had no cannabis sup ply. She indicated she had tried other medications with out success and was resistant to try others due to side effects. February 20, 1991, the patient had purchased illicit can nabis in the interim. April 16, 1991, the patient con tinued on fluoxetine 20 mg bid. More jerkiness was noted with increased spasticity. She had not smoked can nabis before coming in. It was felt that she would need 6 can nabis cigarettes a day to reduce symptoms. May 10, 1991, she was taking alprazolam about every 2 weeks. She was con tinuing to have some spasms. She con tinued to try can nabis illicitly, but had not yet obtained it legally. June 14, 1991, she had lost her driver's license due to visual problems asso ci- ated with MS. During this inter val there were more marital issues. July 2, 1991, it was indicated the patient was legally blind and there were no possible corrective measures. Plans were in place to obtain App. 353a legal can nabis for spasticity and nervous problems. It was noted that can nabis seemed to be very effec tive for her clinically. August 7, 1991, the patient was still without a supply and complained of her legs jerking at night, and increased dif ficulty walking. The patient requested Marinol . . . , but this could not be pre - scribed. She was given baclofen 5 mg tid to try. August 30, 1991, she received her first shipment of NIDA can nabis, seven months after approval of the Compassionate IND. The patient was advised that she should con fine her use to gov ernment can nabis. She was having problems with her gait, able to walk only with a cane. There were con tinued vision problems. She complained of left sided weakness. The patient smoked a can nabis cigarette in front of the doc tor, which led to her feeling better. It was suggested she try 3 can nabis cigarettes a day. Sep tember 3, 1991, the patient reported that the gov ernment supply of can - nabis did not have the \"punch\" that street bought material had. Her dose was increased to 5 joints a day. It was indicated that her spasticity responded positively to the dose increase. Sep tember 11, 1991, the patient was on 5 NIDA cigarettes a day. This was helping her spasticity. She was unclear as to whether her vision was helped. Sep tember 20, 1991, it was fe lt that 7 cigarettes a day would be neces sary. The patient reported increased muscular activity, uncontrollable at times. Oct ober 2, 1991, the patient had run out and was noticeably more spastic on ex am- ination. Her dose was increased to 10 a day. October 9, 1991, the patient was on 10 can nabis cigarettes a day of the strongest avail able dosage, which seemed to help her spasticity. She was walking with out a cane. It was not felt that her depression was improved. App. 354a Novem ber 4, 1991, she had been o ut of her supply for 10 days. Spasticity increased and she complained of pain in the left leg. Increased tone was noted through - out the body. Decem ber 5, 1991, apparently a supply came in of lower potency can nabis. Decem ber 19, 1991, it was felt she ha d con tinued improvement of her spasticity with better gait. Feb ruary 14, 1992, she was using 1 can of can nabis a month, equal to 300 cigarettes. The patient reported she had not been falling. March 13, 1992, she con tinued the can nabis at the s ame rate, plus 40 mg of fluoxetine and no alprazolam. The patient reported she was able to walk, swim better, and do all of her ADL's much easier than she could prior to the can nabis. There was no observable gait dis turbance on exam. April 14, 1992, it was felt that she got a lot of relief from her medicine and that it \"probably offers her greater efficacy in her spasticity, also, than Valium would.\" May 19, 1992, the patient con tinued to be stable with no ex acerbations of her MS a nd the spasticity under good con trol. There were con cerns about per iodontal dis ease from her dentist. It was thought she might do better with less smoking of a higher potency sup ply. The patient was also smoking cigarettes and was sub sequent ly advised to avoid tobacco. By July 17, 1992 she con tinued to respond to cannabis. Sep tember 18, 1992, reflexes were equal and not hyper active. Novem ber 16, 1992, there was an increase of depression slowly and in sidiously. Decem - ber 9, 1992, the p atient had been off of her treat ment for a week and was very shaky. Smoking a joint in front of her doctor caused her to become calm, less shaky and better able to walk. Jan uary 19, 1993, she got her first cans of the stronger can nabis, which the App. 355a patient felt more effec tive after smoking one joint. March 22, 1993, she was smoking 6 -7 a day. She seemed better after smoking one in the of fice. April 22, 1993, the patient was smoking 10 cigarettes a day. Smoking produced a decrease in spasticity as observed. There were no adverse effects that were noted in the office. May 24, 1993, the patient was tried on lorazepam. June 24, 1993, the patient was upset with finan cial issues and was placed on Mel laril . . . (thioridazine). July 22, 1993, when she was ex amined, no tremor or spasticity was noted. Again can nabis was smoked with no adverse effects noted. August 30, 1993, the patient requested a decrease in her fluoxetine . She felt that spasticity and depression were both helped by the can nabis. Se ptember 29, 1993, the patient reported that on a lower fluoxetine dose she was getting tear ful. Reflexes were not hyper active. Novem ber 2, 1993, the patient had some paresthesias on the left side, but was maintaining good motor con - trol. Decem ber 28 , 1993, she was tried on bupropion. January 4, 1994, problems had been noted on bupropion and it was not as effec tive. She was tried on sertraline. She reported that the can nabis helped her to not think about her MS. She was having fewer spasticity pr oblems. February 4, 1994, when the patient smoked can - nabis in the office, she seemed to be a little more talkative and relax signif icantly with less spasticity and no adverse effects. Feb ruary 28, 1994, again signif icant relief from spasticity was noted upon smoking. March 30, 1994, the pa tient had some numbness and tingling in the limbs. The patient reported the new material was stronger and had a better effect. May 9, 1994, some increase in emotional App. 356a lability was noted. The patient was taken off of sertraline and put on Effexor . . . (venlafaxine). May 25, 1994, she was unable to tolerate the latter and was started back on fluoxetine. August 29, 1994, she con - tinued on fluoxetine and can nabis. Smoking a joint calmed her and limited tremor. September 28, 1994, it was indicated in rela tion to can nabis \"it seems to have a positive effect on her mental sta tus overall.\" October 31, 1994, the patient was felt to be with out signs of depression. She act ually lowered her dose on a higher potency material. Feb ruary 1, 1995, the patient was on diazepam again. Feb ruary 14, 1995, she was increasingly shaky and tearful. March 29, 1995, she was hardly able to walk due to an ex - acerbation. May 2, 1995, she still needed sup port. At the same t ime the patient was having marital dif fi- culties. August 4, 1995, the patient reported she could see much better with the can nabis. By Sep tember 6, 1995, she was walking quite well and was no longer on diazepam, merely the fluoxetine and can nabis. Oct- ober 4, 1995, she con tinued to walk well with no problems. January 17, 1996, an MRI revealed mul tiple bilateral per iventricular and dif fuse white matter changes in the cerebrum and cerebellum, but seemingly fewer than on a April 4, 1995 study. April 19, 1996, the patient had been out of can na- bis for a week and was ex periencing more spasticity and ambulation dif ficulties. She was more depressed. May 17, 1996, the patient had been tried on a stimu - lant. July 10, 1996, the patient report ed that can nabis was the only thing that had helped her with her symptoms over the course of her illness. App. 357a By Sep tember 25, 1996, the patient had been with out medicine for a month and had to buy it on the street. She had lost weight and her con dition had reportedly decom pensated to some degree. The patient reported a 10 -pound weight loss. Novem ber 13, 1996, the patient was having dif ficulty sleeping, but did not wish to take trazodone. Novem ber 27, 1996, the patient had fallen and had a brief lo ss of con sciousness. Decem ber 5, 1996, she had had an episode of spasticity that was the worse she had ever had, starting in the neck and going down her back. Jan uary 8, 1997, can - nabis came in after a summer drought since Sep tem- ber 25. An emergenc y supply was requested. Jan uary 22, 1997, the patient re mained con cerned about lack of can nabis supply. Feb ruary 5, 1997, she con tinued with this con cern. Feb ruary 19, 1997, there was dis - cussion of dif ficulty the patient had ex perienced with the author ities in an airport. April 2, 1997, it was felt the patient con tinued to get a great deal of relief from smoking 10 joints a day with out any adverse effects. July 2, 1997, the patient was observed to become more loquacious an d inter - active af ter dosing. January 29, 1998, the patient was not complaining of spasticity, seem ing to have con siderable relief with cannabis. Her fluoxetine was low ered to 20 mg a day. March 24, 1998, it was felt that she had a very slow progres sion of her MS helped by her con sumption of cannabis. Sep tember 22, 1998, the patient said that the medicine took away her fear of the dis ease and when she would get a pain she would be able to smoke and take it away. October 27, 1998, she apparent ly had been out of her supply for 6 weeks, but had gotten by smoking App. 358a only 4 cigarettes a day instead of the usual 10. Jan u- ary 24, 1998, the patient was doing relatively well and was walking with a cane. Decem ber 22, 1998, she was having increas ing prob lems. Jan uary 26, 1999, the patient indicated that medicine helped her maintain her weight. March 24, 1999, it was observed, \"I think her spasticity is being helped with the can nabis.\" April 23, 1999, she con tinued to get good relief with 10 cigarettes a day. June 24, 1999, the patient reported some increasing dif ficulty with walking in the heat and hot weather. July 20, 1999, she was said to have no tremor or spasticity. Sep tember 1, 1999, she was having some ex acerbation and dif ficulty walking and limping because her right leg was not working as well. October 20, 1999, the patient reported the only bad side effect would be when she smoked too much she would tend to go to sleep. She dis cussed alter native treat - ments for mul tiple s clerosis with her doctor and they agreed not to pursue them. Novem ber 19, 1999, the patient was walking on a wide base felt to be the result of a mild ex acerbation. Novem ber 24, 1999 neurological ex amination confirmed greater ataxia. Methylphenidat e was pre scribed . Decem ber 1, 1999, an MRI of the brain was said to reveal mul tiple focal white matter changes in bilateral cerebral areas especially in the basal ganglia and in the cerebellar peduncle, compatible with MS. January 12, 2000, the patient was tried on Ritalin . . from fluoxetine. Feb ruary 22, 2000, the patient reported that her eyes were improved. March 9, 2000, visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 2 0/80 OS. April 6, 2000, it was felt that she had no declines in function from can nabis use. App. 359a June 27, 2000, her can nabis had been late coming in and she had cut from 10 to 6 or 7 cigarettes a day, feeling that that had hurt her physi cally and that she was not walking as well. Jan uary 31, 2001, the patient was a little bit down and labile, but by Feb ruary 28, 2001, she was not depressed or hyper. April 11, 2001, she was having some trouble walk ing due to a flare of symptoms, which had been pre sent for a month, but she noted no changes in vision. When the patient was inter viewed by EBR (June 2001), she reported that her vision was currently clear with can nabis. She was able to ambu late with out aids, but has to stop after a block or less due to weakness. She swims a few days a week. She feels that there is no nystagmus in her vision and no diplopia. She characterizes her MS as mildly pro gressive. The patient indicated that she received the can- nabis legally in 1991 and con tinues to smoke 10 cigarettes a day. She currently receives material of 3.5% THC con tent that was processed April 1999. Her study phy sician requests the highest potency material avail able, which has re cently varied between 2.9-3.7% THC. When she uses out side can nabis of higher potency, she feels that she gets twice the relaxation. There is no chronic cough or other dif ficulties. The patient feels that Marinol . . . at 10 mg was too strong. She used it for 6 mo nths before the can nabis. Customarily she splits each of her supplied cigarettes in two, and mani cures it slightly. When she is not on cannabis she has had no with draw al symptoms, but has had increase in move ment problems. The patient has had a tu bal ligation. She con tin- ues to menstruate on a regular monthly basis. Her main problems have been depression and some degree App. 360a of anxiety. I asked about other diag noses and she replied that she had \"10 per sonalities and they are all feeling fine!\" She d enied history of diabetes, thyroid problems, meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma or seizures. The patient remains on fluoxetine 40 mg a day. She is allergic to penicillin. The patient had 1 year of college. She is right handed. Family history is notewort hy for father having narcolepsy and a sis ter who is bipolar. Social History : She had one child by choice. The patient is a retired clothier, and is unable to work at this time. She is currently smoking 1/2 pack of cigarettes a day, pre viously 1 pack a day, and has smoked since age 20. The patient does not drink at all, has not for 5 years, nor has she ever had a problem with alcohol. She does not drink coffee. She cus - tomarily sleeps 8 hours. Medical Test Results : The patient is 5 feet tall and 97 pounds (BMI : 19). On pulmonary function tests, an FVC was 79% of pre dicted, and FEV 1 76% of pre - dicted. The FEV 1/FVC was 86 (Table 3). There was felt to be no obstruction based on this ratio or anal ysis of the F/V curve morphology. Early small airway dis ease and borderline restrictive dis ease ( e.g., due to MS) were not ex cluded. A CBC was wholly within normal limits. An abso - lute lymphocyte count was 2.3 with and abso lute count of 1325 (Table 4). An endocrine battery was per formed, of FSH, LH, prolactin, estradiol, estrone, estrogen, testosterone and progesterone, all within normal limits for age an gender (pre -menopausal female) (Table 5). App. 361a Neuropsychological tests were per formed in her home on June 17, 2001. Some con fusion was noted through out the evaluation and signif icant fatigue over the course of the day was also apparent. She did not have signif icant dif ficulty with in struc tions, how ever, and effort and cooperation were suf ficient to obta in what is believed to be valid data. As a result of signif - icant visual deficits, many visually based tests were omitted and inter pretations from those requir ing signif icant visual input were pro vided in a very cautious manner. For ex ample, this pati ent re quired a magnifying glass in order to accomplish the Picture Comple tion and Trails sub tests that very likely had a signif icant negative impact on her over all per - formance. On the WAIS -III, the patient obtained a Verbal IQ of 93. A Per forman ce IQ was not calculated secondary to signif icant visual deficits that inter fered with assess ment in this realm. On the WMS -III, the pa - tient per formed, on verbal measures, in the Low Average Range. Imme diate auditory memory was at the 18th per centile, with an auditory delayed index in the Average Range. Her ability to acquire non - themat ically -organized verbal material was in the mildly impaired range rela tive to age -matched peers, but her retention was act ually very good. Also, she did very well on a test measuring her ability to acquire verbal paired asso ciates with a learning slope act ually in the above average range, and ex cellent retention. Her ability to acquire more detailed and non - thematically -organized verbal infor mation was moderately -to-severely impaired relative to age - matched peers. Over all per formances on the CVLT App. 362a ranged from two to five stan dard deviations below ex- pected levels. Numerous intrusions during both free and cued recall were noted at levels above and beyo nd what is gen erally seen in the normative pop ulation. She made eight false -positive errors on recognition testing, which are also an abnormally high number of errors. Concentration was noted to be markedly impaired in this patient, fol lowing the mildl y-to-moderately impaired range overall. Assess ment of Ex ecutive Functions reveals that abstract con cept formation and logical anal ysis abilities were signif icantly reduced, falling in the moderately impaired range overall. The patient was also noted to be quite per severative, having dif ficulty shifting cognitive strategies. In slight contrast, flexibility of thought as measured by the Similarities Sub test from the WAIS -III, was within normal limits. Verbal Fluency was within normal limit s relative to age and edu cation-matched peers. In sum mary, this patient appears to have decre - ments in con centra tion, low average learning, and memory efficiency for new thematic material and verbal paired asso ciates. Her ability to acquire more detailed and non -thematically -organized verbal infor - mation is at least moderately impaired. Memory functions, how ever, appear to be normal in the sense that once she acquires infor mation, she seems to hold it quite effec tively. Higher level ex ecutive functions are reduced at a moderate level despite a very remarkable psych iatric history. Responses to the BDI- II were well within normal limits. Patient D thus demon strates numerous neuro - cognitive impairments. The gen eral pattern is not par - ticularly uncommon in the con text of mul tiple App. 363a sclerosis and signif icant psych iatric dysfunction. This profile, when combined with the others from the data set do not pro vide any con sistent pattern that one could reasonably ascribe to the therapeutic use of can - nabis. Review of Neuropsychological and Cognitive Data The scientific study of the effects of chronic can - nabis on cognition has remained problematical since such con cerns were first raised. De spite intensive effort in this regard, little in the way of \"hard find ings\" or con sistent results has emerged. A complete review of alleged problems is beyond the scope of this article, but a few citations are merit orious. In the Jamaican studies (Rubin and Comitas 1975), 19 neuropsychological tests were admin istered to chronic can nabis users and con trols with no major signif icant dif ferences between groups. In fact, ganja smokers scored the highest on Wechsler Adult Intel - ligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Span per formance (p < 0.05). The au thors con cluded (p. 119), \"in a wide variety of human abilities, there is no evi dence that long -term use of can nabis is related to chronic impairment.\" In Greece (Kokkevi and Dornbush 1977), no dif fer- ences were noted between hashish users and age and socio -economically matched con trols in total or Per - formance IQ (PIQ) scores on the WAIS. Con trols per - formed better on three sub tests : Comprehension (p < 0.01), Similar ities (p < 0.005), and Digit Symbol Sub- stitution (p < 0.05). Con trol V erbal IQ (VIQ) surpassed that of users (p < 0.05). How ever, these results must be viewed in light of the fact that normal population studies in Greece revealed PIQ :VIQ differences of 7 points. Thus, the authors con cluded (p. 46), \"These App. 364a observations d o not pro vide evi dence of dete rioration of mental abilities in the hashish users.\" In Costa Rica, an ex tensive battery of neuro - psychological measures showed no path ological changes (Carter 1980). It was observed (p. 188), \"we failed to uncover signif icant dif ferences between user and non- user groups in those sub jects who had con sumed cannabis for over eighteen years.\" Subsequent ly follow -up studies were per formed on some of this co hort, and certain signif icant dif fer- ences were claimed, including learn ing of word lists and selective and divided atten tion tasks (Fletcher et al. 1996). How ever, a detailed critical anal ysis of those results in Mari juana Myths, Marijuana Facts (Zimmer and Morgan 1997) seems to deflate any such claim. Lyketsos et al. (1999) studied effects of can nabis on cognition in 1318 adults over a per iod of 12 years. No dif ferences were noted in the degree of decline between heavy, light, and non -users of can nabis on the Mini -Mental State Ex amination (MMSE). Critics have indicated that the latter repre sents too crude a tool to measure the issue properly. In a series of studies in the 1990's summarized in a book, Cannabis and Cognitive Functioning (Solowij 1998), Nadia Solowij studied sub jects employing can - nabis at least twice a week on average for a per iod of 3 years. After a review of data, the a uthor stated (p. 227), \"the weight of the evi dence suggests that the long-term use of can nabis does not re sult in any severe or grossly debilitating impairment of cognitive function.\" She did note more sub tle dif ficulties in App. 365a atten traction, loose asso - ciations and intrusion errors in memory tasks. In a recent review of cognitive effects of can nabis (Solowij and Grenyer 2001), it was observed (p. 275), \"the long term risks for most users are not severe and their effects are relatively subtle. . . . \" Results from the current study seem to indicate similar find ings. As part of a Com prehensive Neuropsychological Evaluation, all sub jects were admin istered a battery of instruments including the WAIS -III, the WMS -III, the CVLT, the Trail Making Test A and B, Grooved Peg Board, Finger Tapping, and Cat egory Test, the Con trolled Oral Word Asso ci- ation Test, the Thurstone Word Fluency Test, a Cat e- gory Flu ency Test (Animal Naming), the WCST, the CPT-II, and the Beck De pression Inventory -2nd Edition (BDI -II). Comparing Patients A -D, it appears that all four do have at least mild dif ficulty with atten tion and con- centration, and verbal acquisition of varying complex new verbal material (as measured on th e CVLT), which is at least minimally impaired. Importantly, however, higher -level ex ecutive functions gen erally appear to be within normal limits in two of the sub - jects. Difficulties in atten tion and con centration as well as new complex verbal le arning may be directly related, and must be under stood in the con text of not only these sub jects' chronic can nabis use, but also their under lying chronic dis eases and clinical syndromes, with attendant fa tigue and pre occupation. Inter estingly, depressive symptoms are not currently noted at a clinical level in any of the sub jects despite App. 366a their chronic med ical con ditions or long -term can na- bis use. None dis played evi dence of social with draw al or apathy characteristic of the alleged \"a motivational syndrome.\" Rather, all were animated, engaging in conversation and demon strating an active involve - ment with their ongoing care and the current research. Overall, once more, no signif icant attributable neuropsychological seque lae are noted due to chronic cannabis usage. Review of Neuroimaging In 1971, it was reported that \"con sistent can nabis smoking\" of 3 -11 years in ten patients produced evi - dence for cerebral atrophy employing air enceph - alography (Campbell et al. 1971), an ex cruciatingly painful and long abandoned tech nique. Sub sequent study by Kuehnle et al. (1977) employing CT scans on 19 men with long durations of heavy can nabis usage failed to show any changes in the ventricles or sub - arachnoid spaces. T hey criticized the prior study for lacking con trols on ante cedent head trauma or other causes of neurological damage. In the same issue of the Journal of the Amer ican Med ical Asso ciation, Co et al. (1977) studied an addi tional 12 heavy cannabis smokers who dis played no CT abnormalities. In 1983, an addi tional 12 sub jects who smoked more than 1 g of can nabis daily for 10 years were studied by CT scans of the brain, and only one with concomitant history of alcoholism showed any abnormal ities compared to con trols (Hannerz and Hindmarsh 1983). Most recently, Block et al. (2000) employed auto - mated imaging anal ysis with MRI to ex amine 18 App. 367a young heavy users of can nabis. No abnormalities were ascertained. The authors stated (p. 495), \"frequent marijuana use does not produce clinically apparent MRI abnormalities or detectable global or regional changes in brain tissue volumes of gray or white matter, or both combined.\" It was recently noted (Solowij and Grenyer 2001, p. 270), \"There is no evi - dence from human studies of any structural brain damage following prolonged ex posure to cannabinoids.\" Despite this addi tional doc umentation, the claim of brain damage and cerebral atrophy remains a popular myth in prohibitionist rhetoric. Current MRI studies on Patients A -C with a Gen eral Electric Sigma LX MR 1.5 Tesla magnet system reveal no clear abnormalities. Patient A had age -compatible atrophy, and Patient C had minor tissue changes of a no n-spe- cific nature, commonly seen in middle -aged populations. Patient D has pre viously demon strated MRI brain lesions con sistent with MS, with possible improvement observed during the per iod of clinical cannabis usage. Review of Neurophysiology Tests In dis cussing the issue of can nabis and cerebral effects, Homer Reed observed (Reed 1975, pp. 122 -123), \"The asso ciation between many of the EEG measures used to indicate CNS changes and the clinical con di- tion of the patient is approx imately zero.\" That not - with stand ing, vari ous researchers have advanced numerous claims of per tinent EEG changes due to cannabis. Cohen (1976) noted dif ferences in computer - ized EEG measures of delta band power and theta band phase angle (lead/lag) relationship. No men tion App. 368a was made of the alleged signif icance of these tests, or of the results of stan dard EEG. All the Jamaican sub jects had EEG ex aminations (Rubin and Comitas 1975). As pre viously noted in other studies, 9 of 30 can nabis smokers had signif - icant low voltage fast activity in the beta range. Al - though this finding may indicate sedative effects of medication, it is often ascribed to a normal variant. Three of the 30 were said to have un equivocal focal abnormalities, but 4 of 30 con trols had similar find - ings, and another had dif fuse abnormalities. Overall, no signif icant dif ferences were noted between ganja smokers and con trols. Similarly, in Greece (Panayiotopoulos et al. 1977), 8.8% of 46 hash ish smokers had abnormal EEGs, while 15% of 40 normal con trols were so characterized. The authors stated (p. 62), \"We failed to find either an abnormality or an par ticular EEG change i n the resting EEG records of chronic hashish users. . . . \" Current results, per formed on a 21 -channel Nicolet Voyageur digital EEG system and read by EBR, con - firm the pre sence of low voltage fast activity in Patients A -C, and inter mittent sharp waves and rare subtle slowing in the left frontal area in Patient A. Age appro priate atrophy was seen in the same patient on MRI, but she has no history of seizures or CNS insults. There are no corresponding abnormalities on neurologi cal ex amination. Similar abnormalities are identified on EEGs of 6% of patients, whereas there is only a 0.5% pre valence of seizure dis orders in the gen - eral population. In essence, no EEG path ology of an attributable nature seems apparent in the study group on the basis of can nabis usage. App. 369a With respect to P300 responses, a type of electro - physiological event related potential, even greater caution is neces sary. This para meter is offered as an electro physiological measure of memory, inasmuch as prolongation of it s latency occurs with age. The test was popular in the 1980's as an objective test for dementia. Amplitude dif ferences have also been noted in dif ferent clinical con ditions, but were termed (Spehl - 1985, p. 370), \"of uncertain diag nostic importan ce because of the great normal variability the P300 amplitude.\" Overall, these issues and signif icant incidence of false positives and false negatives have largely relegated use of this tech nique to the sidelines as a clinical tool. Solowij (1998) stu died the P300 in chronic can na- bis users vs. con trols, and noted results felt to be indicative of (p. 150), \"inefficient pro cessing of infor - mation and impaired selective atten tion.\" These consisted of reduced processing negativity to relevant attend ed stimuli, inappro priately large processing negativity to a source of complex irrelevant stimuli, and reduced P300 amplitude to attended target stimuli to that of con trols. In con trast, Patrick et al. (1995) ex amined the P300 in psych ologically normal chronic can nabis users and con trolled the data for age. Re sults showed no amplitude dif ferences. More recent studies have shown signif icant reductions in P300 am plitude in schizophrenia (Martin - Loeches et al. 2001), but also in ciga rette smokers (Anokhin et al. 2000), with notable effects accord ing to motivational in struc tions (Carrillo -de-la-Pena and Cadaveira 2000), and even diurnal variations (Higuchi et al. 2000). App. 370a Our study employed a Nicolet Viking A -C displayed P300 latencies were well within norms for age -matched con trols (Figure 1). Review of Pulmonary Issues Pulmonary con cerns remain para mount in rela - tion to chronic can nabis smoking. Ex cellent recent reviews are avail able (Zimmer and Mor gan 1997 ; Tashkin 2001 ; Tashkin 2001). In brief, can nabis smoking produces an increase in cough and bronchitis symptoms, but to a lesser degree than in tobacco smokers (Sherrill et al. 1991). Daily ca nnabis smokers seek med ical care for smoking -associated health con - cerns at a slightly higher rate than non -smokers (Polen et al. 1993). In a large epi demiological study, cannabis use was asso ciated with little statistical association on tot al mortality in women, and non - AIDS mortality in men (Sidney et al. 1997). One of the primary asso ciated risks of tobacco smoking is the devel opment of emphysema and lesser declines in bronchial function over time. A care ful longitudinal study of chro nic smokers has demon - strated a longitudinal decline in the FEV 1 in tobacco smokers, but not heavy can nabis smokers (Tashkin et al. 1997). Some asso ciation of can nabis smoking has been observed to head and neck cancers (Zhang et al. 1999), and pre-cancerous cytological changes have been noted in the lungs in bronchoscopy studies (Fligiel et al. 1988), but to date, no cases of pulmonary carcinoma have been noted in can nabis-only smokers. App. 371a In ex amining the data from chronic can nabis use studies, in Jamaica, a slight downward trend not attaining statistical signif icance was noted on forced vital capacity (FVC) values (Rubin and Comitas 1975). A similar downward trend was observed on FEV 1 with out statistical sig nificance. No dif ferences between can nabis smokers, ers and non-smokers were observed on FEV 1/FVC ratios. Results of all tests may have been affected by con - comitant tobacco usage. The Greek studies did not closely ex amine pul- monary function, and al though an inc rease in bronchitis symptoms was noted in hashish smokers over abstainers, the former group also smoked more tobacco. Dif ferences were not statistically signif icant in any event (Boulougouris, Antypas, and Panayio - topoulos 1977). In the Costa studies, no spirometry measures were signif icantly dif ferent between can na- bis users and non -users. How ever, statis tical trends were, in fact, positive with respect to can nabis usage. Cannabis smokers dis played larger indices of small - airway patency. The authors suggested that in con - comitant smoking of tobacco, can nabis seemed to count eract the ex pected effects of tobacco on small air - ways. The author stated (Carter 1980, p. 171), \"at least it cannot be said of the us ers that they have suffered an additive of [sic -\"or\"] synergistic decrement in pulmonary function over that attributable to tobacco alone.\" In our Patients A -C, no ulti mate chest radiographic changes of signif icance were noted, despite a false - positive reading of pulmonary nodule in Patient C. It is of par ticular note that he has had a pre vious App. 372a bronchos -copy pro cedure with no reported cytological changes. Observed pulmonary function values in this cohort reveal no clear trends ex cept a slight downward trend in FEV 1 and FEV 1/FVC ratios, and per haps an increase in FVC (Patients A -C) (Table 3). Concomit ant tobacco smoking (Patients A, B, and D) complicates analysis. It is par ticularly inter esting that Patient B, a current con comitant smoker of to bacco dis played the best spirometry values, while those in Patient C, a never -smoker of tobacco were the worst. His under - lying con nective tis sue dis ease may have played an active role in this finding. His use of the lowest grade cannabis and highest amount per day are the more likely ex planation. Significant ques tions remain as to the role of low - grade NIDA can nabis as a con tributor to the above findings, which will sub sequent ly dis cussed. Review of Hematological Studies No effects on complete blood counts or hemoglobin were observed in the LaGuardia Com mission report (New York, NY). Mayor's com mittee on marihuana (Wallace and Cunningham 1944). In the Jamaican studies, slight increases were observe d in hematocrit and hemoglobin readings in can nabis smokers over controls, but results were affected by con comitant tobacco use (Rubin and Comitas 1975). No hema - tological data was obtained from the Greek studies. In Costa Rica, a downward trend was ob served in hematocrit read ings of can nabis smokers, but this was not statistically noteworthy (Carter 1980). App. 373a In our studies (Table 4), Patient B, a con comitant tobacco smoker, dis played a mild degree of poly - cythemia and slightly elevated WBC. No othe r hematological changes of any type were evident in the other three patients. Review of Immunological Parameters Immune system damage remains an area of con - tention with respect to can nabis usage (Zimmer and Morgan 1997), but one in which there is con siderably more heat than light. A closer ex amination of the avail able literature may allay con cern. In the chronic use studies in Jamaica, no decrement was observed in can nabis smokers vs. con - trols in either lymphocyte or neutrophils counts (Rubi n and Comitas 1975). Neither were signif icant changes noted in the data in Costa Rica (Carter 1980). In the 94 -Day Can nabis Study, initial acute low values were ob served in T cell counts, but these returned to normal over the course of the testing (Cohen 1976). A closer ex amination of the per tinent literature raises con cerns on theoretical levels to a greater degree than practical ones. Ex cellent re views are avail able (Klein, Friedman, and Specter 1998 ; Hollister 1992 ; Cabral 2001 ; Cabral 2001). Early reports of inhibition of cell mediated immunity in can nabis smokers (Nahas et al. 1974) were refuted by later studies in which no impairment of lymphocytic response to phytohemagglutinin in hashish smokers was observed (Kaklamani et al. 1978). App. 374a A semi nal review of the topic was under taken by Hollister (1992), who stated (p. 159), \"evi dence of altered immune functions is derived mainly from in vitro tests or ex vivo ex periments, which employed doses of cannabinoids far in ex cess o f those that pre - vail during social use of marijuana.\" More recently, Klein, Friedman and Specter (1998) have similarly noted (p. 102), \"Al though cannabinoids modulate im - mune cell function, it is also clear that these cells are relatively resistant to th e drugs in than many effects appear to be relatively small and to tally reversible, occur at con centration higher than needed to induce psych oactivity (> 10 \u00b5M or > 5 mg/kg), and occur following treat ment with non psychoactive cannabinoid analogues.\" Th ey added (p. 102), \"The public health risk of smoking marijuana in terms of increased susceptibility to infections, especially oppor tunistic infections, is still unclear.\" Finally, despite con cerns raised by THC effects on immunity in animals and in vitro, Cabral and Dove Pettit (1998) admit ted (p. 116), \"Definitive data which directly link marijuana use to increased suscep tibility to infection in humans currently is unavail able.\" A par ticular public health con cern surrounds cannabis effects on HIV/AIDS. Four studies among others may reduce related con cern. Kaslow et al. (1989) demon strated no can nabis acceler - ated immunodeficiency para meters in HIV -positive Di Franco et al. (1996) ascertained no accelera tion of HIV to full -blown AIDS in can nabis smokers. Whitfield, Bechtel and Starich (1997) observed no deleterious effects of can nabis usage in HIV/AIDS patients, even those with the lowest CD4 counts. App. 375a Finally, Abrams et al. (2000) studied the effects o f can- nabis smoking on HIV positive patients on protease inhib itor drugs in a prospective randomized, partially blinded placebo -controlled trial. No adverse effects on CD4 counts were observed secondary to can nabis. In our studies of four sub jects (Table 4), Patient B had an elevated WBC count, probably attributable to the stress of phlebotomy, but with out accom pany ing disorders of cell count dif ferential. All patients had CD4 counts well within normal limits. Review of Endocrine Functi on Topical reviews of this topic are con tained in two recent publications (Murphy 2001 ; Zimmer and Morgan 1997). As with other physiological systems, much data is based on animal studies, and early claims of dele - terious effects on acute endocrine functi on are not necessarily sup ported by sub sequent inves tigations or chronic use studies. One long held claim is the production of gyne - comastia in males asso ciated with can nabis use. A case study or 3 can nabis smokers with this malady was reporte d by Aliapoulios (1972). A more thor ough inves tigation a few years later failed to show any dif ferences in can nabis use in affected males between users and con trols (Cates and Pope 1977). Similarly, Kolodny et al. (1974) reported decrea sed testosterone levels in chronic marijuana smokers, while no dif ferences in testosterone or luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were identified in a 3 -week trial of smokers vs. non -smokers (Mendelson et al. 1978). App. 376a LH levels in menopausal women showed no signif icant changes after can nabis usage (Mendelson et al. 1985), but the next year, a similar group noted a 30% suppression of LH in women by smoking a single cannabis cigarette during the luteal phase (Mendels on et al. 1986). Subsequent ly, a more in -depth study of both sexes was under taken to assess mul tiple hormone effects comparing sub jects with dif ferent lev els of can nabis usage vs. con trols (Block, Farinpour, and Schlechte 1991). testosterone, LH, FSH, prolactin or cortisol in young women and men. Jamaican chronic use studies were con fined to ex - aminations of thyroxine and steroid ex cretion with no signif icant find ings observed due to can nabis use (Rubin and Comitas 1975). In the 94 -Day Can nabis Study, acute drops in testosterone and LH levels were noted after smoking a can nabis cigarette (Cohen 1976). Sub sequent drops in testosterone levels were noted after the 5th week of daily usag e. LH levels fell after the 4th week and FSH after the 8th week to unspecified degrees. In Costa Rica, no dif ferences were noted in male testosterone levels between abstainers and can nabis smokers stratified accord ing to amount of use (Carter 1980). S imilarly, fertility was unimpaired, with both groups having identical numbers of progeny. The author stated (p. 172), \"These find ings cast serious doubt on cause -and-effect rela tionship be tween marihuana smoking and plasma testosterone level in long-term use.\" App. 377a Zimmer and Morgan (1997) summarized their observations by stat ing (p. 92), \"There is no scientific evidence that marijuana delays ado lescent sexual devel opment, has a feminizing effect on males, or a masculinizing effect on females.\" The latt er state ment would seem to be borne out by our find ings. While one male sub ject had a minor degree of gynecomastia asso ciated with obesity, none of the Patients A -D dis played any abnormal values in any endocrine measure (Table 5). Patient A has two children, Patient B has three, and Patient D had one by choice. Problems in the Compassionate IND Program All four patients described varying degrees of logistical dif ficulties in obtaining their medicine. All have to travel or make special arrang ements with their study phy sician, who is the arbi ter of the potency of received material. All described incidents of inadequate supply or pro vision of inferior quality can - nabis. All have had to sup plement their supplies of cannabis from illega l black market sources at times. All have ex perienced inconveniences or security concerns when traveling. One, Patient C, was arrested, detained, and had some of his medicine per manently confiscated with out replacement. Patients A -C decried the lack of an official identity card that might be readily recog nized and accepted by law enforce ment and security per sonnel. Rather, all used combinations of letters and other doc - uments to con vey their legal status to inter ested author ities, often to t he accompa niment of much doubt and suspicion. All describe signif icant worry App. 378a and anxiety about their medicine supplies, and whether official promises of con tinuation of the program will be honored. A para mount issue affecting the Compassionate IND pat ients re volves around can nabis quality. It has been well estab lished that recre ational can nabis smokers pre fer higher potency materials (Herning, Hooker, and Jones 1986 ; Chait and Burke 1994 ; Kelly et al. 1997). The same per tains for most clinical can - nabis patients. Chait and Pierri (1989) published a detailed anal - ysis of NIDA mari juana cigarettes that is worthy of review in this con text. NIDA marijuana is grown out - side, one crop per biennium, harvested from a 5 -acre facility at the Uni versity of Mississippi. Average yield of \"manicured material\" is 270 g per plant or 270 g per square foot (letter from NIDA, Steven Gust to Chris Conrad, August 18, 1999). Material is shipped to the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina where it is chopped and rolled on modified tobacco cigarette machines, then stored partially dehydrated and frozen. Cigarettes average 800 -900 g in weight. Mate - rial re quires rehydration before usage, w hich the IND patients usually achieve by storage over night in a refrigerated plastic bag with leaves of lettuce. As of 1999 (letter, Steven Gust to EBR, June 7, 1999), NIDA had avail able can nabis cigarettes of 1.8%, 2.8%, 3.0%, and 3.4% c up to 5% THC con tent. Other cannabinoid components were not quantitated. It was fur ther stated that the strongest material was not pro vided to patients in their cigarette shipments because it was too sticky and would inter fere with the rol ling machine's functioning App. 379a (Personal Commu nication to EBR, Steven Gust, Decem ber 1999). Static burn rates of NIDA can nabis cigarettes were inversely related to potency (Chait and Pierri 1989), while the number of puffs that could be drawn from each cigarette averaged 8.8. While total particulate matter increased with potency, arguably less smoked material is neces sary for medicinal effect. Of more concern, carbon mono xide levels were highest in the lower potency material ; that is, CO was inversely propor tional to THC con tent. Finally, test sub jects in their study of NIDA can nabis reported (pp. 66 -67), \"that the marijuana is inferior in sensory qualities (taste, harshness) than the marijuana that they smoke out side the laboratory. Some have stated that it was the worst marijuana they had ever sampled, or that it tasted 'chemically treated.' \" All the study pat ients criticize the paper employed to roll the can nabis cigarettes as harsh, and tasting poorly. NIDA can nabis cigarettes re semble Pall Mall . . . brand tobacco cigarettes with out the logo (Figure 3). All study patients clean their can nabis and re -roll the material to varying degrees, al though at least one former IND patient, now deceased, used the NIDA cigarettes unaltered. NIDA can nabis is shipped to patients in labeled metal canisters con taining 300 cigarettes (Figure 4), and material is fre quently two or more years old upon receipt. Even under optimal storage con ditions, a certain degree of oxidation of cannabinoids can be ex - pected (Grotenhermen 2001). Most con sumers pre fer a supply of cured can nabis that is as fresh as possible. App. 380a A clo se inspection of the con tents of NIDA - supplied can nabis cigarettes reveals them to be a crude mixture of leaf with abundant stem and seed components (Figures 5 -6). The odor is green and herbal in charac ter. The resultant smoke is thick, acrid, and pervasive. In con trast, a typical sinsemilla \"bud\" is seedless, covered with visi ble glandular trichomes (see journal cover), and emits a strong lemony or piney terpenoid scent. The smoke is also less dis turbing from a sensory standpoint to most observe rs. Whittle, Guy, and Robson (2001) describe in detail the markedly con trasting steps under taken in a government approved clinical can nabis program in the United Kingdom. Their material is organically grown in soil with no chemical treat ment under con- trolled indoor con ditions. All male plants are eliminated, and only unfertilized female flowering tops are harvested for fur ther processing. This material is assayed for cannabinoid and terpenoid con tent, with con trolled ratios through genetic selection of seed strains before ex traction. THC yields obtained are routinely 15 -20% (Personal to clinical cannabis con sump cannabinoid and terpenoid component admin istration to prospective clinical patients out pyrolysis 1996a admin istration of can nabis ex tracts is another most promising tech nique of clinical can na- bis admin istration (Whittle, Guy, and Robson 2001). App. 381a Three of the four study sub jects have employed Marinol . . . , and found it inadequate or a poor sub sti- tute for can nabis in symptomatic relief of their clinical syndromes. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Cannabis smoking, even of a crude, low -grade product, pro vides effec tive sym ptomatic relief of pain, muscle spasms, and intra -ocular pre ssure elevations in selected patients failing other modes of treat ment. 2. These clinical can nabis patients are able to reduce or eliminate other pre scription medicines and their accom panyin g side effects. 3. Clinical can nabis pro vides an improved quality of life in these pa tients. 4. The side effect profile of NIDA can nabis in chronic usage sug gests some mild pulmonary risk. 5. No malignant deter ioration has been observed. 6. No consistent or attributable neuropsychological or neurological deter ioration has been observed. 7. No endocrine, hematological or immunological sequelae have been observed. 8. Improvements in a clinical can nabis program would include a ready and con sistent supply of sterilized, potent, organically grown unfertilized female flowering top material, thoroughly cleaned of ex tra- neous inert fibrous matter. 9. It is the authors' opin ion that the Compas - sionate IND program should be reopened and ex - tended to other patients in need of clini cal can nabis. App. 382a 10. Failing that, local, state and fed eral laws might be amended to pro vide regulated and monitored clinical can nabis to suitable candidates.

App. 383a IN THE MATTER OF MARIJUANA RESCHEDULING, DEA DKT.NO. : 86-22 (1988) (RELEVANT EXCERPTS) UNITED STATES DEPART MENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforce ment Admin istration ________________________ In The Matter of MARIJUANA RESCHEDULING PETITION, ________________________ No. Docket No. 86 -22 ________________________ OPINION AND RECOMMENDED RULING , FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE I. Introduction This is a rulemaking pur suant to the Admin istra- tive Pro cedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551, et to deter mine whether the marijuana plant (Cannabis sativa L) considered as a whole may law fully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the schedules estab - lished by the Con trolled Substances Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. None of the parties is to \"legalize\" marijuana gen erally or for recrea tional pur - poses. Plac ement in Schedule II would mean, essentially, that phy sicians in the United States would not violate Fed eral law by prescribing marijuana for their patients for legit imate therapeutic pur poses. App. 384a It is con trary to Fed eral law for phy sicians to do this as long as marijuana remains in Schedule I. This pro ceeding had its origins on May 18, 1972 when the National Organ ization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and two other groups sub - mitted a petition to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dang erous Drugs (BNDD) 1, predecessor [ . . . ] VIII. Accepted Safety for Use Under Medical Super - vision With respect to whether or not there is \"a lack of accepted safety for use of [marijuana] under med ical supervision\", the record shows the following fact s to be uncontroverted. Findings of Fact 1. Richard J. Gralla, M.D., an oncologist and Professor of Medicine who was an Agency witness, accepts that in treating cancer patients oncologists can use the cannabinoids with safety despite their side effects. 2. Andrew T. Weil, M.D., who now prac tices medicine in Tucson, Arizona and is on the faculity of the College of Medicine, Uni versity of Arizona, was a member of the first team of researchers to per form a Federal Gov ernment auth orized study into the effects of marijuana on human sub jects. This team made its study in 1968. These researchers deter mined that 1 The powers and author ity granted by the Act to the Attor ney General were delegated to the Direc tor of BNOD and sub se- quent ly to the Administrator of DEA. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100, et seq. App. 385a marijuana could be safely used under med ical super - vision. In the 2 0 years since then Dr. Weil has seen no information that would cause him to reconsider that con - clusion. There is no ques tion in his mind but that marijuana is safe for use under appro priate med ical supervision. 3. The most obvious con cern when dealing with drug safety is the possibility of lethal effects. Can the drug cause death? 4. Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal effects. But marijuana is not such a substance. There is no record in the extensive med ical literature describing a proven, doc umented cannabis -induced fatality. 5. This is a remarkable state ment. First, the record on marijuana encompasses 5,000 years of human experience. Second, marijuana is now used daily by enormous numbers of people throughout the worl d. Estimates suggest that from twenty million to fifty million Amer icans routinely, albeit illegally, smoke marijuana without the benefit of direct med ical supervision. Yet, despite this long history of use and the extraordinarily high numbers of socia l smokers, there are simply no credible med ical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a single death. 6. By contrast aspirin, a commonly used, over - the-counter medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year. 7. Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called an LD -50. The LD -50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced toxicity. A number of researchers have attempted to deter mine App. 386a marijuana's LD -50 rating i n test animals, without success. Simply stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to induce death. 8. At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD- 50 is around 1 :20,000 or 1 :40,000. In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is con tained in one marijuana cigarette. NIDA -supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approx imately .9 grams. A smoker would theoretically have to co nsume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response. 9. In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal response as a result of drug -related toxicity. 10. Another common med ical way to deter mine drug safe ty is called the therapeuic ratio. This ratio defines the difference between a therapeutically effec tive dose and a dose which is capable of inducing adverse effects. 11. A commonly used over -the-counter product like aspirin has a therapeutic ratio of ar ound 1 :20. Two aspirins are the re commended dose for adult patients. Twenty times this dose, forty aspirins, may cause a lethal reaction in some patients, and will almost certainly cause gross injury to the digestive system, including extensive internal bleeding. 12. The therapeutic ratio for prescribed drugs is commonly around 1 :10 or lower. Valium, a commonly used prescriptive drug, may cause very serious bio- logical damage if patients use ten times the re com- mended (therapeutic) dose. App. 387a 13. There are, of course, prescriptive drugs which have much lower therapeutic ratios. Many of the drugs used to treat patients with cancer, glaucoma and mul tiple sclerosis are highly toxic. The therapeutic ratio of some of the drugs used in antineoplastic therapies, for example, are regarded as extremely toxic poisons with therapeutic ratios that may fall below 1:1.5. These drugs also have very low LD -50 ratios and can result in toxic, even lethal reactions, while being properly employed. 14. By contrast, ma rijuana's therapeutic ratio, like its LD -50, is impossible to quantify because it is so high. 15. In strict med ical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating ten raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. 16. Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational anal ysis marijuana can be safely used wit hin a supervised routine of med - ical care. 17. Some of the drugs most widely used in chemotherapy treat ment of cancer have adverse effects as follows : Ciplatin , one of the most powerful chemo - therapeuic agents used on humans -may cause deafness ; may lead to life -threatening kidney difficulties and kidney fail ure; adversely affects the body's immune system, sup pressing the patient's ability to fight a host of common infections. App. 388a Nitrogen Mustard , a drug used in therapy for Hodgkins disease -nauseates ; so toxic to the skin that, if dropped on the skin, this chemical literally eats it away along with other tissues it contacts ; if patient's intra - venous lead slips during treat ment and this drug gets on or under the skin the patient may suffer s erious injury including tempo- rary, and in extreme cases, permanent, loss of use of the arm. Procarbizine , also used for Hodgkins disease - has known psychogenic, i.e., emotional, effects. Cytoxin , also known as Cyclophosphanide - suppresses patient's immune system response ; results in serious bone marrow depletion ; studies indicate this drug may also cause other cancers, including cancers of the bladder. Adriamycan , has numerous adverse effects ; is difficult to employ in long term therapies because it destroys the heart muscle. While each of these agents has its par ticular adverse effects, as indicated above, they also cause a number of similar, disturbing adverse effects. Most of these drugs cause hair loss. Studies increasingly indicate all of these drugs may cause other forms of cancer. Death due to kidney, heart or respiratory fail ure is a very real possibility with all of these agents and the margin for error is minimal. Similarly, there is a danger of overdosing a patient weakened by his cancer. Put simply, there is very great risk asso ciated with . ] App. INVITATION FROM CONGRESSMAN J.

To preserve these articles as they orig - inally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or up - date them. Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other proble ms; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions. The diaries of H.R. Haldeman, President Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff until the Watergate scandal prompted Mr. Nixon to dismiss him, include refer ences to Mr. Nixon's believing that there was \"total Jewish domination of the media\" and that \"the whole problem is really the blacks.\" \"The Haldeman Diaries,\" being published today by G.P. Putnam's Sons, are drawn from audio recordings and Mr. Haldeman's daily diary entries. In one entry, Mr. Haldeman, referring to the President as \"P,\" said : \"P emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to. Pointed out that there has never in history been an adequate black nation, and they are the only race of which this is true. Says Africa App. 392a is hopeless. The worst there is Liberia, which we built.\" In another segment Mr. Haldeman states : \"There was considerable disc ussion of the terrible problem arising from the total Jewish domination of the media and agreement that this is something that would have to be dealt with.\" Mr. Haldeman's entry for Feb. 26, 1970, stated that Mr. Nixon \"really raged again against United States Jews\" and that the President had ordered his chief of staff \"not to let any Jews see him about the Middle East.\" Mr. Haldeman noted that the outburst was in the presence of the national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, who is Jewish. Plot to Impu gn Kennedy In an entry on June 23, 1971, Mr. Haldeman dictated a passage about how to use reports of sexual escapades against Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat whom Mr. Nixon considered a likely rival for the Presidency in 1972. \"We nee d to take advantage of this oppor tunity and get him in a compromising sit uation if we can,\" Mr. Haldeman said. Mr. Nixon died last month. Mr. Haldeman died last year. Mr. Haldeman's recollections also indicate that Mr. Nixon had wanted his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson, to persuade Democratic senators to halt their Watergate inquiry and had threatened to reveal that Mr. Johnson bugged the Nixon campaign plane in 1968. App. 393a Mr. Haldeman recorded that on June 25, 1972, eight days after the Watergate break -in set in motion the events that eventually led Mr. Nixon to resign, the President was con cerned about \"the Martha Mitchell problem.\" Mrs. Mitchell, the wife of Attor ney General John N. Mitchell, Mr. Nixon's campaign manager and mentor, had a habit of calling reporters, especially Helen Thomas, the White House corres pond ent of United Press International. Martha Mitchell's Tele - phones In one entry Mr. Haldeman said Mrs. M itchell had told Ms. Thomas that if Mr. Mitchell did not get out of politics \"she was going to kick him out of the house, but her phones were then pulled out either by her or someone in her room.\" After noting that Mrs. Mitchell was demanding that her tele phone be reinstalled, Mr. Haldeman said, \"She's now threatening that if they don't get her phones in she's going to blow the whole Republican deal, what ever that means.\" The next day Mr. Haldeman recorded that it was Mr. Nixon's opinion that \"John's got t o close her down somehow or lock her up, but he can't just leave her speaking out like this ; it's going to create a major national problem.\" Later, Mr. Haldeman learned that it had been an agent of the Fed eral Bureau of Inves tigation who had pulled ou t the phone. \"She had a monumental tantrum, started throwing things at him, demolishing the room,\" Mr. Haldeman said. \"They locked her in. She busted the window with her hand, cut herself App. 394a badly. They had to get a doctor, who had to throw her on the bed and give her a shot in order to subdue her.\" Mr. Mitchell resigned as head of the re -election campaign on July 1, saying that he had \"to meet the happiness\" of his wife and daughter. Mrs. Mitchell died in 1976, and Mr. Mitchell in 1988. Asked for comment on t he racial state ments the Haldeman diaries attributed to Mr. Nixon, the direc tor of the Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., John H. Taylor, said, \"Politics and anti -Semitism are two different things.\" Mr. Nixon's state ments about blacks and Jews \"should be viewed strictly in a political context,\" he said. \"I had the privilege of serving him for 15 years and never heard him make an anti -Semitic state ment,\" Mr. Taylor said. [ . . . ] App. 395a HARPERS MAGAZINE ARTICLE \u2014 \"LEGALIZE IT ALL : HOW TO WIN THE WAR ON DRUGS\" (APRIL 1, 2016) By Dan Baum ________________________ In 1994, John Ehrlichman, the Watergate co - conspirator, unlocked for me one of the great mysteries of modern Amer ican history : How did the United States entangle itself in a policy of drug prohibition that has yielded so much misery and so few good results? Amer icans have been criminalizing psy cho- active substances since San Francisco's anti -opium law of 1875, but it was Ehrlichman's boss, Richard Nixon, who declared the first \"war on drugs\" and set the country on the wildly punitive and counter - productive path it still pursues. I'd tracked Ehrl ich- man, who had been Nixon's domestic -policy adviser, to an engineering firm in Atlanta, where he was working on minority recruitment. I barely recog nized him. He was much heavier than he'd been at the time of the Watergate scandal two decades earlier, a nd he wore a mountain -man beard that extended to the middle of his chest. At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition. I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky ques tions that he impatiently waved away. \"You want to know what this was really all about?\" he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in fed eral prison, had little left to pro tect. \"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two App. 396a enemies : the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to asso ciate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing bo th heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\" I must have looke d shocked. Ehrlichman just shrugged . Then he looked at his watch, handed me a signed copy of his steamy spy novel, The Com pany , and led me to the door. Nixon's invention of the war on drugs as a political tool was cynical, but every president since \u2014 Democrat and Republican alike \u2014has found it equally useful for one reason or another. Meanwhile, the growing cost of the drug war is now impossible to ignore : billions of dollars wasted, bloodshed in Latin America and on the streets of our own cities, and millions of lives destroyed by draconian punishment that doesn't end at the prison gate ; one of every eight black men has been disenfranchised because of a felony con viction. As long ago as 1949, H. L. Mencken identified in Amer icans \"the haunting fear that someone, some - where, may be happy,\" an astute articulation of our weirdly Puritan need to criminalize people's incli na- tion to adjust how they feel. The desire for altered states of con sciousness creates a market, and in suppressing that market we h ave created a class of genuine bad guys \u2014pushers, gangbangers, smugglers, killers. Addiction is a hideous condition, but it's rare. App. 397a Most of what we hate and fear about drugs \u2014the violence, the overdoses, the criminality \u2014derives from prohibition, not drugs. A nd there will be no victory in this war either ; even the Drug Enforce ment Admin is- tration concedes that the drugs it fights are becoming cheaper and more easily avail able. Now, for the first time, we have an oppor tunity to change course. Experiments in alter natives to harsh prohibition are already under way both in this country and abroad. Twenty -three states, as well as the Dis - trict of Columbia, allow med ical marijuana, and four\u2014Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska \u2014 along with D.C., have legalized pot altogether. Several more states, including Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada, will likely vote in Novem - ber whether to follow suit. P ortugal has decriminalized not only marijuana but cocaine and heroin, as well as all other drugs. In Vermont, heroin addicts can avoid jail by com mitting to state -funded treat ment. Canada began a pilot program in Vancouver in 2014 to allow doctors to pre scribe pharmaceutical -quality heroin to addicts, Switzerland has a similar program, and the Home Affairs Com mittee of Britain's House of Commons has re commended that the United Kingdom do likewise. Last July, Chile began a legis lative process to legalize both medicinal and recreational marijuana use and allow households to grow as many as six plants. After telling the BBC in Decem ber that \"if you fight a war for forty years and don't win, you have to sit down and think about other things to do that might be more effec tive,\" Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos legalized med ical marijuana by decree. In Novem ber, the Mexican Supreme Court elevated the debate to a new plane by ruling that the prohibition of App. 398a marijuana consumption violated the Mexican Con sti- tution by interfering with \"the personal sphere,\" the \"right to dignity,\" and the right to \"personal autonomy.\" The Supreme Court of Brazil is considering a similar argu ment. Depending on how the issue is framed, legalization of all drug s can appeal to conservatives, who are instinc tively suspicious of bloated budgets, excess gov - ernment author ity, and intrusions on indi vidual liberty, as well as to liberals, who are horrified at police overreach, the brutalization of Latin America, and the criminalization of entire generations of black men. It will take some courage to move the con versation beyond marijuana to ending all drug prohibitions, but it will take less, I suspect, than most politicians believe. It's already politically permissible to criticize mandatory min imums, mass marijuana -possession arrests, police militarization, and other excesses of the drug war ; even former attor ney general Eric Holder and Michael Botticelli, the new drug czar \u2014a recovering alcoholic \u2014do so. Few in public life appear eager to defend the status quo. This month, the General Assembly of the United Nations will be gathering for its first dr ug conference since 1998. The motto of the 1998 meeting was \"A Drug -Free World \u2014We Can Do It!\" With all due respect, U.N., how'd that work out for you? Today the U.N. confronts a world in which those who have suffered the most have lost faith in the old str ong-arm ideology. That the tide was beginning to turn was evident at the 2012 Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, when Latin Amer ican leaders for the first time openly discussed \u2014much to the public discomfort of President Obama \u2014whether App. 399a legalizi ng and regulating drugs should be the hemi - sphere's new approach. When the General Assembly convenes, it also will have to contend with the startling fact that four states and the capital city of the world's most zealous drug enforcer have fully legalized marijuana. \"We're confronted now with the fact that the U.S. cannot enforce domestically what it promotes elsewhere,\" a member of the U.N.'s International Narcotics Control Board, which monitors international compliance with the conference's directives, to ld me. Shortly before Oregon, Alaska, and the Dis trict of Columbia added them selves to the legal -marijuana list, the State Depart ment's chief drug -control official, William Brown - field, abruptly reversed his stance. Whereas before he had said that the \"drug control conventions cannot be changed,\" in 2014 he admit ted that things had changed : \"How could I, a repre sentative of the govern- ment of the United States of America, be intolerant of a government that permits any experi mentation with legalization of marijuana if two of the fifty states of the United States of America have chosen to walk down that road?\" Throughout the drug -reform community, jaws dropped. As the once -unimaginable step of ending the war on drugs shimmers into view, it's time to shift the con- versation from why to how. To realize benefits from ending drug prohibition will take more than simply declaring that drugs are legal. The risks are tremendous. Deaths from heroin overdose in the United States rose 500 percent from 2001 to 2014, a staggering increase, and deaths from prescription drugs \u2014which are already legal and regulated \u2014shot up almost 300 percent, proving that where opioids are App. 400a concerned, we seem to be inept not only when we prohibit but also when we regulate. A sharp increase in drug dependence or overdoses that followed the legalization of drugs would be a public -health disaster, and it could very well knock the world back into the same counterproductive prohibitionist mind -set from which we appear finally to be emerging. To minimize harm and maximize order, we'll have to design better systems than we have now for licensing, stan dardizing , inspecting, distributing, and taxing dangerous drugs. A million choices will arise, and we probably won't make any good deci sions on the first try. Some things will get better ; some things will get worse. But we do have experience on which to draw \u2014from the end of Prohibition, in the 1930s, and from our recent history. Ending drug prohibition is a matter of imagination and mana gement, two things on which Amer icans justifiably pride them selves. We can do this. Let's start with a ques tion that is too seldom asked : What exactly is our drug problem? It isn't simply drug use. Lots of Amer icans drink, but relatively few become alcoholics. It's hard to imagine people enjoying a little heroin now and then, or a hit of methamphetamine, without going off the deep end, but they do it all the time. The gov ernment's own data, from the Substance A buse and Mental Health Services Admin istration, shatters the myth of \"instantly addictive\" drugs. Al though about half of all Amer icans older than twelve have tried an illegal drug, only 20 percent of those have used one in the past month. In the majo rity of those monthly -use cases, the drug was cannabis. Only tiny percentages of people who have sampled one of the Big Four \u2014 heroin, cocaine, crack, and methamphetamine \u2014have App. 401a used that drug in the past month. (For heroin, the number is 8 percent ; for cocain e, 4 percent ; for crack, 3 percent ; for meth, 4 percent.) It isn't even clear that using a drug once a month amounts to having a drug problem. The portion of lifetime alcohol drinkers who become alcoholics is about 8 percent, and we don't think of someone who drinks alcohol monthly as an alcoholic. In other words, our real drug problem \u2014debilitating addiction \u2014is relatively small. One longtime drug - policy researcher, Peter Reuter of the Uni versity of Maryland, puts the number of people addicted to hard drug s at fewer than 4 million, out of a population of 319 million. Addiction is a chronic illness during which relapses or flare -ups can occur, as with diabetes, gout, and high blood pressure. And drug dependence can be as hard on friends and family as it is o n the afflicted. But dealing with addiction shouldn't re quire spending $40 billion a year on enforce ment, incar cerating half a million, and quashing the civil liberties of everybody, whether drug user or not. It's possible, of course, that one reason we have a relatively small number of drug addicts is precisely that the most addictive drugs are illegal. If cocaine were to be legalized, says Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at New York Uni versity who has been a critic of the war on d rugs since the 1970s, there's no evidence indicating that the number of cocaine abusers would be less than the number of alcoholics, or about 17.6 million. Moreover, legalizing cocaine might worsen both cocaine addiction and alcoholism, Kleiman adds. \"A limit to alcoholism is you fall asleep. Cocaine fixes that. And a limit to cocaine addiction is you can't sleep. Alcohol fixes that.\" App. 402a Kleiman's prediction of a big increase in post - legalization addiction rates seems intuitively cor rect. Common sense and de cency dictate that any plan for legalizing drugs ought to make provisions for a rise in dependence. Millions of addicts already go untreated in the United States. Al though treat ment is a bargain \u2014the government estimates that for every dollar spent on drug treat ment, seven are saved \u2014treat ment and prevention get only 45 percent of the fed eral drug budget while enforce ment and interdiction get 55 percent, and that's not including the stupendous cost of incarcerating drug offenders. Treat ment may beco me more avail able now that the Affordable Care Act re- quires many insurers to pay for mental -health services, including drug addiction, at parity with physical illnesses. Training effec tive treat ment pro viders is time -consuming and expensive, but the b illions freed up by the end of enforce ment and mass incarceration could be used to help address that need. It is also not a certainty that legalizing drugs would result in the huge spike in addiction that Kleiman predicts. In fact, some data argue against it. The Netherlands effec tively decriminalized marijuana use and possession in 1976, and Australia, the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, and New York State all followed suit. In none of these juris dictions did marijuana then become a significant health or public - order problem. But marijuana's easy ; it isn't phy sically addictive. So consider Portugal, which in 2001 took the radical step of decriminalizing not only pot but cocaine, heroin, and the rest of the drug spectrum. Decriminalization in Portugal means that the drugs remain technically prohibited \u2014selling th em is a major crime \u2014but the purchase, use, and possession of up to App. 403a ten days' supply are admin istrative offenses. No other country has gone so far, and the results have been astounding. The expected wave of drug tourists never materialized. Teenage use w ent up shortly before and after decriminalization, but then it settled down, perhaps as the novelty wore off. (Teenagers \u2014particu- larly eighth graders \u2014are considered harbingers of future societal drug use.) The lifetime prevalence of adult drug use in Portugal rose slightly, but problem drug use \u2014that is, habitual use of hard drugs \u2014declined after Portugal decriminalized, from 7.6 to 6.8 per 1,000 people. Compare that with nearby Italy, which didn't decrim - inalize , where the rates rose from 6.0 to 8.6 per 1 ,000 people over the same time span. Because addicts can now legally obtain sterile syringes in Portugal, decriminalization seems to have cut radically the number of addicts infected with H.I.V., from 907 in 2000 to 267 in 2008, while cases of full -blown A IDS among addicts fell from 506 to 108 during the same period. The new Portuguese law has also had a striking effect on the size of the country's prison population. The number of inmates serving time for drug offenses fell by more than half, and today they make up only 21 percent of those incarcerated. A similar reduction in the United States would free 260,000 people \u2014the equivalent of letting the entire population of Buffalo out of jail. When applying the lessons of Portugal to the United States, it's impo rtant to note that the Portuguese didn't just throw open access to dangerous drugs without planning for people who couldn't handle them. Portugal poured money into drug treat ment, App. 404a expanding the number of addicts served by more than 50 percent. It estab lished Com missions for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, each of which is composed of three people \u2014often a doctor, a social worker, and an attor ney\u2014who are auth orized to refer a drug user to treat ment and in some cases impose a relatively small fine. N or did Portugal's decrimi na- lization experiment happen in a vacuum. The country has been increasing its spending on social services since the 1970s, and even instituted a guaran teed minimum income in the late 1990s. The rapid expan - sion of the welfare state may have contributed to Portugal's well -publicized economic troubles, but it can probably also share credit for the drop in problem drug use. Decriminalization has been a success in Portugal. Nobody there argues seriously for abandoning the policy, and being identified with the law is good politics : during his successful 2009 reelection campaign, former prime minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates boasted of his role in estab lishing it. So why doesn't the United States decriminalize? It's an attractive idea : Lay off the innocent users and pitiable addicts ; keep going after the really bad guys who import and push the drugs. But decriminalization doesn't do enough. As successful as Portugal's experiment has been, the Lisbon gov ernment still has no control ove r drug purity or dosage, and it doesn't make a dime in tax revenue from the sale of drugs. Organized crime still controls Portugal's supply and distribution, and drug -related violence, corruption, and gunned -up law enforce ment con tinue. For these reason s, the effect of drug decriminalization on crime in Portugal is murky. Some crimes strongly asso ciated App. 405a with drug use increased after decriminalization \u2014 street robberies went up by 66 percent, auto theft by 15 percent \u2014but others dropped. (Thefts from homes fell by 8 percent, thefts from busi nesses by 10 percent.) A study by the Portuguese police found an increase in opportunistic crimes and a reduction in premeditated and violent crimes, but it could not conclude that the changes were due to the decriminalization of drugs. Heavy -handed enforce ment also re quires favoring scare tactics over honest inquiry, experimentation, and data gathering ; and scare tactics are no way to deal with substances as dangerous as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Portuguese -style decriminalization also wouldn't work in the United States because Portugal is a small country with national laws and a national police force, whereas the United States is a patchwork of juris dic- tions \u2014thousands of overlapping law -enforce ment agencies and prosecutors at the local, county, state, and fed eral levels. Philadelphia's city council, for example, voted to decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana in June 2014, and within a month state police had arrested 140 peo ple for exactly that offense. \"State law trumps city ordi nances,\" Police Com missioner Charles Ramsey told the Philadelphia Inquirer . And while marijuana may be legal in four states and D.C., under fed eral law it is still as illegal as heroin or LSD \u2014and even more tightly con trolled than cocaine or pharmaceutical opioids. The Obama Admin istration has decided, for the moment, not to interfere with the states that have legalized marijuana, but times change and so do admin istra- tions. We cannot begi n to enjoy the bene fits of managing drugs as a matter of health and safety, App. 406a instead of as a matter of law enforce ment, until the drugs are legalized at every level of Amer ican jurisprudence, just as alcohol was re -legalized when the United States repealed the Eighteenth Amend - ment in 1933. One of the evils that led to Prohibition in the first place was the system of \"tied houses\" \u2014saloons owned by alcohol producers that marketed their product aggressively. As Prohibition was ending, John D. Rockefel ler com missioned a report published as Toward Liquor Control that advocated total gov ern- ment control of alcohol distribution. \"Only as the profit motive is eliminated is there any hope of controlling the liquor traffic in the interests of a decent society,\" he said. That never happened, of course. Tied houses were banned, but Seagram, Anheuser -Busch, and other companies became gigantic from the manufacture and sale of alcohol ; only eighteen states assumed any direct control over the distribution process . We've grown used to living with the consequences of legal alcohol, even though alcohol is undeniably costly to the nation in lives and treasure. But few would argue for a return to Prohibition, in part because the liquor industry is so lucrative and so p owerful. Binge drinkers \u201420 percent of the drinking population \u2014 consume more than half of the alcohol sold, which means that for all the industry's pious admonitions to \"drink responsibly,\" it depends on people doing the opposite. At the same time, Big Alcoh ol's clout keeps taxation low. Kleiman, of NYU, estimates alcohol taxes to be about a dime a drink ; the societal cost in disease, car wrecks, and violence is about fifteen times that. Neither the binge -dependent economics of alcohol nor the industry's capt ure of the regulatory process is App. 407a something we would want to mimic when legalizing substances such as heroin and crack cocaine. We'll have to do a better job at legalizing drugs than we did at re-legalizing alcohol if we want to hold addiction to a minimum, keep drugs away from children, assure drug purity and consistency of dosage, and limit drugged driving. Last Novem ber, Ohio voters rejected marijuana legalization, most observers believe, pre - cisely because the proposed initiative would have allowed only ten companies, all of which sponsored the initiative, to grow and distribute marijuana in the state. If we can summon the political will, the oppor tu- nity to estab lish a state monopoly on drug distri - bution, just as Rockefeller urged for alcohol in 1933, is now\u2014before the genie is out of the bottle. Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands have successfully made heroin legally avail able to addicts through networks of gov ernment -run dispensaries that are divorced from the profit motive. The advan - tages of a state monopoly over a free market \u2014even a regulated one \u2014are vast. In the 1970s, the eighteen states that estab lished government control over alcohol distribution at the end of Prohibition began to water down their systems by feeding their who lesale or retail alcohol busi nesses, or both, to private industry. Still, in 2013 a team of researchers at the Uni versity of Michigan found that even in \"weak monopoly\" states, consumption of spirits was 12 to 15 percent lower than in states with privat e liquor stores or grocery stores. In states that retained control over retail sales, alcohol -related traffic fatalities were about 7 to 9 percent lower than in states that did not ; crime rates were lower as well. App. 408a Just about everybody who thinks seriously about the end of drug prohibition agrees that we'll want to discourage consumption. This goal could be accomp - lished, at least in part, under a system of regulated, for-profit stores : by setting limits on adver tising and promotion (or banning them altogether), by pre ven- ting marketing to children, by estab lishing min imum distances from schools for retail outlets, by nailing down rules about dosage and purity, and by limiting both the number of stores and their hours of operation. In a for -profit system, how ever, the only way gov ern- ment can influence price \u2014the strongest disincentive to consumption \u2014is by levying a tax, and getting taxes right is no small task. First, on what basis should the tax apply? Fed eral taxes on alcohol are set accord ing to potency, but keeping up with the THC content of every strain of marijuana would be impossible. Weight? The more potent the drug, the less you need to buy, so taxing by weight might end up promoting stronger drugs over weaker. Price? Post -legalization prices are likely to plummet as the \"prohibition premium\" \u2014 which com pensates dealers for the risk of getting caught \u2014disappears, competition sets in, and inno va- tion increases production. To keep prices high enough to discourage use, legislators will hav e to monitor those prices constantly and risk their jobs by pushing for politically unpopular tax increases. \"It's too hard to adjust taxes quickly enough,\" said Pat Oglesby, a North Carolina tax law yer who was chief tax counsel for the Senate Finance Com mittee from 1988 to 1990 and who now researches marijuana taxes. \"Legislatures love lowering taxes. Getting them to raise taxes is like pulling teeth.\" What's more, if App. 409a legislators overdo it and set taxes too high, they'll risk reawakening a black market i n untaxed drugs. A gov ernment monopoly on distribution solves the problem by making the setting of prices a matter of admin istration, not legislation. Gov ernment officials, whether at the state or fed eral level, would have infinite flexibility to adjust the price \u2014daily, if neces - sary\u2014to minimize use without inspiring a black market. The production of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin could remain in private hands, and the producers could supply the gov ernment stores, just as Smirnoff, Coors, and Mondavi pro vide their products to state liquor stores. If the cost of producing a drug drops because of innovation or competition, the gov ernment agency selling that drug to the public would see an increase in r evenues. Likewise, it is much easier for the gov ernment to set the dosage and purity of pro - ducts it sells in its own outlets than to police the dosage and purity of products that are spread throughout a free market. And the gov ernment could decide on its own to what extent it wants to permit advertising, attractive packaging, and promotions. Finally, of course, when the gov ernment holds a monopoly, the public, not private shareholders, enjoys the profit. The states that retain control over alcohol distribution collect 82 to 90 percent more in revenue than states that license private alcohol sales collect in taxes, depending on whether they control both wholesale and retail. That the gov ernment should profit from a product it wants to discourage coul d be seen as hypocritical, but that's the way things stand now with tobacco, alcohol, and gambling. States gen - erally reduce the moral sting of those profits by earmarking them for edu cation or other popular App. 410a causes. In the case of drugs, the profits cou ld go toward treating addicts. The great thing about trying a state monopoly first is that if it doesn't work, it's politically much easier to liberalize to a regulated free market than to go the other way. But as long as fed eral law in the United States maintains an abso lute prohibition on marijuana, cocaine, and heroin \u2014and stringent restrictions on methamphetamine \u2014it's hard to imagine state drug monopolies on the model of state liquor stores. Even if the international bans on Schedule I drugs were to lift, could our legislators muster the will to legalize them, much less to expand gov ernment to distribute them? It's one thing for the chief executive to turn a blind eye to the states' experiments in licensed marijuana commerce ; it's another to grind the gears and shift conservative con gressional sensibilities. This is a pity, since a gov ernment monopoly would be the least expensive and most flexible way to legalize drugs. It would generate the most revenue and\u2014more importan t\u2014it would pro tect public health. Until Con gress reschedules marijuana, heroin, and cocaine, and until we get over the idea that gov ern- ment can do nothing right, we're stuck with second best : state -size experiments that ignore the fed eral ban on mari juana and license private industries. Colorado is the furthest along that path, and its experience is instructive. Colorado has allowed med ical marijuana since 2000 through a system of licensed private state orig inally re quired to be vertically integrated ; dispensaries could sell only what they grew them selves \u2014a replication of the old tied houses. The theory was that it was easier to App. 411a regulate busi nesses from \"seed to sale.\" In Novem ber 2012, 55 percent of vote rs approved Amend ment 64 to the Colorado con stitution, which legalized recre ational marijuana. (The initiative was strategically timed ; having marijuana on the ballot helped draw young and progressive voters to the polls to win the state for President Obama.) After the election, Colorado chose a system of licensed busi nesses over state monopoly ; in 2014, it dropped the require ment that recreational dispensaries be vertically integrated \u2014one busi ness can now grow marijuana for another to sell. As soon as Governor John Hickenlooper formalized the results, five weeks after the vote, Coloradans twenty -one years of age and older could legally possess and use marijuana. Stores and commercial cultivators were not allowed to open, though, until Jan uary 2014, fourteen months after the vote. The delay was meant to allow the state time to expand the Marijuana Enforce ment Division, within the Depa rtment of Revenue, to incorporate retail marijuana into its juris diction, and to allow the division to write rules con cerning signage, advertising, waste disposal, video surveillance, labeling, taxes, and required distances from schools. Already, leg al marijuana in Colorado is following the grim economics of alcohol. Daily smokers make up only 23 percent of the state's pot -smoking population, but they consume 67 percent of the reefer. That may have been true too when marijuana was illegal ; maybe the n umber of daily stoners is neither rising nor falling. We'll never know, because one problem with illegal markets is that you can't track them. But we do know that the legal, for -profit marijuana busi ness in Colorado is already mimicking App. 412a the alcohol busi ness in its dependence on heavy users. From a public -health standpoint, that's troubling. The effect of legalization on crime has been difficult to deter mine. Overall, crime fell in Denver by almost 2 percent in 2014, the first year of full marijuana legalization. And, strangely, surveys of 40,000 teenagers before and after legalization showed that al though fewer now believed marijuana to be harmful \u2014just as the opponents of legalization predicted \u2014fewer were smoking pot . Were they lying? Was it a statistical anomaly? Are pot dealers harder to find now that they're competing with legal stores? Or is it possible that marijuana, once legalized, lost its cachet ? Colorado has run into glitches. The fourteen months between the vote and the opening of the stores wasn't enough time to write regu lations on such variables as pesticide use in cultivation or dosages in edibles. Nor was there time to write a new traini ng curriculum for police, who found them selves not knowing exactly what to do about the large quantities of marijuana they were encountering. People have been stringing ex tension cords together to make their own grow rooms \u2014and burning down their homes. They've pumped so much water into pot cultivation that monstrous blooms of black mold have rendered their houses uninhabitable. And Denver has seen a spate of burglaries and robberies at marijuana greenhouses and stores. The law let local juris dictions decide whether to allow retail pot stores. Only thirty -five counties did so at first, which is partly why the state received only $12 million in new marijuana taxes in the first six months of legal pot sales \u2014about a third of what regulators had anticipated. (\"That's changing,\" said Lewis Koski, the forty -four-year-old App. 413a who is the deputy senior direc tor of Colorado's Enforce ment Division, in 2014. \"Just about every week we have new juris dictions allowing it.\") It may also be that the state set the tax on r etail marijuana too high \u201410 percent on top of the usual sales tax. Some smokers are apparently continuing to buy on the black market, which is often cheaper. (It may be that almost everybody who wanted to buy legal pot already had a med ical-marijuana I.D . card ; 111,000 Coloradans \u2014more than 2 percent of the population \u2014 hold them, and med ical pot carries only the regular sales tax.) Still, in 2015, Colorado collected about $135 million in marijuana taxes and fees, almost double what it took in the year before. Cracking down on unlicensed growing operations and training cops has been relatively easy. What's going to be tougher is keeping big busi ness from overwhelming the exer cise and rigging the game. Even with only four states and the Dis trict of Col umbia having legalized, and only twenty -three states allowing the med ical use of marijuana, legit imate production is already a $5.4 billion industry. Forbes has published a list of the \"8 Hottest Publicly Traded Marijuana Companies.\" Cannabis stocks in clude biotech com - panies, makers of specialized vending machines, and manufacturers of vaporizers that allow inhalation without tar or burning the product. The combined value of marijuana stocks rose by 50 percent in 2013 and by 150 percent in the first th ree weeks of 2014, before settling down to a still -impressive 38 percent gain for the year. In Sep tember 2014, MJardin, a maker of turnkey growing operations, announced that it was considering an initial public offering. Even the Wall Street Journal analyzes marijuana as a serious App. 414a investment oppor tunity. These enormous bets are being placed at a time when recreational marijuana is still illegal in forty -six states and under fed eral law. The citizens of the U.S. juris dictions that legalized marijuana may have set in motion more machinery than most of them had imagined. \"Without marijuana prohibition, the gov ernment can't sustain the drug war,\" Ira Glasser, who ran the Amer ican Civil Liberties Union from 1978 to 2001, told me. \"Without marijuana, the use of drugs is negligible, and you can't justify the law-enforce ment and prison spending on the other drugs. Their use is vanishingly small. I always thought that if you could cut the marijuana head off the beast, the dru g war couldn't be sustained.\" Even in my hometown of Boulder, which may be the most pot -friendly city in the United States, \"it's not marijuana gone wild,\" as Jane Brautigam, the city manager, told officials from Colorado and Washington during a public con ference call in Sep tember 2014. People were, for the most part, \"feeling okay about it,\" she said. Marijuana charges in Colorado were down 80 percent : only 2,000 or so Coloradans were charged for marijuana offenses in 2014, as opposed to nearly 10,000 in 2011. Brautigam has had to shut down a few marijuana busi nesses for vio lations, but no more than in other industries. \"There was an implication that there would be people smoking all over the place,\" she said. \"That hasn't happened.\" When I checked in with her office in Jan uary, things were still going well, Patrick von Keyserling, the city commu nications direc tor, told me, in large part because \"it's a very well-regulated industry.\" To the extent that we in Colorado think about legal marijuana, n ow that the initial excitement has App. 415a worn off, we have a smug sense that we have taken the lead in doing something smart. We are as divided as any place over immigrants, guns, and climate change, but our police don't waste their time chasing down pot smokers anymore. Adults don't have to worry, as they used to, about neighbors smelling reefer smoke wafting from their patios. Even if marijuana tax revenues \u2014which are slated to help public schools \u2014 aren't what we'd hoped, our state is making money from something that used to cost it money. Marijuana is no big deal. We look at other states that treat it as a public menace and wonder what in the world they're thinking. Nobody I spoke with in the United States or elsewhere envisioned stores selling heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine as freely as Colorado stores sell marijuana or as state liquor stores sell vodka. The way most researchers imagine hard -drug distri bution, short of a state monopoly, involves some kind of supervision. A network of counselors \u2014not neces sarily physicians \u2014would monitor how a drug fits into a person's life. When Kleiman, at NYU, allows himself to imagine legal cocaine, he pictures users setting their own dose. \"You can decide whether you want to raise your quota \u2014a bureaucratic pro cess\u2014or see someone about your cocaine problem. This is to give your long -term self a fighting chance against your short -term self.\" Eric Sterling, the executive direc tor of the anti - prohibition Criminal Justice Policy Foun dation, envisions a similar sy stem. \"Someone might say, 'I want cocaine because it stimulates me in my creative work,' or, 'I want cocaine to improve my orgasms.' The response might be, 'Why don't you have enough App. 416a energy? Do you exer cise?' Or, 'What might be interfering with the curren t quality of your sex life?' \"Those who want to try LSD or other psychedelics, Sterling suggests, might go to licensed \"trip leaders,\" analogous to wilderness guides \u2014people trained, indemnified, and insured to take the uninitiated into potentially dangerou s territory. Of course, it's easy to imagine people who enjoy cocaine, heroin, or psychedelics saying \"to hell with all that\" and continuing to buy on the black market. But, as Sterling points out, doing so is risky. If someone as rich and well -connected as Philip Seym our Hoffman can die from a heroin shot, nobody is safe. Also, as Sterling notes, \"It's a hassle to be an addict. Find a dealer, score, find a place to get off . . . \" If a law ful, regulated system is fine -tuned \u2014so that drugs are cheap and trustworthy, the process is not too burdensome, and the taxes on them are not too high \u2014 users will likely come to prefer it to the black market. Competition, not violence, will destroy the criminal gangs that control illegal drug distribution. \"Ulti - mately this is all abou t building the proper cultural context for using drugs,\" Sterling says, a context in which \"the exaggerations and the falsehoods get extinguished.\" In 2009, Britain's Transform Drug Policy Foun - dation put out a 232 -page report called \"After the War on Dru gs: Blueprint for Regu lation.\" The authors suggested issuing licenses for buying and using drugs, with sanctions for those who screw up \u2014much like gun licenses in some U.S. states, or driver's licenses. Users would have their purchases tracked by computer, so rising use would, in theory, be noticed, making inter -App. 417a vention possible. Legal vendors would bear ponsibility for \"socially destruc tive incidents\" \u2014the way bartenders can be held res ponsible for serving an obvious drunk who later has an accident behind the wheel. For pricing, the report suggests prices high enough to \"discourage misuse, and suf ficiently low to ensure that under -cutting . . . is not profitable for illicit drug suppliers.\" And al though the British group argued for a gen erally more laissez -faire market than European and Canadian government -run heroin - distribution systems, it embraced a complete ban on any kind of advertising and marketing, and argued instead for plain, pharma ceuticalstyle packaging. I voted for marijuana legalization even though I hadn't smoked pot in years and wasn't much interested in doing so. Legalization seemed a sensible political and economic measure, and a way to distinguish Colorado as a progressive beacon of the West. But one night in July, I was headed for the Cruiser Ride, Boulder's goofy, costumed weekly bicycle parade, an d I thought it might be fun to try it stoned. It was a lightbulb -over-the-head moment. A year ago, I wouldn't have known where to find a joint. Now, I simply pedaled to the Green Room, a marijuana retail store a mile from my house. Al though I wear every o ne of my fifty-nine years on my face, I was carded \u2014in a reception room decorated with portraits of Jerry Garcia and Jimi Hendrix. A bud tender escorted me into the store, where I stood at a counter, separated from the customer next to me by a discreet, ban k- teller -like divider. I picked up a card titled EDIBLES EDU CATION : START LOW , GO SLOW and read that if I bought any of the pot -laced artisanal goodies, I should not consume them with alcohol ; I should keep App. 418a them out of the reach of children ; I should sta rt with a single small serving and wait two hours before taking more. \"Everybody's metabolism is different,\" it said. For a new consumer, no more than one to five milligrams of cannabis was re commended ; the potency of the buttery candies and cookies was listed on the labels. This was a far cry from the fibrous, foul -tasting pot brownies I used to eat before late -night college screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey. A young bud tender \u2014tattooed and achingly pro- fessional\u2014presided over a copious a rray of marijuana blossoms in large glass apothecary jars. I confess I got a little lost as he discoursed, with Talmudic subtlety, on the differences between Grape Ape, Stardawg, and Bubba Kush. The joint that I bought for $10 \u2014fat, expertly rolled, and wit h a little paper filter \u2014came in a green plastic tube with a police -badge -shaped sticker reading DEPART MENT OF REVENUE , MARIJUANA . For someone who started buying pot in alleys when Gerald Ford was president, this felt like Elysium. I wasn't allowed to ligh t up in the store or out side on the street ; I had to go home to smoke legally. As instructed, I started low and went slow, taking only one hit. Twenty minutes later, I was stoned in that good way I remembered : I felt perceptive and amused, with none of the sluggishness or paranoia common to the old fifteen -dollar ounces. That single joint I bought is so strong that even though I've taken hits from it half a dozen times since my Cruiser Ride, I still have about a third left, a treat to keep around for the right occasion. So under legalization I have become a pot smoker again. But I don't drive stoned or need treat ment, so App. 419a who cares? I drink a beer or a dram of Laphroaig most days too, and I still hit my deadline for this article. If it is now time to start thinking creatively about legalization, we'd be wise to remember that, like care - fully laid military plans, detailed drug -liber alization strategies probably won't survive their first contact with reality. \"Peo ple are thinking about the utopian endgame, but the transition will be unpre dictable,\" says Sterling, of the Criminal Justice Policy Foun da- tion. \"What ever system of regu lation gets set up, there will be people who exploit the edges. But that's true f or speeding, for alcohol, for guns.\" Without a state -run monopoly, there will be more than one type of legal, regulated drug market, he says, and the markets won't solve every conceivable problem. \"Nobody thinks our alcohol system is a complete fail ure because there are after -hours sales, or because people occasionally buy alcohol for minors.\" Legalizing, and then regulating, drug markets will likely be messy, at least in the short term. Still, in a technocratic, capitalist , and fun damentally free society like the United States, education, counseling, treat ment, distribution, regu - lation, pricing, and taxation all seem to better fit our national skill set than the suppression of immense black markets and the violence and corruption that come wi th it.

I am a former member of the Richard Nixon Presidential Administration. I submit this Affidavit in connection with plaintiffs' Order to Show Cause for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. As explained below, I have personal knowledge of the rationales and motivations underlying enactment, administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") by the Nixon Administration. My Background 2. I am, and for more than 40 years have been, a political consultant and operative, wo rking predomi - nantly with Republican candidates and officials. I began my political career at age 12, working for Barry Goldwater's 1964 Presidential Campaign. Thereafter, while attending George Washington University, I accepted a position with the Committ ee to Re -Elect President Nixon (\"CRP\"). My work for CRP provided me with close access to Nixon Adminis tration officials and associates, with whom I interacted regularly. 3. After Richard Nixon was re -elected as President in 1972, 1 was offered and took a position with his Administration's Office of Economic Opportunity, where I continued to work closely with Nixon Administration officials and associates in the creation and admin - istration of policy. 4. In addition to my te nure with the Nixon Administration, I also worked with and/or for other public officials, candidates and campaigns over the years, including, among others : President Ronald Reagan ; Senator and Republican Presidential Candi - date Robert Dole ; Governor Thomas Keane (New Jersey) ; Congressman Jack Kemp (New York) ; Senator App. 422a Arlen Spector (Pennsylvania) ; and President Donald J. Trump. 5. I have authored five books : The Man Who Killed Kennedy : The Case Against LBJ (Skyhorse Publishing 2013) ; Nixon Secrets : The Rise, Fall and Untold Truth About the President, Watergate, and the Pardon (Skyhorse Publishing 2014) ; The Clinton's War on Women (Skyhorse Publishing 2015) ; Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family (Skyhorse Publishing 2016) ; The Making of the President 2016 : How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution (Skyhorse Publishing 2017). I also regularly appear as a guest contributor on network and cable news and politically -focused television shows, including, among others, CNN, FoxNews, AB CNews, NB CNews, Meet the P ress, Real Time with Bill Maher, and C -Span. 6. In short, I have devoted most of my professional life to politics and public policy, focusing my efforts in support of candidates, causes and policies affiliated with the Republican Party. The Controlled Subs tances Act 7. Working with the Nixon Administration afforded me constant contact with Administration officials, both inside and outside the White House. One of the officials with whom I was in regular contact was Myles Ambrose, who, at the time, was involv ed in President Nixon's \"War on Drugs\" and eventually became the first \"Drug Czar\" (Exhibit 23, N.Y. Times Article). I remember that, in the winter of 1971,1 met Mr. Ambrose at \"The Exchange,\" then a popular hangout for politicos in Washington, DC. Over dr inks, Mr. Ambrose and I began to discuss the President's agenda. Not surprisingly, he spoke most favorably of App. 423a the President's plan to \"win\" the War on Drugs. In particular, Mr. Ambrose said to me : \"We gotta do this drug stuff. We gotta get rid of the 'niggers.'\" He proceeded to explain that those associated with the President associated African Americans and hippies protesting the Vietnam War with marijuana, which the President and Mr. Ambrose believed was the drug of choice for these two groups. I remember this conversation well, because it shocked and offended me. 8. I came to learn, and, as is known to history, those associated with the President felt that war protestors and those with whom they associated were a threat to the Nation in its fight against communism. He also had mixed emotions toward African Americans, whom he may have associated with the anti -war left. No legislation could be focused directly at these two groups, as the Administration recognized that such would draw objections based upon, a mong other things, constitutional grounds. The alternative strategy developed by the Administration was to use the War on Drugs \u2014and, in particular, the efforts to criminalize and prosecute possession and use of cannabis \u2014to marginalize war protestors and Af rican Americans and \"get them off the streets.\" To convert these viewpoints into policy, the President, members of his Administration, and those whom he entrusted to liaise with Congress dedicated themselves to enacting and administering a legislative agen da directed toward prosecuting, in particular, war protestors and African Americans for use of cannabis. 9. The Administration's efforts were successful in enacting the CSA in 1970. Thereafter, the President named Mr. Ambrose to lead the White House Office of App. 424a Drug -Abuse Law Enforcement \u2014a precursor to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which then led the Admin - istration's War on Drugs. 1 10. Again, all of these efforts, as they pertained to criminalizing cannabis, were directed toward suppressing the rights of African Americans and protestors of the Vietnam War, whom the President believed were threatening to undermine America's sense of collective purpose in the Cold War and the battle ag ainst communism. My recollection of these events and conversations is consistent with those of others from the Nixon Administration. For example, John Ehrlichman, who served as the Administration's Domestic Policy Chief and was one of the President's close st political advisors, confirmed that the enactment and enforcement of laws criminalizing cannabis were directed toward political suppression and racial discrimination. In this regard, Mr. Ehrlichman said : You want to know what this was really all about? T he Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies : the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to ass ociate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those commu - nities . We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and 1 Ironically, Mr. Ambrose, who was slated to be come the first director of the DEA, resigned from the Administration before accepting the post. App. 425a vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. N.Y. Daily News, A. Edelman, Nixon Aide : \"War on Drugs\" was tool to target \"black people\" (March 23, 2016) (Exh. 4) ; see also Harper's Magazine, D. Baum, Legalize it All : How to Win the War on Drugs (April 2016) (Exh. 5) (\"Nixon's invention of the war on drugs as a political tool was cynical . . . \"). 11. If incarceration of the antiwar left and African Americans constitutes the measure of the War on Drugs' success, the A dministration's efforts must be characterized as \"successful.\" According to the New York Daily News, \"by 1973, about 300,000 people were arrested under the law \u2014the majority of whom were African American\" (Exh. 4). 12. The Administration's anti -carmabis po licies thus were manifested in two distinct, but related, efforts \u2014to usher the CSA through Congress and then to use the law as a tool to incarcerate, harass and undermine those whom the President considered hostile to American interests. 13. While there a lso may well have been those who genuinely believed that marijuana was a danger ous drug on par with heroin, the individuals responsible for making and administering America's drug policy were, in my experience, not among them. The driving force behind the CSA and its admin is- tration was to suppress and discriminate. It represents a regrettable and unfortunate period in American history which, I trust, contemporary society will, at some point, endeavor to correct \u2014perhaps now. App. 426a For these reasons, I join the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. /s/ Roger Stone Sworn before me this 16th day of June , 2017. /s/ Michael S.
