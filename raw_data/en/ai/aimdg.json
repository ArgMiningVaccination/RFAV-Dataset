Variables in the questionnaire and data files in the form varname_x, where x=1, 2, 3, etc., have the f orm varname.0x where x=1,2,3, etc. in the codebook. Similarly, vari ables in the form varname_xmo and varname_xnu in the data files have the form varnamemo.0x and varnamenu.0x, respectively, in the codebook.
