This Patent Landscape Report provides observations on the field of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, based on a comprehensive review of patenting activity and building on insights from the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report published in March 2022. Pandemic-related filing activity has been extraordinarily active The patent search undertaken for this report looked at related patent filings from January 2020 through September 2022. It found 7,758 patent filings on technologies related to COVID-19 in general, including 1,298 patent filings related to vaccine development and 4,787 to therapeutics. Patenting activity related to COVID-19 outpaced that of other recent viruses and illnesses, such as influenza and SARS, both in volume and speed of filing. Patenting filing activity has been concentrated at four patent offices Because COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics have a global market, it should come as no surprise that related applications were filed and published by patent offices all over the world. Specifically, vaccine patents were published across 30 patent offices and therapeutic patents across 44 patent offices. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), administering the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system, received the most COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic patent applications, followed by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO), all receiving a significant number of applications of either type. WIPO's current top ranking is a likely indication that patent applicants are leveraging the WIPO- administered PCT system in order to protect inventions across multiple jurisdictions. Both business and the research community have contributed significantly to the patent landscape Patent applicants are distributed almost equally between companies (52 percent of the vaccines and 49 percent of the therapeutics dataset) and universities and research organizations (42 percent of the vaccines and 38 percent of the therapeutics dataset), but with companies accounting for a larger proportion of the two datasets. China is the leading origin of patent filings related to vaccines and therapeutics A patent applicant's location can provide information about the profile and origin of the key players in terms of patenting activity. The top five patent applicant locations in the field of vaccines are China, the United States of America (US), Germany, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation. In the field of therapeutics, China, the United States, the Republic of Korea, India and Germany are the top applicant locations.Key findingsKey findings 7 The relative frequency of discussions around mRNA and other types of vaccines for COVID-19 is at variance with patenting activity in the dataset Although global discussion around vaccines was primarily focused on mRNA vaccines, a comparison of doses administered worldwide of the different categories of vaccine tells another story. Two apparent discrepancies are that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines accounted for the majority of vaccinations in the western world, but patents related to this type of vaccine accounted for just 11 percent of the dataset; but conversely, protein subunit vaccines accounted for less than 1 percent of vaccine doses administered in that same region, but represented the largest portion (47 percent) of the vaccine patent dataset. China has almost exclusively administered inactivated vaccines, whereas Africa has primarily administered viral vector vaccines. Small molecule and biologic drugs are the two main types of therapeutics Within the dataset, therapeutics for COVID-19 mostly fall into three main types: small molecules that include synthetic compounds but may also be natural products extracted and purified from plants; biologic drugs that include antibodies, non-antibody peptides/proteins, cell-based therapies and nucleic acid-based therapies; and traditional medicine. The largest proportion of COVID-19 therapeutics patent filings relates to small molecules and biologics (50 percent and 43 percent of the therapeutics patent dataset, respectively). However, traditional medicine also has a role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Within the therapeutics dataset, 10 percent of filings disclosed the use of traditional medicine in treating COVID-19. Antibodies accounted for one-third of biologics, and in their newly developed virus-neutralizing form introduce a new class of antiviral The fastest growing class of biologics, antibodies made up about one-third (34 percent) of the biologics disclosed in patent documents. COVID-19 therapeutic antibodies include newly developed neutralizing antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, as well as previously developed antibodies that modulate the host's immune/inflammatory response to the virus. Virus-neutralizing antibodies represent a new class of antivirals. When given in combination, they are capable of binding to various regions of a crucial segment in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and in so doing effectively block the viral S protein from interacting with its receptor on human cells. Other antibodies that target human host factors may be used to reduce inflammation and counter adverse effects from the cytokine storms seen in some severe cases of COVID-19. The patent dataset discloses some innovative treatment approaches The dataset includes information on other potential methods for COVID-19 treatment. Novel approaches include the use of CRISPR-Cas technology to target viral genes so as to disrupt the virus's ability to infect host cells; nucleic acid-based drugs (e.g., interfering RNA, short microRNA, antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers) designed to attack SARS-CoV-2 at distinct stages of its lifecycle and/or to modulate host dependency factors; and, lastly, novel delivery vehicles, such as engineered exosomes (i.e., the membrane-bound extracellular vesicles of human cells). The advent of biotechnology related to exosomes enriched with the desired molecules, including drugs, has enabled the commercial production of novel delivery vehicles. Drug or cargo-loaded exosomes containing immune-modulating substances in combination with antiviral substances can provide rapid and targeted delivery for disease treatment. The potential application of these innovative strategies in the treatment of COVID-19 in clinical settings is yet to be determined.Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics8 Collaborations comprised pharmaceutical companies, biotech startups and universities Cooperation between big pharmaceutical companies and relatively small biotech companies, and between universities and both these types of commercial organizations was evident across different regions of the world. For example, development of the oral antiviral therapeutic molnupiravir involved Emory University, Merck, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Merck and the Medicines Patent Pool also had a licensing agreement to provide molnupiravir as a COVID-19 treatment to low- and middle-income countries. Developers of vaccines and therapeutics also collaborated with different manufacturers at the manufacturing stage (Global Healthcare Innovation Alliance Accelerator. (n.d.-a). Patents related to booster vaccines are only a small part of the vaccine patent dataset About 5 percent of vaccine patents in the dataset emphasized booster use. This is at variance with extensive media discussion, government recommendations and policy debates around the availability and use of boosters. Data on booster usage by country and income level show that high-income economies have higher levels of booster vaccination, whereas low-income regions have very low booster usage and middle-income countries range between the two. Roughly a tenth of COVID-19 therapeutics patents related to traditional medicine From January 2020 through September 2022, 523 patent applications related to traditional medicine were published. Most were filed by applicants located in Asia. Over 60 percent were filed at the China National International Property Administration (CNIPA). The intellectual property offices of India and Republic of Korea were the next biggest recipients of traditional medicine patents. Patents related to long COVID made up less than 2 percent of the dataset Therapeutics for the treatment of long COVID - defined by the World Health Organization as the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms lasting for at least two months without another explanation - were disclosed in 22 patents (WHO, 2022b). The majority (13) disclosed small molecule therapeutics to treat long COVID. The remainder comprised biologics, traditional medicine and other types of therapeutics for long COVID treatment. Corporate applicants filed the most patents related to pharmaceutical formulations for COVID-19 therapeutics Over 90 percent of patent applications relating specifically to pharmaceutical formulations were submitted by corporate applicants, either alone or in combination with a university or research organization or an independent inventor. Within this subset of patents, the majority relate to formulations of small molecule therapeutics (64 percent), followed by biologics (34 percent). Nearly one-quarter of patent applications were the result of collaboration between multiple applicants Patent applications with more than one assignee made up 24 percent of the dataset. In the vaccine dataset, collaboration was between all applicant types, including companies, universities and research organizations. In the therapeutics dataset, the majority of collaborations were between universities and research organizations. 9 In late 2019, a mysterious pneumonia-like illness emerged in China that caught the attention of the world's health experts and scientists. The illness quickly spread around the globe. Research into its cause revealed it to be the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global public health emergency and named the illness COVID-19, in February 2020 (WHO, 2020). Soon afterwards, in March 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of November 28, 2022, there had been more than 637 million cases confirmed worldwide, resulting in over 6.6 million deaths (WHO, n.d.-g), making it one of the deadliest pandemics in modern history, second only to the 1918 flu pandemic (Adam, 2022). Its severity and the complexity in battling COVID-19 pandemic has been compounded by the ongoing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, with sublineages of the Omicron variant currently of most concern (WHO, n.d.-f). In response to the pandemic, scientists around the world have made great strides in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This in turn has led to the development of preventive vaccines and therapeutic agents. By leveraging decades of vaccine technology research and development (R&D), scientists have been able to quickly first develop and then deploy a variety of COVID-19 vaccines. As of December, 2022, more than 13.04 billion vaccine doses had been administered globally (WHO, n.d.-c). In parallel, existing drugs have been repurposed and new therapeutics developed to combat the disease. This report is a follow-up to WIPO's first COVID-19-related Vaccines and Therapeutics Patent Landscape Report published in early 2022 (WIPO, 2022). It presents an updated overview of global patenting activity related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics from January 2020 through September 2022, based on information publicly available as of September 30, 2022. Because of the lag in time between patent filing and publication of the related application (on average 18 months), this report does not give a complete picture but rather a perspective on publicly available COVID-19-related patent information up until September 2022. Since the pandemic began, various patent analytics and scientific publications have sought to shed light on patent activities and technologies related to COVID-19. A list of these publications can be found in the Further reading section. Introduction10 The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 - SARS-CoV-2 - was unknown to the scientific community until discovered in late 2019. Since then, its structure and mechanism of action have been extensively studied. The full genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first published on January 10, 2020, by Yong-Zhen Zhang at Fudan University, China (Zhang, 2020). Upon the sequence's release, it became possible to define the structure of the virus (shown in Figure 1). Since then, focus has been on identifying, understanding and tracking variants in order to predict whether existing vaccines and therapeutics are likely to prove effective in preventing and treating the associated disease. Figure 1. The genomic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed the presence of the spike (S) glycoprotein that is key in causing infection. 11Background - biology of COVID-19 Figure 1. The glycoprotein nucleocapsid (N) protein genomic RNA Source: WIPO based on Gordon et al ., 2020. COVID-19 was initially described as a respiratory disease caused by viral infection of the lungs and characterized by lung damage, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Observations of the symptoms of COVID-19 survivors (Lopez-Leon et al. , 2021) indicate long-term secondary effects in other systems of the body, including the cardiovascular, neuromuscular and endocrine systems. Acute infection may also include symptoms of thrombosis, stroke, hypertension, olfactory and digestive disorders, or an excessive inflammatory response due to cytokine storm. These varied symptoms have led some researchers to characterize COVID-19 as a vascular disorder (Siddiqi et al., 2021). Many of the therapeutics in our patent dataset target one or more of these symptoms as a strategy for treatment. Substantial efforts have been made to develop vaccines and effective and safe therapeutics for COVID-19. Multiple vaccine platforms have been explored. These platforms include traditional , well-established types of vaccines, such as whole-virus vaccines (live attenuated and inactivated), virus-like particles and protein-subunit vaccines, and novel vaccines with little pre-existing data on safety and efficacy in humans, such as nucleic acid (DNA- and RNA-based) vaccines, viral-vector- based vaccines and antigen-presenting cells. Additionally, diverse small-molecule drugs and biologics, e.g., peptides and antibodies, are being developed to treat COVID-19. Source: WIPO, based on Gordon et al. , 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus's mechanism of action has been discussed in detail in the previous WIPO Patent Landscape Report on COVID-19 (WIPO, 2022). In short, the virus's outer lipid envelope is covered with spike glycoprotein (S protein). It is this S protein that interacts with human cells to cause infection. In the initial stage of infection, the coronavirus S protein binds to specific host cellular entry receptors. This opens the door for the virus to enter a cell. Once inside, the virus repurposes the host cell's system in order to replicate and invade further host cells. Vaccines and therapeutics are typically designed to disrupt this and associated subprocesses.Background - biology of COVID-19Background - biology of COVID-19 11 As viruses spread within a population, their genetic material mutates. Most mutations have little or no impact on the properties of a virus (Grubaugh et al. , 2020). Those mutations that do are typically called variants. Such variants can increase transmissibility or disease severity and decrease diagnostic effectiveness, as well as vaccine or therapeutic efficacy; all challenges impacting public health and the social measures needed to combat the virus (WHO, n.d.-f). Several variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus now exist, including the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. Every one of these variants has subvariants or sublineages, commonly recognized by their Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) identifier. Table 1 provides a high-level summary of SARS-CoV-2 variants. More information about variants can be obtained from the WHO's SARS-CoV-2 variant tracking website (WHO, n.d.-f). Table 1. Summary of SARS-CoV-2 variants Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged since the pandemic began in early 2020. Omicron is the most recently sequenced variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Unlike its predecessors, no one country of origin has been identified for this variant. WHO label Pango lineage Date of 1st sequence documentation Country of origin Alpha B.1.1.7 September 2020 UK Beta B.1.351 May 2020 South Africa Gamma P.1 November 2020 Brazil Delta B.1.617.2 October 2020 India Omicron B.1.1.529 November 2021 Multiple countries Source: WIPO, based on data obtained from the World Health Organization, December 2022. Omicron variant B.1.1.529 and its sublineages are currently of most concern. First classified as a variant under monitoring by the WHO on November 24, 2021, the Omicron variant was upgraded only two days later to a variant of concern on November 26, 2021 (WHO, 2021a). This variant has many sublineages, each of which has a variety of mutations that generally increase the risk of infection and reinfection through greater transmissibility and virulence (Fan et al. , 2022). The WHO has recommended that public health authorities monitor sublineages as distinct lineages, so as to track the virus's evolution and make informed public health decisions. A further concern is the ability of the Omicron variant and sublineages to evade not only natural but also vaccine-mediated immune responses. The only relief offered by this variant is its reduced pathogenicity, meaning less severe disease, fewer hospitalizations and not so many deaths (Fan et al. , 2022). Substantial efforts have been made to develop safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics with which to combat COVID-19 and the many SARS-CoV-2 virus variants. Multiple vaccine platforms have been studied, including conventional (e.g., protein subunit and live attenuated and inactivated virus) and novel platforms (e.g., DNA and RNA-based). With the rise of SARS- CoV-2 variants, bivalent and multivalent vaccines to combat the virus more effectively are also being investigated. Additionally, the repurposing of many existing therapeutics to treat COVID-19 (e.g., remdesivir and fluvoxamine) has been considered and new therapeutics developed, including a diverse set of small molecule drugs and biologics.12 Patent filings during 2020-2022 Since 2020, 8,050 patent applications related to COVID-19 have been published across 49 patent offices, including on diagnostics, treatments, vaccines and otherwise relating either to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19 disease. Among these, 1,298 patent applications related to COVID-19 vaccine development were first filed at 30 patent offices and 4,787 related to COVID-19 therapeutics at 44 offices (Table 2). These numbers have increased since WIPO published its first COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report leveraging data collected from January 2020 to September 2021. Also, since then, a greater number of offices are represented in both vaccine and therapeutic filings. In addition to the 8,050 patent applications published since the beginning of 2020, about 597,057 scientific literature articles, including in journals, books and meeting proceedings, had been published by the end of September 2022, based on CAS Content Collection (CAS, n.d.-a; CAS, n.d.-b). Patent filings related to therapeutics continue to greatly outnumber those on vaccines, by a ratio of approximately 4:1. Advanced biomedical engineering research techniques and innovative tools have allowed scientists to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway, as well as the key enzymes and proteins required for viral replication. Numerous patent offices have focused on technological innovation in the development of monoclonal antibodies, various drug delivery systems and nano-antibodies capable of binding to and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Nanobodies present a more logistically advantageous alternative to intravenously delivered antibodies, since they can be nebulized and delivered directly into a COVID-19 patient's lungs through an inhaler (Sasisekharan, 2021). Most vaccine inventions have focused on polypeptides, such as SARS-CoV-2 antigens, that stimulate an efficient immune response, especially B cell production of neutralizing antibodies. Table 2. Patent applications related to COVID-19 in general, COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-19 therapeutics, first published and filed January 2020 through September 2022 Over three-quarters of the overall COVID-19 patent dataset is related to COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics. Patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics were almost four times higher than for COVID-19 vaccines and patent protection sought at most patent offices.

Patent first-filings are shown in gray bars and patent publications are shown in orange bars. The dataset reflects the average 18-month lag between patent filing and patent publication. Over the 30-month period encompassed by the dataset, more first-filings are observed early in the period, followed by a similar pattern for publications later in the period. Figure 2 shows that a majority of filings occurred in 2020 and early 2021. This data trend describes a period when intense innovation drove early identification and the development of effective means of combating SARS-CoV-2. Figure 2. Patent applications related to COVID-19, first filed and published January 2020 through September 2022, by patent filing and publication month COVID-19-related patent application filing peaked in April 2020, followed by a corresponding peak in COVID-19-related publications 711 9 955 14 724 57 545 134 497 109 416 159 434 142 377 150 379 158 474 165 274 124 300 113 281 145 83 152 71 106 86 140 64 155 74 277 72 532 57 803 74 624 96 578 49 367 47 367 64 466 77 319 48 399 48 389 14 265 3 317 310Filings Publications Source: WIPO, based on patent data from the CAS Content Collection, September 2022. As Figure 3 shows, the patent filing trend for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics is similar to the overall COVID-19 patent filing trend, with patent filings peaking in April 2020, according to information publicly available as of the end of September 2022 (date of data collection). Throughout the period, therapeutic filings were consistently higher than vaccine filings. Because data collection for some of the period measured coincides with the average 18-month interval between a patent application and its publication, caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about monthly trends, especially later on in the measured period.Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics14 Figure 3.

Corporate applicants account for the largest percentage of filings in both categories (52 percent of vaccine filings and 49 percent of therapeutics). Universities and public research organizations make a similar contribution to both categories (42 percent of the vaccine dataset and 38 percent of the therapeutics), while independent inventors were more active in the field of therapeutics (12 percent) than in vaccines (6 percent). Table 3. Contribution to COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic datasets, by patent applicant profile Patenting activity related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics is nearly equally distributed between companies and universities and research organizations, with companies making a slightly greater contribution.

Patent office COVID-19 strategies and actions Patent offices around the world have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of ways and made significant efforts to provide continuous intellectual property processing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These include by teleworking, interacting with applicants virtually, permitting electronic signatures and supporting applicants through time limit options and fee relief (WIPO, n.d.). Some patent offices developed and implemented programs designed to expedite the review process for COVID-19-related patents meeting certain criteria (WIPO, n.d.). As shown in Figure 5, eight countries created specific programs for expediting COVID-19-related patent applications (WIPO, n.d.). Such programs were identified by leveraging a combination of World Trade Organization and WIPO data. While there may have been additional programs around the world, these eight offices are highlighted in this report because of their presence in these two sources.Overview of patenting activity related to COVID-19 17 Figure 5.

Patent Offices with Expedited COVID -19 Application Examination Note: Any additional programs not present in the two data sources are not represented in this figure. Source: Based on data from the World Trade Organization and WIPO, December 2022. There were several commonalities between patent offices running programs to expedite COVID-19-related patent application examination. Canada, France and the United States required the subject of a patent application to have either entered, be already in, or have completed the submission process for marketing authorization for use in that country with the competent authority (CIPO, 2020; Institut National de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle, 2021; USPTO, n.d.). In the Republic of Korea, to qualify for the expedited program, patent applications could be treatments either supported by national R&D projects or from companies preparing for their production, clinical trial and approval (KIPO, 2020b). In early 2020, the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) developed a website designed to highlight patent technology information and provide a patent analysis and trend report and a research information portal, with the aim of stimulating research and patents to promote innovation. Much of the information available from the portal was posted in early 2020. The patent analysis and trend reports include historical information relating to vaccine technologies, therapeutics and coronaviruses, along with personal protective equipment, disease transmission prevention and diagnostics (KIPO, 2020a). China's patent application acceleration program starting after the issuance of a policies/practices order by three government agencies in February 2020 was one of the earliest to commence (SAMR, 2020). Prioritization and accelerated procedures for COVID-19-related patent applications could be requested by applicants. In a July 2022 press conference, a CNIPA official stated that 2,572 COVID-19-related patent applications had been prioritized by the end of June 2022 (Information Office, Government of China, 2022).Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics18 Israel's program for expediting patent applications related to COVID-19 commenced in April 2020 and was enabled by the Patent Commissioner categorizing them as 'green technology'. Patent applications that qualified for the program focused on diagnostics, treatment, prevention and personal protective equipment related to SARS-CoV-2 (Pearl and Heiliczer, 2020). Brazil's National Institute of Industrial Property's expedited review program included a provision allowing the Ministry of Health to request the fast-tracking of specific patents (Pess\u00f4a et al. , 2022). According to research undertaken by Pess\u00f5a et al. , the Brazilian Ministry of Health requested the expedited review of 63 patents. Patent applicants themselves requested expedited review of 51 patents, making a total of 114 patents processed in this manner. The National Institute of Industrial Property also created and published an information portal for COVID-19-related patents, featuring technologies and specific patent applications (Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial, 2020). In April 2020, the Russian Federation's Rospatent established a system to expedite COVID-19- related patent applications (FIPS, n.d.-a). In order to be considered, a patent application must be an antiviral drug or relate to diagnostic testing for viral disease, medical products, personal protective equipment or disinfecting materials. This system aims to issue the results of a first examination within two months. Additionally, Rospatent developed an information portal and launched it in May 2020. The portal features patent content fulfilling the same criteria that applies to the COVID-19 expedited examination program (FIPS, n.d.-b). Throughout this period, the Japan Patent Office (JPO) has maintained an overarching focus on increasing the speed of review for all patent applications (JPO, n.d.). COVID-19 patent applications were not expedited through any special programs. Additionally, the JPO and the EPO issued a joint statement regarding their efforts on expediting examination through the Patent Prosecution Highway program (Japan Patent Office and European Patent Office, 2020). Figure 6 highlights those countries whose patent offices offered time limit options to patent applicants at some point during the COVID-19 pandemic (WIPO, n.d.). Time limit provisions were not confined to COVID-19-related patent applications (WIPO, n.d.). Patent offices recognized the difficulties faced by many applicants, especially during periods when COVID-related restrictions were in operation. Those countries with more generalized time limit options are indicated in orange (Extended), those with case-by-case or request-basis time limit options indicated in gray (Potential for extension) and those with suspended or discontinued options indicated in blue (Suspended). Like Figure 5, this dataset has been collected from a combination of World Trade Organization data and WIPO data. There may be other countries with time limit options that were not disclosed in this manner.Overview of patenting activity related to COVID-19 19 Figure 6.

Figure 7 highlights those countries with fee relief options available for patent applicants at some point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fee relief provisions were not confined to COVID-19-related patent applications. The patent offices recognized the financial difficulties and economic challenges applicants could encounter during this period. Fee relief provisions primarily included fee deadline extensions. Those countries with more generalized fee relief options are indicated in both orange (Fee deadline extensions) and blue (Fee relief). Countries with case-by-case or request-basis fee relief options are indicated in purple (Fee relief may be possible), and the countries reporting normal operations/no fee relief provisions indicated in gray (No fee relief).

Overview of patenting activity related to COVID-19 21 Licensing and other agreements related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics COVID-19's global impact was recognized by many governments, corporate entities, universities and research organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Many institutions came together during the pandemic to fund, develop, commercialize and supply diagnostics, protective equipment, vaccines and therapeutics. The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), established in 2010 by Unitaid to increase access to and facilitate the development of life-saving medicines for low- and middle-income countries, expanded its mandate in early 2020 in response to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 (MPP, n.d.). A detailed timeline of MPP activities and contributions from January 2020 through May 2022 can be found in Figure A1 in the Annex. Specific items from this timeline are discussed briefly hereafter. In April 2020, MPP began working to leverage its expertise in licensing patented pharmaceuticals and technologies to support efforts to combat COVID-19 (MPP, n.d.). By October of 2020, MPP reported discussions were underway for the licensing of technologies and therapeutics (MPP, n.d.). In late 2021, MPP signed license agreements with two companies, Merck, Sharp & Dohme and Pfizer, for affordable access to COVID-19 therapeutics (MPP, n.d.). In early 2022, MPP signed agreements with generics manufacturers for the supply and production of COVID-19 therapeutics from originators Merck, Sharp & Dohme and Pfizer (MPP, n.d.). The Global Healthcare Innovation Alliance Accelerator (GHIAA), a non-profit organization seeking to collect and provide global health agreements with a focus on agreements related to medical products access, has included COVID-19-related global health agreements in its Master Alliance Provisions Guide (MAPGuide) (GHIAA, n.d.-a). At the time of writing, GHIAA continues to seek the submission of agreements for its collection. In the COVID-19 section of the MAPGuide, a supply/purchase agreement is the most common type. This type of agreement is primarily between government and industry, ensuring the supply of vaccines. Data also include R&D funding agreements, license agreements, contract manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements and R&D collaboration agreements. Also to be found in the MAPGuide are funder-industry agreements, industry agreements and agreements with multilateral organizations (GHIAA, n.d.-b) (Figure 8).Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics22 Figure 8.

Discussions commenced at the 12th Ministerial Conference regarding proposals for extending the Decision's scope to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics (WTO, 2022). The WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (WHO C-TAP) was launched in May 2020 (WHO, n.d.-i). The program's goal is to create affordable and faster access for all countries to COVID-19-related vaccines, therapeutics and other related health products. Governments and non-governmental organizations around the world have engaged in the program.Overview of patenting activity related to COVID-19 23 Disclosure of sequences within COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics patents Sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome in early 2020 was essential for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and identifying targets for therapeutics. Sequencing both the viral genes and the proteins that they encode was important in developing vaccines that stimulate the immune system effectively, treatments that inhibit the virus and diagnostic tests for detecting the virus. Based on the CAS-related sequence indexing, approximately 29 percent of patent families in the overall COVID-19 dataset include biosequences that are claimed to be central to their novelty. Breaking this down by area, 76 percent of vaccine patent families and 16 percent of the therapeutics patent families include biological sequences. These include amino acid and nucleotide sequences related to vaccine development or the design of biologic drugs such as antibodies. Examples of patents in the dataset that disclose different types of biosequences are as follows. Patent applications CN113308493 and WO2021184987 (Guangzhou N Biomed Ltd.) disclose an S-protein-encoding nucleic acid sequence for use in adenovirus vector-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Patent application KR2022014034 (Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology) discloses a peptide that inhibits the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with human angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for use in diagnosing and treating coronavirus infection. Patent application WO2022117085 (Microbio (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, Oneness Biotech Co., Ltd.) discloses nucleic acid target sites for siRNA (small interfering RNA) in SARS-CoV-2 genes. The siRNAs are designed to treat COVID-19 infection. Patent application CN113234150 (Wuhan Frasergen Genomic Medicine Co., Ltd.) discloses a human immunoglobulin G1 single-chain antibody against SARS-CoV-2, for use in vaccine production and antibody drug development. Patent application WO2021245291 (Inotrem) discloses a peptide that inhibits TREM-1, which is involved in COVID inflammatory response. The peptide is for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with complications. Patent application WO2022203448 (Korea University Research and Business Foundation) discloses a siRNA designed to treat SARS-CoV-2 lung damage by targeting microRNA. Patent application WO2021252878 (Vir Biotechnology, Inc.) discloses anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or antibody fragments, for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patent application RU2730897 (Shemayakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry et al. ) discloses antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) and S protein for use in assessing blood antibody levels and measuring immune response in infected patients. Some sequence listings disclosed by patent documents are fed into international collaborative platforms and repositories of sequence information, such as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and the EpiCoV platform of the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), by relevant patent offices or researchers (INSDC, n.d.; GISAID, 2022). Such international information sharing arrangements for the rapid exchange of sequences proved critical to the successful and swift global pandemic response and facilitated the development of vaccines and therapeutics (GISAID, 2022).24 Background - vaccine platforms Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates frequently. As variants emerge and are classified as variants of concern (VOCs), effective vaccination becomes vitally important. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, various vaccine platforms have been explored for vaccine development. They range from conventional vaccine platforms, such as whole-virus vaccines (live attenuated and inactivated vaccines) and protein-based vaccines (virus-like particles and protein subunit vaccines), to novel platforms, such as viral vector-based vaccines, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)-based vaccines and antigen-presenting cells, the last of which having little pre-existing data on safety and efficacy in humans (Li, Tenchov et al. , 2021). Table 6 summarizes the vaccine platforms. A more in-depth discussion of vaccine platforms can be found in the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022). No new vaccine platforms have been identified in the dataset for this report. Table 6. Categories of COVID-19 vaccine platform Conventional Protein-based 21COVID-19 vaccines Table 4.

Inactivated vaccines provide a broad spectrum of protein antigens, whereas protein-based vaccines produce antigens specific to components of the virus. Protein antigens produced from both platforms stimulate a humoral (antibody-mediated) immune response. Interestingly, viral vector vaccines and nucleic acid-based vaccines deliver protein antigen-encoding genes to cells, which subsequently produce the desired antigens and potentially elicit both humoral and cellular (cell-mediated) immune responses (Li, Tenchov et al. , 2021). Figure 9. Vaccine platforms and the ways in which they produce immunogens in cells 18Background - vaccine platforms Multiple vaccine platforms have been explored for COVID-19 vaccine developm ent, with each platform exhibiting unique advantages and disadvantages (Li et al., 2021b). Some of them are conventional, well-established types of vaccine such as the whole-virus vaccines, including both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, the virus-like particles and the protein subunit vaccines, while others, such as the nucleic-acid (DNA and RNA)-based vaccines, the viral- vector-based vaccines and the antigen-presenting cells, are novel, with little pre-existing data on safety and ef/f_icacy in humans. Table 4 provides a summa ry of all the vaccine platforms. Different vaccine platforms may produce an immune response in different ways (Figure 4). Inactivated vaccines provide a broad spectrum of protein antigens against which the body can generate protective antibodies. Protein-based vaccines produce a more focused response to a speci/f_ic antigen. Viral-vector vaccines deliver protein antigen-encod ing genes to cells, which the cells then use to produce proteins against which they generate an immune response . Nucleic acid vaccines are packa ged in a synthetic coating and deliver protein antigen-encod ing genes to cells, which the cells then use to produce proteins and generate immunity.

A detailed discussion of the patent landscape related to COVID-19 vaccines now follows. Information about COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can be found in the Annex. Speed of vaccine development In the early stages of the pandemic, the scientific research community, world leaders and global patent offices responded with urgency, by accelerating vaccine development and associated patent activity. On average, vaccine development takes five to 10 years. However, after the emergence of COVID-19, vaccine development accelerated at an unprecedented rate. Within 11 months of the virus sequence being published, three vaccines were granted emergency use authorization (EUA) or some other form of advanced approval in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom (UK) (Milken Institute, n.d.-b). There are currently an additional 11 vaccines with an emergency use listing with the WHO and dozens more in various stages of development and clinical trial (Milken Institute, n.d.-a). According to the WHO's vaccine tracker (WHO, n.d.-c), as of December 2022, 230 vaccines were in clinical development. Of those, 92 were in Phase 3 trials and 138 in either Phase 1 or 2 trials. A further 50 vaccines have been approved by various governing bodies around the globe. There are several ways in which vaccine development for COVID-19 has been accelerated. Years of vaccine research into other respiratory viruses was leveraged to jump start the search for effective COVID-19 vaccines. Collaborative research was facilitated by tracking vaccine candidates globally and encouraging open discourse between researchers, vaccine developers and regulatory organizations. The WHO, among other organizations, coordinated clinical trials across the world to help accelerate regulatory action. The clinical trial process itself evolved to support faster delivery of effective vaccines. In many cases, Phase 1 trials were completed in Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics26 just two months, by allowing vaccine doses to be administered within a relatively short period, often no more than three to four weeks apart (Johns Hopkins University, n.d.). Furthermore, some COVID-19 clinical trials combined Phases 1 and 2, and others combined Phases 2 and 3 (Johns Hopkins University, n.d.). Owing to the high rates of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, the number of people who could be monitored for disease risk was enormous, which made it easier to identify differences in disease risk between those who had received a vaccine and those who had received a placebo or comparative vaccine. This allowed vaccine efficacy to be determined at a relatively accelerated pace (Johns Hopkins University, n.d.). Lastly, several governments around the world accelerated investment into the manufacturing capacity needed to produce large quantities of vaccine doses before the full results of Phase 3 clinical trials were available (Johns Hopkins University, n.d.). A global discussion on when COVID-19 is likely to become endemic has already begun and with it the pace of research, vaccine development and patent filing activity has slowed relative to the start of the pandemic (see Figure 3). While research continues, including new and ongoing clinical trials, the associated patent filing activity appears to be returning to how it was pre-pandemic. Vaccine patent landscape For this report, we have considered all patent filings related to COVID-19 vaccines. To compile Table 7, each patent office where patent protection was sought by every patent family was counted once (see Annex for an in-depth discussion of patent families). Analysis by patent office revealed that WIPO's PCT system received the most COVID-19-related vaccine patent applications, followed by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). This is in contrast with the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report which considered all COVID-19-related vaccine patent applications from January 2020 through September 2021. During that period, CNIPA received the most patent applications, followed by WIPO, USPTO, Rospatent (the Federal Service for Intellectual Property of the Russian Federation) and the EPO. WIPO's current top ranking is likely to be an indication that patent applicants are leveraging the WIPO/PCT system in order to protect their inventions across multiple jurisdictions. Table 7. Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine patent applications across patent offices Applications related to COVID-19 vaccines were filed at 30 patent offices. WIPO and CNIPA received the most applications, followed by the USPTO, the EPO and others.

The United Kingdom, Japan, India, France, Canada, Switzerland, Israel, Australia, Belgium and Italy rounded out the top 15 applicant origins. Table 8. Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine patents across applicant location Most patent applications were filed by patent applicants in China and the United States.

Applicants in different regions adopted different patent filing strategies during the course of the pandemic. From January 2020 through September 2021 - the period of the first report - patent applicants in China almost exclusively filed their patent applications at CNIPA, with a few exceptions also filing at the USPTO and the EPO (WIPO, 2022). However, during the period covered by this report, extending through September 2022, a much higher percentage of China-based applicants filed their patent applications at WIPO/PCT (Figure A2). Filings made from October 2021 through September 2022 indicate a greater interest more recently by Chinese applicants in seeking patent protection for their inventions across multiple jurisdictions. US-based applicants, on the other hand, continued to file mainly PCT and USPTO applications throughout the pandemic. Diverse filing strategies are seen for applicants based in other countries. Similar trends are seen in the top applicant locations compared to the top offices of filing, but with major differences lower down the ranking. These differences are likely to be a result of different applicant filing strategies. Figure A2 further illustrates where applicants from different origins filed their applications. Vaccine patent distribution by vaccine platform and published applicant location A total of 1,331 patent documents related to COVID-19 vaccine development published up until September 30, 2022, were identified and analyzed. They included a wide variety of vaccine platforms, ranging from conventional platforms, such as protein subunit, inactivated virus, virus-like particle (VLP) and live attenuated virus platforms, to more innovative ones, such as viral vector-based, nucleic acid-based (DNA and RNA based vaccines) and antigen-presenting cell (APC)-based platforms (Figure 10).Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics28 Figure 10. Distribution of COVID-19-related patent applications across vaccine platforms, earliest published month between January 2022 and September 2022 Nearly half (47 percent) of the vaccine patent dataset related to protein subunit vaccines (conventional vaccine platform), followed by patent filings related to viral vector vaccines (novel vaccine platform), which accounted for almost one-quarter (21 percent) of the vaccine patent dataset. Protein subunit Viral vector RNA Inactivated DNA Virus-like particle Live attenu s4096145284 1043968115626 Conventional Novel Source: WIPO, based on patent data from the CAS Content Collection, September 2022. Across platforms, protein subunit vaccine-related patent filings constituted the largest category (626, 47 percent), followed by viral vector (284, 21 percent), RNA (145, 11 percent), inactivated (115, 9 percent), DNA (96, 7 percent), VLP (68, 5 percent) and APC-based vaccine development (40, 3 percent). In addition, 39 patent filings related to live attenuated vaccines and 104 patent filings classified as \"other\" included technologies related to nanoparticles, adjuvants, etc. It was observed that some patent applications claimed more than one type of platform and therefore counted in all the related platforms categories covered in Figure 3. There was a substantial growth in interest around producing vaccines that incorporate novel technologies related to nanoparticles later on in the period covered by the dataset. Nanoparticle use in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provides distinct advantages as they have proven to be suitable delivery vehicles and adjuvants (Huang et al. , 2022). Several of the nanovaccines disclosed in the vaccine dataset use coronavirus spike protein comprising ferritin nanoparticles, which has a higher stability and expression level compared to non-modified coronavirus spike protein. Ferritin, a unique iron-binding protein, can play an important role in COVID-19 vaccine delivery and elicit neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 (Powell et al. , 2021). Nearly 60 nanovaccine candidates were recently in various pre-clinical stages, and approximately 26 nanoparticle-based COVID-19 vaccines undergoing human clinical trials (Rauf et al. , 2022). Examples include: Patent application WO2022087255 (La Jolla Institute for Immunology) discloses a mutant coronavirus S protein, polymeric and ferritin-based nanoparticles that have a higher stability or a higher level of expression when compared to a non-modified coronavirus spike protein. Patent application WO2022027702 (Guangzhou Qianyang Bio-Technology Co., Ltd.) discloses a Helicobacter pylori ferritin-based novel coronavirus S protein subunit nanovaccine able to significantly improve a host's level of neutralizing antibody against the virus, thus preventing the virus from invading a target cell. Patent application WO2022177990 (Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg Inc.) discloses methods for engineering SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Helicobacter pylori ferritin fusion proteins for self-assembly into nanoparticle compositions for use in vaccines, as well as use of the antibodies created by such a vaccine in the prevention or treatment of SARS- CoV-2 infection. Several other patent applications disclose a nucleic acid vaccine, comprising a sequence encoding a SARS-CoV-2 S protein and a lipid nanoparticle vaccine delivery method. Lipid nanoparticles offer a wide spectrum of advantages in comparison to other nanocarriers. They include greater stability, lower cost and the possibility of large-scale industrial manufacturing. Recent lipid nanoparticles usage in the development of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, which have an unrivalled effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 disease, demonstrate a potential application for lipid nanoparticles in the delivery of nucleic acid-based vaccines (Wilson and Geetha, 2022). Examples include: COVID-19 vaccines 29 Patent application WO2022155530 (ModernaTX, Inc.) discloses methods for engineering SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expressing strain-based S protein variants in lipid nanoparticle formulations and their use in mRNA vaccines. Patent application WO2022101469 (BioNTech SE) discloses technologies related to the stabilization of lipid nanoparticle mRNA compositions, including vaccines. Patent applications WO2022129918 (Imperial College Innovations Limited) and WO2022110099 (Guangzhou Argorna Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) disclose novel uses of and methods for thermally stabilizing RNA vaccine formulations, including self-amplifying RNA replicons and genetic constructs encoding such replicons. Patent application WO2022099003 (Sanofi) discloses lipid nanoparticles hemagglutinin antigens and/or neuraminidase antigens. Numerous patent applications published in 2022 focus on adjuvants for virus vaccines, where an adjuvant system might be composed of fungal polysaccharides, endogenous proteins or injectable micro-nanostructures that can act as immunomodulatory agents in the prevention of COVID-19 infection. Further discussion of vaccine adjuvant development can be found below. Some of the vaccines described in the dataset are designed to target not only the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also influenza viruses, cancer, allergies, bacterial infections and other infectious diseases. Among them are: Patent application WO2022011031 (Amyris, Inc.) discloses the synthesis and use of adjuvants in vaccines for diseases caused by viral or bacterial infection. Patent application EP4056579 (Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry AS CR, V.V.I.) discloses 33 cyclic dinucleotides containing isonucleotidic units and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions modifiable by STING protein modulation. Patent application WO2022013277 (Evaxion Biotech A/S) discloses methods and products for treating cancer and infections with microorganisms via the administration of specific fusion polypeptides or nucleic acids encoding such fusion polypeptides. Patent applications related to VLP (virus-like particle) and APC (antigen-presenting cell) vaccine development overtook those of live attenuated vaccines in 2022. Companies designing COVID-19 vaccines are also shifting their focus to rapid, efficient and low-cost synthetic vaccinations. For example, cost-effective vaccine inventions are explored in two patent applications made in the United States (Patent application WO2022061264, University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc.; Patent application WO2022155476, United States Dept. of Health and Human Services). Overall, APC and VLP vaccine inventions are being designed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, prevent virus transmission and for prophylaxis and/or the inhibition of COVID-19 infection. Applicant locations for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine patent filings have increased from 21 to 24 since the first COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report, with the addition of Argentina, Colombia and Iceland. However, China, the United States, Germany, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom remain the leading applicant locations for COVID-19 vaccine development, together accounting for over 80 percent of the vaccine patent dataset (Table 8). Applicants based in China filed 573 patents, those in the United States filed 356 applications, in Germany 57 applications, in the Republic of Korea 56 applications and in the Russian Federation 48 patent applications (Table 8). Vaccine patent application content analysis reveals that many patent filings included more than one vaccine platform. Table 9 shows the spread of patent applications across specific vaccine platforms. A total of 269 patent applications originating from China contained the protein subunit vaccine platform, significantly more than viral vector (134) and other types of platform. Patent applicants based in the United States, Germany, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom demonstrated a similar pattern to those based in China, with the protein subunit vaccine platform found in 166, 26, 38 and 15 patent applications, respectively. However, patent applicants based in the Russian Federation demonstrated a different trend, with the viral vector vaccine platform contained most often in patent applications followed by protein subunit.Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics30 Table 9. Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine patent applications across vaccine platforms and patent applicant locations While China and US-based applicants filed patent applications across different vaccine platforms, including adjuvants and technologies related to nanoparticles, applicants from Germany, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, Japan and others focused on protein subunit, viral vector and RNA vaccine platforms. Russian Federation applicants filed mainly in the field of viral vector vaccines.

Source: WIPO, based on patent data from the CAS Content Collection, September 2022. On closer inspection, the distribution of vaccine patents by geographical region shows that almost 98 percent of patents originated from applicants in Asia, North America and Europe. Applicants from other regions of the world, namely, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania and South America, contributed less than 3 percent to the vaccine patent pool (Table 10). Table 10.

The WHO C-TAP program has been discussed briefly in the section on Licensing and other agreements related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. However, there are studies focusing on collaboration efforts that leverage methods beyond patent filings. For example, partnerships have been studied by evaluating the developers listed for vaccines registered with the WHO (Druedhal et al. , 2021). This section focuses more on patents identified in the vaccine dataset. From the vaccine dataset, nearly one-quarter (24 percent) of patents had more than one patent assignee. Moreover, the majority of collaborations on patent filings were a combination of universities and research institutes and corporate entities. Those organizations that collaborated most frequently are presented in Table 11. For vaccine- related patents, there is no clear pattern of consistent collaboration between organizations. The two organizations that collaborated the most are Liaoning Chengde Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and Tsinghua University as shown in Figure 11. Table 11.

Vaccine authorization and development of key technologies Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, various vaccine platforms have been explored for vaccine development, with several vaccines having received authorization in some form by the end of 2020. Figure 12 shows the timeline for major milestones related to initial COVID-19 vaccine authorization and approval in 2020.COVID-19 vaccines 33 Figure 12.

Source: WIPO, based on data from Zimmer et al. , 2022 and Pinghui, 2020 Decades of vaccine research into coronaviruses and other respiratory diseases facilitated the rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19. The first approved vaccine, CanSino, was a viral vector vaccine that came from China. It was approved on June 24, 2020, for limited use in the Chinese military and in high-risk occupations, for example, for frontline health workers, border officials and overseas workers (Pinghui, 2020). In July, China authorized another vaccine, an inactivated virus vaccine from Sinopharm, also for limited use in high-risk occupations. Throughout the next few months, the Sinopharm vaccine received additional EUA in other countries. Russia first granted emergency use approval for the adenovirus viral vector vaccine, Sputnik V, on August 11, 2020 (Kramer, 2020). It was not until December 2020 that mRNA vaccines received authorization. On December 2, 2020, the United Kingdom granted the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine its first EUA. A fortnight later, the United States granted the Moderna mRNA vaccine its first EUA on December 18, 2020 (Thomas et al. , 2021; USFDA, 2020). The AstraZeneca vaccine was granted its first EUA in the United Kingdom and Argentina on December 30, 2020. The first vaccine to receive full approval was the Sinopharm vaccine, which was granted on December 9, 2020, by the United Arab Emirates. By the end of 2020, many countries, as well as the European Union, had authorized or approved vaccines (European Commission, 2021). Additional authorizations and full approvals followed in 2021 and 2022 for these and other vaccines, such as Janssen (USFDA, Novavax (USFDA, 2022e), Valneva (European Medicines Agency, 2022b). More information on vaccine authorizations can be found on the WHO website (WHO, 2023). A broader discussion related to the timeline of the vaccine technology that enabled COVID-19 vaccine development can be found in the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022). Some of the more recent noteworthy advancements in COVID-19 vaccine development are as follows. The advancement of nucleic acid-based vaccine technologies has been essential to the COVID-19 vaccine landscape. The use of mRNA has several significant advantages over other vaccine technologies in terms of safety, efficacy and production, despite its need for storage at below- freezing temperature. Since mRNA is a non-infectious, non-cell platform there is no potential risk of insertional mutagenesis. Also, mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes and its half-life in the human body can be regulated through various modifications. A variety of modifications make mRNA stable and highly translatable and thus highly efficient. Moreover, mRNA vaccines can be rapidly produced, and their manufacturing relatively easily scaled up. Several patents in the dataset outline advancements related to this technology. Among them are:Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics34 Patent application WO2022067010 Inc.) discloses mRNAs encoding variants of highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 S protein antigens capable of producing powerful neutralizing antibody and immune cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. Patent application WO2022043551 (CureVac protein selected or derived from a coronavirus membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), non-structural protein and/or accessory protein; the composition may additionally comprise nucleic acid encoding a coronavirus S protein. The compositions are in association with a polymeric carrier, a polycationic protein or peptide or a lipid nanoparticle. Patent applications WO2022155530 and WO2022155524 (ModernaTX, Inc.) disclose vaccines comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 S protein, or a 2P stabilized spike antigen of a second circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus, wherein the subject has previously been administered a first vaccine comprising a nucleic acid encoding a first SARS-CoV-2 2P stabilized spike antigen of a first circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus, and wherein each of the first and second 2P stabilized spike antigens are administered in an effective amount to induce an immune response specific for both antigens. Patent applications WO2022101469 and WO2022101470 (BioNTech SE) disclose highly stable lipid nanoparticle mRNA carrier compositions having an improved RNA integrity after a freeze-thaw cycle. The formulation includes cationically ionizable lipid, RNA and aqueous phases comprising a specific buffer system providing improved stability and a ready-to-use composition that can be stored at a temperature range compliant with regular technologies in pharmaceutical practice. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA vaccines are currently considered the most promising and innovative COVID-19 vaccine approach. Vaccine adjuvant development Adjuvants contribute to the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines. These agents are structurally diverse and have been shown to enhance immune response to vaccines through several mechanisms, including through decreasing the amount of antigen required for eliciting immunity, leveraging cytokines and chemokines to recruit white blood cells, and activating helper T-cells (a special type of immune cell) to assist in antibody production (Figure 13). COVID-19 vaccines 35 Figure 13. Adjuvant impact on vaccine efficacy The addition of an adjuvant enhances innate, T-cell, B-cell and memory cell immune responses to vaccines. Source: Awate et al. , 2013. A more detailed discussion of the general history of vaccine adjuvant development can be found in the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022). Most COVID-19 vaccines employ adjuvants that are exogenous materials and have existing clinical approval (i.e., aluminum salts, MP59, saponin mixtures and CpG oligonucleotides). However, newer research has shown that some adjuvants can be incorporated directly into vaccine formulations. The adjuvants in question include nucleic acids, lipids, lectins and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interestingly, the functionality of some of these built-in adjuvants, such as PAMPs and DAMPs, is mediated by host receptors. In light of this, synthetic agents targeting those receptors are being developed so as to improve the adjuvanticity of these agents. Examples of adjuvants used in publicly available COVID-19 vaccines include: Aluminum salt (alum) - used in BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac vaccines SARS-CoV-2 virus Pulendran , 2021).Patent therapeutics36 Matrix-M/IscoMatrix - comprising saponin - used in NVX-CoV2373 vaccine (Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein) (Keech et al. , 2020). MF59 - comprising squalene oil-in-water emulsion - used in recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a soluble protein or on virus-like particles (Ko and Kang, 2018). AS03 - squalene oil-in-water emulsion plus -tocopherol - used in recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a soluble protein or on virus-like particles (Pulendran et al. , 2021). CpG 1018 - comprising synthetic DNA alone or formulated with Alum - used in recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein on virus-like particles used vaccines (Pulendran et al. , 2021). In the initial stages of the pandemic corresponding to the early period of the patent dataset, patent filings focused heavily on vaccine development and their primary active ingredients. Later on in the dataset, while vaccine development remained the primary focus of patent filings, there was an increase in patents that focused on adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines. Among recent patents that disclose advancements in adjuvant formulations are: Patent application CN113842455 (Beijing Health Guard Biotechnology Inc.) discloses an adjuvant for novel coronavirus vaccine and bivalent vaccine containing the novel coronavirus epidemic HuB strain and the South African mutant strain B.1.351 antigen. The adjuvant exhibits the advantages of a more stable sodium acetate buffer system for COVID-19 vaccine protein and a high level of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity. Patent application CN114504641 (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute) discloses a vaccine adjuvant, which can prolong the retention time of vaccine antigen in the nasal cavity by using the calcium ion-binding protein S100A4 as an adjuvant, thereby providing sufficient time for antigen-presenting cells to take up and present the foreign antigen. Furthermore, because S100A4 is an endogenous protein widespread within the human body, the vaccine adjuvanted with S100A4 is able to avoid the body's immune response to the adjuvant, making this adjuvant suitable for repeated vaccination with different vaccine antigens. Patent application IN202041036825 (Bharat Biotech International Limited) discloses a novel TLR7/8 agonist, Algel-IMDG, chemisorbed onto the surface of aluminum hydroxide gel, that has been used as an adjuvant or an immunomodulator. Patent application WO2020244483 (LIANG, Pi-Hui) discloses novel compounds with a lipophilic moiety, such as a lipid, fatty acid, polyethylene glycol via a carboxyl on the of the triterpene saponin, such . This enhances their adjuvant effects on humoral and cell mediated immunity. Patent application WO2021178306 (Dynavax Technologies Corporation) discloses a SARS-CoV-2 S protein-stable antigen adjuvanted with a TLR-9 agonist CpG oligonucleotide named MVC-COV1901 for protection against COVID-19 and suitable for stimulating an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Patent applications WO2021185874 (Mead Johnson Nutrition Company et al. ) and WO2021185876 (Mead Johnson Nutrition Company et al. ) disclose use of lactoferrin as an immunological adjuvant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 before, during and/or after administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine patenting activity compared to global discussion around COVID-19 vaccines When COVID-19 emerged onto the global stage, little was known about the illness. Global discussion began by focusing on vaccines. Very quickly, mRNA vaccines became the primary focus of global discussion. First mention of an mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 was made in early 2020 and this category of vaccine has since had an ongoing and persistent presence in news articles, media reports, and social media posts. This can be largely attributed to the fact that the rapidity of development, application and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines was novel and there is the potential for their widespread use in combating other pathogens (Abbasi, 2020). COVID-19 vaccines 37 The relative frequency of discussion about and usage of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 is at variance with the patenting activity seen in the dataset related to these vaccines. When comparing the number of doses given (Our World in Data, n.d.) of the different categories of vaccines to the number of patents in the dataset a large discrepancy emerges. In the United States, Canada and the European Union, mRNA vaccines account for the vast majority of vaccine doses administered (95 percent), whereas China has almost exclusively administered inactivated vaccines and Africa primarily viral vector vaccines (Our World in Data, n.d.; Statista, n.d.; WHO - Africa Region, n.d.). Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines account for the majority of vaccinations in the western world, patents related to these vaccines account for only 11 percent of the dataset. Conversely, protein subunit vaccines account for less than 1 percent of vaccine doses administered in these same global regions (Our World in Data, n.d.; Statista, n.d.; WHO - Africa Region, n.d.), but make up the largest portion (47 percent) of the vaccine patent dataset. This volume of COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine patents is influenced by the very nature of other vaccine technologies. More traditional vaccine technologies that leverage the whole pathogen can struggle to provide needful protection without adverse reactions (Heidary et al. , 2022). Additional research and vaccine options are required in such cases. Protein subunit vaccines overcome this challenge by only including those antigenic components of the pathogen required to elicit an effective immune response (Heidary et al. , 2022) and are therefore an attractive alternative that still leverages a well-studied vaccine technology. The frequent use of mRNA vaccines is largely owing to their consistent effectiveness in preventing serious COVID-19 illness (Klobucista, 2022), which further elevates discussion around these vaccines. The relatively limited patent activity related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines can be attributed to the general costs associated with the research and intellectual property claims for key components. Indeed, Gaviria and Kilic (2021) argue that the complex web of patents, trade secrets and licensing activity related to mRNA vaccine technology could limit innovative product commercialization in this area. This does not, however, limit the interest in mRNA vaccines and it is likely they will continue to be a major focus of global discussion around COVID-19, scientific innovation and public health due to their rapid development and unique advantages brought to light by human clinical trials. Patterns in global COVID-19 vaccine use Achieving equality, equity and justice in global COVID-19 vaccine distribution and usage has been challenging. Over 30 countries have only vaccinated less than 10 percent of their population (Beaubien, 2022). According to the UN health agency, just over 3 percent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to 60.2 percent in high-income countries (United Nations, 2022). Several factors, as described below, have impacted the campaign for global vaccine distribution and usage. For 57 countries, income level tends to correlate with the vaccination rates for their population (Our World in Data, n.d.). Countries with the highest incomes have been vaccinating 10 times faster than those with the lowest (Bloomberg, n.d.). As of December 1, 2022, 68.5 percent of the world's population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, vaccination rates vary according to a country's wealth. Around 80 percent of people living in upper middle- and high-income countries had received at least one dose of vaccine, while 63.8 percent of people living in lower middle-income and only 24.6 percent of those living in low-income countries had been vaccinated (Our World in Data, n.d.). Low- and middle-income countries make up 85 percent of the world's population (Yarlagadda et al. , 2022). The main obstacles to vaccine adoption in low-income countries are cost and access. The difficulty of cold transportation and storage in rural and high-altitude regions, lack of infrastructure, lack of manufacturing facilities and the instability caused by conflict and war hindered COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The costs of vaccine manufacture and delivery to these countries are enormous and represent a major barrier. Additionally, even in some wealthy nations, large portions of the population live in what is known as vaccine deserts, that is, where people have little or no convenient access to vaccination based on geographical location. In the United States, for example, there are 17 million people living in rural vaccine deserts and more than 50 million living in urban vaccine deserts across the country (Kansal et al. , n.d.).Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics38 Intellectual property rights, trade policies and manufacturing access have all been designated factors related to vaccine availability. Most pharmaceutical companies are based in high- income countries in the northern hemisphere, which could have also created difficulties for access and distribution to lower income southern countries. In June 2022, the World Trade Organization, at its 12th Ministerial Conference adopted the MC12 Decision on the TRIPS Agreement. The Decision includes a waiver of the requirement set out in Article (f) that authorized use be predominantly to supply its domestic market, therefore allowing the producing Member to export any quantity of COVID-19 vaccines. With regard to the obligation to protect regulatory test data required under Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement, the Decision specifies that this does not prevent an eligible Member from taking steps for rapidly approving the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Decision also clarifies certain TRIPS flexibilities to enable Members to limit the exclusive effect of patent rights (WTO, 2022). There are two global initiatives addressing the manufacturing and distribution deficit. The mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub seeks to enable low- and middle-income countries to build the capacity to manufacture mRNA-based vaccines locally through collaboration among universities, biotech and pharmaceutical companies based in 15 (mostly southern) countries (Maxmen, 2022; WHO, n.d.-e). The COVAX (COVID-19 vaccines global access) initiative coordinates the international distribution of donated vaccines and aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines in order to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world (WHO, n.d.-b). Low- and middle-income countries depend heavily on COVAX to supply vaccines for their populations (Yarlagadda et al. , 2022). In wealthier countries, attitude and opinion influenced vaccine adoption. Public concern over the safety of new vaccines, as well as misconceptions spread online and via social media, drove vaccine hesitancy in middle- and high-income countries (Yarlagadda et al. , 2022). COVID-19 vaccine booster patenting activity The purpose of a booster vaccine is to increase immune response and restore vaccine effectiveness (WHO, 2021b; Nealon, 2021). Over time, the degree of immune protection provided by primary vaccination wanes. Booster vaccines are administered during a specific period after primary vaccination, when immunity is known to begin to decline (WHO, 2022a). Boosters are generally considered safe and effective at increasing immune response and some studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccine boosters elevate SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody levels (Burckhardt et al. , 2022). Patents related to booster vaccines make up a small percentage of the overall vaccine patent dataset. Only around 5 percent of patents in this dataset emphasized booster use. Even fewer - under 1 percent - mention booster use in either the title or abstract. This contrasts with the extensive media discussion, government recommendations and policy debates surrounding the availability and use of boosters and is indicative of the secondary use of many vaccines, with little to no modification, as boosters. Most public health officials agree that high-risk groups, such as health care workers, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly, should have priority access to booster vaccines (Meng et al. , 2022). According to the WHO and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommendations, \"booster doses should be offered based on evidence that doing so would have substantial impact on reducing hospitalization, severe disease and death, and to protect health systems\" (WHO, 2022a). Data show a short-term benefit for an additional booster dose of mRNA vaccine in health care workers, people aged over 60 and those with compromised immune systems (WHO, 2022a). However, booster doses may not be needed by all fully vaccinated individuals (Burckhardt et al. , 2022). Indeed, preliminary data suggest that in younger people the benefit is minimal (WHO, 2022a). Heterologous boosters (i.e., of a different vaccine platform than the primary vaccine) induce better immune responses and offer greater protection than do homologous boosters (i.e., of the same platform) (Meng et al. , 2022). Some believe that periodic boosters may be required over the next few years in order to sustain immunity (Nealon, 2021). More recently developed bivalent boosters show promise for improving immune response against variants (Chalkias et al. , 2022), but some studies show that most of the antibodies elicited by vaccines targeting newer variants continue to recognize only the COVID-19 vaccines 39 original virus, because of \"immune imprinting,\" whereby the body repeats its immune response to the first variant encountered. Longer-term response and the ability to overcome immune imprinting are still under investigation (Mandavilli, 2022). Two research groups examined levels of neutralizing antibodies and differences in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses after receiving monovalent and bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines to protect against omicron variants. Neither group found bivalent booster vaccines induced superior immune responses compared to monovalent vaccines (Collier et al. , 2022; Wang et al. , 2022). However, finetuning booster vaccine dosage might increase the efficacy against immune-escape COVID-19 variants (Offit, 2023). COVID-19 vaccine boosters usage tends to correlate with the economic status of countries. Data on booster coverage by country and income level show that high-income economies have higher levels of booster vaccination (Hamadeh et al. , 2022), whereas low-income regions have very low booster usage, with middle-income countries ranging between the two (pandemic, n.d.). The use of boosters in more affluent countries may also limit the availability of primary vaccines in poorer countries. In 2021, the WHO Director General recommended a moratorium on booster vaccination through the end of the year for the sake of global equity in vaccine access (WHO, 2021c). That guidance has since been updated to recommend booster vaccination under certain criteria (WHO, 2022a). 40 Background - therapeutic categories Like the development of therapeutics in other areas, two major categories of COVID-19 therapeutics have been explored: small molecule and biologic (also known as biopharmaceutical). Small molecule therapeutics are usually organic compounds, either synthetic or derived from a natural source, with a molecular weight of less than 1,000 Daltons (Da). Biologic therapeutics are relatively complex molecules, derived from a biological system, such as from living cells or blood, or produced using biotechnologies, such as recombinant DNA technology, with a molecular weight greater than 1,000 Da. Owing to the relative ease of development and production, small molecule therapeutics are typically more accessible and less costly than biologic therapeutics (Makurvet, 2021). Table 12 provides an overview of the primary therapeutic types encountered in the patent dataset. A more detailed discussion of biologic therapeutics can be found in the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022). Table 12. Categories of COVID-19 therapeutics Small molecule A broad category of organic chemical compounds with a molecule size smaller than 1,000 Da. These molecules can be synthesized chemically or extracted from natural sources (natural products) Traditional medicine Crude preparations of medicines produced according to the principles of traditional medicinal practice. These preparations usually are composed of a mixture of natural plant parts boiled in a liquid (decoction) or made into small balls or granules Biologics A broad category of large molecules produced from living systems or with the use of advanced biotechnologies such as recombinant DNA technology. Biologics are usually large molecules (>1,000 Da) complex in structure. Subclasses of biologics in the context of this report are listed below Antibodies Proteins that constitute part of the human immune system for identifying and neutralizing pathogens. Antibody biologics for COVID-19 treatment may be either obtained from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 or manufactured in large quantities using recombinant DNA technologies with the assistance of other biotechnologies Cell therapy Viable cells with or without modification, which can be placed into the human body to produce a beneficial effect Nucleic acids Biopolymers - essential to all forms of life - that store genetic information. They include DNA and RNA. Nucleic acid biologics in the context of this report include small interfering RNA, antisense nucleotides, and so on Peptides and proteinsLarge molecules (or biopolymers) made of chains of amino acids. They occur naturally in organisms but can also be produced synthetically (for some peptides) or with the use of recombinant DNA technology Other biologics CRISPR-related, probiotics, exosomes, and so on Source: CAS, National Science Library, n.d. Selection of drug targets is a critical step in drug design. All the enzymes and proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus replication, as well as the host proteins mediating inflammation and tissue damage, are potential drug targets. To date, the R&D of COVID-19 therapeutics has focused primarily on two categories of biological targets: 1. therapeutics that target a viral protein/gene, such as the coronavirus S protein, 3cLpro protease, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; and 2. therapeutics that target a human protein involved in mediating viral entry into human cells (such as ACE2) or the exaggerated inflammatory process (cytokine storm) caused by the excess release of cytokine proteins triggered by virus infection, which may lead to tissue damage or dysfunction. By acting on one of these targets, COVID-19 therapeutics may inhibit viral entry, block virus replication inside a host cell, enhance the immune system's ability to fight the virus, alleviate the cytokine storm or impact other physiological processes that may disarm or weaken the virus. A detailed discussion of the patent landscape related to COVID-19 therapeutics now follows. Information about clinical trials of COVID-19 therapeutics can be found in the Annex.COVID-19 therapeuticsCOVID-19 therapeutics 41 Therapeutics patent landscape For this report, we considered all patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics from January 2020 through September 2022. For each patent family, every patent office where patent protection was sought was counted once (see Annex for an in-depth discussion of patent families). Analysis by patent office revealed that WIPO/PCT received the most COVID-19 therapeutics-related patent applications, followed by CNIPA, USPTO, EPO and KIPO (Table 13). This contrasts with the first COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report, which showed that during the January 2020 through September 2021 period, CNIPA received the most patent applications followed by WIPO, USPTO, the Indian Patent office and EPO. As already highlighted, WIPO's current top ranking is an indication that patent applicants are leveraging the PCT system to protect their inventions across multiple jurisdictions. Table 13. Distribution of COVID-19 therapeutic patent applications across patent offices WIPO, CNIPA and USPTO received the largest volume of patent applications related to COVID-19 therapeutics. Patent offices of filing for COVID-19 therapeuticsNumber of patent applications WIPO 3,064 China 1,847 US 815 EPO 362 Republic of Korea 295 India 247 Australia 176 Canada 166 Japan 138 Russian Federation 85 Brazil 58 Germany 46 Argentina 27 France 22 Turkey 19 Colombia 15 Israel 7 Source: WIPO, based on patent data from the CAS Content Collection, September 2022. When considering applicant location, China, the United States, the Republic of Korea, India and Germany are the top five origins (Table 14). Patent applications filed by applicants based in these countries together accounted for about 78 percent of total patent filings in therapeutics. Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics42 Table 14. Distribution of COVID-19 therapeutic patents across applicant locations The majority of patents related to COVID-19 therapeutics were filed by applicants located in China and the United States. Patent applicant location Number of patent families China 1,850 US 1,447 Republic of Korea 229 India 195 Germany 184 Japan 135 France 110 UK 107 Switzerland 83 Russian Federation 78 Canada 71 Israel 62 Australia 48 Turkey 36 Austria 29 Belgium 24 Source: WIPO, based on patent data from the CAS Content Collection, September 2022. Patent filing strategies for COVID-19 therapeutic patents followed a similar pattern to that of COVID-19 vaccine patents. From January 2020 through September 2021, patent applicants in China almost exclusively filed therapeutics patent applications with CNIPA, with a few exceptions where filings were made at WIPO, the USPTO and a few other offices (WIPO, 2022). For the period covering January 2020 through September 2022, a higher percentage (27 percent) of China-based applicants filed applications at WIPO/PCT followed by a very small portion (2.5 percent) at USPTO. This difference is almost entirely accounted for by the filings made from October 2021 through September 2022, indicating Chinese applicants' more recent interest in seeking patent protection for their inventions more widely. In contrast, throughout the entire period covered by this report, US-based applicants sought protection of their intellectual property at USPTO and WIPO, but also filed their patents in many more jurisdictions, including EPO, the Canadian Patent Office and the Australian Patent Office, albeit in relatively smaller numbers. This trend reflects the interest of US patent applicants in seeking patent protection for their inventions across multiple jurisdictions and markets. Applicants from Russia, India and the Republic of Korea filed patents in a similar fashion to applicants from China by mainly filing with WIPO and at their home country patent office. Applicants from both the United Kingdom and Germany filed patents mostly with WIPO and at the EPO. Figure A3 in the Annex further illustrates where applicants from different locations filed therapeutic patent applications. Therapeutic patent distribution by substance type and published applicant location We identified and analyzed 4,968 patent documents related to the development of COVID-19 therapeutics published from January 2020 through September 2022. Patents were first categorized by type of therapeutics (see Table 12). As shown in Figure 14, small molecule therapeutics constituted the biggest category (2,514, 50 percent). Patents related to biologics accounted for the next largest group (2,142, 43 percent). Within this category of therapeutics, peptides/proteins therapeutics made up the largest subset (1,007, 20 percent), followed by antibodies (738, 15 percent), nucleic acid-based (337, 7 percent), cell-based therapy (186, 4 percent) and other biologics (59, 1 percent), for example, exosomes, CRISPR and probiotics. In addition, 10 percent of patent documents (523) described the use of traditional medicine and a very limited number (144, 3 percent) described the use of COVID-19 therapeutics 43 miscellaneous potential therapeutics, such as polymers and nanoparticles (classified as \"others\"). It is worth noting that some patent applications described the use of more than one category of therapeutics, and a few applications described the use of both vaccines and therapeutics. As a result, the total percentage value of all the categories together is more than 100 percent. Figure 14. Distribution of COVID-19-related patent applications across therapeutic categories and subcategories, with earliest published month between January 2020 and September 2022 Patents related to small molecule therapeutics dominate the dataset, followed by patents related to biologic therapeutics.

While applicants in China and the United States filed about an equal number of small molecule and biologics-related patents, China-based applicants, unsurprisingly, filed many more patents disclosing the use of traditional medicine in treating patients with COVID-19 compared to the United States (Table 15). Also not unexpected, applicants in the Republic of Korea and India likewise filed more traditional medicine patents compared to applicants in the United States. When considering the wide range of biologics platforms, China-based applicants filed more antibody patents, fewer protein/peptide patents and fewer cell therapy patents compared to their US-based counterparts.

Applicants from the other regions of the world, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania and South America, contributed less than 4 percent to the therapeutic patent pool (Table 16). Table 16.

Therapeutics patent applicant collaborations Earlier the WHO C-TAP program was briefly described in the section on Licensing and other agreements related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Although there are studies that use several other methods to understand collaboration, for the scope of this report, patent collaborations have been the subject of focus. For example, data sharing for clinical trial data, geospatial tracking of infection statistics, or information libraries to enable machine learning for drug discovery or drug re-purposing (Palm et al. , 2021). This section of the report focuses more on patents identified in the therapeutics dataset. From the therapeutics dataset, 24 percent of patents had more than one patent assignee. Within the dataset, organizations with the most collaborations on patent filings were universities and research institutes (Table 17).COVID-19 therapeutics 45 Table 17. Top patent applicant collaborators in COVID-19 therapeutic patent applications Organizations with the most collaborations on patent filings were universities and research institutes.

Some act directly on the virus to block its entry into human cells or else stop it from replicating once inside a human cell. Others either enhance the immune system's ability to fight the virus or attenuate the type of immune-system overreaction seen in the cytokine storms which affect many patients with severe COVID-19. As of December 1, 2022, remdesivir (Veklury) was the only antiviral drug to be fully approved in the United States for the treatment of COVID-19. It has also been approved or authorized for emergency or temporary use by authorities in around 50 other countries worldwide, including Australia, the European Union, India, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan province of China and the United Kingdom (RAPS, n.d-a). Veklury is a SARS-2-CoV-2 nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and children aged 28 days or older and weighing at least 3 kg, who are either hospitalized or not, have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and at a high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (Gilead, n.d.). Recent patents related to superior remdesivir formulations are: Patent application WO2022020940 (Apotex tosylate, hydrochloride, phosphate, maleate and oxalate, as well as pharmaceutical compositions including remdesivir salts and the crystalline forms thereof, and their use in the treatment of a viral infection, particularly one caused by SARS-CoV-2. Patent application WO2022091122 (Cipla Limited) discloses stable formulations of a nucleotide analog prodrug, in particular remdesivir, in the form of ready-to-use (RTU) and ready-to-dilute (RTD) formulations free of cyclodextrins. Patent application WO2022016073 (The University of Texas System Board of Regents; TFF Pharmaceuticals Inc.) discloses pharmaceutical compositions of remdesivir that may be inhaled directly into the lungs. Combination therapies: o Patent application WO2022029275 (Nuvamid SA) discloses a combination of remdesivir and nicotinamide mononucleotide derivatives. o Patent application WO2022015982 (The Regents of the University of California) discloses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, such as remdesivir, and a second therapeutic agent for treating infection with an RNA virus. o Patent application WO2022076386 (Montelione, Gaetano T. et al. ) discloses inhibitors (pLpro), strongly synergistic as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) including remdesivir, as well as orally ingestible polymerase inhibitors, such as molnupiravir. o Patent application WO2022035911 (Tutela Pharmaceuticals) discloses a combination of an FKBP ligand, such as tacrolimus, everolimus or sirolimus, and an antiviral agent, such as the RNA polymerase inhibitors remdesivir the protease inhibitor M128533. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) is recommended by the WHO in the treatment of COVID-19, if specific criteria are met. Other health agencies and authorities in specific countries may have recommendations that differ from that of the WHO. The drug has received either EUA or conditional approval in many countries, including in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and China (RAPS, n.d.-a). Highlights of patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics developmentPatent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics48 Molnupiravir, an oral, broad-spectrum antiviral, has a similar mechanism of action to remdesivir and prevents virus replication. The WHO has conditionally recommended its use in treating patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing severe disease (RAPS, n.d.-a). Molnupiravir is the first oral COVID-19 antiviral drug to receive EUA in the United States. Several other countries have also granted it a EUA or conditional approval, including the United Kingdom, Australia, India and South Africa (RAPS, n.d.-a). Several patents in the dataset refer to Molnupiravir, focusing primarily on the process used to prepare the drug, as exemplified by patent application WO2022200847 (Optimus Drugs Private Limited). In November 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) authorized the drug anakinra (Kineret) for emergency use. It had previously received authorization for use in treating certain hospitalized adults with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 (RAPS, n.d.-a). Two patent applications in the dataset, namely, WO2021185838 (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB) and WO2021113334 (Altavant Sciences GmbH), disclose effective methods for administering Kineret to COVID-19 patients to treat or alleviate respiratory distress. Other COVID-19 therapeutics to have received EUA or conditional approval in some countries are Bebtelovimab and Olumiant (baricitinib) (RAPS, n.d.-a). Many more small molecule therapeutics for COVID-19 are currently undergoing clinical development. Biologic therapeutics This section addresses therapeutics In general, antibody therapeutics has seen the fastest growth relative to other classes of biologics over the past two decades. Therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19 generally fall into either of two categories: 1. Virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins (e.g., the S protein) that can be obtained from patients recovered after COVID-19 or manufactured using biotechnologies. 2. Antibodies that modulate the human immune system's response to the virus that are typically manufactured using biotechnologies. While there have been several antibody therapeutics granted EUA to treat patients with COVID-19 (e.g., Bamlanivimab, Bebtelovimab, Etesevimab and Sotrovimab), several of these have recently been found to be no longer effective in some regions of the world (e.g., the United States), due the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants (USFDA, 2022b; USFDA, 2022c). Thus, there is a need for new antibody therapeutics that are broad spectrum and/or multivalent and effective against new or predominant variants. Examples of some inventions beginning to address this need are: Patent application CN114573691 (The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University et al. ) describes an anti-spike S1 protein neutralizing antibody active against several variants, including Omicron B.1.1.529. Patent application WO2022073138 (The Hospital for Sick Children) discloses a MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody) platform for making multivalent neutralizing antibodies using human apoferritin chains to help multimerize specific for SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins (Rujas et al. , 2021). Patent application WO2022074628 (The Governing Council of the University of Toronto) discloses single-chain antibodies able to bind to more than one region of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. While monoclonal therapeutic antibodies have been generated for many years using hybridoma and phage display technologies, use of chimeric animals expressing human immunoglobulin Highlights of patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics development 49 genes and/or cloning of single human B cells for production of desired antibodies has become more popular within the last decade (Lu et al. , 2020). The generation of fully human antibodies from transgenic animals (such as rats or mice) accounts for the increasing number of new therapeutics (Bruggemann et al. , 2015). Patent application WO2022046286 (SAb Biotherapeutics) discloses polyclonal antibody SAB-185, specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, made using ungulates (bovine) genetically engineered to produce fully human immunoglobulins. As the virus continues to mutate, the use of polyclonal antibodies, such as SAB-185, has the potential to drive higher levels of effectiveness compared to monoclonal antibodies. SAB-185 was evaluated in clinical trials for use in treating patients with COVID-19, but owing to a decline in COVID-19 hospitalizations its Phase 3 ACTIV-2 trial was suspended (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; BioSpace, 2022). Instead of designing antibodies that target viral proteins, some patents evaluated antibodies that target those host (human) proteins implicated in the infection process with a view to modulating the immune system response. Such a strategy may result in more effective therapeutics better able to address the continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, since it focuses on host proteins rather than the continually changing viral proteins. Examples of such patents are: Patent application WO2022204274 (Alector) discloses anti-TMEM106B antibodies that reduce viral cell entry and release of the virus from infected cells. These antibodies were shown to be as effective as Remdesivir at reducing cytopathic effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells. Patent application WO2022140697 (The Regents of the University of California) discloses anti-CD32b antibodies that could be used to block CD32b and restore interferon responses in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Patent application WO2021243396 (Implicit Bioscience Limited) discloses anti-CD14 antibodies effective in tempering the immune system's harmful inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. Over 10,000 published and/or patented antibodies and nanobodies that bind to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are available in the Coronavirus-Binding Antibody Sequences & Structures database released by the Oxford Protein Informatics Group, Department of Statistics, University of Oxford (OPIG, 2022). Non-antibody peptide and protein therapeutics Peptide-mediated therapy The primary strategy for using peptides to treat patients with COVID-19 centers on therapeutic peptides (usually with a chain length of under 20 amino acids) that inhibit the virus's ability to bind and/or enter host cells (Moroy and Tuffery, 2022). The dataset includes patents that explore this strategy and disclose peptides targeting the S protein-ACE or S-protein-Neuropilin-1 interactions. Examples of such patents are: Patent application WO2022040803 Biopharma) discloses C-terminal peptides of soricidin (a in the venomous saliva of Blarina brevicauda ) that inhibit interaction between the SARS CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2. Soricidin peptides are also known to inhibit transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6) and reduce cytoplasmic calcium influx. Patent application BR102020023728 (Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1) discloses peptides derived from plant proteins (chitin-binding protein CBP3, 2S albumin-like protein and chitinase) that inhibit the S protein. Patent application WO2021224803 (NONO) presents the use of viral peptides linked to an internalization peptide that helps facilitate entry into tissues or cells. The peptides bind to human host factors, such as neuropilin-1, and interfere with viral entrance. An alternative approach uses peptides specific for host proteins rather than peptides that inhibit virus-host cell interaction. This strategy includes generating peptides from known mammalian proteins (e.g., carbohydrate-binding protein CLEC4G, tumor necrosis factor lectin-like domain (TIP) and -defensin-4) for use in treating COVID-19 patients. Examples of such patents are: Patent application EP4039268 (IMBA-Institut f\u00fcr Molekulare Biotechnologie GmbH) novel therapeutic intervention targeting virus-specific glycosylation. Because many N-glycosylation sites on the S protein are conserved, the use of CLEC4G peptides that interact with S proteins and block SARS-CoV-2 entry has potential as a pan-variant therapeutic strategy. Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics50 Patent application WO2021185071 (The University of Hong Kong) discloses the use of peptide P9R derived from mouse -defensin-4 in treating patients with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19. P9R binds to the virus and inhibits virus-host endosome acidification, which is a key stage in the life cycle of many pH-dependent viruses. This invention discloses that the antiviral activity of P9R can be enhanced by increasing its net positive charge. Patent application WO2021223894 (Apeptico Forschung und Entwicklung GmbH) discloses the use of Solnatide (a cyclic peptide derived from human TIP) in treating life-threatening lung failure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. It has been tested in clinical trial on patients with COVID-19 and preliminary data support the use of solnatide in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (Solnatide, n.d.). Protein-mediated therapy Larger non-antibody proteins (> approximately 50 amino acids), including fusion proteins, cytokines (soluble interferon 2b and pegylated 2b) and other proteins (recombinant human proteins ACE2, arginase 1 and CC10) are also being explored as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. Examples of patents featuring non-antibody proteins are: Patent application WO2021191436 (Apeiron Biologics AG et al. ) discloses that recombinant soluble human ACE2, known as GSK2586881 (APN-01 or Alunacedase alfa), acts as a decoy molecule and is useful in treating or preventing COVID-19 (Apeiron Biologics, n.d.). Patent applications WO2021212220 (Altum Pharmaceuticals et al. ) and WO2021245541 (Cadila HealthCare Limited) present the use of recombinant soluble human interferon 2b and pegylated 2b, respectively, in treating and/or preventing viral infections like those caused by SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy and safety of APN-01, recombinant 2b and pegylated 2b has been studied in patients with COVID-19 (U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d.; Li, Luo et al. , 2021; Bhushan et al. , 2021). The first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report highlighted several patents using ACE2-Fc antibody fusion proteins as decoy proteins with a greater affinity for the S protein compared to human ACE2 (WIPO, 2022). By binding to the S protein, ACE2-Fc antibody fusion proteins prevent the S protein interacting with ACE2 on human host cells. Although they have shown therapeutic promise, there remains a need for novel approaches to achieve multivalent therapeutic outcomes using ACE2 to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its ever-changing VOCs (Obeng et al., 2022). There are patents present in the dataset that begin to address this need by utilizing different approaches for first engineering variant ACE2 proteins and then using them to create immunoglobulin (Ig) Fc fusion proteins or non-immunoglobulin multimers for use in therapy. In most examples, the ACE2 undergoes modifications for enhanced binding to the S-protein and the addition of the Fc region of Ig helps to stabilize and increase its half-life. Examples of such patents are: Patent application WO2022184854 (Formycon AG) discloses that ACE2-IgG4 constructs v1261 and v1263, which were constructed using the IgG4 Fc fragment instead of IgG1 to avoid potential undesirable antibody-dependent disease enhancements, are effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 VOCs Industry-University Cooperation Foundation Hanyang University) presents the cloning of stabilized Ace2(N51C/V343C)-Fc protein, wherein the ACE2 is modified to enable disulfide bonding leading to a more stable therapeutic compound without affecting its function. Patent application WO2021183717 (NantCell) discloses ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1Fc, a triple mutant ACE2 decoy, displaying favorable biophysical characteristics compared to other triple ACE2 proteins and showing high S protein RBD affinity (Tanaka et al. , 2021). Patent application WO2022012688 (Shenzhen Bay Laboratory) discloses ACE2-Ig-v4.1, a hexavalent ACE2-Ig made of four truncated ACE2-740-D30E and two truncated ACE2-615- D30E proteins, which shows at least a 10-fold higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency compared to bivalent forms.Highlights of patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics development 51 Nucleic acid-based therapeutics One of the most strategies to et al. , 2020). NATs can be designed to inhibit replication or infection processes associated with SARS-CoV-2, as well as inhibit host factors, all of which may help quell the cytokine storm seen in some COVID-19 patients. Although NATs possess some advantages (e.g., high specificity, ease of design and lower production costs), more advances and testing are required to improve their safety, deliverability, scalability and effectiveness. This is especially true for miRNAs, owing to research having identified several miRNAs associated with COVID-19 infection with the greatest potential to break COVID-19 infection in general and suppress cytokine storms in particular (Abusalah et al. , 2022). Examples of patents disclosing the use of NATs in the treatment of patients exposed to SARS- CoV-2 are: Patent application WO2021186396 (Oncotelic, 2021) discloses the OT-101, a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) antisense oligonucleotide, for use in treating respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. It has been tested in clinical trials, and in October 2022 Oncotelic received a U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contract to develop OT-101 for treating patients after COVID-19 infection (Pharmaceutical Technology, 2022). Patent application WO2021248027 (Ionis Pharmaceuticals) discloses the design of 3-10-3 gapmer antisense oligonucleotides specific for SARS-CoV-2 isolate factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These gapmer oligonucleotides stimulate RNA degradation by recruiting RNase H and have been found to have some advantages compared to other antisense oligonucleotides, such as a high binding affinity to the target (Roberts et al. , 2020). Patent application WO2021252557 (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals) discloses the siRNAs AD-1184150 and AD-1184137 targeting COVID-19 and AD-1230934 targeting ACE2 and looks at their efficacy when delivered intranasally to hamsters. All three siRNAs were shown to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, with an intranasal combination of AD-1184150 and AD-1184137 superior to subcutaneous administration. Patent application WO2022203448 (Korea University Research and Business Foundation) discloses siRNAs exhibiting anti-fibrotic miRNA activity with an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 for use in treating patients with COVID-19. The bioinformatics approach uses Argonaute-CLIP analysis to design potential siRNA drugs with increased accuracy that can silence SARS-CoV-2, as well as inhibit pulmonary fibrosis in patients. Aptamer-mediated therapeutics Oligonucleotide aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that bind to a specific target. Compared to antibodies, they can be chemically synthesized and modified to have high stability in a cost-effective manner. Aptamers are ideal for targeting ligands so as to impede viral entry and replication, or even further enhance anti-infection effects in infected host cells owing to their high specificity and affinity (Tan et al. , 2022). Several SARS-CoV-2-specific oligonucleotide aptamers have been designed to target the S and N proteins, including those binding to the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein and those targeting trimeric S proteins (Zhang et al. , 2022). Examples of patents that disclose oligonucleotide aptamers for potential use in treating patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are: Patent application CN114410639 (Guangxi University) presents the use of BLI-SELEX technology to identify nucleic acid aptamer APT-S which binds to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and aptamer APT-A which binds to human ACE2. The APT-S aptamer is shown to successfully block interaction between the S protein and ACE2. Patent applications CN113151282 (University of Science and Technology of China) and CN111748558 (Anhui Angpu Tuomai Biotechnology) disclose nucleic acid aptamers that bind to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and their use in treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics52 Cell-based therapeutics As was explained in the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022), cell-based therapies use immune cells (such as regulatory T-cells, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, natural killer cells or dendritic cells) or stem cells (cells able to develop into other cell types) to induce, regulate and/or repair damaged parts of the body impacted by a viral infection. Use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adipose, umbilical cord, bone marrow or dental pulp in treating patients with COVID-19 is the most common strategy being explored, with more than 100 clinical trials underway, as of the end of November 2022 (Zavvar et al. , 2022). While cell-based therapies hold potential promise for treating patients with COVID-19, the practicality of making these cells, alongside cost issues, continues to be an area of concern (Golchin, 2021). Examples of patents that disclose the use of cell-based therapies in treating patients with COVID-19 are: Patent application WO2022204523 (Cellenkos) presents several regulatory T cells derived from cryopreserved human umbilical cord blood that display immunosuppressive abilities. CK0802 cells, which display a CD4+CD25+ phenotype, are disclosed for use in treating ARDS, including in patients with COVID-19. CK0802 cells were tested in patients with lung damage due to COVID-19 (Cellenkos Inc., n.d.). Results showed CK0802 infusions were well-tolerated and improved patient outcomes (Gladstone et al. , 2021). Patent application WO2021155312 (Celularity) discloses killer (NK) cell CYNK-001s derived from human placental CD34+ cells that contain CXCR3 transcripts known to direct NK cells to a viral infection site. The use of CYNK-001 in treating patients with COVID-19 is presented, and its safety and efficacy is to be tested as part of Clinical trial NCT04365101 (Celularity Incorporated, n.d.). Patent application WO2022077115 (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute) discloses MSCs genetically engineered to overexpress angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) and IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins that decrease disease severity and increase survival rate in mouse ARDS models. Specifically, MSC candidates IFITM1-Angpt1 and IFITM3-Angpt1 increased survival rate in virus-induced ARDS. Patent application WO2021222389 (Factor Bioscience) discloses the use of mRNA-based reprogramming to create MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for use in treating infections and ARDS caused by viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. This invention relates that iPSCs contain an increased or decreased expression of those host factors either associated with enhanced antiviral activity or associated with the cytokine storm that occurs in some viral infections. Other biologic-based therapeutics CRISPR-Cas system CRISPR is a gene-targeting system that uses a guide RNA and a nuclease enzyme (such as Cas9, Csm or Cas13d) to cut a gene at a specific location (WIPO, 2022). Its use in targeting highly conserved sequences of SARS-CoV-2, such as the RdRp or N genes, represents a potential new strategy for combating pan-coronaviruses. While this may seem promising, additional studies on potential toxic effects, as well as strategies for lowering overall high production costs, are needed before CRISPR-Cas can be fully utilized in a therapeutic setting (Abusalah et al. , 2022). Examples of patents that begin looking at this new approach are: Patent application WO2021183887 (The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University) presents a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, referred to as prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN), that effectively degrades SARS-CoV-2 RNA and reduces influenza A virus load in human lung cells. Cas13d-PAC-MAN is effective at targeting and cleaving SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with six CRISPR-RNAs found that target more than 90 percent of all coronaviruses. In particular, crRNA PAC-MAN-T6 has been shown to target all known human coronaviruses with a broad coverage that includes other animal coronaviruses (Abbott et al. , 2020). Patent application WO2022132773 (New York Genome Center) discloses that creating chemically-modified CRISPR RNA (crRNA) can improve RNA targeting efficiency and half-life in human cells. This invention shows that Cas13d, along with the chemically modified crRNAs that target a conserved SARS-CoV-2 RNA, could suppress reporter protein expression. This invention also discloses the use of Cas13 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with crRNA for the delivery of Cas13 into human cells via a non-viral mechanism (Mendez-Mancilla et al. , 2022).Highlights of patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics development therapy Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) (30-200 nm in size) that have exceptional ability to target specific tissues or cells. They can therefore serve as good drug delivery vehicles. It has been shown that exosome therapy can overcome the difficulties associated with whole cell-based therapies and help with the regeneration of injured tissue, the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and/or the modulation of immune cells. Exosomes can carry specific therapeutic and/or modulating biomolecules, including bioactive molecules produced in genetically-modified MSCs (Rezabakhsh et al. , 2022). Examples of patents falling into these categories are: Patent application EP3895697 (Ichilov Tech) discloses the preparation of exosome Exo-CD24 which expresses CD24 and its use in reducing the cytokine storm seen in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Exo-CD24 was tested and shown to reduce cytokine levels in treated mice. Several clinical trials sponsored by the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center are evaluating the safety and efficacy of exosomes expressing CD24 in treating patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 (Sprecher, n.d.). Patent application WO2022144333 (Fundacion Para La Investigacion Del Hospital Universitario Y derived from MSCs genetically modified overexpress hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and human telomerase (TERT), and their use in treating diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overexpression of HIF-1 increases the immunomodulatory capacity of secreted EVs. Traditional medicine The practice of traditional medicine in the maintenance of health, as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness, is built upon centuries of theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures (WHO, 2013). Therapies included under the term traditional medicine include those made from herbs, animals or other natural sources. The global response to the pandemic included using medicinal plants and other traditional medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19. Some cultures rely heavily on traditional medicine and some governments actively promoted its use during the pandemic. The Governments of China, India and the Republic of Korea issued guidelines indicating traditional remedies for prevention and treatment of the disease (Ang et al. , 2020; Xiong et al. , 2021). China promoted traditional medicine in the treatment of COVID-19, particularly in areas where access to vaccines and treatments was limited (The Economist, 2022). In Asian cultures more generally, Zingiber officinale (ginger) and species of Glycyrrhiza were frequently used to treat COVID-19 infection (Liana and Phanumartwiwath, 2022). It has been documented that a number of Chinese traditional medicines have been used as a remedy for COVID-19 (Lyu et al. , 2021), with some evidence suggesting positive benefits (Li et al. , 2022; Xing and Liu, 2021). Sales of traditional Chinese medicines by pharmaceutical companies specializing in such products doubled or tripled during the pandemic. Companies selling traditional medicine even outperformed major Western COVID-19 vaccine producers (The Economist, 2022). Asian communities were not alone in their use of traditional medicine. In Peru, medicinal plants were used to both prevent COVID-19 and treat the respiratory symptoms associated with SARS-CoV2-infection (Villena-Tejada et al. , 2021). A number of African medicinal plants show therapeutic potential for COVID-19 (Attah et al. , 2021). Emphasizing the importance of traditional medicine, the World Health Organization signed an agreement with the Government of India in March 2022 establishing a WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM), which will focus on \"evidence and learning; data and analytics; sustainability and equity; and innovation and technology to optimize the contribution of traditional medicine to global health and sustainable development\" (WHO, 2022c). Through September 2022, 523 patent applications related to traditional medicine were published (Figure 16). The vast majority (320) were first filed in 2020. Most were filed by applicants in Asia (86 percent). Only a handful of applicants were located in other regions of the world. Unsurprisingly, a large number of these patent applications (341) were filed with CNIPA in China, where traditional medicine is much more commonly prescribed than in other parts of the world.

Therapeutics for long COVID Similar to what happens with other viral infections, some people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus may experience long-term effects following infection. These long-term effects have generally come to be termed \"long COVID,\" but are also known as post-COVID syndrome, acute post-COVID, long haul COVID and chronic COVID. The World Health Organization defines long COVID as \"the continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation\" (WHO, 2022b). A recent study by Hao Zhang et al. (2022) identified four types of long COVID, each with a different set of symptoms requiring a different therapeutic treatment. Within the dataset, 22 patents were identified that discuss the treatment of long COVID. Table 18 shows the distribution of these patents by therapeutic type. The majority (13, 59 percent) describe the use of small molecule therapeutics to treat symptoms of long COVID. Biologic therapeutics make up the next biggest subset of patents (7, 32 percent), followed by traditional medicine and other types of therapeutics. Highlights of patent filings related to COVID-19 therapeutics development 55 Table 18.

Examples of patents that disclose therapeutics for the treatment of long COVID are: Patent application WO2022006140 (Yale University) discloses the use of camostat or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate of camostat to prevent or reduce the occurrence and consequences of long COVID. Camostat blocks the TMPRSS2 protein. This prevents the virus from fusing with cells and replicating. Patent application US20220280547 (AIM ImmunoTech) discloses the use of Ampligen (Rintatolimid), a dsRNA that acts as a TLR3 agonist which stimulates interferon and necrosis factors, in treating patients with long COVID. In October 2022, Ampligen was given clearance by the USFDA to start a clinical trial treating long COVID (Solve M.E., 2022). Patent application WO2021198346 (Besitzgesellschaft, Nesselhut) discloses the use of human ezrin peptide 1 (HEP1) or an analog to treat COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndrome. HEP1 inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines, amplifies adaptive B cell and T cell immunity and enhances tissue repair. Patent application WO2021188334 (Noveome Biotherapeutics, Inc.) discloses the use of ST266, a novel cell-free platform biologic shown to improve cellular healing, to treat severe systemic inflammatory responses in patients experiencing post-acute COVID-19. Formulations of COVID-19 therapeutics Pharmaceutical formulation is a multistep process during which an active drug is mixed with other components that maximize the therapeutic potential, safety and stability of the final pharmaceutical product (Tovey, 2018). In addition to developing formulations for new drug candidates, researchers also investigated novel formulations of existing drugs, so as to make them easier to administer or enable enhanced pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to efficiently manage and treat diseases, including COVID-19. Through September 2022, 277 patent applications related specifically to pharmaceutical formulations were published. The vast majority (225, 81 percent) were first filed in 2020. Most were filed by corporate applicants (168, 61 percent), either alone or in collaboration with a university or research organization or an independent inventor (Table 19). This speaks to the high commercial interest in pharmaceutical formulations and the marketability of COVID-19 therapeutics (Afrin and Gupta, 2022).

It builds upon and references the first WIPO COVID-19 Patent Landscape Report (WIPO, 2022), which had earlier reviewed patent documents published through until the end of September 2021. This report has covered a variety of new topics. For example, it has discussed patent office strategies adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate patent filings. It has also explored the significant role played by traditional medicine in COVID-19 treatment and prevention, particularly in Asian countries, and the substantial number of COVID-19 therapeutics patents featuring traditional medicine. Other topics discussed are vaccine boosters and treatments for long COVID. The abrupt outbreak and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact worldwide on public health and economies. Such was the impact that it catalyzed an unprecedented effort directed toward the development of vaccines and therapeutics. The development of a vaccine or a therapeutic is ordinarily a complex and slow process taking 10-15 years or longer. Yet, just three years after the pandemic's outbreak, COVID-19 vaccines of different types had either been conditionally or fully approved and deployed in a number of countries. Many things contributed to such remarkable progress, among which were persistent and innovative research over decades, scientific knowledge about the disease being made widely available, intensified collaboration across various organizations, and the policies and measures actioned by governments to facilitate cooperation and vaccine delivery. It is likely that those innovative approaches taken in the development and testing of vaccines and therapeutics during the pandemic will shape how other global health issues are addressed in the future. For example, the method used to test COVID-19 vaccines could become the norm for other types of vaccines. Regulatory agencies may consider granting EUA more frequently for vaccines and treatments for other diseases or disorders. New vaccine development to address the everchanging virus genome itself could be enhanced and/or accelerated, because of what has been learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Philip Robinson et al. (2022) share some interesting thoughts about preparing therapeutics for the next pandemic in order to ensure that the effectiveness acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic is not lost. Some additional factors to consider are the quick dissemination of data, the continued accelerated distribution of viral genomic sequences, secure analysis of patient datasets and the development of a clinical trial system able to be deployed within a matter of days. While the patents reviewed in this report disclose innovative approaches to making and/ or repurposing of vaccines and therapeutics to combat COVID-19, translating this work into substantive clinical success will be a challenge. Most of these patents at the time of writing give little information on the effectiveness of the disclosed substances in humans, instead merely outlining potential clinical trials to be conducted in the future. To determine the effectiveness of these substances one must therefore look to outside organizations that track clinical trials and public data and/or review other scientific literature in order to find out whether the disclosed substance is being tested within a clinical setting and what is the effectiveness. According to the Milken Institute's Vaccine Tracker and the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society Vaccine Tracker, 290 COVID-19 vaccines are currently in clinical trials (including those for EUA or full approval). A total of 13.04 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally, with 4.76 billion people (68.5 percent of the world's population) having received at least one dose (Our World in Data, n.d.). COVID-19 therapeutics are equally critical PerspectivesPatent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics58 in the effort to end this pandemic, even in the presence of vaccines. However, although there have been significantly more patents filed related to the development of COVID-19 therapeutics than to vaccines, to date, success in this area is not as substantial as it has been in vaccine development. Nevertheless, as of June end 2022, a few dozen unique drug candidates had entered Phase 3 (or Phase 2/3) clinical trials, according to analysis by the Milken Institute, the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) COVID-19 tracker data, and the US Clinical trial data (Milken Institute, n.d.-a; RAPS, n.d.-b; U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d.). About a dozen drugs, including both small molecule and antibody drugs, have been approved for use on an emergency basis (RAPS, n.d.-b; USFDA, 2022a). Our earlier analysis of therapeutics in development in 2021 has shown that biologics (especially antibody drugs) and small molecule drug classes each accounted for roughly 50 percent of COVID-19 drugs. However, although virus-neutralizing antibody drugs have had notable clinical success, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 virus variants and subvariants has significantly reduced the effectiveness of those antibody drugs designed to target the viral S protein - the site at which mutations have largely occurred. There is therefore a need for new antibody therapeutics broad in spectrum and/or multivalent and effective against new or predominant variants. The declining clinical success of antibody drugs currently on the market due to viral mutation and resultant insensitivity (Bendix, 2022) has forced clinicians and patients alike to rely on a few small molecule antiviral drugs, such as nirmatrelvir by Pfizer and molnupiravir by Merck & Co, which target coronaviral proteins with fewer mutations than the S protein. Despite their ongoing success, these small molecule drugs have usage limitations, side effects and issues regarding worldwide access. Therefore, it remains a challenge to effectively translate the large volume of patent publications on COVID-19 into substantial clinical success. With the waning virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and a reduction in disease severity observed in the new and currently dominating variants and subvariants, it remains to be seen whether the incentive for drug developers to place large amounts of investment into developing new anti-COVID drugs will continue to be there, especially into those drugs able to cope with the continual mutations of SARS-CoV-2. Technology breakthroughs, such as mRNA vaccine design and lipid nanoparticle technology for mRNA vaccine delivery, have not only profoundly benefited the fight against this pandemic, but may also have enormous potential in vaccine development for other infectious diseases. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies using RNA molecules may advance the treatment of diseases beyond COVID-19. But challenges remain. The rapid mutation of SARS- CoV-2 variants able to evade human immunity warrants expediting the development of new versions of COVID vaccines against newly mutated coronaviruses. The success of mRNA vaccines in this pandemic has offered the world hope that such a goal is indeed achievable. The development of pan SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offering simultaneous protection against multiple variants will enable us to fight this disease more effectively. Despite extensive media discussion, government recommendations and policy debates centering on the availability and use of boosters, patents related to booster vaccines have been shown to comprise a fairly small percentage (5 percent) of the vaccine dataset. Two factors might be impacting this subcategory of patent. First, more patent applications might yet be filed related to vaccine boosters, but only at a future date, once further R&D has been conducted on this topic; a view supported by recent articles in The New England Journal of Medicine discussing the use of monovalent and divalent vaccines as boosters (Winokur et al. , 2023; Lin et al. , 2023). Second, it is possible that patents could have been filed as relating to a booster regimen rather than the booster itself. However, the answer to this question is outside the scope of the data search for this report and therefore not represented in the dataset. In the area of therapeutics, both the incorporation of artificial intelligence and other enabling technologies to quickly identify molecules that might specifically bind to viral target proteins and the development of a mechanism to speed up clinical trials would be highly desirable. Although a number of virus-neutralizing antibodies have shown promising results, with some gaining conditional approval, the expensive and complex drug production process means such drugs are not yet available for every COVID-19 patient. The world is still awaiting further highly efficacious, less expensive and easily administered drugs to become widely available. Perspectives 59 Confronted by these challenges, the high rate of patenting activity related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics revealed in this report, along with an abundance of scientific literature reported in other resources and the unforeseen speed in COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics development, offer hope that pandemics such as this and others can be effectively combated or even prevented in the future. 60 Data sources and methods This report is focused on the analysis of patents related to vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19 from January 2020 through September 2022. A project team was put together consisting of WIPO staff and scientific information specialists from CAS (a division of the American Chemical Society) in order to develop a patent search strategy. Patent information was extracted from the CAS Content Collection (CAS, n.d.-a, n.d.-b), which includes patents published by 97 patent offices around the world up to September 30, 2022. A broad COVID-19 patent dataset was created by searching for patent documents related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, its variants, other novel naming conventions and keyword variations thereof. Two search strategies were then developed for the creation of data subsets related to vaccines and therapeutics. A vaccine dataset was created based on search queries related to vaccine names and the CAS substance registry numbers of those vaccines associated with COVID-19 disease or virus. Moreover, the vaccine dataset incorporated a search for patent classification codes related to medical preparations and variations of prevention and prophylactics. This involved title-abstract and claims search queries using keywords (found in patent documents or assigned to documents by CAS), patent classification symbols, CAS indexing and concept approaches (based on full-text content) and role indicators, such as THU for therapeutic use, PAC for pharmacological activity and PKT for pharmacokinetics, to identify substances with potential as a therapeutic agent. Additionally, a therapeutics dataset identified anti-viral therapeutic records based on search queries of immune-related drug classes, variations of target compounds and therapeutic agent delivery systems. Irrelevant search results were removed by additional search refinements. The search results were further reviewed by both machine models and subject matter experts to remove noise, as well as to cluster patent documents across different vaccine and therapeutic categories. The patent search strategy and the patent datasets (broad COVID-19, vaccines and therapeutics dataset) are available on the WIPO website . Through this process, 8,132 patent families were identified related to COVID-19. Among them, 1,349 related to vaccine development and 5,013 to therapeutics. Various analyses were then performed on the datasets to reveal trends and gain insights. In this report, all record counts and most of the analyses refer to patent families or inventions, unless stated otherwise. Patent families consist of the earliest patent application filed for patent protection, and the subsequent patent applications related to the same invention. Where patents for the same invention are filed in numerous jurisdictions, they are described as patent applications corresponding to the same invention or as members of the same patent family. The filings themselves may claim zero, one or multiple priorities. There are different definitions of patent families. For the purpose of this report, the CAS patent family approach was followed, based on grouping patent documents that share novel scientific content. CAS intellectually evaluates each patent family and will create additional connections (links) to include domestically-related applications, countries that have not ratified the Paris Convention or applications filed too late to claim priority. A combination of technology and human intelligence is used to evaluate each patent family and verify similar content within families. For each patent document, CAS has identified other closely related patent family members that tend to have priority relationships with the representative patents, such as claiming the same priority applications (or same set of priority applications), as well as priorities claimed by this patent and other patent documents that claim priorities to this patent. Patent family members may not have exactly the same priority, but all family members are linked through at least one priority. Continuations-in-part are placed in separate families, AnnexAnnex 61 as are some divisions, depending on whether patent law in the jurisdiction allows new content for these types of filings. While most patent families consist of closely related patents, there are some cases where more than one patent within a patent family is curated separately. This may happen when related patents have somewhat different technical content or when family members have more complex relationships, such as multiple priorities from different countries or relationships resulting from division, continuation or continuation-in-part (CIP) patents. The analysis presented in this report refers to patent families, which in some cases may include a single patent family member. In most graphs and analysis, each patent family is represented by a single patent document. This ensures that even where there are several members of a patent family, it is only counted once - in this way we refer to invention numbers - giving a more accurate picture of actual innovative activity. The analysis of collaborations was performed by normalization of patent applicant names using a combination of technology and human intelligence to obtain a count. Patent applicants, including corporate entities and academic institutions, may file patents with some variation in the institution name. For collaboration analysis, this report focused on corporate entities and universities and research institutes. Independent inventors were omitted from this analysis.

Such efforts start in the research laboratory and typically include a series of clinical trials before the vaccines and therapeutics can be used by the general population. Clinical trials leverage volunteer participants to study new and existing medical interventions like vaccines and therapeutic treatments and evaluate their effects on human health outcomes. They are carefully designed and require the approval of government and public health institutions before they can begin. Clinical trials consist of several phases, each with its own purpose and value as summarized in Figure A4. Figure A4. Clinical trial phases Description of clinical trial phases, including participants and phase purpose or goal. Pre-Clinical Phase 1/I Phase 2/II Phase 3/III Phase 4/IV Laboratory/animal research to determine initial usefulness and safetyEvaluate safety, determine safe dosage range, identify side effectsEvaluate effectiveness and further assess safetyConfirm safety, monitor side effects, compare to other treatmentsDrug is approved and available to consumers. Evaluate long-term effects Source: WIPO, based on World Health Organization information on clinical trials (WHO, n.d.-a). COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics have undergone thousands of clinical trials around the globe, since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Several organizations track these clinical trials, including the WHO (n.d.-d, the Milken Institute (n.d.-a) and RAPS (n.d.-a, n.d.-b). Owing to the global impact of COVID-19 on human health, several broad clinical trials were instituted to gather large amounts of data from participants around the world, so as to identify those therapeutics most useful in combating COVID-19. A few such trials are now discussed in more detail below. The WHO began sponsoring the Solidarity PLUS trial in March 2020. It is a \"large, global randomized trial designed to provide robust results on whether a drug can save lives in those hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19\" (WHO, n.d.-h). This trial is to evaluate several existing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including the antimalaria drug artesunate, the monoclonal interferon beta-1a, and the cancer drug imatinib. Within six months of its start, the study provided conclusive evidence as to the effectiveness of these drugs when repurposed for treating COVID-19. Three of the drugs initially involved in the trial - artesunate, inflizimab and imatinib - showed promising results in the early phase of the study and have progressed for further study. The University of Oxford began its RECOVERY trial in March 2020. \"This international clinical trial aims to identify treatments that may be beneficial for people hospitalized with suspected or confirmed COVID-19\" (University of Oxford, n.d.). This trial is likewise to evaluate several existing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including the antidiabetic drug empagliflozin, the monoclonal antibody the antivirals molnupiravir and Paxlovid. To date, this trial has involved over 47,000 participants across six countries. It has identified four effective COVID-19 treatments, namely, dexamethasone; corticosteroids with tocilizumab; baricitinib; and monoclonal antibodies. The trial is ongoing and continues to evaluate additional treatment options for COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) RECOVER initiative is developing multiple clinical trials to evaluate therapies for ameliorating symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of SARS- CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID. This clinical trial is utilizing a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir antiviral oral medication. The trial is in the final stages of development and approval and expected to begin enrolling participants in early January 2023 (Zimmerman, 2022). In this report, we have outlined patenting activity related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and discussed this in relation to specific types of vaccines and therapeutics. Clinical trial data has been analyzed in the same manner.Annex 65 Analysis of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials According to data contained in the Milken Institute's Vaccine Tracker (Milken Institute, n.d.-a) and the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) Vaccine Tracker, there are 290 vaccines for COVID-19 in clinical trials (RAPS, n.d.-b). Figure A5 shows the distribution of these vaccines by vaccine type. A majority are protein subunit vaccines (96, 33 percent), followed by viral vector (60, 21 percent) and RNA-based vaccines (38, 13 percent), with other types represented in smaller numbers within the dataset. Figure A5. COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials Distribution of 290 COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials by vaccine type. The protein subunit type has the most vaccines in clinical trials.

Table A1 provides a sample listing of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, by vaccine platform type, with the most advanced phase of active clinical trial being reported. The three most commonly used vaccines in the western hemisphere - Moderna's mRNA-1273, Pfizer's Comirnaty and AstraZeneca's AZD1222 - are all in either Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trials. CanSino's Ad5 nCoV vaccine, widely distributed among China's population, has entered a Phase 4 clinical trial. A more in-depth listing of these and the many other vaccines in various clinical trial phases can be found on Milken Institute's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker and the RAPS COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker.Patent Landscape Report: COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics66 Table A1.

Analysis of COVID-19 therapeutics in clinical trials According to data contained in the Milken Institute's COVID-19 Therapeutics Tracker and the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) COVID-19 Therapeutics Tracker, there are 332 therapeutics for COVID-19 in clinical trials. Figure A6 shows the distribution of these therapeutics by therapeutic type. The majority are small molecule therapeutics (163, 49 percent), followed by antibody biologics (95, 29 percent) and cell-based therapies (39, 12 percent), with other types represented in smaller numbers within the dataset.

Most of the therapeutics in clinical trials for use against COVID-19 are repurposed drugs. Two widely discussed examples are molnupiravir and Paxlovid. Molnupiravir was originally developed to treat influenza infection and repurposed to treat COVID-19, because of its ability to inhibit virus replication. Paxlovid is a combination of two antivirals. The first, nirmatrelvir, was developed to specifically treat COVID-19, whereas the second, ritonavir, was initially developed to treat HIV/AIDS before being repurposed to treat COVID-19, owing to its ability to enhance the pharmacokinetic activity of other antiretroviral agents (Clinicalinfo.hiv.gov, n.d.). A more in-depth listing of these and the many other therapeutics in various clinical trial phases can be found on the Milken Institute's COVID-19 Therapeutics Tracker and the RAPS COVID-19 Therapeutics Tracker.
