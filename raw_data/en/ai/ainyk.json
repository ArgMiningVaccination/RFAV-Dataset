Within the remaining two regions with endemic poliomyelitis (African and Eastern Mediterranean), Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pak istan have experienced uninterrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV). Fig. 1-2 show the distribution of WPV and circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases in 2016 -2018. While Afghanistan and Pakistan continuously reported cases in all three years, a WPV case was last reported in Nigeria in August 2016. Fig. 1. Distribution of wild poliovirus cases and circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus cases, worldwide, 2018 Source: WHO . From 2016 to 2018, 17 circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus (cVDPV) post -switch outbreaks of all three serotypes (occurring after the switch from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) in April -May 2016 affected nine countries in four regions . Of the 1 4 circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV 2) outbreaks occurring post -switch, seven were first detected through environmental surveillance (ES). Ensuring polio surveillance reach is sensitive and expansive enough to ide ntify poliovirus circulation in every region and every country is a priority for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and a prerequisite for the global certification of the eradication of poliomyelitis. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 7 Polio surveillance is complicated by the i nability of the GPEI to maintain adequate sensitivity in all countries , especially in regions that have been polio -free for some time. In selected high -risk countries, insecurity and safety issues are key challenges, resulting in pockets of populations per sistently missed by surveillance efforts. Notably, several countries have worked to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance reach into inaccessible areas. Fig. 2 .

To address ongoing challenges, the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan (GPSAP) 2018 -2020 was developed to support countries in evaluating and increasing the sensitivity of their surveillance systems; to share supple mental strategies th at may help close the gaps in detecting polioviruses; to strengthen coordination across surveillance field teams, the laboratory and data information systems; and to leverage activities across functional areas to create a more effective, efficient programm e and document zero cases worldwide. As part of the GPSAP's implementation, the plan reviews disease risk and surveillance performance and prioritizes countries for targeted support. In 2018, 29 priority countries were identified for surveillance strengthe ning per the GPSAP, due to the ongoing or high risk of poliovirus transmission and limited country capacity to adequately address those risks; the prioritization targeted areas in the Eastern Mediterranean and African Regions , the two yet to be certified a s WPV -free, but included outbreak -affected countries in Indonesia Lao People's Democratic Republic (n=3) (n=1) New Guinea (n=40) Somalia (n=13) Syrian Arab Republic (n=74)Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 8 Fig. 3.

Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 9 2 Progress on field polio s urveillance 2.1 Poliovirus surveillance in the Eastern Mediterranean Region 2.1.1 Overview The Eastern Mediterranean Region is one of two WHO regions considered endemic for WPV . During 2016 - 2018, virus transmission was primarily re stricted to two cross -border corridors and one megacity ( Fig. 4 ). The first cross -border transmission corridor links eastern Afghanistan with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, and the second links southern Afghanistan with Quetta division, Balochistan province, Pakistan. The third transmission hotspot during this period was Karachi, Pakistan. Of the 33 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases reported in 2018, 29 came from these three transmission hotspots. In 2018, twelve cases of paralytic poliomyelitis d ue to WPV type 1 were reported in Pakistan, compared to eight cases reported in 2017; in Afghanistan, 21 cases were reported, compared with 14 in 2017. In Afghanistan, the increase in the number of cases reported resulted from persistent pockets of childre n being missed during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in high -risk areas of the southern and eastern regions. In 2018, 10 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region experienc ed either a cVDPV outbreak (Somalia and Pakistan ) or were consider ed high -priority countries per the GPSAP (Djibouti, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan , the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen ). Of the 22 countries in the region, nine countries (Afghanistan, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, So malia, Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic) and one territory ( West Bank and Gaza Strip ) have established ES to detect AFP cases. ES was established in Pakistan in September 2009 and in Afghanistan in 2013. In outbreak countries, it was established in both Somalia and the Syrian Arab Republic in 2017. In other high -risk countries in the region, ES was initiated in Sudan in September 2018; in Jordan and Lebanon, ES was established in 2016 and 2017, respectively, as a direct response to the refugee movement fr om the Syrian Arab Republic. Most countries in 2016 -2018 achieved overall enterovirus (EV) detection (EV rate 50%) annually in at least 50% of ES sites (Fig. 6). Fig. 4.

Environmental surveillance performance ES in Afghanistan and Pakistan has contributed to the understanding of the epidemiology of WPV . As of December 2018, 58 ES sites were operational in Pakistan , a change from 61 sites in 2016 ; the prop ortion Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 13 of sites detecting WPV at least once in any given year was 44% in 2016, 54% in 2017 and 64% in 201 8. In Afghanistan, 20 ES sites were operational as of December 2018 (covering all major urban hubs), an increase from 15 sites in 2016; the proportion of sites detecting WPV at least once in any given year was 13% in 2016, 65% in 2017 and 75% in 201 8. Table 2 shows the number of sites reporting at least one WPV or one vaccine -derived poliovirus ( VDPV ) and the proportion meeting the 50% EV rate benchmark for good -quality ES sites in both countries in 2018.

Enterovirus (EV) = WPV, As part of ensuring that the quality of ES remains high, the Pakistan and Afghanistan programmes review sites in accordance with their National Emergency Action Plan , which requires that all sites be reviewed annually; between 20% and 30% of sites are reviewed on a quarterly basis. In Pakistan, the country team has either closed or shifted the locations of sites that were operational at one time or another over the course of three years . Surveillance issues High population movement between Afghanistan and Pakistan, mainly in the east ern region, affects the GPEI's ability to maintain accurate denominator information, particularly among travel lers within the corridors, nomads, returning refugees and populations that straddle the borders. While surveillance remains generally strong, immunization e fforts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan are focusing on identifying missed children, determining the reasons why they have been missed and implementing operational plans to overcome these challenges. Emphasis continues to be placed on reaching high -risk mobile population groups travelling internally within both countries and across the border. Compared with Pakistan, Afghanistan is not using mobile technologies for active surveillance visits , but security issues may prevent the country from doing so. Surveillance strengthening activities a. Improvements in AFP case detection among high -risk populations In Afghanistan and Pakistan , the surveillance network includes gov ernment and private health facilities, shrines, informal health -care providers (e.g. traditional healers ), community leaders and approximately 35 000 volunteers. Following desk and field reviews in Afghanistan, s ilent districts (no reported AFP cases in a 12 -month period) previously identified in 2017 reported AFP cases in 2018. Mobile populations at high risk in Afghanistan have been mapped and will be tracked through the engagement of nomad elders Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 14 as focal points for surveillance and immunization activities . In a reas where children are inaccessible for immunization activities and the suspicion of virus circulation and pockets of under -immunized children is high , some limited surveillance activities have taken place via local volunteers and community -based surveill ance (CBS) . Quarterly sampling of healthy children takes place in chronically inaccessible areas in the south, south -east and east of Afghanistan . Surveillance performance is also analysed comparing accessible and inaccessible area data , and feedback is ro utinely provided to all staff, to guide intervention . In Pakistan, CBS is strengthened in areas with scattered populations with inadequate access to health facilities, particularly in districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan province. The system br ings on board faith healers, religious clerics, taxi drivers and community health workers who are oriented on AFP and provided contacts to report cases. In 2018, 1452 AFP cases were reported through CBS as compared to 1267 in 2017 across Pakistan. b. Improvem ents in information management To strengthen data collection efforts and streamline processes, regional and provincial teams will be consulted on feasibility, usefulness and workload before introducing any new (or changing existing) data streams or formats . In Pakistan, the use of the open data kit and the Infectious Diseases Management Information System has allowed real -time uploads of zero reports from health facilit ies and reports on active surveillance , further strengthening the monitoring of the AFP s urveillance network. The introduction of the electronic Information for Action online platforms allows real -time uploading of all information on AFP cases and ease s data analysis at the national and sub national levels. 2.1.3 Outbreak and other high -risk countr ies AFP surveillance performance In 2018 , 10 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region experienc ed either a cVDPV outbreak (Somalia and Pakistan ) or were considered high -priority countries per the GPSAP (Djibo uti, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen). During 2016 -2018 , high -risk countries such as Iraq, Libya and Yemen consistently achieved NPAFP rates exceeding the global standard; AFP cases reported in Iraq increased in 2018 (n=102 3) compared with 699 cases in 2017 .

Environmental surveillance performance ES in high -priority or outbreak countries has played a critical role in monitoring cVDPV2 transmission and Sabin -like type 2 virus isolation from the monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine responses in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Table 4 shows the number of sites reporting at least one WPV or one VDPV among outbreak or high -risk countries and the proportion meeting the 50% EV rate benchmark for good -quality ES sites in 2018 . To ensure the quality of ES remain s high, programmes continue to actively review and manage their ES network. In Somalia, the country team has closed one site and identified a new site location further upstream targeting the same catchment population. Furthermore, in 2018, Somalia undertoo k an effort to map existing ES sites in Mogadishu and to identify potential new ES sites in Hargeisa, Garowe, Baidoa and Kismayo , but no suitable additional sit es have been identified so far.

Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 16 Surveillance issues Areas that are difficult or impossible to access represent s ignificant s urveillance challenges in t his region . Conflict s within countries have prevented or hindered surveillance efforts, either through lack of access or through population movement (effectively blinding the polio program me to the true situation in some areas) . For example, d ue to insecur ity and conflict, delays in the transportation of specimens within and outside of Yemen have resulted in a large number of AFP cases pending final classification for more than 90 days . Efforts have been made to mitigate these transport challenges ; however , downstream the backlog of specimens has affected laboratory processing timeliness and completion . Despite these challenges, Yemen has achieved a national NPAFP rate of less than 5 per 100 000 and a stool adequacy rate of greater than 90% during 2016 -2018. Furthermore, the expansion of ES to Yemen and Libya is still of interest despite ongoing issues of insecurity that have thus far hindered efforts. Among other high -risk countries in the region, Djibouti did not report any AFP cases between April 2017 and December 2018 . Survei llance strengthening activities a. Improve ment s in AFP case detection To strengthen the country's surveillance network, t he Somalia polio program me conducted an audit and prioritization of health facilities . Active surveillance was rein itiated in these facilities, a s well as within the community , including the collect ion of community samples in silent areas, and among hot cases (priority cases of AFP that are more likely than other cases to be true polio ). Approximately 80% of the 9 33 ac tive AFP reporting sites across Somalia are health facilities operated by partners ( nongovernmental organizations and private institutions). To boost the search for AFP cases, efforts to map all AFP cases with geocodes are under way (the target for geocodi ng is 100% of AFP cases); furthermore, the zero -reporting system was assessed in 2018 and is being revamped by the programme in 2019. CBS was established in Raqqa and Deir Ez -Zor governorates in the Syrian Arab Republic in January 2018 , comprising more tha n 400 community informants , and it has been used for disease reporting in emergencies th rough the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN). In Somalia , approximately 535 village polio volunteers support the polio programme , most of which are locate d in inaccessible areas. While efforts have improved case detection in hard -to-reach areas, approximately 544 820 children aged under 15 years continue to be inaccessible in areas that lack village polio volunteers , which poses a risk of missing circulatio n. Investigations into reasons for the non-reporting of AFP in silent districts (in 2018) were completed in Somalia. b. Improvement s in program me accountability through electronic data collection The Somalia program me developed a mobile reporting applicatio n using Open Data Kit s in 1168 (68%) of 1726 ac cessible areas , to track active surveillance and monitoring activities at health facilities in real time. c. Improve ment s in AFP surveillance strengthening in high -risk populations To understand the risk posed b y high -risk populations, the Somalia programme has undertaken efforts to strengthen surveillance in high -risk populations using a standardized classification and definition system , including : mapping internally displaced population ( IDP) camps Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 17 appointing focal persons for AFP surveillance in each IDP camp mapping extensive settlement s, including along international borders with Kenya and Ethiopia to identify areas of population movement and potential pockets of missed settlements for surveillance and immuni zation . Furthermore , in 2018, a survey of healthy children in Somalia yielded 426 samples, among which approximately 55% originated from in accessible areas; t wo specimens yielded VDPV. d. Surveillance in high -risk and under -performing areas The use of log tag s to assess the quality of the reverse cold chain and to better understand stool temperatures during transportation was implemented in Yemen, Sudan and Somalia . An important component to strengthen surveillance activities lies in the regular and s ystemati c analysis of data. While Lebanon, Jordan and Libya routinely analyse surveillance data by location, gender and oral polio vaccine ( OPV )/inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV) status, in Somalia , Iraq, Sudan and Yemen, surveillance data are also routinely analyse d by accessibility and lifestyle ( e.g. nomadic, urban, rural) . e. Other activities to enhance surveillance See Annex 4. Reviews of surveillance performance ) and Annex 5. Training s and sensitization s) for additional information . Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 18 2.2 Poliovirus surveillance in the African Region 2.2.1 Overview The African Region is one of two WHO regions considered endemic for WPV ; the last case of poliomyelitis due to WPV type 1 was reported in Nigeria on 21 August 2016 . No new evidence of circulation of WPV from any source has been observed since the detection of virus in a healthy child from Borno State on 27 September 2016. From 2016 to 2018 , outbreaks of cVDPVs have affected Nigeria as well as the D emocratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya and Ethiopia ; Ethiopia had no cases of cVDPV but was included in outbreak response activities . At the national level, surveillance indicators have generally met global standards, however challenges still remain at th e subnational level (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Surveillance performance ( non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [a] and stool adequacy [b]) among endemic, outbreak and high -risk countries - African Region , 2016 -2018 (Fig. 8a) (Fig. 8b) Source : WHO. As of December 2018, ES was operational in 23 countries in the region with 250 sites located in 249 districts , compared to 12 countries with 203 sites in 103 districts in 2016. In 2018, the African Regional Environmental Surveillance Working Group was created to assist i n strengthening ES implementation in Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 19 the region, monitor ES quality through on -site assessments and develop a regional ES workplan. The group conducted on -site visits to nine of the 23 countries with ES in 2018, resulting in the closure of sites with poor performance, the initiation of new sites and recommend ations for operational improvements to supervision, and specimen collection and financing. Improvements in virus (i.e. EV) yield was seen in some countries . Fig. 9 shows the proportion of countries with ES sites that achieved at least a 50% EV rate (isolation of any poliovirus ) by country. Of the 2 3 countries with ES, 12 have maintained high -quality ES sites. While sites in Angola maintai ned an EV detection rate of 50% in 2018, the rate declined from 88% in 2017 . Fig. 9. Overall enterovirus detection among environmental surveillance sites by country - African Region, 2016 -2018 Enterovirus (EV) = 2.2.2 Endemic countries: Nigeria AFP surveillance performance Nigeria is one of three countries worldwide that ha d not interrupted WPV circulation by 2018 . After a period of two years without reported WPV, four cases were reported in the north -eastern state of Borno, an area that has been severely affected by insurgency -related insecurity. During 2016 -2018, key surveillance enhancement activities were implemen ted, including the expansion of active surveillance sites , use of new surveillance technology, community informants from inaccessible areas, auto -visual AFP detection and reporting (AVADAR), several special interventions coupled with surveillance resulting in significant i mprovements in AFP surveillance. AFP surveillance performance indicators were met by all provinces/ states (Table 5). Declines in AFP case detection , NPAFP rates and stool adequacy rates were noted (although an external review of outbreak r esponse activities attributed the decline in surveillance quality; achieved by the systematic AFP verification by trained verifiers , biannual surveillance \"peer reviews\" of AFP cases for states with very high surveillance core indicators .

During 2016 -2018, the numb er of non -reporting local government areas ( LGAs ) and wards in Borno S tate decreased and fewer AFP cases were missed (Fig. 10) . Furthermore, data analyses improved by mapping areas with accessibility challenges and grouping areas by operational cluster of epidemiologic relevance. Fig. 10. Non -reporting local government area s (a) and wards (b) for acute flaccid paralysis surveillance \u2014 Borno state, 2016 -2018 (Fig. 10 a) (Fig. 10 b) Source : Borno emergency operations centre . Environmental surveill ance performance ES was initiated in 2011 in Kano State, Nigeria . Following implementation in additional states , silent WPV transmission was confirmed in Lagos , Sokoto and Kaduna (poliovirus was detected from sewage specimens collected from ES in the absen ce of detection of any cases in humans) . By the end of 201 8, ES was conducted in 21 states in Nigeria , with a total of 103 sampling sites , nine of which were located in Borno S tate (Table 6) . By end of December 2018 , two ES laboratories serve the country ; one located in Ibadan and a second in Maiduguri conducting parallel testing . No WPV has been detected in ES. As part of ensuring that the quality of ES remains high, the programme continues to actively review and manage the ES network. In Nigeria, the coun try team has either closed or shifted the locations of ES sites that were operational at one time or another over the last three years. The main challenges encountered in selecting ES sites have been the absence of well -designed closed sewage systems in m any of the highest priority states. Security challenges exist in the north -east zone that threatens safe sample collection and transportation. Reliance on erratic public transportation to get the samples to the Ibadan laboratory with delayed delivery, and a fragile infrastructure cause d by power outages that threaten the capacity to keep samples cold. The lack of local environmental protection legislation allows local industry to pollute drainage channels and sampling sites with chemical effluent Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 22 discharges , and water flow is blocked by refuse, road construction activities, irrigation and mining activities. Table 6. Environmental surveillance performance in Nigeria (districts) \u2014 African Region , 2018 Surveillance issues While extensive efforts have improved surveillance reach in Borno State, t he volatile security situation has prevented both routine immunization and SI As from reaching unsafe areas. The lack of access and inability to conduct high -quality surveillance remain in some areas of Borno State and continue to challenge the polio programme . Surveillance strengthening activities Following confirmation of WPV in 2016, Borno State and partners commenced a host of innovative strategies to enhance AFP detection , including intensified AFP case search by house -to-house teams during immunization plus days and s ystematic contact sampling of all AFP cases reported. Of the 732 AFP cases reported in Borno State in 2018, 127 (17.3%) were from inaccessible areas thanks to the efforts of community informants from inaccessible areas. a. Surveillance improvements in inaccessible or security -compromised settlements Community informan ts from inaccessible settlements use their \"circle\" of influence to engage others with regular contact in secure areas and link them with LGA community informant focal persons. Informants include persons such as hunters, drive rs, fishermen and informal health-care providers. In 2018, 127 (17.3 %) of the 7 32 AFP cases reported in Borno State came from security compromised areas, including six cases from the Lake Chad islands. About half of all cVDPV2 AFP cases detected in Borno State were reported by communit y informants from inaccessible settlements (Fig. 11) . Furthermore, use of electronic tools to facilitate identification and investigation of AFP cases and AVADAR and e -Surv were successfully introduced; additional information can be found in the next sect ion. During routine immunization activity strategies, such as Reaching Every Settlement (RES) and Reaching Inaccessible Children (RIC), all personnel are engaged and trained on AFP surveillance. A focal person is responsible for searching for AFP cases, s ensitizing households on AFP identification and reporting, identifying community informants and, where applicable, collecting stool samples from healthy children. For any AFP case identified, the index case and three contacts are evacuated to safe areas to complete the case investigation. Hard -to-reach mobile teams provide key health services in underserved populations across Borno state, such as routine immunization, the treatment of minor ailments, antenatal services, and surveillance for AFP and other pr iority diseases. All personnel are trained regularly on AFP surveillance.

Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 23 session plans have been integrated with strategies for engaging informants from insecure areas, by providing services at strategic locations for persons from insecure a reas seeking services in secure areas. Currently, 58 hard -to-reach mobile health teams cover 1621 settlements in 25 LGAs; from 2016 to 2018, for each year, respectively, 6%, 8.5% and 5% of all AFP cases were reported by hard -to-reach mobile teams in Borno state. Fig. 11. Community -based surveillance and accessibility \u2014 Borno state, 2016 -2018 Source : Borno emergency operations centre team analysis . b. AFP surveillance in IDPs camp s Internally displaced persons represent the highest -risk population for poliov irus transmission. The last four cases of WPV reported in Nigeria were in IDPs. In Borno, IDP camp clinics are considered the highest priority for AFP surveillance and undergo at least two active surveillance visits per week. All clinics in IDP camps have been incorporated into the disease surveillance network with a designated surveillance focal person . During 2016 -2018, over 100 A FP cases were reported each year among IDPs. Based on this experience in Nigeria a fourth level of prioritization of surveillan ce sites (highest priority) has been adopted in the Africa Region). c. AFP surveillance supported by special i ntervention teams Following the WPV outbreak in 2016, special intervention teams were deployed across the state to engage in specific strategies and at strategic locations to target special or underserved populations with OPV across Borno state . All personnel were trained on AFP surveillance and each team had a designated focal person primarily respons ible for AFP surveillance. In 2018, 16 AFP cases were reported by s pecial intervention teams , compared to 14 cases in 2017 . d. Improvements in community informant performance A system to track zero reports from community informants was introduced to remind them to search and report the status of AFP in their community , including zero report s. The supervision of informants is the collective responsibility of all surveillance personnel in Borno State . All informants in the state are mapped to a specific supervisor using a standard template , and s upportive superv ision is conducted by field Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 24 volunteers using checklist s. Supervisory findings are documented in a Zero Report b ooklet or Call Logs booklet with the weekly submission of active case search data (including zero report s). In the fourth quarter of 2018, 92% of community informants' reports were received. e. Identification of community circulation among high -risk and mobile populations Four strategies for health y child ren stool sampling are implemented in Borno state : 1. Healthy children stool sampling from inaccessib le areas: collecting stool samples from healthy children and their contacts from these areas . 2. Healthy c hildren s tool sampling from new arrivals in IDPs: collecting one stool specimen each from 10% of children aged under 10 years in a cluster of IDPs within seven days of their arrival in a secure area. 3. Nomadic healthy children stool sampling : collecting one stool specimen from a maximum of five nomadic children age d under 10 years in a group of nomads within seven days of their arrival in an LGA. No addition al specimen s are collected as long as they stay in the LGA , even if they change location s within it. 4. Healthy children stool sampling in RES/RIC strategies : Sampling in RES - collecti ng one stool specimen each from a maximum of five children aged under 10 years in an AFP non -reporting w ard implementing RES. No additional specimen s are collected once the maximum number of five specimen s is reached , even if additional RES rounds are implemented in the ward ; Sampling i n RIC - target ing three healthy children sto ol specimens per settlement implementing RIC ( not yet implemented ). In 2018, 723 stool samples were collected and tested from healthy children. f. Enhance ment of environmental surveillance To enhance routine ES in Borno state, the number of routine ES sites was expanded during 2016 -2018 , with increased frequency of specimen collection . In 2017 and 2018 , two ES sweeps were conducted in security compromised areas . They involve d a one-time collection of 1 litre of wastewater contaminated by sewage from each vali dated ES sweep site located in security compromised LGAs . In addition, ad hoc ES with monthly specimen collection was implemented for six months (Jan uary to June 2018) in relatively secure areas of Borno State where routine ES was not implemented . 2.2.3 Outbre ak and other high -risk countries AFP surveillance performance During 2016 -2018 , 17 countries in t he African Region experienc ed either a cVDPV outbreak (Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger and Nigeria ) or were considered high priority for surveillance strengthening ( Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic , Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Guinea -Bissau, Liberia, Mali , Sierra Leone and South Sudan ). Subnational AFP indicators remain ed concerning in some areas , with pocke ts of inaccessibility affecting surveillance efforts throughout the region .

Environmental surveillance performance ES in outbreak or high -risk countries has played a critical role in complementing traditional AFP surveillance and monitoring poliovirus transmission in the African Region. As of December 2018, 15 of the 18 outbreak or high -risk countries in the region had implemented ES. During 2016 -2018, VDPV was detected from sewage in Nigeria and Kenya . In Nigeria, the proportion of sites detecting VDPV at least once in any given year increased from 2% in 2016 to 23% in 2018 . In Kenya , 11% of sites detected VDPV at least once in 2018 . Table 8 shows the number of sites reporting at least one WPV or one VDPV and the proportion meeting the 50% EV rate benchmark for good -quality sites in 2018.

Enterovirus (EV) = WPV, : WHO. As part of ensuring that the quality of ES remains high, programmes continue to actively review and manage their ES network. In Kenya, the country team has either closed or shifted the locations of two sites that were operational at one time or another over the course of three years. Recommendations from external reviews of ES sites in both Ethiopia and Kenya in 2018 focused on improving site performance and expan ding ES to high -risk areas in response to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak . By December 2018, Kenya successfully initiated ES in eight new sites , effectively increasing the ir number from nine to 17. In 2018, as part of the ongoing assessmen t of ES sites in Cote D'Ivoire, the country programme closed eight sites , resulting in seven active sites as of 31 December 2018. Surveillance issues Several issues impacting surveillance exist in the region. As in other regions where inaccessibility due t o conflict persists, many challenges likewise exist due to difficulty in reaching remote areas or adequately identifying high -risk populations. While strong efforts are being made to improve the supervision of surveillance activities through the use of ele ctronic innovations and engagement with organizations uniquely able to access select areas, the adequate supervision of surveillance activities continues to be a challenge , including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , South Sudan and in some north -eastern counties of Kenya. Community members, non-local health workers and other public service employees Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 27 continue to flee area s following attacks in some areas close to the border with Somalia and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo . Due to intense pop ulation movement across many countries, a further challenge is in estimating population denominators . Additional expansion of ES in the region is expected in 2019, but lengthy administrative and implementation processes can hinder rapid progress. Furtherm ore, as ES expands in the region, ensuring adequate laboratory space and human resource capacity to process enviro nmental specimens is critical. Surveillance strengthening activities a. Improve ments in AFP case detection To strengthen the surveillance netwo rk in outbreak -affected provinces, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other country polio program mes conducted an audit and prioritization of health facilities ; all surveillance sites are reviewed twice a year. E -surv using electronic systems was ini tiated in the province of Kinshasa (DRC) since 2017 in which all 35 health zones are conducting active searches for AFP cases. Updating of surveillance sites every six months has been streamlined in the Africa Region with the addition of a fourth level of site priority known as \"highest\" where facilities are visited at least twice weekly . b. Improvements in program me accountability through electronic data collection The African Region has implemented eSurv , a mobile reporting application , to track active su rveillance and monitoring activities at health facilities in real time . While many countries in the region have started using eSurv, including Ethiopia, Kenya and South Sudan, inconsistency in performance has been noted, such as the lack of active surveill ance visits in high -priority sites. In 2017, the WHO Regional Director for Africa required all WHO country offices to implement the integrated supportive supervision (ISS) mobile application. ISS is a similar tool to eSurv but includes assessment s of rout ine immunization and cold chain as well as vaccine preventable diseases (AFP, Measles, Yellow Fever, and Neonatal Tetanus) . The purpose of ISS is to monitor the overall immunization system at a local level whereas eSurv focuses on AFP surveillance. c. Improv ements in surveillance in border areas Several cross -border activities have been conducted in the Lake Chad Basin countries and for other countries during SIAs. Ethiopia and Kenya, through a partnership with the CORE Group Polio Project, strengthened surv eillance in communities that share a border with Somalia. Likewise, CORE Group contributed to strengthening surveillance in South Sudan . d. Improve ments in surveillance in high -risk and under -performing areas The innovative technology AVADAR (Auto -visual AFP detection and reporting ) is an electronic application that has enhance d community reporting by: provi ding informants in high risk areas with smart phones to report AFP cases ensuring the availability of real-time data at the subnational level in areas wher e surveillance is weak tracking the geographical coverage of the network of informants and case distribution through geographic information system (GIS) mapping . Community members are trained to detect and report potential AFP cases , and GIS features in th e application allow the programme to geolocate a potential AFP case and the subsequent investigation. This requires cellular network. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 28 As of 2018, AVADAR has been implemented in 30 states or provinces, and 95 districts in 10 countries in the African Region (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria (Borno state), Sierra Leone and South Sudan ), (Fig. 12) . The estimated population aged under 15 years covered by AVADAR is 9.5 million children. Fig. 12. Co untries with AVADAR implementation in select provinces or districts - African Region, 2018 Source : WHO. Following AVADAR introduction, documented evidence from January 2017 to October 2018 show ed a 42% increase in AFP detection among all countr ies and a 58% reductio n in non -reporting health areas . It also show ed that 98% of trained community informants were actively reporting . In 2018, 552 true AFP cases were reported via the traditional system compared with 1102 true AFP cases reported through AVADAR. Initial assessment of AVADAR performance ha s been positive ; however, a full evaluation of AVADAR data quality was planned for all implementing countries during 2019. e. Surveillance support for high -risk settings In April 2018, the region mobilized GPEI funds to support key surveillance activities in select countries at high risk of WPV importation and VDPV emergence, or based on declining performance indicators or concerns for surveillance blind spots. Eleven countries were selected for surveillanc e reinforcement through the Surveillance Strengthening Initiative , and in 2018 GPEI partners provided on-site technical support to Burundi, the Central African Republic , Guinea -Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Niger ; remote support was provid ed to Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea and Mali. Due to delayed implementation , particularly concerning the hiring and procurement of equipment, some activities were carried over into 2019 for completion. Notabl y, all activities related to the engagement of human resources were completed by the end of 2018. The technical assistance and funds provided for operation al activities significantly contributed to the improvement in surveillance indicators particularly in Guinea - Bissau and Equatorial Guinea. f. Improve ments in the selection of environmental surveillance sites Catchment populations for ES sites can be difficult to quantify in settings that lack a sewer network and must rely on other systems for wastewater flow, such as open canals or water channels. A set of tools has been developed to help streamline the processes to identify areas where potential candidate sites could Borno State, Nigeria Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 29 be considered . It incorporates GIS technology, hydrology, digital elevation models, population estimates, \"blue line\" data (synthetic, d igital streams and waterways generated by determining flow direction and accumulation) and the exact location and details of potential and existing environmental sites using a smartphone application with detailed GPS location. Since 2013, this tool has bee n used in Nigeria , resulting in the development of a polio ES site map catalogue, containing over 30 maps and 94 sites. To date, data for 691 ES sites located in 15 countries are available in the E nvironmental Surveillance Site Catalogue (https://www.es.world/#!/catalog ). As part of the planned expansion of ES within the African Region, the WHO Regional Office for Africa is planning to leverage these tools and processes and adapt them for other countries starting in 2019. g. Other activities to enhance surveillance See Annex 4 (Reviews of surveillance performance) and Annex 5 (Trainings and sensitizations) for further information. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 30 2.3 Polio virus surveillance in the Western Pacific Region 2.3.1 Overview AFP surveill ance was established in the Western Pacific Region in 1992 , following regional certification of polio -free status in 2000 . AFP surveillance has been maintained as the platform to monitor measles, neonatal tetanus and other vaccine -preventable disease s in t he region . While polio surveillance remains in place in the majority of W estern Pacific Region countries, variability exists among them based on the reporting and investigation of AFP cases. AFP case n otification is primarily the responsibility of practiti oners or key physicians ( i.e. paediatricians) in countries such as Australia, Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand and Singapore . AFP surveillance in large metro politan areas (e.g. Seoul) is supplemented by sentinel hospital case reporting and national EV surveillan ce (e.g. Republic of Korea) . In Japan, v irologic surveillance for EVs including polio is the primary surveillance source . Finally, a ctive, hospital -based AFP surveillance continues in Pacific island countries . In November 2018, all countries in the Western Pacific Region conducted national -level polio risk assessments; select countries conducted polio risk assessments at the subnational level. In 2018, an outbreak of cVDPV type 1 was detected in Papua New Guinea . Six countries in the Western Pacific Region conduct ES: Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea . The site in Australia was temporarily suspended due to the outbreak in Papua New Guinea and lab capacity considerations. Regional ES challenges have been associated with a lac k of standardized reporting format and of consistent reporting among countries. 2.3.2 Outbreak and other high -risk countries AFP surveillance performance In response, the Papua New Guinea polio program me developed and distributed guidelines for enhanced surveill ance (including the initiation of active surveillance and guidance on stool collection and transportation) and elaborated a comprehensive AFP surveillance training package for the country . AFP case detection subsequently increased in Papua New Guinea, with one reported case of NPAFP in 2016 , compared with 284 reported cases (NPAFP rate 7.9 per 100 000 children aged under 15 years ) in 2018 (Table 9).

Environmental surveillance Papua New Guinea is the fourth country in the West ern Pacific Region to establish environmental surveillance . As of December 2018, Papua New Guinea had five ES sites located in two cities - Port More sby and Lae. The presence of cVDPV was detected in seven of the first 27 specimens collected after the initiation of ES in Papua New Guinea , from three different ES sites. Challenges in the collection of ES samples in the country have been due to transportation issues, stock -outs of supplies and inclement weather . Surveillance issues Geographically hard -to-reac h areas and security issues played a role in limiting timely investigations and stool specimen transport in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia . For example, in Papua New Guinea , genetic sequencing suggested virus circulation approximately one year prior to det ection. Surveillance strengthening activities In Papua New Guinea , high -level government commitment , including the activation of national and provincial emergency operations centres , and strong human resource support from GPEI partners built capacity in the country to quickly respond to the cVDPV outbreak. Specifically, AFP surveillance training for provincial - and district -level health -care workers and a revitalization of the polio expert review committee took place . Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 32 2.4 Polio virus surveillance in the Sout h-East Asia Region 2.4.1 Overview The WHO South -East Asia Region reported the last WPV case from India on 13 January 2011 and the region was certified polio -free on 27 March 2014. The overall NPAFP rate in the region in 2018 was 7.5 per 100 000 population aged under 15 years , which exceeds the globally recommended operational target of 2 per 100 000 (Fig. 13 a). In 2018, the timeliness of stool specimen collect ion among reported AFP cases in the region exceeded the global recommended target of at least 80% (Fig. 1 3b). Fig. 13.

Data as of 01 July 2019 The South -East Asia Region polio laboratory network is c omposed of 16 laboratories in seven countries (Bangladesh, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand) and includes one global specialized laboratory and two regional reference laboratories. In addition, to enhance ES, three sewage concentration laboratories were established : two in India (Hyderabad, Patna) and one in Nepal. The concentrated samples are shipped to polio laboratories in Mumbai and Thailand, respectively. The network tested over 78 000 stool s pecimens in 2018 and the timeliness of reporting primary culture results within two weeks of sample receipt was 97.7% (exceeding the global requirement of 80%). Environmental sampling is conducted in six countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand ), many of which host large migrant populations.

Following the successful efforts to strengthen surveillance, a new emergenc e of VDPV1 was detected in a child from Papua province (Table 10) with paralysis onset in November 2018 and no history of past polio vaccination. Intensified surveillance and response activities were still in progress in December 2018. Table 10.

Surveillance strengthening activities The re-sensitization and training of district -level surveillan ce officers of Papua province were completed . Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 34 2.5 Polio virus surveillance in the Region of the Americas 2.5.1 Overview In 1994, the WHO Region of the Americas was certified polio -free by the International Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradicati on from the Americas , with the last endemic case of WPV type 3 occurring in October 1990 in Mexico . In the last five years, three immunodeficiency -associated vaccine - derived poliovirus ( iVDPV ) cases have been notified in the region : two from Argentina and one from Colombia. In addition, the Pan American Health Organization is planning to set up a working group to discuss how the recently published recommendations on implementing poliovirus surveillance in patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) could be adapted for the Americas. 2.5.2 Surveillance performance summary AFP surveillance standard indicators are monitored by country and published on a weekly basis since 1987. As part of the global certification process, since 2018 every country in the r egion is required to submit an Annual Report on the Documentation of Polio Eradication Status to the Global Certification Commission to confirm that they remain free from WPV. In 2018, only six countries met all key AFP surveillance indicators for NPAFP de tection, stool adequacy and timeliness (Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay). However, the quality of AFP surveillance has not been maintained and, in the last 52 weeks, only Mexico and Nicaragua have met all three key indicators. To supp lement AFP surveillance, the region has implemented ES in Haiti and Guatemala. In Haiti, ES started in 2016 and as of 2018 is conducted in four communes with a total of eight collection sites. In Guatemala, ES started in November 2018, in two districts wit h three collection sites each. 2.6 Polio surveillance in the European Region 2.6.1 Overview Certification of the WHO European Region occurred in June 2002. Member States are encouraged to provide polio surveillance data from primary sources : AFP surveillance, ES and enterovirus surveillance. 2.6.2 Surveillance performance summary Given the broad heterogeneity of countries in the region , many of which do not conduct AFP surveillance, the Regional Office for Europe has strongly encouraged the collection of detailed supple mentary surveillance data in the form of ES and EV surveillance information. As of 2018, 12 countries conduct AFP surveillance alone, 30 conduct AFP surveillance and supplementary surveillance, 10 conduct supplementary surveillance alone, and one country c onducts no polio surveillance. Supplementary surveillance used in the region has had a high probability of detecting polioviruses in the target population but may not be sensitive enough to identify the i ndex case or initial excretor. One challenge facing the region is that most of the data are generated through the laboratories ; there is a lack of available epidemiological data from EV and ES systems, particularly for systems that are not directly under the authority of the health ministries . Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 35 3 Progress on the expan sion of the environmental surveillance network 3.1 Overview Environmental surveillance for poliovirus is the routine collection and testing of environmental (sewage) specimen s from designated locations draining large target populations. Environmental surveillance ( ES) supplements AFP surveillance by providing information on the presence and spatial scale of poliovirus transmission. 3.2 Environmental expansion progress In 2013 , the Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013 -2018 (PEESP) proposed a mod est expansion of ES in recognition of its increasing value in detecti ng poliovirus transmission. At that time , ES existed in a small number of countries funded by the GPEI: Afghanistan, Angola, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan. Other countries also had ES with technical support from the GPEI or were wholly self -funded . In April 2015 , the global Polio Environmental Surveillance Expansion Plan (PESEP) was published under the PEESP and framed expansion in two phases: Phase 1: to monitor both the effectiveness of e radicating WPVs and the emergence and circulation of VDPVs prior to OPV type 2 withdrawal. Phase 2: to monitor the effectiveness of poliovirus containment in essential poliovirus laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities. During 2015 -2016, new co untries that implemented ES were Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad and Niger and, in relation to outbreaks , Guinea and Madagascar. Senegal also commenced during this period. Within the endemic countries ( Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan) the number of sites al so increased . However, not all countries targeted in phase 1 of the plan implemented ES. Because of concerns about the possible negative effects of undetected cVDPV2 transmission , 34 countries in four WHO regions (the Western Pacific , South -East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and A frican Regions ) were prioritized for phase 2 expansion between 2017 and 2019 and were categorized by risk or regional priority . As of December 2018, 22 o f the 34 countries in the phase 2 plan have commenced ES , nine are pending implementation and three have discontinued ES. Among the se countries, 117 new sites have been added . 3.3 Regional priorities and outbreak countries In addition to the targeted phase 2 planned expansion, 39 sites have been added in six additional countries that started ES during 2017 -2018, either due to regional priority ( Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti and Thailand) or outbreaks (Mozambique and Zambia as the neighbo ur of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ).

Status of environmental surveillance \u2014 Africa n Region , Eastern Mediterranean Region , South -East Asia Region and W estern Pacific Region , 2018 Source: WHO. 3.4 Quali ty and sensitivity of existing environmental surveillance network Considerations for expanding ES must balance resource commitments between AFP surveillance and ES in light of the significant implications for both field and laboratory activities. Expanding ES, particularly to countries without Global Polio Laboratory Network ( GPLN ) facilities or those facing security issues , presents serious challenges for the surveillance system. The programme depends on both detailed technical information and local knowledge to identify promising sites. Efforts to develop practical guidance for selecting sites, opening and closing them , and monitoring contin ue. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 37 4 Surveillance to detect polioviruses among patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders 4.1 Overview Individuals with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs), especially those with disorders affecting the B-cell system, are at increased risk of pr olonged replication and excretion of polioviruses and the development of paralytic illness. Continuous replication of the attenuated viruses from OPV increases the risk of vaccine viruses mutating and reacquiring neurovirulence and transmission characteris tics similar to WPV. When this occurs , the resultant poliovirus is referred to as iVDPV. This poses an individual risk through the development of paralytic illness among PID patients. There is also a broader risk of establishing community transmission that could seed a polio outbreak in areas with low population immunity ; to date no community -wide transmission of iVDPV has been detected . However, the risk of community spread of iVDPVs may change with the reduction of population immunity expected after WPV eradication and the improvement in health care enabling PID patients to survive longer in lower resource settings. 4.2 Current iVDPV case reporting The WHO maintains a registry of immunodeficient persons known to excrete iVDPV. Prolonged excretion is defined a s the presence of iVDPV in stool specimens for more than six months and less than five years; chronic excretion is the presence of iVDPV in stools for five years or more . From 1962 to 2018, 133 PID patients with prolonged/chronic excretion of poliovirus were reported and recorded in the WHO registry. A shift in prevalence of reported cases from high -income countries to middle - and lower -income countries was detected after 2000 , though it was in part due to the adoption of IPV in high -income countries and improvement in the survival of PID patients in OPV -using middle -income countries. Among the 29 PID patients excreting poliovirus identified between 2016 and 2018 , 79% were prolonged excret ers, 31% excreted poliovirus type 2, and the most common PID associated with poliovirus excretion was sev ere combined immune deficiency . During 2016 -2018, 29 iVDPV cases were reported : nine in 2016, nine in 2017 and 11 in 2018. Table 11.

PID: primary immunodeficiency disorders; iVDPV: Immunodeficiency -associated vaccine - derived poliovi rus Source : WHO. 4.3 Progress on primary immunodeficiency disorders surveillance guidance and implementation To mitigate the individual and community risks posed by iVDPVs during the polio endgame and the post - eradication era, it is important to identify tho se PID patients excreting polioviruses and provide the strategies and treatments available to rid both the individual and the community of the risk posed by iVDPVs . At present, the GPEI is starting to implement routine poliovirus surveillance among PID pa tients as a new activity in the overall efforts to conduct surveillance for polio. This will complement AFP and ES and ensure the detection of non -paralytic poliovirus excretors, because AFP surveillance cannot detect asymptomatic immunocompromised patient s who excrete polioviruses, and environmental surveillance cannot identify the source of an iVDPV. Guidelines for conducting poliovirus surveillance among PID patients have been developed , providing clear, concrete instructions to introduce and conduct su rveillance for poliovirus among patients diagnosed with eligible primary immune deficiencies. Country prioritization for the implementation of surveillance was completed across all WHO regions. The criteria to identify potential countries to pilot PID sur veillance were the following : Fig. 16. Criteria to identify countries for pilot PID s urveillancea a Endorsed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization , April 2019 . Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , | 39 ; PID primary immunodeficiency disorder Source : WHO. In 2018, PID surveillance was introduced in Pakistan and the heads of departments of seven major hospitals in Karachi were trained. At the end of December 2018, one case had been registered. 4.4 Plans for 2019 -2020 The guidelines for conducting this surveillance should be fully developed and endorsed for implementation by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization in 2019 . To facilitate surveillance activities , the development of appropriate forms, agreement on core variables and indicators , and the development of an information system will follow. Training material will be developed based on the guidelines. Countries at high and medium risk will be recruited for pa rticipation in phase 1 of surveillance implementation during 2019. Preparation for implementation will include selecti ng sites, customizing the guidelines, training activities and working with regulatory authorities on access to therapy. Initial implementa tion will be followed by evaluation , and further expansion will take place gradually based on the lessons learned. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 40 5 Maintain the capacity and efficiency of the Global Polio Laboratory Network 5.1 Overview The Global Polio Laboratory Network ( GPLN ) consists of 146 polio laboratories in 92 countries across the six WHO regions of the world. These global, regional and national polio laboratories follow WHO - recommended procedures for detecting and characterizing polioviruses from AFP case stool and sewage specime ns collected from the environment. This is done through : (1) poliovirus isolation ; (2) intratypic differentiation (ITD) of isolated polioviruses ; and (3) sequencing of all non-Sabin -like or ITD -discordant polio viruses determine are WPV, Sabin (v accine) polioviruses or VDPV. The accuracy and timeliness of testing at GPLN facilities is monitored through an annual accreditation program me of on -site or desk reviews , which includes annual proficiency testing to ensure laboratories have the capacity to detect and characterize poliovirus from unknown samples. In addition to checklists for virus isolation (VI), ITD and sequencing, a n accreditation checklist was implemented in 2017 for laboratories testing sewage specimen s. In the last three years, the fol lowing areas were specifically emphasized : quality assurance ( e.g. through improvement in the electronic GPLN management system, technical GPLN guidance papers, generation of laboratory contingency plans and training workshops ); biorisk management ; molecul ar diagnostic capacity improvement (optimization of ITD algorithm and VDPV sequencing and reporting mechanisms) ; molecular diagnostic capacity building (through an increase in laboratories that conduct virus isolation and ITD [VII]); and ES capacity incre ase (through the validation and implementation of methodologies and an increase in the number of ES laboratories worldwide ) to support the global Polio Environmental Surveillance Expansion Plan . 5.2 Update on the G lobal Polio Laboratory Network 5.2.1 Laboratory ne twork capacity GLPN accountability has been increased through systematic improvement in all aspects of laboratory management and the introduction of real-time laboratory performance tracking. Of the 146 laboratories in the GPLN, 15 conduct VI alone, 100 conduct VII, and 29 conduct virus isolation, ITD and genomic sequencing (VIIS) , as of the end of 2018 . Two laboratories considered dormant are excluded from this categorization. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 41 Fig. 17. Global Polio Laboratory Network capacity - worldwide (a) and regi onal (b), 2018 (Fig. 17 a) (Fig. 17b isolation; Pacific Region Source : WHO . 5.2.2 Laboratory expansion to support environmental surveillance The development and implementation of the ES of poliovirus have been major innov ation s led by the GPLN in recent years. During 2016 -2018, 22 ES laboratories were built (fully equipped, trained and under quality assurance ) to support the 34 countries of the Phase 2 ES expansion plan ; 10 additional ES labs were built or upgraded to supp ort coun tries other than the 34 in the plan (seven in India, one in Nigeria and two in Indonesia). 5.3 Workload (specimens processed) The GPLN processed more than 1 2 100 sewage specimen s and over 2 10 000 stool specimen s from AFP cases and their contacts in 201 8, a similar rate overall compared to the previous year. The results of these stool specimen s were reported within 14 days of receipt in 95% of cases (the target is 80%) . Among the 6800 samples positive for poliovirus, 9 9% and 9 5% had ITD results reported within seven days of isolate receipt and within 60 days from onset of paralysis , respectively. As expected, due to broader implementation, a higher proportion of AFP contact (close contact and targeted health y children stool sampling) specimens were proces sed in the endemic regions ( the African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions ) compared to other non -endemic regions. 0102030405060 AFR AMR EMR EUR SEAR WPR Number of laboratories VI Labs VII Labs VIIS Labs1510029 0 20 40 60 80 100VI LabsVII LabsVIIS Labs Number of LaboratoriesCapacitiesGlobal Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 42 Fig. 18.

The combined field and laboratory performance indicator is to r eport ITD results for 80% of isolates within 60 days of paralysis onset in AFP cases (the target is within 45 days for the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean ). The overall poliovirus isolation rate is 3.7% (range: 1.9% to 5.2%). Indicators vary slightly for ES specimens in that laboratories should report >80% of virus isolation results within 21 days of sewage specimen receipt, >80% of ITD results within seven days of isolate receipt , >80% of sequencing results with in 14 days of isolate receipt and 80% of final results sent to national authorities within 42 days of the lab's receipt of samples.

Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 46 6 Progress on increasing the efficiency of p olio informat ion systems 6.1 Overview The Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 is base d on data collected annually from 244 countries and territories, including all 194 WHO Member States. These data are loaded, cleaned and harmonized in a global poliovirus information system. The GPEI Polio Information System (POLIS) is managed by the Detec tion and Interruption Unit of the Global Polio Programme, at WHO headquarters . 6.2 Accessing polio data using POLIS POLIS facilitates the data management of country - and regional -level data sets (AFP cases and related laboratory data, environmental specimens, immunization activity planning and monitoring, as well as campaign quality information). POLIS provides a central platform that enables data analyses for the GPEI by providing multiple outputs, a visual analysis of results via a dashboard and a search inte rface for all harmonized data at the most granular level (most at the second administrative subnational level) to generate tables, reports, charts, maps and timelines as well as to export the data. National -level indicators are calculated in POLIS using population data from the United Nations Development Programme and verified with the regional offices ; subnational indicators are calculated using population data provided by the countries. The POLIS platform provides role -based security access to various dat a sets and features . WHO , UNICEF , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , as well as their mode lling partners, actively use the platform . Fig. 23. Example of POLIS platform data Source : Polio Informatio n System , 7 January 2019 . 6.3 Polio information m anagement plans for 2019 -2020 The main objective for 2019 -2020 will be to increase the reliability and efficiency of collecting, managing, validating and using data for action. For example, not all information r eceived by WHO headquarters are uploaded to POLIS , largely due to the type, format and quantity of data received by regions. Additional details will therefore be incorporated into future releases of POLIS to accommodate the data received . In Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 47 addition, proc esses are under development to enable the direct upload of data (AFP and ES) by all WHO regional offices , allowing for cleaner, more timely data and better alignment with existing processes. Global Polio Surveillance Status Report , 2019 | 48 7 Conclusions While AFP surveillance performance at the national level appears to meet global indicators, at subnational levels , particularly in outbreak or high -risk countries, pocke ts of low performance are note d, emphasizing the need for the consistent and close monitoring of activities . Activities to supplement AFP surveillance are being im plemented in these regions, provid ing valuabl e additional confidence in the p rogram me's ability to detect poliovirus. The African and Eastern Me diterranean Regions have gained experience and insight as innovations have impacted program me performance over time, and the lessons learned should be considered a valuable resource to countries globally . Most notably, ES has been effective in identifying virus in the absence of detection through AFP surveillance. Additionally, ES has been u seful in identifying Sabin -like virus following outbreak immunization activities , enabling a better understanding of campaign effectiveness while also flagging areas of possible population movement from outbreak areas. Nonetheless, a s ES continues to expan d globally to support the detection of poliovirus, efforts to maintain a strong AFP surveillance infrastructure should be ensured. Moreover , the strong supervision and monitoring of both AFP and ES activities, the frequen t and meaningful analysis of data a nd the rapid investigation of issues detected should continue. Furthermore, sustained laboratory staff commitment continues to be a linchpin for the GPEI. Overall timeliness and accuracy performance indicators for poliovirus detection and characterization throughout the GPLN remain good in all regions . Additionally, GPLN ES capacity has increased to meet the program me needs and should be continually monitored as ES continues to expand globally . Improvements in polio diagnostic methodologies, quality assuran ce, communication and coordination should continue . The functionality and reach of POLI S has expanded considerably from 2016 to 2018, allowing for the active engagement of country and regional surveillance program mes. Efforts to increase the reliability an d efficiency of the system will continue beyond 2018 , with consideration of the evolving needs of the program me.
