The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:16 a.m. in room 106 Dirksen Senate Building, Hon. John McCain (chairman of theCommittee on Indian Affairs) and Hon. Michael B.

STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL B. ENZI, U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDU-CATION, LABOR AND PENSIONS Senator E NZI. I am going to call to order this historic joint meet- ing of the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee onHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions. Today's hearing will focuson the state of Indian health care and specifically the IndianHealth Care Improvement Act. We will be welcoming Senator McCain here shortly, and the rest of the members of the Indian Affairs Committee to our HELP Com-mittee meeting room. Senator Kennedy and I started a policy ofpunctuality and we are continuing that. We will go ahead andmake our comments and then they can make theirs when they ar-rive. Earlier this year, Senator McCain did approach me about holding a joint committee hearing on the state of Indian health care. I im-mediately accepted, as health care is important, perhaps the mostimportant issue facing tribes today, in fact, facing all people today.Today's hearing will enable us to chart our current progress anddiscuss what we can do to increase the services that are availableto address the physical and emotional problems that continue toplague American Indians and Alaska Natives. When the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was first signed into law in 1976, it was written to address the findings of surveysand studies that indicated that the health status of American Indi-ans and Alaska Natives was far below that of the general popu-lation. It continues to be a matter of serious concern that, as thehealth status of most Americans continues to rise, the status of2 American Indians and Alaska Natives has not kept pace with the general population. Studies show that American Indians and Alaska Natives die at a higher rate than other Americans from alcoholism, tuberculosis,auto accidents, diabetes, homicide and suicide. In addition, a safeand adequate water supply and waste disposal facilities, somethingwe all take for granted, is not available in 12 percent of AmericanIndian and Alaska Native homes, as opposed to 1 percent in therest of the Nation. Several years ago, residents of the Wind River Reservation in Central Wyoming faced a drinking water shortage that threatenedthe health and safety of everybody in the area, so drinking waterwas donated to tribal members and local residents. The lack ofthese basic services makes life even harsher for these people andcontributes to those already-high death rates. Coming from Wyo-ming, I know full well the problems we encounter in the effort toprovide quality health care to all people of my home State. As I noted during my visits to the Wind River Reservation, their problems are not unique. They have an impact on all those wholive on reservations from coast to coast. We need to take a variedapproach to address each of those problems separately. Clearly,people of different ages have different problems. A multifaceted approach to solving each of the problems will re- quire a systematic, as well as financial approach. Local, State andnational governments and agencies must work together with triballeaders to focus our resources where they will do the most good.That kind of approach has the greatest chance of being successful. I appreciate all the witnesses taking time out of their busy schedules to be with us today. In addition, of course, I would liketo welcome Richard Brannan, the chairman of the Northern Arap-aho Business Council of Fort Washakie, WY. No one knows betterthan he does the problems faced by those living on reservationsand by those who rely on the Indian Health Service for their healthcare needs. I am very pleased he was able to make the journey andto share his experiences with us today. I look forward to his comments and those of the entire list of wit- nesses. Each of you has a perspective and a point of view to sharethat only you can provide. I look forward to hearing a summary ofyour prepared remarks so that we can address the underlyingissues during our question and answer session. To the members of the joint committees, we have a longstanding tradition on the HELP Committee that opening statements aremade by the Chairman and Ranking Member, and due to the com-bined number of members of both committees and the fact that wehave three panels and the fact that we begin voting again at 3p.m., I would respectfully submit or ask that the tradition apply fortoday's hearing, but all members' full statements will be made apart of the record, as will all witnesses full statements be made apart of the record. In addition, members may use the question and answer period to make remarks. I did mention that this is an historic situationof having the two committees that have an intense interest in In-dian health working together to come up with some solutions. Ireally appreciate Chairman McCain suggesting that, and following3 through on it. I think this will be the first time that this has actu- ally been done outside of Energy and Water. This is probably anappropriate place to do it. [Text of S. 1057 follows:]4 1II 109 THCONGRESS 1STSESSIONS. 1057 To amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to revise and extend that Act.

I will make my statement part of the record and ask unanimous consentto do so. I would just like to comment that this act is long overdue. It is important. I think you, in your opening statement, articulated theimportance of this legislation very well. I am very pleased for Sen-ator Dorgan and I to have the opportunity to work with you andSenator Kennedy and get this bill done. It is long overdue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Senator E NZI. Thank you. [Prepared statement of Senator McCain appears in appendix.]Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA, VICE CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS Senator D ORGAN . Mr. Chairman, let me just add my thank you, and ask that my statement be made a part of the record. I havesaid often I think we have a bona fide emergency in health careon Indian reservations, the first Americans. I hope very much thatthis hearing is one more stimulus towards finally passing this leg-islation. We should have done it in the last session of Congress, butwe were unable to get there. So my hope is, and I believe Senator McCain and I have worked very hard and appreciate your cooperation to do this. My hope isthat we will get a bill to the President for signature that advanceshealth care on Indian reservations and with Native Americans. Thank you very much.Senator E NZI. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS Senator K ENNEDY . Mr. Chairman, I want to first of all join you in thanking Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan for inviting us toparticipate in this program. As we know, they have the primary ju-risdiction in terms of where Native Americans are living, and theenormous health disparities that exist for Native Americans in In-dian country. We know that also there are a number of Native Americans who are in urban areas. We want to try and make sure, to the extentthat we can, is harmonize whatever we are doing here and in yourcommittee so it ties on into the excellent legislation which theyhave introduced. I just want to commend them. It has been far too long since the Senate addressed this issue. We have many health challenges inthis Nation, but the disparity issue is such a compelling one. Wewill hear time after time of what is happening out there in Indiancountry this afternoon. And that is absolutely intolerable in ourcountry and in our society.335 Once in a while we get disparities in urban areas among dif- ferent kinds of groups, but if we look at the total range of healthdisparities, it does not exist in any place in our Nation as it existswith Native Americans. This cries out for action. It cries out for re-sponse. I just want to thank Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan for their leadership. This legislation is way, way overdue. I thank youfor having the hearing and giving the spotlight on this. I pledge towork with you and our colleagues to do what we can so we havea seamless web in trying to make sure that those whose traditioncomes from Indian land are going to have the kind of health careneeds that they are entitled to in our Nation. I thank you, and I would like to ask that my full statement be put in the record. [Prepared statement of Senator Kennedy appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI.

CHARLES GRIM, DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMANSERVICES, ACCOMPANIED BY ROBERT G. M CSWAIN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR; GARY HARTZ, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF ENVIRON-MENT HEALTH AND ENGINEERING; AND CRAIGVANDERWAGEN, M.D., ACTING CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER Mr. G RIM. Thank you, Chairman Enzi. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, we are very ap- preciative of this joint hearing that you agreed to hold and we arevery honored to be able to testify before you here today on the im-portant issue of the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Im-provement Act. My name is Dr. Charles Grim. I am accompanied today by Rob- ert McSwain, my deputy director; Craig Vanderwagen, our actingchief medical officer; and Gary Hartz, our director for the Office ofEnvironmental Health and Engineering. I will be giving the open-ing comments for the Department, but my colleagues are with metoday so that we can respond to your questions. This month, July 2005, marks the 50th anniversary of the Trans- fer Act, Public Law 83-568, which officially transferred the Indianhealth programs from the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] to theU.S. Public Health Service, effectively establishing the IndianHealth Service. The Transfer Act provided that all functions, re-sponsibilities, authorities and duties relating to the maintenanceand operation of hospitals and health facilities for Indians and theconservation of Indian health shall be administered by the SurgeonGeneral of the United States Public Health Service. This transfer was significant in that our program was moved to an executive branch department, then the Department of Health,Education and Welfare, and now the Department of Health and336 Human Service. This transfer was more appropriate to the role of the Federal Government in addressing the health care needs ofAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. Since the Transfer Act, thehealth status of Indians have improved significantly. Today, we are here to discuss another significant milestone in the evolution of our Federal Government's responsibility for theprovision of health services to American Indians and Alaska Na-tives, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which was first au-thorized in 1976. It forms the backbone of the system throughwhich the Federal health programs serve American Indians andAlaska Natives and encourage their participation in these andother programs. IHS has the responsibility for the delivery of health services to more than 1.8 million federally recognized American Indians andAlaska Natives through a system of IHS, tribal and urban Indian-operated facilities in programs based on treaties and judicial deci-sions and statutes. The mission of the agency is to raise the phys-ical, mental, social, and spiritual health of the American Indianand Alaska Natives to the highest level in partnership with thepopulation we serve. Our goal is to assure that comprehensive, cul-turally appropriate, acceptable personal and public health servicesare available and accessible. Our foundation is to uphold the Federal Government's respon- sibility to promote healthy American Indian and Alaska Nativepeople, communities and cultures, and to honor and protect the in-herent sovereign rights of tribes. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act builds upon the Sny- der Act of 1921, which authorized regular appropriations for the re-lief and distress and conservation of health of American Indiansand Alaska Natives. Like the Snyder Act, the Indian Health CareImprovement Act authorizes programs that deliver health servicesto Indian people, as well as providing additional directives andguidance. For example, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act contains specific authorities addressing recruitment and retention of healthprofessionals serving Indian communities, the provision of healthservices, the construction, replacement and repair of health care fa-cilities, access to health services, and the provision of health serv-ices to urban Indian people. We are here today to discuss the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and its impact on programs andservices provided for in current law. S. 1057 proposes to amendcurrent program authority to assure the highest possible healthstatus for Indians. Improving access for health care for all eligibleAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives is critical to achieving thisgoal and a priority for all those involved in the administration ofthis important program. S. 1057, however, also provides expansions which may negatively impact access by requiring the secretary to consult, negotiate, de-velop reports and establish programs and activities beyond the rea-sonable scope necessary to effectively implement the Indian HealthCare Improvement Act. In S. 1057, between desire to improve ac-cess and provisions that potentially compromise access, we hope tofind a means for achieving our common goal.337 Since enactment of the Indian Health Care Act in 1976, statutory authority has substantially expanded programs and activities tokeep pace with advances in health care delivery and administra-tion. Federal funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement Acthas contributed billions of dollars to improve the health status ofAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. Much progress has beenmade, particularly in the areas of infant and maternal mortality. The Department has also reactivated the Intra-departmental Council on Native American Affairs to provide a consistent HHSpolicy when working with more than 560 federally recognizedtribes. This council, which was authorized in the Native AmericanPrograms Act of 1974, gives the IHS Director a highly visible rolewithin the Department on Indian policy. I serve as the vice chairof that council. The Department has also revised our consultation policy recently through a process which involved tribal leaders. The policy empha-sizes the unique government-to-government relationship betweenIndian tribes and the Federal Government and assists in improvingservices through better communications. Consultation is conductedat different levels and includes annual budget consultations withtribes to ensure their participation in this important process. Theannual budget meetings provide tribes with an opportunity to meetdirectly with all department agencies and identify their prioritiesfor upcoming years. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has established a technical tribal advisory group which was establishedto provide tribes a vehicle to communicate concerns and commentsto CMS on Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP policies impacting theirmembers. IHS has been vigilant about improving outcomes for In-dian children and families with diabetes by increasing educationand physical activity programs aimed at preventing and addressingthe needs of those susceptible or struggling with this potentiallydisabling disease. The Department has not been a passive observer of the health needs of eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives, yet we rec-ognize the health disparities among this population do exist andare among some of the highest in the Nation for certain diseases,as you pointed out. We know that improvements in access to IHSand other Federal programs and private sector programs will resultin improved health status for Indian people. We support the provisions that increase the flexibility of the De- partment to work with tribes and urban Indian programs to in-crease the availability of health care, including new approaches todelivering care and to expand the scope of health services availableto American Indians and Alaska Natives. I commend Congress forincluding in S. 1057 various changes that respond to the concernsraised in previous proposals. Some of the changes improve the abil-ity of the Secretary to effectively manage the program. In the area of behavioral health, title VII of S. 1057, it provides for the needs of Indian women and youth and expands behavioralhealth service to include a much-needed child sexual abuse andprevention treatment program. The Department supports this ef-fort, but opposes specific requirements in certain sections of thistitle, specifically 704, 706 and 711. Essentially, it is a ''shall'' ver-338 sus ''may'' issue that diminishes the flexibility of the secretary in providing for these important programs in a manner that supportsthe local control and priorities of tribes and be able to address theirspecific needs. The Department also opposes a new section 104(a)(2) which pro- poses to allocate the Indian Health Profession Scholarship Programfunding by formula to the 12 IHS areas. If allocation by formulais authorized, students will not be given an opportunity to applyfor a scholarships if their area does not receive an adequate alloca-tion and if their desired profession is not considered a priority intheir area, even though there may be great needs nationally forsuch professions. We would recommend that this program remaina national program. My written testimony includes other specific areas of concern. In addition, the Department continues to carefully analyze all provi-sions contained in S. 1057. The department would like to continueto work with your committees to discuss our concerns with the billas drafted. Based on the work that has occurred between the Department and congressional committees in the 108th Congress on the prede-cessor proposal, S. 556, to this current bill S. 1057, I am confidentthat we can reach a mutual agreement on a bill that can be accept-able to our parties, including tribes and urban Indians, and raisetheir health status in the years to come. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have, and thank your for having us today. [Prepared statement of Dr. Grim appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you very much for being here. I will men- tion that we are going to have some confusion with votes that arestarting at 3 p.m. today, but one of the things that we do by havingpeople serve on panels, we are hoping that they are also open towritten questions. A lot of times we have written questions anywaythat go into much more detail than would be possible for us to beable to do in a forum like this. So we hope that all witnesses will be open to answering written questions, from all committee members. Our purpose is to build arecord so that we have the capability to write the best bill. I appre-ciate the testimony you have given. As you might be aware, I am very interested in expanding health information technology to all health care providers. We have donesome legislation on that. Could you briefly tell me what kinds ofinformation technology activities are occurring in the IndianHealth Service? More importantly, are there any barriers to broad-er implementation of those programs? Mr. G RIM. The Indian Health Service has had electronic health records for many, many years. Just this year, we started the imple-mentation of a fully electronic graphical user interface healthrecord. It has now been rolled out in 24 of our sites. We are inhopes that by the year fiscal year 2008 or 2009, we will have afully electronic health record in all of our programs. We are makinguse of the latest technology that there is. We have tele-health pro-grams that are excellent that are in the State of Alaska that tieall of the community health clinics into some of the regional hubhospitals. We are looking at the expansion of tele-medicine across339 our agency in the years ahead. We have it in various sites, but not others. So I would say, Senator, that we are I think right on the cutting edge. We are working with the President's Health InformationTechnology Program. We have representatives that are sitting onthat. I would be happy to answer anything further or more detailsthat you might about that for the record. Senator E NZI. I will do some followup questions in writing. Senator McCain.Senator M CCAIN. Thank you very much, Dr. Grim. For the record, you might mention who is accompanying you at the table. Mr. G RIM. Okay. I have my deputy director, Robert McSwain; Gary Hartz, our director for the Office of Environmental Healthand Engineering; and Craig Vanderwagen, our chief medical offi-cer. Senator M CCAIN. Welcome. Doctor, we have been around this track a few times before, as you know. Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir. Senator M CCAIN. Last year, you raised several objections. We tried to accommodate them. A lot of those objections have to dowith flexibility. You want maximum flexibility for the Departmentto work on meeting the health care needs of Indian people. I under-stand that. Most bureaucracies do. But some of the objections youraised last year and this year seem to reflect an unwillingness toaccord the same flexibility to Indian tribes. We find that not pro-portional. What is your response? Mr. G RIM. I would just say that we would continue to work with the committee if there are specific provisions in the bill where youthink that we are giving up the tribes' flexibility I would be morethan happy to discuss it. As I mentioned earlier, we have a very robust consultation policy within both the Department and the Indian Health Service, and donot make any major policy or budgeting decisions without consult-ing tribes. So we would be more than happy to work with the com-mittees on those specific issues. Senator M CCAIN. One specific issue, you raise objection to the GAO preparing a comprehensive baseline report on Indian healthfacilities that is presently in the bill. Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir. Senator M CCAIN. Yet your department has never been able to provide the tribes or Congress any total information on the num-ber, size or status of the Indian health facilities. If the GAO doesnot prepare a comprehensive baseline report, then who does? Mr. G RIM. The reason that we made those comments, Senator McCain, is that the agency has been in the process over the courseof the last 1 12years in consulting with tribes on a new priority sys- tem for the agency. It will be a more expansive type of priority sys-tem than our current one. We are in the final process of that. Wehad a tribally driven work group called the Facilities AppropriationAdvisory Board, made up of tribal members across the Nation thatdeveloped a priority system recommendation with waiting and cri-teria.340 We sent that out to tribal leaders all across the Nation. We re- ceived over 800 comments on that. The group incorporated thoseand they are very close to making a recommendation to me. Thatwill be a much more comprehensive listing than we currently have.That was the reason we asked that reference to GAO doing thatreport be removed. We feel that we are very, very close to imple-menting that. It has been through tribal consultation. Senator M CCAIN. How does a GAO baseline report interfere with any of the things you just said? Are you concerned about needlessexpenditure of taxpayer dollars? I do not see how a GAO reportwould interfere with any of the good things that you just described. Mr. G RIM. Our concern, I think, is that it would take additional time of agency staff. We are almost there. We almost have thedata. We would have to work with GAO I think rather extensivelyto get the data transferred over to them into a report, but if thatis the committee's wish. Senator M CCAIN. Mr. Chairman, I have several questions I would like to submit for the record. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses.Mr. G RIM. Certainly, Senator. Senator E NZI. Senator Dorgan. Senator D ORGAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Dr. Grim, you and I have had plenty of opportunity across the dais to talk about these issues. I will not ask you again the ques-tion, what was your recommendation to the Office of Managementand Budget for funding for the Indian Health Service. Was it sub-stantially different than that which was expressed in the Presi-dent's budget to the Congress? I have asked you that a couple oftimes and I think you have felt like you have been unable to an-swer it or unwilling to answer it and would probably get in troubleif you answered it. Do you still feel that way? Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir. [Laughter.] Senator D ORGAN . Why don't we get you in trouble today? [Laugh- ter.] Let me ask you, at a recent hearing one of the witnesses who tes- tified after you and Dr. Carmona spoke mentioned that the IndianHealth Service is funded at about 40 percent or 45 percent of thelevel of need. What is your assessment of that? Almost all of uswould agree that there are in many cases a bona fide emergencywith respect to health care on reservations, so it is funded at some-thing below the level of need. What is your assessment of the state-ment that it is only at 40 percent or 45 percent? Mr. G RIM. We have some data on that and we can provide that for the record, Senator Dorgan. Senator D ORGAN . But do you think it is 50 percent of the level of need or 75 percent of the level of need? Any notion? Mr. G RIM. We have data that we update annually on that and I cannot recall what the exact numbers are right now, but we willprovide that. Senator D ORGAN . Do any of your staff know the answer to that? It just seems to me like that is a pretty fundamental question.What is the need out there and how close are we to meeting theneed? I have said before in other venues that we have a trust re-sponsibility for health care for American Indians. We also have re-341 sponsibility for health care of Federal prisoners, and we spend about twice as much per capita for Federal prisoners' health careas we do for Native Americans'. So it seems to me just by observation we are something substan- tially below the level of need. I am trying to determine whether wehave any notion of what that is. Mr. G RIM. We do have a notion of what that is. I do not know if it has been updated for the current fiscal year, Senator Dorgan,but it is somewhere in the nature of 60 percent. Senator D ORGAN . At 60 percent? All right. That would suggest we are about 40 percent short of fulfilling the need, which is reallya serious, serious omission. My colleague, Senator McCain, asked the question about the health care facilities. I believe this year the recommendation is acut in health care facilities. I think it is around $70 million, $75million. I would share his question about why would anybody objectto a GAO baseline report. I understand that you are working ona priorities list. I also understand from an inquiry I made yester-day that that is about 6 months or 9 months away. Mr. G RIM. We have done the master health services planning for that whole process across our regions, but you are probably accu-rate in an about 6-month timeframe before a final report would bedone. What we still have yet to do is we have told the tribes thatif the recommendations that all came in resulted in a significantchange to either the criteria that we were suggested or theweighting of the criteria, that we would come back to tribal leader-ship one more time, show them the formula, talk to them about thechanges that had been made and why those had been made basedon the recommendations from around the Nation. And then if therewas not significant disagreement, we would implement that newpriority system, run all of our health services master plans throughthat, and then come up with a comprehensive list. Senator D ORGAN . Yes; there is an urgency to do that and get that done as quickly as possible. I hope you would not object to the re-quirement in the bill with respect to the GAO. If it is duplicative,so be it. Although perhaps by the time that would be implemented,you would have finished your report. I think certainly on behalf of those of us who serve on the Com- mittee on Indian Affairs, there is an urgency here to find a wayfor us to move this legislation forward. We are very frustrated. Wecould not do it last year. We should do it now. I hope that you andothers will play a constructive role in letting us, not letting us, incooperating with us to move this legislation sooner rather thanlater. Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir; Senator Dorgan. Senator D ORGAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator E NZI. Thank you. Senator Murkowski.Senator M URKOWSKI . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Dr. Grim. I always appreciate your being here and hearing from you. Your statement this afternoon does not makeany reference to the Dental Health Aide Therapist Program. Weare going to be hearing a little bit more on the third panel this342 afternoon. As a dentist and as a public health professional, can you give your opinion regarding this program? Mr. G RIM. I have traveled to Alaska numerous times, as you know. Senator M URKOWSKI . And we like that. Mr. G RIM. I am looking forward to coming again sometime soon. I have traveled with our former secretary to that region. We didhave an opportunity to talk with the tribes about that particularprogram the last time we were up there last summer. We felt thatthe program had merit, and since then additional views have beencoming forward and additional concerns. We are continuing to meet with all the parties that are con- cerned. We have met with the Alaska tribes. We have met with theAmerican Dental Association. We continue to try to look for a solu-tion to the problems of the high levels of unmet dental care thatoccur in the bush in the very rural parts of Alaska. We are commit-ted to working with you and with the tribes there to try to resolvethat issue. Senator M URKOWSKI . Some of us feel that one way to resolve it is through this Dental Health Aide Therapist Program. Can youkind of speak to some of the challenges that IHS has in recruitingdentists for rural Alaska and to these villages? Mr. G RIM. Yes; I can, Senator. We currently have about a 24 per- cent vacancy rate for dentists nationally, IHS-wide. The last statis-tics that I had seen from the tribes in Alaska showed that in theouter-lying parts of Alaska that number is getting close to about50 percent. We are having trouble nationally recruiting dentistsinto many of our programs. So we continue to work with organizations like the American Dental Association. We work with the U.S. Association of Collegesof Dentistry to try to do what we can to recruit at locations likethat, but currently we are simply lacking the ability to fill those. Senator M URKOWSKI . Are you having any success with that re- cruitment then? Mr. G RIM. We are able to fill our positions to this level, but we seem to be at about this level and cannot seem to quite get overto filling greater than about 75 percent of our dental positions rightnow. It has been hovering around that for a couple of years. Senator M URKOWSKI . So as we look into the future, then, with meeting the dental health care needs of our Alaska Natives in ourvillages, do you see a way that we are going to be able to getenough dentists out there in rural Alaska to meet the need? Mr. G RIM. I think it is going to require a long-term concerted ef- fort, but I am always hopeful that we are going to be able to dothat. We continue to have moneys in our scholarship and loan re-payment programs that we use to try to train new native students,and I think we need to continue to try to be very aggressive at re-cruiting current Alaska Natives who want to get into dental schooland try to encourage them to do that; get them into our scholarshipprogram and hopefully have them go back home and serve their ob-ligations in their communities, and then continue to stay with theirtribal programs and serve out their professional career. I do think it is going to be a long-term effort. We are working with all sorts of individuals, as I said, universities and the Amer-343 ican Dental Association, among others, to try to jointly work on that issue for the Indian Health Service. Senator M URKOWSKI . You have kind of ducked the specific ques- tion of how you feel about the Dental Health Aide Therapist Pro-gram. What I am hearing you say is you recognize the need. Wehave to do something. We must do something and that you aregoing to be working with us on that. Mr. G RIM. Yes; Senator Murkowski. Senator M URKOWSKI . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator E NZI. Thank you. Senator Reed.Senator R EED. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Grim.Let me follow on with Senator Murkowski's question and broad- en it to recruiting other health care professionals. It is not justdentists you have a problem recruiting. Could you lay out theshortcomings for recruiting as you see them today? Mr. G RIM. I can give you some specifics on percentages of where we are right now in many of the professions. I can supply that forthe record. Really, a lot of what we deal with tracks with what theNation as a whole is. There is a nursing shortage, and so we arefacing difficulty recruiting nurses as well. Pharmacy and dentistrycontinue to be areas where we have high vacancy rates, too, andit seems to track with some of the needs in the Nation as a whole. So not only are we facing the private sector economy trying to recruit the same types of people. Many times our locations arerural and isolated and so we have the difficulty of that as well ontop of it. But we do have, as I said, scholarships and loan repay-ment programs. We have very active recruitment programs fornursing, medicine, dental, pharmacy, and we are doing the best wecan. I know the professions themselves are looking at those issues, too, as they see the numbers of certain types of professions, youknow, more people retiring than are graduating and what it isgoing to mean for the country. Senator R EED. Is there more that we can do to assist you in terms of legislation or appropriations? Is this simply a social prob-lem that is beyond any additional help from us? Mr. G RIM. I guess if I knew the answer, we might already be here. Yet we would welcome any help that the committee might beable to provide us. We are still studying the issues, too, and work-ing with the various professional organizations. We have a largegroup of professional organizations we work with on a regularbasis. They are all very, very supportive of our program and try tohelp us within their own ranks of their professions, but we stillface those difficulties. Thank you for your support. Senator R EED. Doctor, Senator Dorgan alluded to the budget shortfalls which your rough estimate is about 40 percent gap be-tween the need and the resources. In high-cost parts of the country like Rhode Island, where we have the Narragansett Tribe, not onlyis this funding insufficient, but the costs are significantly higher.Is there any attention to these areas? Where there are high costs,housing costs in the area where the tribe has their tribal lands344 growing at 100 percent, I am not exaggerating, in the last five years. It is incredible. Mr. G RIM. I believe you. Senator R EED. It is hard to just maintain the staff. They have not had a raise in 5 years. Is there any attention to these specifi-cally high-cost areas? Mr. G RIM. Well, there are some pay adjustments that staff can get for living in higher cost areas, but one of the things that weare trying to do is to recognize it on a formula allocation basis. AsI said, whenever we get any new additional program increases, weconsult with tribes on how that is distributed across the Nation. Asthey have joined us in the process and the agency not making thosedecisions alone, our formulas for distributing money have becomemore and more complex, but more sensitive to issues like that. Wehave certain formulas now for types of funds that we give out thata portion of the funds are given out based on the nearest metropoli-tan area and the costs in that area. So we are trying to take someof that into account now as we allocate funds. We will divide a for-mula into three parts and maybe one-third is devoted to the costsin an area. So if you live in a higher-cost area, you get more fundsin that component of the formula. So we are trying to do that totry to address it within the funds that we have. Senator R EED. Thank you very much, Doctor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Senator E NZI. Thank you. I would mention that Senator Inouye could just be here briefly between committee meetings and the vote. He does have a state-ment to submit and questions that he will want to have submitted,too. And that is open to members of both committees, as well. Senator Coburn.Senator C OBURN . Thank you, Senator. Welcome from one Oklahoman to another. Glad to see you again, Dr. Grim. Mr. G RIM. Thank you, Senator. Good to see you. Senator C OBURN . Would you like to have an irreversible dental procedure done on you by a dental health aide? Would you wantyour family to have an irreversible dental procedure done by a den-tal health aide that has a high school graduation and some foreigntraining? Mr. G RIM. I think if I was in a situation where I was in pain with a lack of adequately trained dentists, I would be able to dothat. Senator C OBURN . That is my whole point. We are going to give less quality because we are not meeting our need. I just camethrough a campaign and one of the things I was critical of, and Iam critical of, is health care to Native Americans, with six timesthe rate for dialysis for Native Americans, six times the rate, whichsays we are not doing diabetes right. The question is, the ADA op-poses this, but why can't you work out a deal where they havelocum tenens up there? If they really do not want this to happen,why won't they volunteer for service up there? Let's work a deal.Let's have them do the right thing. You create an environment where we can have dentists who will volunteer their services for Native Alaskans and solve this problem345 while we are in a shortfall. I think you will find that they will be agreeable to that. I think that would solve the problem. But thisidea of not meeting our obligation, meeting it by name, but not inquality, I think is one of the most critical things we have to do atthe Indian Health Service. That is by no means a reflection on thepeople who work there. You have a burden and you do not havethe resources with which to carry out the completion and attackthat burden. With your electronic medical record, have you instituted best practices, especially for diabetes? Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir; we have. Senator C OBURN . And that is being followed? Are you tracking that to see the better outcomes and lower hemoglobin and A(1)(c)sand better compliance? Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir; we have. We have seen a downward trend in the hemoglobin A(1)(c)s. We are seeing better blood pressure con-trol; better us of the ACE inhibitors. We have an extensive data-base of almost our entire diabetic patient population, tracking bothclinical indicators. We also with the special diabetes program fundsfor Indians that Congress made available for us, we have just re-cently released the report to Congress that shows a huge increasein the number of both primary and secondary prevention programsin Indian Country that were present now, prior to the funds werenot available to the population. So we are seeing a very positive trend in the care of diabetes. We have been in the diabetes care business for many years. In fact, thediabetes grant funds, one of the things we did was put togetherwith professional experts in the agency and the American DiabetesAssociation a series of 11 or 12 best practices that tribes could usein their grants, depending on what were the particular problems intheir communities, and suggested ways they might assess which ofthose they wanted to do. So I think we have done an outstandingjob with the use of the funds that Congress given. Tribes deservea lot of credit for that because the vast majority of those fundswent directly to tribes. They have implemented a lot of great pro-grams. Senator C OBURN . I would just note that the Congress refused to support recently with an amendment that I offered for additionalfunding for diabetes prevention. We are going to buy more land,rather than take care of the Native American obligation that wehave. It was pretty disappointing to me. I think we got 17 votesin the Senate to fund prevention activities for diabetes, so it mightreflect on the Senate where our priorities are. Do you ongoing tracking on prevention across the board within Indian Health Service? Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir; we do. We have long been an agency and a health care system that focuses on prevention, not just in the clin-ic, but also in environmental health arenas as well, and safe waterand sanitation facilities, to make huge improvements. Senator C OBURN . So can you give me a time at which we are going to see the same type of diabetic control in the Indian popu-lation, Native American population, that we see in the rest of thepopulation in this country?346 Mr. V ANDERWAGEN . Dr. Coburn, I would say right now we are probably leading the Nation in diabetic treatment, not necessarilyprimary prevention, but in secondary prevention through effectivetreatment with evidence-based best practices. I would say we haveevidence to support the assertion that we are probably leading thecountry right now. Senator C OBURN . So we are going to see a decline in complica- tions, amputations, dialysis? Mr. V ANDERWAGEN . In fact, we have had a 50-percent decline over the last 5 years in amputations. We are the only sub-popu-lation where deaths due to ESRD have declined between 2000 and2002. I think the Senate, the Congress invested well in puttingthat money into that diabetes effort. Now, can we extend it to heartdisease, cancer and other chronic diseases is the real challenge thatI think we are facing in Indian country. Senator C OBURN . Well, best practices is going to help you do that. This is a great example to help us know how we solve the restof the health care problem in this country. It is called prevention.It is not treatment after the fact. It is prevention. And you all areto be complimented on the institution of best practices because itis what it is going to take for us to get out of the health care crisisthat we are in in this country. My hat is off to you. I just wantto see the results coming forward, and then work on the preventionin terms of diet because that is just as important for not only theNative American community, but the entire American community. Mr. G RIM. Our three primary focus areas that we have been working with tribes around the country on are health promotion,disease prevention, behavioral health issues, both alcohol, sub-stance abuse and mental health, as well as those behavioral issueswith the lifestyle diseases like diabetes and chronic disease man-agement. We are looking at better models with now that we mightput in place in many of our programs because we do have a hugeburden right now of patients that already have these diseases, butwe are focusing on all three of those areas. Again, we are lookingat some best practice models in chronic disease management thatwe will start using in some other disease areas. Senator C OBURN . I can ask this later and ask it formally as part of the record, do you have tracking on malpractice claims withinthe Indian Health Service as relative to outside of the IndianHealth Service? Can you give that data to the Committee so thatwe can look at it? Mr. G RIM. Yes, sir; I believe we can. Mr. V ANDERWAGEN . In brief, it is about 100 cases per year that come to torts. That rate really is about 50 percent compared to theprivate sector. Senator C OBURN . Come to trial or that are filed? Mr. V ANDERWAGEN . That are filed and deemed worthy and are carried forward. That has been a pretty steady state for about thelast 10 or 15 years, some slight trending up. Most of that is associ-ated with our larger, more complex hospitals, but we would behappy to give you the full picture. Senator C OBURN . Thank you very much. Let me just thank you again for your service, and I am proud you are an Oklahoman.347 Mr. G RIM. Thank you. Senator E NZI. Senator Murray. STATEMENT OF HON. PATTY MURRAY, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator M URRAY . Mr. Chairman, I know that we have a series of votes on and another panel to come before us. I will be verybrief. I just want to really thank you and Senator Enzi for having this joint hearing. I hope that this allows the members of our HealthCommittee to really begin to understand this legislation so we canmove it forward. I think we all understand the severe crisis facingour tribal communities today and the responsibility that we haveto make sure that we address some of the tremendous disparitiesthat are out there. I am very pleased that my friend Ralph Forquera, who is from the Seattle Indian Health Board, is part of the second panel. Ithink he is going to provide us with some really excellent informa-tion concerning Native Americans who live in urban areas. I ampleased that he is here. I am sorry that we are going to be havingvotes and I will be missing much of his testimony, but it is veryimportant for our committee to hear that. I think when we hear the statistics about the fact that Native Americans are much more likely to die from specific diseases, 420percent more likely to die from diabetes, 52 percent more for pneu-monia and influenza. It goes on and on. I think we have a respon-sibility, really, to address that. So Mr. Chairman, I will not ask a question at this time. I will submit them for the record. Dr. Grim, if you could respond becauseI do know we have a series of votes. I am really pleased that weare having this hearing and allowing our Committee to begin tounderstand this problem and help move it forward. Thank you very much.Mr. G RIM. Thank you for your interest. Senator M CCAIN. Thank you very much, Dr. Grim. You got off easy today. We had a series of vote. [Laughter.] Mr. G RIM. Thank you for that, Senator McCain. Senator M CCAIN. Thank you. We would really like to get down to some serious negotiations so we can get this thing done as quick-ly as possible. That is going to require, and I know some of thisis not totally up to you, but some of it going to require some conces-sions on both sides. We do have another body that has to considerit as well, who we have been in constant communication with, butthis is almost an abrogation of our responsibilities when we do notaddress this much-needed legislation. So thank you, and thank your colleagues for all you do.Our next panel is Rachel Joseph. She is the chairperson of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Reservation in Lone Pine, CA. She isalso the cochair of the National Steering Committee for the Reau-thorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.

JOSEPH, CHAIRPERSON, LONE PINE PAIUTE SHOSHONE RESERVATION Ms. J OSEPH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am here today to present testimony on behalf of the National Steering Committee for the Reauthorization of the Indian HealthCare Improvement Act, the National Indian Health Board and theNational Congress of American Indians. Thank you for this jointhearing and providing me the opportunity to testify in support ofS. 1057. The message of Indian nations across the country is please reau- thorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act this year. Thisact enacted in 1976 declared this Nation's policy to elevate thehealth status of our population to the highest possible level. We be-lieve this should be at parity with the general U.S. population.Nearly 30 years later, we are no where near achieving this goal.However, S. 1057 would facilitate forward movement. Health care reality in Indian country compared to the general population is our people still die due to accidents 204 percentgreater than rest of the population; 650 percent more likely to diefrom tuberculosis, a preventable disease; 318 percent more likely todie from diabetes. The epidemiology center in the Northern Plainshas recently reported that the Northern Plains Indians have thehighest SIDS rate in the world. The Surgeon General reports thatIndian youth are dying at 3.1 times greater than the general popu-lation. Our challenges are escalating, and like so many other programs in the country we are seeing employee take-backs, reduced hoursof operation, staff reduction and burnout. Resources are limitedand our estimates indicate that the Indian health budget has lostover $2.46 billion in purchasing power over the last 14 years. I have testified to this before. Medical inflation has increased over 200 percent since 1984. Unfortunately for the IHS, the OMBinflation rate ranges from 1.9 percent to 4 percent a year, whenmedical costs inflation is between 6.2 and 18 percent. Like the private sector, we face ever-increasing costs for pharma- ceuticals, equipment and other costs. As raised earlier by the Sen-ator, the per capita expenditures for our patients is approximatelyone-half of the per capita expenditures for Medicaid beneficiaries,349 and the expenditures for a prisoner's health care is almost double what is spent on a patient in the IHS system. In 1999, a national steering committee for the reauthorization was formed. Consultation was held extensively across the countryto develop consensus recommendations to address our currentneeds. Included among those recommendations was the authoriza-tion for a comprehensive behavioral health program which reflectstribal values and emphasizes collaboration among alcohol and sub-stance abuse social services and mental health programs, whichwas reflected in title VII of S. 1057. I was quite taken aback whenI heard Dr. Grim express objection to section 11(2)(b). In fact, thathas been a challenge for us in dealing with reauthorization. Wehave never seen a finite list of what the objections are. But if I might briefly talk about what our intent was when we developed language with 711(2)(b). This is a section dealing withfetal alcohol disorders. We feel strongly that we need to do every-thing we can to change the behavior of pregnant women, high-riskpregnant women, and women that are pregnant with Indian ba-bies, to encourage them not to indulge in alcohol and substanceabuse. That was our intent. We think this is a priority and wethink that the program should do this. We are surprised that thereis an objection to that provision. Another recommendation is authorizing the elevation of the As- sistant Secretary, elevation of the Indian Health Service Directorto an Assistant Secretary appointed by the President with the ad-vice and consent of the Senate. The deplorable disparities in our health indicators compared to the general population require us to assert that we need to ap-proach our responsibilities differently. Status quo is not acceptable.We believe that elevation would be comparable to the administra-tion of the BIA programs by an Assistant Secretary in the Depart-ment of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary for Public and In-dian Housing in the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment. We also recommend authorizing the Entitlement Commission to study the optimal way that health care should be provided to ourpeople. Indian tribes strongly believe that through the cession of400 million acres of land to the United States in exchange forpromises for health care and other services often reflected in trea-ties, that we secured a de facto contract which entitles us to healthcare in perpetuity, based on the moral, legal and historic obliga-tions of the United States. We also believe that we need to be ableto address the long-term health care for the elderly as an option,rather than more expensive, costly or clinical care. We believe that these recommendations, many of which are in- cluded in S. 1057, are essential to help us modernize our healthcare delivery. In closing, I want you to know that in spite of our deplorable health conditions, we remain optimistic because our tribal govern-ments and programs are having successes and do so much with solittle. We hope for reauthorization this year. We hope that one dayour young people no longer commit suicide because they will havehope. We hope that one day we will no longer have to deal withmeth problems and other substance abuse in our communities. We350 hope that our grandchildren will be healthy. We hope that we can provide long-term quality health care to elders in the waning yearsof their lives. We hope for all these things because we know that the Creator has put us here for a purpose and we need your help. Thank you for this time.[Prepared statement of Ms. Joseph appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you. Mr. Kashevaroff? STATEMENT OF DON KASHEVAROFF, PRESIDENT, SELDOVIA VILLAGE TRIBE, AND PRESIDENT, ALASKA NATIVE TRIBALHEALTH CONSORTIUM Mr. K ASHEVAROFF . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Don Kashevaroff. I am appearing here as the chair of the Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee, which has ap-pointed me to the National Steering Committee for the IndianHealth Care Improvement Act. I am from Alaska. I am the presi-dent of my very small tribe of 400. I am also the president andchair of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, whichthrough Anchorage and the Alaska Native Medical Center, we co-manage that and we serve 130,000 Alaska Natives through thehospital and water and sewer projects in various other programsthat we have. Both my small tribe and my very large company practice self-de- termination and self-governance by assessing the health needs ofour people and redesigning and expanding our programs to improvethe available care. I have a couple of issues that I want to address with you today. The first one is home health care. I also have submitted writtentestimony. Hopefully, that can be in the record, sir. What we foundat ANMC, we have 150 beds. About one-quarter of the beds wehave are taken up by folks that might or should not be there. Ifwe were a private sector hospital, they would discharge the people.We continue to serve them because we have no place to send them.Many of them need step-down units and various other care that wedo not have in existence. Home health care is in S. 1057, and we are very supportive of that staying in there. What we found out, as I have stated already,Indian Health Service does not have the money we need to providethe services to Indians. What we have been doing over the past fewyears is relying more and more on third party payers. We bill in-surance companies, if the Indian happens to have insurance, webill the insurance company. Those insurance companies actuallysay, well, you only can have a stay in the hospital for a couple ofdays and then we will not pay anymore, because they know thatthere are cheaper ways of providing health care to people thanstaying in a hospital bed. So we are kind of stuck with the hos-pitals and we do not have all the home health care provisions thatwe are looking for. So we are very supportive of that in the bill thatwe can expand those services. We have also found out that our elders, the best care we can give our elders are close to home. When we make our elders travel, theycome in and they actually encounter a foreign language, they en-351 counter English, and they have to be with us. They have unknown areas that they have to live in. They lose track of their families.They are removed from their family. Many of them just refuse tocome in for care. So by having a home health care-based systemwhere we are able to get out there and provide the services to themlike the rest of the country has realized, will modernize IHS andbring us up into where we should be, and be able to provide betterhealth care at a lower price. So we are very supportive of the homehealth care provisions in there, Senator. I would also like to touch on the Federal Tort Claims Act cov- erage. I noticed in Dr. Grim's written testimony that they thoughtthat there might have been an expansion of FTCA coverage. To thebest of my knowledge looking at the Act, there is no change inFTCA services to ineligible non-beneficiaries. The language doesnot increase any change in it. What we are faced with with Federal tort claims coverage is that we provide a service, and if we do not have Federal tort claims cov-erage, we have to take money out of our contracts support costs ora direct-service budget to pay for insurance that the government orIHS did not have to pay for before. So when our tribes take overprograms, we have to have coverage. If we do not have coverage,we have to pay an insurance provider. The amount is staggeringthat we have to take out of our direct services budget. In ANTHC alone, if we had to provide insurance for everybody, we would lose about four or five specialty providers. We have verymany specialty docs, and we would have to basically let them goand take the money and buy insurance. We do not want to be ina situation where we end up doing that. So I am actually puzzleda bit by Dr. Grim's written testimony that the Administration hasthese concerns that we are expanding coverage because we just donot see it, and maybe they can tell us later on where they see thoseconcerns at. Real quick, also negotiated rulemaking is in the S. 1057. The Tribal Self-Government Advisory Committee is very supportive ofnegotiated rulemaking. We have found in the past that when weimplemented title V of the ISDEAA that it worked extremely well.They even gave us awards for how well it worked, that we wereable to get IHS in the room, and the tribes in the room. The tribesare delivering the health care out there and we are encounteringa lot of things that IHS does not have to encounter. We have theunderstanding of how to provide health care out in the country. Byworking together, we are both able to understand the rules and putthe rules down on paper so we can work better in the future. Ithas helped tremendously, us both having the same common under-standing. I also wanted to mention about the dental health aide therapists. I know we are going to have a panel on that pretty quick. AlaskaNative Medical Center, which is managed by the Alaska NativeTribal Health Consortium and by South Central Foundation, westrongly support dental health aide therapists. Without question,that is our answer to our crisis that we are having in Alaska. Igrew up in a village that luckily had a dentist come every 6 monthsfrom Anchorage. And it was the same dentist, so he knew me, andI got decent care.352 People are concerned that there will not be good care. Well, these dental health aide therapists are sent out to school on it, and for2 years they are down getting trained to do what they are goingto do. I personally have had times when dentists maybe did not doas good a job on me as I wished they would have, and I had to goin for follow-up care. So I think it really comes down to the individ-ual person whether you are going to get a quality dentist or qualitycare or not. We have a huge crisis in bush Alaska. If you go to avillage of 100 or 200 people, you are not going to have a dentistwanting to live there. Even if you have a volunteer come in oncea year, it is not going to provide the services the folks need. I personally would love to have a DHAT work on my teeth, just as I go to a nurse practitioner and a physicians assistant for care.I have no problem doing that. Finally, I wanted to mention that the tribes want to have, fun- damentally we want to look at S. 1057 and make sure that it doesnot regress from anything in current law. There was one instancethat we found in section 403, which is the current law section 206,where Indian health programs may only bill third-party payers forreasonable charges as determined by the Secretary. This is achange. Our concern is by making the Secretary figure out whatthe reasonable charges are is going to increase the bureaucracy ex-tensively, as opposed to current practice where we bill under cur-rent practice methods. So I do want to thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chair- man, and hopefully trying to move this legislation forward. I amhere to answer any questions. Thank you.[Prepared statement of Mr. Kashevaroff appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you. Chairman Brannan. STATEMENT OF RICHARD BRANNAN, CHAIRMAN, NORTHERN ARAPAHO BUSINESS COUNCIL Mr. B RANNAN . Good afternoon, Senator Enzi. Thank you for ask- ing me to come and testify. I come from the Wind River Reservation, carrying a very heavy heart because of the suffering, the pain, that children and olderpeople are going through on our reservation. I want to thank youpersonally for asking me to come here, and giving us a voice. There are many statistics that justify the need for improving health care on the Wind River Reservation and Indian country ingeneral. I have listed a number of them in my written statementand I know you hear them from many others. But what I wouldlike to do is spend my time here today to try to put a face on theproblem that we are faced with every day on the reservation. My testimony here today is in honor of Francis Brown, a re- spected elder and ceremonial leader of the Northern ArapahoTribe, and Marcella Hope Yellow Bear, a baby, both of whom diedneedlessly because of lack of funding. Both of them suffered ter-ribly before their untimely deaths. Francis had four brain tumors.He went to IHS for assistance. He was told there was no fundingto help him to get the care he needed. He went home, suffered anddied. Marcella Hope Yellow Bear was 18 months old when she died.353 Her entire short life was one of torture and pain. According to the newspaper accounts, she had an open hole through her chin, nu-merous broken bones, and burns on her body and the bottoms ofher feet. She was found hanging from a coat hook in a closet. Thepolice found her that way. Physically abused and tortured, herwhole life was nothing but pain. When I did hear, it was like somebody shooting my heart with an arrow, and part of my soul died when I heard that. Both ofthese could have been prevented. The system and all of us failedthem because of lack of adequate funding. For his entire life,Francis Brown was one of the cultural and ceremonial leaders andelders of our tribe. Among his many contributions, he helped pre-serve the medicine wheel up in the Big Horn National Forest andother sacred sites. His early loss robbed not only his family, butour tribe of his culture and ceremonial knowledge. Marcella was a beautiful and innocent little baby, just so beau- tiful I cannot describe how pretty she was. She was also the hopeof our future. That is our future, our children. In our tribe, we be-lieve children are sacred and we hold onto them because they arenot tainted by the world and they are a blessing from God. Yet shewas killed by her own parents, both members of our tribe, becauseof their addiction to methamphetamine. Those drugs and others,including alcohol, are the scourge of our reservation in Indian coun-try. As you can see from these two painful examples, we need fund- ing for both prevention and treatment. I am here today to give mysupport to S. 1057, but also to remind you of the need to fully fundit and to remind you of the trust responsibilities of the UnitedStates to American Indian tribes. Also, the Almighty gave me a vision where I saw this beautiful, wonderful white house with a bright picket fence, immaculatelymaintained yard, with a swing, a play area full of children. I amsure people have experienced children full of joy, full of happiness,smiling, seen them dressed in their Sunday best on Easter Sundaywith their little beautiful socks and dresses and healthy and smil-ing, and just shrilling with happiness. That is the vision the Al-mighty gave me of the Northern Arapaho children and our people. I do know that this committee has the ability to make that vision come true for the Arapaho people, and I ask for your help. I thankyou for allowing me to testify here today. [Prepared statement of Mr. Brannan appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you. Mr. Forquera. STATEMENT OF RALPH FORQUERA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SEATTLE INDIAN HEALTH BOARD Mr. F ORQUERA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Ralph Forquera. I am the executive director for the Seattle Indian Health Board. I am also the director for the UrbanIndian Health Institute, which is a division of the Seattle IndianHealth Board we created in 2000 to conduct research and performepidemiologic studies on the health of urban American Indians.354 I am an enrolled member of the Juaneno Band of California Indi- ans, which is a State-recognized tribe from the San JuanCapistrano region of Southern California. The Seattle Indian Health Board is a private nonprofit commu- nity health center established in 1970 as a free clinic in what wasthen an old U.S. Public Health Service hospital, so we are celebrat-ing our 35th anniversary this year. We are currently under a con-tract and hold several grants from the Indian Health Service undertitle V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We are one of34 such nonprofit Indian-controlled corporations located in 41 citiesand 19 States around the country that contract with the IndianHealth Service under title V. About 20 of the 34 existing programs provide some level of direct care. The remaining 14 programs provide health education, infor-mation, referral assistance and other services designed to improveaccess to health care. In addition, urban Indian health organiza-tions play an important cultural role in many cities by offering pro-grams and services that are culturally appropriate and socially ac-ceptable to the wide array of Indian people living in cities. For ex-ample in Seattle we serve Indian people from over 150 AmericanIndian tribes and Alaska Native villages each year. The role of providing an identifiable and culturally acceptable place in American cities for Indian people is an often overlooked ef-fect of these programs that in many ways has become an essentialpart of the healing process for Indian people who often feel aban-doned and isolated in American cities. According to the 2000 cen-sus, the majority of Indian people are now living in American cit-ies. Over 70 percent of Americans who self-identify as American In-dian alone or mixed race on the census are living in American cit-ies. The trend toward urbanization has been steady since the 1950's when the policy of this Nation was to relocate Indian into cities inan ill-fated attempt at assimilation. Over 160,000 people were di-rectly affected by the relocation and termination policies. There re-mains a sizeable number of urban Indians who carry an emotionalscar of this experience with them. As a result, that experiencegreatly influences their behaviors and their ability to trust govern-ment institutions, including oftentimes our own. Little is known about the overall health status of urban Indians across the Nation. While the Urban Indian Health Program hasbeen a part of the Indian Health Service for nearly 30 years, onlyrecently have formal efforts to document the health of urban Indi-ans been attempted. The lack of available data has made it difficult for us to defend the need for help in addressing the growing health crisis amongurban Indians. However, in March of 2004, the Urban IndianHealth Institute released a first report documenting for the publicthe severe health disparities among urban Indians. Using datafrom the National Centers for Health Statistics and the 1990 and 2000 U.S. census data, that we know is woefully inadequate forurban areas, the report still found significantly higher rates of ill-ness and identified multiple known risk factors that likely contrib-uted to these findings.355 The report brought greater attention to the plight of urban Indi- ans and helped us to begin to build interest in looking at thehealth of this population. The report documented for the first timeour anecdotal assertion that urban Indians were experiencing ill-health in disproportionate numbers. Our principal partner in thiswork to date is the Indian Health Service, which has now includedus as one of the 10 Indian Health Service-funded regional tribal ep-idemiology centers, ours being the only one that focuses specificallyon urban Indians and is on a nationwide basis. Title V, the urban Indian health section of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, provides the critical link in recognizingthat Indian country encompasses both reservation and urban com-munities. The 34 urban Indian health organizations reflect the na-ture of their local communities. They offer not only services, but aplace of Indian identity that is frequently lacking for Indian peoplein American cities. In the broadest sense of healing, finding a placeof belonging and acceptance can have a powerful and positive effecton the health of Indian people. Our ability to focus on Indian people and not be encumbered by the restrictive nature of limiting services to federally recognizedtribal members adds to our capacity to heal wounds also. Title Vis the only authority that specifically defines the health care rolefor the Indian Health Service in addressing the needs of urban In-dians. For this reason, title V is an essential tool in assuring thaturban Indians are not forgotten as a group of Americans in needof health improvement. In the request for my participation in the hearing today, two spe- cific questions were posed to me. The first deals with the extensionof Federal tort claims protection for urban Indian programs. Thesecond concerns an issue that periodically has been brought to ourattention by the Department of Justice regarding equal protectionsprovisions of the Constitution and the fact that urban Indians arenot subject to tribal governments with self-governance authority. With regard to the Federal Tort Claims Act issue, similar protec- tions have been extended to community health centers through thePublic Health Services Act. Those of us who receive fundingthrough the Bureau of Primary Health Care are already eligible forFTCA protection. It would seem to me that extending this protec-tion to urban Indian health programs would add minimal risk tothe government. Inclusion could save considerable expense forthose programs who are now purchasing private liability insurancefor support for their work. The resulting savings could be used toprovide needed services. It should also be noted that the title V program is truly crafted using the community health centers as a model. So therefore theextension of the privilege of FTCA for another group of federallysponsored safety net providers seems a fair and equitable action. With regard to the Department of Justice's concern about equal protection matters, I first need to state that I am not an attorney nor am I professionally trained in this area. However, it seems tome that the enactment of title V defined a special class of healthcare provider similar to various arrangements made through otherFederal programs like the Federally Qualified Health Center Pro-356 gram under the Bureau of Primary Health Care and disproportion- ate share hospital payment structure under CMS and others. Clearly, the Federal Government has a rational basis for provid- ing funding, tax breaks and other benefits it deems to be in the in-terest of the Government or society in general. That rational basisshould not allow such distinctions to withstand an equal protec-tions challenge. In the case of urban Indian health programs, the Congress has a clear and rational basis for its decision to provide programs, serv-ices and funding to urban Indians. After all, it was the ill-conceivedpolicies of relocation and termination that led to the removal oflarge numbers of Indian people from reservations to cities. Con-gress dealt with Indians as a special class of citizens then, and itclearly can and should so do as it tries to rationally address theconsequences of those policies. The structure of the title V program, that of using a nonprofit Indian-controlled corporate structure, offers the full benefits of theself-determination principles called for in President Nixon's specialmessage to Congress in July 1970 that forms the foundation for to-day's Federal Indian policy. Successful urban Indian health organi-zations in some respects embody the spirit of self-determination.Our use of IHS funds to leverage our other public-private resourcesto extend our capacity to serve urban Indians is exactly what I be-lieve the authors of title V intended. It is clear that the Congress has the authority and the will to di- rect programs to address identified and documented health dispari-ties affecting American Indians and Alaska Natives. In these timesof rapid change in the health care system in America, and thesharp escalation in the cost of health care, the importance of hav-ing organizations devoted to assuring access and quality healthcare for Indian people makes good public policy. It is fitting, then,that the Congress continue this policy by reauthorizing Title V. Thank you for offering me this opportunity to testify. I would be happy to answer questions. [Prepared statement of Mr. Forquera appears in appendix.]Senator M CCAIN. Thank you very much. Ms. Joseph, what is your response to the Department's view that the Intra-departmental Council consultation and Tribal TechnicalAdvisory Groups are sufficient for Indian policy so that the ele-vation of the director to an assistant secretary is not necessary? Ms. J OSEPH . Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. The request or the advocacy for the elevation is not a new issue for tribes, for one thing. It has been around long before this effortto reauthorize. We feel the deplorable health conditions of our peo-ple warrant us to carry out our responsibilities in a different way,and maybe elevating the issues to a higher level would be a betterapproach. We know that status quo is not acceptable. We think that it is also consistent with the government-to-gov- ernment relationship in that it is comparable to the assistant sec- retary that has oversight of the BIA programs in the Departmentof the Interior. There is an assistant secretary for Public and In-dian Housing in the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment.357 We think an agency that has such large responsibilities for In- dian people should be at a level where they can collaborate at ahigher level in the Department; be a member at the table when pri-orities and policies are addressed; be a player in the decisions thatare made when the Department's priorities are established; and beat a level that ensures that other agencies in the Department arealso considering the needs of American Indians and Alaska Na-tives. Senator M CCAIN. What is your response to the Department's view that we should mandate positions such as the diabetes coordi-nators within IHS? Ms. J OSEPH . Mr. Chairman, I thought that was real interesting a request, to require a mandate when earlier in the testimonythere was an objection to mandates. In particular, that is relatedto mandating diabetes coordinators. For the record, I believe allareas have diabetes coordinators. The one we have in California,she is wonderful and we like her and she is doing a lot to inspireus, to prevent and to educate. But the tribal leaders during this discussion weighed this and did discuss it. They said, say for instance in five years we have amajor epidemic in our area, and we might want a cardiovasculardisease prevention coordinator or a tuberculosis prevention coordi-nator. With limited resources, the tribes locally may need to moveresources and have another priority in five years. That was thewish to have some flexibility for local decisions. Senator M CCAIN. Thank you. Mr. Kashevaroff, how would you respond to the views of the American Dental Association that there is a ''false concern'' that inAlaska that is only a choice between no dental care and some den-tal care, so that dental health aides are necessary? Mr. K ASHEVAROFF . I believe that anybody that wants to come up to Alaska and go out to the bush, which we call it, will see thatthere is basically no access to dental care out there. Village folksthat live there, if they have a toothache, they have a choice of ei-ther waiting six months to a year for a dentist from a regional hubto arrive, or to get on an expensive plane and fly in. That is whatwe are faced with. We do have some dental care. Dr. Grim mentioned that we have a 50 percent vacancy rate out in the bush in Alaska. That meanswe only have one-half the dentists. If Washington, DC only hadone-half the dentists, you would have a lot of lines around here ofpeople wanting dental care. So it is compounded in the fact that you live in a village and there is no way to access dental care than hop on a plane, whichyou cannot always do because we get snowed in for weeks at a timesometimes. And you only have one-half the dentists out there inthe first place. So we have a very big problem, Mr. Chairman. Senator M CCAIN. You mention in your statement that negotiated rulemaking was used in the self-governance regulations. What ben- efits have you seen in the implementation of the regulations? Whatis your response to the Department's concerns that negotiated rule-making is costly and time-consuming? Were your negotiations cost-ly and time-consuming?358 Mr. K ASHEVAROFF . Mr. Chairman, I was not privy to the budget of the negotiations. I do not think they are that time-consuming be-cause we actually had a deadline imposed. I know S. 1057 has alonger deadline imposed. But the little bit of time put up frontsaves a lot of time in the end. By us coming together and working out the issues with the IHS, the tribes and IHS working out the issues, getting on the samefoothold, understanding the same things, has saved us immenselyright now years later from having tons of lawsuits back and forthbecause we cannot agree on what we said. When we are both inthe same room, we negotiated it out and you had negotiations gowhere there is give and take, and everybody is satisfied somewhat,and we were able to achieve that. As I said earlier, they gave us some kind of awards because we were so efficient at doing it. I cannot imagine why the Administra-tion is against having negotiated rulemaking after we have been sosuccessful in the past. Senator M CCAIN. As has self-governance. Mr. K ASHEVAROFF . Yes. Senator M CCAIN. Chairman Brannan, in your testimony you state that addiction to methamphetamine and alcohol are epidemicon your reservation. What is currently being done to combat theproblem and, in your opinion, will the new comprehensive care be-havioral health programs provided in the Act be helpful in anyway? Mr. B RANNAN . Yes, Chairman; they would be. Senator M CCAIN. It is epidemic on your reservation? Mr. B RANNAN . Yes; it is. Senator M CCAIN. Would you give me a few statistics to describe that situation? Mr. B RANNAN . I guess throughout Wyoming it is considered epi- demic, even in the State of Wyoming. I do not have the specifics. Senator M CCAIN. For example, most of your teenagers? Mr. B RANNAN . What you see is an underlying culture of people, and we have a number of tribal members coming up and saying,can you please do something for my family member; they are goingto die, because all they are doing is ingesting poison into their sys-tem. There is no place for us to send them. There is no treatmentdollars available for methamphetamine whatsoever. Alcohol is asignificant problem, but methamphetamine is 50 times worse. Probably their life expectancy is less than 5 years once they take it for the first time. Typically, they are addicted for life once theydo it, just the first time. There is a significant backlog of patientsthat need alcohol treatment alone. In some instances, it takes them6 months to 9 months just to go to treatment. With an alcoholic,if they finally identify or I guess understand that they do have aproblem, they confess it, you need to get them to treatment as soonas possible. It is a constant theme. People are dying from cirrhosis. Senator M CCAIN. You have a lot of dental problems, I would think. Mr. B RANNAN . Oh, yes. Senator M CCAIN. Because of methamphetamines. Mr. B RANNAN . Yes, yes. Even without the methamphetamines, we can only serve 25 percent of our actual need. Our service unit359 is funded at 51 percent of the level of need funding. Our denial rate is about three times more than what they approve under a contracthealth service budget. We are sending people home that have can-cer, saying there is no money for chemotherapy, therefore you haveto die. That is the reality of it. Senator M CCAIN. Then you must have a problem with teen sui- cide as well. Mr. B RANNAN . Yes; we did in the 1980's, there were over 20-some young people that killed themselves, one right after another. It isconsistent. Senator M CCAIN. Is that associated quite often with the use of meth? Mr. B RANNAN . No; it is mainly associated with the lack of hope on the reservation, lack of opportunity. What we are doing rightnow is we are trying to develop a boys and girls club to give themsome type of outlet. But the main thing is prevention on the res-ervation. Right now, the lack of funding within IHS is so signifi-cant we cannot even do prevention. We have to wait until some-body is sick or almost dying because the funding is so inadequate.What we need is preventive health dollars. We can work with ourchildren. We can get them to exercise. We can get them to have avision for their future, hope. But right now, we do not have thatresource available. Senator M CCAIN. Mr. Forquera, is your clinic the only urban clinic doing epidemiologic studies on urban Indians? Mr. F ORQUERA . It is currently, Senator. We actually established the Urban Indian Health Institute out of frustration on my part.Nobody was doing work to directly address the issue of urban Indi-ans. Shortly after we established the organization, Dr. Trujillo, whowas then the director of the Indian Health Service, who had hadsome experience working in the urban Indian community, helpedto find some resources to help us set up the epidemiology side ofthe research element of the program. We have been struggling since we have had no directed resource in order to be able to track the health of urban Indians, and thefact that a lot of our data has to come from local municipalities orfrom other institutions that sometimes do and sometimes do notcollect information that is Indian-specific. We have been having togo and develop those databases in order to be able to do the workthat we are doing. We are in the process of doing that now, andI think are making progress, but we are also finding tremendousobstacles because of resource and other problems. Senator M CCAIN. Many of your patients are in Seattle due to the policies of relocation and termination. Do you maintain contactswith the tribes in which these individuals may be members? Mr. F ORQUERA . A large number of our clients are in fact enrolled members of their tribes. We also see a number of Indian peoplewho are members of terminated tribes. We see a few Canadian In-dians who come down. And then we are also identifying an awfullot of Indians who were adoptees or children of adoptees or peoplethat had been displaced from their nativeness not only in the1950's, but prior to that. One of the great advantages of the work that we do and one of the fun things that we do is helping people re-link themselves up360 to their nativeness. It is amazing the power of that experience for the individual and how good that makes us as an institution feelthat we can help people reconnect with their roots and help them.They then become great supporters of the organization. They getservices from us. They help the community by using their skills aspart of the community. It is a wonderful thing. Senator M CCAIN. Chairman Brannan, where is the nearest city or metropolitan area to your tribal lands? Mr. B RANNAN . Mr. Chairman, we have two cities. One is Lander, WY. That is approximately 24 miles from Fort Washakie. The othertown is called Riverton, WY. Senator M CCAIN. Are there problems with drugs and teen suicide in those non-Indian areas? Mr. B RANNAN . It is not as prevalent, but the meth problem is throughout the State, especially within Fremont County where thereservation is located. Senator M CCAIN. Are there meth labs on your reservation? Mr. B RANNAN . Well, a lot of it I believe is foreigners from old Mexico. They did have a drug bust, and I think they had 250pounds of methamphetamine. Senator M CCAIN. That is a lot of doses. Mr. B RANNAN . Yes; it is. Senator M CCAIN. Well, it is a national problem, as you know, but it also seems to be most concentrated in lower-income areas, andnaturally that means Indian country. At least we would see somebenefits from passage of this act, wouldn't you think? Mr. B RANNAN . Yes; it would help us significantly. Senator M CCAIN. I thank the witnesses. I thank you for your pa- tience today. I apologize for this back and forth shuttle as we tryto finish up our voting on the Department of Homeland Security.I can tell you at least we passed on amendment yesterday that di-rects funding directly to the Indian tribes, so it does not have togo through the State and local authorities. So a small benefit. Thank you for all you do. Thank you for your good work. We look forward to seeing you again. This panel is adjourned.Now, our last panel is Mary Williard, DDS, deputy director of the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel, AK; and RobertM. Brandjord, DDS, who is the president-elect of the AmericanDental Association in Washington, DC. Dr. Williard, welcome. Maybe out of pure curiosity, where is Bethel, AK located, in relation to, say, Anchorage? Ms. W ILLIARD . We are about 450 air miles west of Anchorage. Senator M CCAIN. And the population is? Ms. W ILLIARD . In Bethel itself, about 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the time of year. Senator M CCAIN. What is it in January? [Laughter.] Ms. W ILLIARD . Probably around 6,000. Senator M CCAIN. And in August? Ms. W ILLIARD . More like 7,000. Senator M CCAIN. Some come to the great State of Arizona in the wintertime, and we are always glad to have them. I thank the Chairman.Dr. Williard, who is that with you?361 Ms. W ILLIARD . This is my daughter. Her name is Suskwok or Shauna Williard. Senator M CCAIN. You are welcome to be here. Do you have writ- ten testimony? [Laughter.] Thank you. She is welcome here, Dr. Williard.Ms. W ILLIARD . Thank you. STATEMENT OF MARY WILLIARD, DDS, YUKON KUSKOKWIM HEALTH CORPORATION DENTAL CLINIC Ms. W ILLIARD . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, as you know, my name is Dr. Mary Williard. I have been practicingpublic health dentistry for my entire career. About 9 years of thathas been in the Public Health Service through the IHS. I completeda 2-year dental residency in general practice at a hospital in NorthCarolina. I have practiced both in the Navajo area as well as in theBethel, AK area. I have been in Alaska for 7 years working for the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation [YKHC]. I have also chaired theAcademic Review Committee for the Dental Health Aide Programsince its inception. On behalf of the Alaska Native Health Board and YKHC, I would like to say it is an honor to be here and have the opportunity totestify, and to bring my daughter to see how this great countryruns. I really think this is a very important hearing for the future of the people in my area and especially for the children. I learned thismorning that the ADA has started a campaign in our village news-papers that states that we are providing substandard care, second-tier of care to our village people through the Dental Health AirProgram, specifically dental therapists; that we are experimentingon the people of the villages. I am here to say very strongly andclearly that that is not true. I personally have a vested interest to make sure that that is not happening. I believe that what we are doing is a good thing andit has been well thought out. I know that the tribes and the peoplein the area are supportive of us. I am a little nervous so I might stutter a little. Anyway, one of the things that I have done as part of my role in the Dental HealthAide Program is help to develop the dental standards that dictatehow we work with the dental health aides and specifically the den-tal therapists, and how they become certified to provide the carethat they are allowed to do. The quality assessments that are beingone on our dental therapists are taken directly from the IndianHealth Service for dentists. We are not allowing them to providea second-tier or a substandard quality of care. They are expectedto provide the services that they provide at the same level of qual-ity. These candidates have been hand-selected from large numbers of applicants. They are very responsible, respectable members of thecommunity. I feel like we have gotten some really wonderful peopleinto our programs. Part of my job at YKHC is to supervise the den-tal therapists that we have there. We do have two dental thera-pists who have completed the 2-year training in New Zealand to re-ceive their diploma of dental therapy. These two young people are362 Alaska Natives and have been in our clinic for about 6 years now providing services. I have looked at every aspect of their serviceand their skills. I have found them to be quite skilled at what theyare doing. They learned well during their schooling. They havetaught our dentist, actually, some new materials and informationthat they learned in school. One of the other things that I do during my time in YKHC is I have observed the new dentists coming in from dental school. Ihave to work with them and bring them up to par with the otherdentist on our staff. What I can say is comparing dental schoolgraduates with our dental therapists is that I have seen that theskills are equal. Hearing Dr. Grim say, sort of hesitate whether he would let a dental therapist work on his own teeth or his own children, I amnot surprised. Most dentists are very picky about where they go.I do not know that I would Dr. Grim work on my teeth. I havenever seen what he can do. [Laughter.] But I can tell you that my children and I have been treated by the therapists, and I have no problem with that because I haveseen what they can do and I believe that they are very welltrained. They provide a good service. I look forward to allowing them to go out to the villages once they are certified and working in a general supervision capacitywith the dentist in Bethel. One of the things that I really think isimportant about this is that we will have very competent dentalproviders in the villages with the people on a daily basis, so thatnot only will the people out there be able to see a dentist maybeonce a year, but they will actually be able to see one when theyneed one, a dental provider. They will be able to see the therapist at the school, at the basket- ball games, mostly, in the villages, and be able to talk to them inthe grocery store and say, you know, gee, I know you told me Ineed to brush my teeth all the time, but what can I do when I can-not afford a toothbrush? And maybe when they are deciding whatto purchase at the store, they can, you know, what were you sayingabout the diet soda compared to the regular soda? Those kind of things are really important when you are talking about trying to change a community's habits about oral health.Daily presence is a much more effective way of changing habits ina population than the itinerant-type approach that has been uti-lized in the past. So I think that is a very strong aspect of our pro-gram. I do not think volunteer programs will work. I am not saying that I do not want to see volunteers come. Please come. Please doas much volunteer work as you can. I think that would be great.I do think that they do not provide the continuity of care that willaddress the issues that we need and to help build a strong preven-tion program. The drill-and-fill model is still the old volunteer model as well. When you come in and you see patients, you drill and fill and youjust get back out, and you have not made that connection with thepatient. It just has not worked. One of the things that I have seen as well is that village resi- dents have long, 30 years there have been community health aides363 in the villages. And when a doctor comes out to the village and talks to the patients and tells them what they know, the patientswill listen, but when the doctor leaves the room, the patient turnsaround and asks the community health aide, you know, is thatright? What can you tell me? So the trust is there when the peopleare there in the communities. One of the things about the Dental Health Aide Program is that the main focus is that we are looking at prevention. However, thedental health aide therapists are going to be there to help us dealwith the problems that are already existing. You have alreadyheard there is a very large problem with dental decay in our areas,unmet needs. Even if Dr. Grim was able to recruit dentists to ourarea to fill all the available positions, that is not going to meet ourdental needs. A study in 1991 was done in Alaska that showed thateven if the number of dentists in Alaska was doubled at that time,it would still take 10 years to meet the needs. So recruiting dentists to fill positions is not the only answer. We need all the help we can get. That does not mean we are lookingfor substandard care. That means we are looking for good qualitycare and we have come up with a method to do that. The dentalhealth aides or dental therapists have been working in a numberof countries for years and have a very good track record. In Can-ada, over 30 years of practicing; in Saskatchewan, being regulatedby the dental profession, there has never been any merited claimagainst a dental therapist, and they provide the same level of serv-ices and more than we will allow under our Dental Health AideProgram. So in closing, well, one other thing I would like to say is that we do thank Dr. Grim for his letter of support of our program, and wewill have that in our written testimony. We also have e-mails ofwritten support from the South Central Foundation in Anchoragethat states that they strongly endorse the Alaska Dental HealthAide Therapy Program. What I would like to ask you all, Mr. Chairman and the mem- bers of these committees is to please listen to the people that liveand work in these communities and refuse to take away our feder-ally recognized right to manage our own health care. Please sup-port S. 1057 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and donot limit the scope of practice of the dental health aides. Thank you. I am open to questions.[Prepared statement of Dr. Williard appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you. Dr. Brandjord. STATEMENT OF ROBERT BRANDJORD, DDS, PRESIDENT- ELECT, AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION Mr. B RANDJORD . Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am Bob Brandjord. I am president-elect of the American Dental Association and a practicing oral surgeon in Minnesota. I am hereto express the American Dental Association's strong support forusing dental health aides and other innovations in dental care de-livery to help reduce the disproportionate burden of dental diseasethat many Alaska Natives suffer from today.364 Equally important, I must state the American Dental Associa- tion's unequivocal opposition to experimenting on Alaska Nativesby allowing non-dentists to perform irreversible dental surgical pro-cedures. This is second-class care. It is unsafe. It is unfair. Andmost of all, it is unneeded. It is an admission that those who havebeen entrusted with the care of these people have essentially givenup on them. Instead of really focusing on preventing disease, thesolution is to extract it. Alaska Natives deserve better. They de-serve high-quality, fully trained, licensed dentists to provide thecare. They can receive that care if we can break down the bureaucratic obstacles that are preventing it. Decades ago, Alaska Natives werealmost entirely free of dental decay, but the trend has reversed.Many Alaska Natives now suffer from often severe untreated den-tal disease. Deterioration is due partially to the transition from thetraditional subsistence diet to processed sugary foods and bev-erages; partly to the lack of oral health education and proper self-care; and partly to inadequate access to appropriate dental care. Alarmed at the declining oral health of its constituents, the Alas- ka Native Tribal Health Consortium has resorted to the desperatemeasure of deploying dental therapists to extract teeth, drill outcavities, and do pulpotomies, which are like a root canal. With only18 to 24 months of post-high school training, these well-intended,hard-working people do not know what they do not know. They arenot prepared to routinely perform these procedures safely. Dentistsperform thousands of procedures every day with such expertisethat the public views them as routine or simple. But there is nosimple surgical procedure. I know this. I spend a great deal ofevery working day removing teeth. For example, extracting a tooth can lead to serious and in some cases life-threatening complications. It can lead to chronic andacute infection, injury to adjacent teeth, gums, and bone, includingfractured or broken jaws, displacement of teeth, parts of teeth, orforeign objects into the airway, gastrointestinal tract, and sinuses;even severe life-threatening breathing or airway problems. Proponents of the dental therapist plan argue that there are only two choices: Second-class care or no care. This is not true. Ourwritten testimony includes an alternative model that builds on thecurrent dental delivery system by making it more efficient. The au-thors include the dental director of the Alaska Native Medical Cen-ter in Anchorage. Central to this plan is the creation of the newmid-level aide called a community oral health provider. They canbe trained in Alaska and not in New Zealand. These community-based dental aides could provide the patient education and preven-tive services that ultimately are the best and perhaps the only wayto end the epidemic of dental disease that plagues Alaska Natives. Despite our attempts to help, we have continually run into a bu- reaucratic brick wall of opposition by those who, by their own ad-mission, are so vested in the therapist position that they will notconsider any alternative. Mr. Chairman, the public health agencies who took responsibility for providing care for Alaska Natives have been unable to meettheir own goals. Dentistry did not create this situation, but we arewilling to help remedy it. But therapists are a big step in the365 wrong direction. Rather, we need a dental health aide to provide education, prevention and appropriate services in every village. Weneed a more efficient system to provide the needed care safely andeffectively. We need less redtape. We urge the Senate to adopt the language offered on the House side by Chairman Young which supports dental aides, but pre-cludes the use of therapists to perform irreversible dental surgicalprocedures. I want to thank you for your time and attention, and I would be happy to answer any questions. [Prepared statement of Dr. Brandjord appears in appendix.]Senator E NZI. Thank you. I thank both of the people who testified. The one who is probably the leading expert among Senators among this would be SenatorMurkowski from Alaska. I will defer to her for questions. Senator M URKOWSKI . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to lead off with the questions. I unfortunately will haveto be excusing myself after this because I have to get over to theenergy conference, so I am splitting my time. I do not know. I am not the resident Senate expert because I spend a lot of time in the dental chair, but I do spend a lot of timetraveling around my State and do know that in terms of healthcare issues and the area where we are so lacking is in dentalhealth care. Dr. Williard, I appreciate your bringing your daughterhere. As a mom with kids that are spending a lot of time in thedental chair nowadays, it is at this age where we are able to makea difference with our kids. Unfortunately, our Native children out in the villages are the ones that are suffering most. They are suffering because of thechange in diet, as you have indicated Dr. Brandjord, and becauseof other changes as we are evolving as a new State, as a societythat is moving from a subsistence lifestyle to a cash economy. Itis hurting out kids' teeth. As a consequence, it is hurting us asadult. It is putting a stress and a strain on the whole health caresystem. What is the answer? The answers are very, very difficult. I, for one, I have a real hardship when people say that we are experi-menting on Alaska Natives by providing them with something. Weare not experimenting. We are trying to do something to take thatfirst step to give the care that is so necessary and is so needed. Iappreciate your testimony, Dr. Williard. I could tell that it wascoming from the heart and very unscripted. You are living there.You are talking with the people and you know that when you havea doctor come to town who just blasts in and blasts out, the infor-mation that was left with you while you were sitting in that dentistchair goes out the window with that dentist. I know because I was raised in a tiny community where the doc- tor came to town every other week. It was good news for my familythat my mother was not pregnant that year because she did not have to worry about whether or not she was going to deliver thebaby by herself or whether the doctor was going to be in town. Sowe know what happens when we do not have that continuity ofcare. There are lapse. There are gaps.366 So we have to do something. We have to do something. The pro- gram that we are talking about here today is novel. It is new andas a consequence it is raising concerns. I guess I would like to primarily direct my questions to you, Dr. Brandjord. When the first class of dental health aide therapistsgraduated from the University of Otago in New Zealand, the Asso-ciate Dean Tom Kardos, who himself is a dentist, said the follow-ing. He said: The dental therapist will be able to provide oral health care, including undertak- ing procedures such as fillings and extractions, along with educating their commu-nities in good oral health care and habits in accordance with the course they havetaken. He has been obviously an advocate for the program. He believes that the dental health aide therapists can safely do the work forwhich they have trained. So I guess my question to you is, what kind of reach-out or con- versation or dialogue has the American Dental Association had? Have you sent any kind of a delegation to New Zealand to meetwith Dr. Kardos, with his colleagues, to observe the level of train-ing that goes on; to attempt to work out some of the differencesthat you have indicated that we have with this program? Mr. B RANDJORD . Thank you, Senator. No, we have not sent any- body to New Zealand, but last year we sent six volunteers from ourgovernment affairs committee up to Alaska to work in the villages.They went through their normal credentialing process which wassomehow expedited thanks to Indian Health Service. They workedside by side with Indian Health Service dentists. They were ex-tremely productive and they worked with Alaska Native dental as-sistants and dental health aides that were there. Those dental health aides and dental assistants helped them with the cultural sensitivity and with continuity of care issues thatare brought up. Even in the Indian Health Service, there is a prob-lem with continuity of care with the low number of dentists andthe rapid turnover. So the dependence on continuity of care comes exactly from the dental health aides and dental assistants in the area. Dentalhealth aide therapists doing the procedures are not the answer.When we looked at the different things, the level of care that hadto be provided, it was very extensive care. If we could look at thescreen up there, you can see one of the patients that was treatedby one of our volunteers. That is not simple work. That is some-thing that is more complex. If we are going to take care of these individuals, we need fully trained, licensed dentists to provide that level of care. So that iswhat we are talking about. We agree almost completely with every-thing Dr. Williard was talking about in regards to prevention. Ab-solutely, prevention is the foundation of all health care. We knowthat. Dentistry has done a good job with prevention. We have todo a good job in Alaska, and that is why we believe that thereshould be dental health aides in every Alaskan village to help pro-vide dental preventive services, doing services such as providingfluorides, sealants, cleanings, and also placing temporary restora-tions.367 So we really think that is a very valuable resource and we agree on all of those things. In fact, when you look at our proposal, thatis exactly what it is about. Then we add the community oral healthcare provider who coordinates all these efforts among a number ofvillages and a population base so that when the dentist comes tothat community, villagers will have continuity of care through thedental health aide that is there, and dentists can be more efficientby providing care that is a broad spectrum of care at that time. Infact our program, when you look at it, uses the Anchorage Hospitalmodel, and with this efficient system to provide the care, their pro-ductivity increased many-fold. In fact, in the last year of implemen-tation, their production increased over 100 percent, and over a 3-year period of time, over 300 percent. So we believe that there are four things that we have to do. First of all, we have to fill up our quotas of Indian Health Care dentists.The American Dental Association has been to Congress and wehave supported increasing the loan forgiveness payments, whichseems to be a big advantage for getting students out of dentalschool going into the Indian Health Service. In fact, when we metDr. Grim and one of his assistants, Chris Halliday from IndianHealth Service, he said he believed if he had loan forgiveness forevery slot in the Indian Health Service for dental positions, hecould fill them. So he would need the funding for that. That is onething that we want to do. Second is prevention. I talked about that. Prevention is the foun- dation for dental care. Third, are the volunteers. We want to get the volunteers back up into Alaska. Senator M URKOWSKI . How do we get them there? We have the greatest State on Earth and we cannot get professionals to comeout to our villages. We might get them to come out and give us 1week or 2 weeks on either side of a fishing trip, but we need careand the care is not just when the fish are running. We have to fig-ure out a way. Mr. B RANDJORD . It is interesting you say that because our volun- teers went up there in the dead of winter. They were not there dur-ing fishing season. They understand they are not going up there ona vacation. They are going to work. We are putting together, andare now in the process right now of hiring a full-time individual atthe American Dental Association to work with finding volunteersand setting up the coordination of getting these volunteers into In-dian villages and into Alaskan villages. We are trying to get thecare where it is needed. In fact, when we were putting this together, it is interesting that we talked to other different health care providers who have volun-teer programs. The great State of Alaska is a little different thansome other States because when we talked to the American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they have a volunteer programand their members sign up to participate in these programs to goout specifically through the Indian Health Service. They have givenup on going to Alaska because of the credentialing problems. Theyare different than anyplace else. So one thing that this Committee could do is to bring about a central certification process that could be used for volunteers to go368 into these areas to help. Our volunteers that went, it has been a year and a half now, those that went then have to reapply and getrecredentialed now. If they went to one village for one week andanother village for another week, they would have to berecredentialed. That is inappropriate. Senator M URKOWSKI . It is. Mr. B RANDJORD . When we talked to the Joint Commission on Ac- creditation, of Healthcare Organizations those people say we couldwork with a much simpler form where there would be temporaryprivileges less paperwork. Senator M URKOWSKI . We want to work with you on that credentialing. Mr. B RANDJORD . We would love to work with you. Senator M URKOWSKI . From what I understand, we have extended that offer to kind of work through some of these issues on thecredentialing. To the best of my knowledge, you have not taken usup on the offer, so we would hope that we would be able to. Thatseems like one that we ought to be able to figure through. Mr. B RANDJORD . I would totally agree with you. It is interesting that I have a letter here from a dentist in Alaska. If I may readit, it is very short. It is dated May 25: On or about February 11 of this year, I submitted an application to participate in dental project backlog. During the first week of April of this year, I wasfingerprinted as part of the application process. It is now almost June. I understandthere are building transition issues on your part, but what is the status and fateof my efforts to help alleviate the access issues in the villages? So yes, we have made that effort, but we are not getting a re- sponse on the other side. I do not know how we do that. But ifthere is some way to aid us, and when we went out there, we didnot just go out on our own. We went with the Indian Health Serv-ice dentists and we worked with them. We believe that that is nota solution that is going to last forever, but if we can get them overthis backlog of dental disease, we believe we can make a difference. Senator M URKOWSKI . How many dentists do you think you are going to be able to or would have to recruit to be able to assist inthis effort, full-time dentists? Mr. B RANDJORD . For full-time dentists, I do not know. That would have to be through the Indian Health Service. I am not sure.But last year at our House of Delegates, which has 360 members,on 1 day, we handed out a paper, just asking how many would vol-unteer for a minimum of 2 weeks to go to Alaska. We had 140 vol-unteers. Senator M URKOWSKI . Well, I am not meaning to be the negative nabob here, but one of our big problems is that most of these vil-lages, there is no hotel. There is no bed and breakfast. You arethere and you might sleep at the home of the community healthpractitioner or maybe in the gym. It makes it tough on people. Sowe have some issues that just make this tough. We need to knowthat we have a realistic timeframe that we are dealing with, andthat we are dealing with enough numbers that we can actuallymake a difference. We need to get through this backlog, but we recognize that kids are born every day, and they are going to have the next generation369 of dental problems. So this is not just something that we can get on top of the wave now and be clear with. Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to submit the rest of my ques- tions for the record. I really apologize because this is extremely im-portant. I think you can tell that I want to do something. I hearthat you want to do something. We certainly know that from theAlaska perspective, those professionals who are giving so muchevery day want to make something work. I do not want to get in a situation where I feel it is the Dental Association saying this is our turf and nobody else can come ontoit. This is not about turf. This should be about the health and well-being of Alaska Native people. If we can put together a programthat provides for continuity of care, that is good and safe andworks, we have the benefits of telemedicine where you can be talk-ing to your real-live doctor in Boston and working on a procedure.We have made incredible advancements in the State with telemedi-cine. I would like to think that we can work through some of these issues so that we do not have dentists saying there is no other wayexcept for us to come up, and as Alaskans knowing that Shaunahere is going to be able to see a dentist two weeks out of everyyear, and hope that her toothache is during that 2-week time pe-riod. So work with us. Mr. B RANDJORD . We will work with you. We realize the epidemic of dental disease that is there. We want to do nothing more thanhelp to resolve that issue. But to resolve that issue, to keep doingfillings and extractions will not resolve it. What will resolve it isto have good preventive care. We can accomplish that with the den-tal health aides. In regards to your statement about the facilities and the bed and breakfasts up there, yes, the bed and breakfast for every one of ourvolunteers up there was bringing their own sleeping bag and sleep-ing on the floor of the clinic. So yes, we are familiar with that, butthey are still willing to go back. They are that dedicated. I thinkthat is something that is hard for people to perceive. I thank you for your concern.Senator M URKOWSKI . It is also hard for them to give more than 2 weeks, and that is one of our biggest problems. That dedication,that passion is there and they will come up and they will give, andit is extremely generous. We do not want to denigrate that generos-ity, but there is a recognition that there are 50 other weeks of theyear that are without any kind of care. So we will work on fillingthose gaps. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.Senator E NZI. Thank you. Senator Isakson.Senator I SAKSON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yesterday, I had one of those irreversible dental procedures known as a root canal, so I am having a tough time talking aboutthis subject. [Laughter.] Senator I SAKSON . I am honored to be here and appreciate both your testimonies. I am sorry I was late for the other panels. Dr. Williard, you are a dentist and I take it you oversee a re- gional plan. Do you manage the dental health aides?370 Ms. W ILLIARD . Yes; I do. Senator I SAKSON . I do not want to cut you off, but I want to get to the end question. Ms. W ILLIARD . Okay. Senator I SAKSON . And that is a full-time program for the Native Alaskans. Ms. W ILLIARD . Yes. Senator I SAKSON . How many dentists and how many dental health aides are in that program? Ms. W ILLIARD . We have nine dentists in the Bethel area. We have two dental therapists, and we have nine primary dentalhealth aides. Senator I SAKSON . Okay. Here is my question, and I did not get a chance to read. I take it this S. 1057 has a scope of practice com-ponent to it. What new scope of practice are these therapists oraides going to be allowed to do under this bill that they cannot donow? Dr. W ILLIARD . There is no new scope of practice that they would be able to do under S. 1057. What the American Dental Associationwould like to see done is to have this bill modified so that it takesaway the rights that we have to practice as we are doing right now. Senator I SAKSON . Okay. Now, Dr. Brandjord just referred to the program they had recommended. They have suggested a programwhich I take it drew the line on scope of practice for the therapistand the aides. Is that correct? Dr. W ILLIARD . Yes. Senator I SAKSON . You said you have nine dentists there in your program now? Ms. W ILLIARD . Yes. Senator I SAKSON . Then that is not enough dentists to do the irre- versible dental procedures? Ms. W ILLIARD . We have 15 dental positions in our area, so we have 6 that are vacant right now. As I have said before, fillingthose vacancies does not actually provide enough treatment abilityto meet the needs. So even if we were to get 100 percent filling ofthose positions, it still would not meet the needs that are out there.That would just meet the criteria that have been set by what isable to be funded by the IHS and by our corporation. Senator I SAKSON . One of the issues that comes up in many health professions in scope of practice is a shortage of trained peo-ple being the justification to allow a scope of practice possibly be-yond the training of others. Are we in that position in Alaska nowwhere we in effect have people who are trying to do the best theycan, but are not sufficiently trained to do, say, root canals, whichI think take a lot of training after yesterday's experience? I hopeso. Dr. W ILLIARD . You are talking about the dental therapists not having the training to do that? Senator I SAKSON . Yes. I am saying, in Alaska are we having to resort to asking people, with the best of intention, to do proceduresthey are not trained for? Ms. W ILLIARD . No; we are not asking them to do procedures they are not trained for. The dental therapists that we have sent totraining and are training further in our own facilities have a spe-371 cific scope of practice which limits what they can do in a patient care setting. That limit will keep them in a practice setting thatutilizes only what their skills are. If a patient's care needs get be-yond the limits that a dental therapist has been trained to provide,then they are trained to recognize those limits and refer to a den-tist. The picture that you saw earlier from the ADA, definitely I agree with them. That is beyond the scope of practice of a dental thera-pist. That patient would be referred to the hub clinics for treat-ment. But fortunately, that is not the only kind of patient we see.We do have a lot of patients that need a little less than that severecare, and can be seen by the therapists and the procedures thatthey are capable and competent of performing. Senator I SAKSON . Okay. Dr. Williard, in the proposal that the ADA made, what is it that you do not like about their proposal? Ms. W ILLIARD . They have excluded the use of the therapists. Senator I SAKSON . Totally? Or just for these irreversible proce- dures? Ms. W ILLIARD . The therapists are distinguished by the fact that they can do irreversible procedures. What their suggestion woulddo for a therapist is strip them of their ability to provide thoseservices. They would become basically a primary dental healthaide, which is a health aide that we already have and who we cantrain for about a month in Bethel to provide the preventive servicesand the fluoride treatments that they are providing already. So basically, it would be the equivalent of tying a dentist's hand or arm behind their back and asking them to treat a patient. Thatis what their proposal would do. We do not say that their proposalis not okay, for lack of a better word. I think it is a good proposalin some settings. I think it would be fine to do that CommunityOral Health Practitioner Program in parallel with the DentalHealth Aide Program. Anything that people are willing to do to tryand help provide more services to our area is a good thing as longas it is well thought out and supported with data. What I do not agree with is that the American Dental Associa- tion is not willing to allow that to happen at the same time as ourDental Health Aide Program is running. They want us to drop theprogram and then pick up this other program. That will not work.We have seen and looked at all of the studies that show that thedental therapist is a safe, quality provider. You can look at GordonTrueblood from Canada who has done extensive studies on thequality of care provided by a dental therapist. In those studies, he has shown that the quality is equal, if not better, than a dentist in the procedures that a therapist is allowedto perform. A therapist does not do a whole scope of dental proce-dures that a dentist would do. Their training is very heavily gearedtowards teaching them what their limits are. This is very differentfrom what you might learn in dental school, where you are taughtall eight different specialties in the dental field. Nobody tells youthat you cannot do something. Senator I SAKSON . Mr. Chairman, could I have the liberty of ask- ing two more questions? Senator E NZI. Certainly. Senator I SAKSON . I know I have gone beyond my time.372 I have said this before, and am not taking sides here even though it is going to sound like I am. The dental profession, of allthe health professions, seems to me to have done a remarkable jobof lessening the volume of work because of what they did in pre-ventive health care, fluoridation of the water, and good healthpractices. You, Doctor, and the association are to be credited forthat. It sounds to me like the exacerbation of the problem in Alaska over the last 10 years is a whole absence of that, or at least a sig-nificant one. Otherwise, it may be the change in eating habits, youreferred to people fluoridating and things like that. If it has been done once in the continental United States, under- standing there is a world of difference in Atlanta, Georgia andAlaska, and where Native villages might be. I know accessibility isa problem and everything else. I guess I ought to ask the Doctora question for a minute, because I have been directing everythingto you. Is your proposal designed with that goal in mind? If it is, can the number of trained professionals be available to meet the demandthat exists today, and even would exist if there were some lessen-ing of those problems? Mr. B RANDJORD . Thank you for your question. First of all, with the proposal that has been made, using the community oral healthprovider, that particular program, and it has been looked at bythese three people in education and then one who is the directorup at the Anchorage dental facility, they estimate that using thatparticular program, 85 percent of the individuals within that vil-lage could be seen and taken care of in any year. Now, that is inthe paper that has been submitted along with our written testi-mony. One other thing in regard to your comments about the scope of practice of individuals, part of the issue is that the expanded func-tion dental assistants can help do some of the reversible proceduresand that is why they become more efficient. They will have onedentist per three or four auxiliaries in the Anchorage facility work-ing in up to three chairs at one time so that they can be more effi-cient and produce more care, and then deliver also more preventiveservices. So yes, there is an expanded scope that is there that can be done, and yes they can reach more people. If I can just add one thing. You mentioned fluoridation. There are fluoridation units in the villages, but they are not activatedright now. Some of it is the CDC's requirements for maintenance.From our understanding now, we have some new technology thatCDC has and that has been implemented in the tribal villages inSouth Dakota where they have remote control of the fluoridationof the water system that can work. Senator I SAKSON . Well, I have abused my time. CDC is in my home State and if you all have any problem with them, you let meknow because you need all the help you can get out there. Your daughter is beautiful, Dr. Williard.Ms. W ILLIARD . Thank you. Senator I SAKSON . Thank you for the time, Mr. Chairman. Senator E NZI. Thank you.373 Ms. W ILLIARD . Could I make one comment about the program, the community oral health aide program? Senator E NZI. Certainly. Ms. W ILLIARD . Thank you, sir. The program, it was written by a panel of people who did include one of the chiefs from the Anchorage area, Tom Kovalesky. In tele-conferences and meetings with the authors of that proposal, andthe dental chiefs of Alaska throughout the State, Dr. Kovaleskyand the other officers did concede that this proposal was probablynot as effective in the rural areas and that it would be more effec-tive in an urban setting. The situation that we find in our individual villages, having to fly in by airplane and being spread out with such small populationsin some of these communities, the models that are used in that pro-gram do not apply. That is something that the dental directors out-side of Anchorage unanimously agree with. Senator E NZI. Thank you. I want to thank both of you and all of the other people that have testified. I apologize for the interruptions. We are still doing votes.Senator McCain and I have been shifting off and on here so thatwe would have somebody chairing and could continue to gather theinformation. All of this, of course, builds some testimony that willbe used in furthering the legislation, correcting the legislation,drafting additional legislation. There will be more statements submitted by other members of both committees, and questions that I hope all panelists will taketime to answer. You will not all receive questions because we willbe searching for things that are in your area of expertise or clari-fications on what you said in your statement or things that youmay have said today. Also, members of the panel, if you have some comments in re- gard to other questions that were not asked, or if you want to ex-pand on the comments that were made, you are perfectly able todo that, too. The record will remain open for another 10 days tocomplete that process. So I appreciate everyone who has helped out here today and the hearing is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 4:55 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re- convene at the call of the Chair.](375)APPENDIX ADDITIONAL MATERIAL SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL , U.S. S ENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your continued leadership on these issues which we have been working on for a number of years. I'd also like to thank you for opening this hearing up to our HELP Committee colleagues. Their expertise in healthcare delivery, will be extremely valuable as wework together to improve the health and well-being of Native Americans. I believe reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act will help us begin to close the disturbing health disparity in Indian country and allow us to ful-fill the United States' obligation for Indian health. According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, between 1998 and 2003, indus- try experts estimate that medical costs grew approximately 10-12 percent, while theIHS funding increases are less than 5 percent annually. When compared to otherFederal health expenditures, it's clear that IHS is grossly under funded. We havea responsibility to take a close look at the healthcare services we're providing to thispopulation and make sure that they're equitable and adequate. This issue is particularly important to Washington State. Between 1990-2000, the Indian population grew almost by almost 28 percent\u20147.5 percent faster than therest of our population. The life expectancy for Indians living in Washington is ap-proximately 4 years shorter than that of the rest of the population, due to factorsthat we can impact\u2014chronic under funding of the Indian Health Service, the lackof geographically available health services and the lack of trained providers that areavailable to serve the Indian population. We can address these issues for Washing-ton and the rest of Indian country by moving forward with the reauthorization ofthis critical legislation. To give you an idea of how badly this legislation needs to be updated, I'll use the example of behavioral health services. The current law limits behavioral healthservices to those dealing with substance abuse. While substance abuse is a criticalhealth issue, mental health disorders are not addressed. This is particularly alarm-ing when one looks at the suicide rate of the Indian population\u201491 percent higherthan the rest of the United States. Clearly there is a need for increased attentionto the behavioral health needs of the Indian population. I'm pleased to see the increased focus on preventative health in this bill. While Indian country is still experiencing a shorter life expectancy than other Americanpopulations, the causes of death have shifted. Today the leading causes of deathamong Indian populations are chronic disease rather than infectious disease, com-municable diseases. The health disparities that exist among the Indian populationare numerous and unacceptable. They have higher rates of almost every disease andadverse health condition: Alcoholism\u2014777 percent higher. TB\u2014650 percent higher. Diabetes\u2014450 higher. Accidents\u2014208 percent higher.376 Pneumonia/influenza\u201452 percent higher. Suicide rate\u201491 percent higher. Although the health disparities still exist in Washington and across the country, we have made progress. I am aware, for example, of our success in the Northwestin reducing the rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cancerand tobacco use through the use of health promotion and disease prevention pro-grams. Reauthorization would allow for the expansion of facilities construction op-tions, enhance tribal decisionmaking and enhance the ability to recruit, train andretain health professionals. The last time this bill was reauthorized was in 1992 and it expired in 2000. Since then, bills have been proposed every year to no avail. This is a very complicatedissue, it's a huge bill but the time has come to fully address the health needs ofthe Indian population. We have a legal and ethical responsibility to provide healthcare to Indians and this is the perfect opportunity to begin to address ways in which we can improvethe way we do so. One area of great concern to me is the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit implementation on Indian country. The Tribal Technical Advisory Groupwas formed to consult with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Studies (CMS) onreimbursement rates and policies. Under the roll-out of the transitional assistanceor, the drug discount card, under the Medicare Modernization Act earlier this year,we saw many problems in the implementation of this program. Beneficiaries wereoften confused about their choices and many didn't know they even had a choice tomake. Like other low-income elders across the country, low-income Indian elderswill experience a gap in prescription drug coverage when their costs exceed the ini-tial $1,500 coverage limit. Most Indians will expect their HIS and Tribal Clinics topay for their pharmaceuticals after they fully utilize their prescription drug cov-erage. However, IHS expenditures will not be counted toward the threshold to qual-ify for the catastrophic coverage under the drug plan. IHS will have to absorb allpharmacy costs for Indian elders up to the $3,600 annual limit. I am hopeful thatin consultation with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, we will re-solve this inequity. Another area of grave concern to me is the lack of attention that behavioral health services in our healthcare delivery system. According to the Indian HealthService, 13 percent of Indian deaths occur in those younger than 25 years of age\u2014three times that of other populations and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rightspoints out that American Indian youth are twice as likely to commit suicide. Reauthorization is especially important as it provides an opportunity to address the need for mental health coverage within the IHS. Title VII proposes a com-prehensive approach for behavioral health assessment, treatment and prevention. Under current law, behavioral health provisions are largely limited to substance abuse treatment and prevention and the issue of mental health is largelyunaddressed. The current Indian health bill is a product of much collaboration between tribal leaders, IHS officials and program personnel and it's imperative that we look tothese experts during this process. I'd also like to thank Ralph Forquera, the executive director of the Seattle Indian Health Board, for joining us here today. Each year, the Seattle Indian Health Boardserves over 6,000 individual patients and provides approximately 30,000 patient en-counters. While the Seattle Indian Health Board has become quite skilled at provid-ing high quality services with limited funding, they're currently facing a budgetshortfall of $200,000 for clinic services. We must work to make sure that our provid-ers have the resources they need to provide high quality health care to the Indianpopulations all over the country and especially here in Washington. I'm looking forward to hearing of the Seattle Indian Health Board's many accom- plishments, especially as they relate to the health needs of urban Indians. Once again, thank you Mr. Chairman for beginning the reauthorization of the In- dian Health Care Improvement Act and for holding this hearing. The time has comefor this bill to finally be reauthorized and I look forward to working with my col-leagues in the Senate to make this a reality year. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. D ORGAN , U.S. S ENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA , VICECHAIRMAN , COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS I thank Chairman McCain for his leadership.I thank my colleagues on the HELP Committee for joining with us in considering today the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2005. I am particu-377 larly pleased to note that two of our colleagues from the HELP Committee Senator Kennedy and Senator Bingaman\u2014have asked to be added as cosponsors of S. 1057. It is my earnest hope that, by working together\u2014together as authorizing commit- tees, and together with the Administration and representatives of Indian country\u2014the Indian Health Care Improvement Act will be reauthorized this year. I know our witnesses today will provide additional statistics regarding health needs in Indian country. We cannot, in good conscience, be satisfied with the statusquo like this: Native American youth are more than twice as likely to commit suicide; in the Great Plains area the likelihood is as high as 10times. American Indians and Alaska Natives are 517 percent more likely to die from alcoholism. 650 percent more likely to die from tuberculosis. 318 percent more likely to die from diabetes. 204 percent more likely to suffer accidental death. Over the past few months, my colleagues have heard me speak on the Senate floor about Indian health care in connection with amendments I have offered to the fiscalyear 2006 budget resolution and the fiscal year 2006 Interior appropriations bill. Myamendments proposed to provide an additional $1 billion for programs not only inthe IHS, but also BIA, tribal colleges, water infrastructure. I have talked on the Senate floor about people in tribal communities who are hurting and in desperate need of services. Many of these people I know or haveknown, or, in the tragic case of Indian youth suicide, whose surviving family mem-bers I have met with. I know this is true, too, for Dr. Grim and the other witnesses who will testify today\u2014you all see and hear and experience, every day, the very real need for thekinds of services and programs and facilities, the kinds of best practices, collabora-tions and innovations that S. 1057 would authorize for American Indian and AlaskaNative communities. I want to thank each of you who has stuck with this reauthor-ization process since 1999 and earlier for your persistence and continuing vision. I want to say that I am particularly pleased with and supportive of the provisions of title VII of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2005. Thissection of the bill would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2014through the Indian Health Service, the tribal health programs and the urban Indianorganizations\u2014to develop a comprehensive behavioral health prevention and treat-ment program. Such a program would emphasize collaboration among alcohol andsubstance abuse, social services and mental health programs and would benefit allage groups. Since the Committee on Indian Affairs' hearing on June 15 on teen suicide pre- vention, several more youth suicides have occurred on the Standing Rock Reserva-tion in North and South Dakota. The services and programs for Indian youth, inparticular, the training of paraprofessionals, the education of community leaders,the construction and staffing of new facilities and research that would be authorizedby title VII will make a very real difference in the lives of men and women wholive at Standing Rock, and all Native Americans. I look forward to the comments today of the Indian Health Service, the tribes and urban Indian organizations, and others and appreciate your help in improving thislegislation that will provide creative and effective solutions to address the healthneeds of Indian people. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL B. E NZI, U.S. S ENATOR FROM WYOMING , CHAIRMAN , COMMITTEE ON HEALTH , EDUCATION , LABOR , AND PENSIONS Good afternoon. Thank you for coming to today's joint hearing on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. There is no greater challenge before us in the Congress than the work we must do to continue to improve the quality of the health care that is available to thoseliving on reservations. Unfortunately, it seems that no matter how much progresswe make, there is always more to do. Today's hearing will enable us to chart ourcurrent progress and discuss what we can do to increase the services that are avail-able to address the physical and emotional problems that continue to plague Amer-ican Indians and Alaska Natives. When the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was first signed into law in 1976, it was written to address the findings of surveys and studies that indicated that thehealth status of American Indians and Alaska Natives was far below that of thegeneral population. It continues to be a matter of serious concern that, as the health378 status of most Americans continues to rise, the status of American Indians and Alaska Natives has not kept pace with the general population. Studies show that American Indians and Alaska Natives die at a higher rate than other Americans from alcoholism, tuberculosis, auto accidents, diabetes, homicide,and suicide. In addition, a safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal facilities, some- thing we all take for granted, isn't available in 12 percent of American Indian andAlaska Native homes\u2014as opposed to 1 percent of the general population. Severalyears ago, residents on the Wind River Reservation in Central Wyoming faced adrinking water shortage that threatened the health and safety of everybody in thearea. Canned drinking water had to be donated to tribal members and local resi-dents. The lack of these basic services makes life even more harsh for these peopleand contributes to those already high rates of death. Coming from Wyoming, I know full well the problems we encounter in the effort to provide quality health care to all the people of my home State. That is why Ihave always made it one of my goals to help bring that perspective to the hearingsand floor debates we have on the issues that affect the people of my State. When I was first elected to the Senate in 1996 I knew that quality of life issues on the reservations in Wyoming and throughout the country would continue to bea top priority of mine. I also knew that, in order to make life better for those livingon the Wind River Indian Reservation specifically, and other reservations nation-wide, my staff and I would need to be intensely committed to taking the issueshead-on and looking for creative ways to solve complicated problems. That is why I put someone on my staff who already had a great deal of experience with these issues and shared my commitment to act on them. His name is ScottyRatliff and he served with me in the Wyoming legislature. I tasked him with thechallenge of helping me to find solutions to the problems on our reservations thatwould be both progressive and culturally sensitive. Tribal leaders are already committed to making things better on their reserva- tions and I congratulate them on their vision and the hard work they have put intomaking it a reality. My only question continues to be, ''How can I help?'' In theyears since I have been in the Senate I have made numerous trips to the WindRiver Reservation in Wyoming and met and spoke with the residents and triballeaders. We all want the same goal\u2014a better life for those who live there. I am con-fident that working together we will continue to make the kind of progress we mustmake if we are going to find effective and efficient ways to address the problemsthat continue to plague those living on our reservations across the country. As I noted during my visits to the Wind River Reservation, their problems are not unique to them. To have an impact on all those who live on reservations fromcoast to coast, we will need to take a varied approach to address each of these prob-lems separately. Clearly, people of different ages have different problems. A multi- faceted approach to solving each of their problems will require a systemic, as wellas a financial approach. Local, State, and national governments and agencies must work together with tribal leaders to focus our resources where they will do the most good. That kindof approach has the greatest chance of being successful. Earlier this year the HELP Committee held hearings on the nomination of Mi- chael Leavitt to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services. I believe we arefortunate to have Michael Leavitt at the helm of an agency that oversees the healthcare needs of the people of reservations all across the country. I am also pleasedDr. Charles Grim is here with us today. Dr. Grim has an important job to do asthe Director of Indian Health Services and he knows firsthand the level of dedica-tion it will take to steadily improve health care for all American Indians. Dr. Grimhas an unmatched understanding of the needs of Native Americans that you can'tget from reading reports and memos from people out in the field. I have every con-fidence in his willingness and his ability to be an important part of the solution tothe health care needs of those on our reservations and beyond. Again\u2014the good news is\u2014we're making progress. As we do, we continue to find so much more that needs to be done. How do we best provide the assistance thatis needed effectively and efficiently? That is the challenge that lies before us. As we begin to hear from our witnesses, I would like to acknowledge and thank them all for their willingness to share their experiences with us so that we mightcraft a more effective bill to address the health care needs of our American Indianand Alaskan Native population. I would also like to welcome Richard Brannan, the chairman of the Northern Arapaho Business Council of Fort Washakie, WY. No one knows better than he doesthe problems faced by those living on reservations and by those who rely on the In-dian Health Service for their healthcare needs. No one understands better than he379 does the necessity of making progress in addressing the health disparities experi- enced by American Indians. Most important of all, no one is more committed thanhe is to making a difference in the lives of all those who live on the reservation. I know he has an important message to share with us based on his experience and background with all those who live on the Wind River Reservation. I look for-ward to his comments and those of our entire list of witnesses. Each of you has aperspective and a point of view to share that only you can provide. I look forwardto hearing a summary of your prepared remarks so we can address the underlyingissues during our question and answer session. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. I NOUYE , U.S. S ENATOR FROM HAWAII Thank you Mr. Chairman. I commend the committees for holding this hearing today. The status of Indian Health Care has significantly improved over the years and Indian mortality rates have declined. However when compared to the United Statesgeneral population Indians have a higher likelihood of dying from diseases such asalcoholism [770 percent], tuberculosis [650 percent], AND DIABETES [420 percent].Life expectancy is also 5 years less than the general population. Preventive healthservices are needed more than ever as is increased funding for those programs andservices. In 1976 the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law for the specific purpose of increasing the health status of native peoples. Since then billswere introduced in the 106th, 107th, 108th, and 109th congresses. Although theseefforts were disappointing, I commend Congress for continuing to work on these cru-cial issues. This bill is critical to Indian country. It authorizes behavioral programs, provides alternatives for rural dental care, and authorizes the Indian Health Service to pro-vide long-term care, are among the many positive changes that I have seen in thisbill. I believe it is congress' obligation to ensure that Native Americans have fulland timely access to health care. There is some language in the bill that I am concerned about because it may be detrimental to tribal sovereignty. However I will continue to work closely with mycolleagues. I commend my colleagues Senators Dorgan and McCain for drafting this legisla- tion. Once again, thank you for holding this hearing. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. K ENNEDY , U.S. S ENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS I commend Senator McCain, and Senator Enzi for convening this joint hearing on the Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization Act. The Nation has a legaland moral commitment to provide Native Americans\u2014the Nation's first Ameri-cans\u2014with the best possible health care, and I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of thisimportant bill. From the earliest days of colonization that brought infectious diseases to Native Americans, to the 18th century military conflicts that sought to destroy Native peo-ples, to the 19th century treaties that sought to confiscate Native lands, to the 20thcentury boarding schools that sought to undermine, tribal culture and language, thehistory of Native America has often been a shameful part of the history of America. The Federal Government has long promised better health care to Native Ameri- cans in exchange for land. Since at least 1926, the Government has been lookinginto the adequacy of such health care, but sadly, many of the inadequacies identifiedin the 1920's still exist today. Decade after decade, Congress refused to give tribes the resources to develop and operate their own communities. Too often, it was said that Indian peoples did nothave the expertise to invest such resources wisely to conduct their own govern- ments, operate their own businesses, educate their children, or provide health careto their people. For generations, this reactionary national mentality poisoned the re-lationships between tribes and the Federal, State, and local governments. Native Americans are eager to improve the health status of their people. They de- serve control of their own destiny, but they require Congressional action to maketheir vision a reality, and it is time for us to honor the commitments we made longago. Chronic underfunding of American Indian and Alaska Native health care by the Federal Government has weakened the capacity of the Indian Health Service, tribalgovernments, and the urban Indian health delivery system to meet the health care380 needs of the American Indian and Alaskan Native population. The Indian Health Service per capita expenditures for American Indians and Alaskan Natives are one-half of what is spent for Medicaid beneficiaries, one- third of that spent by the Vet-erans Administration, and one-half of what the Federal Government spends on Fed-eral prisoners' health care. As a result of inadequate funding, American Indians endure health conditions most Americans would not tolerate. Native Americans are 8 times more likely to die from alcoholism, 7 times more likely to die from tuberculosis, 5 times more likely to die from diabetes, and 50 per-cent more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza than the rest of the UnitedStates, including white and minority populations. Native American infants die at a rate 2 12times greater than the rate for white infants. Native Americans are at a higher risk for mental health disorders than other ra- cial and ethnic groups in the United States. Their cardiovascular disease rate is twice that of the general population.Their life expectancy is 71 years\u2014nearly 5 years less than the rest of the popu- lation. These statistics represent real people who deserve more from the U.S. Govern- ment. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has been amended many times, but it was only extended through 2001. It is long past time to reauthorize this act. Congress has been working to do so for the past 5 years. The current legislation reflects years of consultation with the Tribal National Steering Committee andholds great promise for improving the lives of Native Americans through com-prehensive public health efforts. Despite widespread support, the bill has not beenbrought to the Senate floor for a vote. A better future is well within our grasp. We have a unique opportunity to make much more rapid progress on the long journey toward respect for our First Ameri-cans. We must bring the Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization Act tothe floor. We must pass this legislation. Until every American Indian and AlaskanNative receives first class health care, we will never give up the fight. I look forwardto this hearing and to the testimony of each of the witnesses. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, U.S. S ENATOR FROM ARIZONA , CHAIRMAN , COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS Good afternoon. The bill before us today, S. 1057, is the latest iteration of the re- authorization of Indian Health Care Improvement Act that has lingered in the Sen-ate for many years. And while there was much debate about the measure at theend of the last Congress, the need to improve the provision of health care servicesfor Native Americans is undebatable. I am very heartened that our colleagues fromthe HELP Committee under the leadership of Chairman Enzi and Ranking MemberKennedy have so actively engaged in advancing the legislative process. I appreciatenot only their support, but the expertise and insight that the HELP Committeebrings to the effort. Nearly 30 years ago, Congress enacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to meet the fundamental trust obligation of the United States in providing com-prehensive health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. It was last reau-thorized in 1992\u201413 years ago. This act is the statutory framework for the Indian health system and covers just about every aspect of Indian healthcare. S. 1057 builds on that framework by pro-viding significant advancements in health care delivery and by promoting local deci-sionmaking, tribal self-determination and cooperation with the Indian Health Serv-ice. Those critical improvements include increased access to care, especially for Indian children and low-income Indians, programs designed to recruit and retainhealthcare professionals on Indian reservations, and alternative financing forhealthcare facilities and other services. Reauthorization of this Act is a high legislative priority. It has been 6 years in the making\u2014far too long for the much needed improvements. Substantial work wascompleted last year and we have but a few remaining issues that I hope we canresolve quickly so that the bill can be enacted soon. I welcome the witnesses andlook forward to the testimony.381 PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. PATTY MURRAY , U.S. S ENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman Enzi for holding this joint hearing. I'm happy that my colleagues on the HELP committee have this opportunity to learn more about thecrisis facing tribal communities today and why this bill is so critically important. Mr. Chairman, I believe improving the quality and access of health care in tribal communities is one of the Federal Government's greatest treaty obligations. Butwhen it comes to providing that care\u2014\u2014 the Federal Government has fallen short of its moral and legal obligation. Chairman Enzi, I'd ask for your commitment to continue to work together on this important issue so that we can help the Committee Indian Affairs move this billforward. I know you have some concerns about the bill and I'd like to work with you to address them. As you may know, this legislation has been through an exhaustivereview by tribal leaders and health professionals, the Committee on Indian Affairsand the Administration. And in light of two reports by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights documenting the health care disparities facing Native Americans living on reservations and inurban areas it is time for the Congress to reauthorize this law. Finally, I'd like to join with my colleagues in welcoming Ralph Forquera to the committee. Ralph is a national leader on issues affecting Native Americans livingin urban areas and I'm pleased to see he's here today representing the Seattle In-dian Health Board. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK KELSO , DDS, N ORTON SOUND DENTAL DIRECTOR NOME, AK As a dentist with 19 years of direct patient care experience in Western Alaska, I believe that I can speak with great credibility regarding the dental needs of theindigenous people of the region. I have observed the cycle of destructive dental dis-ease repeated from one generation to the next. The current method of itineratingdentists to rural communities for several weeks annually does little to elevate thepublic's aptitude toward the importance of good oral health. The dentists' role isviewed as one of simply alleviating pain and infection or repairing decayed teeth.While this service is important, it ultimately shifts the burden of one's own respon-sibility in the maintenance of their oral health to that of the provider. The dentists being of different ethnicity and cultural upbringing are not easily viewed as a role model for children and young adults to emulate. The dentists' short duration in the village also hampers their ability to bring about long-term patientmotivation. Patients respect the dentists' advice while they are there, but their en-thusiasm to better clean their teeth and limit the intake of sugary foods soon fadesupon the dentists' departure. Established poor dental habits re-emerge. A dental chart review demonstrates that patients receive the care that is war- ranted. An ongoing trend of preschool children being afflicted with rampant dentaldecay in the baby teeth and subsequent restoration of these teeth either by multiplesedation appointments locally or by operating room procedures in Anchorage is afrequent occurrence. The erupting adult teeth are cleaned, sealed, and fluoridatedbut ultimately succumb to the rigors of poor diet and hygiene. The teeth usually re-ceive several fillings of increasing complexity. In too many cases, the teeth reacha diseased state in which extraction of all of the teeth is the only viable treatment.Full dentures are fabricated. An analysis of the cost and effort to provide all of theseservices with the end result of being an edentulous teenager or young adult is sober-ing. Thousands of dollars per patient in both dental and hospital services along withassociated travel were expended. A change in public perception regarding the importance of good oral health is needed. Native American dental providers are key in this process. Dental Thera-pists, residing and working in villages of a high oral disease rate, will be a constantdental presence in those communities. They will have the luxury to examine andtreat patients more than once a year. More time can be spent on improving patients'oral hygiene index. Weekly fluoride rinse programs in the school will be an impor-tant job duty. But to gain the respect of the communities, the Dental Therapistsmust be known as the primary dental health care providers. They will obtain thisstatus by alleviating existing need. The Dental Therapists must be able to performroutine fillings, treat infected nerves in children's teeth, and extract painful, hope-less teeth. The dentists will still itinerate through the villages to perform more com-382 plex treatment, eventually providing higher level services such as root canal comple- tions, permanent crowns and bridges, denture fabrications, and orthodontic assess-ments not currently available in these remote locations. As the level of dental careincreased in the hub-clinic in Nome, the dental expectation of the community didtoo. A decrease in basic dental disease followed. Such a model could be extendedto the villages through the use of Dental Therapists. Another important aspect is the influence that the Dental Therapists will have on the school-age children and young adults. A criterion for the selection of all ofthe Dental Therapists in the Norton Sound region was that they all possess niceteeth, value a healthy smile, and practice good oral habits in their daily lives. Manyjunior and senior high school girls in the villages, the future mothers of the nextgeneration, desire to look their best like most American girls. They may wear trendyclothes, style their hair, and apply cosmetics, but the deteriorated condition of theirteeth negates these other measures. The Dental Therapists will frequently reinforcethe need to alter dietary choices and practice daily oral hygiene to improve this seg-ment of the population's oral health. Through the Dental Therapists own actions,they can inspire the youth that it is important and ''cool'' to have good teeth. It willnot be socially acceptable any longer to brandish a smile of decay -riddled teeth ormissing teeth altogether. Usually the children's teeth mirror those of the mother,either good or bad. This will be an excellent opportunity to stop the generationalcycle of rampant tooth decay and premature tooth, loss. The Dental Therapists willbe an ever-present, walking advertisement to the importance of good oral health. I urge the Senate Committees on Indian Affairs and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to support S. 1057 as it is written. The ability of the Dental Thera-pists to perform the procedures of fillings, dental pulp treatments, and basic extrac-tions is crucial to their success. The Dental Therapists' potential to bring about posi-tive long-term change is greater than that of any number of itinerant dentists, ei-ther compensated or volunteer. PREPARED STATEMENT OF TOMKOVALESKI , IRECTOR , SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION , [SCF] D ENTAL PROGRAM Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the SCIA and HELP Com- mittee regarding the practice of DHATs and section 121 of S. 1057, the IndianHealth Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2005. Please include my testimonyin the record of the July 14, 2005 hearing regarding S. 1057. I was honored to be one of the four authors of the paper, ''Integrated Dental Health Program for Alaska Native Populations.'' Since the first draft was released,I have been in regular discussion with tribal dental health program directors inAlaska. I have stated to them repeatedly that in my view the COHP model shouldbe viewed by them, by the ADA, and by Congress, not as a substitute for DHATs,but rather as a tool for achieving additional efficiencies and improvements. In myview, there is a place for implementation of COHP and DHATs as part of an inte-grated dental health program. I do not endorse the conclusion of the ADA that COHP can substitute for DHATs in resolving the crisis regarding access to dental services among Alaska Natives. Iwould recommend both programs be implemented as pilot programs with the resultsevaluated closely. While I think both SCF's efficiency expertise and the full imple-mentation of a COHP model may help the crisis, there is still a pressing need foradditional practitioners that expanded function dental hygienists and DHATs couldhelp fill. Throughout the development of the DHAT standards ultimately adoptedby the Community Health Aide Program Certification Board, I actively participatedwith other dental providers in reviewing the Standards and the research base formid-level dental practice and shared my concerns around the training and qualityassurance components. I believe that DHATs have the potential to be high qualityproviders with proper training and quality assurance. As a practicing, licensed dentist responsible for a large program serving both an underserved urban and rural populations, I do not believe the dental community canafford to reject any responsible approach to expanding access to dental services. Ibelieve dental assistant training, increased capacity, expanded function hygienists,COHP, and DHATs, provide such a responsible options for reducing the backlog ofdental disease in Alaska. I urge Congress to not make changes in the authority of the community health aide program pursuant to section 121 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Actunder which DHATs are certified so that we can evaluate their impact along withother strategies.383 If I can offer additional information that will help you in your deliberations, please let me know. INDIAN HEALTH CAREIMPROVEMENT ACT: QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD (SENATOR HATCH ) JULY15, 2005 Panel I Questions for Ms. Rachel JosephNational Steering CommitteeChairperson, Lone-Pine Paiute Shoshone Reservation No. 1. Title VII would authorize a comprehensive behavioral health program, re- flecting tribal values and collaboration among various substance abuse, social serv-ice, and mental health programs. You spoke of the need to have a ''systems of care''approach to mental health in addition to this comprehensive package. Can you tellme specifically what this ''systems of care'' approach would add to the comprehen-sive program already outlined in title VII? No. 2. The National Steering Committee has a long history with this legislation. Can you tell us what the major stumbling blocks have been to passing this bill inthe past, and how this bill has addressed these issues? Panel II Questions for Mr. Don Kashevaroff Alaska Native Health Tribal Consortium and Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee No. 1. What, specifically, are the concerns on the part of the Administration with negotiated rulemaking and how does this bill address those concerns? Why is nego-tiated rulemaking of particular importance to tribes? Questions for Mr. Richard Brannan, Chairman, Northern Arapaho Tribe No. 1. In your testimony, you stated that the Arapaho Tribe has a high dispropor- tionate number of diabetics\u2014would you please describe the current state of the dial-ysis program available to the Arapaho Tribe? No. 2. Regarding the issue of care for the elderly, you mentioned that most Arapho elderly, choose to remain in their own homes\u2014do you believe that theywould still remain in their own homes if better facilities were available to them? No. 3. I understand that family and domestic violence remains a large problem facing the American Indian population, and that expansion of related services isvital to combating that problem. What services are currently provided on the WindRiver Reservation with regard to family and domestic violence; and what servicesdo you suggest be added to enhance the current program? Questions for Mr. Ralph Forquera, Executive Director, Seattle Indian Health Board;and Director, Urban Indian Health Institute No. 1. I am concerned by your statement about the lack of available data needed to address the growing health crisis among urban Indians\u2014it appears that this cri-sis may be much larger than we are even capable of gauging. What are the mainreasons it is so difficult to collect data of urban Indians; and, do you have sugges-tions of what Congress can do to improve the data collection process? No. 2. Do you consider the trend toward urbanization to be increasing? No. 3. With regard to the Federal Tort Claim Act, you stated that inclusion could save considerable expense for programs that are now purchasing private liability in-surance to support their work ? can you provide a hypothetical estimate of thosesavings? Panel III Questions for Dr. Mary Williard, D.D.S. Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, AK No. 1. You support the current program which permits Dental Health Aide Thera- pists (DHAT) to perform various procedures on patients in remote areas. The Amer-ican Dental Association has concerns with three of these procedures (extractingteeth, drilling cavities, and pulpotomies). What programs are currently in operationthat are similar to the DHAT program? Do participants in these programs performthese controversial procedures? Can you provide us information on these programs:384 where they are, how long they have been in operation, what studies have been done assessing their safety and effectiveness, particularly with regard to these three pro-cedures? No. 2. You mention that the dental therapists will work under the supervision of a dentist. Who are these dentists and how can they supervise dental therapistswho are in remote villages? What ''back-up'' exists if a procedure runs into unex-pected complications?385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 "}
