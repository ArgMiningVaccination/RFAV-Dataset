Cover source: GAO. | GAO -22-105274 United States Government Accountability Office Highlights of GAO -22-105274, a report to congressional addressees September 2022 TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT Decarbonization Status, Challenges, and Policy Options for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage What GAO found Many technologies for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) are ready for wider demonstration or deployment, but multiple challenges limit their use. Carbon capture includes technologies that separate and purify carbon dioxide (CO 2) from a source, which could be an in dustrial facility (point -source capture) or the atmosphere (direct air capture). Applications of capture technologies at point sources are mature in some sectors (e.g., natural gas processing) but require further demonstration in some of the highest -emitting sectors (e.g., power generation). Direct air capture is not as mature, but has been implemented at pilot scale. Lengthy time to deployment and high costs hinder widespread deployment of both types of carbon capture in the near term. Technologies for transporting, storing, and directly using captured CO 2 are mature. Companies are beginning to commercialize utilization technologies that convert captured CO 2 into valuable products such as ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and mineral aggregates. However, many CO 2-based products are not competitive with conventional products, may be excluded from the market by industry standards, and lack a standardized method for ensuring they effectively reduce CO 2 emissions. Components of carbon capture, utilization, and storage GAO identified three aspects of CCUS deployment where challenges may arise: Cost. Deploying CCUS is an added cost to doing business but currently offers few opportunities to generate revenue. Incentives such as federal tax credits help offset the high cost of CCUS for some but not all emitters. Infrastructure development. More widespread deployment of CCUS would require a build -out of infrastructure for each of its components, including transport and storage. Timing of development, negotiatin g land access, and proximity of facilities are all challenges affecting this build -out. Community engagement. Deploying CCUS projects relies on acceptance by and effective engagement with local communities. In the past, unsuccessful community engagement and local opposition have contributed to cancellation or relocation of some CCUS projects, while others were well received. View GAO -22-105274.

Why GAO did this study In 2021, CO 2 reached a record high concentration in the Earth's atmosphere for the modern era. Scientific assessments have shown that reducing CO 2 emissions could help mitigate the negative effects of climate change. CCUS is one tool available to help slow, stop, or potentially reverse the rising levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere. This report discusses (1) the status of available carbon capture techno logies; (2) opportunities for using or storing captured CO 2; (3) key challenges that could affect the development, demonstration, and deployment of CCUS technologies; and (4) options policymakers could consider to help address these challenges. In conduct ing this assessment, GAO interviewed federal officials, academic researchers, industry organizations, private companies, nongovernmental organizations, technology testing centers, and federal advisory committees; convened an interdisciplinary meeting of 27 experts with assistance from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; and reviewed relevant literature. GAO is identifying policy options in this report. GAO identified seven policy options that could help address these challenges or enhance the benefits of CCUS technologies. The policy options are possible actions by policymakers, which may include Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, academic and research institutions, and industry. In addition, policymakers could choose to maintain the status quo, whereby t hey would not take additional action beyond current efforts. See below for details of the policy options and selected opportuniti es and considerations. Policy options to help address challenges or enhance benefits of CCUS technologies, with selected opportunities and considerations Policy Option Opportunities Considerations Research, development, and demonstration (report p. 20) Policymakers could enhance support for consistent funding of research and development and large -scale demonstrations simultaneously. Research and development could reduce cost, resolve issues, mitigate risks, and advance emerging technologies. Demonstrations could reduce cost and establish the viability of carbon capture by promoting learning -by-doing. Stakeholders have different ideas for research and development priorities. Requires careful oversight of large -scale demonstrations. Technology -neutral standards (report p. 3 4) Policymakers could encourage the creation, adoption, or use of technology -neutral standards. Could incentivize the development or use of products with the best CO 2 benefits. Could incentivize manufacture in the U.S. Standards development is a resource -intensive and lengthy process. Could be difficult to compare CO 2 benefits of different products without standardized life cycle assessment. Standardized life cycle assessment guidelines (report p. 34) Policymakers could support the creation and use of standardized life cycle assessment guidelines to validate CO 2 benefits of CO 2-based products . Could improve accuracy of comparisons between various CO 2 utilization pathways or products. Standards development and life cycle assessment are resource -intensive and lengthy processes. Coordination of many stakeholders to establish standardized life cycle assessment guidelines may be challenging. Framework for land access (report p. 4 4) Policymakers could support development of legal or regulatory frameworks to manage geologic storage of CO 2 at the state level. Legal or regulatory clarity could facilitate deployment of CO 2 storage infrastructure. Pore -space unitization processes could reduce the time and cost of negotiating land access for storage. Individual landowners may oppose losing certain property rights due to pore -space unitization. CO 2 storage projects may cross state boundaries, requiring coordination. Strategic siting (report p. 44) Policymakers could facilitate strategic siting of CCUS facilities. Could minimize financial and logistical barriers to CCUS development. Carbon capture and utilization industries may accelerate deployment if access to infrastructure increases. Certain geographic regions that are inherently more suited for CCUS could benefit more than others from infrastructure investments. Some communities may not want CCUS infrastructure for several reasons, including perceptions of environmental and safety risks. Modify incentives (report p. 55) Policyma kers could modify existing incentives to facilitate access for CCUS projects . Could increase the number or kinds of facilities that deploy CCUS. Could incentivize new technology development to reduce costs of capture. Modifying tax credits could reduce gov ernment tax revenues or increase use of fossil fuels. Modifying market -based approaches could be subject to uncertainty in carbon prices. Community engagement (report p. 62) Policymakers could support and encourage proactive community engagement around CCUS deployment . Better understanding of public opinion could guide community engagement and decision -making. Could build local support and reduce delays. Well -designed education and public awareness campaigns could be resource -intensive. May require new funding or reallocation of existing resources to support new efforts.

Washington, DC 20548 Introduction September 29, 2022 Congressional Addressees In 2021, carbon dioxide (CO 2) reached a record high concentration in the Earth's atmosphere for the modern era, and the concentration has continued to increase in the first half of 2022. The average 2021 concentration was 12.4 percent higher than in 2000. Scientific assessments have shown that reducing CO 2 emissions \u2014the most abundant greenhouse gas emitted thro ugh human activities \u2014could help mitigate the negative effects of climate change. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one tool available to help slow, stop, or potentially reverse the rising levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere. CCUS refers to a g roup of technologies for reducing CO 2 emissions or removing CO 2 from the atmosphere (see fig. 1). Capture includes technologies that separate and purify CO 2 from a source, which could be an industrial facility such as a power generation or manufacturing fa cility (point -source capture ) or the atmosphere ( direct air capture ). Both point -source capture and direct air capture result in a concentrated stream of CO 2 that can be compressed and transported \u2014typically via pipeline \u2014either for conversion into economically valuable products (utilization ) or for storage in deep underground geologic formations. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 2 In general, these technologies can reduce CO 2 emissions or remo ve CO 2 from the atmosphere. This offers the promise of improving the environmental footprint of materials underpinning modern life such as plastics, concrete, and steel. In addition to these environmental benefits, if the CCUS industry grows in the U.S., i t could preserve existing jobs and create new ones, and enhance the ability of U.S. companies to sell or export low -carbon products or CCUS technologies as more businesses and nations set greenhouse gas reduction goals. The U.S. is a global leader in CCUS deployment, with more than 50 percent of the world's capture capacity as of 2021. The maximum capacity of operational U.S. carbon capture and storage facilities is close to 20 million metric tons per year, or about 0.3 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emiss ions in 2020.1 In recent decades, the federal government has provided funding for CCUS research, development, and demonstration projects, among other policy support.2 For example, GAO previously reported that the Department of Energy (DOE) spent approximat ely $1.1 billion on nine large carbon capture and storage demonstration projects from 2010 through 2017.3 In addition, the Energy Act of 2020 authorized $2.6 billion for six demonstration projects through 2025 .4 We conducted this work under the authority of the Comptroller General to assist Congress with its responsibilities, in light of congressional interest in CCUS technologies. This report discusses (1) the status of available carbon capture technologies; (2) opportunities for using or storing captured CO 2; (3) key challenges that could affect the development, demonstration, and deployment of CCUS technologies; and (4) options policymakers could consider to help address these challenges.5 The evidence we collected for this review, including peer -reviewe d articles and other reports, stakeholder interviews, and an expert meeting all preceded enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.6 Costs discussed in the report are not adjusted for inflation 1This capacity does not include two U.S. carbon capture and storage facilities that have suspended operations, or facilities t hat sell CO 2 for uses that do not result in geologic storage. A fac ility may not necessarily operate at its maximum capacity. 2For more on the Department of Energy's role in supporting the development of CCUS technologies, see DOE, Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, Strategic Vision: The Role of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management in Achieving Net -Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Apr. 5, 2022), accessed Aug. 11, https://www.energy.gov/fecm/strategic -vision Fossil Energy: Information on DOE -Provided Funding for Research and Development Projects Started from Fiscal Years 2010 through 2017, GAO- 18-619 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 21, 20 -260, div.

See appendix I for a full discu ssion of the objectives, scope, and methodology and appendix II for a list of experts who participated in our meeting. We conducted our work from May 2021 through September 2022 in accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to technology assessments. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 4 1 Why CCUS? CCUS has the potential to play multiple roles in addressing climate change: Reducing CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel - fired power generation . Fossil sources accounted for more than 60 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2021. The major alternatives \u2014such as wind, solar, and nuclear \u2014likely cannot be scaled up quickly enough to r eplace fossil fuels in the near term. Retaining fossil fuels as part of the energy mix might help preserve jobs and avoid the cost of prematurely retiring fossil fuel facilities and associated infrastructure. Reducing CO 2 emissions from industrial sectors where emissions are difficult or impossible to avoid . For example, approximately two -thirds of CO 2 emissions from cement production are process emissions , which are released by limestone as it is heated rather than by fuel as it burns. Although new cement formulations can reduce process emissions, CCUS is effectively the only option for achieving net -zero emissions in this sector.7 In another example, manufacture of some products (e.g., steel) requires very high temperatures, which are commonly achieved by burning fossil fuels. Removing CO 2 from the atmosphere . Because it captures CO 2 from the atmosphere, direct air capture paired 7Net-zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions offset elsewhere (i.e., through CO 2 removal). with storage or uses that retain CO 2 for decades or more is an example of CO 2 removal .8 CO 2 removal can result in negative emiss ions. Direct air capture or other removal technologies may be able to help offset emissions from sectors where they are particularly hard to avoid. For example, alternatives to liquid fuels for long -distance air travel \u2014such as batteries for electric planes or hydrogen as a fuel \u2014are not currently feasible on a large scale. In all of these roles for CCUS, the amount of CO 2 reduced or removed will depend on what happens to the captured CO 2. Geologic storage is generally considered permanent (millions of years) , as is conversion into certain products, such as concrete. Other CO 2 utilization products only retain CO 2 for amounts of time that may be short (days to years) or moderate (decades to centuries), after which the CO 2 is released to the atmosphere. Geologic storage is essentially permanent and abundantly available in some regions of the U.S. Because of the relatively smaller scale of opportunities to use CO 2, reports on CCUS deployment expect that more CO 2 will need to be stored than used in the near term t o reduce CO 2 emissions. However, there are multiple benefits to CO 2 utilization that complement storage. First, it is 8In addition to CCUS -based removal (e.g., direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), CO 2 removal can use nature -based approaches such as reforesta tion or soil management. These approaches are outside the scope of this review. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 5 a more market -driven approach to handling captured CO 2 than storage and can yield revenue to help offset capture costs. Second, CO 2 can be an alternative to fossil fuels as a carbon source for certain products, such as aviation fuel and some commodity chemicals. Recycling captured CO 2 to make these products presents an opportunity to reduce their CO 2 emissions. Third, CO 2 utilization may be perceived more positively than CO 2 storage, which may increase public support. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 6 2 Carbon Capture Many carbon capture technologies are mature, but they have not reached widespread deployment because of high costs and the long timeline for implementation, among other challenges. Some industrial sectors have been capturing CO 2 for decades; however, costs limit the application of capture in some industrial secto rs, and more specific challenges are limiting in other sector s. Direct air capture, which has been implemented at pilot scale, is a newer concept than capturing CO 2 from point sources. Direct air capture currently incurs higher cost than point -source capture and is more technically difficult because the atmosphere has a much lower CO 2 concentration than industrial waste gas. 2.1 Status of carbon capture technology 2.1.1 Capture systems Many carbon capture technologies are ready for wider demonstration and deploy ment. A carbon capture system includes different components necessary to capture CO 2 from stationary industrial sources (point -source capture) or air (direct air capture) (see app. III for more detail). Most systems include gas separation technologies to i solate CO 2 from a mixture of gases. Point-source capture includes several approaches to capturing CO 2 from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Other approaches apply to capture of process emissions (Table 1). Table 1: Approaches for capturing carbon dioxide ( CO 2) from point sources Emissions source Capture approach CO 2 from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass Pre-combustion capture applies steam, oxygen, and pressure in a series of reactions to convert fossil fuels into hydrogen and CO 2. These gases are then separated, the CO 2 is stored or used, and the hydrogen is burned to generate electricity without CO 2 emissions. Post -combustion capture removes CO 2 from flue gas, which is a mixture of waste gases, produced by burning fuels in air. Oxyfuel combustion burns fuel in high -purity oxygen. This results in a flue gas that is mainly water vapor and CO 2, which makes it easier to separate CO 2. CO 2 from process emissions Other approaches include direct separation in cement manufacturing, which heats limestone indirectly to allow easy capture of CO 2 from process emissions.

Because it is not tied to an emission source, it can be deployed at a wide range of locations. Carbon capture systems are relatively mature technologies as measured by technology readiness level (TRL), with some systems already deployed.9 Figure 2 is a schematic of the nine TRLs. (See app. IV for DOE's definition and description of each TRL.) Within each category of carbon c apture system, the TRL may vary by industrial sector. For example, pre -combustion systems have been demonstrated at TRL 9 for the hydrogen production industry, meaning actual systems have been proven in successful operations. But for coal -fired power generation, pre - combustion capture is considered TRL 7, meaning prototypes have been demonstrated in a relevant environment. Table 2 shows the TRLs, strengths, and limitations of different carbon capture systems. 9TRLs are a scale of nine levels used to measure a technology's progress, starting with paper studies of a basic concept and ending with a technology that has proven itself in actual use in the product's operational environment. The TRL of a capture system is determined by the lowest TRL of its critical components.

For example, the pre -combustion system has reached TRL 9 for hydrogen production but has only reached TRL 7 for use with coal -fired power generation. 2.1.2 Gas separation technologies In most applications, a critical component of the capture system is the technology to separate CO 2 from other gases. There are multiple categories of gas separatio n technologies (see table 3 and app. III). The technologies within each category have different levels of maturity, strengths, and limitations, which make some more suitable for certain applications than others. For example, sorbent -based separation is particularly suited for direct air capture because of its efficacy in separating dilute gas mixtures and it can be regenerated with low heat. Although some industrial sectors are using the most mature technologies commercially or applying them in full -scale demonstrations, researchers are developing less mature technologies in parallel to enhance performance and lower costs.

There are many large point sources that could use CO 2 capture, such as power generation facilities , ethanol biorefineries, and several types of manufacturing facilities; however, only 12 facilities that combine commercial-scale carbon capture and storage were operating in the U.S. as of 2021, according to the Global CCS Institute. 10 Two additional facilities in the U.S. captured and stored CO 2 briefly, (one from 2013 to 2018 and the other from 2017 to 2020) but suspended those operations. Globally, the total capacity of the operational carbon capture and storage facilities more 10This accounted for alm ost half of the 27 facilities worldwide. The Global CCS Institute reports the number of facilities that both capture CO 2 and store it geologically. Global CCS Institute, Global Status of CCS 2021: CCS Accelerating to Net Zero (Melbourne, Australia: 2021). than doubled from 2010 to 2021, increasing from 13.3 million metric ton s of CO 2 per year to 36.6 million over that period (fig. 3). However, this capacity represents 0.1 percent of estimated human -caused CO 2 emissions in 2021. Although CO 2 separation or capture is used in some industrial sectors (e.g., bioethanol production, natural gas processing, and fertilizer production), most of those facilities currently either vent the CO 2 into the atmosphere or sell it for use that does not permanently store or retain the CO 2 for a long period. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 10 The highest CO 2 emitting sectors are not likely to deploy carbon capture widely without further demonstration. Although two commercial -scale coal -fired power facilities are retrofitted with carbon capture (TRL 9), the technology has not been demonstrated to that level for natural gas-fired faci lities. Integrating carbon capture technologies into industrial facilities is easier in sectors in which facilities have one (as opposed to multiple) sources of emissions, and waste gas streams with higher concentration and purity of CO 2. In the following four vignettes we highlight some of the sector -specific factors that influence implementation of carbon capture in select ed sectors.

Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 11 Power Generation The electric power sector is one of the two largest emitters of CO 2 in the U.S., accounting for about 30 percent of CO 2 emissions, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates. In 2021, 38 percent of U.S. electricity was generated from natural gas and 22 percent from coal. Carbon capture technologies can be included in new power generation facilities or retrofitted to existing ones. Examples of demonstration and d eployment From 199 1 to 2005, Northeast Energy Associates operated a natural gas - fired power generation facility with carbon capture in Bellingham, MA . The captured CO 2 was used in the food and beverage industry. The Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada , was the first coal-fired power facility to implement carbon capture successfully. Operational since 2014, the facility can capture up to 1 million metric tons of CO 2 per year for enhanced oil recovery and geologic storage. Operational in 2017, the Petra Nova project in Thompson, Texas , was designed to capture at least 90 percent of the CO 2 emissions from a 240 - megawatt equivalent flue gas slipstream at the W.A. Parish Electric Generating Station and to store up to 1.4 million metric tons of CO 2 annually. The captured CO 2 was compressed and transported through an 80-mile pipeline for enhanced oil recovery, which is a process that uses gases such as CO 2 to push additional oil out of an oil field once much of the easy -to-produce oil has already been recovered. The facility paused operations in May 2020 because low oil prices reduced the profitability of using captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. Challenges Design and integration of carbon capture technologies can vary based on configuration of the po wer generation facility and fuel source . The most mature technology (solvent -based system using amine) has only been deployed in a subset of possible configurations of coal- fired power generation facilities . Retrofitting a power generation facility with carbon capture can be more difficult with facilities that are older, smaller, or have little available space. High capital costs for carbon capture equipment. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 12 Cement The process of manufacturing cement from limestone releases large quantities of CO 2, known as process emissions. Cement manufacturing also relies heavily on coal for heat, resulting in additional emissions. Aside from using carbon capture technologies, there are few opportunities to reduce these emissions. Some studies suggest carbon capture techno logies could reduce emissions from cement manufacturing by 25 to 48 percent. Examples of demonstration and d eployment According to Global CCS Institute, there were no commercial cement manufacturing facilities integrated with carbon capture and storage as of 2021. Since 2015, Carbon free Chemicals has been operating a pilot-scale demonstration at a cement manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas . The company uses captured CO 2 to manufacture products such as baking soda, bleach, and hydrochloric acid. The technology has a capacity to capture 75, 000 metric tons of CO 2 from the facility, which reported around 500,000 metric tons of CO 2 emissions in 2020. In December 2020, HeidelbergCement announced its plan to install full- scale carbon capture at its Norcem cement manufacturing facility in Brevik, Norway. Capture is expected to begin in 2024 and to enable capture of up to 400,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year. Captured CO 2 will be transported by ship for temporary storage and then by pipeline to a subsea formation in the North Sea. Challenges Carbon capture in cement manufacturing has not been demonstrated at a commercial scale. U.S. cement manufacturers have limited ability to pass costs to consumers because cement manufacturing is highly competitive . Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 13 Iron and Steel The United States is the world's fourth largest producer of steel. Iron and steel manufacturing is energy intensive and emits large amounts of CO 2. Although the iron and steel industry made strides in reducing CO 2 emissions by improving ene rgy efficiency in recent decades, additional major improvements are not technically possible. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies can further reduce the carbon footprint of iron and steel manufacturing. Examples of demonstration and d eployment The first and only commercial carbon capture and storage project in the iron and steel industry is the Al Reyadah project in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It has been in operation since November 2016 and captures up to 800,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year of emissions from the direct reduced iron reactor (which removes oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing material). The captured CO 2 is used for enhanced oil recovery, which is a process that uses gases such as CO 2 to push additional oil out of an oil field once much of the easy -to-produce oil has already been recovered . Although carbon capture has been deployed in the production of direct reduced iron (an intermediate product of steelmaking) , applications to other pathways of iron and steelmaking have not been demonstrated at the same technology readiness level. Challenges U.S. iron and steel manufacturers have limited ability to pass the cost of carbon capture to consumers because prices are set by the global market. Integrating carbon capture into production processes is complex because facilities have multiple sources of emissions with different CO 2 concentrations. Design and integration of carbon capture technologies depends on the production processes used, and the most mature technology (solvent - based system using amine) has only been deployed in the iron-making process. High capital costs of carbon capture equipment. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 14 Bioethanol CO 2 is a byproduct of ethanol production from sugar -based or starch -based feedstocks. Produced during fermentation of sugars, the resulting CO 2 has high purity and requires little processing before it can be used or stored in geologic formations. Commercial technologies to capture CO 2 emissions from the fermentation process are available and have been used for many years. Examples of demonstration and d eployment According to Global CCS Institute, there were three commercial ethanol biorefineries integrated with carbon capture and storage and 34 in advanced development in the U.S. in 2021. Arkalon , in Liberal, Kansas, was the first commercial ethanol biorefinery integrated with carbon capture and storage in the U.S. and has been operational since 2009. The facility captures up to 290,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year for enhanced oil recovery. Since then, the number of ethanol biorefineries that are capturing CO 2 has increased, but most captured CO 2 is not stored geologically. As of 2021, about 50 out of 207 ethanol biorefineries in the U.S. are capturing CO 2 for sale in the food-grade CO 2 market. In 2021, Archer Daniels Midland and the University of Illinois successfully completed the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project, which captures CO 2 from an ethanol biorefinery for geologic storage. The project included the design, construction, and demonstration of a dehydration and compression facility to capture CO 2 resulting from processing corn into ethanol. The CO 2 is then injected at a nearby s ite for geological storage. Summit Agricultural Group and Navigator CO 2 Ventures have each launched a large - scale carbon capture and storage project that involves ethanol biorefineries and other facilities in the Midwest. CO 2 captured as a result of the se projects will be stored geologically in North Dakota and south -central Illinois, respectively . Challenges Many ethanol biorefineries in the Midwest are not near CO 2 storage sites. Identifying partners for transport, storage, or use of CO 2 may be challenging. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 15 2.2.2 Direct air capture Direct air capture is a newer system , introduced as an approach to climate mitigation in the late 1990s. Existing projects use a handful of gas separation technologies to capture CO 2. Direct air capture has been implemented at pilot scale, with 18 facilities operating worldwide as of April 2022. The total capacity of operational facilities has increased from less than 1,000 me tric tons of CO 2 per year in 2010 to almost 8,000 metric tons in 2021 (fig. 4). As of August 2022, the largest direct air capture facility has the capacity to capture 4,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year. By comparison, the facility with the highest capacity to capture and store CO 2 from a 11K.-M. Lee and A. Inaba, Life Cycle Assessment: Best Practices of ISO 14040 Series (Suwon Korea, Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation: 2004). point source can capture up to 7 million metric tons of CO 2 per year. Direct air capture has higher energy requirements and costs than point -source capture because the concentration of CO 2 in ambient air is relatively low (around 0.041 percent, whereas industrial flue gases are between 1 and 33 percent CO 2). Unless direct air capture is powered by low -carbon energy (e.g., nuclear, wind, solar), the CO 2 emitted from energy use may exceed the CO 2 captured by the system. Accor ding to the research literature, life cycle assessment is key to understanding whether direct air capture systems result in CO 2 benefits. Life cycle assessment is a systematic tool that allows for analysis of CO 2 emissions of a system in its entire life cycle and assessment of its impact to the environment.11 Opportunities to improve direct air capture systems include identifying materials that can be reused for thousands of cycles of air capture, optimizing processes, and avoiding conditions that accelerate material degradation. These improvements could reduce the cost of direct air capture, which is currently the most costly capture system per ton of CO 2. 2.3 Key challenges to widespread deployment The long timeline to retrofit carbon capture technologies or develop new facilities , and high costs, among other challenges, could Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 16 hinder widespread deployment in the near term. 2.3.1 Lengthy time to deployment The long timeline for deployment poses a challenge for both point-source capture and direct air capture projects to obtain investment and financing because policies and market conditions could change during or after deployment to negatively affect the return on investment. Chapter 5 provides further analysis of economic incentives. Point-source capture For sectors such as power generation, iron and steel manufacturing, and cement manufacturing, integration of carbon capture takes time because of the complexities described above. Our review of the timelines for three large -scale point - source demonstration projects (B oundary Dam and PetraNova for coal -fired power generation and Al Reyadah for iron and steel manufacturing) shows that it took 6 to 7 years from the time that a project was announced to when it became operational (fig. 5). 12 12These are first -of-a-kind projects. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 17 Although the U.S. is considered to be a leader in CCUS deployment, there are nevertheless few carbon capture and storage projects that are completed or under construction in high CO 2-emitting sectors. Although there are additional demonstrations in early and advanced development (see table 5), historically a number of projects in these stages have not reached completion. Direct air capture Direct air capture readiness timelines are less certain. It is difficult to project when direct air capture will be ready for widespread deployment given it is currently at TRL 7. Moving from a full -scale prototypical system to an actual system that works in its final form and under expected conditions could take years.

High upfront capital costs deter investments. Capital costs of integrating carbon capture systems into some of the high -CO 2 emit ting sectors (see table 6) are often cited as a challenge to deployment. For point -source capture, the total costs of capturing one metric ton of CO 2 (including capital and operating costs) are estimated to be from $40 to $290 for some high emitting sector s (fig. 6).13 In sectors where CO 2 separation is part of the industrial process (e.g., bioethanol production), costs are lower, ranging from $0 to $35 per metric ton. For direct air capture, most sources we reviewed estimated costs to be $100 to $600 per me tric ton, with one source estimating the upper bound to be $1,200.14 In addition to the initial CO 2 concentration in the gas stream, other variables affecting cost include facility size (with lower cost per ton at larger facilities), flow rate of the gas st ream, and CO 2 separation technology .

Feron, \"Techno- Economic Assessment for CO 2 Capture from Air Using a Conventional Liquid- Based Absorption Process,\" Frontiers in Energy Research, vol. 8, article 92 (2020). Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 19 Note: Each range represents estimates from a single source. Given the total costs of installing and operating carbon capture, research literature and a stakeholder group estimated that these technologies may increase the cost of related products by 10 to 90 percent. Some stakeholders raised the co ncern that they cannot pass the additional costs to consumers, since they have to compete globally with products made without carbon capture. There is not always a clear business case or profit model to integrate carbon capture into industrial facilities o r remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. Research and development is under way to reduce cost by improving performance, optimizing the carbon capture process, and developing alternatives that are cheaper and more efficient than current mature technologies. Resea rch and development can also help policymakers anticipate and mitigate environmental concerns as the technologies scale up. Demonstrations are another key way to reduce costs, as well as technical and financial uncertainties. For new technology that is advancing to commercial maturity, it is generally accepted that the first -of-a-kind commercial facility costs significantly more to build than subsequent facilities and provides limited information on operating, maintenance, and cost issues under a narrow set of conditions. \" Learning -by-doing\" at commercial scale under real -world conditions helps identify risks across a full range of conditions, optimize the system, reduce costs, and develop viable business models. The text box below describes two key attributes of successful carbon capture demonstrations. In addition, chapter 5 provides further analysis of economic incentives. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 20 Technology readiness and revenue credibility of carbon capture demonstrations Although demonstration fac ilities play a critical role in technology development, they cost a lot more than bench and pilot projects. Assessments of past demonstration projects suggest that selecting projects that have high technology readiness leve l and credible revenue streams could reduce the likelihood of spending significant funds on unsuccessful projects.a,b Technology readiness has been suggested as the reason for the failure of the Kemper project .

Oxy fuel-combustion systems have been demonstrated up to TRL 7; in contrast, the three successfully completed carbon capture and storage demonstrations funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) used more mature technologies. Demonstration projects with cr edible revenue streams and less reliance on incentives are more likely to succeed, according to Abdullah et al.a We previously found that three out of eight projects in DOE's Clean Coal Power Initiative withdrew from participating because they determined that continued participation was not economically viable.c One project specifically cited a lack of legislative and regulatory support for cost recovery that it had expected at the time of its original application to DOE, reflecting the effect of credibility of incentives. The Petra Nova project, which was successfully completed, ceased operation in 2020 because its expected revenue stream from carbon dioxide (CO 2) sales dwindled when low oil prices reduced the demand for CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. aA.

Many technologies that directly use CO 2 are mature and have been used for decades, and newer technologies that c onvert CO 2 into products are available or in development. CO 2-based products include building materials that offer permanent CO 2 storage and fuels that have large CO 2 utilization potentials. However, production costs and restrictive standards limit the viability of many CO 2-based products in the market. Furthermore, there is no agreed- upon framework for determining whether a given CO 2-based product has the intended effect of mitigating CO 2 emissions. 3.1 Status of CO 2 utilization technology Worldwide, over 230 million metric tons of CO 2 are currently used or converted to 15International Energy Agency (IEA), Putting CO 2 to Use: Creating Value from Emissions (France: IEA Publications, 2019), 6. Currently, the two largest users of CO 2 are the fertilizer industry fo r urea production (57 percent), and the oil sector for enhanced oil recovery (34 percent). Enhanced oil recovery via gas injection uses gases such as CO 2 to push additional oil out of an oil field once much of the easy -to-produce oil has already been recovered. Other users of CO 2 include the food and beverage industry, metal fabrication, and greenhouses (to stimulate plant growth). valuable products every year.15 Figure 7 shows that CO 2 utilization pathways can be sorted into two broad categories: conversion, in which CO 2 is chemically altered, and nonconversion, in which i t is not. With the exception of urea production, conversion pathways represent a small fraction of current CO 2 consumption . However, they are a growing area of interest for researchers and industry. According to one research firm, the market for CO 2-based products could grow from less than $1 billion currently to $70 billion by 2030.16 Most nonconversion pathways, including enhanced oil recovery, are mature and widely used, but outside the scope of this report.17 16L. Krishfiel d et al., CO 2 Capture & Utilization: The Emergence of a Carbon Economy (Lux Research, Inc., 2020). 17Conversion pathways that are mature and widely used, such as urea production, are also outside the scope of this report.

One priority of ongoing research is to improve conversion pathway efficiency, either through process improvements or by developing technologies that combine CO 2 capture and conversion (see text box). 3.3 CO 2 conversion products The pathways described above can be used to manufacture a variety of products. We highlight select ed examples in four vignettes: synthetic mineral aggregates, CO 2-cured concrete, commodity chemicals and fuels, and polymers.

It eliminates three intermediate steps: purifying CO 2, compressing it, and regenerating the capture medium (i.e., the solvent or sorbent used for gas separation). Reactive capture also reduces overall transportation costs because no pure CO 2 needs to be transported. Early examples of reactive capture use chemical or microbial processes to make products such as carbon nanotubes and methane. Reactive capture technologies are still relatively immature (TRL 1 -3). Further research, development, and demonstration could help address key challenges, such as flue gas impurities and mismatch between the current rate of CO 2 capture and conversion.

Most mineral aggregates currently come from mines, and a recent scientific article estimated that the global annual market was 45 billion metric tons in 2020. One primary use is in concrete, which is 60 to 80 percent mineral aggregate. Synthetic aggregates are made by mineral carbonation and can provide essentially permanent storage of CO 2 from either flue gas or pure CO 2 streams. They can also serve as disposal for other industrial wastes, such as fly ash, steel slag, and cement kiln dust. According to trade groups, a circular economy for concrete is a key step towards CO 2 emissions reduction in the building industry. For example, CO 2 captured from cement manufacturing facilities could create synthetic aggregates or could recarbonate concrete waste for recycled aggregates. Challenges Availability of the waste materials currently used as feedstocks, such as fly ash or steel slag, may decline if levels of coal mining, coal -fired power generation, or primary steel production decrease. May not be cost -competitive with mined or recycled ag gregates. May not always mitigate more CO 2 emissions than other aggregate types. For example, CO 2 emissions from transporting synthetic aggregates to a construction site might be higher than CO 2 emissions from producing recycled aggregates from construction waste. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 26 CO 2-Cured Concrete CO 2-cured concrete retains CO 2 for millions of years and may be price competitive with conventional concrete. Concrete is a mixture of aggregates, cement, and water. The curing process converts cement into interlocking crystals which bind the elements of concrete together. Though CO 2 can be mixed directly with traditional cements in a concrete mixer, fully CO 2-cured concrete uses non -traditional cements that are cured in CO 2 chambers as pre cast concrete blocks. This process can use flue gas directly, which simplifies both carbon capture and utilization. Furthermore, some demonstrations have shown that CO 2- cured concrete is stronger than traditional concrete. According to trade groups, a circular economy for concrete is a key step towards CO 2 emissions reduction in the building industry. For example, CO 2 captured from ceme nt manufacturing facilities could cure precast concrete blocks for new buildings or roads. Challenges Usually uses nontraditional cements, which may not be allowed under current prescriptive building standards. Fully CO 2-cured concrete is currently only available as precast concrete products, which is a small portion of the global concrete market (approximately 30 percent). Quantification of CO 2 benefits for CO 2- cured concrete is difficult, and independent life cycle assessments have not confirmed that it results in an overall net reduction in emissions. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 27 Commodity Chemicals and Fuels Commodity Chemicals Certain carbon containing chemicals can be made from captured CO 2 instead of fossil fuels, thereby reducing emissions. Examples of CO 2-based commodity chemicals include urea, methanol, salicylic acid, and ethylene. Alcohols such as methanol or ethanol can be made from CO 2 through either chemical or microbial conversion pathways and then converted into many commodity chemicals using conventional processes. CO 2-based formic acid and methane could also serve as gateways to certain commodity chemicals. Fuels Fuels have a large CO 2 utilization potential due to their vast market size, according to multiple estimates. Fuels can either be gases or liquids, including methane, methanol, and gasoline. While energy sources such as electricity or hydrogen fuel cells could decarbonize cars, CO 2-based fuels could be used for sectors that are harder to decarbonize, such as aviation and maritime transportation. CO 2-based fuels are drop -in solutions that have the same energy density as existing fuels and, unlike electricity and hydrogen, do not present a major need for new infrastructure. Challenges CO 2 is retained for less than 1 year for fuels and for up to 10 years for most commodity chemicals. Greater availability of CO 2-derived chemicals and fuels could lead to increased consumption of those resources, which may divert CO 2 from products with longer retention times, such as building materials. The use of CO 2-based methanol as a gateway to other chemicals would require large amounts of additional infrastructure to deliver necessary inputs (e.g., electricity, hydrogen, and CO 2) to produce CO 2-based commodity chemicals at current global scales. CO 2-based fuels may not qualify for some incentives, and thus may not be able to compete with other fuels that do. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 28 Polymers CO 2-based polymers are at commercial scale, cost less to make than the selling price of conventional, and can retain CO 2 for tens to hundreds of years. Polymers are the basis of many modern materials, including plastics, foams, and resins. For polymers such as polyols and polycarbonates, it is possible to replace some fossil fuel -based feedstock with CO 2 during manufacture. CO 2-based polyols are currently used in the production of polyurethane, which in turn is used to make products such as foam mattresses, low -impact sports floors, and foams for cars. CO 2-based polycarbonate production is also safer than conventional polycarbonate production because it avoids the use of a toxic chemical. There are multiple ways for polymers to be incorporated into a circular economy. In addition to traditional mechanical recycling, plastics could be chemically recycled to recover polymer feedstocks or burned as fuel with the resulting CO 2 captured and reused to make new polymers. Challenges Production of polycarbonate polyols currently occurs at smaller scale than conventionally produced polymers. Thou gh polymers are high value materials, they have smaller market potential than some commodity chemicals or fuels. Fossil fuel -based feedstocks would still be needed for 50 to 80 percent of polymer production. Other types of nonpolyol CO 2-based polymers are still in the research phase. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 29 Looking forward: Elemental carbon materials Technologies that convert carbon dioxide (CO 2) to elemental carbon products\u2014 such as carbon fiber, carbon nanotubes, and diamonds\u2014 are emerging as an area of interest. Some of these products are starting to enter the market, but face technical challenges related to scalability and the use of energy intensive reaction conditions. Source: GAO analysis of scientific literature . | GAO -22-105274 3.4 Challenges to deployment of CO 2 conversion technologies We identified three near -term challenges to scaling up technologies for CO 2 conversion: many products are not currently price - competitive, they may not be allowed under current relevant standards, and life cycle assessments are needed to ensure that production results in reduction or avoidance of CO 2 emissions. 3.4.1 Many products are not price - competitive Many CO 2-based products are not currently price -competitive with their conventional 19Polyol polymers, algae- based nutraceuticals, electrochemically produced carbon monoxide, and CO 2-mixed concrete have lower estimated costs of production compared to conventional product sellin g price. counterparts in the market. Building materials have low selling prices and low profit margins, which makes it difficult for CO 2-based materials to com pete. Although CO 2-cured concrete can have a lower cost of production than the selling price of conventional concrete, the cost of transportation could eliminate any competitive advantage. Some CO 2-based products cost less to produce than the conventional product selling price.19 However, others such as CO 2-based commodity chemicals and fuels, currently have higher production costs than the selling price of their conventional counterparts. There are two main factors contributing to the high production costs of CO 2-based Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 30 chemicals and fuels. The first is the need for abundant, inexpensive low -carbon energy for chemical conversion, which can account for 40 to 70 percent of production costs.20 CO 2 conversion pathways that do not use low - carbon energy sources may result in net life - cycle increases in CO 2 emissions instead of reductions. While reports predict that on -grid renewable energy will be less expensive in the future, other uses of this energy may prove more efficient at CO 2 emissions reduction than CO 2-based chemical production.21 See the text box for possible ways to address electricity costs for CO 2 conversion technology. 20These data are based on actual production of CO 2-based methanol and methane and estimated from a recent study of many other products. A second reason for the high production costs of chemical conversion technologies is that many conversion pathways require clean hydrogen to prevent additional CO 2 emissions. Production of clean hydrogen emits little to no CO 2 but can be expensive. One pos sible way to address this issue is to integrate chemical conversion technologies into clean hydrogen hubs (see text box). 21For example, see IEA, Putting CO 2 to Use , 44; C. Hepburn et al., \"The technological and economic prospects for CO 2 utilization and removal,\" Nature , vol. 575 (2019): 91; and A. K\u00e4telh\u00f6n et al., \"Climate change mitigation potential of carbon capture and utilization in the chemical industry,\" PNAS , vol. 116, no. 23 (2019). Electricity cost solutions We identified two possible approaches that may help to reduce the effects of electricity cost on the cost of carbon dioxide ( CO 2) chemical conversion. The first is building chemical conversion facilities near a low -carbon electricity source, a low- cost clean source of hydrogen, and an appropriate CO 2 gas stream. A few international facilities producing CO 2-based methanol or methane have had financial success with this approach. The second approach, known as \"power -to-X,\" is to use off -grid renewable energy such as wind or solar to produce resources that store the energy in a more transportable state. These resources could include methane (\"power -to- methane\" or or \"power -to-liquids\"). According to an academic researcher, synthetic liquid fuels could transport more energy through pipelines than a power line while avoid ing intermittency issues currently associated with renewable energy.

Current ly, the most common way to produce hydrogen also emits CO 2. In a clean hydrogen hub, the CO 2 emitted from this process could be captured and combined with the clean hydrogen to produce ethanol, plastics, or sustainable aviation fuel. Another way to generate clean hydrogen \u2014known as water electrolysis \u2014also generates oxygen, which is currently emitted as waste. This process is expensive, but a market for oxygen could provide an additional source of revenue. For example, oxygen from water electrolysis could be used for oxyfuel combustion carbon capture (see ch. 2). Figure 8 illustrates the integration between hydrogen production, carbon capture, and CO 2 conversion that could exist at a clean hydrogen hub. aInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L.

Furthermore, private companies could also institute their own version of procurement policies through purchase agreements. For example, one U.S.-based airline recently made a formal commitment to purchase 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel made from CO 2 conversion pathways over the next 20 years. 3.4.2 Current standards may exclude CO 2- based products Products resulting from CO 2 conversion may not be allowed under current common standards. These standards are often prescriptive \u2014requiring, for example, that the materials in concrete mixtures be used in specific proportions like a recipe. Concrete may not meet these standards if it is cured using CO 2 instead of water. In contrast, performance-based standards are based on the characteristics of building materials, such as compressive strength. Performance standards for concrete exist and may allow for the use of CO 2-based concrete, but are less common because they can be harder to verify. Similarly, e xperts told us that existing standards for fuels may not equally incentivize all CO 2 reduction strategies. For example, algal biofuel qualifies as an 23The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes an appropriation to the Administrator of the EPA for administrative costs to develop and carry out a program to identify and label construction materials and products that have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a7 60116, 136 Stat. at 2077-78. 2442 U.S.C. \u00a7 aviation standard is the International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for advanced biofuel under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), while CO 2-based fuels made from non-biologi cal sources of CO 2 do not.24 Stakeholders told us that the RFS and an international standard for aviation fuel can be barriers to CO 2-based fuels deployment.25 Creation and adoption of technology -neutral standards \u2014standards based on desired outcomes rather than specific metrics or processes\u2014 could lead to incentivizing whichever technology results in the best CO 2 benefits with the fewest costs. For example, low-carbon fuel standards can incentivize innovation in alternative fuel development by requiring fuels to meet CO 2 emissions targets in a specific time frame instead of specifying a source material.26 3.4.3 Lack of standardized life cycle assessment guidelines There is a lack of agreed-upon guidelines for determining whether a given CO 2-based product has the intended effect of mitigating CO 2 emissions. L ife cycle assessments can serve as a framework to measure the net CO 2 benefits of a conversion process. However, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), current life cycle assessment guidance from t he International Standards Organization (ISO) 14000 series does not adequately account for considerations specific to CO 2 conversion, such as retention of CO 2 within International Av iation, or CORSIA. Currently, only waste CO 2 converted to ethanol by microbial conversion then to aviation fuel (\"alcohol -to-jet\") qualifies. 26The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 establishes tax credits to incentivize production of clean fuels inclu ding sustainable aviation fuels with a broade r definition than the RFS. \u00a7 13 203, 136 Stat. at 1932-35. The tax credit is not a mandat ory standard. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 33 the product.27 Some organizations have proposed updated life cycle assessment guidelines fo r CO 2 utilization, but they have not yet been widely adopted. The wide variety of CO 2-based products on the market makes it challenging to establish a common method of analyzing life cycle emissions. In addition, it is not clear how to estimate the result ing emissions reduction because it is also difficult to estimate CO 2 emissions for the conventional products that would be replaced.28 Without clear guidance 27Some current life cycle assessment guidelines prescribe the use of a constant 100 -year period for determining CO 2 emissions. While this would not affect products such as CO 2- based building materials that store CO 2 for millions of years, products that retain CO 2 for less than 100 years, such as CO 2- based alcohols and fuels would need to account for the release of the CO 2 back into the atmosphere. addressing these points of variability, determination of emissions reduction will be conducted on a subjective, case -by-case basis by (or on behalf of) the company seeking a life cycle assessment of their product. Reports and experts have described several desirable characteristics of a standardized life cycle assessment process. They include transpare ncy, clear sets of assumptions on input data, clear system boundaries, and a clear comparative reference for each product type. 28For example, methanol is currently produced from a range of pathways, including natural gas reforming and coal gasification, which have different levels of associated CO 2 emissions. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 34 3.5 Policy o ptions Technology -neutral standards. Policymakers could encourage the creation, adoption, or use of technology -neutral standards (e.g., performance based building standards, low -carbon fuel standards). This policy option could address the exclusion of CO 2-based products by current standards. Potential implementation approaches: For building materials, encourage the use of performance -based standards in construction. For fuels, encourage the creation of state or federal standards based on the desired outcome (CO 2 emissions reduction) rather than feedstock, technology, or other contributing fac tors. Opportunities Considerations By rewarding outcomes instead of specific technologies, technology -neutral standards could incentivize the development or use of products with the best CO 2 benefits. Could incentivize manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. For building materials, federally acknowledged performance -based standards could assist state agencies in charge of implementation. Standards development is a resource- intensive and lengthy process. Without standardized life cycle assessments, it could be difficult to compare net CO 2 benefits of different products. To ensure performance- based standards are met, materials need to be assessed, which is more complicated than following a prescribed recipe. Predictive models may be necessary to determine the performance of CO 2-based materials in the far -term. Standardized life cycle assessment guideline s. Policymakers could support the creation and use of standardized life cycle assessment guidelines to validate CO 2 benefits of CO 2-based produc ts. This policy option could address the lack of standardized life cycle assessment guidelines . Opportunities Considerations Could improve accuracy of comparisons between various CO 2 utilization pathways or products. Standards development and life cycle assessment are resource -intensive and lengthy processes. Coordination of many stakeholders to establish standardized life cycle assessment guidelines may be challenging. As many CO 2-based products are globally traded, it may be necessary but challenging to reach a global consensus on optimal life cycle assessment guidelines.

Carbon capture does not reduce emissions or remove CO 2 if it is vented back into the atmosphere rather than stored or used. Although many of the necessary technologies are mature, including those for transporting and storing CO 2, the CCUS industry is in its infancy. Scale -up would require an increase in capture, pipeline, and storage infrastructure \u2014each of which can take years to develop. Several intertwining challenges can affect the cost and feasibility of this scale -up, including timing, negotiating with landowners for access, and the proximity of capture f acilities to storage sites. 4.1 Transport Pipelines are the most common and least expensive way to transport large volumes of 29Other methods of transporting CO 2, such as by truck, rail or ship, m ay be viable for small volumes or short distances. Transporting large volumes of CO 2 by truck or rail is not economical. Transportation by ship is not widely deployed, but is more economical than pipelines for transporting small volumes across large bodies of water. CO 2, but the majority of current infrastructure supports enhanced oil recovery using CO 2 from underground, not from carbon capture.29 As of 2020, the U.S. had over 5,000 miles of CO 2 pipeline, according to the most recent data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Material s Safety Administration ( PHMSA). To achieve widespread deployment of CCUS, several reports indicate that the U.S. would need tens of thousands of additional miles of CO 2 pipeline infrastructure.30 Although these pipelines are a mature technology and have been used safely at a commercial-scale in the U.S. since 1972, a recent accident prompted PHMSA to announce new measures to strengthen its safety oversight of CO 2 pipelines.31 Figure 9 shows the current locations of CO 2 pipelines in the U.S. and example estimates of future pipeline needs. 30E.

Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 36 CO 2 pipeline transportation costs will generally decrease as the capacity of the pipeline increases. According to a 2020 report, transporting CO 2 through a network of large, shared pipelines would be less expensive per ton than transporting it through many smaller pipelines that connect individual facilities to storage opportunities. 32 CO 2 pipeline infrastructure can take years to develop. States regulate the siting of pipelines on nonfederal lands, and their requirements for siting approval vary. When a propo sed CO 2 pipeline crosses federal land, it triggers a National Environmental P olicy Act review, which prolongs the development process.33 32Great Plains Institute, Transport Infrastructure for Car bon Capture and Storage . 33On February 16, 2022, the Council on Environmental Quality issued interim guidance encouraging agencies to facilitate efficient, orderly, and responsible deployment of CCUS projects, including developing programmatic reviews under the 4.2 Storage The U.S. has abundant potential geologic storage opportunities for CO 2, but in some regions this potential stora ge may not be practical to develop for various reasons, including technical limitations and lack of economic viability. Developing these storage sites can take several years and millions of dollars per site. Saline formations account for more than 95 percent of potential storage, according to DOE. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are less abundant but are already well understood. 34 (See fig. 10 for a map of potential storage opportunities .) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

CO 2 storage in these formations is generally considered to be safe and secure when a storage facility is carefully sited and operated. Naturally occurring CO 2 has remained trapped underground for millions of years. Industrial - scale projects have successfully injected or stored CO 2 underground in geologic formations since the 1970s. Combined experience from successful commercial and resear ch projects and naturally trapped CO 2 provide evidence that underground geologic storage of CO 2 can be safe, secure, and 35T.

S. costs less than $10 per ton of CO 2, but storage costs can vary significantly (see fig. 11). Cost depends on the location and characteristics of each storage site, including the number of wells needed, the depth of the underground storage formation, and what the land around the storage site is already used for . Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 38 Projects seeking to inject CO 2 into formations for permanent storage are subject to EPA's Class VI Rule and must obtain a Class VI permit.36 Although some stakeholders expressed concern over the time it took past developers to receive a Class VI permit, others told us that this timeline will improve now that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has authorized additional funding for EPA permitting of Class VI wells and a grant program for state enforcement. 37 As of 2022, EPA had issued permits for two active Class VI 36Class VI wells are used to inject CO 2 into deep rock formations for long -term storage.

Reg. 77230 (Dec. 10, 2010) , referred to as the Class VI Rule , which established requirements to protect underground sources of drinking water from long -term storage injection wells, which took at least 3 years per permit. Interest in permits has increased, with 25 permit applications pending as of August 2022. EPA officials told us they are streamlining the permitting process. While there are many factors that influen ce permitting timeframes, EPA officials anticipate that prospective owners or operators submitting complete Class VI applications will be issued permits in approximately 2 years. 38 of CO 2.

It can take years to plan, permit, and build infrastructure for capturing, transporting, and storing CO 2 (see fig. 12). Developing this infrastructure in parallel rather than in sequence could accelerate deployment of the CCUS industry as a whole, according to stakeholders. aSite screening, selection, and characterization can take more than 4 years. Class VI permits, which took less than 1 year each. However, we did not examine whether Class VI primacy could e xpedite the permitting process more generally . Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 40 4.3.2 Negotiating private land access Generally, developers must negotiate land access for both transportation and storage infrastructure, which can be costly. Transport and storage developers may have to negotiate with hundreds to thousands of land owners, depending on location and the distance between the captur e and storage sites.39 These negotiations can be complicated for storage developers in states that have not explicitly defined who owns the underground pore space where CO 2 is injected. The majority of states do not have a regulatory framework for geologic CO 2 storage.40 Fewer than half have defined pore - space rights. Furthermore, only a few allow unitization for CO 2 storagea process that allows operators to proceed with inj ection after reaching agreement with a minimum percentage of owners, rather than all landowners. Industry stakeholders and an expert said that unitization is a key tool for developing CO 2 storage projects in large areas, using the underground pore space efficiently, and ensuring that landowners benefit in an equitable way. 39Developing CCUS projects on public land could reduce negotiations. In February of 2022 , the Wh ite House issued a press release listing actions to support CCUS deployment including the Department of the Interior working to establish safeguards for geologic sequestration on federally managed lands. In June of 2022, Interior issued an Instruction Memo randum conveying policy and direction for authorizing rights -of-way to use public lands for CCUS projects. This included authorizing the use of pore space managed by the Bureau of Land Management, even when the surface facilities are owned by a separate en tity. 4.3.3 Proximity of capture facilities to storage sites The distance between capture facilities and storage sites affects the cost and feasibility of transporting CO 2. Transportation costs are lower when capture facilities are co -located with storage. The majority of point -source emitters in the U.S. are within 30 miles of a potential geologic storage site according to IEA; however, not every potential site will be technically or commercially feasible. In such cases, emitters may need to pay more to transport CO 2 longer distances to storage sites that have already been established. A 2021 report estimated that with wider deployment, the majority of combined U.S. transpo rt and storage costs by 2050 could be $40 or less per ton of CO 2, with an average cost of $17-23 per ton of CO 2 (see fig. 13).41 40R.

According to 42Shared infrastructure can also present challenges. For example, shutting down or restricting shared pipeline the IEA, 15 percent of point-source emissions in the U.S. come from sources that are not near a potential geologic storage site. These emitters could reduce their CO 2 transport costs by using networks of shared, larger pipelines ( see fig. 14 for a summary of CO 2 pipeline networks) . operation would affect multiple emitters, according to agency officials. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 42 CCUS \"hubs\" are another example of shared infrastructure that connect the components of the CCUS industry (see text box) . They allow emitters that are concentrated near potential geologic storage sites to parti cipate in CCUS without needing to develop their own transport and storage infrastructure, while providing several sources of CO 2 for transport and storage developers. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 43 Hubs Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) hubs include central carbon dioxide (CO 2) collection or distribution points that share common infrastructure. Such hubs could help accelerate widespread deployment of CCUS, according to experts and reports. Some organizations have started identifying regions in the U. S. that could be suitable for hubs.a These regions have industrial facilities concentrated near potential geologic storage sites, along with other qualities such as ample energy production and commodity transportation infrastructure. Figure 15 presents an example of potential hub locations from one study. Potential benefits of hubs: Allow CCUS projects to share infrastructure and operation costs. Decrease investment risks. Make it easier for small -volume CO 2 capture projects to participate. Streamline planning and regulatory efforts; reduce negotiations with landowners. Minimize infrastructure impacts on the environment and communities. Potential drawback: Increase project lead time because the development of hubs can be complex. aFor example, see: Grea t Plains Institute, An Atlas of Carbon and Hydrogen Hubs for United States Decarbonization (2022); Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, \"The CCUS Hub\" https://ccushub.ogci.com/ccus- -22-105274 Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 44 4.5 Policy o ptions Framework for land access. Policymakers could support development of legal or regulatory frameworks to manage geologic storage of CO 2 at the state level. This policy option could help address the challenge of lengthy negotiations for land access. Potential implementation approaches: Clarify state pore -space ownership rights. Consider pore -space unitization processes for geologic storage of CO 2, which would allow storage projects to proceed through agreements with some minimum percentage of landowners. Opportunities Considerations Legal or regulatory clarity could facilitate more rapid deployment of commercial -scale CO 2 storage infrastructure. Pore -space unitization processes for geologic storage of CO 2 could reduce the time and cost of negotiating land access for storage projects. Individual landowners may oppose losing certain property rights due to pore -space unitization. CO 2 storage projects may cross state boundaries, so legal or regulatory frameworks established at the state level would likely require coordination between states or with federal agencies, which may have different goals or structures. Strategic siting. Policymakers could facili tate strategic siting of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) facilities. This policy option could help address the challenges affecting infrastructure development. Opportunities Considerations Strategic siting of infrastructure could minimize financial and logistical barriers to CCUS development. Carbon capture and utilization industries could accelerate deployment if access to necessary infrastructure increases. Certain geographic regions that are inherently more suited for CCUS could benefit more than others from strategic infrastructure investments. Some communities may not want CCUS infrastructure. Project costs and community acceptance can vary depending on the level of involvement of various types of stakeholders in siting (e.g., industry, government, nonprofit).

Some incentives that do exist, such as federal tax credits, have helped address the high cost of carbon capture in some industries that emit CO 2. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified some existing incentives for CCUS and created new ones.43 However, if decision makers would like to pursue widespread deployment, additional modifications to other incentives could further improve the economic and financial conditions for CCUS projects. 5.1 Economic and financial conditions for CCUS For emitting facilities that could use point - source capture, deploying CCUS technology is an added cost to doing business that offers few opportunities to generate offsetting revenue. Currently, there is a small commercial market for CO 2\u2014for example, for enhanced oil recovery, fertilizer production, and the food and beverage industry \u2014and a growing interest in CO 2 conversion. Existing CCUS projects have largely been limited to sectors where the cost of capture was low and the captured CO 2 could be sold for use in enhanced oil recovery. All but one of the 12 operational CCUS projects in the U.S. earn revenue from the sale of CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. However, current demand is too small to incentivize more widespread deployment of CCUS technologies. 43E.g., Pub. L. No. 117 Stat. 1818, 1924 -29, 2003 -13, 2083. Direct air capture systems are not tied to a facility that produces a conventional product, such as electricity or cement. Companies active in this nascent area are exploring possible revenue streams . These include selling CO 2 removal as a service to businesses or individuals interested in offsetting their emissions , either directly or through voluntary carbon markets, or selling captured CO 2 to utilization companies. Similarly, there is little incentive to expand transportation and storage of CO 2. Existing CO 2 pipelines in the U.S. were primarily constructed to transport CO 2 for use in enhanced oil recovery; however , the majority of this CO 2 is extracted from underground rather than from carbon capture. Storing CO 2 does not generate revenue without financial drivers. Table 9 summarizes the costs for carbon capture, transport, and storage per unit of CO 2. For sectors where capture is costly (e.g., power generation, iron and steel manufacturing), the cost of capture is the dominant factor infl uencing the overall cost of CCUS. For sectors where capture is relatively inexpensive (e.g., bioethanol production), the costs of transport and storage are a greater consideration. CCUS costs would likely decrease with more widespread deployment. The exper ience of implementing a technology at commercial scale under real-world conditions would help identify risks, optimize the system, and Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 46 develop viable business models. Studies have estimated that learning -by-doing could reduce capture costs. One report est imated learning -by-doing could reduce costs by half by mid -century under certain assumptions. Table 9: Summary of carbon capture, transport, and storage cost per unit of CO 2 Component Cost range per metric ton of CO 2 Cost factors Capture $0-$35 (sectors where CO 2 separation is part of the industrial process) $40- $290 ( high -emitting point sources) $100- $600 (direct air capture) CO 2 separation technology used Concentration of CO 2 in the gas stream Facility size (larger facilities h ave lower cost per metric ton) Flow rate of the gas stream Transport Less than $10 to more than $20 Distance between capture and storage/use sites Pipeline capacity Storage $5-$20 Location and characteristics of storage site (e.g., depth, number of wells needed) Source: GAO analysis of peer -reviewed articles and other literature. | GAO -22-105274 Note: Costs are quoted from the literature not adjusted for inflation and are averaged over a project's operational lifetime. The lack of economic return for many CCUS projects has affected the success of capture facilities and limited their deployment. We recently found that the DOE's investment of $1.1 billion on nine large CCUS demonstration projects from 2010 to 2017 resulted in varying levels of success. 44 Projects implemented at coal facilities were generally less successful than those at other industrial facilities, largely due to external factors that affected their economic viability. Other economic disincentives for wider CC US deployment include risk to early adopters and difficulty attracting private investment. Companies may be reluctant to invest in early CCUS projects because of the possibility that 44GAO, Carbon Capture and Storage: Actions Needed to Improve DOE Management of Demonstration Projects, GAO- 22- 105111 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 20, 2021). 45National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, The Power of Change: Innovation for Development and Deployment of Increasingly Clean Electric Power Technologies (Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press, 2016). competitors will benefit from the knowledge gained from those projects. Often, the knowledge gained from early research, development , and deployment benefits others and not the implementing company that undertook the greater risk.45 In addition, CCUS projects often require significant upfront investment , but developers cannot access certain financing instruments that are available to other infrastructure projects. For example, they are not eligible to take tax advantage through Master Limited Partnerships.46 46Master Limited Partnerships are public ly listed limited partnerships focused on natural -resource -related activities that trade on a national securities exchange. They are structured so as not to be subject to corporate taxation. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 47 5.2 Key current incentives Despite the small market that currently exists for CO 2, several policies and market -based approaches are in place that may help incentivize CCUS deployment (see table 10). These include federal tax credits, state policies such as California's L ow Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), and voluntary carbon markets. However, multiple factors limit the ability of companies to take full advantage of each of these approaches, according to economic studies, experts, and other stakeholders.

The act provides credits for sequestration of any type of carbon oxide, such as carbon monoxide which unlike CO 2 is not a significant greenhouse gas. 5.2.1 CCUS tax credits Federal tax credits, including sections 45Q and 48A of the Internal Revenue Code, are financial incentives currently in place that can encourage investment in CCUS projects (see below). These credits can reduce the cost to the dev eloper of investing in a project, but reliance on such credits has limitations. Section 45Q grants a credit for each metric ton of qualified CO 2 (or other carbon oxide) captured and stored.47 The 2018 revision increased the dollar amount per metric ton of qualified CO 2, among other changes.48 For example, for projects with dedicated storage (i.e., not enhanced oil recovery), the credit value in 2020 was $23.82 for equipment placed in service before the revision. The 2020 credit value for these projects was $31.77 for equipment placed in service on or after the revision and was to increase to $50 by 2026, after which it was to be adjusted for inflation. In January 2021, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding 45Q, providing clarification on the use of the tax credit. Those changes, along with others, were expected to stimulate additional investments in CC US projects, and a number of projects have been announced since the Internal Revenue Service issued the final regulations (fig. 16). According to stakeholders, the 2018 changes to 45Q 48Other changes included (1) adding a start -of-construction deadline and 12 -year claim period; (2) eliminating the 75 million metric ton cap; (3) allowing the credit for CO 2 utilizat ion in addition to enhanced oil recovery and direct air capture; (4) allowing smaller facilities to claim the credit; and (5) allowing owners of carbon capture equipment to claim tax credits instead of the person capturing the CO 2, which creates flexibilit y in ownership structures facilitating tax- equity investment .

However, reliance on ta x credits increases government tax expenditures (i.e., revenue losses attributable to provision of a tax credit). For example, according to Department of the Treasury estimates, using the 45Q levels from the 2018 revision the total tax expenditures for 45Q were expected to be approximately $9.9 billion from 2021 to 2030. Another peer-reviewed study based on the 2018 45Q levels estimated that the expenditures could be $1 to $2.3 billion (in 2018 dollars) per year by 2030. These expenditures could be higher w ith the 2022 increase of 45Q levels, depending on the extent of future CCUS project deployment. 50Nation al Petroleum Council, \"Chapter three - Policy, Regulatory and Legal Enablers,\" Meeting the Dual Challenge: A Roadmap to At -Scale Deployment of Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (Washington, D.C.: March 2021). 51S.

In addition, higher levels of financial incentives might increase extraction and use of fossil fuels if companies use the incentives to expand production. For example, a higher level of 45Q tax credit could reduce the effects of CCUS deployment if the emission- increasing effect of additional production is above the emission -reducing effect from carbon capture.52 Several factors affected the a pplicability of the 2018 revision of the 45Q tax credit, according to literature and stakeholders, most of which were addressed by the Inflation Reduction Act (see table 11). 52Q.

Under the 2018 revision to the 45Q tax credit, rec ipients often had to participate in tax e quity financing wherein an investor provides capital to a developer in exchange for tax credits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for a method of direct pay. See Pub. L. No. 117 -169, \u00a7 13801 , 136 Stat. 1818, 2003- 13. These fa ctors include the following: Access for smaller facilities. According to stakeholders and reports, the lack of a direct pay mechanism and the capture requirement in the 2018 revision of 45Q limited access for smaller facilities. 45Q tax credits were non -refundable and direct pay was not included in the 2018 revision. Therefore, smaller facilities may have had difficulty taking advantage of the tax credit if they did not have a large annual tax liability. Smaller facilities could also not access the 2018 revision of 45Q if they did not meet the capture requirement. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 al lows direct payment for certain 45Q credits and decreased the capture Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 51 capacity requirement for qualified facilities.53 Value of the credit. The 2018 value of the credit helped incentivize CCUS deployment primarily in sectors with low capture costs. For exam ple, one study examined 563 industrial facilities and found that $50 per metric ton of CO 2 would cover the cost of deployment in 24 facilities where capture costs were lowest.54 At the 2018 level, studies expected CCUS deployment to increase in sectors with lower capture costs (the \"low hanging fruit\") but not in more costly sectors, such as power generation. One study projected that the credit level would need to be $66 per metric ton to cover the costs of retrofitting coal facilities and $142 per metric to n to cover the costs for CO 2 capture at certain natural gas -fired power generation facilities.55 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 increased the value of the credit up to $85 per ton for point -source capture facilities that meet certain requirements and u p to $180 per ton for direct air capture facilities that meet those requirements.

See B. Tarufelli, B. Snyder, and D. Dismukes, \"The Potential Impact of the U.S. Carbon Capture and Storage Tax Credit Expansion on the Economic Feasibility of Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage,\" Energy Policy, vol. 149 ( 2021): 112064. commence construction deadline of January 1, 2026, in the 2018 revision was insufficient for large CCUS projects. These projects generally require a long lead time for planning, conducting front -end engineering studies, and getting permits. Some past projects have taken longer than 5 years from announcement to beginning operations. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires construction to commence prior to January 1, 2033. 56 Claim period. According to stakeholders and experts, the claim period of 12 years for the credit is insufficie nt to pay back the investment in a CCUS project, given the potential operating lifetime of a facility. One s takeholder group we interviewed said that period could be sufficient to pay back the capital investment, but likely not enough of an incentive for continued operations. For comparison, the global average retirement age of coal-fired power generation facilities is 46 years. Some of the early natural gas processing capture and storage facilities have been operating since the 1970s and 1980s. However, extending the claim period would increase tax expenditures. 57 Section 48A provides a federal tax credit that is equal to 20 percent of the qualified 55J. J. Anders on et al., \"A Techno- Economic Assessment of Carbon- Sequestration Tax Incentives in the U.S. Power Sector.\" International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, vol. 111 (2021): 103450. 56Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub.

Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 52 investment for certain kinds of coal -fired power generation projects up to $800 million,58 and 15 or 30 percent for other advanced, coal -fired power generation technologies including CCUS, with limits of $500 million or $1.2 billion respectively. Unlike 45Q, under which credits are claimed each year over a set period, 48A tax credits are available the year qualifyi ng equipment is placed into service. CCUS project developers also face challenges in using the 48A tax credit, according to several studies. Outdated efficiency requirement. To be eligible for 48A, advanced coal projects need to meet requirements related to a minimum percentage of total CO 2 emissions level sequestered, efficiency requirements, and certain pollutants. However, existing coal-fired power generation units retrofitted with carbon capture cannot meet the efficiency requirement, because electric ity and steam are needed to power the capture equipment requires energy, thus reducing the efficiency below what is required for the credit. Limited to coal. Section 48A is only available to coal -based projects. 58Integrated gasification combined cycle projects use gas and steam turbines to produce electricity, most commonly using coal as the carbon -based fuel. For more information, see National Energy Technology Lab, \"Commercial Power production Based on Gasificati on,\" accessed July 22, 2022, https://netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/igcc . 59States with existin g low- carbon fuel standards (also called clean fuel standards) include California, Oregon, and 5.2.2 Market- based approaches Participation in car bon markets, either regulatory or voluntary, is another option for improving the economic viability of CCUS projects. Carbon markets allow investors and companies to offset their emissions by trading carbon credits. Carbon credits are generated from emissi ons reduction or removal activities, including some CCUS projects, and verified by a government crediting mechanism or an independent standard - setting organization. They can be used to meet the compliance requirements or to meet an organization's pledge to voluntarily reduce emissions. California's LCFS is an example of a market- based approach that can incentivize carbon capture and storage projects. It has an established market for credits that can be traded to meet California's fuel standards. 59 According to the California Air Resources Board, the LCFS encourages the use of cleaner, low -carbon transportation fuels in California by using life cycle assessments to estimate carbon intensity standards for fuels, and the standards reduce over time. To meet the fuel standards, fuel producers and providers in California must annually balance the credits from low -carbon fuels with the \"deficits\" from fossil fuels. 60 Fuels associated with carbon capture and storage (e.g., Washington. States that have considered a low- carbon fuel standard include C olorado, New Mexico, and New York. 60To achieve the reduction in carbon intensity, fuel providers in California can change production processes to decrease the carbon intensity of fuels they produce, purchase credits from other fuel providers, and use credits generated in previous years, among other options. For more information, see California Air Resources Board, \"Low Carbon Fuel Standard,\" accessed bioethanol with carbon capture and storage) and sold in California are eligible for these credits. Direct air capture projects anywhere in the world can generate credits. The average price for an LCFS credit was approximately $193 per credit between 2019 and 2021 but declined to $125 in May 2022. LCFS credits can be combined with 45Q, providing an additional incentive for CCUS projects. Carbon capture and storage companies may have difficulty accessing the LCFS market due to uncertainty in credit prices and capacity constraints of both regulators and companies. According to one expert from our meeting, it can be difficult for companies to get financing based on LCFS because of the variability in prices. The California Air Resources Board had to spend considerable time developing carbon -intensity benchmarks using life cycle assessment. They have also had to redo a lot of the life cycle assessment work submitted by companies, according to an expert. Companies need the capacity to conduct life cycle assessment, ensure third -party verification of carbon cap ture and storage protocols, and comply with annual reporting requirements. Voluntary carbon markets can also incentivize CCUS; however, several factors 61There are two mechanisms for explicit carbon pricing by government policy: (1) a carbon tax, or (2) a cap -and- trade program. There is an extensive economic literature examining the effects, advantages, limitations, and designs of these two mechanisms. For example, see R. N. Stavins. \"The Relative Merits of Carbon Pricing Instruments: Taxes versus Trading,\" Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, vol. 16, no. 1 (2022): 62- 82. Prior GAO reports have also described carbon pricing and carbon trading in general. For example, see GAO, Climate Change: Expert Opinion on the Econom ics of Policy Options to Address Climate Change , GAO- 08-605 (Washington, D.C.: May 9, 2008). affect the ability of CCUS projects to participate in such markets. Half of the credits came from independent crediting standards organizations in the carbon crediting market in 2020. Price ranges depend on market demand and buyers' preferences for the different types of projects that can generate credits (e.g., reforestation or direct air capture). The val ue of credits averaged around a few dollars as of 2021 and fluctuates with market conditions. At current prices, selling carbon credits alone is an insufficient incentive to deploy CCUS projects. Additionally, it is difficult to verify emissions reduction or removal from CCUS projects in voluntary carbon markets due to a lack of standards. According to the experts from our meeting, current carbon crediting standards do not include standards for carbon storage with the exception of using captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. An alliance of organizations is advancing carbon accounting methodologies to enable verification of emissions reduction or removal from CCUS projects in voluntary carbon markets. 5.3 Carbon pricing mechanisms Carbon pricing is an additional instrument available to incentivize CCUS.61 Though there is no federal carbon pricing in the U.S., parts Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 54 of the U.S. have carbon pricing through cap - and-trade programs, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern U.S., and California 's Cap -and -Trade Program. Economic literature indicates that carbon pricing can provide incentives similar to subsidies for CCUS such as 45Q, but could be less costly to the government for the same level of emissions reduction. Carbon pricing is not specif ic to CCUS, but instead would incentivize emitters to find the most cost- effective approach to reduce emissions, such as switching to low -carbon technology or improving efficiency. It would incentivize CCUS deployment up to the point when the cost of CCUS emissions reduction for one additional ton of CO 2 equals the value of the carbon price for one additional ton of CO 2. In contrast, 45Q incentivizes CCUS deployment at the tax -payers' expense. 62A border carbon adjustment is an environmental trade policy that consists of charges on imports and so metimes rebates on exports that reflect the regulatory costs borne by domestically produced carbon- intensive products but not by the same foreign -produced products. For example, see B. Flannery et al., \"Framework Proposal for a US Upstream GHG Tax with WTO - Compliant Border Adjustments: 2020 Update,\" Resources for the Future (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 2020). However, carbon pricing would likely have other effects, including increasing the cost of carbon -intensive products such as gasoline or electricity. The increased cost could be passed to consumers or could motivate companies to relocate to countries or regions without a carbon price, a phenomenon known as \"carbon leakage.\" For globally traded energy - intensive commodities, leakage could cause emissions to increase in regions or countries without carbon pricing. To reduce leakages, several studies have proposed border carbon adjustments.62 Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 55 5.4 Policy options Modify incentives. Policymakers could modify existing incentives to facilitate access for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. This policy option could help improve the economic and financial conditions of CCUS projects by addressing factors that affect access to incentives. Potential implementation approaches: Modify 48A tax credits by, for example, adjusting the heat efficiency requirement or extending the credit beyond coal projects. Support changes to or expansion of existing market -based approaches to facilitate access by CCUS projects. Opportunities Considerations Could increase the number or kinds of sectors or facilities that deploy CCUS technologies . Could incentivize new technology development to reduce costs of CO 2 capture . Could be a bridge to future carbon pricing policies . For market -based approaches, could increase demand for CO 2 emissions reduction and volumes of CO 2 traded in the markets. For market -based approaches, could increase the deployment of CCUS if the value of credit is appropriate . Modifying tax credits could reduce government tax revenues. Modifying tax credits could increase use of fossil fuels. Could be subject to political and regulatory uncertainty . For market -based approaches, could be subject to uncertainty in carbon prices.

Although each community is different, they have his torically shared common questions and concerns about CCUS, 64 including: How does it work? Who pays for it? What are the benefits? What are the risks? Will it impact local property values? Who is responsible for underground CO 2? Will it benefit the local economy? 6.1 Key factors influencing community acceptance of CCUS Several factors influence community acceptance of CCUS projects and therefore 63Examples of technologies that have faced public opposition include genetically modified food crops, pesticides, nuclear energy technologies, and renewable energy technologies. 64S. Gre enberg et al., Stakeholder Analysis Report Subtask 3.3 - CarbonSAFE Illinois East Sub -Basin Topical Report 8 , (April 1, 2019). 65S. L. Seigo, S. Dohle, and M. Siegrist, \"Public Perception of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): A Review,\" Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews , vol. 38 (2014): 848- 863; P. will likely be important in determining the course of CCUS development and deployment.65 Knowledge and awareness Generally, knowledge and awareness of CCUS can help communities make informed decisions about projects, but recent studies show that the majority of Americans are unfamiliar with CCUS.66 Successful deployment could require developers, policymakers , or other or ganizations to provide information to communities as projects develop. Policymakers could help communicate the value of CCUS to public audiences by supporting education, public awareness campaigns, and other outreach efforts. However, such efforts can benefit from careful planning and execution. The information provided can be inconsistent or overly technical. This can lead to misconceptions about or opposition to projects. In addition, providing information to communities does not always increase support. Rather, some communities may oppose CCUS more after certain information is provided. Near -term public opinion polling Tcvetkov, A. Cherepovit syn, and S. Fedoseev, \"Public perception of capture and storage: A nscheid, and E. U. Weber, \"Carbon Capture and Storage in the United States: Perceptions, Preferences, and Lessons for Policy,\" Energy Policy , vol. 151 (2021): 112149; L. Whitmarsh, D. Xenias, and C. R. Jones, \"Framing Effects on Public Support for Carbon Capture and Storage,\" Palgrave Communications , vol. 5 (2019). Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 57 in regions of interest for CCUS development could help gauge local priorities and concerns. Perceived risks and benefits Communities are more likely to support CCUS projects when developers provide clear and realistic descriptions of the potential risks and benefits of the projects, according to reports. Individual communities and groups within the community will perceive the potential effects of CCUS differently. Developers and outreach coordinators may be better able to engage with communities if they understand how each communit y view s the potential risks and benefits of CCUS. Social science research studying this topic is ongoing. For example, studies show that people often consider perceived benefits (or perceived lack of benefits) to be more important than perceived risks when forming an opinion of CCUS, according to studies. 67 In particular, communities may perceive local job creation , economic development, regional revitalization, and climate -change mitigation as potential benefits of CCUS (see text box). Perceived risks may include CO 2 leaks, safety risks, and environmental damage. Perceived risks and benefits do not necessarily refl ect the realistic risks and benefits of CCUS projects and may instead reflect unaddressed misconceptions.68 Additional research could help assess broader public attitudes towards CCUS. 67Tcvetk ov et al., \"Public perception of carbon capture and storage \" (2019); W. Leiss and P. Larkin, \"Risk communication and public engagement in CCS projects: the foundations of public acceptability,\" International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management , vol. 22 (2019): 384 -403. Trust Trust in CCUS project developers, regulators, and other stakehold ers is another key variable for acceptance. Prior projects suggest that a community's level of trust that developers and regulators will be honest, fair, and accountable may be more important than understanding technical information about a project. Furthe r, information is more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and objective when it is endorsed by multiple sources. Project developers are perceived as less trustworthy when they are not transparent about decision -making, intentions, and local risks. Trust can be difficult to rebuild after negative experiences between communities and CCUS project stakeholders, or between communities and other related industries . 68We did not assess the environmental or safety risks of CCUS projects because they are generally site and project dependent. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 58 Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and the w orkforce One pot ential benefit of deploying CCUS is the creation of jobs within communities both for construction and operation of CCUS infrastructure. Generally, hundreds to thousands of workers are involved in constructing and retrofitting CCUS facilities. A 2020 analys is indicated that building and operating a 1 million metric ton direct air capture facility could generate roughly 3,500 jobs in fields such as engineering, construction, and materials manufacturing.a Fewer workers are needed to operate CCUS facilities than to build them; however, these jobs are long -lasting and high -paying. CCUS hiring could potentially provide employment to workers from the fossil fuel industry and provide existing industries the opportunity to continue contributing to local economies. Investment in CCUS could generate up to 78,000 jobs related to CCUS facility retrofits by 2050 and an additional 53,000 jobs operating those retrofit facilities. aJ. Larsen, W. Herndon, and G.

Ashworth et al., Communication, Project Planning and Management for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects: An International Comparison (CSIRO: 2010); World Resources Institute, Guidelines for Community Engagement (2010); NPC, Meeting the Dual Challenge (2019). according to stakeholders and reports.69 Community engagement can take many forms. It may be limited to providing answers to questions, or project developers may listen to community concerns and incorporate them directly into alternative project designs. For example, projects seeking funding for front- end engineering design studies through DOE's Carbon Capture Technology Program must consider community engagement and input in identifying alternative transport route designs, when appropriate. According to an expert, recognizing communities as partners in the success of a project could be a strategy for certain CCUS projects. There are many ways that community engagement can fail, including when: There is little to no community engagement at all. Engagement starts too la te in project development. Communication is not open and factual. Communities do not feel their concerns are being addressed. Potential risks and benefits are not clearly communicated. Potential risks and benefits are not evenly distributed. One expert s tated that some communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, may Recent community opposition to pipelines Some local communities oppose carbon dioxide (CO 2) pipeline installation. We reviewed dockets containing public comments related to recent CO 2 pipeline projects. Among the projects we reviewed, the following were common reasons for opposition: Knowledge and awareness Misconceptions about CO 2, such as believing it is explosive. Misconceptions about CO 2 storage processes. Beliefs that the carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) process is unproven and unknown. Perceived risks Perceptions that there are substantial safety risks. Perc eptions of economic losses from damaged land. Perceived lack of benefits Perceptions that CCUS will not benefit local communities. Perceptions that CCUS and CO 2 pipelines offer no climate benefits. Perceptions that CO 2 pipelines only serve the investor's financial interests. Trust Lack of trust in project developers.

There are several examples of projects that have successfully engaged with their local communities; however, there are also multiple examples of unsuccessful community engagement and local opposition contributing to the cancellation, relocation, or delay of capture or storage projects in the U.S. We describe five selected projects below and summarize community engagement practices they did or did not employ in table 12. Jamestown, New York In 2004, developers proposed replacing an existing coal- fired power generation facility with a new one in Jamestown, New York. As a response to community criticism, the project was changed to include a carbon capture and storage demonstration project in 2007. The project was eventually cancelled around 2012 after failing several times to secure DOE funding. Local activists and a coalition of environmental groups undertook years of community organizing in opposition. Many groups that opposed the project said they did not oppose carbon capture and storage technology , but opposed this project because they believed it would increase local electricity costs. 70J.

Shackley, \"Towards a Public Communication Engagement S trategy for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Projects in Scotland,\" (working paper, Scottish Centre for Carbon Capture, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, 2010). Lockwood, Public outreach approaches (2017). Carson, California In 2006, developers proposed a coal -fired power generation facility with carbon capture and storage in Carson, California. This project was cancelled in 2009 due to unsuitable storage site conditions. Prior to cancellation, the project faced opposition from nine local and state environmental organizations and became a ral lying point in a contentious debate over a short -lived state bill to regulate carbon capture and storage. Key community concerns in Carson included a potential increase in air pollution from the new capture facility and environmental justice concerns that this facility might disparately affect disadvantaged communities. Greenville, Ohio In 2007, developers proposed an ethanol carbon capture and storage project in Greenville, Ohio. This project was cancelled in 2009 due to local opposition. The community strongly distrusted the federal government, large corporations, and scientists, accord ing to case studies of the project. 70 Opposition was led by a local grassroots campaign and included a community march and local Jamestown is the largest city in Chautauqua County. It serves as an industrial, commercial, financial, and recreational hub for southwest New York. Carson is an urban, heavily industrialized city in Los Angeles County.

Wallula, Washington In 2007, developers proposed a research project to study carbon capture and storage in basalts on public land, usi ng CO 2 captured from a paper mill in Wallula, Washington. An unassociated but publicly opposed coal -fired power generation facility was proposed at the same site as the research project. Community members voiced opposition at city meetings and submitted mu ltiple local petitions opposing the project, often linking it to the coal-fired power generation facility . The project was moved to private land in 2008, where developers successfully completed it . Decatur, Illinois In 2008, developers proposed an ethanol carbon capture and storage demonstration project in Decatur, Illinois. This project has successfu lly completed CO 2 injections and is in the monitoring phase. Developers carried out a comprehensive community engagement plan. According to an expert familiar with the project, there was no active opposition.

What carbon capture technologies are available and how mature are they? 2. What opportunities exist for using or storing captured carbon dioxide (CO 2), and what is the status of these technologies? 3. What challenges affect the develop ment, demonstration, and deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies? 4. What options could policymakers consider to help address these challenges? To address all research objectives, we assessed available and developing technol ogies and opportunities across the CCUS industry and challenges associated with achieving widespread deployment. We also assessed the maturity, strengths, and limitations of technologies for CO 2 capture and utilization. To do so, we conducted four literature searches; reviewed key reports and peer -reviewed articles; conducted an expert meeting in collaboration with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM); interviewed a variety of stakeholders, including agency officials, academ ic researchers, and representatives of industry organizations, private companies, and nongovernmental organizations; and conducted a site visit to a technology testing facility. Scope We assessed carbon capture technologies that result in a concentrated st ream of CO 2 (i.e., point -source carbon capture and direct air capture), and opportunities for utilization or storage of CO 2. For CO 2 utilization technologies, we focused our assessment on pathways that convert CO 2 into economically valuable products with the greatest potential CO 2 utilization or climate benefits. We did not assess all possible CCUS technologies. For example, we excluded nonconversion CO 2 utilization technologies, such as enhanced oil recovery, CO 2 pipeline technology, and CO 2 injection tech nology as these are all mature and deployed. We selected four examples of CO 2 emitting industrial sectors for vignettes to illustrate variation in sector -specific considerations: power generation, cement manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, and bi oethanol production. The cost and ease of implementing carbon capture into the facilities of these four industrial sectors vary because of differences in the concentration of CO 2 in the gas stream and number of emission sources. Additionally, we selected f our examples of CO 2-based products for vignettes to expand on key metrics for CO 2 conversion technologies: synthetic mineral aggregates, CO 2-cured concrete, commodity chemicals and fuels, and polymers. According to research estimates, these four products h ave the largest CO 2 utilization potentials or are the closest to full market viability. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 66 Literature search For all objectives, we reviewed relevant literature identified by agencies, experts, stakeholders, and our literature search.

The librarian searched a variety of databases, including ProQuest, EBSCO, and Scopus \"pore space ownership,\" and \"acceptance.\" We narrowed our search based on our objectives to articles published since 2015. 72 Results of these searches include d scholarly or peer reviewed material; government reports; trade or industry papers; legislative materials; and association, nonprofit and think tank publications. We selected the articles most relevant to our objectives for further review. Expert meeting We convened a GAO expert meeting with the assistance of NASEM to provide insights to inform our assessment of CCUS technologies.73 The meeting was held over 3 days with 27 experts. (See app. II for a list of experts and their affiliations). We worked with NASEM staff to identify experts in subject matter covering significant areas of our assessment from a range of stakeholder groups, including federal 71The snowball technique involves identifying new articles or reports in those a researcher has already found on the topic. 72Some articles identified using the snowball technique were published before this date. agencies, academia, industry, and nonprofits. We evaluated the experts for potential conflicts of interest, which were considered to be any current financial or other interest that might conflict with the service of an individual because it could (1) impair objectivity or (2) create an unfair competitive advantage for any person or organization. We determined the 27 experts to be free of reported conflicts of interest, except those that were outside the scope of the forum or where the overall design of our meeting and methodology was sufficient to address them, and the group as a whole was determined to not have any inappropriate biases. The comments of these experts generally represented their individual views and not those of the agencies, universities, companies, or nonprofits with which they were affiliated, and are not generalizable to the views of others in the field. We divided the 3 -day meeting into seven moderated discussion sessions: (1) carbon capture technologies, (2) CO 2 utilization technologies, (3) transportation and storage of CO 2, (4) challenges to widespread deployment of CCUS, (5) financial and economic challenges to CCUS and strategies to address them, (6) forward -looking approaches to carbon management, and (7) policy options. The experts were divided into panels for sessions 1 -6 such that each panel included between three and nine experts. 73This meeting of experts was planned and convened with the assistance of NASEM to better ensure that a b readth of expertise was brought to bear in its preparation, however all final decisions regarding meeting substance and expert participation are the responsibility of GAO. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 67 After the panelists responded to all the questions we developed , the floor was opened for discussion among all of the experts for the time remaining in the session. Session 7 was a moderated , open discussion among all of the experts. The meeting was transcr ibed to ensure that we accurately captured the experts' statements. After the meeting, we reviewed the transcripts to characterize their responses and inform our understanding of all four researchable objectives. Consistent with our quality assurance frame work, we provided the experts with a draft of our report and solicited their feedback, which we incorporated as appropriate. Interviews We interviewed key stakeholders with experience and perspectives on the above objectives. Stakeholders included Two rele vant federal agencies: the Department of Energy, including the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and the National Energy Technology Laboratory, and the Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Injection Control Program; Seven academic rese archers; Fourteen industry organizations or private companies; Two non -governmental organizations; 74Policymakers is a broad term including, for example, Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, academic and research institutions, and industry. Two public -private partnership test centers, one of which was conducted during a site visit; and Two federal advisory committees. Because this is a small sam ple of the stakeholders involved in researching and using CCUS, the results of our interviews are illustrative and represent important perspectives, but are not generalizable. Policy options We intend policy options to provide policymakers with a broader base of information for decision-making. 74 The options are neither recommendations to federal agencies nor matters for congressional consideration. They are also not listed in any specific rank or order. We are not suggesting that they be done individually o r combined in any particular fashion. Additionally, we did not conduct work to assess how effective the options may be, and express no view regarding the extent to which legal changes would be needed to implement them. We developed seven policy options to enhance the benefits of or address the challenges to development, demonstration, and deployment of CCUS technologies based on our literature review, expert meeting, and interviews with stakeholders. We then analyzed each policy option by identifying the potential opportunities and considerations of implementing them. The policy options and Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 68 analyses were supported by documentary and testimonial evidence. We conducted our work from May 2021 to September 2022 in accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to technology assessments. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work. We beli eve that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.

Tway Technology and Applications Director for Catalyst Technologies Johnson Matthey Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 71 Appendix III: Technical Descriptions of Carbon Capture Carbon Capture Systems There are different types of carbon capture systems, some for capturing carbon dioxide ( CO 2) from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and others for capturing CO 2 from industrial processes or from ambient air. Different systems can be applied to capture CO 2 depending on circumstances. Pre-combustion capture applies to gasification power generation facilities that first convert fuel to a fuel gas called synthesis gas (syngas). The system captures CO 2 from the syngas before it is combusted. Pre-combustion capture is applied to integrated gasification combined cycle power generation facilities , in which carbon -based fuels react with steam an d oxygen under pressure to form syngas. The syngas then fuels a gas turbine generator to produce electricity. Post -combustion capture refers to the capture of CO 2 from flue gases produced as a result of fuel combustion. As the name implies, CO 2 is separated from the flue gases after complete combustion of fuels. Oxyfuel combustion uses oxygen instead of air for combustion of the primary fuel, resulting in a flue gas that is mainly water vapor and CO 2. Other industrial process capture systems involve processes (e.g., natural gas processing, direct reduction of iron in steel manufacturing, and calcination of limestone in cement manufacturing) that emit gas streams containing CO 2. These systems present opportunities to capture CO 2 in large quantiti es. Direct air capture systems capture CO 2 from ambient air and concentrate it so that it can be transported for use or injection into a storage site. Air is brought into contact with a CO 2-absorbing agent. A regenerator then separates the CO 2 from the ag ent. The CO 2-absorbing agent is then recycled to capture additional CO 2. Gas Separation Technologies In most cases, carbon capture involves separating the CO 2 from a mixture of gases. Different technologies can be used for this separation, depending on the circumstances. Solvent -based gas separation involves chemical or physical absorption of CO 2 from a gas mixture (e.g., flue gas or air) into a liquid carrier (the solvent) that bonds with CO 2. The solvent is regenerated by increasing its temperature or reducing its pressure to break the solvent -CO 2 bond and release the CO 2. High levels of CO 2 capture are possible with commercially available solvent -based systems. Sorbent -based gas separation involves the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2 onto the su rface of a solid sorbent. Like solvents, solid sorbents are usually regenerated by increasing temperature or reducing pressure to release the captured CO 2; however, solid sorbents may require less energy to regenerate compared to solvents due to lower heat capacities. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 72 Membrane -based gas separation uses permeable or semi -permeable materials that act like a filter to separate CO 2 from a gas mixture. Gas separation is achieved by a chemical or physical interaction between the membrane and CO 2. Cryogenic separ ation involves low - temperature distillation. The process depends on the different condensation points of various gases in the mixture. The mixture of gases is cooled to temperatures at which one or more components liquefies or solidifies and separates from the main gas stream. Other hybrid and emerging technologies under investigation include hybrid systems that combine attributes from multiple technologies (e.g., solvents and membranes), novel process conditions (e.g., heat integration), and novel catalyst materials for reaction rate enhancement.

Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 74 Appendix IV: D epartment of Energy Definitions and Descriptions of Technology Readiness Levels Table 1 4: Department of Energy technology readiness levels (TRL) (2011) TRL Definition Description 1 Basic principles observed and reported This is the lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Examples might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties or experimental work that consists mainly of observations of the physical world . Supporting Information includes published research or other references that identify the principles that underlie the technology. 2 Technology concept and/or applications formulated Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be inven ted. Applications are speculative, and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. Examples are still limited to analytic studies. Supporting information includes publications or other references that outline the application bein g considered and that provide analysis to support the concept. The step up from TRL 1 to TRL 2 moves the ideas from pure to applied research. Most of the work is analytical or paper studies with the emphasis on understanding the science better. Experimenta l work is designed to corroborate the basic scientific observations made during TRL 1 work. 3 Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept Active research and development is initiated. This includes analytical studi es and laboratory -scale studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative tested with simulants. Supporting information includes resul ts of laboratory tests performed to measure parameters of interest and comparison to analytical predictions for critical subsystems. At TRL 3 the work has moved beyond the paper phase to experimental work that verifies that the concept works as expected on simulants. Components of the technology are validated, but there is no attempt to integrate the components into a complete system. Modeling and simulation may be used to complement physical experiments. 4 Component and/or system validation in laboratory environment The basic technological components are integrated to establish that the pieces will work together. This is relatively \"low fidelity\" compared with the eventual system. Examples include integration of ad hoc hardware in a laboratory and testing with a range of simulants and small scale tests on actual waste. Supporting information includes the results of the integrated experiments and estimates of how the experimental components and experimental test results differ from the expected system perfor mance goals. TRL 4 -6 represent the bridge from scientific research to engineering. TRL 4 is the first step in determining whether the individual components will work together as a system. The laboratory system will probably be a mix of on hand equipment an d a few special purpose components that may require special handling, calibration, or alignment to get them to function. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 75 5 Laboratory scale, similar system validation in relevant environment The basic technological components are integrated so that the sy stem configuration is similar to (matches) the final application in almost all respects. Examples include testing a high -fidelity, laboratory scale system in a simulated environment with a range of simulants and actual waste. Supporting information include s results from the laboratory scale testing, analysis of the differences between the laboratory and eventual operating system/environment, and analysis of what the experimental results mean for the eventual operating system/environment. The major differenc e between TRL 4 and 5 is the increase in the fidelity of the system and environment to the actual application. The system tested is almost prototypical. 6 Engineering/pilot -scale, similar (prototypical) system validation in relevant environment Engineerin g-scale models or prototypes are tested in a relevant environment. This represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing an engineering scale prototypical system with a range of simulants. Supporting information includes results from the engineering scale testing and analysis of the differences between the engineering scale, prototypical system/environment, and analysis of what the experimental results mean for the eventual operating system/environment. TRL 6 beg ins true engineering development of the technology as an operational system. The major difference between TRL 5 and 6 is the step up from laboratory scale to engineering scale and the determination of scaling factors that will enable design of the operatin g system. The prototype should be capable of performing all the functions that will be required of the operational system. The operating environment for the testing should closely represent the actual operating environment. 7 Full-scale, similar (prototyp ical) system demonstrated in relevant environment This represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in a relevant environment. Examples include testing full -scale prototype in the field with a range of simulants in cold commissioning. Supporting information includes results from the full -scale testing and analysis of the differences between the test environment, and analysis of what the experimental results mean for the eventual operating system/environment. Final design is virtually complete. 8 Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration The technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true syst em development. Examples include developmental testing and evaluation of the system with actual waste in hot commissioning. Supporting information includes operational procedures that are virtually complete. An Operational Readiness Review (ORR) has been s uccessfully completed prior to the start of hot testing. 9 Actual system operated over the full range of expected mission conditions The technology is in its final form and operated under the full range of operating mission conditions. Examples include us ing the actual system with the full range of wastes in hot operations.

This reaction occurs in nature as well. For example, calcium -rich rocks react with atmos pheric CO 2 over geologic timescales to form limestone (CaCO 3) deposits. Mineral carbonation reactions are slow, with the rate of the reaction depending on the concentration of CO 2 and the mineral undergoing carbonation. For example, portlandite undergoes c arbonation more rapidly than Ordinary Portland Cement. 75 Elevated pH levels facilitate the formation of carbonates; however, dissolving CO 2 in water to induce the carbonation reaction lowers the pH.76 Optimal pH levels for mineral carbonation can be maintained through the use of a high pH buffer system.77 The reaction can also be water sensitive. While water accelerates the carbonation reaction on mineral surfaces and is a co -product of the reaction, it can keep CO 2 from reaching the interior 75Portlandite is hydrated limestone, Ca(OH) 2, and is sometimes also called slaked lime . Ordinary Portland Cement \u2014the most commonly used binder in concrete \u2014is a low- rank silicate, containing primarily two or mor e parts lime (CaO) to every one part silicate (SiO 2). 76The pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is. A pH below 7 is acidic and a pH above 7 is alkaline. 77Buffer systems prevent acidic or basic reactants from causing large changes in pH over a specific range. surfaces of a por ous mineral for continued reaction. Chemical conversion Hydrogenation refers to any reaction between molecular hydrogen (H 2) and another chemical. There are two types of hydrogenation reactions with CO 2, direct and indirect . Direct hydrogenation uses heat and a metal catalyst to facilitate a reaction between CO 2 and H 2.78 Indirect hydrogenation is a multistep process for converting CO 2 to products. First, CO 2 is converted to carbon monoxide (CO) which can be done through either the reverse water -gas shift reaction or through electrochemistry.79 CO can then be mixed with H 2 to create a gas mixture known as syngas. CO is more reactive than CO 2 and can be an end product or a feedstock for a wide range of chemicals. Syngas conversion to other valuable products can occur through hydrogenation or through the Fischer -Tropsch process to make liquid fuels such as aviation fuel and gasoline. 80 Electrochemistry is a process to convert CO 2 to products using electricity instead of heat. Direct electrochemical reduction of CO 2 produces CO and molecular oxygen (O 2). 78A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed by the reaction. 79The revers e water -gas shift reaction is a reaction between CO 2 and H 2 to produce CO and water (H 2O). 80The Fischer -Tropsch process is a widely commercial ized chemical reaction that converts CO and H 2 into water and a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that can be used as fuels. Decarbonization GAO -22-105274 77 Other electrochemical processes can reduce CO 2 to formic acid or to methanol. Co-polymerizatio n is the process of making polymers using two or more different starting molecules \u2014called monomers. Certai n polymers can have a percentage of the fossil fuel -based monomers, such as ethylene and propylene oxides, replaced with CO 2. Polymers do not require as much energy input for conversion compared to other commodity chemicals because reaction energy is provided by the fossil fuel feedstock that is not replaced by CO 2. Microbial conversion Algae, a type of photosynthetic microbe, converts sunlight and CO 2 into energy for growth, and its biomass can be used to produce usable products. Algae cultivation can be l and and water intensive and cultivation optimization is an ongoing area of research. Some ways to minimize land and water intensity include algae cultivation on non -farmable land or the use of wastewater, brackish, or seawater instead of freshwater. There are generally two cultivation methods for algae: open raceway ponds and closed photobioreactors. Open raceway ponds are of interest for biofuels to minimize production costs. Closed photobioreactors have higher capital and operating expenses , but can have tighter control over cultivation conditions and enhanced product purity compared to open raceway ponds. Thus, closed photobioreactors are preferred for the production of high value materials such as nutraceuticals and animal feed. Nonphotosynthetic microb es, such as acetogens or methanogens, convert CO 2 or CO to usable products without the need for sunlight in a process known as gas fermentation. Acetogens can convert CO and water to ethanol via gas fermentation, but the carbon efficiency is only 33.3 percent.81 Using H 2 instead of water increases the car bon efficiency up to 100 percent. Acetogens can also convert CO 2 to ethanol via gas fermentation, but, in contrast to using CO as a feedstock, the process does require H 2 to be an energy source to activate the reaction as well as provide the hydrogen atoms necessary for ethanol formation.82 81Carbon efficiency is defined as the percent of carbon atoms going into the reacti on to produce the desired product. 82CO can serve as both a carbon and energy sourc e in the gas fermentation process.
