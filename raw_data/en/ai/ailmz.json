The guide introduces key principles and action steps that can be applied when considering, implementing and/or evaluating s ocial marketing approaches as a part of communicable disease prevention activities or other public health programmes. S ocial m arketing is defined as an approach that seeks to integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to influence behaviours that benefit individuals and communities for social good. This approach draws on data about beliefs, attitudes and behaviours, behavioural theory, and experiential evidence, about what works and doesn't work in changing behaviours, to develop publi c health interventions. Social m arketing also incorporates input from end -users, stakeholders, partners and an analysis of external competitive forces that either encourage or restrict desired behaviours. The guide has three parts. Part 1 introduces the basic social marketing principles and concepts. Part 2 focuses on presenting a logical framework for applying social marketing in the development and im plementation of communicable disease and other public health interventions. Part 3 provides a compendium of workflow sheets, checklists and memory aides to support public health programme managers and practitioners in undertaking these activities. Introdu ction The aim with this guide is to provide public health programme managers and practitioners with an accessible summary of what social marketing is and how to use its core concepts and approaches in planning, implementing and evaluating communicable disease prevention activities or programmes. Recent studies have shown that social marketing, as part of a comprehensive public health strategy, can be an effecti ve approach to better understand and positively influence people's behaviours related to the prevention and control of communicable diseases [1, 2]. Throughout the document, examples drawn from practice are presented to illustrate various theories, concept s and approaches. Most of these ex amples relate to ECDC and other activities in contributing to prevention and control of measles (especially) and rubella within the context of World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe priority of eliminating measles and rubella by 2015. This guide is divided into three parts. Part 1 focuses on w hy public health programmes can benefit from the application of social marketing principles, concepts and approaches. This part serves as an introductory planning guide to s ocial marketing for those public health staff responsible for developing, commissionin g and overseeing the delivery of programmes. Its aim is to help public health programme managers and practitioners understand the logic and potential added value of applying social marketing approaches. To this end it introduces a set of concepts and princ iples that can be used when considering, applying and/or evaluating s ocial marketing approaches. It also reflects on ethical and economic implications of s ocial marketing. Case studies in the communicable disease area are used to illustrate points througho ut. Part 2 focuses on h ow to apply social m arketing concepts and principles. It identifies a set of four core action planning stages and associated tasks that can enable practitioners to de velop and deliver an effective social marketing strategy. Case stu dies and examples from communicable diseases are used to illustrate the action steps described. Part 3 provides a compendium of workflow sheets, checklists and memory aides to support public health programme managers and practitioners in undertaking activi ties related to the stages and tasks described in Part 2. An annex provides more detailed information on the c haracteristics of successful behavioural intervention planning. Example - UNICEF and the 2005/06 avian influenza outbreak in Turkey During the 2005/06 avian influenza outbreak in Turkey, UNICEF coordinated a multisectoral multiagency task force that utilised s ocial marketing techniques to deliver target -specific communications to ' hard-to- reach ' high- risk populations. Focus groups and interviews were conducted wi th mothers living in the rural eastern part of Turkey to better understand their perceptions and risk behaviours (e.g. bringing ch ickens into the house to keep them warm), to identify messages and incentives that could reduce risk , and media/community channels (e.g. language specific radio and television broadcasts) that could deliver reliable understandable information appropriate t o the language skills and literacy of the population. Intelligence gathered also informed advocacy strategies for poultry compensation policies. [3] Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 2 This social m arketing guide was developed through a collaborative (co -creation 1) process that gathered input from frontline public health professionals who use s ocial marketing in their daily work. The logic, content and organisation of the guide reflect their suggestions and recommendations. We see this guide as an evolving guide and would like to hear your feedback on ways it has been used and how it could be improved. Using this guide Context matters Each public health service faces its own contextual challenges and different countries and settings have their own unique communication and marketing capacities and capabilities related to public health. We have therefore provided a set of concepts and too ls that can be used in different contexts to strengthen existing approaches or act as a basic resource where these approaches are less developed. Not a stand -alone approach Social marketing is a systematic approach to public health interventions focused o n influencing behaviour [4] but it should not be viewed as a stand- alone activity. Rather, it should be seen as complementary to health education, health promotion, risk communication and other community engagement strategies that are also focused on increasing understanding of people's perceptions, attitudes, knowledge and behaviours and strengthening public engagement and empowerment [5, 6]. Social marketing can also strengthen the health service, health system design and health policy interventions aimed at improving access and reducing barriers to public health action, including addressing issues related to health inequalities [7]. Real world planning Most professionals tend in reality not to follow a set structured approach to developing, delivering an d evaluating interventions intended to influence public behaviour related to infectious disease. This set of guides to s ocial marketing accepts this reality and rather than setting out a fixed set of planning steps, sets out a set of concepts, a basic plan ning framework and then supplements this with a compendium of tools that professionals can use in a flexible way that best suits the particular challenges they face. A case is worth a thousand words An assortment of communicable disease related examples a re used in these guides to social marketing to illustrate key social marketing concepts. For example, a sequence of case studies on how different social marketing concepts and principles can be applied to help public health programme managers and practitioners better understand and address measles vaccination uptake challenges are presented. Learning from commercial approaches Whilst much can be learned from commercial approaches, what works in the commercial sector is not necessarily valid for the health sector. A person, for example, does not think about getting a new disease in the same way that one thinks about getting a new car. Social m arketing appro aches that aim at social good, will need to adapt commercial approaches - that tend to focus on profits and individuals - and apply them in ways that reflect ethical standards and an understanding of the influence of environmental and social determinants of health 1 Co-creation is a business strategy focusing on customer experience and interactive relationships . Co-creation allows and encourages a more active involvement from the customer to create a value rich exper ience.

This has left large pockets of susceptible populations in many EU countries, and once well -controlled diseases are now reappearing. In 2011, for example, more than 30 000 cases of measles were reported in the EU and European F ree Trade Area (EFTA) countries. Cases were reported in all countries, except the island nations of Iceland and Cyprus. The outbreak of measles in the western part of Europe was amongst the largest in the world in 2011, with the highest number of cases in Germany, France, Belgium, Austria and Denmark. This is a public health failure. Measles is completely preventable and Europe has committed to eliminate its transmission by 2015. Measles is not a harmless disease. One fifth of cases in the UK needed hospit alisation and eight people died from the disease in the EU in 2011. While the numbers of outbreaks and reported cases in Member States in 2012 (and 2013) were significantly lower than during 2011, the number of cases reported is still above the levels need ed to achieve elimination by 2015. The key factor contributing to the European measles epidemic is sub- optimal vaccination uptake and reach that has left large population groups either unprotected or under -protected. The majority of European cases (90%) were amongst adolescents and adults who had not been vaccinated or for whom vaccination history was not reported [8]. In many places, current approaches are not working well enough. ECDC, WHO and other organisations have been looking at ways that s ocial marketing concepts and approaches can be applied to increase measles uptake amongst currently un - and under -vaccinated populations. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 4 1. What is s ocial m arketing? Social marketing is a set of evidence and experience- based concepts and principles drawn from the field of marketing that provide a systematic approach to influence behaviours that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good (see Figure 1). Like commercial marketing it is a fusion of science, practical 'know how' and reflective practice focused on continuously improving the effectiveness and efficienc y of programmes [9]. 'Social Marketing seeks to develop and integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to influence behaviours that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good' [10]. Figure 1 . Stages in adopting a new behaviour Makin g the case for s ocial marketing Numerous studies have shown that social marketing can be an effective approach to influencing behaviour in the field of public health. Social m arketing approaches ha ve been used for many years in designing, implementing and evaluating public health initiatives in the fight against HIV AIDS, malaria, influenza, diarrheal diseases and many other forms of communicable disease [11, 12, 13]. Social marketing has also been effectively used to tackle non - communicable disease challenges such as smoking and other social challenges such as environmental issues, safety and crime. Social marketing approaches add value to public health programmes by providin g systematic ways of actively engaging with end -users and a focus on behaviour change, relationship building, measureable objectives and integration of many intervention methods. End-user driven Many programmes are constructed by experts and policy plann ers who attempt to drive the behaviour changes they desire down through populations. This approach is influenced by political as well as by professional assessments of risk and solutions, but does not always include citizen/patient/consumer insight researc h. As a consequence the targeted people may misunderstand these interventions or view them as irrelevant and end up rejecting the proposed solutions. Social marketing approaches can be used to help engage end- users in the development, implementation and ev aluation of policies and programmes. This is done by integrating insights from individuals, those that influence them (influencers) and other concerned people (stakeholders) into planning and implementation processes. This is further informed by social marketing research, evidence- based practice and the use of social -behavioural theories. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 5 A focus on longer term behaviour change and relationship building Many pub lic health programmes are short term and focus their evaluat ion on process or outputs (e.g. number of vaccine information leaflets distributed) rather than changes in population behaviour (e.g. vaccination uptake). Applying social marketing approaches can help programmes enhance their focus on behavioural change outcomes. Social marketing is built o n the understanding that behaviour change is a process not just an event and often requires sustained interventions over time. Social marketing also acknowledges that significant benefits can be gained in building long- term relationships, particularly when addressing issues like vaccination where trust has been shown to be a key element of compliance. Social marketing recognises that what people know, and even people's attitudes, do not always impact on their actual behaviour. It seeks to understand people' s motivations and needs as well as gain a better understanding of how the environments in which their actions take place influence behaviours. Social marketing, for example, looks at the behavioural impacts of various external influencers; such as, time co nstraints, convenience factors, social consequences, and competing behaviours (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Factors influencing behaviours [14] Transparent and measureable objectives Many public programmes set either unrealistically ambitious goals that are not achievable in the short term or unclear measurable objectives. Social marketing identifies ways to develop transparent and measurable objectives that can aid evaluation and learning about what works and what does not. S ocial marketing is also concerned with the efficiency of behavioural change programmes as well as their efficacy. Intelligence gathered through the use of social marketing approaches can help inform managers and practitioners on the best way to spend budgets to realise the most impact for the smallest investment, what programmes to continue and expand and what programs to reduce or cut. A full intervention mix There are a limited number of programmes that utilise and coordinate a full intervention mix of education, support services, (re)design (i.e. changing system and environmental factors which promote or inhibit uptake of vaccination) , regulation and control mea sures. Social marketing can help programmes identify and encompass a broader range of evidence- based and insight -driven interventions that have been shown to influence behaviour change among: individuals, organisations, social networks and social norms, co mmunities, businesses, markets, and public policy. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 6 What s ocial marketing is not Social marketing is often confused with s ocial advertising, s ocial media marketing and social network marketing. These types of interventions have value as intervention tactics but are not what social marketing is about. Social marketing seeks to move beyond just informing, increasing knowledge and understanding or seeking to influence people's attitudes or beliefs. All of these goals are important but s ocial marketing interventions are designed to influence behaviour of individua ls and communities for a greater social good. Behaviour cha nge intervention insights from social m arketing research - selected examples [6]. Education Beliefs and values influence how people behave. Programmes should start by understanding people's beliefs and attitudes and use these to inform the development of behaviour change services and products. People often use mental short cuts and trial -and-error approaches to make decisions rather than 'rational' decision -making. Understanding these short cuts or heuristics (the process that enables a person to discover or learn something for themselves) should be used to develop interventions and new 'scripts' associated with the behaviour. People can be 'locked into' patterns of behaviour and need practi cal help to break them or unfreeze current behaviour. Programmes that provide practical support to change, are easy to access and require small steps tend to be more effective. Support Change in behaviour is usually a process not an event, and often requires several attempts before success. When delivering intervention programmes there is a need to be persistent, sustain interventions over time and offer multiple paths to success. Interventions should also seek to support positive behaviour by maintaining a relationship with people that affirms their new behaviour and encourages them to build on it. Social relationships and social support have a strong and persistent influence on behavio ur. Working with and through key influencers improves the impact of behaviour change programmes. Use the power of group norms and behaviour to inform and engage people in change, let them know that others are changing. Design People influence and are influenced by their physical, social and economic environments. There is a limit to a person's capacity to change if the environment works against the desired change. Deliver programmes that tackle the underlying environmental, social and economic barriers to c hange as well as personal knowledge, attitude, motivational and emotional factors. Regulations - rewards and punishments The more beneficial or rewarding an experience, the more likely it is to be repeated. Maintaining positive behaviour can be assisted by reinforcement. Behavioural interventions should seek to reward desired behaviours and when appropriate penalise inappropriate behaviour. People are often motivated to do the 'right thing' for the community as well as for themselves and their families. Ge tting people to accept that a desired behaviour is a norm in the community and one that is valued by others has been shown to be an effective change strategy. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 7 What are the key social marketing concepts and principles? The social marketing ' customer/citizen triangle' [15] is a visual way to highlight the key features of social marketing. Six key concepts are emphasised: Insight, Exchange, Competition, Audience Segmentation, Behaviour and Method Mix. The citizen/customer/patient is in the centre of the process and approach. These s ocial marketing concepts are the necessary ingredients for successful social programmes that seek to influence behaviour and gain popular public support Figure 3. The s ocial marketi ng 'customer/citizen triangle' [14] These social marketing concepts are derived from an evidence and experiential base about what works in the commercial sector and in the development and delivery of public sector programmes designed to influence behaviour for social good. Key concep t 1: Insight Insight s are 'deep truths' and understanding about why people act as they do. Insights are developed from formative research2, observational data, demographic data, service use data, problem or issue tracking data, and in the case of communicable disease programm es, epidemiological data. Social marketing is based on the development of deep insights into people's lives, with a focus on what will or will not motivate or enable people to change behaviour, develop a new one, modify and/or sustain it in any given situa tion. Social marketing is focused on identifying and developing actionable insights that can be used to select and develop interventions that will influence behaviour. These insight -informed interventions are subsequently tested through pilots and refined or rejected according to their utility. Social marketing also undertakes situational analysis research that identifies external influences on behaviour such as environmental, economic, social and cultural factors. As indicated in Figure 4 , social marketi ng analyses both problematic behaviour that needs to be changed and positive behaviours that need to be encouraged and supported. Both the enabling factors that exist and the environmental barriers people face in adopting the targeted behaviours are assess ed. Social marketing works to develop interventions that remove or reduce barriers to positive health behaviours for example by reducing or removing costs associated with vaccine uptake. Social marketing also seeks to enhance enabling factors for example b y promoting vaccine uptake as a desired social norm. 2 Formative research gathers insights from end- users through dialogue and conversation and can include a combination of techniques such as focus groups, literature reviews, surveys, stakeholder discussions, partnership panels, media audits, in-depth and/or 'intercept' interviews (such as catching people in the hallway). Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 8 Figure 4. Incentives and barriers to behaviour change [14] Key conc ept 2: Exchange The concept of exchange as well as that of value creation is a central concept in social marketing. Exchange is based on observations that we tend to change our behaviour when we perceive that it is in our interest to do so, either through rational choice or through a more subconscious process. Things and actions that make us feel better, safer, or more respected tend to be valued and have an impact on our behaviour. If we want to influence behaviour we need to understand what people value. We can then use this information to develop interventions, systems, products or services that people will want to engage with or use. A key task in social marketing is to develop an 'exchange proposition' that sets out what people have to do and/or the cost of this actio n3 in order to get the value that they want. 3 Costs may be economic, social, physical or psychological Measles vaccination case (b) - Gaining insights into Roma attitudes towards vaccinatio n uptake [16] In 2012, ECDC supported a project aimed at gaining insights from Roma parents and grandparents about their children's low measles vaccination uptake levels and their attitudes towards healthcare providers (HCPs). A literature review, interviews and focus groups were utili sed as data gather ing techniques. The result, 'Insights,' about why people believed what they did and acted in the way that they did contributed to the development of a promotional strategy and a set of messages and recommendations to healthcare provider s from so -called 'hard-to-reach ' populations which were included in the EC DC Let's Talk about Protection [16] vaccination guide for HCPs. Messages included: know more about us. reframe 'hard -to-reach' as 'poorly -reached' health system failures. view immunisation as one part of larger health challenges. integrate us into mainstream programmes. involve us in all stages of programmes aimed at enhancing our inclusion and health. adapt governance and health systems to be more inclusive. support Health Mediators and other community health workers as they are critically important resources. be accessible and respectful. beware of incentives that could be viewed as bribes for compliance. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 9 Sometimes these propositions do not appeal to people's rationality; often they aim to influence people's emotional subconscious. Exchanges may not always be positive. In some cases we may need to use negative exchanges. Often it is also necessary to focus on the short -term benefits of recommended behaviours rather than focus on long-term benefits as people place more value on immediate gains rather than gains that they may get in the distant future. Figure 5. Identifying short -term benefits [ 14] Four 'forms' of exchange Social marketing programmes aimed at influencing behaviour can select one of the four primary 'f orms' of exchange. These forms of intervention are defined by two main factors. First, whether the intervention uses rewards or some form of punishment to encourage a particular behaviour. Second, whether the approach seeks to influence cognitive decision -making or unconscious decision- making. The combination of these two factors creates four different possibilities: 'Hug' and 'Nudge' (relat ed to providing rewards and in centives to target groups; e.g. parents, providers, etc. for desired behaviours) and 'Shove', and 'Smack' (related to providing punishments and disincentives to target gro ups for undesired behaviours) (see Figure 6) . 'Hugs' fo cus on: High cognitive engagement and positive rewards for compliance; e.g. offering rewards or incentives for being vaccinated; such as, money [18] , services, sweets. Example: In some EU countries, unvaccinated children are denied access to school. This tactic is used to penalise parents who do not get their children vaccinated and encourage people to take up vaccination. Ethical concerns have been raised about denying children education when the ir parents refuse vaccination. [17]. Example : It may be more effective to put emphasis on the immediate benefits of being vaccinated, such as feeling safer and being a good parent rather than on the possible long -term benefit of not contracting a disease. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 10 'Nudges' focus on: Low cognitive engagement and positive rewards for compliance; e.g. setting up a default scheme where vaccination is given to children in schools unless a parent takes the time to opt out. The 'nudge' here comes from requiring parents to take an active step not to get vaccination. 'Shoves' focus on : Low cognitive engagement and punishment for non- compliance; e.g. children must have been vaccinated before they are allowed to attend school. Parents need to make sure they have been vaccinated and that they have an official record of it to show the school. 'Smacks' focus on : High cognitive engagement and punishment for non -compliance; e.g. parents are fined or banned from taking their child to school if they are not vaccinated. All these forms of intervention are legitimate public health strategies (see Figure 6). Often a combination of such approaches is needed to encourage compliance with public health guidance. The selection of which combination of interventions will depend on what actions literature and target audience research show are effective, acceptable, practical and financially feasible and sustainable. Figure 6. Hugs, nudges, shoves and smacks [19] Key concept 3: Competition Competitive factors are those that get in the way of positive behaviours; e.g. like not using condoms for HIV prevention because they are perceived as 'unmanly', thought to reduce pleasure and/or not affordable or easily available. Competition analysis examines both internal and external competitive factors as well as barriers and enablers that impact on behaviour. Internal competition includes psychological factors, pleasure, desire, and risk - taking whereas external competition includes wider influences an d influencers on behaviour, promoting and reinforcing alternative or negative behaviours. Social marketing seeks to remove or reduce competitive barriers; e.g. by providing vaccination services in evening hours or at day care facilities within work places which can reduce the need for parents to take time off work to get their children immunised. Competition can come from external sources such as cultural norms or economic factors but also from internal competition associated with people's preferred or lear ned behavioural responses such as many people's preferences for inaction or the avoidance of loss (see Table 1 ). TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 11 Table 1. External and internal c ompetition factors External competition Internal competition Social influences Over-confidence Cultural influences Temporal discounting (value the immediate over the long -term) Media influence Loss aversion Physical environment influence Pleasure and temptation Economic influence Lack of effort Close family and friends influence Habit Availability of services or products Addiction Systems barriers Biological drives Social marketing also works to counter forces that actively seek to promote resistance to recommended behaviours. To this end, it develops an analysis of these forces and actors , and ident ifies strategies to reduce their influence. Key concept 4: Behaviour - behaviour theory and behavioural goals Behaviour theory is used to inform and guide all social marketing interventions. Through a broad behavioural analysis we get a fuller picture of the current behavioural patterns and trends to make sure that the incentives and barriers associated with both the 'problematic behaviour' and the 'desired behaviour' a re fully understood. Example: An analysis of obstacles to MMR vaccination uptake amongst Roma populations in Bulgaria [21] revealed: Challenges associated with the target group\u00b4s knowledge, attitudes and behaviours Poor awareness and knowledge of antige ns and diseases they protect from (including measles). Repeated visits are required to meet requirements of the national vaccination schedule. Competing priorities lead to missed vaccinations. Worries and misconceptions about side -effects and safety of certain antigens. Challenges related to being able to communicate effectively Low literacy and numeracy, language ability and health culture among vulnerable populations (e.g. Roma). Low self -efficacy of Roma vis -a-vis medical practitioners and institu tions. Challenges related to creating circumstances that make it easier for the target group to take desired action Lack of trust betwe en caregiver and primary health care physicians. Poor ability of primary health care physicians to communicate effectively with Roma. High opportunity costs associated with repeated visits to general practitioners (GPs). Once you have clearly understood the current behaviour, you can start developing and testing all possible interv entions designed to encourage and maintain desired behaviour , and interventions designed to influence problematic behaviours. The specific behavioural objectives are set out in SMART format: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Reliable and Time bound. Example: In some instances, public health authorities inform their clients about ways to read scientific reports and actively identify inaccurate web -based vaccination safety informati on and counter misinformation. [20] SMART approach Specific: Precise - not op en to different interpretations; Measurable: Can observe and collect objective measures; Achievable: With the resources available; Reliable: Consistent, relevant, can be gathered; Time bound: Measured within the time frame of the intervention. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 12 Key concept 5: Audience segmentation Segmentation is the division of an audience we intend to address into groups who share similar beliefs, attitudes and behavioural patterns. This approach goes beyon d the demographic, epidemiological and service uptake data - based collection and aim s to include data about people's beliefs, attitudes, understanding and observed behaviours. Target audiences are segmented using these data sets. Interventions are directly tailored to a specific audience segment rather than being addressed to a broader general audience with the hope that those that need the intervention will be reached (the so -called 'spray and pray approaches'). In this way we can develop interventions aime d at specific sub- groups and specific behaviours. Audience segmentation also strengthens traditional public health targeting with other data focusing on 'why people act as they do' and observing their actual behaviour. Measles vaccination case (c) - measles vaccination uptake - segmentation of under -vaccinated populations Studies [22, 23] have identified a range of characteristics of unprotected and under -protected populations (unimmunised and under -immunised populations). In broad terms four key population groups have been identified: 'The hesitant' Those who have concerns about perceived safety issues and/or are unsure about needs, procedures and timings for immunising. 'The unconcerned' Those who consider immunisation a low priority and have no real perceived risk of vaccine- preventable diseases. 'The poorly reached' Those who have limited or difficult access to services, related to social exclusion, poverty and, in the case of more integrated and affluent populations, factors related to convenience. 'The active resisters' Those with personal, cultural or religious beliefs which discourage or exclude vaccination. Needs of various key populations Gathering insights, within representatives of these different groups, raised a variety of concerns related to healthcare providers' behaviour and communication as well as issues related to messages and system design. 'Hesitant ' parents noted that healthca re providers' communication, often due to time constraints, was generally a one- way communication (no patient/doctor dialogue) and the messages were well -intentioned but uniform for all people. Healthcare providers were advised to place more emphasis on di alogues - which first elicit information about parents' specific concerns and anxieties and then adapt and customise messages to the identified needs of individuals and groups. 'Unconcerned' parents asked for healthcare provider s to keep the focus of vacci nation discussions on the benefits of protection. They indicated their need to be made more aware that when they get their children vaccinated they are protecting them, and the communities in which they live, from serious and potentially deadly diseases. The 'poorly reached' reported a need for improving how services and delivery systems are designed and provided. They asked for more attention to be paid to costs, location, staffing, transport, scheduling and timing as key determinants of vaccination progra mme uptake and success. They recommended that 'vaccination journeys ' need to be made easier. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 13 Key concept 6: Method mix A social marketing programme will normally consist of a mix of interventions, some appealing to logic and others focused on emotions and mindless choosing. To select the optimal mix of interventions it is important to rely on research evidence and data collection, e.g. end- user insights. The selection of the types of intervention and the weight given to them is driven by judgments based on data, evidence, acceptability and ability to implement and sustain these interventions. Five types of interventions have been identified. Figure 7 identifies a variety of actions that could be associated with each type of intervention. Figure 7 . Inter vention types with associated actions [15] Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 14 The 4 Ps Another interventional framework used in commercial marketing focuses on the 4 Ps4 of product, price, place and promotion. In social marketing , products may be tangible (vaccinations, condoms, fruit, nicotine patches) or intangible (ideas, values, services). Price represents the cost of adopting that behaviour/change. These may be monetary, (the cost of buying a vaccine), or psychological and emotional (a nxiety related to vaccine safety concerns), social (the cost of looking different in one's peer group), practical (getting to the GP's office), temporal (the need to take time off work), physical (pain of injection), and so on. Place refers to the channels used to promote and support that behaviour/change. It might include distribution channels (sending reminders with SMS messages) and settings (bringing interventions to the consumer, into workplaces, schools, day care centres rather than expecting parents to bring their children to GP surgeries). Promotion refers to the means, tools and channels used to communicate the benefits of the change, e.g. advertising, PR, media advocacy, information materials, word of mouth, direct mail etc. Advocates of this model stress that looking at the 4Ps ensures that public health programme managers go beyond just thinking about promotions.5 They also consider what the benefit of the health behaviour is ( core product) as well as the benefit of any tangible product, for exam ple, a malarial net. The 4Ps model also encourages a better understanding of the costs of adopting behaviours ( price) and the channels of persuasion that could be used (place). 4 Many leading social marketers believe it is time that the 4Ps were consigned to the history of social marketing . One of the big weaknesses these authors point out is that the 4Ps approach starts from the perspective of the social marketing planner and not the client. When using the 4Ps approach it is also possible to omit a consideration of wider influences on behaviour such as environmental and economic factors. However, the 4Ps are still a helpful conceptual model that can help in the development of social marketing plans alongside other conceptual models and tools. 5 If only the promotional P is used, it is more appropriate to de scribe the intervention as communication or advertising. Health campaigns which use only promotion are often described as Social Marketing when in reality they are simply social advertising. Measles Vaccination Case (d) - Method mix - top i nterventions to enhance measles uptake among vulnerable groups * Control Motivate local authorities and non -governmental organisations to cooperate on community -based interventions, particularly targeted to underserved groups. Monitor the web to understand concerns on vaccination and provide answe rs based on trusted web sources. Inform Use mass media, e.g. insert measles -related messages in television so ap operas, encourage wider collaboration between public heal th and the film and TV industry. Design Make remembering easier, e.g. by strengthening efficient alert and reminder systems to remind people about vaccination. Make vaccination more accessible, e.g. offer immunisation days/campaigns in different locati ons, where people work and live. Educate Invest in education for physicians and nurses to communicate more efficiently a nd forcefully to their patients. Conduct thorough epidemiological and behaviour al analyses of the groups at ri sk for lower vaccination uptake. Support Include measles under broader concerns about children's health and support the mothers'/grandmothers' role as key opinion leaders on health issues in their famil ies. Develop programmes to specifically address stigma and discrimination . Enhance links, planning, implementation and evaluation process engagement with field workers. *Adapted from recommendations of participants of the ECDC 'INFORM, PROTECT, IMMUNISE: engaging under -served populations' meeting in Dublin 2012. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 15 The 4 Ps are often (though not always) used in conjunction with each other. Soc ial marketing seeks the best combination of them to satisfy as much as possible the often changing needs of the population. For example, consumer research may show that a particular population is unaware of the benefits of vaccination, and so the promotion al element of the method mix may be given greatest emphasis. However, as the campaign proceeds, awareness may become widespread and new problems may emerge as central concerns like having access to vaccine or its availability. Table 2 . Summary chart of k ey social m arketing c oncepts Concept 1: Insight Social marketing is based on developing insight into people's lives and on what motivates, enables or prevents them from behaving in health enhancing ways. By developing a deep understanding about why people think and act as they do it is possible to develop 'actionable insights' that inform the development of intervention programmes and tacti cs that people will respond to. Concept 2: Exchange Exchange is based on observing that we tend to change our behaviou r when we perceive that it is in our interests to do so. We are also normally seeking value in experiences or things that make us feel better, safer or more respected. Forms of intervention include: Hug: h igh cognitive engagement with a positive reward Nudge: l ow cognitive engagement with a positive reward Shove: low cognitive engagement with a penalty Smack: h igh cogn itive engagement with a penalty Concept 3: Competition Competition analysis examines both internal and external competition as well as barriers and enabling factors that impact on behaviour. Internal competition includes psychological factors, pleasure, desire, and risk - taking whereas external competition includes wider influences and influencers on behaviour, promoting and reinforcing al ternative or negative behaviours. Concept 4: Behaviour Social marketing is focused on influencing people's behaviour, based on SMART objectives. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Reliable and Time bound. Interventions are then developed t o focus on specific behaviours. There is a focus on what triggers and establishes behaviours and what influences the maintenance, compliance and reinforcement of behaviour. Concept 5: Audience segmentation Target audiences are segmented using insight and behavioural data into sub-groups that share common beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Interventions are directly tailored to specific audience segments rather than relying on a broad approach which covers a large general audience. Segmentation strengthens traditional public health targeting with additional data focusing on 'why people act as they do' what they think and believe about health issues and data collected form observing their actual behavi our. Concept 6:Method Mix Social marketing applies an appropriate mix of methods to achieve the goals of the programme. A range of different approaches are examined and used to establish the most effective, efficient and cost effective mix of methods. Types of intervention include: Control - to require, regulate, and enforce Inform - to communicate facts and attitudes Design - to alter social, physical or service environment Educate - to enable and empower Support - to serve and practically assist Social marketing also considers the devel opment and promotion of social products and services Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 16 When should social m arketing be used? Ethical guidelines Social marketing, like other forms of public health interventions, is also guided by ethical considerations. Whenever a decision is made that will directly influence the behaviour of people, even if adopting that behaviour is likely to protect them from a communicable disease, it is important that the ethical implications of all actions are considered. Public health programme managers/practitio ners and policy makers need to explicitly agree on the appropriateness of public health programmes that aim to influence behaviours and they also need to communicate these decisions and the rationale that lies behind them with the beneficiary groups. The following ethical code [26] can help when making decisions about when to use social marketing: evaluate the ethicality of a policy before agreeing to develop a strategy work to ensure that any intervention will do more good than harm and that all potential harms are minimis ed and transparently explained select tactics that are sensitive, effective and efficient and produce the greatest return on social investment determine that the intervention gives assistance when and where it is needed evaluate and publi sh a report on outcomes of all interventions ensure that the autonomy of target audiences is recognised and respected ensure that all parties are treated equally and fairly ensure that the rights of all stakeholders are understood. Applying social marketing principles - the role of managers, policy makers and practitioners Public health programme managers, planners, policy makers and front line public health workers all have a key role to play in both deciding when to apply social marketing and ensur ing that interventions are delivered to a high standard. Without senior management and policy level support, implementation staff will find it hard to use and sustain social marketing interventions. [ 27] The first key task for public health programme manag ers is to familiarise themselves with the key social marketing concepts set out in this guide. The second key task is to consider when it is appropriate to use a social marketing approach to influence behaviour. The third key task is to encourage staff to develop their understanding of s ocial marketing and support their efforts. Public health programme managers can do this by: investing in training for staff in s ocial marketing theory and practice investing in sco ping work to develop intervention plans based on epidemiology, demographics, citizens' insight and understanding, evidence reviews and ethical considerations encouraging the development of s ocial marketing case studies and research projects to build exper ience and add to the evidence base encouraging the development of audience insight and segmentation to help target interventions encouraging the development of clear and specific behavioural programme objectives that can be measured and tracked over time ( SMART approach) engaging people and other stakeholders in developing interventions that go beyond information giving and include other forms and types of interventions such as service redesign requiring implementation staff to produce clear written plans that include both project management and evaluation strategies ensuring that learning from programmes informs planning and is shared.

Applying social marketing principles Introduction This part of the ECDC Social Marketing guide sets out a basic 'how to' guide about applying social marketing concepts and approaches in the planning, implementing and evaluating of public health prevention and control programmes. Public health programme managers and practitioners using this guide will gain a better understanding of how social marketing can help them develop and implement behaviour change interventions. For those already familiar with social marketing concepts and approaches, this guide will serve as a useful checklist for key activities. Those with less experience will need to supplement the information provided here with support materials listed in the resource section and with advice from more experienced colleagues and con sultants. The guide uses a logical s ocial marketing action framework that includes four action steps: scope, test, enact and, learn and act (Figure 8 ). Figure 8 . A four-step s ocial m arketing a ction f ramework 6 [1] For each action step, representative t asks, activities to address each task and support 'tools' are identified and described (see Table 3 ). Most professionals tend in reality not to follow a set structured approach to developing, delivering and evaluating interventions intended to influence behaviour changes. This social marketing action framework accepts this reality . Instead of setting out a fixed set of planning steps it sets out a basic planning framework and then supplements this with a compendium of tools that can be used by professionals in a flexible way that best suits the particular challenges they face. Short c ase studies, with examples from communicable disease prevention and control initiatives, illustrate how key tasks and activities may be applied. Tools described include a variety of checklists and workflow sheets that can help public health programme managers and practitioners track processes and progress of the activities they choose to undertake. Copies of all the worksheets described are available in Part 3 of this guide. 6This planning cycle builds on the STELa model (www.stelamodel.com) which was developed as a response to the need for a simple yet robust model that c ould be applied by practitioners and those not trained in formal planning systems and procedures [1].

Scoping Tasks All steps of the s ocial marketing action framework are important. However, this step is most often ignored or minimis ed. Public health programme managers and practitioners, particularly those that are new to s ocial marketing, often start generating solutions before a deep understanding and insight into the target audience's beliefs, understa nding, and behaviour have be en achieved. Investing time in scoping is critical and helps identify clear and appropriate behavioural objectives from the start , thus avoiding many of the common difficulties associated with delivering behaviour change initiatives. The scope step has five key tasks: setting goals and SMART objectives analysing situation and influencing factors understanding target audience(s) developing exchange proposition(s) selecting marketing interventions. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 22 Task 1 - Setting goals and SMART objectives This task involves three activities . Activity 1 - Explain why action is needed. S et out why action is needed on the identified social issue. A useful approach is to identify a problem and look at the scale of the problem and its social, health, service, cost and political consequences (see Tool 1). Activity 2 - Identify the target groups and beha viours you want to change . Identify the specific audience who will be the primary targets of your intervention and the behaviours you want to influence - change, modify, develop or sustain (see Tool 2). The key assumption made here is that changing behavio urs of this group will help solve the problem identified. Activity 3 - Set objectives that can be measured . Develop a set of SMART behavioural objectives as listed below (Use Tool 2 and 3 to support this activity) : Specific: precise - not open to different interpretations. Measurable: c an observe and collect objective measures. Achievable: w ith the resources available. Reliable: c onsistent, relevant, can be gathered. Time bound: m easured within the time frame of the intervention. N.B. Interventions which aim to measure behaviour changes will need time as behaviour change can be a long proc ess. Example - Measles vaccination - problem scale and impact summary Scale - how big is a problem - how many children are unvaccinated or under vaccinated? Social consequences - parents avoid socialising in public places for fear of contracting infection. Health consequences - 20% of children with measles in UK, for example, need hospitalisation. [2] Service consequences - the number of cases of measles fill up hospital beds. Cost consequences - the cost of measles cases far outstrips costs of mass vaccination and adverse effects [3]. We should also consider other economic costs such as those associated with loss of work time and emotional costs. Example - Health care provider vaccine uptake communication capacities Multiple studies [4, 5, 6,] show that in all European Union (EU) countries, healthcare providers (HCPs) are identified as the most important and trusted source of information on how to be protected from vaccine - preventable diseases. This is particularly true for parents with the most questions and concerns. A 2013 study [7], supported by ECDC, utilised primary and secondary research to identify behaviour changes that would help h ealthcare providers help parents to want and get their children protected by vaccination as a desired beha vioural goal and outcome, particularly those in population groups whose children are currently un- and under -vaccinated. Three key behaviours emerged from the research . 1. Use t wo-way communication - healthcare provider communication, often due to time co nstraints, was generally too focused on one- directional communication and the sending of well -intentioned but uniform messages to all. HCPs were advised to place more emphasis on dialogues - two-way conversations - which first elicit information about pare nts' specific concerns and anxieties and then adapt and customise messages to the identified needs of individuals and groups. 2. Keep the focus on protection - while vaccine safety issues need to be directly and clearly addressed and reassurance given where parental concerns exist, parents and other experts called for HCPs to keep the focus of vaccination discussions on the benefits of protec tion. People need to fully understand that when they get their children vaccinated that they are protecting them, an d the communities in which they live, from serious and potentially deadly diseases. 3. Create effective design and reconfiguration of services - stakeholders uniformly reported a need for improving the design and provision of services and delivery systems. Advice calls for more attention to be paid to costs, location, staffing, transport, scheduling and timing as key determinants of vaccination programme uptake and success. ' Vaccination journeys ' need to be made easier. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 23 Task 2 - Analysing situation and influencing factors This task involves four activities . Activity 1 - Perform a situation analysis . Before initiating any intervention it is useful to identify key issues that may impact on your proposed programme /campaign/action or on the receptivity of your target audiences. This activity involve s developing a subjective list of factors which may influence the interventions. A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis is one tool that can help identify relevant issues. Use Tool 4 to support this activity. An individual or small group can develop a SWOT analysis, but it will be more effective if you take advantage of many stakeholders. Each person or group offers a diff erent perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of your program me and has different experiences of both. It would also be useful to undertak e a PESTLE (Political, Environmental, Social, Technological, Legal and Ethical issues) analysi s (see http://pestleanalysis.com and Tool 5). Situational factors identified should be prioriti sed [8] (weighted) according to the likel ihood and the level of impact t hey may have . Activity 2 - Perform a competition analysis. In addition to looking at situational issues affecting progra mmes, it is useful to look at enabling factors and barriers to adopting the behaviour (s) you are promoting . You should analyse what or who may be influencing the target audience to act in a way that is detrimental or positive. Strategies and intervention plans can then be developed to address these influencing factors. Tools 6 and 7 can be used to support this activity. Example - Measles vaccination - SMART o bjectives When setting up a s ocial marketing intervention in support of a MMR programme, for example, it is helpful to identify how the behaviours that specific audiences need to take up in order to achieve the goals of the programme will be measured. Two examples of a SMART behavioural objective related to such a programme are: During 2015 over 95% of invited parents living in Town X will bring their child to their allotted vaccination clinic appointment. During 2015 over 95% of parents living in Town X will attend their follow up invitation appointment. Task 1: Setting goals and SMART objectives Activity support t oolbox Tool 1.

See Part 3 for full compendium of tools including recording forms, works heets and checklists Example - SWOT analysis related to vacc ination programme 'During September 2002, Israel began its current revaccination program against smallpox, targeting previously vaccinated \"first responders\" among medical and emergency workers. In order to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses of this program and the conditions under which critical decisions were reached a SWOT analysis was conducted of the current Israeli revaccination program, designed to identify its intrinsic strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities for its success and threats against it. The SWOT analysis revealed a number of threats that may jeopardi se the success of the current program, chief among them the appearance of severe complications of vaccination. The finding of a lack of a generation of knowledge on smallpox vaccination highlight ed the need for improved physician education and dissipation of misconceptions that were prevalent in the public .' [9] Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 24 Activity 3 - Review evidence and data . Gather information about what is known about the issue(s) and how to tackle them from published and unpublished sources such as professional journals, case study reports, and interviews with others who have undertaken work in the field. ECDC, for example , has supported a wide variety of literature and experiential reviews of communicable disease prevention and control communication inter ventions. [13-17] Ethical and risk considerations should also be identified and noted, and any preliminary action such as seeking of ethical approval should be started. If major risks are identified preliminary plans to mitigate them should also be developed. Tools 8 and 9 can be used to support this activity . Activity 4 - Map and record assets . Identify all assets that can help you influence the behaviour amongst the target groups you are interested in. These assets may includ e: social networks, community, environmental, stakeholder and health service assets. Other assets also include all potential partner and stakeholder organisations and communities and individuals that could help with the implementation of the programme. All these could be used to tackle the problem. Tools 10 and 11 can be used to support this activity. Example - Barriers and enabling factors related to vaccination uptake Recent studies have identified the following barriers and enablin g factors to vaccination uptake [8, 10, 11, 12] : Enabling factors that encourage the uptake of vaccination (these may also be seen as strengths of programme) : feeling of safety and wellbeing associated with having protected your child community social nor m in favour of vaccination service is offered locally target group perceive the invitation letter favourably service is offered free of charge service is offered at convenient times follow up and reminders encourage attenders service staff are welcoming and encouraging. Barriers to taking the vaccination service (these may also be seen as obstacles to uptake) : Single working parents perceive difficulty in attending clinics due to their opening times Some parents perceive service as being slow and inefficient Community social norm amongst sub group not in favour of vaccination (e.g., anthroposophists thinking that vaccination is ' unnatural') Access to service is more difficult for some (e.g. Roma communities ) than the rest of populatio n Social media and some press reports highlight negative stories and myths about side effects Religious beliefs which preclude vaccination (e.g. Bible belt in Netherlands). Example - Gathering evidenc e on factors influencing health care providers' recommendations for vaccination A Dutch study [18] exami ning factors related to healthcare providers' intentions to recommend vaccinations to parents of young children revealed: 1) perceived responsibility to promote vaccines and discuss pro s and cons with parents (although this was usually not done if parents readily accepted the vaccination) . 2) attitudes toward vaccination were mainly positive, but doubts about National plans to vaccinate against diseases with a low perceived burden were raised. 3) organizational factors such as limited time and information can hamper discussions with parents; 4) relationship with parents are crucial and based mainly on communication to establish trust. Conclusions Health care providers were motivated to support the National Immunisation Programme but their intentions to recommend vaccinations were affected by the perceived relevance of the vaccines, by practical issues like limited time and by certain types of resistant parents. These results were used to inform additional studies, to test the magnitude and relative impact of these factors and to design interventions to address challenges raised. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 25 Task 3 - Understanding target audiences This task involv es two activities. Activity 1 - Gather t arget audience insights . Utilise qualitative and quantitative target audience research such as surveys, focus groups and observational studies to gather intelligence on target audience knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. T ools 12-15 can be used to support this activity. Activity 2 - Segment your audiences . Segmentation is the division of an audience you intend to address into groups who share similar bel iefs, attitudes and behavioural patterns. This approach goes beyond demographic, epidemiological and service uptake data -based targeting to include data about people's beliefs, attitudes, understanding and observed behaviours. Target audiences are segmente d using these data sets. Cluster people Example - Hidden assets Immunisation programmes can, for example, benefit from ' hidden ' contributions/resources/assets of many interested parties ( partners and stakeholders). These include: information materials published by public and private agencies, spaces in schools given over for vaccination sessions, ' free' public advertising, etc. by commercial sector partners in the retail sector or media companies. Community groups, and concerned parents can also help inform communities about the need for action. Task 2 - Analysing situation and influencing factors: activity support toolbox Tool 4. SWOT analysis of existing public health programme - use this tool to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your existing interventions and highlight the aspects of current work you may need to change. Tool 5. PESTLE analysis - use this tool to set out broader contextual issues that may impact on the programme or target audiences. Tool 6. Barriers and enabling factors tool - use this tool to identify what barriers you might need to address and what enabling factors may help you influence uptake of he alth behaviour. Tool 7. * Competition analysis map - use this tool to identify forms of competition that you may need to address to influence your target behaviour. Tool 8 . Key data summary - use this tool to summarise evidence from other research reviews about what is known about how to influence the behaviour you are interested in. Tool 9. * Key lessons from the evidence summary - use this tool to summarise learning from case studies and experience about what works to influence issue or the target group you are interested in. Tool 10. Other assets map - use this tool to assess and record all the assets that are available to assist your programme objectives. Tool 11. Partnership/stakeholder contribution record tool - use this tool to record the partners you want to work with and how they could help you deliver the behavioural programme. *priority tools NB: See Part 3 for full compendium of tools, including recording forms, worksheets and checklists Example - Measles vaccination uptake communication - advice from parents As part of the 'Let's talk about Protection' guid e development [7], insight gathering focus groups were held with parents, grandparents and c arers in several different European countries. When asked how healthcare providers can best build on their trustworthiness and make an effective case for being prot ected by vaccination they gave the following advice: do what you recommend others do. teach us about the risks of non- vaccination. tell stories as well as sharing scientific facts. take time to listen to our concerns and tell us about possible side effects and risks. don't ignore those of us who get immunised - we need reassuring and valuing as champions. don't be put off by our efforts to find out more. make vaccination easier to access and less stressful. redefine success (recognise that some may need more time than others to decide). help enhance our vaccination health literacy.

Tools 16 and 17 can be used to support this activity. Task 4 - Developing exchange propositions This task involves two activities. Activity 1 - Develop b ehaviour promotion strategy . Based on target audience insight and understanding, set out how the proposed behaviour will be positioned and promoted with the target audience(s). In the case of a positive behaviour change, such as vaccination, uptake may be promoted by focusing on what emotional and physical benefits will be attained and how costs, such as inconvenient times, might be reduced . Tools 18 and 19 can be used to support this activity . It is often useful to think of the benefits associated with the behaviour as a product. Th e core product is the actual value or benefit people get from taking the action ; the actual product is the physical object of experience for example, an injection or pill; the augmented product is everything that is associated with the product , such as the way a service is provided, the way that staff act and communicate with people taking up a service. Example - Low measles uptake populations - segmenting audiences In his study of measles outbreaks in Europe, Muscat [19] descri bes three categories of reasons for low immuni sation coverage : poor access to healthcare \u2014 a major factor driving under- vaccination among vulne rable communities (e.g., Roma, Trave llers, migrant populations) . opposition to vaccination based on the community's belief system, among those people and communities who adopt alternative health practices based on its religious, philosophical or medical belief systems (e.g. Anthroposophists). lack of information, false information, fear, d istrust, competing priorities, causing hesitancy, delay, omission and opting out of the recommended vaccination schedule. The causes of non -vaccination in these cases are multiple and complex (and parents in this category would need to be further segmented). Task 3 - Understanding target audience(s): activity support t oolbox Tool 12. Audience differentiation tool - use this t ool to describe the audiences you are seeking to influence. Tool 13. * Current b ehavi our a nalysis tool- use this tool to record current behaviours both positive and negative as this will help you develop insight about the target audiences and how to help them. Tool 14. Behaviour c hange theory i nsight s ummary: record relevant models and theories - use this t ool to set out what is known using behavioural theory and models about what m ight be influencing behaviour and potential intervention points. Tool 15. *Audience insight data s ummary l og - use this tool to r ecord a summary of all the da ta and research you have about the audiences you want to influence. Tool 16. Initial segmentation definition tool- use this tool to describe each sub segment of the population that you have identified or think exists. Tool 17. Initial segmentation - use this tool to s et out you r initial segmentation of each target audience group including their behaviour and attitudes to the recommended behaviour. *priority tools NB. S ee Part 3 for full compendium of tools, including recording forms, worksheets and check lists Example - Promoting vaccination: 'product' benefits Core product: Feeling of safety and wellbeing associated with having protected your child. Actual product: Received vaccination that will protect child from measles. Augmented product: Easy access to the service, friendly and welcoming staff, who can also help with other health issues. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 27 Activity 2 - Making the case for compliance. In the case of a refusal or reluctance to take up services, set out how the benefits of compliance could be maximised and the costs of noncompliance could increase. In the case of non-rational choice situations, set out how the chosen environment could be structured, or what policy or service transformation (simple or comprehensive) could be introduced to encourage com pliance. Tools 20 and 21 can be used to support this activity. Task 5 - Selecting marketing interventions This task involves two activities. Activity 1. Select intervention forms and t ypes. This activity is focused on selecting which combination of intervention 'types' and 'forms' will be used to assist the adoption of the desired behaviours that you want to influence . 'Types' of intervention (see Figure 9 ) include: controls (laws and regulations); information (e.g. leaflets, SMS appointment reminders); environmental or system design changes (e.g. timing or location of servi ces); educational (e.g. continuing medical education for providers on antimicrobial diseases); support (e.g. providing health mediators to support poorly reached populations). 'Forms' of intervention (s ee Figure 10 and discussion Part 1 ) focus on use of incentives and penalties used to reinforce messages and increase compliance. These include a variety of nudges, smacks, hugs or shoves. Figure 10. Five t ypes of interventio n [20] Example - Assisting behaviour change Often people are too busy to actively consider all the actions and choices they have. To help physicians to follow infection control protocols and read reviews of antibiotic prescribing, nurses may add reminder notes or flags to patient's medical records to remind physicians to do a review of what is being prescribed. Some hospitals have found that providing a shelf for staff to put their papers by hand washing facilities increases compliance. Task 4 - Developing exchange proposition(s): activity support toolbox Tool 18. Price/ exchange development tool - use this t ool to set out the benefits and cost s of what you are proposing to each target segment. Tool 19. Product/s ervice descriptor and benefits record - use this t ool to set out in more detail the benefits you will be promoting . Tool 20.

This wil l help you develop promotional tactics that are consistent and based on the data and evidence you have gathered. *priority tools NB: S ee Part 3 for full compendium of tools, including recording forms, worksheets and checklists Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 28 Figure 11. Four intervention forms [ 1] Tools 22 -25 can be used to support this activity. A mix of ' types' and 'forms' of interventions, customi sed for each target segment that you want to influence , has been found to be most effective [1]. Activity 2 - Do intervention cost benefit analysis. When you develop your plans, y ou will also need to consider the ' types' and 'forms' of intervention that give the best value for money and return on investment in terms of the lowest cost for the biggest behavio ural response. Example - Selecting interventions to reduce antimicrobial resista nce [21] ECDC develope d communication toolkits for a variety of target audience in support of Antibiotic Awareness Day (18 November). The primary care prescriber toolkit offers advice on how campaign organisers could use a mix of different intervention methods to engage with pr imary care prescribers so as to promote appropriate and responsible use of antibiotics. There is information, education and support materials provided aimed at encouraging and empowering primary care prescribers to follow prescription guidelines for antibi otics and to provide them with the necessary information, messages and tools to inform patients about the risks of antibiotic resistance and direct their patients towards appropriate use of antibiotics and alternative treatments for viral infections such a s common colds and flu. Example - Cost -benefit of intervention Building sustainable programmes requires understanding how resources should be best allocated and making decisions about reallocations based on cost -benefit, returns on investment and value for money analysis. This is especially important when applying a new form of intervention that has not been rigorously evaluated; e.g. m ass media campaigns or direct mail promotions may prove to be less cost - effective than face -to-face communication about a vaccination programme to encourage the uptake of the service. Task 5 - Selecting marketing interventions : activity support toolbox Tool 22. *Final intervention description - use this tool to describe every type of intervention that your data, research, behavioural modelling and insight research indicates might work.

Test tasks This st ep can involve developing prototypes, test ing promotions and experiments and it culminates in a report recommending what mix of interventions should be developed into a full implementation plan. M ethods of collecting and analysing data for evaluation purposes can also be tested and developed during this stage. The k ey tasks in this step are focused on testing initial inter vention ideas and concepts to see how well they perform. The test step has one task: Pre testing and piloting Task 6 - Pre-testing and piloting This task involves two activities. Activity 1 - Test each potential intervention and hypothesis that you have developed with representative target populations. This planni ng should include the development of an experimental design and address any ethical issues raised. T ools 27-29 can be used to support this activity. Example - Prototyping A prototype of this guide was developed and tested through review by a group of co mmunication, infectious disease, social marketing and risk communication experts as well as a group of potential end- users (public health programme managers and practitioners). A common set of questions guided the review . Recommendations were analysed by the authors and a second draft was sent around for comment before finalisation. Prototyping is a system development method usually employed when it is difficult to obtain exact requirements from the customer or when a new product or concept is being develo ped. The advantages of this model* include: the user gets a proper clarity and 'feel' of the prototyped product and can suggest changes and modifications; It is particularly useful when the content of the product may be new or unfamiliar to the potential target audience. Without a prototype, for example, 'S ocial Marketing illiterate ' users would not be good at specifying their requirements, nor could they explain properly about what they expect from the product. When work is venturing into a new field of endeavo ur or work is carried out with a new target audience/ beneficiary a prototype approach can help into gaining insights and adjust accordingly the product/ tool. Sometimes it helps to demonstrate the value of the concept before great investments are m ade. It reduces risk of failure, as potential risks can be identified early and mitigation steps can be taken. Iteration between development team and client provides a very good and conductive environment during the project. The main disadvantages of the prototype approach relate to the slowness of process and the need for ongoing iterative feedback between developers and clients. * Adapted from: Prototype Model: Advantages and Disadvantages http://www.ianswer4u.com/2011/11/prototype -model - advantages -and.html#axzz2mtopldu1 Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 30 Activity 2 - Report on the impact of the pilot programme. Report s should include information on the immediate effect of the intervention/s on issues such as knowledge gain, attitude and beliefs. They should a lso measure impact on short -term behaviours and systems efficiency such as the cost of generating interest in the programme and costs of different methods of generating contact with the intervention or short -term behavioural action.

Enact task This st ep is focused on implementing and managing an intervention pla n based on the findings of the scoping st ep and on the results and learning from the t esting step. At the beginning of this st ep a full social marketing implementation plan will be produced together with a clear budget and evaluation strategy that will include details about how the programme will be managed, how it will report, and how it will manage both risks and opportunities. The plan will outline the ways the programme will be monitored for its impact and efficiency , how it will be evaluated and how it will report back to funders, sponsors, and stakeholder and target groups. The Enact step has two tasks: planning implementation initiating and managing implementation . Task 7 - Planning implementation Building on the outcomes of the pilot project and the scoping findings and decisions, t his task focuses on developing a full social marketing plan . This task involves one activity . Activity 1 - Intervention plan This plan should include: Problem statement and situation analysis. Intended audience segm entation, SMART behavioural objectives for the programme and how these will be measured. T ool 30 can be used to support this activity. Details of each product or service that you will use in the full programme. Tools 31 -34 can be used to support this activity. Anticipated impact and outcomes for the selected target audiences over a designated time frame. Budget which set s out the resources required from main sponsors, partners and stakeholders and how they will be deployed against the intervention and marketing mix you have proposed and how th e budget will be allocated to achieve the agree d objectives of the intervention. Tools 35 and 36 can be used to support this activity. Evaluation strategy including measures of the short -term change ( impact evaluation), the efficiency of interventions ( process evaluation) and the desired behaviour ( outcome evaluation). Selected indicators are listed below. Selected process, impact and outcome evaluation indicators Process evaluation. Indicators: How many people took part in or took advantage of a service (e.g. number vaccinated) that was offered? How many people were contacted (e.g. number invited for vaccination)? Impact evaluation. Indicators: data on immediate impact of the work. For example: reported increase in knowledge, reported behaviour or an imm ediate increase in the take up of a service. (e.g. percent increase in vaccination uptake by specified group over 6 -month period following intervention). Outcome evaluation. Indicators: data on the longer term effects of the project, observed behaviour and its consequences. For example: reduced incidence of measles in community.

Activity 1 - Manage partners, risk and opportunities. Track that each partner has delivered on what they promised and record how well they have been engaged with the programme . Tools 37 and 38 can be used to support this activity. Review and manage risks associated with the project. Tool 39 can be used to support this activity. Undertake opportunity spotting, horizon scanning and programme adjustment . Tool 40 can be used to support the recording of potential opportunities and the identification of ways to exploit them . Activity 2 - Report on process . Gather process, impact, and outcome data. Record progress and setbacks, analyse and report. T ool 41 can be used to support the recording of this data at regular intervals. O rganise your reporting to sponsors and stakeholders. Tool 42 can be used to support this activity . Track and manage the intervention budget ensuring that there are no significant cost overruns or underspends and that the intervention is being delivered in th e most cos t effective way possible. T ool 43 can be used to support recording and summaris ing of budgetary data. Example The ECDC 'Let's Talk about Protection' guide [7] was translated and adapted into Bulgarian (as well as Czech, Hungarian and Romanian ) through a rigorous structured proc ess which involved national language and public health experts as well as end- users (e.g. Roma health mediators and GPs) throughout the review process. The adapted material has now been introduced for use (enacted) in three different Roma communities. The introduction of the materials is being accomplished within a research evaluation protocol approach that gathered pre -intervention information (baseline data) about knowledge attitudes and behaviours of both HCPs and Roma parents and grandparents living in ' pilot' communities. The impact of the use of materials will be tracked over time (with both quantitativ e and qualitative studies; e.g. post-intervention studies, vaccination upt ake rates, etc.) and compared with similar control communities.

Learn and a ct tasks This step of the social marketing process is focused on gathering and disseminating findings about the impact of the programme as well as its efficiency. It also seek s to help practitioners and their agencies learn from the programme about what worked well and what did not . This information can be used to inform decision -making process es related to subsequent follow -on or new programmes. The learn and act step has two tasks: evaluat ing and reporting reviewing and building learning. Task 9 - Evaluating and reporting This t ask involves two activities . Activity 1 - Evaluate outcomes . Utilise your SMART objectives developed in Task 1 Activity 3 as the basis for evaluation. Follow the evaluation plan developed in the enacting step. Record the outcomes from your individual interventions and the overall programme. Use Tool 44 to support this activity.

The key focus of this activity is to report to stakeholders and funders and present a set of recommendations based on what you have found works and what does not in terms of influencing behaviour. Use Tool 46 to summarise the recommendatio ns that flow from your programme evaluation. Task 10 - Reviewing and building learning The key purpose of this final task is to ensure that the learning gained as part of the evaluation of your programme and individual elements of it are used to help shape future interventions and allocation of budgets. Ultimately this should result in better performance in the next wave of implementation. This task involves two activities. Activity 1 - Identify follow -up actions . Set out actions that should be taken by policy makers, planner professional staff and community groups based on your evaluation recommendations. Use Tool 47 to support this activity. Identify ways to disseminate the results and recommendations that you have developed. Use Tool 48 to support this activity. Activity 2 - Identify future implications . Set out an agreed plan for how your organisation and those of stakeholders can adapt and improve based on the learning and evaluation of the programme. Use Tool 49 to support this activity. Reasses s PESTLE issues in the light of findings from your evaluation and any implications of these for future strategy or implementation. Use Tool 50 to support this activity. Example - Evaluation plan - Testing utility of the us e and impact of vaccination guide and support materials on knowledge attitudes and behaviours *. The target audiences for the evaluation research will be healthcare providers, health mediators and Roma parents and grandparents of children up to 18 years of age in the three selected study communities and one control community. Healthcare providers include doctors (GPs, paediatricians and school doctors, if appropriate), nurses (school and office- based) and inspectorate epidemiologists responsible for vaccina tion management and delivery. The evaluation component will be performed pre- and post -interventions. The aims of the evaluation are to: assess the impact of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to childhood vaccination amongs t community based healthcare providers ( HCPs) and health mediators(HMs) assess the material's utility as perceived by GPs, HMs and regional health inspectorate epidemiologists to communicate on immunisation conduct research on current knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to childhood vaccination amongst Roma parents and grandparents i n study and control communities the collected data on baseline indicators would create a possibility to measure the changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviours after one year of using the materials by HPs. *This is based on the evaluation plan for an ECDC -supported project in Bulgaria testing the utility of the adapted version of Let's Talk about Protection.

The features within the list are drawn from the references listed at the end of t his guide. Social marketing planning review checklist Is the plan based on an established and/or logical planning template? Scope Are clear aims and measurable behavioural objectives set out in the programme plan together with the target audience(s) and segments that will be the focus of the intervention? Are key barriers, enabling factors and other risks identified in the programme plan together with what actions will be taken to address these factors? Does the programme plan set out the political, poli cy, managerial and institutional commitment to the programme? Does the programme team capture the evidence about effective practice from reviews and case studies, observational data of actual behaviour ? Are target audience demographic s, behavioural, risk and psychographic data , for example, beliefs and attitudes, gathered and analysed to formula te insight and help develop interventions that target groups will respond to? Does the programme plan set out a clear rationale for the types of intervention select ed for the programme and why the particular mix of interventions has been selected? Does the programme plan also indicate the theoretical perspectives and models that have been used for planning that are congruent with the form, focus and context of the i ntervention ? Does the programme plan demonstrate how target group(s) will be involved in needs assessment, target setting and strategy development? Does the plan also demonstrate how target groups will be engaged in the delivery and evaluation of the programme? Testing Does the programme plan set out how prototype interventions or pilots will be tested and used to develop full -scale programmes ? Is a clear expected return on investment case set out to justify the level of planned investment? Does the prog ramme plan set out how the programme will be funded to achieve agreed levels of impact and how will it be sustainable over the reco mmended time scale for delivery? Enacting Do programme plans also set out key process checking mechanisms that include and assess quality measures and ethical practice? Do programme plans set out how coalitions, stakeholders, partners and interest groups will be engaged over the lifetime of the intervention? Does the programme plan also set out the mechanism for coordinated action between international, national regional and local delivery, and how decision making, governance and coordination of the programme will operate? Are evaluation, performance management, learning and feedback mechanisms clear in the programme plan? Does evaluation encompass short -term impact measures, process measures of efficiency and quality and outcome evaluation related to the specific behavioural and social outcome objectives of the programme? Are all programme plans recorded and published? Lear ning and acting Have outcomes of programme been used to inform subsequent organisational planning and development?

The characteristics of s uccessful behavioural intervention planning Programmes aimed at influencing human beliefs, attitudes and behaviour are complex in nature. While it is not possible to develop an exact formula that can be universally applied for delivering population -focused behaviour programmes that will result in success every time in every situation, there is an emerging set of principles that can help us in the development and application of such health interventions. There are a number of universal underlying health intervention planning principles that have been shown to increase the likelihood of success i.e. i rrespective of the health issue, target group, targeted b ehaviour or country context [2 -3]. These characteristics in many ways set out a counterpoint to those weaknesses of many social programmes outlined in Table 1 . Although specific programmes themselves cannot often be exactly replicated, evidence derived from academic and policy literature, field trials and programme evaluations demonstrate that there are a number of common characteristics that most successful programmes ex hibit. The sources of evidence range for what good social programme intervention planning is considerable. Many s ocial marketing texts [4 -7] set out key planning elements. Other sources come from reviews of good social interventio n design [8] and generic social programme implementation [9] through to specific guidance in ar eas such as health improvement [10] environmental interventions [11 -12] and behavioural design [13 -14]. There are also a number of specific planning guides and checklists that have been d eveloped for planning specific aspects of social marketing such as ho w and when to use of new media [15] , engaging with corpo rate partners and stakeholders [16] , enabling community empowerment [17] and using advocacy programmes [18], cultural change [19], and the use of mass media [20] . A good summary of much of this planning and other social programme design considerations is encapsulated in the Medical Research Council (MRC) [21] guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions. This guidance sets out a number of helpful questions that planners and researchers should address when seeking to set up such programmes. In the planning and early development steps of a programme these questions include: Are you clear about what you are trying to do, wh at outcome you are aiming for, and how you will bring about change? Does your intervention have a coherent theoretical basis? Have you used this theory systematically to develop the intervention? Can you describe the intervention fully, so that it can b e implemented properly for the purposes of your evaluation, and replicated by others? Does the existing evidence, ideally collated in a systematic review, suggest that it is likely to be effective or cost effective? Can it be implemented in a research setting, and is it likely to be widely implementable if the results are favourable The MRC paper recommends that, if any of these questions cannot be fully answered, there is further development work needed before projects are initiated. With regard to pilot ing and feasibility studies the guidance sets out additional questions that need to be considered: Have you done enough piloting and feasibility work to be confident that the intervention can be delivered as intended? Can you make safe assumptions about effect sizes and variability and rates of recruitment and retention in the main evaluation study? What design are you going to use, and why? Is an experimental design preferable and if so, is it feasible? If a convent ional parallel group randomised controlled trial is not possible, have you considered alternatives such as cluster randomisation or a stepped wedge design? Have you set up procedures for monitoring delivery of the intervention and overseeing the conduct o f the evaluation? The paper also recommends that a focus on process evaluation is a good investment to explain discrepancies between expected and observed outcomes. Such an evaluation will also help build understanding about how the intervention context i nfluenced outcomes. Including an economic evaluation will likewise make the results of the evaluation much more useful for decision -makers. TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 93 The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [22] has also developed a set of planning guidance for behavioural interventions, recommendations that cover much of the same ground as the MRC guidance, specifically NICE sets out three core actions related to generic planning and intervention design principles: Carefully plan interventions and programmes aimed at changing behaviour, taking into account the local and national context and working in partnership with recipients. Interventions and programmes should be based on a sound knowledge of community needs and should build upon the existing skills and r esources within a community. Equip practitioners with the necessary competencies and skills to support behaviour change, using evidence- based tools. (Education providers should ensure courses for practitioners are based on theoretically informed, evidence- based best practice.) Evaluate all behaviour change interventions and programmes, either locally or as part of a larger project. Wherever possible, evaluation should include an economic component A2. The importance of s pecific , measurable, behavioural objectives It is possible to add to the list of core planning recommendations a further common characteristic associated with effective public health planning; the need for clarity of purpose. Programmes that seek to influence health behaviour require a set of clear measurable behavioural objectives that are achievable within the timescales and resources of the programme. However, as already discussed, often programmes have unrealistic, or at the opposite extreme, no clear measurable objectives identified. O bjectives need to be based on thorough research about what is achievable, realistic and ethically and socially acceptable. Having no clear goal or picking the wrong goal is a common mistake that organisations often make. A fundamental principle for s ocial marketing planning is that organisations need to focus on developing a set of unambiguous behavioural goals and the means of measuring the achievement or progress toward these goals as well as focusing on measuring and evaluating process activity. Clear ou tcome targets that accurately measure behaviour and its health impacts are essential elements of any s ocial marketing interventions. A3. Social m arketing planning models For many social marketers the 4P's of marketing ( product, price place promotion) are s till a key element of social marketing planning [5, 23] . The 4Ps concept has real strengths in that it presents four issues that a marketer needs to address when developing and implementing a programme. Advocates of this model stress that it ensures that p rogramme planners go beyond just thinking about promotions and consider issues such as what the benefit of the health behaviour is ( core product) as well as any tangible product there might be such as a malarial net. The model also encourages planners to t hink about the cost of adopting behaviours ( price) and the channels of persuasion that should be used ( place). However many leading social marketers [24, 25, 26] believe it is time that the 4Ps were consigned to the history of s ocial marketing. One of the big weaknesses these au thors point out is that the 4Ps approach starts from the perspective of the social marketing planner and not the client. When using the 4Ps approach it is also possible to omit a consideration of wider influences on behaviour such as environmental and economic factors. However, the 4Ps are still a helpful conceptual model that can help in the development of social marketing plans alongside other conceptual models and tools. In addition to the 4Ps model there are a number of specifical ly developed social marketing operational planning frameworks and models that practitioners can either use or adapt to their own situation. Some of the best know planning models are the five- stage Tota l Process Planning (TPP) model [27] that consist of fiv e stages of planning, see Figure 1. The six -phase CDCynergy Social Marketing edition tool [28] can be se en in Figure 2. This model is a comprehensive model that sets out six phases of planning and is accompanied by a large section of tools and reference ma terial, in 2012 CDC produced a simplified version for smaller scale projects.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The WHO COMBI planning model [29] - see Figure 3 - is another well -known and widely used planning model that is focused specifically on health issues and has been developed for application in developing world settings.

WHO Department of Global Capacities Alert and Response. Geneva. There are numerous other models available [30, 31, 32] . In addition to these models many specialist social marketing companies and institutions have developed their own planning models frameworks. Each of these planning models set out a number of steps that proceed from analysis through development and into implementation and then evaluation. Each of these planning models also has advantages and disadvantages. Some are very simple and easy to apply others are more comprehensive and require more effort. Key issues to consider when selecting a social marketing planning model is the scale and complexity of the behaviour you are seeking to influence. Social ma rketing can be applied to small -scale local projects with little or no budgets or to large- scale sustained international programmes. When a large- scale investment is being made in a social marketing programme it will requires a more thorough planning approach and reporting process. Many of these planning models have been influenced by a planning process known as 'Logical Frameworks'. Log Frames as they are often known have their roots in military planning [33] . The Log Frame approach [34] is popular TECHNICAL DOCUMENT Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners 95 because it uses a simple visual framework with key headings to describe a logical and staged process and a set of key task. Log Frames requires practitioners to identify and describe a number of key elements of their intended intervention. These include: The issues being addressed and the context within which the intervention takes place. The inputs - resources and activities - required in order to achieve intervention objectives. Outputs (e.g. in terms of target groups to be engaged, roads built, products developed) Outcomes (i.e. short and medium -term results, such as changes in traffic flow levels and model shif ts) Impacts (i.e. long- term results such as better quality of life, improved health, environmental benefits etc.) Figure A 4. Components of an i ntervention log frame Source: Fry Consultants Incorporated (1970). Final Report Contract No. csd -2510 July 24 . Project evaluation and the project appraisal and reporting system. Volume one. Agency for International Development. The Log Frame process, see F igure 4, also involves developing consensus amongst stakeholders about interventions, outcomes and impacts. L og Frames emphasise the identification of 'Objective Verifiable Indicators (OVI's) and Means of Verification (MOV) to ensure that what is expected to happen is tracked and reported on. As with other planning models, Log Frames can have the danger that they are sometimes rather rigidly applied and so stifle the opportunity to react to changes in circumstances outside the programme plan. The other key problem associated with a number of these models is that like comprehensive health promotion planning models [35, 36] , they are made difficult by their comprehensive approach to defining problems and seeking comprehensive solutio ns to complex problems. Social m arketing takes an alternative position by seeking to break health challenges down into smaller challenges and developing systematic interventions to tackle them one by one. A4. The need for s ustained and outcome focused budgeting When investing in behavioural change programmes there is a threshold point that must be reached in terms of population awareness, attitude and action before any return on investment can be measured. In an increasingly competitive environment for attention and engagement, public programmes that aim to bring about positive social behaviour are often not funded to a sufficient level tha t they are able to bring about a measurable impact on their intended target audiences. The amount to be invested to achieve measurable impact on behaviour in target segments is a key factor to be determined in the development phase of any planned programme. A second key consideration is the time frame over which an investment will need to be maintained to achieve the targets of the programme. If funders are not able to commit sufficient funds over the required period they must be made aware that the impact of their more limited investment may be reduced further by a lack of perseverance. Impact over time is a key issue to be addressed when putting together a full business case for investing in behavioural change. A move towards outcome based budgeting can be aided by the adoption of what has been called the 'T hree step process', [37] for budget allocation to behavioural programmes. Rather than allocating a fixed amount of financial resources to scope, develop, implement and evaluate a programme it is more eff ective if budgets are allocated in three steps. First a budget should be allocated to scope an issue, to understand the problem audiences and the assets that exist or could be brought into play and the obstacles to success. The key output from this s coping phase is a report that sets out a clear statement of the problem and desired improvement, initial intervention propositions based on a review of evidence, data and market research and a costed plan for a 'development phase' to refine the proposed in terventions. The second step begins on completion of a scoping step. Based on the findings and recommendations of the scoping report commissioners should allocate a second budget for development. This phase will work up the proposals, undertake field test ing and refinement or if necessary redesign the proposed interventions so that they meet the requirements of the programmes and are acceptable to the target market and stakeholders. Social marketing guide for public health managers and practitioners TECHNICAL DOCUMENT 96 The third step commences after the development phase. A full business pla n should be developed that will form the basis of full and sustained funding allocation to scale up and fully implement the recommended interventions and evaluate their impact. If this three -step approach to funding is applied by and complemented by pract itioners in the public sector setting out the evidence for their recommendations, estimates of projected savings and value for money analysis the chances of well -executed behavioural intervention will increase. Such an approach would also result in the development of a growing cost evidence base for social behavioural interventions th at would inform future planning and budgetary decision making. However the need to develop a greater focus on the design of efficient as well as cost effective programmes is no t without complexity as a number of economic factors will need to be taken into account when assessing the overall economic and return on investment impact of a programme. For example in the health field: There are also wider economic benefits to individua ls and society, arising from reductions in the effects of passive smoking in non -smokers and savings to the health service and the employer. These wider benefits are often omitted from economic evaluations of cessation interventions, which consequently ten d to underestimate the true value for mon ey afford ed by such Programmes [38]. Comprehensive econometric measures of s ocial marketing programme impacts are not simple to do but accessible guidance about how such evaluat ions can be has been developed [39].
