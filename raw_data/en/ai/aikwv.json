I love that this cleanses and polishes skin at the same time. It feels luxurious to use. It makes a real difference in the look and feel of my skin too. It is gentle and non-irritating but truly adds radiance and leaves my skin smooth. Even my tinted moisturizer goes on more smoothly. This ultra fine Polishing Balm is so gentle, and very moisturising! I love how smooth and brighter my skin looks when using this. It cleanses, polishes, and then leaves my skin so soft! It has a very light citrus scent and is self-emulsifying (needs very little water) and breaks down quickly, without leaving any residue. Love the ingredients, texture and results! So happy I tried it! This is truly a one of a kind and very unique cleansing balm/polish all in one. I've never seen anything like it and I'm a skincare snob. It does a phenomenal job of cleansing and getting rid of all my makeup, leaving my skin soft and smooth like a babies bottom. Highly recommended! I absolutely love the eco friendly packaging and soft & smooth texture of the balm. It feels gentle without causing any irritation to my sensitive skin. My skin feels soft and while moisturized after each use. I've never used crystal infused skincare and I must say that this was quite the luxurious experience. I did find the physical exfoliation with gemstones and bamboo micropowder to be a bit uncomfortable on dry skin, and so I do lightly dampen my face to reduce this. I love that this product provides both chemical and physical exfoliation. It strips my face of all dead skin and leaves it feeling smooth and moisturized. It has a light lemony scent with a viscous consistency. This is the most luxurious exfoliant I have ever used. Both chemical and physical it uses fruit enzymes and micropowder to gently exfoliate the skin leaving it feeling softer, smoother and more radiant. The sweet, fruity scent adds to the sensorial experience giving a spa like experience. The use of oils in this gorgeous exfoliant leaves the skin hydrated but not greasy THIS IS A FANTASTIC EXFOLIATOR!! Every now and then a product will really impress me...this is definitely one of them! The texture is VERY UNIQUE because of the fine balance of exfoliators & soothing oils. There is absolutely no greasy residue, just SOFT HEALTHY SKIN. I love it. I highly recommend "}
