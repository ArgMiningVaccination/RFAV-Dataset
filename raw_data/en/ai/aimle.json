Examples might include meditation to reduce stress, peppermint or ginger tea for nausea, or guided imagery to help relieve stress and pain during medical procedures. Many complementary treatments are unlikely to cause harm and won't interfere with your cancer treatment. Here are some examples: If you are thinking about using any method instead of standard evidence-based medical treatment, it is important to talk to your health care team first.
