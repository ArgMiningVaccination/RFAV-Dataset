The mission statement of the Florida Department of Health is \"to protect and promote the health of all residents and visitors in the state through organized state and community efforts, including cooperative agreements with counties.\" This report directly supports the mission of the department by identifying patterns and trends in the incidence of disease that are used as the scientific basis for development of disease control and prevention strategies and policies. Protection of the public's health from existing, emerging, and re-emerging diseases requires diligence in all aspects of public health. Our most important partners in identifying and characterizing emerging trends in disease are the physicians, nurses, laboratorians, hospital infection-control practitioners and other health care professionals who participate in reportable disease surveillance. Without their participation, our ability to recognize and intervene in emerging public health issues would be much more limited. Travel-related illness in Florida was a concern in 2010 and this report contains a special section on recent trends in travel-related illness. In 2010, an earthquake and subsequent cholera epidemic in Haiti presented significant potential for the importation of disease into the state. On January 12, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earth - quake struck in the area surrounding Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The Florida Department of Health and our disease control partners were able to quickly respond to this humanitarian crisis. Florida, as the U.S. state located closest to Haiti, became an initial focal point for assisting the federal repatriation and humanitarian parolee efforts. As the crisis developed, the Department worked to identify the introduction of cholera and prevent local transmission within Florida after an outbreak was identified in Haiti. The Department's response required the collaboration of county health departments, many bureaus, divisions and public health partners. This collabo - ration was essential to ensure an efficient and ef fective response to this state, national, and global concern. The Division of Disease Control and the Bureau of Epidemiology would like to thank the other program areas within the Florida Department of Health that contributed information to this report including the Bureau of Immunization, Bureau of HIV/AIDS, Bureau of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Prevention and Control, Bureau of Tuberculosis Control and Refugee Health, Bureau of Environmental Public Health Medicine, and the Bureau of Laboratories. Finally, many thanks are extended to the County Health Department staff and other public health professionals who are involved in reportable disease surveillance, either through disease control activi - ties, case investigations, data collection, or other essential functions. We hope readers will find this document useful when setting priorities for action at the individual and commu - nity level to prevent and control disease in Florida. Julia Gill, Ph.D., M.P.H.

Summarize annual morbidity from notifiable communicable and environmental diseases, and cancer in Florida; 2. Describe patterns of disease as an aid in directing future disease prevention and control ef forts; and, 3. Provide a resource to healthcare and public health authorities at county , state, and national levels. Report Format This report is divided into 8 sections: Section 1: Summary of Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and ConditionsSection 3: Summary of Foodborne Disease OutbreaksSection 4: Summary of Antimicrobial Resistance SurveillanceSection 5: Summary of Notable Outbreaks and Case InvestigationsSection 6: Recently Published Papers and ReportsSection 7: Summary of Cancer Data, 2008Section 8: Public Health Laboratory Status Report Data Sources Data presented in this report are based on reportable disease information received by county and state health department staff from physicians, hospitals, and laboratories throughout the state. Data on occurrence of reportable diseases in Florida were obtained through passive and sometimes active surveillance. Reporting suspect and confirmed notifiable diseases or conditions in the State of Florida is mandated under Section 381.0031, Florida Statutes (F.S.), and Chapter 64D-3, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.). People in charge of laboratories, practitioners, hospitals, medical facilities, or other locations providing health services (can include schools, nursing homes, and state institutions) are required to report diseases or conditions and the associated laboratory test results listed in the Table of Notifiable Diseases or Conditions, Chapter 64D-3, F.A.C. Reporting test results by a laboratory does not nullify the practitioner ' s obligation to also report the disease or condition. These data are the basis for providing useful information on reportable diseases and conditions in Florida to healthcare workers and policymakers, and would not be possible without the cooperation of the extensive network involving both private and public sector participants. 1. Passive surveillance relies on physicians, laboratories, and other healthcare providers to report diseases to the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) using a confidential morbidity report form, electronically , by telephone, or by facsimile. 2. Active surveillance entails FDOH staf f regularly contacting hospitals, laboratories, and physicians in an ef fort to identify all cases of a given disease. 3. Increasingly , information about cases of reportable diseases is passed from providers, especially laboratories, to the FDOH as electronic records, which occurs automatically . ReferencesSpecific references are noted appropriately throughout this report. The following reference was used for the majority of notifiable diseases and conditions contained in Section 2. David L. Heymann (ed.), Control of Communicable Diseases Manual , 19th ed., American Public Health Association Press, Washington, District of Columbia, 2008.Interpreting the Data This report should be interpreted in light of the following limitations: 1. Under-reporting Evaluations of infectious disease reporting systems have, in general, indicated that the completeness of reporting varies by disease. The less common, more severe reportable diseases such as bacterial meningitis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, botulism, anthrax, tuberculosis, and congenital syphilis are more completely reported than the more common but (individually) less severe diseases such as hepatitis A or campylobacteriosis. Variation in reported disease incidence at the local level probably reflects, to varying degrees, both differences in the true incidence of disease and differences in the vigor with which surveillance is performed. 2. Reliability of Rates All incidence rates in this report are expressed as the number of reported cases of a disease or condition per 100,000 population unless otherwise specified. Animal rabies is only reported as the number of cases or as the rate based on human population, because no reliable denominators exist for animal populations. Rates for diseases with only a few cases reported per year can be unstable and should be interpreted with caution. The observation of zero events is especially difficult to interpret. All rates in the report based on fewer than 19 events should be considered unreliable. This translates into a relative standard error of the rate of 23% or more, which is the cut-off for rate reliability used by the National Center for Health Statistics. 3. Reporting Period The data in this report are aggregated by the date the case was reported to the Bureau of Epidemiology for each of the years presented, based on standard weeks as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Week 1 of each year through week 52 of each year comprise the reporting year. Frequency counts included only cases reported during this time. In some cases, diseases reported in 2010 may have onset or diagnosis dates in 2009. 4. Case Definition Cases are classified as confirmed, probable, or suspected at the local level, using a published set of surveil - lance case definitions (Surveillance Case Definitions for Select Reportable Diseases in Florida, available at http://www.doh.state.fl.us/disease_ctrl/epi/surv/CaseDefinitions.html). For cases of selected diseases, these classifications are reviewed at the state level. In this report confirmed and probable cases have been included for all diseases, but no suspected cases have been included. 5. Place of Acquisition of Disease or Condition The distribution of cases among Florida counties is determined by the patient' s reported county of residence. Cases are allocated to their county of residence regardless of where they became ill or are/were hospital - ized, diagnosed, or exposed. Cases in people whose official residence is outside the state of Florida, but who became ill or are/were hospitalized or diagnosed in Florida, are not included. These cases are referred through an interstate reciprocal notification system to the state where the patient resides. 6. Population Estimates All population estimates are from the Community Health Assessment Resource Tool Set (CHARTS). The CHARTS system receives its estimates from the Florida Legislature's Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR). Estimates are updated once per year in the CHAR TS system. Note that previous editions of this report may show somewhat different populations for a given year than the ones shown here, as these estimates are revised periodically. xivxv7. Incomplete Case Information Certain analyses may not include all reportable cases of a specific disease due to incomplete case information. For graphs denoting month of onset, it is important to note that only those cases of disease for which an onset date could be determined are included.xvi Florida County BoundariesxviiTable A.

Furthermore, this statute provides that \"Periodically the Department shall issue a list of diseases determined by it to be of public health significance...and shall furnish a copy of said list to the practitioners...\". This list reflects diseases and conditions that were reportable in 2010. Updates may be made in future years; Annual Morbidity Reports for subsequent years will reflect changes in the list.

Case reports for acute diseases excluding HIV , STDs, and tuberculosis (TB) are entered into the state's reportable disease surveillance system, Merlin, by county health departments. Data included in the summary below is limited to cases reported in Merlin. This is a snapshot of all cases aggregated at the state level with a focus on where the disease was acquired. The proportion of illnesses that are acquired in particular states, countries, or jurisdictions differs by disease and is often discussed more in-depth in the individual disease summaries included in Section 2 of this report. Additionally , importation of disease is a significant factor in the epidemiology of TB. TB is not discussed in this snapshot but is covered extensively in the TB summary contained in Section 2. With the ease of international travel, as well as the large number of tourists that visit Florida each year , there is significant potential for the importation of disease to the state. Residents and non-residents alike are capable of introducing infectious diseases into Florida's population. Over the past ten years, the recorded number of cases of reportable disease where illness was determined to be acquired outside of Florida has risen steadily . However, when summarized by illness acquired domestically versus internationally it is apparent that the dramatic increase in non-Florida acquired illness is due to international travel (Figure 1). Illness associated with disease acquired in the U.S., but not in Florida has decreased over the past four years. Figure 1. Cases of Reportable Disease in Florida Residents where Illness was Aquired Outside of the State of Florida, by Acquistion Location, 2001-2010 Figure 1. Cases of Reportable Disease in Florida Residents where Illness was Acquired Outside of the State of Florida, by Acquisition Location, 2001-2010 05001,0001,5002,0002,500 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010Count of Cases Acquired in another U.S. state Acquired outside of the U.S. xxiiiCommon categories of travel include trips for pleasure and business. In addition to Florida residents who travel for pleasure or business, another category of international travel are those who travel to visit with friends and relatives (VFR). These populations are likely Florida residents whose family still resides in their country of origin. When visiting with family and friends, VFRs are likely to eat traditional foods, such as unpasteur - ized dairy products, which can pose a risk to their health. Additionally, VFRs are less likely to take certain precautions, such as taking anti-malarial medications, when traveling home because of a perceived lack of risk. Travel-related illness is also frequently associated with immigration. Florida is consistently ranked as one of the top six states in the U.S. Immigrants are screened for many infectious and chronic diseases upon entry into the country. All cases of reportable diseases are referred to the county health department and then reported as Florida residents. For cases of reportable diseases captured in Merlin, in addition to the import status of the case, information about the country of origin is also entered. There were a total of 1,984 cases of a reportable disease reported in 2010 which were listed as being acquired outside of the U.S. The highest proportion of cases listed as acquired outside of the U.S. were imported from Cuba (N=640), Haiti (N=253), Puerto Rico (N=54), China (N=50), India (N=45), Mexico (N=45), and the Dominican Republic (N=41). Figure 2 groups countries into larger geographic regions. Figure 2. Florida Cases or Reportable Diseases Acquired Outside of the U.S., by Region of Origin, 2010 Another area of significant morbidity are cases of infectious disease that are imported into Florida by a person who is traveling within the state but whose residence is outside of Florida. Because cases of reportable disease are classified according to the person's state of residence, cases of disease in travelers to Florida are not reflected in Florida's statistics and are not included in the other sections of this Annual Morbidity Statistics Report. It is estimated that over 82 million people visited Florida in 2010. Of those, approximately 71 million were from within the U.S., three million were from Canada, and eight million were from other international locations. These travelers may bring with them any number of infectious diseases. When ill individuals are identified, it is essential for public health to respond quickly and ef fectively to prevent continued transmission of the disease among other travelers as well as Florida residents. Measles is an example of a disease which commonly poses a threat to Florida residents from international travelers. Measles has become endemic in the United Kingdom and several other countries in Europe due to decreased numbers of individuals receiving vaccine. Figure 2. Cases or Reportable Diseases Acquired Outside of the U.S., by Region of Origin, Florida 2010 Europe 2% Africa 5% Central America 8% South America 8%Carribbean 61%Asia and Middle East 16% xxivDiseases which are commonly imported in travelers which require immediate public health action include measles, malaria, dengue, and Brucella (melitensis and abortus species) infections, to name a few. Specifically, malaria and dengue infections necessitate pesticide applications in the areas where the infected persons were near competent vectors. This reduces the risk that these diseases will be re-introduced to the state or to new areas of the state. For Brucella melitensis or abortus infections, it is essential to identify the travel history of individuals as well as establish other exposure information including livestock and un-pasteurized cheese exposures. Brucella melitensis and abortus infections have been eliminated in Florida and would cause significant economic impact to commercial livestock if they were re-introduced in the state. Several examples of imported disease investigations are discussed in-depth in Section 5: Summary of Notable Outbreaks and Case Investigations. These summaries include cholera cases imported from Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake, an investigation of malaria in airline staf f, which was acquired in Africa during a series of layovers, as well as measles in a traveler returning from Europe. However , the summaries in Section 5 do not cover all investigations that were conducted within the state associated with disease importation. On January 12, 2010, an earthquake occurred near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, creating enormous devastation. Florida's close proximity to Haiti resulted in >22,000 people entering Florida from Haiti as part of federal repatriation and humanitarian parolee efforts. Travel between Florida and Haiti is common and report - able diseases introduced by travelers returning from Haiti are identified every year . Because of the anticipated large post-earthquake influx of persons into Florida from Haiti, Florida enhanced surveillance ef forts. Merlin was used to document cases of reportable diseases in people coming to Florida who were in Haiti at the time of or after the earthquake, regardless of residency. The Outbreak Module within Merlin was used to capture data on Haiti travel, medical condition upon entry into the U.S., and citizenship. During the post-earthquake period, 51 cases in Florida residents and 31 cases in non-Florida residents were recorded. Please see Section 5 under \"Haiti\" for a detailed breakdown of the diseases captured in Merlin related to the Haiti earthquake.

That year, a total of 4,799 (14% of the U.S. total) AIDS cases were diagnosed in New York, followed by 4,392 (13%) in Florida and 3,760 (11%) in California. Cumulatively, however, Florida ranks third behind New York and California. In 2010, at least one AIDS case was reported in all but eight counties (Figure 1). Although the AIDS epidemic is widespread throughout Florida, the majority of cases were reported from eight counties: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas and St. Lucie, all reporting over 100 cases in 2010. These eight counties reported a combined total of 2,551 cases, or 74% of Florida's total reported cases in 2010 (N=3,461). The greatest numbers of AIDS cases were reported from two counties located in the southeastern part of the state, Broward (N=631) and Miami-Dade (N=728). These two counties reported a combined total of 1,359 cases in 2010, 39% of the statewide total. Figure 1. AIDS Cases and Rate* by County of Residence , Florida, 2010 County totals exclude Department of Corrections cases (N=46) Florida ranked first among states in the number of Human Immunodeficiency V irus (HIV) cases reported in 2009, which is the most recent year data is available nationally . That year, a total of 5,755 (13% of the U.S. total) HIV cases were reported in Florida, followed by 4,886 (11%) in California and 4,291 (10%) in New York. In 2010, at least one HIV case was reported in all but four counties and eight counties reported 100 or more cases (Figure 2). These eight counties were Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas and Polk. They reported a combined total of 3,889 cases, or 75% of Florida's total reported cases in 2010 (N=5,211). The greatest numbers of HIV cases were reported from Miami-Dade (N=1,242), Broward (N=882), and Orange (N=485). These three counties reported a combined total of 2,609 cases in 2010, or 50% of the statewide total. Figure 1 .

HIV Cases and Rate* by County of Residence, Florida, 2010 County totals exclude Department of Corrections cases (N=79) Reported HIV cases increased in 2002 due to increased HIV testing statewide as part of the \"Get to Know Your Status\" campaign. Since that time, newly reported HIV cases have decreased each year until 2007. Enhanced reporting laws were implemented in November 2006, leading to an artificial peak in HIV cases in 2007 and 2008, followed by an artificial decrease in 2009 with an expected leveling in 2010 (Figure 3).

AIDS Cases, by Year of Report, Florida, 2001-2010 Adult AIDS and HIV Cases by Selected Demographics As in previous years, the greatest proportion of AIDS cases reported in 2010 was among persons aged 40-49 years old (33%) (Figure 5). This year, the 50+ age group was second, with 28% of the reported AIDS cases, followed by the 30-39 age group with 24%. As with AIDS cases, a greater proportion of HIV cases in 2010 were also reported among those aged 40-49 (27%) followed by those aged 20-29 (25%) and aged 30-39 (23%). Adult cases for both AIDS and HIV are defined as those occurring in people 13 years of age and older. The analysis shown below includes only adult cases. Figure 5. Age Distribution of Florida's Adult* AIDS and HIV Cases, 2010 *Adult cases for both HIV and AIDS are defined as those occurring in people 13 years of age and older. AIDS cases tend to represent HIV transmission that occurred many years ago. The relative increase in female cases reflects the changing face of the AIDS epidemic over time. In 2001, 29% of the AIDS cases reported in Florida were female (Figure 6). Over the past ten years, the proportion of AIDS cases among men and women has remained fairly level. The male-to-female ratio declined slightly from 2.4 to 1 in 2001 to 2.1 to 1 in 2010. Figure 4.

The male-to-female ratio declined slightly from 2.4 to 1 in 2001 to 2.1 to 1 in 2010. Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions In 2010, the AIDS case rate per 100,000 population was 30.6 among adult males and 13.5 among adult fe - males, indicating that AIDS cases in this period were still more likely to be reported among males than females in Florida. Figure 6. Percent of Adult* AIDS Cases by Sex and Year of Report, Florida, 2001-2010 *Adult cases for both HIV and AIDS are defined as those occurring in people 13 years of age and older. The trend for HIV cases by sex is the opposite of that for AIDS cases. The relative increase in male HIV cases might be attributed to proportional increases in HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM), which may influence future AIDS trends. In 2001, 35% of the HIV cases reported in Florida were female (Figure 7). Over the past ten years, the proportion of HIV cases among men has increased while the propor - tion among women has decreased. The result is an increase in the male-to-female ratio, from 1.9 to 1 in 2001 to 3.0 to 1 in 2010. This pattern differs from that seen for AIDS cases during the same time period. In 2010, the HIV case rate per 100,000 population was 50.2 among adult males and 16.2 among adult females, higher than the rates seen in AIDS cases. Figure 7. Percent of Adult* HIV Cases by Sex and Year of Report, Florida, 2001-2010 *Adult cases for both HIV and AIDS are defined as those occurring in people 13 years of age and older.In 2010, the AIDS case rate per 100,000 population was 30.6 among adult males and 13.5 among adult females, indicating that AIDS cases in this period were still more likely to be reported among males than females in Florida. Figure 6. Percent of Adult* AIDS Cases by Sex and Year of Report, Florida, 2001-2010 *Adult cases for both HIV and AIDS are defined as those occurring in people 13 years of age and older. The trend for HIV cases by sex is the opposite of that for AIDS cases. The relative increase in male HIV cases might be attributed to proportional increases in HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM), which may influence future AIDS trends. In 2001, 35% of the HIV cases reported in Florida were female (Figure 7). Over the past ten years, the proportion of HIV cases among men has increased while the proportion among women has decreased.

HIV/AIDS Cases by Transmission CategoryAmong the male AIDS and HIV cases reported for 2010, men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk factor (61% and 74% respectively) followed by cases with a heterosexual risk (28% for AIDS and 21% for HIV) (Figure 13). Recently, transmission among MSM has increased as indicated by the higher percent of MSM among HIV cases compared to AIDS cases, as HIV cases tend to represent a more recent picture of the epidemic.

Figure 14. Adult Female AIDS and HIV Cases by Mode of Exposure, Florida, 2010 Perinatal HIV/AIDS Cases Of the 1,167 perinatally infected babies born in Florida from 1979 through 2009 (most complete year), two were born as early as 1979 (Figure 15). Since that time, the birth of HIV -infected babies continued to rise through 1993. In April 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service released guidelines for zidovudine (ZDV) also known as azidothymidine (AZT), used to reduce perinatal HIV transmission, and in 1995 recommendations for HIV counseling and voluntary testing for pregnant women were published. The mandatory of fering of HIV test- ing to pregnant women became law in Florida in October 1996. Since then, the percent of perinatally infected children who received ZDV or whose mothers received ZDV has increased markedly . Through enhanced perinatal surveillance systems, it has been documented that ZDV use among exposed infants and mothers of HIV-infected children has increased at the prenatal, intrapartum, delivery and neonatal stages. Prevention of perinatal HIV remains a very high priority in Florida. In the past few years, the use of other medical therapies, including protease inhibitors, has supplemented the use of ZDV for both infected mothers and their babies. The use of these medical therapies has been accompanied by a decrease in the number of perinatally HIV-infected infants and is responsible for the dramatic decline in perinatally acquired HIV/AIDS since 1994. Furthermore, numerous initiatives have contributed to the reduction in these cases. Major initia - tives include: seven Targeted Outreach to Pregnant Women Act (TOPWA) programs, three perinatal nurses located in the most heavily impacted counties, social marketing, and provider education. These initiatives have helped to further educate local providers in the importance of testing pregnant women for HIV and then of fering effective treatment during the pregnancy and at delivery to further decrease the chances of vertical transmis - sion. As a result, significant decreases in annual perinatal HIV-infected births have been observed in Florida since 1997, with a leveling trend from 2002 through 2007 followed by another sharp decrease in 2008 and 2009. In summary, these successful initiatives have resulted in a 94% decline in HIV-perinatally infected births in Florida from 1993 (N=110) to 2009 (N=8). Figure 15.

Perinatal HIV/AIDS Cases by Year of Birth, Born in Florida, 1979-2009 (N=1,167) Prevalence Estimate of HIV Infection in the U.S. and Florida Assessment of the extent of the HIV epidemic is an important step in community planning for HIV prevention and HIV/AIDS patient care. The HIV prevalence estimate, the estimated number of persons living with HIV infection, includes those living with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS and those who may be infected but are unaware of their serostatus. Approximately 1,039,000-1,185,000 persons are currently living with HIV infection in the U.S. Florida has consistently reported 10-12% of the national AIDS morbidity and currently accounts for 11% of all persons living with AIDS in the U.S. (Table 1). The Department of Health now estimates that approxi - mately 135,000 persons, or roughly 11.7% of the national total, are currently living with HIV infection in Florida as of the end of 2009. As compared to national data, Florida has a slightly higher proportion of women infected with HIV (30%) compared to the U.S. (27%). Florida has similar patterns of HIV -infected cases among blacks (49%) compared to the U.S. (48%) and among MSM (44% vs. 46%). However, Florida has a far higher proportion of HIV-infected cases among heterosexuals (39% vs. 28%) and a much lower proportion among injection drug users (IDU) (11% vs. 19%) compared to the U.S. Figure 16.

They include: Know your HIV status. Everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should be tested for HIV at least once. If you are at increased risk for HIV, you should be tested for HIV at least once a year. o If you have HIV , you can get medical care, treatment, and supportive services to help you stay healthy and reduce your ability to transmit the virus to others. o If you are pregnant and find that you have HIV , treatments are available to reduce the chance that your baby will have HIV. Abstain from sexual activity or be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner. Limit your number of sex partners. The fewer partners you have, the less likely you are to encounter someone who is infected with HIV or another STD. Correct and consistent condom use. Latex condoms are highly ef fective at preventing transmission of HIV and some other sexually transmitted diseases. \"Natural\" or lambskin condoms do not provide sufficient protection against HIV infection. Get tested and treated for STDs and insist that your partners do too. Male circumcision has also been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from women to men during vaginal sex. Do not inject drugs. If you inject drugs, you should get counseling and treatment to stop or reduce your drug use. If you cannot stop injecting drugs, use clean needles and works when injecting. Obtain medical treatment immediately if you think you were exposed to HIV . Sometimes, HIV medica - tions can prevent infection if they are started quickly. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. Participate in risk reduction programs. Programs exist to help people make healthy decisions, such as negotiating condom use or discussing HIV status. Figure 17.

Florida's comprehensive HIV prevention program provides high-quality culturally appropriate prevention and education services to Florida's at-risk and HIV-infected populations. The program's overarching goals include U.S. Florida Total Cases 663,084 and Conditions Florida's comprehensive HIV prevention program provides high-quality culturally appropriate prevention and education services to Florida's at-risk and HIV-infected populations. The program's overarching goals include reducing the number of new HIV infections, increasing the proportion of HIV -infected persons who know their status, linking HIV-infected persons to care and support services, and reducing risky behaviors that might lead to HIV/STD infection. Our comprehensive program has multiple components, each designed around evidence-based models that are targeted, monitored, and evaluated to ensure maximum effectiveness. The HIV prevention community plan - ning process provides a voice for persons affected by and infected with HIV. The process is designed to allow information to flow from the top down and from the bottom up and to ensure that all of our prevention activities are aligned with our comprehensive prevention plan.

There were twelve cases of arsenic poisoning reported during 2010. Counties that reported cases are Bay (1), Broward (2), Brevard (1), Charlotte (1), Marion (1), Martin (1), Pasco (1), Pinellas (2), Polk (1), and St. Lucie (1). Cases were predomi - nantly in males (8 of 12). Cases ranged from 33 to 79 years of age. The mean and median age of cases was 59.3 and 58.5 respectively. Among the twelve reported cases, eight were among whites and three non-whites, and one was of unknown race. Only six cases had ethnicity information recorded, of which two were reported as Hispanic. Most arsenic-induced toxicity in humans is due to exposure to inorganic arsenic. Organic arsenic found in fish is not believed to be toxic. Total arsenic tests do not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic (the more toxic form). For this reason, positive total arsenic laboratory test results from specimens taken within 72 hours of consumption of seafood do not meet the laboratory criteria for diagnosis. Common sources of potential inorganic arsenic exposure in Florida are chromated copper arsenate (CCA)- treated wood, tobacco smoke, certain agricultural pesticides, and some homeopathic and naturopathic prepa - rations, and folk remedies. In addition, arsenic is a naturally occurring contaminant found in water in certain areas of Florida, affecting (unregulated) private drinking wells in particular. Nine cases had unintentional exposure, one was intentional, and two were of unknown intent. The source of arsenic exposure was unknown for two cases (16.67%). The sources reported for the remaining cases were exposure to agricultural pesticides (3), vitamin supplements (2), CCA-treated wood (1), well water (1), cigarette smoke (1), spray paint (1), and work in the mining industry (1). Among the 12 cases only two were hospitalized. Analysis of Varied Data Sources for Arsenic Poisoning Events 2005 - 2009 In order to better estimate the burden of arsenic related poisonings, de-identified hospitalization and emer - gency department (ED) visit data from the Agency for Healthcare Administration, and mortality data from the Office of Vital Statistics were searched for arsenic-related poisonings using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Selected codes were E985.1, E950.8, E980.8, E866.3 for ED visits and T57.0 for deaths. The data was extracted for one or more ICD codes present in the primary or secondary diagnosis fields from years 2005 through 2009 (the most recent year for which data was available). There were a total of 35 ED visits and 18 hospitalizations from 2005 through 2009 where information about arsenic poisoning was present in the record (Figure 1).

Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalizations for Arsenic Poisoning by Gender, Florida, 2005 to 2009 Prevention The Florida Department of Health performs surveillance for arsenic poisoning and provides education regard - ing exposure prevention. According to Florida statute, public water supplies must be tested for arsenic. Florida drinking water standards for arsenic set the minimum concentration level (MCL) at 10 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L). Drinking water from private wells, particularly in areas with known high arsenic concentrations in ground or well water , should be tested by the homeowner specifically for arsenic. Prevention tips for arsenic exposure: If your drinking water source is a private well, and you suspect higher arsenic concentrations, have your well water tested. Use bottled water for drinking until the well is shown to be safe or until appropriate water filtration systems are put in place to remove the arsenic. Stop smoking. Cigarettes contain arsenic. Ensure a well balanced diet rich in selenium, other antioxidants, and folate. When using chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated lumber , follow the warnings regarding the wearing of personal protective equipment such as gloves, eye, and respiratory protection. Have children wash their hands after playing on CCA-treated lumber play equipment. Consider annual application of a sealant on any existing CCA-treated lumber surfaces. Limit sun exposure and use sunscreen to help decrease the risk of skin cancer . Exposure to arsenic and UVB radiation together may further increase the risk of developing skin cancer . Discuss your concerns regarding arsenic and prevention of hazardous exposures at the workplace with your employer and/or workplace health and safety representative. If you think arsenic is making you sick, contact your physician to seek medical assistance and contact your county health department to report arsenic poisoning.

Nine cases were reported in 2010, eight confirmed and one probable. The person meeting the probable case definition had illness onset and exposure in 2009 but was not reported until 2010. The individual was epidemiologically linked to a family member whose blood culture tested positive for Brucella suis . In addition to the 82 reported cases in Florida, there were investigations associated with non-Florida residents: a B. abortus infected patient from Nicaragua identified while visiting Miami-Dade County, an Alabama resident diagnosed with B. suis in Escambia County, as well as a Michigan resident and a Maine resident each diagnosed with brucellosis in their states of resi - dence after hunting feral hogs in Monroe and Brevard counties respectively . Speciation was available for eight of nine cases. Six B. suis and two B. melitensis isolates were identified. Location of exposure was determined to be in Florida for all except for one child infected with B. melitensis whose illness was associated with travel to visit family in Syria. A second person with B. melitensis was sus- pected to have sexually acquired the infection from their spouse. The spouse's infection was likely acquired during travel to Greece, where B. melitensis is endemic. He visited a rural village and reportedly had febrile symptoms since returning to the U.S., but refused to be tested. Risk factors for the other infected people included eating unpasteurized milk products (imported B. melitensis), hunting feral hogs in Florida (six B. suis cases), or handling uncooked meat from feral hogs (one B. suis case). For three cases, time from onset to diagnosis was greater than six months. Cases occurred throughout the year , as might be expected with a disease with extended incubation periods and a capacity to cause chronic illness (Figure 2). Men accounted for all six infections associated with hunting feral hogs (67%); both B. melitensis cases were in females, as was the case associated with handling raw meat from feral hogs. Six cases were in whites (67%), two in blacks (22%), and one was listed as of other race (11%). All cases were in non-Hispanic persons. Affected people ranged in age from 3 to 65 years. Incidence was highest in those aged 25 to 34 years, representing three of the nine cases (Figure 3). Fifty-eight private laboratory workers or orthopedic surgery personnel in 1 1 Florida hospitals or laboratories were exposed to Brucella in 2010, including 55 high-risk and three low-risk exposures. Of the 1 1 cases with Brucella positive cultures in 2010 (including cases in non-residents mentioned above), eight resulted in at least one laboratory or orthopedic surgery exposure. Rapid communication of suspect culture results to a laboratory by the Sarasota County Health Department likely prevented exposures to personnel in one laboratory . Two of the exposed persons were pregnant; one miscarried but this did not appear to be linked to the Brucella exposure. Reasons for laboratory exposures include: Brucella was not suspected as the cause of illness (five Brucellosis Brucellosis: Crude Data Number of Cases 9 2010 incidence rate per 100,000 0.05 % change from average 5 year (2005- 2009) reported cases 21.6% Age (yrs) Mean 40.9 Median 35 Min-Max 3 - 65 Disease Abstract From 2001 through 2010, 82 cases of human brucellosis were reported in Florida.

Brucellosis Cases by Age Group, Florida, 2010 62Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Prevention Prevention can best be accomplished through education of hunters, animal workers, and those handling raw meat from feral swine on proper use of personal protective equipment. Prevention measures include the following strategies: W ear gloves and other protective clothing. W ork in properly ventilated areas. Dispose of animal carcasses and tissues properly . Disinfect contaminated areas. Handle modified live vaccines properly . Educate travelers and the general public about the risks of drinking or eating unpasteurized dairy products, especially products originating in countries where brucellosis is endemic in livestock. Outreach is recommended for laboratory personnel and orthopedic surgeons to ensure knowledge of ap - propriate personal protective equipment for specimen handling and surgical procedures (aerosol protection), and clinicians should be reminded to forewarn laboratories working with patient culture samples if Brucella is included in the differential diagnosis or if they receive positive serologic results. Laboratories should be periodically reminded of state and federal confirmation and reporting requirements for this select agent. Continued surveillance and management programs for Brucella spp. in domestic livestock will reduce exposure risk from domestic animals in Florida. Surveillance is also important because Brucella has the potential for use as a bioterrorism agent.

In 2010, there was a 17.7% increase in comparison to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. A total of 1,211 cases were reported in 2010, of which 95.5% were classified as confirmed. The number of cases reported tends to increase in the summer months. In 2010, the number of cases reported exceeded the previous five-year averages for the same time period in all months except May (Figure 2). The highest incidence occurs among infants under one year old and children aged one to four years (Figure 3). Overall, 7.4% of the campylobacteriosis cases reported in 2010 were classified as outbreak-associated, as compared to 7.1% in 2009. The majority (85.7%) of cases were acquired within Florida, though 10.2% were acquired outside of the U.S. Figure 2.

Reported Cases of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning by Age Group, Florida, 2010 Reported cases were primarily white (N=137, 68.2%), followed by blacks 5.5%). Thirty-three cases (16.4%) were reported as Hispanic. Among all cases, the majority of CO poisoning cases were unintentional (86.1%, N=173). Only 22 cases (10.9%) were recorded as intentional poisonings. A cluster is defined as any two or more related cases of CO exposure. Approximately 71.6% (N=144) of the cases were associated with 54 clusters of exposure. More than 773 people were involved in these 54 clusters; but after review, only 144 matched the case definition and were considered reportable. The most common relationship among people involved in CO clusters was family and friends (N=1 15, 79.9%), followed by neigh - bors and coworkers (N=21, 14.6%). The relationship between cases was unknown for eight cases (5.6%). Most of the exposures occurred in residential areas (N=158, 78.6%) followed by the (N=5, 2.5%). Other locations reported include an auto-shop, vehicle, tent, and parking lot. Exposure site was unknown for three cases. About 8% (N=16) of the cases were work-related and half of them (N=8) involved food handlers. One work-related case reported being a health care worker. The majority of cases were a result of exposures to exhaust from an automobile (N=74, 36.8 %), portable fuel burning grill/stove (N=29, 14.4%) or fuel burning appliances (N=25,12.4%) (Figure 3). About 75% of the automobile related CO poisoning cases occurred during May, June, July, August, and December. The cases that occurred in Florida's cold weather months were primarily due to inappropriate use of devices for heating. In January, cases were predominantly related to portable fuel burning grills or stoves (N=26), as well as fuel burning appliances (N=13). Similarly, 19.4% of the cases in December were related to space heaters (N=7). This demonstrates that during cold winter months, Floridians used improper heating methods or did not use equipment properly. Past studies show that generator-related CO poisonings increased during hurricane season in Florida. The number of generator-related CO poisoning cases (N= 15) was low in 2010 which correlates to the absence of hurricane land-falls in Florida. Figure 2.

Thirty three cases (16.4%) were reported as Hispanic. Among all cases, the majority of CO poisoning cases were unintentional (86.1%, N=173). Only 22 cases (10.9%) were recorded as intentional poisonings. A cluster is defined as any two or more related cases of CO exposure. Approximately 71.6% (N=144) of the cases were associated with 54 clusters of exposure. More than 773 people were involved in these 54 clusters; but after review, only 144 matched the case definition and were considered reportable. The most common relationship among people involved in CO clusters was family and friends (N=115, 79.9%), followed by neighbors and coworkers (N=21, 14.6%). The relationship between cases was unknown for eight cases (5.6%). Most of the exposures occurred in residential areas (N=158, 78.6%) followed by the 2.5%).

Trends show that since the disease became reportable, it is now the most common reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in Florida and the nation. The prevalence of chlamydia is highest among those under 25 years of age and in specific populations such as women and minorities. Chlamydia infection can be asymptomatic. Because of this, annual testing for chlamydia is recommended for all sexually active adolescents and young women up to age 25. Chlamydial infections are geographically widespread and continue to increase each year. In Florida, chlamydia accounts for 75% of all reportable STDs. The 2010 case rate of 397.8 per 100,000 population is the highest of the past five years. In 2010, 74,745 chlamydia cases were reported. Figure 1. Reported Cases of Chlamydia by Year, Florida, 2006-2010 The most prominent risk factor for chlamydial infection is age. Persons between the ages of 15-24 years represent only 13% of Florida's population in 2010 yet account for 71% (53,012) of all reported chlamydia cases in Florida. Also, 29% (215 of 746) of youth and young adults with a known HIV positive status had a new chlamydia infection in 2010. Table 1.

Also, 29% (215 of 746) of youth and young adults with a known HIV positive status had a new chlamydia infection in 2010. Table 1. Reported Chlamydia Case Count and Rate per 100,000 Population, by Selected Age Groups, Florida, 2010 The vast differences in the distribution of chlamydia infections by age are caused by higher biological susceptibility to STD infections, prevalence of risky sexual behaviors, and a combination of other factors, which leave adolescents and young adults disproportionately affected with chlamydia compared to older populations. Therefore, greater prevention and education emphasis has been placed on adolescents and young adults. Older people are also susceptible to contracting an STD due to perceived decreased susceptibility coupled with an actual increase in risk due to less effective immune systems and biological vulnerability after menopause. People in older age groups are also less likely to be screened for these diseases and therefore might pass on the disease to more people before becoming aware of their disease status. From 2006 to 2010, chlamydia cases among individuals over the age of 55 have increased by 84.5%. The number of cases reported between 2006-2010 (N=1,153) in people 55 and over is much less than for the 15-24 age group, but as people age the immune system becomes less effective, putting older adults at high risk for STDs that may Age Group Cases Reported Cases of Chlamydia by Year, Florida, 2006-2010 Figure 1.

As people age the immune system becomes less effective, putting older adults at high risk for STDs that may cause other health problems. More than 60% of people 55 years and older are sexually active at least once a month, and yet, they are rarely considered to be at risk for an STD. People who are no longer sexually active may still have chronic infection with an STD for which they were never treated or screened, which could be mistaken for other diseases of aging. In 2010, women accounted for more than 70% of reported chlamydia cases. National trends indicate chla - mydia infections are most often detected in women under the age of 25. Florida statistics mimic this trend; women under the age of 25 account for half of reported morbidity . In 2010 and previous years, the highest number of cases in women were reported in those between the ages of 15 to 24 years (Figure 2). The highest rate among women was in the 20 to 24 year age group (3,432.2 per 100,000) and the rate for women in the 15 to 19 year age group was slightly lower at 3,347.9 per 100,000 population. The high rates of chlamydia seen in women may be due in part to improved recognition of the disease because of more frequent screenings for chlamydia in women than in men. Chlamydia rates in men were lower overall than in women, but similar age distributions are seen in both genders. Adolescents and young adults account for the majority of reported cases by age (men 61%, women 75%). Among men, those aged 20 to 24 years had the highest rate (1,334.4 per 100,000), followed by men between the ages of 15 to 19 years with a rate of 797.8 per 100,000 population. Men between the ages of 25 to 29 years accounted for 20% of chlamydia cases reported among men, whereas women in the same age cohort accounted for 15% of chlamydia cases. 73Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Figure 2. Reported Cases of Chlamydia by Selected Age Groups, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity, Florida, 2010 Non-Hispanic blacks account for 50% of all reported chlamydia cases in 2010, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 24.3%, Hispanics accounted for 13.5%, and people who self reported as other or unidentified accounted for 12.1% of cases. Compared to non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, non-Hispanic black female adolescents had the highest rates of chlamydia in Florida. The case rate (6,948.4 per 100,000) for non-Hispanic black women 15 to 24 years old was four times as high as the second highest rate (1,723.4 per 100,000) in non-Hispanic white females 15 to 24 years old. Cases of chlamydia have increased in both non-Hispanic blacks (15.2%) and non-Hispanic whites (31.4%) from 2009 to 2010, whereas cases with unidentified race or ethnicity data decreased by 54.8%. These changes were likely due to improved reporting practices rather than an actual change in demographics of cases. Prevention According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the surest way to avoid transmission of any STD is to abstain from sexual contact, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. CDC recommends yearly chlamydia testing of all sexually active women age 25 or younger, older women with risk factors for chlamydial infections, such as those who have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners, and all pregnant women. When used consistently and correctly, a latex condom can reduce the risk of transmission of chlamydia. If there are any genital symp - toms such as an unusual sore, discharge with odor, burning during urination, or bleeding between menstrual cycles could mean a chlamydia infection is present. If a woman or man has any of these symptoms, they should stop having sex and consult a health care provider immediately . Treating chlamydia early in women can prevent pelvic inflammatory disease. Women and men who are told they have a chlamydial infection and are treated for it should notify all of their recent sex partners (sex partners within the preceding 60 days) so they can see a health care provider and be evaluated for any possible STD exposure. Sexual activity should not resume until all sex partners have been examined and, if necessary , treated.

Reported Cases of Chlamydia by Selected Age Groups, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity, Florida, 2010 74Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Cholera Disease Abstract In 2010, four laboratory-confirmed cases of cholera were reported, for a statewide incidence rate of 0.02 cases per 100,000 population. A confirmed case of cholera is defined as a clinically compatible illness in a person from whom toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139 has been isolated from stool or vomitus, or who has serologic evidence of recent infection. V. cholerae O1 serotype Ogawa was isolated from stool specimens of all four patients. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked these cases to the outbreak of cholera in Haiti that was confirmed on October 21, 2010. All cases in Florida were associated with recent travel from Haiti. Approximately 45% of all Haitian immigrants to the U.S. reside in Florida. One patient was a resident of Haiti relocating to Florida and three patients traveled to Haiti to visit family and friends. Two patients reported exposure to lake water and one of these also drank water and bathed at a community well. Dates of illness onset ranged from October 23 to November 29, 2010. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 84 years; all were female. Symptoms included diarrhea, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, and vomiting. All patients were treated with antibiotics and intravenous rehydration. Three of four patients were hospitalized; none died. In 2010, cases were reported in Broward (2), Collier (1), and Orange (1) counties. No local transmission was identified among household contacts in Florida. Please see the \"Cholera\" section in the Summary of Notable Outbreaks and Case Investigations, 2010 for additional descriptions of two of the 2010 cases. Additional information can be accessed through the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report article listed in the Additional Resources section. Prevention Travelers to cholera-affected countries can reduce the risk of cholera by following the five prevention mes - sages listed below. Drink and use safe water . W ash your hands often with soap and safe water. Use latrines or bury your feces; do not defecate in any body of water . Cook food well (especially seafood), keep it covered, eat it hot, and peel fruits and vegetables. Clean up safely\u2014in the kitchen and in places where the family bathes and washes clothes. Cholera vaccines are not currently available in the United States and CDC does not recommend cholera vaccines for most travelers.

This may be due to lack of recognition among the medical community, the non-fatal nature of the disease, and the short duration. Case-finding in Florida is thought to be more complete, although it is likely that there is significant under-reporting. In 2010, a total of 20 CFP cases (annual rate = 0.1 per 100,000) were reported, which was a decrease in cases compared to 2009 when 49 cases (rate = 0.26) were reported and 2008 when 53 cases (rate=0.3) were reported. Seventy percent (14) of cases were male and 30% (6) were female. Additionally , 70% (14) were of a white Hispanic race/ethnicity and 30% (6) were of a white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity . The counties where cases were reported included: Miami-Dade (15), Leon (3), Brevard (1), and Broward (1). The three cases from Leon County were a part of a single outbreak associated with a local restaurant where the af fected people consumed escolar. In Miami-Dade, multiple CFP outbreaks were reported, which included two cases in people who consumed a 60-pound grouper caught near Salt Cay, three who consumed a barracuda caught near Marathon Key, and four who consumed a 12-pound barracuda. The remaining cases were not associated with an outbreak. The implicated fish associated with all single and outbreak-associated CFP cases in 2010 included barracuda (12), escolar (3), grouper (3), snapper (1), and multiple fish (grouper and snapper) (1). All 20 cases were acquired in Florida, although the implicated fish originated from many dif ferent locations. Note: The number of outbreak-related cases summarized in the Bureau of Environmental Public Health Medicine summaries may not match Merlin case report numbers. This is due to the fact that outbreaks often include ill people who are not residents of the State of Florida (i.e., visitors who were exposed and got sick while in Florida), or people whose illnesses did not meet the surveillance case definition and were therefore not posted in Merlin. Also, outbreak cases may not match with Merlin across counties (often people cross county boundaries to eat in other counties). Outbreaks are generally reported by county and state of exposure; individual reportable diseases are reported by county and state of residence. References David L.

Seventy percent (14) of cases were male and 30% (6) were female. Additionally, 70% (14) were of a white Hispanic race/ethnicity and 30% (6) were of a white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity. The counties where cases were reported included: Miami-Dade (15), Leon (3), Brevard (1), and Broward (1). The three cases from Leon County were a part of a single outbreak associated with a local restaurant where the affected people consumed escolar. In Miami-Dade, multiple CFP outbreaks were reported which included two cases in people who consumed a 60-pound grouper caught near Salt Cay, three who consumed a barracuda caught near Marathon Key, and four who consumed a 12-pound barracuda. The remaining cases were not outbreak associated.

All 20 cases were acquired in Florida, although the implicated fish originated from many different locations. Note: the number of outbreak-related cases summarized in the Bureau of Environmental Public Health Medicine summaries may not match Merlin case report numbers. This is due to the fact that outbreaks often include ill people who are not residents of the State of Florida (i.e., visitors who were exposed and got sick while in Florida), or people whose illnesses did not meet the surveillance case definition and were therefore not posted in Merlin. Also, outbreak cases may not match with Merlin across counties (often people cross county boundaries to eat in other counties). Outbreaks are generally reported by county/state of exposure; individual reportable diseases are generally reported by county/state of residence. 012345678910 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec MonthNumber of Cases Previous 5 year average 2010Figure 2.

Ciguatera Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 77Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Cryptosporidiosis Disease Abstract Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the organism Cryptosporidium parvum . A total of 408 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in 2010, of which 94.6% were classified as confirmed. Just over 7% of all reported cases were classified as outbreak-related, which is a decrease from 10% the previous year; 6.1% of cases were acquired outside the U.S. The incidence rate for cryptosporidiosis increased sharply from 2004 to 2006 (Figure 1), was stable through 2007, and since has fallen somewhat to a level well above that before 2005. Increases in cryptosporidiosis are commonly observed during the summer months when exposure to recreational water is more common. In 2010, the number of cases occurring each month during the summer was lower than the five-year average for July through October (Figure 2). The overall increase in cryptosporidiosis over the past decade is consistent with national trends, but whether the increase is due to increased reporting and diagnostic practices or an increase in disease burden is unclear . What is clear is that outbreak-related case reporting has influenced yearly rates although it does not explain the entire increase. The introduction of nitazoxanide in 2004, the first licensed treatment for the disease, may have influenced clinical practice because diagnostic testing for Cryptosporidium now can lead to specific treatment.

In 2010, approximately 37% of reported cases were in children aged < five years who attended daycare centers. The smaller second peak in incidence among adults aged 20 to 44 years may be attributable to family contact with infected children (Figure 3). Cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in 49 of the 67 counties in Florida (Figure 4). Gilchrist County , with the highest incidence, reported no cases as outbreak-associated.

Cryptosporidiosis Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida 2010 Prevention The likelihood of contracting cryptosporidiosis can be reduced by practicing good hand hygiene, such as wash - ing hands before handling or eating food and after diaper changing. W ater in recreational settings, such as swimming pools or water parks, should not be ingested or swallowed. Outbreaks associated with recreational water, especially water parks and interactive fountains, can be prevented if managers of those sites follow established guidelines for management of these facilities. Many of the guidelines are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Health Swimming/Recreational Water Program at http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/. A swimmer's likelihood of contracting or spreading cryptosporidiosis in a recreational water setting can be reduced by practicing the following healthy swimming behaviors. A void swallowing pool water or even getting it in your mouth. Shower before swimming and wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. When swimming, take children on bathroom breaks or check diapers often. Change diapers in a bathroom and not at poolside and thoroughly clean the diaper changing area. Protect others by not swimming if you are experiencing diarrhea (this is essential for children in diapers) and for at least two weeks after diarrhea stops.Cryptosporidiosis Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida 2010 Prevention The likelihood of contracting cryptosporidiosis can be reduced by practicing good hand hygiene, such as washing hands before handling or eating food and after diaper changing.

With the exception of a large outbreak of cyclosporiasis in 2005 (493 cases from Florida; see the notable outbreaks sec - tion of the Florida Morbidity Statistics Report 1997-2006 for more details), the incidence rate for cyclosporiasis has remained stable in recent years (Figure 1). In comparison to the median incidence for the last five years, the incidence in 2010 increased by 57.6%, with a total of 63 cases reported compared to 40 cases in 2009. Only 9.5% of the cases reported in 2010 were considered outbreak-associated. In 2010, the number of cases by month of disease onset met or exceeded the previous five-year median during all months of the year when cases were reported, except for April, July, August, and November (Figure 2). Of the cases reported with onset dates in June, only four were listed as outbreak associated. Two were a household cluster with no identified risk factors. The other two were also household contacts who also had recent travel history to Mexico. All other cases were listed as sporadic, only 11% of those cases were listed as being acquired outside of the U.S. The peak in late spring and early summer may reflect the seasonal variation of endemic cyclosporiasis in countries that export fruits and vegetables to the U.S. Figure 2.

It is also the most common mosquito-borne viral infection in the world. Since 1998, imported dengue cases have been reported in Florida each year . The number of cases reported typically ranged from 10 to 20 per year until 2007, when 46 cases were reported (Figure 1). After 2007, the case counts have remained elevated, with 33 cases reported in 2008, 55 in 2009, and 195 cases reported in 2010. Of those cases reported in 2010, three were categorized as dengue hemorrnagic fever , which is a more severe presentation of DENV infection. This increase is due in part to illness acquired in Florida (primarily Key West), and due to greater prevalence of dengue worldwide and epidemics in areas with high volume of travelers to the U.S., such as Puerto Rico. Increased activity is especially of concern because of the potential for introduction to Florida mosquitoes via infected symptomatic or asymptomatic travelers, which could lead to the virus' re-establishment in the state. Competent mosquito vectors are present in all parts of the state, though the Aedes aegypti species that predominates in the southernmost parts of the state is a more efficient vector than the Aedes albopictus species more common elsewhere. The establishment of endemic foci in Florida is hampered due in part to the high proportion of residents who have screens and air conditioning in their homes, schools, and workplaces. Unfortunately, the potential for re-emergence was demonstrated in 2009 when an outbreak of dengue fever oc - curred in Key West, Monroe County. Illness was first identified in a New York resident who traveled to the area and became ill upon her return home. Once she was diagnosed with dengue fever and reported, a medical advisory was issued for Key West and active surveillance was implemented. Twenty-two cases meeting the confirmed or probable case definitions were identified; 21 were Florida residents and are included in Figure 1. Onset dates of these cases ranged from early July to mid-October 2009. More information about this outbreak can be found in the Summary of Notable Outbreaks and Case Investigations Section of the 2009 report. There were 64 additional cases with exposure in Monroe County in 2010. Typically, disease onset for travelers returning to Florida peaks during mid-summer and fall, though cases are reported year-round (Figure 2). The unusual increase in August through October 2009 is primarily due to the Key West outbreak. There were a large number of cases with onset in January 2010 as well as in 2009, which may have been due to holiday travel.00.20.40.60.811.2 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 YearCases per 100,000Figure 1.

Dengue Fever Cases by Month of Onset, Florida, 2010 Figure 3. Dengue Fever Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 In 2010, 66 cases of locally-acquired dengue were reported as acquired in Broward (1), Miami-Dade (1) and Monroe (64) counties. There were two additional cases that had illness onset in 2010 but were not reported until 2011, both of which were acquired in Monroe County bringing the total number of cases acquired there to 66 in 2010. Of the cases acquired in Monroe County in 2010 (66), there were 55 Key W est residents, one from Monroe County (not a Key West resident), eight cases were residents of other Florida counties, and two were from other states (and were reported by their respective states). Onset dates ranged from March 17 to November 30, 2010. The mean age of reported dengue cases acquired in Florida is 53 years (range: 22-86). Ninety-two percent of cases were white and 61% were male. In 2010, 131 cases of imported dengue were reported. Of those, two had onset dates in 2009. In addition to the 131 imported dengue cases for 2010, five cases had onset dates in 2010 but were not reported until 201 1. Therefore, the total number of cases reported as being imported with onset dates in 2010 was 134 cases.

T ravelers to dengue-endemic countries should be warned of the risk of disease and instructed to avoid mosquito bites. People should take the following precautions to protect themselves from mosquitoes. DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying: Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected. Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used. Empty and clean birdbaths and pet' s water bowls at least once or twice a week. Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water . Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.Caribbean countries 27%, Central America 21%, South America 20% and Asian and African countries 5% combined.

Dengue Fever Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida, 2010 86Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions COVER skin with clothing or repellent: CLOTHING - W ear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present. REPELLENT - Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET , picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective. Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old. COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house: Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

EEEV occurs in natural cycles involving birds and Culiseta melanura mosquitoes in freshwater swampy areas. Peak activity occurs between May and August, but transmission can occur year-round. In the usual cycle of transmission (enzootic cycle), EEEV remains in the swampy areas, as the mosquito involved prefers to feed upon birds and does not usually bite humans or other mammals. Most human cases are thought to occur when the virus occasionally moves into other mosquito species that are more likely to bite people and act as bridge vectors. Horses are more likely to live in swampy environments than humans; therefore, infections in unvaccinated horses can sometimes be used as indicators for focal EEEV activity . All evidence indicates that human eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) does not have epidemic potential in Florida, but it can cause severe disease in those infected. Continuous surveillance since 1957 has docu - mented 82 human cases (average 1.5 cases per year, range: 0-5), including four in 2010. In 2010, EEEV antibodies were also detected in a fatality deemed to be due to other unrelated causes and in an elderly patient with no previously reported encephalitic illness. In the past, EEEV antibodies have only been detected in two other asymptomatic Florida residents, one of which reportedly had survived a previous EEE infection (history not available for the other individual). The cases reported each year from 1999 to 2010 suggest that EEE remains infrequent (Figure 1). In 2010, one case was reported in June and three in July. The majority of EEE cases involve those aged <15 years. However, in 2010, one case involved a one year old child and the other three cases were aged 50-58 years. Of the 17 cases reported between 2001 and 2010, eight (47%) resulted in death. All four cases in 2010 were fatal. This is a higher mortality rate than the rate typically reported in the U.S. (33%). Two cases were female and two male. Three of the cases were white and one was black; all were non-Hispanic. All four cases reportedly either did not use or rarely used mosquito repellants and two regularly smoked outside. T wo of the adults also had underlying disease conditions. Between 2001 and 2010, 10 cases (59%) were reported in individuals residing in counties in the panhandle or northern region of the state, and six cases (35%) were reported from the central region. In 2010, there were two cases from Hillsborough County and one each in Wakulla and Leon counties.Eastern Equine Encephalitis Figure 1.

Prevention 88Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Prevention Prevention of the disease is a necessity, as there is no cure for EEE; only supportive care is available. Measures should be taken to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes including: using EP A-approved insect repellents that contain DEET, Picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus; avoiding spending time outdoors during dusk and dawn or other times when disease-carrying mosquitoes are active; and covering skin with long sleeves and long pants to protect skin from mosquito bites. In addition, screens on doors and windows should be well maintained to ensure mosquitoes cannot enter the home. Draining areas of standing water from around the home to eliminate mosquito breeding sites is also recommended. Horses are quite susceptible to this virus and vaccination is strongly recommended.

Ehrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis Disease AbstractEhrlichia ehrlichiosis (HME). Ehrlichia ewingii has been documented in Florida and is indistinguishable from E. chaffeensis using serologic testing; therefore, some cases classified as HME may actually be due to E. ewingii . The principal vector for both agents is the Lone Star tick, Amblyomma americanum . Due to testing limitations, E. ewingii is not as well characterized as E. chaffeensis; however, it has most frequently been identified in immunocompromised patients. Ehrlichia cases are reported most frequently in the Midwestern and middle-Atlantic states. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) was originally thought to be caused by another species of Ehrlichia , but was later reclassi - fied as Anaplasma with the associated illness renamed human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). The principal vector for A. phagocytophilum is Ixodes scapularis and most cases are reported from the Northeast and Midwestern U.S. HGA became nationally notifiable in 1999.Prevention of the disease is a necessity, as there is no cure for EEE; only supportive care is available.

In 2010, ten cases of HME, three cases of HGA, and one case due to an undetermined species were reported. White-tailed deer is an important reservoir species for E. chaffeensis. Less is known regarding other potential wildlife reservoirs. In addition, there is no standardized tick disease surveillance program in Florida. These gaps in knowledge make it difficult to ascertain why case numbers might fluctuate from year to year . Since HGA was recognized as a separate reportable disease in 1999, there have been consistently more cases of HME than HGA reported in Florida. In 2010, HME cases were 50% male and 50% female, 67% of HGA cases were female, and the single undetermined case was reported as male. The average age of HGA cases was 36 years, which is younger than historic trends. The average age of HME cases was 56 years with a median age of 59, which was slightly older than historic trends. One HME case in a man aged 36 years was fatal. Nine cases (90%) of HME were non-Hispanic whites; the remaining case was of Hispanic ethnicity . Two of the HGA cases were white with one being Hispanic and the other non-Hispanic ethnicity; the race and ethnicity of the third case were unknown. The case due to an undetermined species was white and non-Hispanic. Eighty percent of HME cases were reported as being acquired in Florida, and 20% were acquired in other states in the U.S. Most cases were reported in the north and central parts of the state; three of 10 HME cases were reported from Alachua County. HGA is more likely to be acquired outside Florida; however, all three cases reported in 2010 were acquired in Florida. Though cases of both HME and HGA are reported year-round, peak transmission occurs during the late spring and early summer months (Figure 2). Figure 2. Ehrlichiosis Cases by Month of Onset, Florida, 2010 Prevention Both HME and HGA can be treated with doxycycline, though prevention of tick bites is the best way to avoid disease. Prevention measures include the following strategies. W ear light-colored clothing so that ticks crawling on clothing are visible. T uck pants legs into socks so that ticks cannot crawl inside clothing. Apply repellent to discourage tick attachment. Repellents containing permethrin can be sprayed on boots and clothing, and will last for several days. Repellents containing DEET can be applied to the skin, but will last only a few hours before reapplication is necessary . Search the body for ticks frequently when spending time in potentially tick-infested areas. If a tick is found, it should be removed as soon as possible.

Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: Rocky Mountain coli, Shiga Toxin-Producing Description The commonly identified serogroup of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in the U.S. is O157:H7; however, many other serogroups can cause disease due to Serogroups O26, O111, and O103 are the non-O157 serogroups that most often cause illness in people in the U.S. Overall, the non-O157 serogroups are less likely than E. coli O157:H7 to cause severe illness; however, some non-O157 STEC serogroups can cause the most severe manifestations of illness. Prior to 2008, STEC was reported under multiple disease codes, depending on the serogroup. One reporting code captured only serogroup O157:H7. Another reporting code captured known serogroups other than O157:H7. Previous Florida Morbidity Statistics Reports included only the disease code for E. coli O157:H7. However, in 2008, these reporting codes were combined into one and E. coli O157:H7 is no longer separated from the non-O157 strains. The figures in this report reflect cases due to infections with all STEC serogroups reported over the past 10 years, not just serogroup O157:H7; therefore, they cannot be compared to E. coli O157:H7 numbers in reports prior to 2008. Disease Abstract A total of 85 confirmed and probable cases were reported in 2010, of which 72 (84.71%) were confirmed. An additional 154 suspected cases were reported in 2010, but are not included in this summary . Of those 154 suspected cases, 57 (37.01%) were pending final Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) results when the 2010 disease reporting database closed. Though these cases could not be counted as confirmed, it is likely that some portion of them will later be laboratory confirmed. In 2009, only one case was pending final CDC result when the database closed. Twenty-one cases (24.71%) were classified as outbreak-associated. Three cases were acquired in states other than Florida and 10 were acquired outside the U.S. Approximately one-third (24) of the confirmed cases were caused by serogroup O157:H7, three were caused by O157:H unknown, and one was caused by O157:non-motile.

Escherichia coli, Shiga Toxin-Producing Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 The incidence rate for STEC has varied over the last ten years (Figure 1). One source of variation is large outbreaks involving food products distributed across multiple states or other common source exposures such as petting zoos. In 2010, there was a 25.3% decrease in incidence of new cases in comparison to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, the number of cases reported was highest in the early summer months (Figure 2). Incidence was greatest among children and teenagers (Figure 3). Incidence was at or below the previous five-year average in all age groups except those aged 15 to 19 years and those aged 35-44 years (Figure 3).

In 2009, only one case was pending final CDC result when the database closed. Twenty-one cases (24.71%) were classified as outbreak-associated. Three cases were acquired in states other than Florida and 10 were acquired outside the U.S. Approximately one third (24) of the confirmed cases were caused by serogroup O157:H7, three were caused by O157:H unknown, and one was caused by O157:non-motile. Non-O157 serogroups included O103:H2 (11), O26:H11 O (2), O111:NM (2), O145:NM (2), O153:H2 (2), O rough:H11 (1), O undetermined:H14 (1), O undetermined:H16 (1), O O69:H11 (1), O76:NM (1), O91:H14 (1), and one unknown strain.

A void cross-contamination by ensuring utensils, counter tops, cutting boards, and sponges are cleaned, or do not come in contact with raw meat. Do not allow the fluids from raw meat to come in contact with other foods. W ash your hands thoroughly before, during, and after food preparation and after toilet use. W ash your hands after coming into contact with any animals or their environment. Take special precautions with young children in petting zoos or with farm animals, as these settings may harbor the organism.

In 2010, there was a 25.3% decrease in incidence of new cases in comparison to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, the number of cases reported was highest in the early summer months (Figure 2). Incidence was greatest among children and teenagers (Figure 3). Incidence was at or below the previous five-year average in all age groups except those aged 15 to 19 years and those aged 35-44 years (Figure 3). STEC cases were reported in 25 of 67 counties in Florida. Escherichia coli Shiga Toxin-Producing Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida, 2010 94Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Giardiasis Disease Abstract The incidence rate for giardiasis declined by about half over the years from 1999 to 2005 but increased slightly starting in 2006 (Figure 1). In 2010, there was a 56.01% increase in comparison to the five-year average incidence from 2005 to 2009, at least partly due to a case definition change (see below). A total of 2,139 cases were reported in 2010, higher than the number reported in 2009 (1,981 cases). Of the 2,139 cases reported in 2010, 98.8% were classified as confirmed. Each year, the number of cases increase in the summer and early fall months (Figure 2). The month of August historically has the largest number of reported cases; in 2010, the largest number of cases (144) in fact occurred in August. In 2010, all months except January exceeded the previous five-year average number of cases. Among the 2,139 giardiasis cases reported in 2010, 106, or 5.0%, were reported as outbreak-associated. Over 60.6% of all reported cases indicated infection had been acquired in Florida. There were 776 cases that were reported as acquired outside of the U.S., with 548 of these cases, or 70.6%, indicating infection was acquired in Cuba. The giardiasis case definition was changed in August 2008 to include asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed infection. Previously, only symptomatic laboratory-confirmed cases met the case definition. It is likely the large increase in reported cases of giardiasis in 2009 and again in 2010 was due to the change in case definition. In particular , there are certain populations, such as refugee populations, that are regularly screened for giardiasis, in whom asymptomatic cases are identified. In 2009, 43.0% of cases were reported without an onset date and that proportion rose to 47.5% in 2010. Note: In 2011, the giardiasis case definition was changed again, to require symptoms as well as clinical illness, and the number of reported cases is expected to decline as a result. Figure 2.

This is particularly important in childcare centers and after toilet use, before handling food, and before eating. Additional cases can be avoided when children with diarrhea are kept home from child care centers. Other ways to prevent Giaridia include the following strategies: A void eating food and swallowing water from recreational water sources (such as ponds and lakes) that might be contaminated. A void drinking untreated water from shallow wells, lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, streams, or untreated ice. A void drinking tap water when traveling in countries where the water may not be adequately filtered and treated. Boil water of unsafe or uncertain origin for the most reliable way to make water safe for drinking. Use filters and chemical disinfection (including chlorination) for surface water supplies, but the ef fective - ness of chlorine is dependent on several factors, including pH, temperature, and organic content of the water. A void use of recreational water venues for two weeks after symptoms resolve if you have had Giardia - associated diarrhea. References L.K. Pickering, C.J. Baker, S.S. Long, and J.A.

Nationally, the rate decreased from 119.7 to 99.1 (per 100,000 population) from 2006-2009. From 2008 to 2009, there was a dramatic decline (11.2%) in gonorrhea cases in Florida and an additional decrease of 3.5% from 2009 to 2010. However, even with these decreases in disease incidence, 20,164 cases of gonorrhea were reported in Florida for a rate of 106.0 cases per 100,000 population, which is more than five times higher than the Healthy People 2010 goal of 19.0 per 100,000 population. T wo congenital cases were reported in 2010. Figure 1.

Counties With The Highest Rate of Gonorrhea per 100,000 Population, Florida, 2010 Among reportable infections, gonorrhea remains the second most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection in 15-24 year olds in Florida. The age-specific case rate for 15-24 year olds in 2010 (528.3 per 100,000) was slightly lower than the rate in 2009 (535.5 per 100,000). However , this rate was three times higher than the second highest age-adjusted rate, which was in 25-34 year olds. Females infected with gonorrhea, on average, were younger than males, 22.5 years old and 26.9 years old respectively . The disease distribution reveals that an additional 16% of all reported cases of gonorrhea are reported in populations between the ages of 25-29; whereas those under 25 account for 64% of reported infection. More cases of gonorrhea have been reported in the 20-24 age group consistently since 1998, when compared to other five- year age groups. Trends indicate gender differences in prevalence are less apparent than for other sexually transmitted diseases. Males and females each account for about half of cases reported (49.3% and 50.7%, respectively). Reported cases of gonorrhea in females decreased by 17.5% from 2006 to 2010. Female cases of gonorrhea decreased by 5% from 2009 to 2010. Among females, the highest rate (634.6 per 100,000) and number of cases (3,716) was reported in persons aged 15-19 years. The second highest rate was among females aged 20-24 years (621.3 per 100,000). Approximately 6% of infected women were pregnant at the time of the disease diagnosis. The highest number of male cases was reported in the 20-24 years age group, 3,332 cases, for a rate of 537.4 cases per 100,000 population. The 2009 data showed an almost identical rate of 536.6 cases per 100,000 population. The overall number of cases and rate per 100,000 for males increased in 2010. Young men aged 15-19 years had the second highest rate (325.7) among their gender . Non-Hispanic blacks account for approximately two thirds of reported gonorrhea cases in Florida. The rate was 389.4 per 100,000 population for non-Hispanic blacks compared to 30.7 per 100,000 for non-Hispanic whites. In 2010, non-Hispanic blacks aged 15-24 years had a case rate of 1,887.1 per 100,000. This rate was 13 times higher than the second highest rate, which was in non-Hispanic whites aged 15-24 years (150.62 per 100,000). Increases in cases from 2009 to 2010 were noted in black males and females, white males, and Hispanic females. Table 2.

One percent of these infections occurred in heterosexual populations, while 71% occurred among those who identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). Of those who reported a gonorrhea and chlamydia infection within the same year, 58.9% were female and 39.2% were heterosexual males. Conversely, those who reported a gonorrhea and syphilis infection in the same period were primarily identified as MSM risk behavior. Prevention According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the surest way to avoid transmission of any STD is to abstain from sexual contact, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and CDC recommends annual gonorrhea screening for all sexually active women aged <25 years or younger, as well as for older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners. When used consistently and correctly, latex condom can reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea. Symptoms of gonorrhea may not be noticed or present and may vary from person to person. Common symptoms for women are pain or burning during urination, increased vaginal discharge, and/or bleeding between periods. Common symptoms for men are pain or burning during urination, penile discharge, or painful or swollen testicles. Women and men who are told they have a gonorrhea infection and are treated for it should notify all of their recent sex partners (sex partners within the preceding 60 days) so they can see a health care provider and be evaluated for any possible STD exposure. Sexual activity should not resume until all sex partners have been examined and, if necessary, treated.

In 2010, the incidence rate was 22.7% higher than the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, 191 cases were reported; all were confirmed. The number of cases reported is typi - cally highest in the winter during the months of December through February , but there was significant disease through April 2010 and an early start in September 2010 (Figure 2). In 2010, the number of cases exceeded the previous five-year average in summer and fall (July-December), but in the spring exceeded the five-year average only in March and April. Nearly all cases of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae are sporadic. The highest reported incidence rates occur in those aged under one year or in those aged >85 years (Figure 3). In 2010, the incidence rates met or exceeded the previous five-year average in all age groups except those aged 45 to 54 years. The incidence of disease in males and females does not differ significantly (0.9 per 100,000 and 1.2 per 100,000 population, respectively). Invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae was reported in nearly 80% (54) of the 67 counties in Florida. Counties with the highest incidence rates were distributed throughout the state.

Conversely, those who reported a gonorrhea and syphilis infection in the same period primarily identified a MSM risk behavior. Prevention As other reportable STD infections have increased, the number of gonorrhea cases has consistently decreased in the past years. A shift in treatment guidelines and recommendations for screening of women under the age of 25 have positively influenced gonorrhea trends. The increases noted among certain racial or ethnic groups may be an artifact of improved reporting of core variables but are not necessarily increases in cases of disease. In spite of successes, core areas of infection persist in pockets of the state and correlate to socioeconomic indicators often unrecognized in data reporting. Gonorrhea prevalence continues to impact minority populations and continues to increase among MSM and HIV positive populations. To further understand the factors contributing to the acquisition of the disease, accurate, timely, and comprehensive reporting and disease investigation must continue. Additionally, core clusters of infection must be understood. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual gonorrhea screening for all sexually active women under age 26, as well as for older women with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners. Please see Section 4: Summary of Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance for additional information about the trends in antimicrobial resistance for gonorrhea. Haemophilus influenzae Invasive Disease: Crude Data Number of Cases 191 2010 incidence rate per 100,000 1.0 % change from average 5 year (2005-2009) reported incidence rate 22.7% Age (yrs) Mean 54.9 Median 64 Min-Max 0 - 99 Disease Abstract The incidence rate for all invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae has gradually increased over the past ten years (Figure 1). In 2010, the incidence rate was 22.7% higher than the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, 191 cases were reported; all were confirmed. The number of cases reported is typically highest in the winter during the months of December through February, but there was significant disease through April 2010 and an early start in September 2010 (Figure 2). In 2010, the number of cases exceeded the previous five-year average in summer and fall (July-December), but in the spring exceeded the five-year average only in March and April. Nearly all cases of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae are sporadic. The highest reported incidence rates occur in those aged under one year or in those over 85 years (Figure 3).

Meningitis and septicemia due to Hemophilus influenzae type b, formerly very common in preschool-age children, have almost been eradicated. In 2010, there were four (unrelated) cases of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae serotype b in children under age five, all of whom were hospitalized and recovered. This represents an increase from the previous year where there was one case. The children ranged in age from 4 months - 13 months; two were white boys, one was a white girl and one was a black boy.

Haemophilus influenzae Invasive Disease Cases and Incidence Rate* by County, Florida, 2010 103Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Hepatitis A Disease Abstract In 2010, 178 cases of hepatitis A were reported in Florida. This represents a slight decrease from the 191 cases reported in 2009. In 2010, 78% of hepatitis A cases were classified as confirmed, 62% of cases were in males, 76% of cases were in whites, and 41% were in Hispanics. Most cases were apparently isolated events and only 10% of people with cases reported contact with a person with confirmed or suspected hepatitis A infection in the two to six weeks prior to their illness. Approximately 33% of cases reported a travel history outside the U.S. and Canada in the two to six weeks prior to their illness. Additionally , 19% of cases reported that a household member had traveled outside of the U.S. or Canada. Less than 1% of cases were either a child or an employee in a daycare center, preschool, or nursery and only 3% of reported cases were employed as a food-handler during the two weeks prior to symptom onset. The incidence rate for hepatitis A in Florida has declined markedly since 2002 (Figure 1), which mirrors a similar decline observed nationally. The annual incidence in Florida from 2007 to 2010 was near one case per 100,000. This is a substantial decrease from the annual incidence of four to six cases per 100,000 observed between 1998 and 2002. The decrease in Florida, and nationally, is likely due to increased use of the vaccine to protect against hepatitis A virus, which first became commercially available in 1995. However, there has been little if any further decline in incidence since 2007. Figure 2.

However, this is not a requirement for childcare or school entry in Florida. The doses should be spaced at least six months apart. A combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is available for adults over 18 years old, and is administered in three doses. 105Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Prevention Currently, the single antigen, two-dose hepatitis A vaccine is recommended as part of the routine immunization schedule for all children, starting at age one. However, this is not a requirement for childcare or school entry in Florida. The doses should be spaced at least six months apart. A combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vac-cine is available for adults aged >18 years, and is administered in three doses. In addition to routine childhood immunization, hepatitis A vaccine is also recommended for people without a documented history of vaccine or past disease who are at increased risk of infection, including: those traveling to developing countries, close contacts of adopted children newly arriving from developing countries, men who have sex with men (MSM), injection and non-injection drug users, persons with a clotting factor disorder , persons with chronic liver disease (at risk for fulminant hepatitis A), and persons who have occupational risk for infection. Other efforts to prevent hepatitis A infection should focus on disrupting transmission through: good personal hygiene, hand washing after use of the toilet and before preparing food for others, and washing fruits and vegetables before eating. Illness among food-handlers or persons in a childcare setting should be promptly identified and reported to allow prompt action to be taken to prevent further spread of the disease in those settings. In outbreak settings, immune-globulin may be administered to at-risk contacts of infected individuals, particularly children under one year and adults aged >40 years. Recently updated guidelines, based on results from a clinical trial, recom - mend using vaccine rather than immune globulin for post-exposure prophylaxis in healthy individuals aged between 1 and 40 years. All post-exposure prophylaxis should be administered within two weeks of exposure.

The 2010 rate was 22.4% lower than the average from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, 94% of the 315 reported cases were confirmed. There is no seasonal trend for acute hepatitis B infection (Figure 2). Overall, 97% of the acute hepatitis B cases were classified as sporadic. The highest historical incidence rates occurred in the group aged 25 to 34 years. During 2010, the incidence rate in this group was still high, but the highest incidence was among those aged 35 to 44 years, which was also true for 2007-2009. In 2010, the incidence rates were lower than the previous five-year average in all age groups except those aged 65-74 years (Figure 3). The incidence of hepatitis B is lowest in people aged < 19 years. Rates have always been low in children, and are even lower with widespread immunization. Males continue to have a higher incidence than females (2.1 and 1.2 per 100,000, respectively). The age-specific infection rates suggest that a cohort with high levels of immunity due to immunization has reached age 25 years. Figure 2.

In addition, in healthcare settings, implementing universal precautions for individuals in contact with body fluids will reduce risk to healthcare workers. High-risk groups for infection include: drug users who share needles, healthcare workers who have contact with infected blood, MSM (men who have sex with men), people who have multiple sexual partners, household contacts of infected persons, and infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B carriers. 109Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Figure 4.

Hepatitis B (HBsAG+) Pregnant Women Disease Abstract There were 438 pregnant women who tested positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+) in 2010, which is a decrease from 598 women in 2009. During 2010, there was one Florida-born infant identified as a perinatal case of hepatitis B (disease code 07744). The child had received all three recommended doses of hepatitis B-containing vaccine and also received hepatitis B immune globulin after birth. In 2009, there were no Florida-born infants identified as perinatal cases of hepatitis B. Prevention Prevention begins with early identification of HBsAg-positive pregnant women. When a pregnant woman enters the hospital for delivery, the accompanying prenatal record alerts the hospital's maternity staff of the mom's positive HBsAg status and the subsequent need for prophylactic treatment for the infant within the 12-hour time period following birth. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is prepared from human plasma known to contain a high titer of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). A regimen combining HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine is 85%-95% effective in preventing HBV infection when administered at birth to infants born to HBsAg+ mothers. HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 12 hours of birth. The second dose should be given at one month of age and the third dose at six months of age. Dose three of hepatitis B vaccine should not be given before six months of age. These infants should have serologic testing at 9 to 18 months of age to determine if a protective antibody response developed after vaccination. Infants who do not respond to the primary vaccination series should be given three additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine in a zero, one to two, four to six month schedule, and have the HBsAg and anti-HBs blood tests repeated to determine response. Vaccine for children and adults is also available in combination vaccines.

It was low from 2005 to 2008 but has been increasing since 2008 (Figure 1). In 2010, there was a 97.0% increase in comparison to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. A total of 105 cases were reported in 2010. Fifty-three percent of the cases were classified as confirmed. The hepatitis C acute surveillance case definition changed in 2008, leading to more cases being classified as confirmed compared to previous reporting no seasonal trend for acute hepatitis C infection (Figure 2). In 2010, no acute hepatitis C cases were classified as outbreak-associated and no deaths were reported. Some acute infections may have been erroneously reported or classified as chronic infections. Newly recognized chronic infections in young adults share many risk factors and other characteristics with acute cases. Figure 2. Hepatitis C, Acute Cases by Month of Onset, Florida, 2010 Overall, the highest incidence rates for 2010 occurred among persons aged 20 to 44 years, which is consistent with historical trends. However, when the cases are broken down into smaller age groups, the historical trend is not as consistent. In 2010, the incidence rates were higher than the previous five-year average in all age groups in which cases were reported except for those aged 15 to 19 years, 65 to 74 years, and >84 years old (Figure 3).Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is prepared from human plasma known to contain a high titer of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs).

Hepatitis C, Acute Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida 2010 References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Hepatitis C Virus InfectionAmongAdolescents and Young Adults --- Massachusetts, 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Lead Poisoning, 2009 Disease Abstract Clinically, lead poisoning is defined as a blood lead concentration of 10 \u00b5g/dL or greater. Lead can cause adverse effects at blood levels with no clinical detectable symptoms. However, the long-term effects of the disease may be severe and include neurological defects and cognitive impairments. Adverse health effects are more pronounced and more clinically evident at higher levels of blood lead. Deterioration of lead-based paint in housing built before 1978 continues to be the most important lead source for children in Florida. There are an estimated 1.4 million homes in Florida with lead-based paint. Lead tainted dust can be ingested or inhaled. Children aged <6 years (72 months) are at highest risk for lead poisoning because they are more likely to place lead contaminated hands and toys in their mouth. Over the last three decades, blood levels among U.S. children have been declining due to the removal of lead from residential paint, and especially removal of lead from gasoline. Despite these policy changes, lead exposure continues to be of public health concern for young children. The Florida Lead Poisoning Prevention and Healthy Homes (LPPHH) program recommends blood lead screening among children aged <72 months who are at high risk for lead poisoning. Children at high risk include children living in pre-1978 housing, Medicaid-eligible children, children adopted outside of the U.S., refugees, and immigrants. There were 34% more children screened for lead poisoning in Florida in 2009 than in 2005 (Figure 1). The increase in screening numbers and rates over the five-year period may be partially due to the increase in the number of testing facilities that are routinely conducting blood lead screening of children. Conversely, the number of reported lead poisoning cases declined by 39% between 2005 and 2009. This reduction in the number of cases from 2005 to 2009 does not necessarily mean that lead poisoning prevalence rates among Florida children aged <72 months are declining. The population screened each year may not consistently represent the population at high risk for lead poisoning. T o get a better understanding of trends in lead poisoning, the LPPHH program is planning to perform analyses to determine screening rates (from 2008 to 2010) among Medicaid-eligible children, the largest high risk group for lead poisoning in Florida. Figure 1. Reported Blood Lead Screenings and Newly Identified Cases of Lead Poisoning, Florida, 2005 to 2009to the increase in the number of testing facilities that are routinely conducting blood lead screening of children. Conversely, the number of reported lead poisoning cases declined by 39% between 2005 and 2009. This reduction in the number of cases from 2005 to 2009 does not necessarily mean that lead poisoning prevalence rates among Florida children less than 72 months old are declining. The population screened each year may not consistently represent the population at high risk for lead poisoning. To get a better understanding of trends in lead poisoning, the LPPHH program is planning to perform analyses to determine screening rates (2008 to 2010) among Medicaid-eligible children, the largest high risk group for lead poisoning in Florida.

Children in this age group are at increased risk for lead poisoning and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Florida Medicaid Services highly recommend that they receive initial blood lead screen - ing. Over the past five years, most new cases were reported with blood lead levels (BLLs) ranging from 10 to 14 g/dL. In 2009, 60% of reported new cases in children aged 12 to 23 months had BLLs within this range. Figure 3.

Of the number of new cases with reported race, the majority were either white or black (Figure 4). For 43% (N=82) of the blood lead test data reported in 2009, race was not reported. Therefore, the 2009 data may not clearly portray the distribution of lead poisoned children by race. Figure 5 illustrates the number of reported new cases of lead poisoning in Florida by gender for 2009. Of the 190 reported new cases, there were 89 (47%) females and 101 (53%) males. There were a slightly larger proportion of elevated BLLs in males versus females. There was a larger gender difference among whites (12%) than among blacks. The case rate, defined as the number of reported new cases divided by the number of children screened, was computed for each county. In 2009, the case rate for lead poisoning was higher in some rural counties such as Nassau, Jefferson and Walton (8.9 to 16.6 cases per 1,000 children screened) than in urban counties such as Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Hillsborough. The case rates in these three urban counties with active screening programs varied from 0.5 to 1.4 cases per 1,000 children screened. However , comparing the case rate between counties may be misleading since rates will be highly af fected by the proportion of the popula - tion screened. Smaller counties tend to have lower numbers of at-risk children compared to larger counties. Furthermore, a small number of cases detected among a small group of children screened for the disease may result in a higher case rate. For example, twenty-five times as many lead poisoning cases were identified in Miami-Dade County (N=49) in 2009 than in Nassau County (N=2) during this time period. However , the Miami- Dade case rate (1.2 cases per 1,000 children screened) was lower than Nassau County (12.2 cases per 1,000 children screened), partly because more than 200 times as many children were screened for lead poisoning in Miami-Dade County (N=41,518) than in Nassau County (N=164).43.2%3.2% 26.3% Black White Unknown47% 53% Female MaleFigure 4.

However, the Miami-Dade case rate (1.2 cases per 1,000 children screened) was lower than Nassau County (12.2 cases per 1,000 children screened), partly because more than 200 times as many children were screened for lead poisoning in Miami-Dade County (N=41,518) than in Nassau County (N=164). 118Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Lead Poisoning Cases and Case Rates* in Those under 72 Months of Age by County, Florida, 2009 Prevention Lead poisoning is a preventable disease. The most effective method for preventing lead poisoning is to elimi - nate lead sources, especially from homes or areas that are frequently visited by children. Children who are at high risk for lead exposures should be tested and follow-up care should be provided for those who test positive for lead poisoning. Providers, parents, caregivers, and household members should be educated on the risks associated with lead poisoning. The LPPHH program provides guidance to county health department case managers on screening requirements and medical management for children aged <72 months. Environmental inspections are recommended for those children with BLL 15\u00b5g/dL to identify the source of lead. Mitigation strategies are recommended to prevent further exposures to lead.Lead Poisoning Cases and Case Rates* in those under 72 Months of Age by County, Florida, 2009 119Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Additional Information The Florida LPPHH program website also includes additional information and disease statistics at:http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/medicine/lead/index.

In 2010, the incidence rate was 9.1% higher than the average from 2005 to 2009. In 2010, 172 cases were reported, of which 100% were classified as confirmed cases and 5.8% were acquired outside of Florida. The number of cases reported tends to increase in the summer months. In 2010, the number of cases exceeded the previous five-year average for many of the months, most notably March, April, June, and November (Figure 2). Only one legionellosis case in a Florida resident in 2010 was associated with an outbreak. This case was associated with staying at a hotel in Miami-Dade County where an investigation involving 10 cases occurred, beginning in 2009. Additional cases were detected, but were all in foreign or out-of-state persons. (See the Summary of Notable Outbreaks and Case Investigations section of the 2009 report.) Figure 2. Legionellosis Cases by Month of Onset, Florida, 2010 The highest incidence rates continue to occur among adults aged 45 years and older with rates ranging from 1.0 per 100,000 in the 45-54 age group to 2.8 per 100,000 in the 65-74 age group. In 2010, the incidence rates were higher than the previous five-year average in most age groups. Males continue to have a higher incidence than females and this gap widened in 2010 (1.3 and 0.6 per 100,000, respectively).Prevention Lead poisoning is a preventable disease.

Organisms are shed in the urine, amniotic fluid and placenta, and can survive for weeks to months in water or moist environments. At greatest risk are those working with animals, or those exposed to wet (freshwater) conditions, such as sewer or sugarcane field workers, military personnel, and outdoor enthusiasts. The disease is more common in males, primarily because of occupational or recreational related exposures. The disease appears to be emerging in peri-urban areas, and flood conditions have also led to outbreaks in urban environments in other countries. In 2010, the case definition was updated to add a prob - able category so that people with a single serum microagglutination (MA T) titer >200, a positive EIA IgM, or detection of pathogenic Leptospira by nucleic acid test (NAT) may be classified as having cases. Disease abstractTwo probable cases of leptospirosis were reported in 2010. One case involved a black man aged 72 years who was exposed and became ill while traveling in Jamaica. The second case involved a white man aged 17 years who is believed to have been exposed while hog hunting in North Carolina when he splashed creek water onto his face and may have swallowed some of the water. Both were treated and recovered. Prevention At-risk workers should use appropriate personal protective equipment including boots, gloves and aprons; rodent populations should be controlled; and contact with potentially infectious animal urine, water , and other materials should be avoided.

In 2010, there was a 21.9% increase in comparison to the previous five-year average incidence. A total of 54 cases were reported in 2010, which is more than double what was reported in 2009 (24 cases). Historically , the number of cases reported tends to increase slightly in the late summer months with a high number of cases in August, September, and October. In 2010, a similar trend was observed but with notably early peaks in January, as well as in May and June (Figure 2).

After de- clines in the reported incidence of Lyme disease for most of the decade, there has been an overall increasing incidence since 2007, although incidence dropped slightly from 2009 to 2010 (Figure 1). In 2010, 84 imported and Florida-acquired cases were reported, which represented a 34.9% increase over the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. This may be partly attributed to a change in the case definition in 2008, as well as to a true increase in cases. Sixty-seven percent of cases were classified as confirmed in 2010 and 33% as probable. Almost three- quarters of cases were acquired outside Florida, with 74% (62 cases) reported as imported. However , the proportion of Florida-acquired cases has increased in recent years from 13% (1 1 cases) reported in 2008, to 20% (22 cases) reported in 2009, to 26% (22 cases) reported in 2010. Exposures in the northeast and upper Midwest U.S., particularly New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Wisconsin accounted for the largest number of cases. Highest case incidence was in the summer with peak incidence in July, but cases occurred year round (Figure 2). Winter is a period of decreased tick activity in most northern states. Thirty-seven percent of imported cases (23 cases) presented with early disease manifestations compared with 55% (12 cases) of Florida acquired cases. Eighty-six percent (12 cases) of all imported cases with early disease manifestations reported erythema migrans (EM), compared with 50% (6 cases) of those that were Florida-acquired. Figure 2.

This general trend is consistent with the previous five-year average for age; however, the age groups in Florida tend to be older than the nationally reported peak incidence group of those 45 - 54 years old. The median age for Florida-acquired cases is 44 years and it is 52 years for non-Florida acquired cases. One reason age may tend to be higher for cases where illness was acquired outside the state is that more of them are identified later in the course of the disease, with 63% of imported cases demonstrating late manifestations compared to 45% of locally-acquired cases.

Lyme Disease Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida 2010 Prevention The most effective prevention for individuals is to avoid human and pet exposure to ticks by using the following strategies: A void tick infested areas. Cover exposed skin as much as possible. W ear light-colored clothing to better see ticks. T uck in pant legs and button sleeves. Apply permethrin to clothing and DEET to skin (per CDC recommendations). Inspect children, pets, and adults for ticks immediately following likely exposure. Use appropriate veterinary products as recommended by a veterinarian to prevent tick exposure to pets. Use landscaping measures around the home to reduce ground cover to reduce contact with ticks and use any type of fencing around a home. Bathe soon after being in tick habitats to decrease risk of infection in endemic areas. Promptly remove any ticks found attached to children, adults, or pets. Use fine tweezers or a tissue to protect fingers, grasp the tick close to the skin, and gently pull straight out without twisting. Do not use bare fingers to crush ticks. Wash hands following tick removal. As most Florida cases are acquired in Lyme-endemic areas of the northeastern U.S., these prevention mea - sures are especially important while visiting those areas.disease continues to be most frequently identified in whites (86%) and non-Hispanics (83%), although 7% of cases involved persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Lyme disease was reported in residents of 38 Florida counties, but only 16 counties reported cases as acquired in Florida.

All except P. knowlesi are transmitted from people to people via the bite and blood-feeding behavior of mosquitos of the genus Anopheles . Non-human primates act as the reservoir for P. knowlesi . Malaria was endemic in Florida up until the 1940s. Currently , nearly all cases are travelers returning to the state from malaria endemic regions of the world, though competent vectors do exist in the state, providing the potential for local transmission. The incidence rate for malaria in Florida declined for several years (Figure 1) until 2008; 139 cases were reported in Florida residents in 2010. In 2010, the number of cases more than doubled as compared to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009. Of the 139 cases reported in 2010, four had onset dates in 2009. An additional two cases reported in 2011 had onset dates in 2010 bringing the total of cases with onset dates in 2010 to 137 cases. More cases are reported during the summer and early fall months, which correlates with the rainy season in source countries such as Haiti, as well as the summer travel season for Florida residents, but cases in Florida are reported year-round (Figure 2). High incidence rates have been consistent among those in the 20 to 34 age group, and this trend persisted during 2010 (Figure 3). The mean age of reported malaria cases in Florida is 44 years (range: 6-78). For 136 cases with onset dates in 2010, 1 14 (84%) were diagnosed with P. falci- parum, 16 (12%) with P. vivax, 2 (1%) with ovale, 1 with P. malariae (<1%), and 3 (2%) with undetermined species. Eighty-one percent of cases were non-white and 60% were male.

Malaria Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 One case of P. falciparum malaria with cryptic origin (suspected to be Florida-acquired) was reported in Duval County during November 2010. The ill person had extensive U.S. travel but had not recently been in any airports that provided direct flights to malaria endemic countries. Sixty percent of cases with onset in 2010 were in people who had recent travel history to Caribbean countries (Haiti, Dominican Republic and Jamaica), 26% traveled to Africa, 9% to Asia, 3% to South America, and 2% to Central America. Of those for whom addi-tional data were available (84 out of 136 total cases with onset in 2010), the largest proportion (62%) acquired malaria while visiting relatives or friends. Persons \"visiting friends and relatives\" or VFRs are considered a high-risk group since any prior immunity may have waned and they tend not to take proper malaria prevention precautions. Other reasons for travel to malaria endemic areas were missionary/volunteer work (1 1%), tourism (7%), and business (10%). Immigrants to Florida made up 10% of the cases. Eighty-six percent of cases reported not using anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis, 6% reported missing doses, and 8% reported taking all doses as scheduled.0510152025 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec MonthNumber of Cases Previous 5 year average 2010Figure 2.

Malaria Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 133Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Prevention No vaccine is currently available. Travelers to malaria-endemic countries should consult with their doctors to make sure they receive an appropriate preventative chemoprophylactic regimen and should also take the full course of chemoprophylaxis as prescribed. A number of factors should be taken into consideration prior to prescribing chemoprophylaxis including: risk, the species of malaria present, drug resistance, and how well the drug is tolerated. Following these personal protection measures can also help prevent malaria infection: A void contact with mosquitoes by using an insect repellent containing DEET or other EPA-approved ingredient. Remain in well-screened areas. Keep skin covered in clothing. Use insecticide-treated bed nets.

The person with measles, a resident of Florida, reported travel throughout two European countries approximately three weeks prior to symptom onset. The person' s vaccination history was unknown, though immunity to mumps and varicella was reported. The person was born before 1957 and reported living abroad until 1960. This case was classified as internationally imported given the exposure was outside the country, with rash onset within 21 days after entering the U.S., and the case was not linked to local transmission. Countries in Europe have experienced increases in measles activity over the past several years, with several countries being classified as measles endemic. Measles vaccination rates have recently fallen in many of those countries, partly due to unfounded concerns about vaccine safety . Measles is a disease of urgent public health importance. Each case requires tracking all contacts and conducting interviews to assess susceptibility and focus the public health response. Florida has many pos - sible sources of infection due to the many foreign visitors each year , the ease of international travel, and the increasing incidence of measles in the U.S. and abroad. When a case is identified in another state or country , all possible contacts in Florida are tracked in order to identify other potential cases and prevent continued transmission. Prevention Vaccination against measles is recommended for all children after their first birthday. Two doses of measles vaccine (preferably as MMR) are required for entry and attendance in kindergarten through twelfth grade. All children attending or entering childcare facilities or family daycare must be age-appropriately vaccinated with one or two doses of measles vaccine. At least one dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for adults born during or after 1957.

There are many different serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis . The common ones in the United States include A, B, C, W-135, and Y. The reported incidence rate for meningococcal disease has declined gradually over the previous 10 years, and in 2010 was less than half of what it was 10 years ago (Figure 1). The long-term downward trend has reversed in 2009 and 2010, mostly because of an increase in W -135 infections in South Florida. In 2010, 60 cases were reported, of which 59 were confirmed. There is a general seasonal increase in cases in late winter and early spring (Figure 2). There were 16 cases related to a PFGE laboratory-confirmed cluster of serogroup W-135 in southeast Florida that had been previously reported (additional information is available in the article cited in the references section.)

Mercury Poisoning Disease Abstract Mercury is a naturally occurring element. Its distribution in the environment is the result of both natural and man-made processes. There are three categories of mercury, each with unique characteristics and unique potential health effects: elemental mercury, organic mercury compounds, and inorganic mercury compounds. The organic mercury compound methyl mercury is the most likely to cause adverse health ef fects in the general population. Common sources of mercury include: Elemental or metallic mercury - Broken mercury thermometers, blood pressure monitors, fluorescent light bulbs, dental amalgam, neon signs, outdoor lighting, cameras, electrical switches, batteries, and some folk medicines. Organic mercury compounds - Certain freshwater and saltwater fish, and marine mammals. Ethyl mercury and methyl mercury are used medically as fungicides and antibacterials. Inorganic mercury compounds - Sometimes used in skin lightening creams and as antiseptic creams and ointments, as well as in folk medicines. Used in preserving solutions for biological specimens. Used as a reagent in analytical chemistry reactions, photography , and metal etching solutions.140Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Mercury poisoning is diagnosed by laboratory testing. Elevated levels of mercury are defined as >10 micrograms per liter (g/L) of urine, >10 micrograms per liter (g/L) of whole blood, or >5 micrograms per gram (g/g) of hair. However, urine mercury levels are not useful in evaluating suspected organic mercury poisoning. There were 12 confirmed cases of mercury poisoning reported in Merlin during 2010. However , there were 13 cases where the exposure incident occurred during 2010. All 13 cases with their exposure incident occurring during 2010 will be included in the following analysis. The primary potential source of mercury exposure was identified to be fish consumption. Twelve out of thirteen cases had eaten fish within a month of reporting, while one patient had an unknown source of exposure. Three of the affected people reported eating less than 12 ounces of fish in a week; six cases reported eating 12 to 30 ounces, and two cases ate 30 to 60 ounces per week. Two cases did not report the amount of fish consumed. For 2010, a majority of the confirmed cases were reported from Miami-Dade (N=7, 53.8%) and Pinellas (N=2, 15.4%) counties. Other counties that reported one case are Brevard, Broward, Hillsborough, and Leon. Cases were predominantly male (N=9, 69.2%). The majority of mercury poisoning cases were reported among those aged 35 to 64 years (N=11, 84.9%). Cases ranged from age 4 to 64 years; the mean and median age was 46.3 and 48 years respectively. Approximately 62% (N=8) of the reported cases of mercury poisoning were among whites (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic), while 31% (N=4) reported unknown race and ethnicity . Among cases with known race and ethnicity, 15.4% were Hispanic (N=2). Analysis of Varied Data Sources for Mercury Poisoning Events 2005 - 2009 In order to better estimate the burden of mercury-related poisonings, de-identified hospitalization and emergen - cy department (ED) visit data from the Agency for Healthcare Administration, and mortality data from the Office of Vital Statistics were searched for mercury-related poisonings using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Selected codes were 985.0, E866.1 for ED visits and hospital admissions, and T56.1 for deaths. The data were extracted for one or more ICD codes present in the primary or secondary diagnosis fields from years 2005 through 2009 (the most recent year for which data was available). There were a total of 57 ED visits and 19 hospitalizations related to mercury poisoning reported from 2005 through 2009 in Florida. No mercury-related deaths were recorded during this time. Due to lack of personal identifiers in the hospitalization data, reports identified in ED visit and hospitalization data were not matched with cases identified in Merlin data and are not unduplicated. Figure 1. Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalizations for Mercury Poisoning by Year, Florida, 2005 to 2009There were a total of 57 ED visits and 19 hospitalizations related to mercury poisoning reported from 2005 through 2009 in Florida. No mercury-related deaths were recorded during this time. Due to lack of personal identifiers in the hospitalization data, reports identified in ED visit and hospitalization data were not matched with cases identified in Merlin data and are not unduplicated.

Three patients were recorded as unknown race. Approximately 26% of the visits or hospitalizations reported Hispanic ethnicity. Neither the source of mercury related to the poisoning nor the type of mercury (elemental versus organic) is available in the hospital ED or inpatient records, but it is not presumed to be primarily related to fish consump - tion. Given the young age of those presenting at the ED, there may be more cases related to exposure to elemental forms of mercury such as broken devices or through other exposure routes such as fungicides or home remedies, although the data are not available to explore these concerns.Figure 3.

Cases in 2010 ranged from persons aged 4 to 52 years (Figure 2). Of the ten cases, eight were reported as confirmed and two as probable. One case was acquired outside of the U.S. and one was hospitalized. Five of the cases received mumps-containing vaccine, two had no history of vaccination, and three had unknown immunization status. The 10 confirmed cases represent a decrease from 18 confirmed cases in 2009. Incidence of mumps was relatively unchanged from 2000 to 2005. However, in 2006, there was a significant increase in cases in the U.S., especially in the college-age population. The peak in Florida activity occurred in 2007 and has declined since, decreasing in 2010 to 35.9% below the previous five-year average. One case in the 10-14 year age group was a household contact of the case in the 1-4 year age group. Figure 2.

It is also known as whooping cough. Florida pertussis rates increased steadily from 2001 through 2009 and fell slightly in 2010 (Figure 1). Case numbers went from 30 cases in 2001 (22 confirmed and 8 probable) to a peak of 497 cases in 2009 (376 confirmed and 121 probable). There were 328 cases reported in 2010 (239 confirmed and 89 probable). In the previous five years and in 2010, most cases occurred during the summer months (Figure 2). In the previ - ous years, pertussis cases were consistent between gender and race. However , in 2010, rates were higher in whites than in non-whites. As in the previous five years, most pertussis cases were identified in infants and young children. Of the 328 reported cases in 2010, 100 were reported in infants aged <12 months, too young to have completed the vaccination series (Figure 3). Of the reported people with the disease, 77 were hospitalized, and acute encephalopathy was reported in three. Two deaths occurred in infants aged <12 months who had confirmed cases. There was no record of vaccination for 196 (59.8%) cases. Ninety-one (27.74%) cases in 13 counties were outbreak-associated. Cases in adolescents and adults are often not recognized, but can be sources of infection for young children. Figure 2.

Only confirmed, probable and pos - sible case classifications meet the reportable case criteria and are reported to the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risk (SENSOR) program. The case definition for pesticide-related illness and injury is available at http://www.doh.state.fl.us/disease_ctrl/epi/surv/CaseDefinitions/Pesticide-Related_Illness.pdf. Cases are reported to the Chemical Disease Surveillance Program (CDSP) from multiple sources including: electronic laboratory reports, the Florida Poison Information Center Network (FPCIN), emergency department (ED) chief complaint data, as well as self-reports from ill individuals, co-workers, family members, and others. Recent incorporation of FPICN and ED chief complaint data into Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) has provided an additional tool for all trained county health department (CHD) users to access clinical pesticide poisoning reports. Data on pesticide-related illness and injury are currently available through 2009. From 1998 through 2009, 2,944 cases of pesticide-related illness and injuries were reported to the CDSP; 430 were identified as work-related. The CDSP received 405 case reports of acute pesticide-related illness and injuries in 2009 (Figure 1). The increase in cases seen since 2006 is related to additional cases identified as a result of direct access to the FPICN by the CDSP which has led to more complete case ascertainment. Case distribution is not uniform throughout the year with more cases reported during summer months (Figure 2). Figure 1.

The majority of cases reported that they were applying pesticides at the time of exposure (Table 1). Table 1. Activity at the Time of Pesticide Exposure for Pesticide-Related Illness and Injury Cases, Florida, 2009 Applications of a pesticide material released at the intended location (target site) and not carried from that location to another area by air are considered to be targeted applications. Pesticide exposure occurred during targeted application for 260 cases in 2009 (64.2%) (Figure 5). Pesticide drift accounted for only 13.1% of all cases.Figure 3.

The program intervenes through education and outreach activities. The program also makes recommendations for regulatory actions and changes. Prevention Tips for Pesticide Poisoning: 1. When using pesticides: Always read the label first. Strictly follow the directions. 2. Use pesticides safely: Use products only for pests indicated on the label. Use only the minimum amount of pesticide as directed by the label. T wice the amount will not do twice the job. 3. Use protective measures when handling pesticides as directed by the label: W ear impermeable gloves, long pants, and long-sleeve shirt. Change clothes after applying pesticides. W ash your hands immediately after applying pesticides. 4. Before applying a pesticide (indoors or outdoors): Remove children, their toys, and pets from the area to be sprayed. Do not put items back until the pesticide has dried or as specified by label instructions.Figure 5.

Q Fever Disease AbstractQ Fever was last summarized in the annual morbidity report in 2007. Since that time, there have been four probable cases of acute Q Fever, one case each in 2008 and 2009, and two in 2010. Three of the four cases were reported as imported from outside the U.S.; one case, reported in 2010, was acquired in Florida. The 2008 case and one of the 2010 cases involved military personnel exposed while deployed in Iraq. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report increased numbers of cases in military personnel deployed in the Middle East and Afghanistan, most likely due to endemicity in livestock in those regions. The 2009 case was exposed in India while visiting friends and relatives, and reported drinking unpasteurized milk. The 2010 case acquired in Florida reported no contact with livestock but did regularly drink unpasteurized milk shipped from another state. All four cases were in men. Three of these people were white and one was Asian. Three of them were non-Hispanic and one was Hispanic. The age range was 34 to 64 years. Q Fever is a zoonotic disease caused by infection with the rickettsial organism Coxiella burnetii . It has a global distribution and is resilient in the environment. The most common natural reservoirs are sheep, goats and cattle, but rodents and other animals can also harbor the agent. T icks are thought to play a role in maintaining animal reservoirs but are not believed to be important in transmission to humans. The agent is shed in animal birthing fluids and may be shed in milk. Transmission to humans occurs primarily through aerosols generated during parturition or from contaminated dust that can carry infectious particles a half mile or more, making identification of exposure difficult in some cases. Transmission can also occur through direct contact with contaminated material or through ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. The infectious dose is very low and a single organism may lead to infection. Of those exposed, 60% may be asymptomatic. Surveillance is also important because Q Fever has the potential for use as a bioterrorism agent.154Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Rabies, Animal Disease Abstract Rabies, Human: From 2001 through 2010, there was one human rabies case in Florida. That infection occurred when an adult male was bitten by a dog in Haiti in 2004 and became ill after returning to Florida. A canine variant strain of rabies then circulating in Haiti was isolated from the patient. There were no human cases identified in 2010, although testing was performed on two Florida residents and one resident of the Philippines. Two suspect cases related to the Haiti earthquake response were also investigated but rabies was ruled out. Please refer to the Rabies, Possible Exposure summary in this same section for further details. Rabies, Animal: There were a total of 130 rabid animals reported in 2010, but only 128 of those positive results were tested in 2010. This report will describe data based on date tested. Rabies is endemic in the raccoon and bat populations of Florida, and frequently spills over from raccoons and occasionally from bats into other animal species such as foxes and cats. Laboratory testing for animal rabies is only done when animals expose humans or domestic animals, thus these data do not necessarily correlate with the true prevalence of rabies by animal species in Florida. Among the 2,747 animals tested at the Bureau of Laboratories (BOL) in 2010 there were 128 confirmed rabid animals. This represents a 20.5% decrease in rabid animals from the previous five-year average. There was also an 8.5% decrease in the number of total animals tested for rabies. The decrease may be in part due to decreasing state and local budgets resulting in fewer resources available to pursue animal testing, as well as strict enforcement of a policy limiting testing to wild animals or instances where exposure of humans or pets has occurred prior to animal testing. Fee-based testing through the Kansas State University (KSU) Rabies Laboratory is available for those jurisdictions with funds available to pay for animal testing not associated with a human exposure. One of ten animals submitted to KSU Rabies Laboratory was positive for rabies. The rabies positive animal was a raccoon submitted from Wakulla County following increased reports of suspected rabies activity in wildlife. In 2010, rabid animals were found in 42 of 67 counties in Florida, with the highest activity concentrated in the north and central parts of the state. Alachua County reported the most cases with 10 animals testing positive for rabies; Duval, Jackson, and Orange Counties all had eight animal rabies cases (see map). Animals testing positive for rabies were identified in each month of the year with most activity in summer: July (19) and August (16), followed by a smaller winter-spring peak: February (12), March (12), and April (13). The highest numbers of raccoons testing positive for rabies were identified in July (10), January (9), and February (9). June and July had the most foxes testing positive for rabies, with three each. Six (40%) of 15 rabid bats were identified in August. Four (27%) of 15 rabid cats were identified in December.birthing fluids and may be shed in milk.

Transmission can also occur through direct contact with contaminated material or through ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. The infectious dose is very low and a single organism may lead to infection. Of those exposed, 60% may be asymptomatic. Coxiella burnetii is a CDC Select Agent and a Class B bioterrorism agent.

The decrease may be in part due to decreasing state and local budgets resulting in fewer resources available to pursue animal testing as well as strict enforcement of the policy that a human exposure has occurred (such as a bite or scratch from a potentially infected animal) prior to animal testing. Fee based testing through the Kansas State University (KSU) Rabies Laboratory is available for those jurisdictions with funds available to pay for animal testing not associated with a human exposure. One of ten animals submitted to KSU Rabies Laboratory was positive for rabies.

Alachua County reported the most cases with10 animals testing positive for rabies; Duval, Jackson and Orange Counties all had eight animal rabies cases (see map). Animals testing 155Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Raccoons accounted for the majority of rabid animals in 2010 (75 cases, 59%); rabies was identified in 15 animals (12%) each for bats, foxes, and cats. For the first time since 1997, cats moved from the 4th most com - mon species identified with rabies to second, tied with bats and foxes. Feline rabies was above the 20 year average, while rabies in raccoons, bats, and foxes was below their respective 20 year averages. This may represent increased rabies activity in cats or increased likelihood of human and domestic animal contact with rabid cats compared to rabid wildlife. Since 1997, rabid cats have continued to outnumber rabid dogs although rabies vaccination is compulsory for both. All rabid cats tested in 2010 were either not vaccinated against rabies or had unknown rabies vaccination history. All positive cats were feral (12) or pets (3) allowed to roam outdoors. No dogs were found to be rabid in 2010, although over 600 were tested. One horse from Marion County was found to be rabid and resulted in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis being recommended for 1 1 people in Marion and Alachua counties. In addition, four bobcats and three otters were positive for rabies. An exhaustive search for several children seen playing with a rabid bat at a local pier was conducted by the Lee County Health Department. An Epi-X alert distributed nationwide resulted in an out-of-state visitor submitting a photo of the children to their local health department, followed by successful identification and prophylaxis of five children in Lee County. A similar situation with a rabid bat at a convenience store in Okeechobee County resulted in successful identification of three children following queries from the county health department to the local school. Molecular sequencing of select positive samples by KSU Rabies Laboratory confirmed 12 terrestrial animals (one raccoon, three cats, two gray fox, three bobcats, two otters, and one horse) were infected with the eastern U.S. raccoon rabies variant. Bat samples submitted for variant typing are pending. Animals Testing Positive for Rabies by County, Florida, 2010 Prevention During 2009, the Florida Rabies Advisory Committee revised the rabies guidebook to provide information for county health departments and others involved in rabies control and prevention. Use preventive measures that include the following strategies. Vaccinate pets and at-risk livestock. 156Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Prevention The Florida Department of Health Rabies Prevention and Control in Florida, 2011 contains information for county health departments and others involved in rabies control and prevention. Use preventive measures that include the following strategies. V accinate pets and at-risk livestock. A void direct human and domestic animal contact with wild animals. Educate the public to reduce contact with stray and feral animals. Support animal control in ef forts to reduce feral and stray animal populations. Bat-proof homes. Provide pre-exposure prophylaxis for people in high-risk professions, such as animal control and veterinary personnel, laboratory workers, and those working with wildlife. Consider pre-exposure prophylaxis for those traveling extensively where rabies is common in domestic animals. Oral bait vaccination programs for wildlife are justified in some situations. These programs can be effective but require careful advance planning and substantial time and financial commitments.

Rabies PEP is recommended when an individual is bitten, scratched, or has mucous membrane or fresh wound contact with the saliva or nervous tissue of a laboratory-confirmed rabid animal, or a suspected rabid animal that is not available for testing. The annual incidence of exposures for which PEP is recommended has increased since case reporting was ini - tiated (Figure 1). In 2010, the incidence rate was up 41.33% over the previous five-year average although the number of confirmed rabid animals decreased in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase in PEP may be due to improved reporting, increased exposures to possible rabid animals, increased inappropriate or unnecessary use of PEP, or a combination of factors. Reductions in state and local resources may contribute to increases in inappropriate or unnecessary use of PEP by decreasing resources to investigate animal exposures and confirm animal health status, and by reducing county health department staf f time to provide regular rabies PEP education for health care providers.

Rabies, Possible Exposure Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 PEP is recommended year round in Florida, though the number of treatment incidents increases somewhat from May to July (Figure 2). The average age of the victim for the 2,114 cases reported in 2010 was 37 years, with a range from under one year to 110 years of age. The highest incidence was seen in individuals aged between 20 and 24 years, but incidence was similar for ages 15 to 19 and 45 to 54 years (Figure 3). There were some variations in age based on the type of animal involved. A verage age for those recommended to receive PEP who were exposed to dogs was 32 years; cats, 41 years; and wildlife, 43 years. Men and women were equally represented for PEP when assessing overall exposures and wildlife exposures. However, more men (56%) were recommended to receive PEP for dog exposures, while women (67%) were over-represented in relation to cat exposures. Most persons who were recommended to receive PEP were white (76%), with only 7% of cases representing blacks. Most cases were non-Hispanic (73%), although 14% were Hispanic. Of the 2,114 cases reported in 2010, the largest proportion of exposed persons for whom treatment was recommended reported exposure to dogs (n=850, 46%). Other animals to which people were exposed include cats (n= 445, 24%), raccoons (n=241, 13%), and bats (n=144, 7%). Less numerous exposures included contact with foxes (16), horses (14), otters (12), squirrels (8), bobcats (5), non-human primates (4), opossums (3), ferrets (3), skunks (2), rats (2), a pig, a cougar, a cow, and other exotic animal species. Though horse exposures are generally low risk, the cases in 2010 were primarily due to exposure of rabies-positive animals. However, squirrels, rats, opossums, owned ferrets, and cattle are also generally low risk species for rabies, and there were no cases of rabies reported in these species. Most 2010 PEP cases involved exposure to stray (42%) or wild (23%) animals. Types of exposure were primarily bites (80%). Scratches were reported in 9% of cases, unknown 6%, other in 4% of cases, saliva in open wound (1.6%), handling (1.4%), bat in the room (1.3%), and saliva on a mucous membrane (<1%) were also reported. Face bites were reported in 99 cases (5%) and typically involved children, average case age was 17 years. T wenty percent of the animals involved in exposures were reported to be owned, 76% of these animals were dogs. Reasons for recommending PEP in cases involving owned animals included face bites, gun shot to the animal's head, and captive wildlife that disappeared. In addition, PEP was inappropriately recommended in some of these cases. Rabies PEP treatment was only known to be initiated 70% of the time; reasons for PEP not being initiated included patient refusal or inappropriate treatment recommendation by the health care Previous 5 year average 2010Figure 3.

Though horse exposures are generally low risk, the cases in 2010 were primarily due to exposure of rabies positive animals. However squirrels, rats, opossums, owned ferrets, and cattle are also generally low risk species for rabies, and there were no cases of rabies reported in these species. Most 2010 PEP cases involved exposure to stray (42%) or wild (23%) animals. Types of exposure were primarily bites (80%). Scratches were reported in 9% of cases, unknown 6%, other in 4% of cases, saliva in open wound (1.6%), handling (1.4%), bat in the room (1.3%) and saliva on a mucous membrane (<1%) were also reported. Face bites were reported in 99 cases (5%) and typically involved children, average case age was 17 years. Twenty percent of the animals involved in exposures were reported to be owned, 76% of these animals were dogs. Reasons for recommending PEP in cases involving owned animals included face bites, gun shot to the animal's head, and captive wildlife that disappeared. In addition, PEP was inappropriately recommended in some of these cases. Rabies PEP treatment was only known to be initiated 70% of the time; reasons for PEP not being initiated included patient refusal or inappropriate treatment recommendation by the health care provider.

Florida is in the process of revising state case definitions to align with updated SFR national reporting criteria. Although only RMSF was reportable in 2010, notifications regarding infections with other SFR agents sent to FDOH in 2010 occurred and will also be described in this report. Antibodies for other spotted fever rickettsial species, such as Rickettsia parkeri, R. for the RMSF agent R. rickettsii, and commercial testing to differentiate other SFR from RMSF is currently limited. This may explain, in part, appar - ent changes in RMSF incidence and geographic distribution. Clinically , the presence of eschar type lesions at the site of the tick bite is suggestive of infection from a SFR other than R. rickettsii. In 2010, there were 13 cases of RMSF reported (Figure 1). However , one case of SFR from R. africae infec- tion was reported as a RMSF case in the Merlin reportable disease surveillance system, which brings the total listed under RMSF in Merlin to 14. All 14 cases, (four confirmed and ten probable) had positive serology for RMSF at commercial labs, although there were four infections with eschar lesions indicating an SFR other than RMSF. Two of the four infections with eschar lesions were able to have additional testing performed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In one case, CDC positive serology results identified both R. rickettsii and R. parkeri. The fourth case with an eschar and commercial laboratory results for R. rickettsii was confirmed to be R. africae by CDC. This infection was in a woman aged 44 years from Miami-Dade County with travel to South Africa. In addition to the 13 RMSF cases and R. africae infection, there was also an SFR case reported in a woman aged 53 years from Pinellas County with travel to South Africa. The woman presented with an eschar lesion and the causative agent was confirmed by the CDC to be R. conorii. The extent that ecological factors such as rainfall, ambient temperature, fluctuations in tick host densities, and other factors have on incidence of disease in humans in Florida is unknown. In Florida, cases of RMSF are reported year-round, though peak transmission typically occurs during the summer months (Figure 2). In 2010, more cases were reported in April and May than usual, which likely reflects favorable conditions due to one or more of the environmental variables listed above. Of the 2010 cases, nine (64%) acquired the disease in Florida, four (29%) acquired the disease in another U.S. state, and one was acquired in South Africa (R. africae case).

Methods for preventing tick bites include: W ear light-colored clothing so that ticks crawling on clothing are visible. T uck pants legs into socks so that ticks cannot crawl inside clothing. Apply repellent to discourage tick attachment. Repellents containing permethrin can be sprayed on boots and clothing, and will last for several days. Repellents containing DEET can be applied to the skin, but will last only a few hours before reapplication is necessary . Search the body for ticks frequently when spending time in potentially tick-infested areas. If a tick is found, it should be removed as soon as possible. o Using fine tweezers or a tissue to protect fingers, grasp the tick close to the skin and gently pull straight out without twisting. o Do not use bare fingers to crush ticks. o W ash your hands following tick removal. Control tick populations in the yard and on pets to reduce the risk of disease transmission.The American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis , is the principal RMSF vector in Florida; the primary vector for R. parkeri is the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum ; and the primary vector for R. amblyomma is believed to be the Lone Star tick, Amblyomma americanum.

Salmonellosis Disease Abstract Salmonellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by infection with bacteria of the genus Salmonella . This category does not include typhoid fever. The incidence rate for salmonellosis has increased over the last ten years (Figure 1). In 2010, the incidence was 33.43 cases per 100,000 population, an increase from the previous peak in 2005 of 12.65 cases per 100,000 population. In 2010, 6,282 cases were reported, with 95.3% con - firmed. The number of cases reported increases every year in the summer and early fall. In 2010, the number of cases exceeded the previous five-year average in all months except May (Figure 2). Data published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) indicate that Florida reported more cases of salmonellosis in 2010 than any other state. Overall, 7.8% of salmonellosis cases were classified as outbreak-related in 2010. Figure 2.

The incidence rate for shigellosis has varied over the last ten years (Figure 1). Periodic community outbreaks involving childcare centers account for most of the observed variability. In 2010, daycare attendees accounted for 26.3% of all cases, compared to 17.8% in 2009. This number does not take into account cases infected by an initial day - care-associated case. Although in 2010 there was a 7.6% decrease in comparison to the average incidence from 2005 to 2009, more than twice as many cases were reported in 2010 compared to 2009 (461). Only 80.0% of cases were confirmed in 2010, compared to 92.2% confirmed in 2009, which indicates increased outbreak activity. Overall, 28.6% of shigellosis cases were classified as outbreak-associated. Historically, the number of cases does not show a distinct seasonal pattern, but instead varies between years. In 2010, the number of cases increased steadily from January to August, and remained high through the end of the year (Figure 2).

Incidence rates were similar among females and males (6.5 and 6.4 per 100,000 respectively). Shigellosis was reported in 48 of 67 counties in Florida. Cases were concentrated in the southeastern, central western, and northeastern part of the state. Figure 2. Shigellosis Cases by Month of Exposure, Florida, 2010 Figure 3.

A case, for reporting purposes, is defined by a culture obtained from a normally sterile site, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, that is either intermediate resistant or fully resistant to one or more commonly used antibiotics. The annual incidence rate for DRSP peaked in 2000 and gradually declined until 2005 when it increased again and is now relatively consistent at around four cases per 100,000 population per year (Figure 1). The majority of cases occur during the winter months. In 2010, this seasonal peak was more pronounced, although the overall rate was only slightly elevated from previous years (Figure 2). Figure 2. Streptococcus pneumoniae , Invasive Disease, Drug-Resistant Cases by Month of Exposure, Florida, 2010 Incidence rates are highest among infants aged less than one year , children aged one to four years, and those aged 85 and over.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Invasive Disease, Drug-Resistant Cases and Incidence Rate* by County, Florida, 2010 Prevention The most effective way of preventing pneumococcal infections, including DRSP infections, is through vaccina - tion. Currently, there are two vaccines available. A conjugate vaccine is recommended for all children through age five, with vaccination beginning in the first year of life. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be administered routinely to all adults >65 years. The vaccine is also indicated for children aged six through eighteen with certain underlying medical conditions. Additionally, it is important to practice good hand hygiene, to take antibiotics only when necessary, and to finish the entire course of any prescribed treatment.

Syphilis infection, when left untreated, may progress through several stages over time: primary , secondary , early latent, late latent, and potentially, to neurosyphilis. Transmission of syphilis can occur during vaginal, anal, and oral sex. During pregnancy, the organism can infect a fetus in utero or at delivery. In 2010, there were 4,071 syphilis cases reported in Florida, of those cases, 19 were reported as congenital cases. This report will focus on the earlier stages of syphilis. Total early (primary, secondary, early latent) syphilis includes all cases where initial infection has occurred within the previous 12 months. In 2010, there were 2,479 early syphilis cases reported in Florida, an increase of 183 cases from 2009 (2,296) and 1,185 primary and secondary syphilis cases. Of the total cases reported, 61% of cases were diagnosed as primary , second- ary, or early latent infections with a case rate of 13.2 per 100,000. Of the 2,479 early syphilis cases reported in 2010, 81% were reported from seven counties (Table 1); these same counties also had the greatest number of infections the previous year. Table 1. Reported Cases of Total Early Syphilis by County for the Seven Most Frequent Counties, Florida, 2010 More than other reportable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), syphilis is highly clustered geographically , mostly occurring in several southern counties and distinct urban areas throughout Florida. T welve counties reported no cases of early syphilis and forty counties reported five or fewer cases of early syphilis. One important subset of total early syphilis cases is infectious syphilis (primary and secondary stages). In 2010, infectious syphilis cases totaled 1,185 or 48% of total early syphilis. Of these cases, 88% were in men and 70% were in men who have sex with men (MSM). The ratio of male to female early syphilis cases was 5 to 1 overall, but differed among racial and ethnic groups. The male to female ratio among non-Hispanic blacks was 3 to 1, non-Hispanic whites 9 to 1, and Hispanics 10 to 1. The proportional gender dif ferences between racial/ethnic groups indicated that early syphilis cases in non-Hispanic black populations were more evenly distributed between men and women. The overall male to female ratio for infectious syphilis was 10 to 1.Table 1.

Persons who self-reported as non-Hispanic black accounted for 39.2% of the early syphilis cases in 2010. However, this same group only accounts for 15% of the state's population. Persons who self reported as non-Hispanic white accounted for 31.9% of the cases. Persons who self-report - ed as Hispanic (white, black, or other) accounted for 25.4% of the cases. Persons who self-reported in other or unidentified racial and ethnic groups accounted for 1.4% of the cases. The rate for non-Hispanic blacks was 34.1 per 100,000 population. This rate was nearly twice as high as the second highest rate, in Hispanics (17.9 per 100,000 population), and four times greater than non-Hispanic whites (7.8 per 100,000 population). Table 2. Reported Cases of Total Early Syphilis by Race and Ethnicity, by Gender and Sexual Preference, Florida, 2010Total Syphilis Cases by County, Florida, 2010 In 2010, the distribution of early syphilis by race and ethnicity indicated that the disease disproportionately affected non-Hispanic blacks.

Sixty-three percent of cases in females were reported in women younger than 30 years of age, compared to 34% in males of the same age cohort. Despite elimination efforts, syphilis in recent years has been persistent in the MSM population. The distribution of early syphilis in this group differs in age, race, and ethnicity from heterosexual populations. Men who self indentified as MSM accounted for 67% of the total early syphilis cases. Unlike in the heterosexual population, non-Hispanic white men (38%) and Hispanic men (31%) accounted for slightly greater percentages of the reported MSM cases than non-Hispanic black men (29%) did. The similar morbidity numbers across racial and ethnic groups is likely an indication of similar risk behavior trends in this population, regardless of race and ethnicity. Age also appears not to be a key predictor of infection as the morbidity is distributed relatively evenly. However, 61% of early syphilis infections in non-Hispanic blacks occurred in those under 30 years of age while the greatest number of infections in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics occurred in older men.

Fifty-nine percent of MSM with early syphilis infections were also co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency V irus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, a vast difference from the 9.8% of co-infected heterosexual men and 8.4% of co-infected women. Prevention According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the surest way to avoid transmission of any STD is to abstain from sexual contact, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected. When used consistently and correctly , a latex condom can reduce the risk of transmission of syphilis. At the onset of a syphilis infection, the first symptom can last for 3 to 6 weeks and is usually a small, round, painless sore on the area of exposure (genitals, anus, or mouth). A rash may appear on the body after or while the sore is healing. The rash will typically occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Without treatment, these symptoms can subside but the infection will remain present in the body. Other signs and symptoms include patchy hair loss, weight loss, fatigue, muscle soreness, and headaches. Women and men who are told they have a syphilis infection and are treated for it should notify all of their recent sex partners (sex partners within the preceding 60 days) so they can see a health care provider and be evaluated for any possible STD exposure. Sexual activity should not resume until all sex partners have been examined and, if necessary, treated.other or unidentified racial and ethnic groups accounted for 1.4% of the cases. The rate for non-Hispanic blacks was 34.1 per 100,000 population. This rate was nearly twice as high as the second highest rate, in Hispanics (17.9 per 100,000 population), and four times greater than non-Hispanic whites (7.8 per 100,000 population). Female Non-MSM MSM Total Black/African American (Non-Hispanic) 253 247 473 973 White Non-Hispanic 79 89 623 791 Hispanic 57 67 505 629 Other 7 9 19 35 Unknown 7 15 29 51 Total 403 427 1,649 2,479 The greatest proportion of early syphilis cases for females were reported in the 20-24 and 25-29 age groups; whereas male cases did not show as much difference between age groups (Table 3). Sixty-three percent of cases in females were reported in women younger than 30 years of age, compared to 34% in males of the same age cohort. Despite elimination efforts, syphilis in recent years has been persistent in the MSM population. The distribution of early syphilis in this group differs in age, race, and ethnicity from heterosexual populations. Men who self indentified as MSM accounted for 67% of the total early syphilis cases. Unlike in the heterosexual population, non-Hispanic white men (38%) and Hispanic men (31%) accounted for slightly greater percentages of the reported MSM cases than non-Hispanic black men (29%) did. The similar morbidity numbers across racial and ethnic groups is likely an indication of similar risk behavior trends in this population, regardless of race and ethnicity. Age also appears not to be a key predictor of infection as the morbidity is distributed relatively evenly. However, 61% of early syphilis infections in non-Hispanic blacks occurred in those under 30 years of age while the greatest number of infections in non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics occurred in older men.

Transmission of an STD, including syphilis cannot be prevented by washing the genitals, urinating, or douching after sex. Any unusual discharge, sore, or rash, particularly in the groin area, should be a signal to refrain from having sex and to see a doctor immediately .

Tuberculosis Disease AbstractTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease, mostly respiratory, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This disease is spread by aerosolized droplets from people with active TB. Each year there are over nine million infections and 1.7 million deaths caused by the disease worldwide. Only 10% of healthy individuals infected with TB bacteria will ever get the active form of the disease. However, this risk increases dramatically with specific risk factors and co-morbid conditions. In 2010, 821 tuberculosis cases were reported in Florida (Figure 1). This represents a 1.6% increase in cases since 2009 (822). The TB case rate remained the same at 4.4 per 100,000 population in 2009 and in 2010 (Figure 2). Figure 1. Tuberculosis Cases by Year, Florida, 1994-2010 Figure 1.

Population estimates from Florida CHARTS The risk factors associated with having TB disease from 1994-2010 were: excess alcohol use (within a year of TB diagnosis), drug use (within a year of TB diagnosis), homelessness (within a year of TB diagnosis), and HIV co-infection. In 2010, there were 122 cases where excess alcohol use was a risk factor. Drug use was Figure 5. Tuberculosis Cases by Age Group, Florida, 2010 Figure 6.

In 2010, there were 122 cases where excess alcohol use was a risk factor . Drug use was reported in 82 cases, homelessness in 52 cases, and HIV co-infection was reported in 103 cases. Please note: multiple risk factors can be reported for a case and not all cases will have these risk factors (Figure 7). Figure 7. Tuberculosis Cases with Selected Risk Factors, Florida, 2010 Effective TB prevention and control within correctional settings are essential elements to protecting the health of inmates, staff, and the community. However, responsibility for care must be transferred to the county health department in order to ensure adherence to treatment once inmates are released back into the community with active TB disease or infection. Failure to complete treatment could lead to acquiring multi-drug resistance to TB medications, developing active TB disease, or exposing the general community to possible TB infection. There were 26 TB cases in people residing in correctional facilities in 2010. Fifty percent of the cases were from state prisons, 23% were from local jails, 23% were from federal prisons, and the remaining 4% came from other detainment facilities (Figure 8).7Figure 5.

The number of confirmed cases of typhoid fever for the last 10 years has ranged from 10 to 22 annually . In 2010, 22 cases were reported, representing an annual incidence rate of 0.1 per 100,000. This was a 39.2% increase from the average annual number of reported cases in the previous five years (Figure 1). One 2010 case was classified as probable, the remaining 21 cases as confirmed. The median age was 23.5. Over the past five years, and consistent with national data, the majority of Florida cases (66-95%) were acquired outside the U.S. In 2010, the majority of Florida cases were imported from India (55%) and Haiti (32%). The counties reporting the greatest number of cases were Broward, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Manatee. Cases typically occur more frequently in the summer months, with a September peak in 2010. Cases tend to be isolated, rather than clustered. However , three of the four cases that occurred in September of 2010 were in students attending a soccer academy in India during monsoon season, which created flooding and unsanitary conditions. In 2010, seven cases were imported from Haiti, compared to only three cases in 2009. This higher number may be due to increased travel between Haiti and Florida following a large earthquake on January 12, 2010. Figure 2.

This includes the use of the following methods. Wash your hands thoroughly. Dispose of human waste products appropriately. Maintain safe and purified water supplies. Control insects. Use appropriate refrigeration. Maintain cleanliness when preparing food in both home and commercial settings. Make sure cases are treated promptly and effectively. Assure that people with untreated cases do not expose others, for example as food-handlers. In endemic areas, prevention measures should include drinking bottled or carbonated water, cooking foods thoroughly, peeling raw fruits and vegetables, and in general, avoiding food or drink from street vendors. Immunization is recommended only for those with occupational exposure to enteric infections or for those traveling or living in endemic, high-risk areas. References David L.

Due to the occurrence of disease after one dose of vaccine, the current recommendation is for two doses of vaccine. Proof of varicella vaccination or healthcare provider documenta - tion of disease is required for entry and attendance in childcare facilities, family daycare homes, and schools for certain grades. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends varicella vaccine for susceptible persons following exposure to a case of varicella infection. If administered within 72 hours, and possibly up to 120 hours following varicella exposure, varicella vaccine may prevent or significantly modify the disease. Post-exposure vaccine use should be considered following exposures in healthcare settings, where transmis - sion risk should be minimized at all times, and in households. If exposure to varicella does not cause infection, post-exposure vaccination with varicella vaccine should induce protection against subsequent infection. If exposure results in infection, the vaccine may reduce the severity of the disease. Varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG or VariZIG) is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis of suscep - tible persons who are at high risk for developing severe disease when varicella vaccine is contraindicated. VZIG is most effective in preventing varicella infection when given within 96 hours of exposure. An investiga - tional (not licensed) product, VariZIG, became available in February 2006 under an investigational new drug (IND) application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration after the only U.S. licensed manufacturer of VZIG announced it had discontinued production.

Transmission occurs primarily through the foodborne route, and in Florida infection with Vibrio occurs principally from eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Transmission can also occur through contact of broken skin with seawater where Vibrio species are endemic, which includes the coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the infecting Vibrio species. The species of greatest public health concern in Florida are V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus .

Vibriosis Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida, 2010 Vibrio vulnificus infections Vibrio vulnificus infections typically manifest as septicemia in persons who have chronic liver disease, chronic alcoholism, or are immuno-compromised. V. vulnificus infections can lead to severe outcomes including death. V. vulnificus infections are commonly associated with the consumption of raw oysters, although the bacteria can also infect wounds exposed to coastal or marine waters or raw seafood juices. Of the vibriosis cases reported in 2010, 32 were determined to be V. vulnificus. Of the 32 reported V. vulnificus cases, 19 were wound infections (one death) and eight were attributed to oyster consumption (four deaths). Exposure was unknown in five of the cases (four deaths). Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections typically manifest as gastrointestinal disorders with symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. It is commonly associated with the consumption of raw oysters and is also associated with the consumption of cross-contaminated crustacean shellfish (crab, shrimp, and lobster). V. parahaemolyticus can also cause wound infections when broken skin is exposed to seawater where V. parahaemolyticus is endemic. Of the vibriosis cases reported in 2010, 37 were V. parahaemolyticus . Of these 37 cases, 12 were wound infections, seven were attributed to oyster consumption, and exposure was unknown in eight of the cases. No deaths from V. parahaemolyticus infection were reported.that is likely to have chronic conditions that predispose them to these infections. However, in 2010, there was a relatively high incidence rate among those 5 to 19 years old. Vibrio cases were reported in 34 of the 67 counties in Florida in 2010. The higher-incidence counties are found along the coasts. Vibriosis Cases and Incidence Rates* by County, Florida, 2010 195Section 2: Selected Notifiable Diseases and Conditions Vibrio alginolyticus infections Vibrio alginolyticus infections typically present as self-limited wound infections and ear infections. Septicemia and death have been reported in immunocompromised individuals and burn patients. Infection is commonly associated with exposure to seawater. Of the vibriosis cases reported in 2010, 38 were V. alginolyticus. Of these 38 cases, 23 were wound infections and 11 were reported ear infections. No deaths from V. alginolyticus were reported. Vibrio cholerae , non-O1 infections During the 2010 calendar year there were a total of five Vibrio cholerae infections due to non-O1 and non- O139 strains reported in different counties across Florida. Case interviews revealed that four of the cases had their exposure in Florida and three were associated with raw or steamed oyster consumption. One of those cases, a boy aged 12 years, was confirmed to have Vibrio cholerae O75 five days after consuming raw oysters in October. The child recovered after being hospitalized for two days. Strain O75 has become an emerging concern due to its production of cholera toxin, which is not typical for non-O1 strains.

It remained stable and near zero from 2006 until 2010, (Figure 1). In 2010, there were twelve locally-acquired human cases, nine confirmed and three probable. Nine cases were classified as neuroinvasive disease and three as fever (not neuroinvasive). One laboratory positive asymptomatic blood donor was also reported in Brevard County . Ages of cases in 2010 ranged from 7 to 82 years, with a median age of 49 years. Although three cases in 2010 involved persons aged <20 years, most cases (75%) were those aged 35 years and older as typically seen in the past (Figure 3). Two cases involving men aged 80 and 82 years were fatal. Nine (75%) of the cases were male and three (25%) female. Race was primarily white and non-Hispanic with 83% of cases being white, 8% black, 8% other, and 92% non-Hispanic compared with 8% Hispanic. In 2010, activity was reported from July to October with activity peaking in July (2), August (4), September (3), and October (3). This is slightly later than WNV activity seen in the past five years, but is more typical of temporal distributions seen during earlier epidemic years (Figure 2 and 2006 Florida Statistics Morbidity Report). Nine of the cases reported no or rare use of mosquito repellant and three reported using repellant sometimes. Five of the 12 were smokers, most of who were known to have smoked outside. One case did not have window screens, and four cases had underlying medical conditions, including the two fatal cases. The level of virus transmission between bird and mosquito populations is dependent on a number of envi - ronmental factors. Drought conditions that persisted from 2006 to 2009 across most of the state may have contributed to the previous decrease in cases. Population immunity may also play a role. W est Nile virus transmission tends to be localized from year-to-year in Florida. In 2001, the epicenter of the WNV outbreak was in the north-central part of the state. The following year, activity was most intense in the northwestern and central counties. The focus in 2003 was the panhandle, while south Florida had the most activity in 2004. In 2005, 86% of the human cases were in Pinellas County. Most exposures in 2010 occurred in counties located in the central and south part of the state. Cases were reported in Osceola, Orange (2), Collier (2), Broward, Duval, De Soto, Lee, Suwannee (exposure believed to be in south Florida), Brevard, and Highlands counties.

West Nile Virus Disease Incidence Rate by Age Group, Florida, 2010 In general, approximately 80% of those infected show no clinical symptoms. T wenty percent have mild symptoms, and less than 1% experiences the most severe neuro-invasive form of illness. People over the age of 50 years seem to be at increased risk for neuroinvasive disease and more severe outcomes. In Florida, case-fatality ratios range from 4% for all cases to 7% among those who develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, although the fatality rate for neuroinvasive disease was 22% in 2010. Interestingly , activity of a related virus, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, has decreased dramatically since WNV was first detected in the state in 2001. Research suggests that in wild bird species that may act as reservoirs, antibodies for WNV may protect against SLE virus infection. Prevention There is no specific treatment for WNV disease, and therapy is supportive for ill people; prevention is a neces - sity.

Twenty percent have mild symptoms, and less than 1% experiences the most severe neuro-invasive form of illness. People over the age of 50 seem to be at increased risk for neuroinvasive disease and more severe outcomes. In Florida, case- fatality ratios range from 4% for all cases to 7% among those who develop the neuroinvasive form of the disease, although the fatality rate for neuroinvasive disease was 22% in 2010. Interestingly, activity of a related disease, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), has decreased dramatically since WNV was first detected in the state in 2001. Research suggests that in wild bird species that may act as reservoirs, antibodies for WNV may protect against SLE virus infection. Prevention There is no specific treatment for WNV disease, and therapy is supportive for ill people; prevention is a necessity.

Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used. Empty and clean birdbaths and pet' s water bowls at least once or twice a week. Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water . Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use. COVER skin with clothing or repellent: CLOTHING - W ear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present. REPELLENT - Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET , picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective. Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old. COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house: Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

Section 3 Foodborne Disease Outbreaks202Section 3: Foodborne Disease Outbreaks Description Foodborne disease investigation and surveillance are essential public health activities. Globalization of the food supply, changes in eating habits and behaviors, and newly emerging pathogens have impacted the risk of contracting foodborne diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates foodborne diseases from unspecified agents account for approximately 38.4 million illnesses, 71,878 hospitalizations, and 1,686 deaths per year in the U.S. An additional estimated 9.4 million illnesses, 55,961 hospitalizations, and 1,351 deaths are accounted for by confirmed foodborne pathogens. Florida has had a unique program in place since 1994 to oversee food and waterborne disease surveillance and investigation for the state with the intent to better capture and investigate food and waterborne diseases, complaints and outbreaks, as well as to increase knowledge and prevent illness with regard to this important public health issue. Foodborne disease outbreaks, as defined by the Florida Department of Health' s Food and W aterborne Disease Program, are incidents in which two or more people have the same disease, have similar symptoms, or excrete the same pathogens; and there is a person, place, and/or time association between these people along with ingestion of a common food. A single case of suspected botulism, mushroom poisoning, ciguatera or paralytic shellfish poisoning, other rare disease, or a case of a disease that can be definitively linked to ingestion of a food, is considered an incident of foodborne illness and warrants further investigation. Overview In 2010, Florida reported 64 foodborne disease outbreaks with 805 associated cases. (T able 1). Table 1 .

Seasonality There was no seasonality trend in reported outbreaks. March had the highest number of outbreaks (N=10) and May the lowest (N=1) (Figure 5). Similarly there was no trend in the number of outbreak related cases reported monthly with the highest number of cases (N=130) reported in November (Figure 6). Figure 1 .

Foodborne disease outbreaks caused by bacterial pathogens also accounted for the most reported cases (51.3%). Pathogen type was unknown for 9.4% of the reported foodborne disease outbreaks accounting for 6.8% of the reported outbreak-related cases (Table 2). Among foodborne disease outbreaks with a suspected and/or confirmed etiology , Norovirus was the most frequently reported etiology for 2010 accounting for 25 (39.1%) outbreaks followed by Salmonella and Vibrio vulnificus , each accounting for 5 (7.8%) outbreaks. Norovirus also accounted for the highest number of confirmed and probable outbreak-related cases with 325 (40.4%) cases followed by Bacillus cereus, which accounted for 158 (15.3%) cases (Table 2).

Contributing Factors The top contributing factors associated with reported foodborne disease outbreaks in Florida for 2010 are displayed in Table 4. There are three categories of contributing factors (contamination factor, proliferation factor, survival factor). Up to three contributing factors per category can be attributed in an outbreak; as such, the reported numbers may not match the actual number of reported outbreaks and cases. Table 4.

However, the continuing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance jeopardizes the utility of antibiotics and threatens public health globally. Resistant pathogens are often associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and increased intensity and duration of treatment. Currently, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) conducts surveillance for antibiotic resistance in five microorganisms. Practitioners, hospitals, and laboratories are required to report cases of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile site, including antibiotic susceptibility testing results; practitioners, hospitals, and laboratories are required to report cases of vancomycin non-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ; laboratories participating in electronic laboratory reporting are required to report all S. aureus isolates from a normally sterile site with antibiotic susceptibility testing results; isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from cases of meningococcal disease are sent to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for additional laboratory testing as part of MeningNet; Neisseria gonorrheoeae isolates from the first 25 men with urethral gonorrhea seen each month in one STD clinic in Miami are forwarded to CDC for susceptibility testing as part of the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP); and all specimens submitted to the FDOH Bureau of Laboratories that test positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are tested for drug susceptibilities. While the requirement for electronic laboratory reporting of S. aureus isolates was implemented in 2008, submitting laboratories and the FDOH are working on technical issues regarding the transfer of those data. However, the FDOH has partnered with a large commercial laboratory to receive antibiotic susceptibility data for all the S. aureus isolates the laboratory tests that are from Florida residents. The laboratory primarily serves outpatient providers. Ideally, each patient presenting with an infection suspected to be caused by any of these organisms would be treated based on resistance testing of their own isolate. As this is not always possible, a cumulative antibiogram can provide useful information for the selection of an empiric therapy for a presumptive diagnosis. The selection of an antibiotic for empiric treatment should not be based solely on the cumulative antibiogram. However, the cumulative antibiogram should be considered in conjunction with factors such as the pharmacology of the antibiotic, its toxicity and the patient' s hypersensitivity , the potential for interaction of the drug with other drugs the patient may be taking, the effectiveness of the patient's defense mechanisms, and the cost of the drug. Cumulative antibiograms are also useful for tracking the antibiotic resistance patterns of clinically important microorganisms and for detecting trends towards antimicrobial resistance. Streptococcus pneumoniae BackgroundDrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP) invasive disease Florida's list of notifiable diseases in mid-1996. Drug-susceptible S. pneumonia (DSSP) invasive disease was added to the list of notifiable diseases mid-1999 to permit the assessment of the proportion of pneumococcal isolates that are drug-resistant, however electronic data capture of resistance testing results was not fully implemented until 2005. When analyzing susceptibility testing results for S. pneumoniae , only one antibiotic susceptibility result per case was included, in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. If there was more than one susceptibility result per case, results were ranked on date of specimen collection (earliest to latest), date of report (latest to earliest), and number of antibiotics tested (most to least) and the top ranking result was selected for inclusion. The decision to include the first result was based on the aim of this report, which is to guide clinicians in the selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy for initial infections. 211Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Not every isolate was tested for resistance to every antibiotic included in this report. When calculating percent susceptibility to an antibiotic, the denominator is the number of cases tested for that particular antibiotic. Susceptibility results are presented for only those antibiotics that are recommended for routine testing and reporting per 2008 CLSI guidelines. CLSI guidelines divide antibiotics into three groups for the purposes of reporting susceptibility testing results. Groups are based on clinical efficacy , prevalence of resistance, minimizing emergence of resistance, cost, FDA clinical indications for usage, and current consensus recommendations for first-choice and alternative drugs. Group A includes antibiotics that CLSI considers appropriate for inclusion in routine, primary testing; Group B includes agents that may warrant primary testing, but which CLSI recommends be reported only selectively; Group C includes agents considered alternative or supplemental antimicrobial agents. Please note that cumulative susceptibility results for antimicrobials in Group B and C may underestimate the actual susceptibility rates in the community if only those isolates resistant to Group A antimicrobials are tested against Group B or C agents. Data TrendsThere were a total of 694 DSSP cases and 816 DRSP cases in 2010. Of the 694 DSSP cases, 11 did not have antibiotic susceptibility data because the patient died and further testing was not done. The aggregate percent susceptibility for Group A agents were all around 60% (see Table 1). Aggregate percent susceptibility among Group B agents were more variable, ranging from greater than 97% susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin) and greater than 99% susceptibility to vancomycin to only 73% susceptibility to tetracycline and 78% susceptibility to clindamycin. Aggregate percent susceptibility for Group C agents were 85% or higher. Table 1. Streptococcus pneumoniae , Invasive Disease, Antibiotic Resistance, Florida 2010 CLSI Group* Antibiotic NameNumber of Isolates TestedSusceptible Intermediate Resistant Group A - primary test & CLSI guidelines split antibiotics into three groups for the purposes of reporting sus ceptibility testing results. Groups are based on clinical efficacy , prevalence of resistance, minimizing emergence of resistance, cost, FDA clinical indications for usage, and current consensus recommendations for first-choice and alternative drugs. Group A includes antibiotics that CLSI considers appropriate for inclusion in routine, primary testing; Group B includes agents that may warrant primary testing, but which CLSI recommends be reported only selectively; Group C includes agents considered alternative or supplemental antimicrobial agents. Please note that cumulative susceptibility results for antimicrobials in Group B and C may underestimate the actual susceptibility rates in the community if only those isolates resistant to Group A antimicrobials are tested against Group B or C agents.212Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance S. pneumoniae susceptibility to most Group A and Group B antibiotics stayed relatively stable from 2005 to 2010 (see Figure 2). Antibiotics with slight increases in susceptibility include penicillin and ofloxacin. Antibiotics with slight decreases in susceptibility include erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline.

For example, only 33% of cases in young children (age d 1-4 years) tested for resistance to erythromycin were susceptible, versus 42% of cases in youth (age d 15-24 years) and over 50% in all other age groups. Only 39% of cases in young children were susceptible to penicillin, versus 47% or higher in all other age groups. And likewise, only 34% of cases in young children were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxozole versus 53% or higher in other age groups.213Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Table 2.

Results of age group/drug combinations where there were fewer than 10 cases tested were suppressed. Resistance patterns were also summarized by Regional Domestic Security Task Force Region. The South West Region tended to have the lowest cumulative susceptibility for the majority of the antimicrobials, while the Northern regions (North east, North Central, Northwest) tended to have the highest cumulative susceptibility (See Table 3).

However , in 2005, the FDOH began receiving antibiotic susceptibility data for all S. aureus isolates tested by a large commercial laboratory that primarily serves outpatient providers operating throughout Florida. Data from 2003 and 2004 were retro - spectively collected and, as of 2010, eight years of data are available. That data is presented here. For the purposes of this analysis, and in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Standards 2008 (CLSI) guidelines, only the first isolate per person per 365 days was included; duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis. S. aureus bacteria are commonly found on the skin of healthy individuals, but have the potential to cause serious disease. About 20% of healthy individuals are persistent carriers of S. aureus, usually in the nose and on the skin, over 60% of the population may be intermittent carriers, and a small portion of people rarely carry S. aureus. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a strain of S. aureus that is considered to be resistant to all -lactam antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamicins, and monobactams). It may also be resistant to other antibiotics. Resistance testing for oxacillin is used to detect methicillin resistance. Healthcare-acquired (HA) infections due to MRSA have been identified for over four decades. In recent years, however, infections due to MRSA have also been increasing in the community in individuals without healthcare-associated risk factors. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most common type of infection resulting from community-associated (CA) S. aureus. While the line between healthcare-associated and community-associated S. aureus has increasingly blurred, they are generally distinct strains of the bacteria with different antibiotic resistance patterns. While HA-MRSA is typically not more virulent or pathogenic than methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), only more difficult to treat, CA-MRSA does have enhanced virulence. It can elicit tissue necrosis, grow faster, and compete more effectively than other strains of S. aureus. It is common for HA-MRSA to have resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents; such wide resistance patterns are uncommon in CA-MRSA. Data Trends After the removal of duplicate isolates for individuals with more than one isolate in a 365 day period, there were 50,996 S. aureus isolates included in the analysis in 2006, 53,131 in 2007, 61,083 in 2008, 63,427 in 2009, and 60,947 in 2010. Resistance to penicillin was above 90% and rose throughout the period. The percentage of all isolates that were methicillin-resistant (as determined by oxacillin resistance) was 50-52% for the entire period. Resistance to other -lactam drugs mirrored oxacillin resistance, remaining stable above 50% for the entire period. Resistance remained low for gentamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, vancomycin and tetracycline. While in vitro resistance to clindamycin was only 15-21%, resistance to erythromycin was substantially higher (65%-68%), indicating the potential for inducible clindamycin resistance and subsequent treatment failure. 215Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Table 4. Number Tested and Percent of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates from a Commercial Laboratory Susceptible to Select Antibiotics, Florida, 2006-2010 Antibiotic Class Antibiotic Name2006 2007 the total number of isolates tested for susceptibility to the selected antibiotic ** % is the percent of isolates susceptible to the selected antibioticVancomycin non-susceptible isolates are likely false-positives. There were only 2 laboratory confirmed vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus cases (VISA) reported to the FDOH in 2010. The commercial laboratory that supplied the data for this analysis used the VITEK system to determine resistance patterns, a test method which has been noted for the occurrence of false-positive test results for vancomycin resistance. It is protocol that isolates that are initially non-susceptible to vancomycin should be retested using manual methods, but unfortunately , final results of that testing are not always included in the data. While there are several vancomycin non-susceptible isolates included in this data, to date, there have been no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) infections reported to the FDOH and only 12 laboratory confirmed VISA infections reported since 2007. There was one VISA case reported in 2007, 3 in 2008, 6 in 2009, and 2 in 2010. The case definition for VISA was changed during that period, lowering the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The increase in reported VISA from 2007 to 2010 is thus partly attributable to a reporting artifact and not reflective of the true magnitude of any increase in VISA that may have occurred. Of the nearly 61,000 isolates tested in 2010, 95.1% (n=58,005) were tested for susceptibility to oxacillin. Of those, just over half (50.8%) had intermediate or full resistance to oxacillin, indicating that they are MRSA and therefore resistant to all -lactam antibiotics. Additionally, as in previous years, resistance was elevated to antibiotics belonging to the fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), lincosamide (clindamycin), and macrolide (erythromycin) classes. Tested organisms remained highly susceptible to drugs from the amino - glycoside (gentamicin), (tetracycline) classes. The proportion of S. aureus isolates resistant to various antibiotics did not differ substantially by age group, with a few exceptions. Isolates taken from individuals age d 1 to 4 years had the highest level of resistance to oxacillin, causing them to be classified as MRSA and indicating resistance to all -lactam antibiotics. Additionally, isolates taken from older individuals had greater resistance to gentamicin (6.1% versus 2.6% versus 17.6%). Resistance was also higher in isolates taken from older patients for tetracycline and erythromycin (with the exception of high levels of resistance seen in those aged 1 to 4 years), although the difference was not as substantial (Figure 2).216Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Figure 2. Resistance Patterns of Staphylococcus aureus Isolates Tested by a Commercial Laboratory by Age Group, Florida, 2010 Of the 54,192 isolates in 2010 where the patient's address could be assigned to a Florida county, the majority were from individuals who lived in the South east Region of the state (n=16,077, 29.7%). Nearly all of the isolates that could be mapped were tested for susceptibility to oxacillin (n=51,597, 95.2%). The Northern part of the state had the highest proportion of S. aureus isolates that were MRSA (61.1% in the North Central Region, followed by 56.8% in the North west Region and 56.0% in the North east Region), while the lowest proportion of isolates that were MRSA was seen in the South east Region (44.9%) (Figure 3) . The South East Region is comprised of Palm Beach, Broward, Miami -Dade , and Monroe Counties. The North Central Region is comprised of Gadsden, Liberty, Franklin, Leon, Wakulla, Jefferson, Madison, Taylor, Hamilton, Suwannee, Lafayette, Dixie, and Columbia Counties. The Northwest Region is comprised of Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Holmes, Washington, Bay, Jackson, Calhoun, and Gulf Counties. The Northeast Region is comprised of Baker, Union, Gilchrist, Levy, Marion, Alachua, Bradford, Putn am, Flagler, Clay, St. Johns, Duval, and Nassau Counties. Figure 2.

Proportion of Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested by a commercial laboratory that were oxacillin-resistant (MRSA), by patient's county of residence, Florida, 2010 Conclusions Community-associated MRSA is a significant source of skin and soft tissue infections in Florida. Knowledge of the community antibiogram can be clinically useful when considering options for empirical treatment of skin infections. The proportion of S. aureus infections diagnosed in an outpatient setting that are MRSA is around 50%. Based on this high prevalence of MRSA, empiric treatment of skin and soft tissue infections with -lactam antibiotics is not recommended. A more detailed surveillance report on community-associated S. aureus is available on the FDOH website at: http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Disease_ctrl/epi/htopics/anti_res/ MRSA_StatewideSummary_CHDs.pdf.218Section 4: of quinolone-resistant Neisseria meningitidis in the U.S. has raised important questions regarding current chemoprophylaxis guidelines and highlights the expanding threat of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded to this threat by forming MeningNet, an enhanced meningococcal surveillance system that will be used to monitor antimicrobial susceptibility. As part of MeningNet, Florida Bureau of Laboratories (BOL) began forwarding all N. meningitidis isolates to the CDC for antibiotic susceptibility testing in late 2008. Of the 60 cases of meningococcal disease in Florida in 2010, 55 cases had an isolate that was submitted to CDC for testing as part of MeningNet. Of those 55 isolates that were sent, four were non-viable upon arrival at CDC. All 51 remaining isolates from Florida were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and azithromycin with the use of the Etest. Isolates that screened positive for decreased susceptibility were confirmed with the use of broth microdilution. All other isolates were fully (100%) susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin and fully susceptible or intermediate-susceptible to penicillin. Only one isolate tested non-susceptible to azithromycin, all other isolates were susceptible. This case was in an infant from Northwest Florida with serogroup B infection. No travel history or epidemiologicaly linked cases were noted. Neisseria gonorrhoeae BackgroundThe treatment and control of gonorrhea has been challenged due to the development of resistance to several antimicrobial agents over time. In the 1970's the standard treatments of penicillin and tetracycline were abandoned due to increased resistance. As late as 2007, an increase in fluoroquinolone resistant isolates prompted recommendations for new treatment guidelines supporting the use of cephalosporins for gonococcal infections. In some parts of the world, the bacterium is now showing potential resistance to cephalosporins, the only recommended class of antibiotics left. The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) was established in 1986 to continuously monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains of N. gonorrhoeae across 30 cities in the United States. In Florida, the Miami-Dade Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) clinic has served as one of 29 GISP sites since 1998. The Miami-Dade STD clinic collects specimens each month for culture from symptomatic males. If the Gram stain is positive for the presence of diplococci, the specimen is forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories-Miami for growth detection and identification, and then shipped to the CDC until 25 viable N. gonorrhoeae isolates are reached for the month. The CDC monitors susceptibility of isolates to cefixime, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, tetracycline, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and azithromycin. Data Trends In the past five years, 1,165 viable specimens were collected from the Miami-Dade GISP site. In 2010, 209 isolates were submitted in which resistance to penicillin and tetracycline remained high and resistance to the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, remained stable. Minimal increases in azithromycin were noted in 2010 compared to previous years. Recommendations to only use cephalosporins in 2007 have been credited with the steady decline of gonorrhea in Florida. Currently, the cephalosporin antibiotics, ceftriaxone and cefixime, have not shown any signs of resistance in Florida-submitted isolates.219Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Table 5. Percent of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Isolates Susceptible to * N is the total number of isolates found to be resistant to the selected antibiotic MIC=Minimum Inhibitory Concentration: the lowest concentration of antibiotic needed to inhibit visible growth of a microorganism in laboratory. CDC recommends the regimen of 250 mg IM in a single dose of ceftriaxone, 400 mg orally in a single dose of cefixime, or a single dose injectible cephalosporin regimen plus azithromycin (1g orally in a single dose) or doxycycline (100mg orally twice a day for 7 days) for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. This disease is spread by aerosolized droplets from individuals with active TB when they cough, sing, speak, or laugh. Each year there are over nine million infections and 1.7 million deaths caused by the disease worldwide. The development of drug resistance is a serious development for patient care and public health. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is TB that is resistant to at least two of the most important anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampin. These drugs are considered first-line drugs and are used to treat all persons with TB disease. The Florida Department of Health (FDOH) BOL conducts susceptibility testing on all initial specimens positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex submitted from Florida healthcare entities, as well as county health d epartment clinics. Current DataIn 2010, the susceptibility results to the first-line TB drugs for specimens submitted to the BOL for analysis are listed in Table 6. There were 4 patients diagnosed with MDR TB in Florida.220Section 4: Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Table 6.

Bacillus cereus Bacillus cereus Outbreak Involving Supermarket Catered Meats, Orange County, January 2010On January 11, 2010 the Orange County Health Department (OCHD) was notified through the Florida Poison Information Center Network of a suspect foodborne illness outbreak. At least 14 people experienced diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, starting 6-8 hours after a birthday party on January 9, 2010. Meats, desserts, and snacks at the party were purchased at a local grocery store, while the remaining items were provided by friends and family members. An outbreak investigation was initiated involving the OCHD Epidemiology and Environmental Health Programs, the regulatory agency for grocery stores, and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (DACS). A list of guests and a menu of the catered and homemade foods were provided by the person filing the complaint. A questionnaire was developed and phone interviews of party guests were conducted by OCHD Epidemiology Program staff. In addition, samples of the leftover pork and baked chicken, along with stool samples from two ill guests, were shipped to the Florida Bureau of Laboratories (BOL) for testing. Seventeen out of twenty-six guests interviewed reported becoming ill. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant association between illness and consumption of the baked chicken and pork from the supermarket. The food samples tested at the BOL were positive for the presence of Bacillus cereus . The submitted stool samples tested E.coli O157:H7 , and Campylobacter . There is no testing available through BOL for Bacillus cereus in stool samples, but the clinical syndrome is consistent with infection by this agent. A joint inspection of the supermarket was conducted by OCHD and DACS on January 12, 2010; during this time 23 violations were identified. The violations included employees improperly washing hands before and after changing gloves, paper towels not available at all hand wash sinks, no date mark on multiple ready-to-eat foods, and pork and chicken products held at temperatures below appropriate temperatures (135 degrees Fahrenheit). The epidemiological investigation, laboratory findings, and data analysis indicated an association between this outbreak of Bacillus cereus in party attendees and catered meats purchased and consumed from the supermarket on January 9, 2010. 225Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive bacteria that is associated with temperature abuse of food items like meats, milk, vegetables, fish, rice, pasta, potatoes, and cheese products. Brucellosis Confirmed Brucellosis with Hospital and Laboratory Exposures, Escambia County , October 2010 The Escambia County Health Department (ECHD) Epidemiology Program received a call on October 27, 2010 from a local hospital concerning a possible positive Brucella culture from an Alabama resident. The investigation was initiated immediately with the cooperation of the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), the local hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs), and laboratory personnel. The ADPH stated that this person reported flu-like symptoms beginning in February 2010, and has had chronic back pain since that time. It was reported by the hospital ICPs that on October 6, the person presented to the Escambia County hospital for a needle biopsy of a vertebral abscess. Fluid from the abscess was extracted and introduced onto culture media in the operating room. The culture results were inconclusive. On October 22, the person returned to the hospital for a core biopsy using a surgical drill. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a bone specimen were collected. The microbiology laboratory reported heavy bacterial growth in the culture media. This specimen was forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories in Pensacola and was positive via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Brucella on October 27. Subsequently, the specimen was typed as Brucella suis Biovar 1, which was later confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There were several factors considered in the identification of all potentially exposed hospital staf f. The unusually heavy bacterial growth from the CSF culture indicated there was a high risk of the bacteria artificially aerosolizing during both of the previous medical procedures creating possible exposures among health care staff. There were also possible exposures in those who were in contact with the biopsy specimens and/or the pure bacterial culture. The ICPs identified all hospital staff recorded as being present during the October 6 and October 22 procedures, as well as all microbiology and pathology laboratory workers who were exposed to the biopsy specimens and/or pure bacterial culture. Those identified were assessed for their need to begin CDC recommended prophylaxis, fever watch, and serological follow-up. A total of 28 individuals were identified as being possibly exposed. This included 25 medical personnel classified as having had a high risk exposure and three with low risk exposures. T wenty-three individuals accepted prophylaxis, including one pregnant laboratory worker and one laboratory student who was breastfeeding. There were three individuals with high risk exposures who refused prophylaxis. The ill person had a previous history of hunting and butchering pigs, foreign missionary travel, and consuming ice cream made from un-pasteurized milk. Due to the multiple risk factors associated with this case, a bioterrorism threat was not suspected. As a precaution, and since Brucella is a Category B bioterrorism agent, the Public Health Preparedness Division and the Regional Emergency Response Advisor (RERA) were notified of this case. Brucellosis Case with Lab Exposures, Highlands County, July 2010 On Tuesday, July 6, the Highlands County Health Department (HCHD) was notified by a local hospital infection control practitioner (ICP) of a suspect brucellosis case in a man aged 50 years. An investigation in conjunction with the ICP, the hospital laboratory, the Orange County Health Department and the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville (BOL) was initiated. On July 15, 2010 speciation testing at BOL confirmed that the organism was Brucella suis .226Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 The man presented to the emergency department on June 26 with a six-month history of intermittent high fever and a dry cough. Other symptoms included sweating, malaise, headache, and loss of appetite. Blood samples for culture were obtained at the local hospital A, located in Highlands County, with initial Gram staining conducted on July 2. The sample was forwarded to another hospital laboratory B, located in Orange County, for further testing. The man was treated with Doxycycline and Rifampin and was released from the hospital with a 34-day regimen of antibiotics. He is a regular hunter with exposures to secretions of wild pigs and went hunting almost weekly during the winter months. He did not report any recent travel or consumption of un-pasteurized foods. He has no occupational risk, and no known contacts with similar symptoms. Neither of the hospital laboratories used the appropriate precautions when handling the specimen and performing the blood culture, as the treating physician did not notify the laboratory that brucellosis was part of the differential diagnoses for this case. Risk assessment and post exposure prophylaxis considerations were evaluated for those exposed to the culture at both hospital A and hospital B. There were two laboratory workers identified at hospital A who met the definition of high risk, and five high-risk exposures were identified at hospital B. There were no low risk exposures identified. Both hospitals were provided guidance on the prophylaxis and testing of exposed staff. No evidence of brucellosis transmission was reported and all exposed laboratory workers had negative serologic test results at week 24. Laboratory exposures to the sample could have been eliminated or reduced if suspicion of brucellosis had been communicated to the testing laboratory so that appropriate precautions could be taken when handing the culture. Education on the risk of exposures to laboratory workers was provided to the hospital and to the treating physician. This investigation underscores the need for effective communication methods and good laboratory training as Brucella suis is endemic in Florida's wild pig population. Campylobacteriosis Campylobacter jejuni at a Correctional Facility, Sumter County, August 2010The Sumter County Health Department (SCHD) Epidemiology Program was contacted by a nursing supervisor at a Sumter County Correctional Institution (CI) on August 19, 2010. The nursing supervisor reported an increase in gastrointestinal illnesses (GI) at the CI. During the initial telephone call, seven illnesses were reported. The total CI population was 1,694 inmates with 432 staff members. The CI conducted enhanced surveillance by surveying inmates in their dormitories, identifying all who experienced either vomiting or diarrhea during the week of August 16 - 20. Following the survey, the number of GI illnesses reported at the CI increased to 75 inmates. A team of SCHD Epidemiology and Environmental Health staff and the Regional Environmental Epidemiologist (REE) completed an environmental assessment of the CI kitchen on August 24. The team also conducted in-person interviews with a random selection of inmates who met the definition for the outbreak, which was defined as inmates who experienced either diarrhea or vomiting from August 17-20. On August 25, an additional 22 interviews with non-ill inmates (controls) were completed by the Department of Corrections (DOC) staff. The SCHD picked up six stool specimens from the CI Medical Unit on August 20. One additional specimen was forwarded from the CI's hospital laboratory to a private laboratary for a total of seven specimens. Specimens were shipped to the Florida Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville and analyzed for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E.coli O157:H7, Shigella , and norovirus organisms. six stool samples tested positive for Campylobacter jejuni on August 26. One additional specimen tested at a local hospital laboratory was also positive, resulting in six confirmed cases. 227Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Forty-four interviews with 22 ill people and 22 controls were completed. Two of the inmates interviewed were categorized as secondary cases and one case was excluded due to missing information, for a total of 19 cases for analysis. Nineteen interviews were selected from the control group for comparison. The 19 cases were all men who resided in multiple dormitories and had a mean age of 36 (range=19-59). Symptoms reported included: diarrhea (100%) (19), diarrhea (N=1). The mean incubation reported was 68 hours (range=49-98 hours) with a mean duration of illnesses of 97 hours (range=51-145 hours). Illness onsets peaked on August 18. Respondents were surveyed about food items they consumed during the five days prior to the peak in onsets on August 18. Each day, three meals were served. The meal with the highest odds ratios was dinner on August 15, with four items that produced elevated odds ratios (coleslaw , mashed potatoes, broccoli, and gravy). Each item was statistically significant with odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values as follows: coleslaw 8.7, 0.0281. The Food Service Manager was interviewed to determine how the foods with elevated odds ratios had been prepared. Both the broccoli and gravy required only minimal hand contact during food preparation. The broccoli was received frozen and reheated. A dry powder mix was used to make the gravy. The mashed potatoes were boiled and a powder dairy mix was added to the final product. The coleslaw , which had the highest odds ratio, was prepared from scratch. To make the coleslaw, staff combined chopped lettuce, carrots, and mayonnaise and hand tossed the mixture in shallow pans. Kitchen staf f members were required to wear gloves when preparing the coleslaw, but the manager said it is possible the staff member who mixed the coleslaw did not wear gloves. The majority of the kitchen staff members were inmates of the CI. During the SCHD environmental assessment completed at CI on August 24, several food safety issues were identified. These issues included a lack of sanitizer detected in kitchen cleaning solutions, improper hand-hygiene by staff members, food storage in non-food grade containers, improper food container labeling, and dirty equipment. During the assessment, one inmate was observed washing his hands without soap and then dried his hands on his shirt. Hand towels were missing near the staf f sink. When possible, the issues were corrected immediately on-site. To prevent further disease transmission, the CI placed a movement restriction on inmates at the facility with GI symptoms starting on August 20. Inmates in dormitories with an isolation and/or restriction were not permitted to participate in visitation and were restricted from attending meals in the dining hall. Strict hand-washing precautions were enforced for inmates, staff, and visitors at the CI. Carbon Monoxide Carbon Monoxide Poisonings in Homes with Attached Garages, Palm Beach County, May 2010In May, the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control investigated several cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. These cases involved exposure in homes with cars left running in attached garages. The first incident was reported on May 6. Four individuals were exposed when a car was left running in the garage for one and one half hours. Two women, aged 78 and 82 years, reported symptoms of headache and dizziness and were taken to a local hospital Emergency Room. Their carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels tested at the hospital were within normal levels (<9%). Oxygen was administered and they were observed until asymptomatic and then discharged. 228Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 The second incident was reported May 19. A woman aged 74 years was exposed when a car was left running in the garage for over three hours. She reported symptoms of dizziness, weakness, headache, and nausea. Testing completed in a local hospital emergency room found a COHb level of 28%. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Oxygen and IV fluids were administered and the individual was discharged asymptomatic the following day. Throughout 2010, the PBCHD Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control saw an increase in the number of carbon monoxide poisoning cases identified. PBCHD investigated 39 reported cases of carbon monoxide poisoning as compared to four in 2009. Of the cases reported in 2010, 20 cases were related to automobiles left running accidentally in homes with attached garages, nine were related to using improperly vented cooking equipment, two were related to the use of a generator in a boat, and one case occurred as part of a residential fire. Overall, seven of the cases were identified as intentional. There were six carbon monoxide related fatalities of which two were unintentional. All 13 unintentional cases were in people aged >65 years who accidentally left a car running in an attached garage. In an effort to raise carbon monoxide poisoning awareness within the community and throughout the state, PBCHD coordinated with print, broadcast, and other media to provide prevention information. In addition, PBCHD worked with the state health office to better understand possible automobile related issues and risk factors. Investigations included whether automobiles with push button starters or remote starters and distractions such as cell phone use were associated with the increase in vehicles left running. Results are pending. Chikungunya Fever Chikungunya Fever Case Imported from India, Miami-Dade County, January 2010The Miami-Dade County Health Department was notified of a chikungunya fever case on January 25, 2010. The patient was a woman aged 54 years who had spent one month in India, returning January 5. She developed symptoms on January 9 with neck pain, bilateral shoulder pain, bilateral knee pain, and bilateral wrist and hand pain. The next day she had a fever (up to 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit), chills, headache, and nausea, but no vomiting. On January 11 she developed a generalized maculopapular erythematous rash that began in the face and spread down to her lower extremities and abdomen. She was admitted to a local hospital on January 13 where the physician suspected chikungunya or dengue fevers. Serological studies were ordered to confirm or eliminate these diseases. Results from a commercial laboratory indicated a chikungunya IgM antibody titer of 1:160 1:40. antibody titer was consistent with an acute chikungunya virus infection and past infection with dengue virus. The laboratory specimen was forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories and then on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where acute chikungunya virus infection was confirmed and dengue infection was ruled-out. The patient travels every year to India to visit her parents. She never takes any prophylaxis prior to traveling. There were no sick contacts identified. The Mosquito Control Division inspected 52 premises near the case's residence between January 29 and February 1. At that time, two containers (buckets) were breeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, a competent vector for chikungunya. After discovery, this was corrected and all basins in the area were treated with pesticides. Infection with chikungunya virus is a risk for travelers to endemic countries, primarily in Asia and Africa. The incubation period is usually 3-7 days, but can be 2-12 days. Symptoms include fever , headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and joint pain. It can be easily confused with other illnesses such as dengue. The viremic period typically lasts about four days, beginning with onset of symptoms. This woman returned to Florida during that time period, so transmission to local mosquitoes is possible. It is important to notify local mosquito control promptly when cases of chikungunya are identified to limit the potential for local transmission.229Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Cholera First Imported Cholera Case in Florida and the United States from the 2010 Epidemic in Haiti, Collier County, November 2010 Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with toxigenic Vibrio cholerae , a bacterium. A person can develop cholera after eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with the bacteria. Water or food sources can become contaminated by feces from a person infected with cholera. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an outbreak of cholera was confirmed in Haiti on October 21, 2010. Following the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, a significant disruption in sanitation, hygiene, and water access had occurred. Although it is not clearly understood how cholera was re-introduced into this region after no documented cases had been noted for decades, the conditions were suitable for such an outbreak to occur. On November 4, 2010 the Epidemiology and Health Assessment Program of the Collier County Health Department (CCHD) received a report of a suspected cholera case from the Infection Control Department of a major local hospital. The suspected case was in an elderly woman that had returned to Florida from Haiti on November 1 due to diarrheal illness. The patient had onset of watery diarrhea on October 23, 2010 while visiting her family in Gonaives, Haiti. Gonaives is in the Artibonite Department which was the epicenter of the 2010 Cholera outbreak in Haiti. While in Haiti she had used the community well for drinking and bathing. After returning to Florida, she was hospitalized on November 4 for the management of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was treated with doxycycline, intravenous hydration, and antiemetics. She was discharged to her home on November 9. Stool specimens collected at the time of hospital admission were forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories in Jacksonville and tested positive for Vibrio cholerae O1, serotype Ogawa. Specimens were transported to the CDC for further characterization including toxigenicity testing. On November 16, 2010 the CDC confirmed toxigenic V. cholerae O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor which was the same strain found in the 2010 Haitian epidemic. The patient lived with five other family members: her son, daughter-in-law , and their three children aged 15 and 13 years and 18 months. The daughter-in-law, a previous Certified Nursing Assistant, was knowledgeable on basic infection control procedures. The patient utilized a separate bathroom in the house while symptomatic. The daughter-in-law regularly cleaned the home with bleach after her mother-in-law was discharged home. No secondary transmission occurred as a result of this confirmed case. Imported Cholera Case from Haiti in Orange County, November 2010 On November 17, 2010 the Orange County Health Department (OCHD) received notification from a local hospital of a suspected cholera case in a nine year-old black girl from Haiti. OCHD began an epidemiologic investigation and found that the patient was born and raised in Haiti. She traveled alone from Gonaives, Haiti to Orlando on November 9. The patient's father stated her symptoms began on November 9 after her arrival in Orlando. The patient had diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She was initially seen in the emergency department (ED) at a local hospital on November 11. The patient was diagnosed with diarrhea attributed to an unknown viral pathogen and discharged home. On November 13 she returned to the ED at the same hospital and was admitted due to dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy , and diarrhea that had become more watery. Upon admission to the hospital it was discovered that the patient had recently moved from Haiti, which prompted V. cholerae testing. She was treated and discharged from the hospital once symptoms improved. The patient's father stated nobody else around the patient in Haiti was ill with diarrhea. He did not know what type of water or food she had consumed in Haiti. The patient' s household contacts in Orlando remained asymptomatic. Prevention of illness with good hand hygiene was discussed with the patient's father. 230Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 The laboratary at the admitting hospital reported light growth of V. cholerae from a stool culture on November 17. An isolate from the hospital laboratary was confirmed as V. cholerae O1, serotype Ogawa by the Bureau of Laboratories in Jacksonville on November 22 . On November 24, 2010 the isolate was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as toxigenic V. cholerae O1, serotype Ogawa. The strain identified matched the strain found in Haiti which linked the Orange County case to the Haiti outbreak. On November 29, 2010 OCHD issued a press release about the confirmed cholera case. OCHD enhanced surveillance efforts and disseminated cholera updates and health information to local health care providers in an effort to locate any additional cases. Dengue Fever Imported Dengue Fever in a College Student, Alachua County, March 2010On March 26, 2010 the Alachua County Health Department (ACHD) Epidemiology Program received a report from a local university student health care center of a female university student aged 26 years who traveled to Colombia from March 4 - 12, 2010. The patient presented on March 19 with symptoms of fever, chills, joint pains, diarrhea, muscle aches, bright red macular and papular rash on her face and upper body, eye pain, nausea, and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia were also noted. Blood drawn for antibody testing was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dengue Laboratory in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On April 18, IgG and IgM tests for dengue antibodies were positive and dengue virus type 1 was identified. The patient reported that she and her professor were doing ecology field work in the cities of Medellin and Villavicencio. The patient reported that while she was in Colombia she used DEET intermittently and did not use any mosquito netting. The patient did wear long pants and long sleeved shirts. An interview was also conducted with the professor who traveled with the patient. He reported that he remained asymptomatic. He stated that he was from Colombia and has no history of dengue fever . Imported Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Duval County, May 2010On June 10, the Duval County Health Department (DCHD) Epidemiology Program received an electronic laboratory result from a commercial laboratory for a man aged 52 years which was IgM positive for dengue fever virus. The patient was previously known to DCHD as a suspected case of typhoid fever. The man traveled to Costa Rica with his wife from May 15 - 22, 2010 to a remote area in the eastern coastal area of Costa Rica near the Panama border. They rented a home in the jungle, walked through a stream to reach their home, and participated in many outdoor activities, including snorkeling and hiking. The patient and his wife both noted mosquito bites on their legs. The couple moved to a location on the Pacific side of the country after three days. On May 19, the fifth day of their trip, the patient developed fever , diarrhea, and nausea. He remained in his hotel room for two days and felt well enough to return home on May 22. The next day the patient' s fever increased and he complained that his bones hurt. During this time, the patient continued to have intermittent diarrhea and nausea, and did not eat in order to avoid vomiting. The patient went to his primary physician on May 27, and later to the emergency department (ED) after he developed worsening pain in his bones, and his wife noted several short bouts of confusion. The patient was evaluated, treated with quinine and doxycycline, and discharged to his home from the ED. His condition continued to worsen and he was admitted to the hospital on May 30 with body aches, joint pain, loss of appetite, generalized weakness, ringing and pressure in his ears, and a slight rash on the chest. He developed thrombocytopenia and evidence of plasma leakage. He later developed a petechial rash on the extremities and trunk of his body .231Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 The patient was initially reported to Duval County Health Department (DCHD) Epidemiology Program in early June with a positive serum agglutination test (Widal Test) suggestive of typhoid fever. Inquiries were made regarding additional stool and blood specimens, but none had been obtained. The patient did not meet the case definition for typhoid fever. After receipt of the laboratory results suggestive of dengue fever, DCHD requested that the commercial laboratory forward the specimen to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville for confirmation. The specimen was confirmed IgM and IgG positive for dengue fever. It is common for individuals with dengue to have non-specific symptoms, like fever , at the beginning of illness and develop more characteristic symptoms like bone pain and rash over the next few days. In severe cases of dengue, the fever often resolves within 2 to 7 days and then warning signs like abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding, and decrease in platelet count develop, signaling the critical stage of illness when patients may manifest the hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome associated with infection. If the fever lasts longer than seven days, it is evidence of misdiagnosis or co-infection. In this case the patient may have had both dengue and typhoid fever. Eastern Equine Encephalitis Fatal Hillsborough County, July 2010A middle-aged woman from Hillsborough County with previous underlying medical conditions died as a result of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). On July 12, the HCHD Epidemiology Program was contacted by the county Medical Examiner after a woman died from encephalitis of unknown etiology. The Medical Examiner asked the HCHD for recommendations for further testing of the frozen Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) of the deceased. The only arboviral test that had been performed at the hospital was for West Nile virus, which was negative. HCHD recommended an arboviral panel and the specimen was sent to the Bureau of Laboratories - T ampa (BOL). On June 21, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with high fever and headache and was admitted to the hospital. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone. She later developed a stiff neck and altered mental status. The patient had a lumbar puncture and results were consistent with meningitis. The patient subsequently developed respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation and later died. On Friday, July 16, BOL reported a strongly positive EEE IgM antibody test from the cerebral spinal fluid of the deceased. The EEE PCR test was equivocal. The clinical presentation and the positive IgM test met the case definition for a confirmed case of EEE. This was the first reported case of EEE in Florida in 2010. The deceased had no travel history within the two weeks prior to her onset and was also unemployed. Her children reported that she spent significant time sitting outside her home, and she was often bitten by mosquitoes. During the summer of 2010, both sentinel chickens and horses in Hillsborough County tested positive for EEE. Hillsborough County was already under a mosquito-borne disease advisory; the HCHD reissued the advisory on July 20, 2010. The advisory focused on getting people to protect themselves from mosquitoes. Mosquito control was notified of the EEE case and sprayed the area where the woman was likely infected.232Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Ehrlichiosis Ehrlichiosis Imported from North Carolina, Martin County, June 2010 On June 7, 2010 the Martin County Health Department (MCHD) Epidemiology Division received an Ehrilichia chaffeensis positive laboratory result from a local hospital. The report indicated that titers for E. chaffeensis were IgG <1:64, IgM <1:64. The patient was a white woman aged 79 years who presented with anorexia, nausea, malaise, and a persistent fever (maximum of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit). Illness onset was May 29. She had recently traveled to visit her son in North Carolina, returning to Florida approximately one week prior to the onset of symptoms. She noted on May 27 that there were two engorged ticks on her body , which she removed herself. The areas surrounding the tick bite were still erythematous when she presented at the emergency room on June 2. The remainder of the acute sample was sent to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville, along with a convalescent serum specimen collected on June 12 for titer comparison. Ehrlichia chaffeensis was confirmed with a four-fold rise in IgG titer to 1:256. Haiti Reportable Diseases Imported to Florida from Haiti Following an Earthquake, Statewide, 2010On January 12, 2010 an earthquake struck near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, creating enormous devastation. Florida's close proximity to Haiti resulted in >22,000 people entering Florida from Haiti as part of federal repatriation and humanitarian parolee efforts. Travel between Florida and Haiti has been common for many years and reportable diseases introduced by travelers returning from Haiti are frequently identified. Due to the anticipated large influx of persons into Florida from Haiti after the earthquake, Florida enhanced surveillance efforts for reportable disease cases. Merlin was used to document cases of reportable diseases in people coming to Florida who were in Haiti at the time of or after the earthquake, regardless of residency. The Outbreak Module within Florida's reportable disease surveillance system, Merlin, was used to capture data on Haitian travel, medical condition upon entry into the U.S., citizenship, and residency. The distribution of reportable diseases acquired in Haiti during the post-earthquake period (January 12, 2010-March 12, 2010) was compared to a 2009 reference period (January 12, 2009-March 12, 2009). Only 20 reportable disease cases imported from Haiti were recorded during the 2009 reference period, with malaria accounting for 15 (75%) and giardiasis two (10%). During the post-earthquake period, 51 cases were recorded in Florida residents, lead poisoning accounting for 21 (41%) cases and malaria 15 (29%). An additional 31 cases in non-Florida residents were recorded during the post-earthquake period, with malaria contributing 13 (42%) and lead poisoning 6 (19%). Malaria cases continued to be imported throughout 2010, with >60 imported cases in Florida residents and non-residents. Survey data was collected for 64 cases, some in Florida residents and some in non-residents. Upon arrival, 38% of the people with reportable diseases needed acute medical care: of those, 64% required care for their suspected infectious illness, 18% for trauma/injury, 9% for dehydration/malnutrition, and 10% for other reasons. Merlin allowed Florida to capture cases of disease imported from Haiti in both Florida residents and non- residents, and provided an efficient way to gather additional data on those cases, which could be used for important public health messaging. The influx of people arriving from Haiti resulted in a substantial increase in reportable diseases. A significant minority of cases were detected in people who sought care for other reasons. This type of information may be useful in response planning for similar events in the future. 233Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Hepatitis Hepatitis A Outbreak in Men who have Sexual Contact with Men, Orange County, May-September 2010 In 2010, there were a total of 19 cases of hepatitis A reported to the Orange County Health Department (OCHD), of which 12 had occurred in men who had sexual contact with men (MSM). Historically , most people with hepatitis A reported in Orange County have traveled outside of the U.S., where exposure was likely. However, none of the 12 affected people in the MSM population reported foreign travel during their exposure period. A common link among all 12 men was not identified. No common food or water source was implicated in this outbreak. A few of the men were sexual contacts or acquaintances of each other. All twelve men reported frequenting several restaurants, bars, and clubs in Orange County . It is possible that hepatitis A transmission occurred through social gatherings. The onset of illness ranged from May 3 to September 11, 2010. Three of the cases were in food handlers and one was in a healthcare worker. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation along with Environmental Health inspected the restaurants and the hospital infection control department was notified of the ill employee. Close contacts of the people with hepatitis A were offered prophylaxis if they were inside the window for prophylaxis. The Orange County Health Department increased educational outreach in the MSM population. The STD Disease Intervention Specialists distributed information on hepatitis A in the MSM population on field visits to frequented establishments. The Hepatitis Prevention Program coordinator continued vaccination outreach events to high-risk populations, including \"Come Out With Pride\" on October 10, 2010, \"Rainbow Health Fair\" on November 6, 2010, drug treatment centers, homeless shelters, and jails. OCHD attempted to publish awareness articles in local newspapers and to coordinate a vaccination outreach event at a local theme park where one of the ill people was employed. Hepatitis B Outbreak Associated with Home Health Care Agency, Palm Beach County, October 2010 Between October 30 and the end of December 2010, the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) identified a cluster of three people residing at two Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) with positive serology results for acute hepatitis B. Two of these resided at ALF 1 and one at ALF 2. The two facilities were linked because they both received skilled nursing services from the same home health agency (HHA). The exposure period for this outbreak was estimated to be between May 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. Site visits to both ALFs were conducted to identify potential sources of blood borne pathogen exposure and to evaluate infection control practices, specifically diabetes care procedures. A retrospective analysis of risk factors among the infected and non-infected residents in ALF 1 was done to determine the most probable source of hepatitis B transmission in the facility. Relative risks (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values were calculated for the exposures at ALF 1. Medical records review, a behavioral risk factor survey, and a survey of the nurses working for the HHA during the exposure period were conducted. At ALF 2, only specific data were abstracted from the medical records of insulin dependent diabetic residents, based on preliminary results from ALF 1. Testing for hepatitis B was done for all residents at ALF 1. At ALF 2, testing for hepatitis B was done on diabetic patients receiving insulin and glucose monitoring. Forty-eight residents were tested for viral hepatitis in ALF 1. Five residents were positive for acute hepatitis B. Two residents showed recent infection with hepatitis B virus and were immune. Six cases were diabetic and had received glucose monitoring or insulin administration during the exposure period. Only one case was not diabetic but was the sexual partner of one of the cases. All the cases had resided at the facility longer than six months prior to positive testing. At ALF 2, ten diabetic patients were tested. In addition to the initial acute infected person, who was also a diabetic, a chronic case was found. Molecular gene sequencing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the virus from specimens collected at both facilities was identical. Residents in ALF 1 who were diabetic were found to be fourteen times more likely than234Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 those who did not, to have acute or recent HBV infection. The association was statistically significant with a p-value <0.05. Other health care procedures did not show an association with HBV infection. Several infection control deficiencies related to diabetes care were found in ALF 1 and 2 including cross-contamination, improper cleaning and storage of glucometers, and lancing devices. The most probable route of transmission of HBV in ALF 1 was from resident to resident during fingerstick glucose monitoring and/or insulin administration. The HBV DNA sequencing results among residents in ALF 1 supported the hypothesis of transmission within the facility . Epidemiologic data and infection control deficiencies found during the site visits also support this hypothesis. T ransmission between the two facilities was also supported by the HBV DNA molecular sequencing results, the infection control deficiencies, and the movement of nursing personnel between the two ALFs evidenced in the review of the HHA nurses schedules. Furthermore, the results of the HHA nursing survey showed that some of the HHA nurses used the same lancing device and glucometer for several residents. Based on the findings during the investigation, several recommendations to the administrators of the ALFs and the HHA were provided. Hepatitis B vaccination for all susceptible residents at ALF 1 and susceptible diabetic residents receiving glucose monitoring in ALF 2 was implemented. Training on infection control for bloodborne pathogens and diabetes care procedures was recommended and completed by the HHA nurses. The facilities changed the use of spring-loaded reusable finger stick devices to auto-disable, single use lancets to collect specimens for glucose monitoring. No new cases were reported after the last testing was conducted during the investigation. Hepatitis C Cluster Associated with a Healthcare Facility, Duval County, 2010 Three cases of hepatitis C infection occurred over a three-year period in patients treated at a Duval County healthcare facility. An epidemiologic investigation in coordination with the healthcare facility, the Florida Department of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the three hepatitis C virus strains from these cases were genetically related. The three cases did not have any behavioral risk factors for infection or any obvious lapses in infection control at the healthcare facility . In 2010, the investigators focused on the interventional radiology area since all three patients had undergone procedures within that area at different times over the three-year period. An employee in the interventional radiology unit tested positive for the hepatitis C virus in the spring of 2010. On July 26, 2010 the hepatitis C virus strain from the employee was found to be genetically related to the strains from the three patients. The healthcare facility launched an internal investigation and the employee admitted to drug diversion in the interventional radiology unit. The healthcare facility sent over 3,200 letters to individuals who may have been at risk due to this former employee's actions, and recommended testing for blood borne pathogens. Influenza Influenza A Outbreak at a Correctional Detention Center, Miami-Dade County, March 2010On March 16, 2010 the Miami-Dade County Health Department (MDCHD), Epidemiology , Disease Control and Immunization Services (EDC-IS) received a report from a local detention center nurse that five inmates had been admitted to a local hospital with influenza-like illness (ILI): two inmates out of 68 in one unit, and three inmates out of 62 in another unit. After further investigation with the infection control practitioner of the correctional facility, it was determined that there were a total of nine inmates involved in this outbreak. Based on investigations with the detention center, the earliest onset of symptoms was March 9. Five inmates at the detention facility were sent to a local hospital, were admitted, and had positive rapid tests for influenza A. The Bureau of Laboratories - Miami branch confirmed three specimens positive for 2009 influenza A H1N1. One inmate who tested negative (rapid test) for influenza was also sent to the hospital, but was not originally235Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 reported. Three additional inmates from different units, with symptoms of ILI, also tested negative and were not sent to the hospital. All ill inmates were part of the general inmate population. Those who had been in contact with the sick inmates were put on restrictive movement. A recommendation letter was sent to the correctional institution encouraging good hygiene practices among inmates and staff and removal of symptomatic inmates from dormitories until at least 24 hours after fever has ceased. No additional cases were identified. Workplace Cluster of Influenza, Palm Beach County, May 2010 On May 5, 2010 the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) received a report of several workers experiencing respiratory symptoms at a local business. The report was triggered by a positive influenza A H1N1 PCR in one of the workers and the increasing number of employees reporting illness. A private physician diagnosed the positive individual with influenza-like Illness (ILI) on April 30, 2010 and a positive influenza A H1N1 PCR result was reported on May 5, 2010. The worker was not hospitalized. There were 83 exposed employees congregated in a two-story building. The main area reporting sick workers was located on the north side of the first floor of the building. An individual was classified as having a case of influenza-like illness (ILI) if they reported having fever of >100 degrees Fahrenheit plus cough, sore throat or other respiratory symptoms. Between April 30 and May 7, 2010 twenty-seven workers were classified as having cases (attack rate 29%). The Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to the 2009 - 2010 Influenza Season was provided to the employees' physician for implementation. By Friday, May 7, 2010 all the ill workers had been excluded from work and advised to return to work according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Symptomatic employees were recommended to see their private physician to evaluate need for treatment and to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab for PCR testing. The non-ill workers were provided information about ILI symptoms, and were advised to see their private physician and stay home if they became sick. Measures such as routine environmental cleaning, instruction on proper hand washing, respiratory etiquette, and hand sanitizer availability were implemented. Screening employees who reported to work for ILI was conducted daily. As part of the outbreak control measures, the PBCHD provided the H1N1 vaccine to the employees' physician office in order to vaccinate non-ill workers who were not previously vaccinated. Thirty-nine doses of the vaccine were administered between May 6 - 11. No new cases were reported after May 11, 2010. No nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR testing were ordered by the primary care doctors who saw symptomatic workers. Investigation of a Multi-State Influenza Outbreak in a Medical Missionary Group, Statewide, July 2010 On July 28, 2010, a St. Johns County resident aged 70 years was confirmed PCR-positive for H3N2 influenza A by the Bureau of Laboratories (BOL). Vigilance for, and follow-up on, unusual influenza results was heightened due to the recent influenza pandemic. Summer months are not typical periods of influenza activity . Because of this, the St. Johns County Health Department (SJCHD) investigated the laboratory result. The individual had been part of a medical mission group to Panama from July 16 - 24. The group consisted of approximately 75 missionaries from multiple states, including 10 Florida residents. A church in Georgia sponsored the medical mission as part of their Central American missions program, and the patient gave SJCHD the contact information for the trip coordinator. The Bureau of Epidemiology contacted the Georgia Department of Community Health, Division of Public Health (DPH), and notified them of the mission trip and the trip coordinator ' s contact information. After interviewing the trip coordinator, a Georgia resident, the Georgia DPH found that the mission group travelers came from 10 states across the southern U.S., and the trip coordinator reported that missionaries from other236Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 states also became ill after the trip. Georgia DPH notified the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Influenza Division, as well as influenza coordinators in af fected states, and collected data on influenza- like illness (ILI) in the travelers from each state. SJCHD followed up with all 10 Florida residents who traveled to Panama as part of the mission trip. It was not possible to collect additional specimens, but interviews showed that seven of the 10 Florida travelers experienced influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms as early as July 24, including weakness/malaise, sore throat, cough, fever of 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit lasting 4 to 5 days, sporadic diarrhea, and less commonly , headache and chills. A household contact of one of the travelers also became ill and tested rapid-antigen positive for influenza A. In total, 19 of the 75 missionaries from five of the 10 states became ill with ILI following the mission trip. One non-Florida resident received a rapid influenza test, and tested negative. No other travelers were tested. Klebsiella pneumoniae Outbreak of Infections Due to Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in a Long-term Acute Care Hospital in a Central Florida County, July 2010Carbapenems are a class of -lactam antimicrobials with broad-spectrum activity that are often used as a last-line treatment for serious healthcare-associated infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria. In recent years, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which are commonly resistant to almost all antimicrobial agents, have emerged worldwide. CREs are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and are difficult pathogens to control as they spread easily within healthcare settings. Resistance to carbapenems in the U.S. is most often mediated by the production of the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) family of serine -lactamases. KPC enzymes on plasmids, confer resistance to all -lactam antimicrobials, and are the primary mechanism for carbapenem resistance among CRKP . During July 2010, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) was contacted by staf f at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH A) in a central Florida County regarding the identification of CRE. LTACHs are extended-stay hospitals that care for complex patients who most often are transferred from acute care hospital intensive care units (ICUs) for continued management of chronic, intensive medical needs (e.g., ventilator dependence, chronic wounds, and intravenous medications). Staff from the responsible county health department (CHD) and FDOH met with staff at LTACH A to review infection control procedures and recommended implementing CDC's guidance for preventing CRE in acute care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/ mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm), including conducting a point prevalence survey for CRE via rectal swabs. In August, after 10 (25%) of 40 patients who underwent active surveillance testing at LTACH A were found to be positive for CRKP, FDOH and CHD staff again met with the facility staff and presented an action plan to prevent further CRE infections and transmission. In addition to improving infection control practices, the plan included continued active surveillance testing for CRE at admission, active surveillance testing at two-week intervals for all patients not known to be positive for CRE, and maintenance of a running line list of CRE positive patients. CRE has been present in LTACH A and acute care hospitals in the surrounding area since 2009, and transmission of CRE is ongoing in LTACH A. Ninety-nine LTACH A-onset CRE cases have been detected since March 2009, 34 were classified as probable transmission CRE cases detected since August 2010. The number of blood cultures positive for multi-drug-resistant organisms in L T ACH A was as high as 10 per month. CRE cases have made up a substantial proportion (10-50%) of these since 2010, suggesting that transmission of CRE is associated with infections causing morbidity and mortality . CRE is also being imported into L TACH A 237Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 from other facilities, contributing to the overall burden of CRE in L TACH A, increasing the risk of transmission. Molecular typing suggests a dominant strain for the majority of isolates tested. Since few samples were obtained from patients who were positive at admission to LTACH A and other LTACHs, and because the diversity of K. pneumoniae isolates in this and surrounding counties is not known, we are unable to determine if the same strain of K. pneumoniae has been circulating among other healthcare facilities. Lapses in multiple infection prevention practices, including hand hygiene, personal protective equipment use, device maintenance, and environmental cleaning practices, likely are contributing to transmission of CRE in LTACH A. Increased attention to infection prevention practices in LTACH A and among facilities across the healthcare continuum in this county and Florida are needed to prevent transmissions and infections associated with CRE. Legionellosis Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak Associated with a Health Fitness Club, Orange County, April 2010On April 5, 2010 the Orange County Health Department (OCHD) Epidemiology Program was notified by a local hospital of a laboratory-confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease with illness onset on March 31. During the interview, the aged 72 years man reported frequenting a local fitness club every day until March 30. He did not report having any water exposures. On April 7, the OCHD Epidemiology Program was notified of another laboratory-confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease with illness onset of April 2. This aged 69 years woman reported frequenting the same fitness club as the previously reported patient three times a week, with the last exposure on March 31. The patient reported exposures to the pool, whirlpool spa, and shower. An environmental health inspection of the fitness club was conducted on April 9 in response to the initial Legionella case and found multiple violations. As a result of the potential cluster of two or more similar illnesses linked to a common source, the OCHD Epidemiology Program initiated further investigation. The facility was re-assessed on April 13. Based on the environmental assessment and epidemiological data, environmental samples were collected from the whirlpool spa, water filter , and from the interior of the shower heads in both the male and female showers, and shipped to the Bureau of Laboratories for analysis. All environmental samples obtained from the fitness club collected on April 13 were culture negative for Legionella pneumophila . Epidemiologic data indicate that the source of the Legionella outbreak was the fitness club in Orlando, Florida. The only common exposure that may contribute to Legionnaire's disease among the two cases was visiting the facility during the 14 days prior to the reported illness onset. Environmental inspection observations at the fitness club whirlpool spa indicated conditions that could possibly support biofilm production and the harboring of Legionella bacteria. Maintenance logs consistently indicated chlorine levels in the spas below 2.0 ppm from March 20 to March 27 (recommended levels are between 2.0 -10.0 ppm). Legionnaires' disease is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with an estimated 8,000 to 18,000 cases in the United States each year. This disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, which can be found naturally in the environment, particularly in the type of warm water found in whirlpool spas, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, or parts of big air conditioner systems of large buildings. Malaria Imported Malaria in a Flight Attendant, Hillsborough County, July 2010On July 16, 2010 the Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) Epidemiology Program was notified by the Bureau of Epidemiology of a discharge diagnosis of \"malaria\" found in ESSENCE, Florida' s syndromic 238Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 surveillance system. Follow up with the hospital determined that the patient did in fact have malaria and the case had not been previously reported. A woman aged 35 years worked as a flight attendant for a major U.S. airline. Her recent travel history included multiple layovers in Abuja, Nigeria and one layover in Dakar, Senegal. Her last three-day layover was in Abuja and ended on July 6. On July 13, the patient developed night sweats. On July 14, she experienced one bout of diarrhea as well as a headache. She presented to the emergency department on July 15 with a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, chills, profuse sweats, neck pain, fatigue, mild nausea, and mild abdominal pain. The patient was concerned that she had malaria because she had not taken antimalarial medication while in Africa, and several of her coworkers (pilots and flight attendants) who fly this route had developed malaria in the past two years. The malaria smears were positive at the hospital laboratory (0.2% parasitemia). The slides were forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville where the species was identified as Plasmodium falciparum . The patient was treated with doxycycline and the anti-malarial drug atovaquone-proguanil.The patient was interviewed by HCHD staff. She reported difficulty in taking anti-malarials with her work schedule. She reported that she would need to be on them nearly all the time. She also stated that it is logistically difficult to get to a physician all the time for requisite prescriptions. While on her layovers in Nigeria, she does not leave the hotel. She occasionally visits the pool in the late afternoon. She does use a DEET based mosquito repellant or a anti-mosquito clip-on belt. She did not recall any mosquito bites. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on July 21. Upon learning of the malaria diagnosis on July 16, mosquito control was contacted and sprayed the area where the patient lives. Measles Measles Case in an Adult Traveler, Duval County, June 2010On June 2, 2010 a physician notified the Duval County Health Department (DCHD) Epidemiology Program of a suspected measles case. The physician's patient aged 63 years reported a fever onset on May 8, a rash onset on May 11, and cough, anorexia, conjunctivitis, coryza, and severe malaise that continued for at least three weeks after symptoms onset. Initial laboratory tests done by a commercial laboratory on May 24 were positive for IgM and IgG against the measles virus and were subsequently confirmed positive at the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville (BOL). A second serum sample was requested by BOL, and drawn by DCHD on June 4. The second specimen was also positive for measles IgM and IgG. The man had no measles vaccination history but did have natural immunity to varicella and mumps. He lived in Chile, Venezuela, and Mexico until he was aged 13 years and moved to the U.S. in 1960. His exposure period was estimated to be from April 23 to May 4. During this estimated exposure period, the patient and his wife traveled to Italy and Switzerland from April 15-26, 2010 with a tour group of approximately 30 people. Neither the man nor his wife noticed anyone ill on the trip or after they returned to Jacksonville. The man went to the doctor on April 29 for a leg infection and was treated with an antibiotic. He returned to the doctor for two appointments during the time when he could have potentially exposed other people. Due to the antibiotic prescribed on April 29 for the leg infection, the initial diagnosis by the physician was a drug reaction. When the patient returned to the office with a rash, the physician ordered testing for measles and advised the case to practice self-isolation.239Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 All of the identified contacts were interviewed including: the tour group manager , the physician office staff and patients, family members, fellow employees, and the manager of a local business where the patient and a family member had spent time together. No other measles cases were found during the investigation. Meningococcal Disease Fatal Meningococcal Disease in a Student, Collier County, November 2010On November 25, 2010 the Collier County Health Department (CCHD) received a report from the infection control nurse at a local hospital that a man aged 20 years died, and the emergency room physician suspected it was due to meningococcemia. When he presented to the hospital emergency department at 1 1:10 pm on November 24, the young man was awake, but the nurse was not able to obtain a blood pressure. His skin was cold, mottled and cyanotic. Seventeen hours prior to arriving at the hospital, he had onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, followed later (6:00 pm) by fever, light-headedness and a rash. Blood cultures were obtained and antibiotics were administered. The patient became unresponsive and resuscitation was attempted, but was unsuccessful. He died less than 20 hours after onset of symptoms. The patient was a student at a state university located in another county , and had received meningococcal disease vaccination in 2008. He was a member of a fraternity at school and resided in a house with three roommates. While attending school, he worked at the school recreation department approximately two hours per day. He also refereed football and soccer games at night. He rode for several hours in a car with a friend traveling from school to Naples on November 20, and then stayed at his parents' home in Naples. He attended many gatherings while in Naples. CCHD interviewed 73 people, and the investigation identified 46 close contacts who received antibiotic prophylaxis. The County Health Department serving his university spoke with a roommate and fraternity brother who reported the patient visited the fraternity house about once a week although sometimes more frequently. The president of the fraternity was also contacted. He reported the fraternity brothers were aware of the patient's death and they had contacted their private physicians to obtain prophylaxis. The Palm Beach County Health Department assisted CCHD with prophylaxis for the patient' s three roommates who were in Palm Beach County for the holiday weekend. The hospital provided prophylaxis to 18 staff members. The blood culture collected at the local hospital was positive for Neisseria meningitidis , and forwarded samples to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville. On December 7, BOL confirmed the isolate was N. meningitidis Group B. The meningococcal vaccine in use in the United States does not protect against Group B infection. This is the first confirmed case of N. meningitidis infection in Collier County since 2005. Mercury Poisoning Mercury Exposure in a Neighborhood, Broward County, August 2010On August 30, 2010 the Broward County Health Department (BCHD) Epidemiology Program followed up on a news media story from August 29 involving people exposed to mercury at a residence in Broward County. The exposure had reportedly taken place on August 28 when a neighbor found bottles of mercury in the garage of a house he had recently purchased. Children had been seen playing with the mercury in a neighborhood driveway. Eleven people were identified as being directly exposed to the mercury through inhalation and/or skin contact. BCHD was able to contact ten of these. None were symptomatic. Of the ten people interviewed seven had laboratory testing performed (one urinalysis and six blood mercury levels). Mercury was not detected in urinalysis. The blood mercury levels on all six individuals were reported as elevated over the expected value which is <8.0 mcg/L (range 14 mcg/L to 25 mcg/L). 240Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Abatement efforts were initiated August 31, 2010 when Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FLDEP) began the initial assessment of affected areas, including private homes and the driveway where exposure to the mercury had occurred. Five schools, the public library , 10 public vehicles, five school buses, and one additional driveway were assessed as potentially impacted areas. According to the EPA Pollution/Situation Report dated September 3, 2010 contractors hired by the EPA applied a solution called Hg Cs-102, allowed it to dry, and then used mercury vacuums to remove mercury beads from two driveways in the neighborhood. One driveway was removed as mercury presence was too extensive for abatement. Affected residences had ventilation fans brought in to aid in air exchange. One residence was found to have mercury in the shower, sink drains, and the washing machine. Hg Cs-102 was poured in the drains and washing machine to alleviate mercury vapor being released. Another residence had to remove furniture and other small items that had been contaminated, as well as the carpet and a tiled area. Following the carpet removal, the floors were thoroughly rinsed and the property was ventilated. The items collected from the households were inventoried and taken off-site to reduce the ambient mercury vapor readings. In places where mercury was found during rescreening, properties were mopped with Hg Cs-102 or had an EP A approved mercury scrubber installed, which processes ambient air and removes mercury gas. Mercury Poisoning in a Four-Year-Old, Hillsborough County, November 2010 On November 18, 2010 the Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) Epidemiology Program received a report from a hospital regarding a boy aged four years. The patient presented to the hospital on November 15 with a four day history of productive cough, difficulty in breathing, and sore throat. The patient received a preliminary diagnosis of bronchitis. An X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the child had metallic densities in the lungs. The doctors speculated that the foreign bodies in the chest had been aspirated. There were similar findings in the liver and colon. A colonoscopy revealed liquid, elemental mercury balls in the patient's large intestine, appendix, and stool. Mercury levels obtained from a blood sample were 34 ng/mL. The child tested negative for other heavy metals such as arsenic and lead. On November 19, the HCHD spoke to the Medical Director of the Florida Poison Information Center (FPIC) and the infection control practitioner at the hospital to review the plan for the patient. At this time, the child was asymptomatic and was discharged from the hospital. Discharge instructions stated that the child was not to return to his home until an environmental assessment of the home had been performed. On November 22, the HCHD interviewed the mother of the boy. The boy and his family were staying in a hotel at that time. The mother denied all mercury exposures, including liquid thermometers, older toys and mercury batteries. The child attended a local daycare, which was initially a concern for potential mercury exposure. Additionally , the patient's father works as a janitor at a local hospital, which brought up concerns regarding occupational exposures. There were eight residents of the patient's home. Two of the eight residents were small children, aged one and four years. Both of these children were asymptomatic, and unrelated to the patient. They were separated physically from the patient and his family through a partition in the home. The mother of these two children stated they had never been inside the boy's bedroom. On November 23, representatives from the HCHD and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) met at the boy's home to test for residential mercury levels. For residential properties, a mercury vapor reading of over 1000 ng/m3 necessitates a cleanup and removal by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Readings of the boy's bedroom on November 23 were 15,000 ng/m3. One dresser drawer in the boy's bedroom read 50,000 ng/m3. The HCHD contacted the Regional Emergency Response Advisor, the DEP 241Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Emergency Response, and then the National Response Center. The family was subsequently relocated to another hotel at EPA's expense until cleanup and potential remediation were performed. The other portions of the home had mercury vapor readings within normal limits. The abnormally high mercury vapor readings were confined to the boy's bedroom and adjacent areas. Still, the HCHD recommended evaluation and testing for the children who were household contacts. Both children were evaluated, but only one received testing for mercury. The results were negative. From November 24 to December 1, an EPA response team was deployed to the patient's home in Tampa for cleanup. The EPA found a few mercury beads underneath the dresser in the child's bedroom, and a substantial number of beads inside the dresser drawer. The EPA removed the dresser from the patient's home and allowed the home to ventilate for approximately one week. On December 1, a subsequent mercury vapor reading was performed and results inside the patient's bedroom were approximately 600 ng/m3, which is below the level requiring urgent action. When the windows of the home were opened, the level dropped to 100-200 ng/m3. On December 2, the family was contacted regarding these results and allowed to move back into the home. On December 3, the patient was seen for a clinical visit by the Medical Director of the FPIC. Because x-rays continued to show mercury in the lungs and appendix of the child, oral chelation therapy was recommended and completed. Despite repeated attempts to establish the source of the mercury beads inside and underneath the child' s dresser, the source was never determined. Norovirus Norovirus Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Facilities, Collier County, Florida, January - April 2010 From January through April 2010 the Collier County Health Department (CCHD) experienced a tremendous surge in the number of reported norovirus outbreaks and related cases resulting in the highest incidence of the virus recorded locally in public health records. Beginning in early 2010, the CCHD began to receive reports of gastrointestinal outbreaks from multiple long-term care facilities. During the four month interval from January through April 2010, 16 outbreaks were reported from 12 different long-term health care facilities. Analysis of aggregate data from the 12 institutions indicate that the overall attack rate in all outbreaks combined for residents of these sensitive facilities was 31.6% (380 ill out of a total of 1,201 persons at risk). The combined attack rate for staff was 8.1% (119 ill out of a total of 1,462 employees at all affected facilities). The range of attack rates for residents varied widely by facility, from 12.3% to 75.5%, while staff attack rates were lower, 0% to 30.8%. Testing by the Bureau of Laboratories revealed that all sampled specimens were positive for norovirus G2 virus. The average of the median duration of illness (from onset date to cessation of symptoms) from all facilities combined was 50.6 hours for residents and 39.75 hours for staff. This falls within the 24 - 72 hour expected classical clinical symptomatic range for duration of norovirus. During this four month outbreak, there were eight deaths in the effected facilities. The reported case fatality proportion for these aggregated outbreaks during this four month period was 2.1%. This case fatality proportion is near the expected value when compared with recent studies of mortality in elderly patients following norovirus infections where 30-day case fatality proportions ranged from 1.6% for those patients aged 60-69 years to 14.2% for patients aged 90 years and older. 242Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 These multiple coincident Norovirus outbreaks prompted the Epidemiology and Health Assessment Program of the CCHD to implement an aggressive targeted health education initiative for nursing, as well as other staf f of long-term care facilities in the county, on the prevention, control, and reporting of norovirus and other enteric diseases. This project, which began in 2010, will continue on an annual basis through at least 2015. Pertussis Pertussis in a Boy with Travel to a Boy Scout Camp in North Carolina, Sarasota County, July 2010On July 26, a PCR confirmed case (Case 1) of pertussis in a boy aged 1 1 years was reported to the Sarasota County Health Department (SCHD). His symptoms began on June 19 after he returned from a Boy Scout camp in North Carolina. Symptoms initially consisted of a sore throat. The boy was taken to the doctor on June 24 and was prescribed amoxicillin. Symptoms progressed to include fits of coughing and the boy was taken to the doctor again on June 29. During this visit he was given cough syrup. The boy traveled by plane to Chicago with his father sometime between June 29 and July 11, the mother was unable to recall the dates of the flights. After returning, the boy was still experiencing fits of coughing and went to the doctor on July 11. During this visit, a chest x-ray was done and the doctor diagnosed pneumonia and referred the boy to a pulmonologist. On July 21 the pulmonologist reviewed the x-ray and determined that it was not pneumonia, and taking into account the symptoms, diagnosed pertussis and ordered laboratory testing. According to the mother no other family members experienced any symptoms. The mother, father, and sister all received prophylaxis. The boy had previously received all five recommended doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Suspected exposure occurred at Boy Scout Camp A in North Carolina between June 12 and 19. During this trip the scouts slept in two-man tents and were with scouts from other regions of the country . During the investigation Bureau of Immunizations contacted the North Carolina Department of Health to notify them of the potential exposure at Camp A. In discussing this with the Scoutmaster for this troop, a second case was identified. Case 2 was in an unvaccinated boy aged 11 years who traveled with the first boy to and from Boy Scout Camp A in the same vehicle. These two boys also shared the same two-man tent while at the camp. The second boy's symptoms began on June 15 as a sore throat and general malaise. His cough began on June 23 and progressed to fits of coughing and post-cough vomiting. The second boy was initially treated with homeopathic medications and was taken to the doctor on July 1 after his cough became worse. The doctor did not perform any laboratory testing. He prescribed cephalexin for 14 days, which was completed. During the interview (July 30) the mother of the second child indicated she also was experiencing symptoms. Her symptoms began on July 12 with a sore throat and malaise. Her cough began on July 19, which progressed to fits of coughing and an episode of post-cough vomiting. She was advised to seek medical care. The mother was subsequently lost to follow-up and was not reported as a case. The grandmother of the second boy also experienced cold-like symptoms that began on July 20 and some intermittent coughing that began shortly thereafter. She was advised to seek medical care. The grandmother did not meet case definition and was not counted as a case. No additional ill contacts or family members were reported. During this outbreak control measures included: isolation of cases, initiation of proper antibiotic treatment, targeted antibiotic prophylaxis, and education on vaccine importance. Pertussis Outbreak Associated with a Residence Shelter, Duval County, August 2010 On August 17, 2010 Duval County Health Department (DCHD) Epidemiology Program was notified of two243Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 PCR-confirmed pertussis cases in siblings aged eight and nine years who resided with their family in a shelter . Onset of symptoms began on August 2 and 14, respectively. Each child had received the age-appropriate five doses of DTaP vaccine. Both children used nebulizers for periodic mild asthma symptoms. The father also developed symptoms, with an onset of July 19. The family had lived at the shelter for approximately one month. The investigation included follow-up at two shelters, three child care facilities, a summer camp (associated with a shelter), the father's supervisor at work, the secondary cases, and other close personal contacts. Eight confirmed cases were identified in the outbreak, four were PCR-positive, and four were confirmed by epidemiologic link. A PCR-positive child aged six years, who was a contact of the siblings, also had a history of five DTaP vaccinations. Control measures used for the outbreak were: notification by phone about the illness, education and preventive efforts by phone, fax, fliers and mail, and follow-up surveillance for ill persons. The Florida Bureau of Immunization provided Tdap vaccinations for further outbreak control at the shelters. No further cases associated with this outbreak were identified. Pertussis Outbreak Associated with a Local K-7 School, Sarasota County, December 2010 On December 10, 2010 the Bureau of Epidemiology reported two PCR-confirmed cases of pertussis to the Sarasota County Health Department (SCHD) on-call epidemiologist. Case A was in a boy aged 11 years and Case B was in his brother aged four years, neither of whom was vaccinated. Case A attends a K-7 school in Sarasota. The school has a population of 411 students of whom 6.1% (n=25) have a religious exemption and have partial or incomplete pertussis vaccination. Case A developed a cough on November 29 and experienced fits of coughing and post-tussive vomiting. He was taken to the doctor on December 7 and diagnosed with pertussis, and was prescribed zithromax. Case B was diagnosed with pertussis and prescribed zithromax at the same visit. During the visit, specimens were taken for laboratory testing. Prophylaxis was recommended for family members. No other contacts were identified during the interview and the parents isolated the brothers while they were sick. The school nurse at the K-7 school where case A was enrolled was notified of the case due to concerns associated with the high rate of no or incomplete vaccination among the student population. Active surveillance was initiated. A letter was drafted by SCHD and sent home with students on December 14 to notify parents of their child's potential exposure to pertussis. Cases C, D and E were identified via active surveillance. Cases C and D met the probable case definition, with cough greater than two weeks and post-tussive vomiting. Case E was identified as meeting the suspect case definition with a cough lasting less than 14 days. This last child was up-to-date on vaccinations and was lost to follow up. There was no known contact between Cases A and B, and any of the other cases. Additionally, there is no known contact between cases C, D, and E. Case C and D were seen by their provider and neither was tested for pertussis. Winter break began on December the 20 and ended December 31. No cases were identified after the break. During this outbreak disease control measures included, exclusion of cases from school, parental education, targeted post exposure prophylaxis and immunization, and active surveillance. Salmonellosis Salmonella Anatum Associated with a Wedding Reception, Sumter County, April 2010On April 19, 2010 the Sumter County Health Department and the Regional Environmental Epidemiologist for North Central Florida were notified of a cluster of Gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses following a244Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 wedding reception in Sumter County. The reception was hosted at a community center in Lake Panasoffkee on April 17 at 5:00 pm. Approximately 68 guests attended the dinner. A list of names and telephone numbers of reception attendees was obtained. The outbreak case definition included attendees who developed either diarrhea or vomiting within 72 hours of attending the reception. Both ill and non-ill persons were interviewed using the standardized food and waterborne outbreak questionnaire to assess food and other exposure histories. A food-specific section of the questionnaire was designed based on the menu of items served at the event. Symptoms reported by the 37 ill attendees included: diarrhea (100%), abdominal cramps (97%), fatigue (89%), sweating muscle (56%), dizziness (38%), and numbness or tingling sensation (8%). A mean incubation period of 21 hours (median=18.5 hours, range=9.5-67 hours) was reported. The mean duration of illness was 57 hours (median=57.5, range=9-120 hours). In total, 15 (41% of the total) attendees received medical treatment for their symptoms. Six specimens were collected from ill persons and shipped to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville (BOL) for both enteric and viral testing. An additional seventh sample was tested by a private laboratory after an attendee was hospitalized. Food samples of left-over meats (pork and chicken) were shipped in sterile plastic bags to BOL and tested for Staphylococcus aureus , Clostridium perfingens, Salmonella species , and Bacillus cereus. All six human stool samples submitted to the BOL tested positive for Salmonella Anatum. The two food samples submitted (chicken and pork) also tested positive for Salmonella Anatum. These isolates had a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern identical to that observed in the six human samples. One additional stool sample tested positive for Salmonella at a private laboratory, but was not tested at BOL. Due to the receipt of a positive laboratory result in both the chicken and pork and the potential for cross contamination to occur during preparation, it was unknown which meat was the primary source of the Salmonella Anatum. Statistical analysis gathered through epidemiologic interviews indicated that the pork and baked beans were statistically associated with illness. The environmental assessment and interview with the chef who prepared the chicken and pork identified several practices and procedures that may have compromised food safety such as cross-contamination of the chicken and pork and time-temperature abuse. Shigellosis Shigella sonnei Outbreak at a Mexican Restaurant, Alachua County, August 2010 In August 2010, the Alachua County Health Department (ACHD), Regional Environmental Epidemiologist (REE), and Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) received multiple illness complaints from several unrelated parties who dined at the same Mexican restaurant in Alachua County . A total of 36 restaurant patrons were identified from four separate parties who dined at the restaurant on either August 9 or 10. A total of 18 were reported ill, of whom 15 were interviewed. Fourteen ill patrons dined at the restaurant during the same two-hour period on August 9 and the other four dined on August 10. An outbreak case definition was developed, which included patrons who dined at the restaurant from August 7-10, 2010 and developed illness with diarrhea and/or vomiting within 72 hours. All 15 patrons interviewed met the case definition for the outbreak. Symptoms reported included: diarrhea 100% (15), fever 100% (15), cramps 87% (13), fatigue 87% (13), weakness 80% (12), chills 80% (12), nausea 73% (1 1), sweating 73% (11), headache 67% (10), bloody diarrhea 67% (10), vomiting 40% (6), and dizziness 40% (6). Five persons received medical treatment. The mean duration of illness was 174 hours or seven days (range=120-240). A 245Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 mean incubation period of 46 hours was reported (range= 25-67). Five patrons tested positive for Shigella sonnei, two patrons had their specimens tested at the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville, and three by a private laboratory. The ACHD, DBPR, and REE conducted a joint environmental assessment at the restaurant. Several food safety violations were identified and reported to management, such as temperature abuse in a freezer , cross- contamination of raw and ready-to-eat chicken, and poor employee hand-washing practices. Employees reported that the freezer was defrosting throughout the day and a subsequent repair of a crack in the condenser was completed. The unit was not permitted to be used until it was fully repaired. In addition, one wait-staff employee, who also works at a day-care center, reported having recent GI symptoms but denied preparing food or working during the dates when the cases visited the restaurant. The restaurant's manager was required to enforce the restaurant's sick leave policy and restrict employees from working while ill and 72 hours after their symptoms resolved. The manager was instructed to reduce the risk of cross-contamination by enforcing that grill cooks use separate utensils for cooking raw and ready-to-eat foods. Management was asked to observe staff hand-washing practices, enforce effective hand hygiene, and required to repair the freezer unit. A second joint environmental assessment was conducted to ensure that all requests were completed. Shigellosis Outbreak Associated with a Daycare Facility, Hendry County, August 2010 On August 3, 2010 the Hendry County Health Department (HCHD) received an electronic laboratory report positive for Shigella sonnei in a child aged five years. The HCHD epidemiology program launched an investigation that revealed the patient attended a local daycare center during the week prior to illness and had been sent home on July 24 with diarrhea and abdominal pain. This information prompted a visit to the daycare facility to make an assessment, educate, and implement appropriate control measures. The facility's investigation led to the identification of five (16%) students and one (17%) staff member in two separate classrooms who were symptomatic between July 23 and August 3. The director of the facility had sent a letter to parents on July 26 informing them of a circulating diarrheal illness and advised them to \"keep children home if they exhibit stomach flu-like illness.\" The health department had not been notified prior to the letter being sent. On August 3, 2010 HCHD recommended implementation of Phase 1 interventions from the Guidelines for Control of Outbreaks of Enteric Disease in Childcare Settings , including exclusion and readmission criteria, personal and environmental control measures, and issued a letter notifying parents of Shigella at the day care center. The HCHD blast-faxed an advisory to community health care providers and partners. The Early Learning Coalition of Southwest Florida and the Bureau of Epidemiology were notified of the outbreak. On August 4, 2010 the Hendry County Environmental and Epidemiology programs conducted a joint inspection of the facility. Overall, the facility was clean and the administration was cooperative. Daily surveillance was conducted until the outbreak was contained and Phase 1 interventions were lifted on August 18. Ultimately, there were seven cases among students and staff at the facility and five cases among contacts. One person was hospitalized for severe illness and recovered. Shigella sonnei Outbreak Investigation at a Local Daycare Center, Osceola County, July-August 2010 On Monday August 16, 2010 the Osceola County Health Department (OCHD) was notified of two confirmed Shigella sonnei cases in children. The first confirmed case was in a boy aged six years who had onset of symptoms on August 11 and experienced abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. A local urgent care facility246Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 diagnosed otitis media. However, as symptoms persisted the child was taken to the emergency room and admitted for appendicitis. Later, stool culture confirmed Shigella sonnei . Interviewing the parent revealed the child attended daycare and two other household members were also symptomatic. One of the symptomatic contacts was a boy aged three years who attends the same daycare. His symptom onset was August 8. The second confirmed case was in a boy aged one year who had onset of symptoms on August 7 and experienced low grade fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. The child also attends the same daycare center. One of this boy's siblings, a boy aged six years, was also symptomatic starting on August 16. The mother was interviewed and confirmed onset dates, and the last day of attendance at the daycare center was August 16. She also reported her neighbor's daughter who also attends the same daycare center had been symptomatic. Upon interviewing the neighbor, it was found that three children in that home (aged two, three, and four years) had been symptomatic, and all three attend the same daycare center . Their symptom onsets were from July 29 through August 1. Reported symptoms of gastrointestinal illness included diarrhea (100%), abdominal pain (43%), vomiting (71%), and fever (57%). An environmental investigation was performed on August 18. The daycare center's kitchen, restrooms, sinks, and all classrooms were inspected. Recommendations were offered, including implementation of Phase 1 interventions from Guidelines for Control of Outbreaks of Enteric Disease in Childcare Settings ; issuing a letter notifying parents of Shigella at the daycare center, ongoing investigation, and contact tracing. Staphylococcus aureus Three Staphylococcus aureus Deaths, Palm Beach County, September-October 2010The Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD) Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control investigated three unrelated cases of community-associated Staphylococcus aureus mortality that occurred within a two-month period from September to October, 2010. Only one of the three was a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) infection. The first case was reported to PBCHD on September 1, from a hospital in the central part of the county . The case was a woman aged 55 years who became ill on August 19. She was seen at a local emergency department for back pain, diagnosed with sciatic nerve pain, and discharged with pain medication. She was admitted to a different hospital on August 29 in respiratory failure and septic shock. A chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus . Resistance testing demonstrated resistance to oxacillin and penicillin confirming this was a MRSA infection. Specimens sent to the Bureau of Laboratories confirmed the hospital laboratory results. No viral tests were conducted and the patient died August 30. The second case reported was in a woman aged 82 years. This case was reported by a hospital in the southern part of the county on October 29. The patient became ill on August 15 and was treated for a urinary tract infection. She was admitted to the hospital on August 29, after being found unresponsive that morning. Blood specimens obtained that same day were positive for Staphylococcus aureus which was resistant to penicillin and sensitive to oxacillin. A urine culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae . No viral testing was conducted. The patient was admitted to a hospice unit on September 2, and died on September 5. No specimens were available for confirmatory testing at the Bureau of Laboratories. The third case was in a girl aged 15 years living in the northern part of the county . This case was reported to PBCHD on November 2. She had onset of fever, vomiting, headaches, and upper respiratory infection symptoms on October 19. She was found the morning of the 22 with seizures and admitted to a local hospital. A respiratory specimen collected October 23 from her endotracheal tube was positive for Beta-hemolytic247Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Streptococcus group F and Staphylococcus aureus . The Staphylococcus aureus isolate was sensitive to all antibiotics tested. She died October 30. Testing did confirm the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the respiratory specimen. Family interviews revealed that none of these patients had a history of known Staphylococcus colonization or skin infection in the past. None of the cases had a history of activities with a high risk of impairment of skin integrity. Streptococcal Disease Strep Throat and Scarlet Fever in a Child Care Facility, Hillsborough County, May 2010On May 25, 2010 the Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) was notified of an outbreak of streptococcal throat infections (\"strep throat\") in a childcare facility . Four children, aged three to five years, were reported by the facility to have strep throat. One child was diagnosed by a physician with a positive rapid strep test. Another child had a diagnosis of strep throat and \"scarlatina\" (scarlet fever). Initially, information on strep throat, scarlet fever, and basic sanitation recommendations for childcare were provided to the facility. In addition, a letter was sent to the parents and a door sign was posted at the center. The childcare facility was advised to discontinue family style dining for the duration of the outbreak. As of June 6, no new cases had been reported and the investigation was considered complete. On June 24th, one month after the initial report, HCHD was notified of new cases of strep throat at the same facility. One child was diagnosed with strep throat and had a rash. Two other children had sore throats. Because of the new cases, HCDH sent epidemiologists to conduct a site visit on June 29, 2010. Observations from this visit noted that door signs and parent letters were visible. The center was using bleach to clean. Water tables and sand tables were available and in use. Play dough was in use. Children's toothbrushes were kept by the hand washing sink. HCHD recommended frequent hand washing. HCHD also recommended surveillance for new cases of strep throat and the prompt removal of ill children. Children who had strep throat would only be readmitted after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy . Family-style dining was suspended until two incubation periods (eight days) after the last case of strep throat. T oys and high touch items were cleaned with a bleach solution and the use of water tables, sand tables, and toys that could not be sanitized were discontinued. In addition, careful consideration was given to the use of toothbrushes at the facility. Given the high number of cases and the long duration of the outbreak, it was recommended to throw away all toothbrushes in the affected classrooms, disinfect the toothbrush holder, and reissue new toothbrushes to all children. HCDH recommended toothbrushes belonging to children with sore throats be thrown away immediately and a new one issued when the child returns. There were nine cases with a diagnosis of strep throat and five cases with sore throat or rash, which were considered suspect cases. The first onset date was May 23, 2010 and the last case's onset date was July 7, 2010. The attack rate was 20% (14 of 70) in the children and 0% (0 of 10) in the staff. Prior to this investigation, HCHD was not aware of the use of toothbrushes in childcare facilities or the need to address this practice. After the enhanced recommendations were provided, only one additional case of sore throat was reported. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis Cluster at a Homeless Shelter and Day Center, Duval County, 2010-2011The Duval County Health Department (DCHD) Tuberculosis (TB) program is currently managing a cluster of248Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 several individuals with ties to a local homeless shelter who were confirmed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease. In a retrospective review, the initial person in the cluster was a man aged 54 years diagnosed on August 28, 2010. On September 10, 2010, a man aged 51 years had a positive culture for M. tuberculosis . A third individual was a man aged 50 years (later determined to be from the same shelter) who was hospitalized and had a positive culture on October 28, 2010 for M. tuberculosis . As of February 11, 2011 there were nine confirmed cases with a genotyping and/or epidemiological connection to the shelter. Because of the evidence of possible on-going transmission, an active case-finding event was held on February 22-23. The main objectives of the case-finding event were to detect active cases of TB and identify individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI). During the event, the Bureau of Tuberculosis and Refugee Health first used the GeneXpert machine, which is a fully contained nucleic acid detection system. A portable x-ray machine was also available onsite to optimize use of the TB teleradiology system, as well as latent TB infection testing by Inteferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). There were a total of 212 individuals screened for TB at the shelter during the active event. One active case of TB was detected. The evaluation of the additional TB suspects and individuals with LTBI is currently on-going. The Bureau of Tuberculosis and Refugee Health is working with DCHD to implement a long-range action plan to address this issue in the community. Tuberculosis in an Elephant, Seminole County, August 2010 On August 26, 2010 the Seminole County Health Department (SCHD) was notified of a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture obtained from lung tissue as part of a necropsy conducted on an elephant that died on July 29, 2010. The report originated from the local U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service representative, who contacted the Bureau of Environmental Public Health Medicine, and was ultimately received at SCHD by both the Tuberculosis and Refugee Health Program and the Epidemiology Program. Although the animal died while in a zoo in Massachusetts, it was also exhibited at a flea market in Seminole County from November 17, 2009 to March 31, 2010, as well as during previous winters for the past several years. The elephant's three local handlers had been tested annually for tuberculosis by the SCHD TB program since 2003, and the results were consistently negative, including the last test performed on February 23, 2010. The animal's Florida veterinarian was tested on September 8 and that result was also negative. State health departments in Massachusetts and Maryland followed up with the elephant' s handlers who had moved to those states in the interim. Because the highest risk group, the handlers and veterinarian, was negative for TB, the risk for others was deemed minimal and no additional contact tracing was required. Typhoid Fever Typhoid Fever Imported from Haiti in a Food Handler, Miami-Dade County, April 2010The Miami-Dade County Health Department (MDCHD), Epidemiology, Disease Control and Immunization Services (EDC-IS) investigated a typhoid fever case in a man aged 35 years. The man was seen at a local hospital emergency department on April 27, 2010 with fever and headache, which began on April 22. He was discharged on April 28, and instructed to follow-up at a local medical center within 7-10 days. Initially, the patient could not be contacted. According to the hospital emergency department notes, the patient is a possible food handler with recent travel to Haiti. Additional resources were used to gather patient demographics and place of employment. Those searches indicated the man was a kitchen supervisor at a local restaurant. Staff at the restaurant reported the man did work there but his last day of work, as well as his future date of return was not known at that time. 249Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 The infection was acquired in Haiti. Great efforts were required to locate the man to assure he completed the antibiotic treatment. In total, 69 employees of the restaurant were tested with three stool cultures each. An additional four household contacts were also tested. All results were negative for Salmonella Typhi. Typhoid Fever in a Return Traveler from India, Hillsborough County, June 2010On June 6, 2010 the Hillsborough County Health Department (HCHD) was notified of a possible typhoid fever case in a man aged 31 years. HCHD interviewed the hospitalized patient on June 7, 2010. The patient traveled to India on May 14 and stayed with family until returning home on May 31. On June 3, he developed fever, chills, watery diarrhea, and body pain. Later that day he visited an urgent care clinic where he was diagnosed with a sinus infection, prescribed Ciprofloxacin, and sent home. When symptoms continued the next day, he went to the emergency department, where blood and stool samples were collected. He was sent home. On June 5 symptoms worsened; he returned to the emergency department and was admitted. Previously collected blood cultures were positive for Gram negative rods identified as Salmonella Typhi. These samples were forwarded to the Bureau of Laboratories - Jacksonville where S. Typhi Group D1 was confirmed. The stool samples were negative. He remained hospitalized from June 5-1 1 with ongoing high fever and diarrhea. On June 25, the man tested negative for S. Typhi in blood and stool cultures. The patient recovered fully. The patient had not been vaccinated for typhoid fever prior to travel. While in India, he reported eating local foods and drinking untreated water. He did not recall any contact with sick people. The patient did not attend work or have any contact with anyone in sensitive situations. He did not go outside the home while ill for any purpose other than to seek medical attention. The patient's wife and child aged two years did not travel to India and were not in sensitive situations. The wife was six months pregnant at the time of interview and was advised to follow up with her physician. No family member or contacts became ill. The family was provided information and educated on prevention and transmission. West Nile Virus West Nile Virus in an Asymptomatic Blood Donor, Osceola County, July 2010On July 29, 2010 the Osceola County Health Department (OCHD) Epidemiology Program received a positive laboratory result for West Nile Virus (WNV) from Florida's Blood Bank Center for a man aged 46 years. The sample was collected on July 15 from a bloodmobile at a resort in Osceola County . When the donor was interviewed, it was found he works cleaning the pool at a local hotel. During his work, he is exposed to mosquitoes. He does not use chemical repellants or other protection from mosquitoes. He recalled a large number of mosquitoes being active in and around the pool area. The patient reported no travel history during the past two months. The man was asymptomatic so the case does not meet case criteria to be reported in Merlin. Osceola County had a positive WNV result in a horse the previous week and Orange County had several sentinel chicken flocks that tested positive for WNV. A Health Advisory was issued to remind the public that mosquito activity is ongoing. Neuroinvasive West Nile Cases, Orange County, August 2010 On August 5, 2010 Orange County Health Department (OCHD) received a positive West Nile Virus (WNV) IgM laboratary result from a local hospital on a male Orange County resident aged 40 years. Orange County Mosquito Control was contacted on August 6 for mosquito management. The man had no significant medical history and was a smoker and recreational drug user. According to the man's wife, he did not travel out of Florida during the incubation period of 2 to 14 days. The man did have some outdoor exposure in Orlando and St. Cloud. 250Section 5: Notable Outbreaks & Case Investigations 2010 Osceola County Health Department was notified of the St. Cloud address on August 13. The man's wife stated he did not recall any mosquito bites. The man had developed non-specific symptoms on July 22 including malaise, wheezing, and congestion. On July 23, the man complained of body and muscle aches. The following day he developed a high fever (103\u00b0F) with rigors, stiff neck, and severe headache. He also became disoriented, lethargic, and had severe weakness. On July 25, the man's mental status altered and he became aphasic, or unable to speak. His fever reached 105\u00b0F. He developed some facial droop, and bladder/bowel incontinence with lower extremity paralysis. The patient was admitted to the local hospital intensive care unit (ICU) on July 26 and was initially diagnosed with meningitis. Later, he was diagnosed with sepsis. Encephalitis and stroke were ruled out. After the positive WNV IgM result, the man was diagnosed with WNV encephalitis. On August 20, WNV was confirmed by a positive IgM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the Bureau of Laboratories - T ampa. On August 23 OCHD issued a Mosquito-borne Illness Advisory to the public. The patient spent several months recovering at a rehabilitation facility. He had significant speech and vision deficits. He also suffered from lower extremity nerve damage causing difficulties with mobility. On September 1, 2010 OCHD received a second positive West Nile Virus (WNV) IgM laboratary result from a local hospital, on a male resident of Orange County aged 80 years. Orange County Mosquito Control was contacted on September 1 for mosquito management. The patient had an extensive medical history including coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft, cancer , diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In spite of the medical history , the man seemed to be in good health prior to this illness. According to the man's wife, he did not travel out of Orange County during the incubation period. The man spent time outdoors daily, and the wife could not recall him having any mosquito bites. The man developed symptoms around the second week of August (illness onset approximated as August 8). He had high fever, chills, body aches, sweats, headache, and malaise. The man's symptoms worsened prior to hospital admission with progressive weakness, lethargy, difficulty walking, nausea, and anorexia. He was admitted to the ICU at a local hospital on August 22. On August 23, the man's mental status became altered and he was unable to speak or move. The man was initially diagnosed with possible pneumonia due to a cough, but the chest x-ray did not support this diagnosis. Additionally , this symptom may have been a normal finding due to the patient's history of COPD. After the positive WNV IgM was received, the man was diagnosed with WNV encephalitis. The patient died on September 4 at the local hospital. On September 7, WNV was confirmed by a positive IgM in CSF by the BOL - Tampa. On September 7, OCHD issued a Mosquito-borne Illness alert to the public.

The FCDS is administered by the Florida Department of Health Bureau of Epidemiology and operated by the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine. The FCDS began operation with a pilot project for cancer registration in 1980 and commenced statewide collection of cancer incidence data from all Florida hospitals in 1981. The FCDS now collects incidence data from hospitals, freestanding ambulatory surgical centers, radiation therapy facilities, pathology laboratories, and private physician offices. Each facility, laboratory, and practitioner is required to report the FCDS within six months of each diagnosis and within six months of the date of each treatment. Consequently , there is an inherent time lag in the release of cancer registry data for surveillance activities. During 2008, physicians diagnosed 105,207 primary cancers among Floridians, an average of 288 cases per day. Cancer occurs predominantly among older people as age is the top risk factor for developing disease. Approximately 59% of the newly diagnosed cancers in 2008 occurred in persons aged 65 years and older; this age group accounts for 18% of Florida's population. The four most common cancers in Floridians were lung and bronchus (16,339 cases), prostate (14,391 cases), female breast (13,749 cases), and colorectal (10,199 cases), which accounted for 52% of all new cases in Florida. Fifty-three percent of new cancers were diagnosed in males. The number of new cancer cases in Florida's five most populous counties (Broward, Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Palm Beach, and Pinellas) accounted for 39% of the new cancer cases in Florida. Over the 28-year period from 1981 to 2008, males had a higher incidence (age-adjusted incidence rate) than females. Among blacks, the incidence among males was between 55% and 102% higher than that among females, depending on the cancer site of comparison. Among whites, the incidence among males was between 28% and 53% higher than that among females. White females had higher age-adjusted incidence rates than black females in all 28 years. The racial disparity varied between 10% and 27%. Black males had higher age-adjusted incidence rates than white males in all years, except in 1987, 1988, and 2006. The racial disparity between black and white males increased from 1989 until 1995; however , this has steadily declined since 1996. More information about the burden of cancer in Florida is provided in the Florida Annual Cancer Report, an epidemiological series, available on the department's website Cancer Data, 2008 Table 1.

BOL also collects epidemiologic and demographic information to support the core public health functions of the Florida Department of Health (FDOH). T echnical services, based upon evolving community requirements, include screening and confirmation tests for: biological and chemical threats and disease outbreak investigations; sexually transmitted diseases; tuberculosis; and parasitology . Accurate and timely laboratory data are critical to support informed public health decisions. BOL also provides training to healthcare providers and laboratory scientists; tests samples from potable, environmental, and recreational water sources, pollution spills, and suspect contaminated foods; and certifies environmental and water testing laboratories. BOL provides laboratory screening of all newborns in the state for 34 genetic disorders, which, without detection and early treatment, can lead to death or severe physical and mental disabilities. BOL supports all 67 county health departments, other Department of Health programs, physicians, hospitals, and numerous state and federal agencies, by providing public health diagnostic, screening and reference laboratory services. Centennial Anniversary of Tampa and Pensacola Branch Laboratories The Florida Legislature established the State Board of Health in 1889, which was located in Jacksonville. In 1903, the Legislature established the State Public Health Laboratory, also located in Jacksonville. Seven years later, in 1910, the Tampa and the Pensacola Laboratories were established. Like the Jacksonville Laboratory, the Pensacola and Tampa Laboratories were responsible for providing diagnostic testing to the State Board of Health and to private physicians. With three laboratories up and running, the Bureau of Laboratories was able to provide vital services to what were then the most populous areas of Florida. The Miami Laboratory was established in 1914 and the Tallahassee Laboratory in 1915. The latter closed in 1917, was re-opened in 1921, and closed permanently in 1992. The Orlando Laboratory was opened in 1948 and operated until 1992. Lastly, West Palm Beach/Lantana was opened in 1953 in the basement at the A.G. Holley State Tuberculosis Hospital and since 1982, has had its own separate building on the campus. The Lantana Laboratory was closed in September 2011. On April 8, 2010 approximately 100 people, including current and former employees, former DOH Secretary Robert Brooks, and former Deputy State Health Officer Rick Hunter , gathered to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Tampa Public Health Laboratory. Dr. Doug Holt, Director of the Hillsborough County Health Department, read a proclamation from Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio. Public health professionals, legislators, and education leaders from across the Florida Panhandle met on June 17, 2010 at the J. Earle Bowden Building in Historic Pensacola Village to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Public Health Laboratory in Pensacola. Today's laboratory, located at 50 West Maxwell Street, traces its roots back to 1910 when the City of Pensacola presented a request to the State Board of Health that a laboratory be established to provide diagnostic screening to the State Board of Health and to private physicians. The first laboratory was located in City Hall which is now the T. T. Wentworth Museum. In attendance at the celebration were Representative Dave Murzin, Mr . Ray W alker, Aide for Representative Clay Ford, Billy Sasser from Department of Homeland Security, and Dr. John Parker, the Pensacola Laboratory Director from 1989-2006. Speakers at the event were Dr. Kristina Behan of the University of West Florida's Clinical Laboratory Sciences Department and Dr. Susan Turner, Associate Director of the Escambia County Health Department. A congratulatory letter from Governor Crist was read aloud. 281Section 8: Public Health Laboratory Status Report Brucella species Together with the Bureau of Environmental Public Health Medicine and the Bureau of Epidemiology, the BOL-Jacksonville, BOL-Tampa and BOL-Pensacola were involved in analysis for several cases of brucellosis. Historically, there are five to six cases of brucellosis in Florida each year. However, in 2010 there were nine cases in Florida residents. In addition, the BOL also tested specimens from two other cases: one Alabama resident and one visitor from Nicaragua. In total, the BOL identified 14 Brucella species from these 11 cases: nine Brucella suis , three B. melitensis, and two B. abortus. Due in part to more stringent select agent reporting criteria, an actual increase in the number of brucellosis cases, as well as a lack of timely recognition of Brucella in the clinical laboratories, there has been a large increase in potential exposures to Brucella species in clinical diagnostic laboratory personnel since sometimes these organisms are worked on without adequate precautions. Despite the recent increase in cases, Brucella species remain rarely seen pathogens in the clinical laboratory and automated identification systems often misidentify them or report a result with a low degree of confidence. As such, these isolates tend to be forwarded to more sophisticated diagnostic laboratories for identification as an \"unknown organism\", potentially exposing a greater number of laboratory workers. An unfortunate example of this occurred in August 2009 when a hospital microbiology laboratory in Hillsborough County sent a culture to a diagnostic reference laboratory in Florida, which then sent the culture to a reference laboratory in North Carolina where it was finally suspected to be a Brucella species. The culture was sent to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services laboratory, where it was determined to be Brucella species by real-time PCR. As the patient was a Florida resident, the isolate was forwarded to BOL-Jacksonville where it was identified as Brucella suis. Several personnel at the clinical laboratories were exposed to the organism and unfortunately one microbiologist developed brucellosis resulting in a B. suis positive blood culture. The total number of laboratorians exposed to Brucella species from these cases was 85 (75 high risk exposures and 10 low risk). Exposed personnel underwent extensive medical evaluation involving a minimum of 21 days prophylaxis and serological monitoring up to 24 weeks post-exposure. Dengue Update The Bureau of Laboratories Virology sections in Tampa and Jacksonville have performed serological assays for the detection of antibodies to dengue virus for many years. Few specimens are tested annually for this rare disease. Nevertheless, this virus causes significant problems worldwide. Because of a study performed in the Tampa laboratory by Dr. Julia Gill in 1996-1997, demonstrating higher rates of imported dengue than previously suspected, molecular assays for detection of dengue virus RNA were developed at the BOL. During 2009, the BOL began development and validation of a real-time RT-PCR molecular assay for dengue. This assay is faster and capable of analyzing more specimens than the traditional gel-based assay . The BOL also has the capability to perform genetic sequencing to assess relationships of various specimens. When dengue virus appeared in Key West in 2009, BOL-Tampa was able to detect the virus in local mosquitoes and show that it was the same strain detected in locally acquired human cases. During 2010, over 610 serological assays on 332 clinical sera were performed at the BOL V irology units in Tampa and Jacksonville for dengue confirmation, compared to 127 assays on 70 sera in 2009 and 13 assays on eight sera in 2008. IgM antibody indicating a recent infection was detected in 98 sera in 2010, 23 in 2009 and four in 2008. BOL-Tampa Virology has performed PCR assays on all acute (less than five days post onset of symptoms) specimens submitted for dengue testing, in addition to IgM and IgG serological assays; 182 acute sera from 17 Florida counties have been tested by PCR to date. Dengue virus RNA was detected in 53 patient sera. However, 19 of these cases had not yet developed IgM antibody to dengue and would have been considered negative had molecular assays not been performed. Virus types detected included 36 dengue type 1, 12 Dengue type 2, three dengue type 3 and three dengue type 4. Genetic sequencing confirmed 282Section 8: Public Health Laboratory Status Report virus strains detected from all Key West cases are the same, indicating continued indigenous transmission. This heightened surveillance effort has detected two other instances of locally acquired transmission in two additional counties: dengue 3 in Broward and dengue 2 in Miami-Dade. Genetic sequencing analysis of the detected additional strains aids in determining whether the virus continues to be transmitted, and to date, additional cases related to the Broward and Miami-Dade cases have not been detected. Biological Defense Program The 2010 Laboratory Response Network (LRN) National Meeting Planning Committee selected the FDOH BOL to be the recipient of the \"Excellence in Partnership\" award for building strong working relationships with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the University of South Florida Center for Biological Defense, and hundreds of sentinel (hospital/commercial) laboratories. BOL established the Advanced Capacity Hospital Laboratory Network for Florida, trained of first responders, and authored the State of Florida Comprehensive Laboratory Response Plan, which has been used as a model for similar plans around the nation. BOL-Jacksonville and BOL-Pensacola were two of ten laboratories nationwide that participated in a Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention (CDC) Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections study entitled \"Determination of Clinical Specificity of Laboratory Response Network Real-T ime PCR Assays Using Leftover Unlinked Human Specimens\". The objective of the study was to determine the clinical specificity for selected LRN real-time PCR assays and demonstrate that routine human specimens will not generate false positive results, thereby increasing the confidence in positive results generated during an actual or suspect bioterrorism event. Almost 3,000 real-time PCR reactions were performed anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei on 100 throat or nasopharyngeal swabs and 30 pleural fluids submitted from local hospital laboratory partners. No false positive results were obtained. BOL-Jacksonville and BOL-Tampa were invited and participated in the development of a Department of Homeland Security BioWatch Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP). The purpose of the QAPP is to increase confidence in all aspects of laboratory procedures in the BioW atch program and provide public health laboratory directors nationwide with sound data necessary for decision-making in the event of a BioW atch Actionable Result. LabWare Enhancements In March 2010 BOL upgraded the LabWare Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to include functionality that enables the BOL to create and send electronic orders and to receive electronic results from outside laboratories. This functionality can be used to send samples to other public health laboratories for laboratory surge capacity testing. By adding this capability, BOL can help ensure that laboratory testing services for Floridians can be sustained during large outbreaks or in the aftermath of natural disasters. Newborn Screening Dried Blood Spot Retention Policy The 6-month retention policy for Newborn Screening dried blood spots was approved and signed by the State Surgeon General on December 13, 2010. Previously there had been no official retention policy and dried blood spots were retained on space available basis. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID) Severe Combined Immunideficiency Disease (SCID), also known as Bubble Boy Disease, is a treatable illness in which an infant fails to develop a normal immune system. After successful treatment, infants with SCID can lead a normal life. The Genetic Testing and Newborn Screening Advisory Council endorsed the SCID as the next marker to be implemented. 283Section 8: Public Health Laboratory Status Report 2009 Newborn Screening Morbidity Data The Bureau of Laboratories, in collaboration with FDOH Children Medical Services, manages the newborn screening program for Florida and screens for all disorders recommended by the Secretary' s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) with additional tests including cystic fibrosis, totaling 35 diseases and conditions (hearing included).
