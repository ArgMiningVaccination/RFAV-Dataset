The company, a subsidiary of Jubilant Pharma Limited, has entered an agreement with Pennsylvania-based biopharmaceutical company Ocugen to manufacture Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in India, Jubilant announced Tuesday. Ocugen is codeveloping Covaxin with Bharat Biotech for the U.S. market.

Gabriel, senior vice president of manufacturing and supply chain for Ocugen, said in Tuesday's announcement. Ocugen previously announced discussions have started with Health Canada for regulatory approval after the company secured exclusive rights to market the vaccine in the country.
