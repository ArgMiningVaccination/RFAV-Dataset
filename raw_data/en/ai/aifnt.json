One of my favourite topics, as I myself suffer with a thyroid disorder. My journey to healing has been widely experimental and I have found great success in treating myself as well as many patients using Homeopathy. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Why is it such a common disease these days? We look at thyroid conditions in detail to find why there is a dysfunction in the thyroid gland. We also look at a holistic approach to the thyroid being a master gland that affects every part of the body- hair, skin, energy levels and gut health. Tune in on The Home Channel DSTV Channel 176 this week at the following times: Mon 18:00 | Tue 23:00 | Wed 10:00 | Thu 14:00 | Sat 09:30 | Sun 08:00 This morning's smoothie experiment was successful! I used apple, pineapple, spinach, beetroot, ginger and coconut milk. The humble apple is high in fibre and vitamin C. Pineapple is loaded with Vitamin C and has a very cool enzyme- Bromelain- which acts as an anti- mucolytic. Spinach is rich in micronutrients such as folate and zinc. Beetroot has powerful anti inflammatory properties and that beautiful red pigment provides tons of anti- oxidant phytonutrients. Ginger is anti inflammatory and warming for winter, and coconut milk is rich in good fat, dairy free and adds some silky creaminess to this mix. It turned out to be a very delicious mix, and my body was like-' Yessss! Thank you!'. The Nutribullet has been my knight in shining armour, especially in the time and texture category. The recipe is below: Ingredients: 1/2 cup of red apple 1/2 cup of pineapple 2 spinach leaves 1 raw small beetroot 3 tablespoons of coconut milk 2 cm stick of fresh ginger water for consistency Method: Throw everything into the double cup attachment, with water. Blitz. Serve and enjoy! It should make about 600ml of deliciousness. Last week Sunday I had the most serendipitous encounter with a fabulous Nutribullet. I have ALWAYS wanted one, so I feel very blessed to have won it! I attended a seminar, and won this beautiful machine as well as two delicious medical food shakes! I made my first simple and easy smoothie this morning. I could not believe how fast this little thing goes. In 30 seconds, I had a delicious smooth drink, ready for the road. I love having smoothies for breakfast. They're quick, easy and convenient for a busy morning breakfast. I wanted to share a quick and easy smoothie recipe: Ingredients: 1/2 green apple 1/2 golden pear 1/2 large banana 2 medium sized spinach leaves 1 scoop of Metagenics/ Amipro Ultrameal Original Water for consistency Method: Place everything in the Nutribullet double cup Blitz for 30 seconds Pour into a cup and drink! That's how easy it is. If you have the opportunity of owning one of these- please do! Invest in your health and your body will thank you. On Real Health this week, I mentioned a traditional South Indian soup that has been my go-to for winter sniffles. In Tamil, Rassam means \"juice\". It can refer to any juice, but rassam is commonly referred to as a soup prepared with tamarind with spices and garnish. It has a savoury and spicy taste, which is pungent and flavourful. It is my all time favourite when I feel a sore throat coming on, or if I'm already sick with a cold or cough. All the tangy spices clear up the sinuses super quick, and allow for some inner warming when ill Ingredients: 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 cloves of garlic 2 medium size dried red chilli 1 sprig of curry leaf 1/2 thinly sliced onion 2 teaspoons of cumin seeds 1 teaspoon of black pepper corn 2 teaspoons of toasted mustard seed 1.5 teaspoons of salt 2 tablespoons of tamarind paste (I used the Tamicon brand) 3 cups of boiled water 6 sprigs of fresh coriander Method: Heat the oil in a medium sized pot (heat number 4 on the stove), and add the sliced onion. You'll want to fry this until they are golden- dark brown. In a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, cumin, black pepper and mustard seed and crush to a medium texture. Once the onions have browned, add the spice mix, curry leaves, and break up the red chilli into 1cm pieces and let it all fry for about 2-3 minutes. In a bowl, add the two tablespoons of tamarind paste, and to that, add two cups of boiled hot water. Stir the paste until it dissolves fully. Now, slowly add this tamarind water to the pot of spices and reduce the heat to 3 on your stove. Add the salt and another cup of boiling water to the pot, and let it simmer for another 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped coriander. It does taste better after a few hours. Best served plain- pour a quarter cup into a mug and sip slowly. Make sure to eat all the spices! That is the medicinal part. Another traditional variation is and serve hot over steamed rice and pan fried crispy potato. Perfect for winter! This morning I had a delicious smoothie, that I thought I have to share. I know many people cringe at the thought of putting veggies into a smoothie... It is the only way to reap the full benefit of a raw meal! Veggies (as well as fibre) stabilise the blood sugar levels, as opposed to just a fruit based smoothie. This recipe makes one litre. I usually have 500ml for breakfast and reserve the other half for the next day or an after gym meal. Ingredients: Serving size: 1 litre ( or 2x green fibre ) 1 teaspoon turmeric powder (anti-inflammatory) 1/4 cucumber (fibre and potassium) 1/2 cup grapes (anti- oxidant and adds natural sweetness) 1 golden delicious apple (fibre and adds natural sweetness) 3 tablespoons of plain full cream organic yoghurt (good fat and protein, probiotic boost and also adds creamy texture) 3 tablespoons pomegranite seeds (high in vitamin B & C, fibre and sweetness) 1 cup spinach leaves (high vitamin A and lots of green insoluble fibre) Water for consistency Method: Rinse and roughly chop up the fruit and vegetables De-seed the apple and grapes Chuck everything into a liquidiser/ smoothie maker and switch on Add water gradually for desired consistency. I prefer a liquid like consistency that I can drink easily Make sure that the ingredients are well blended. Nobody likes chunky bits at the end! I have been seeing a few patients recently who are concerned about their skin. They are either suffering with break out's, dry skin, sensitive skin, inflamed skin,or they have generally unhealthy looking skin that bothers them cosmetically. I am a huge fan of 'Tailor Made Solutions' as we all know, no two people are alike. Every individual is unique. Our bodies also work in systems, meaning one system is not in isolation, especially concerning our skin. Our skin is greatly influenced by what we eat and drink, how well we eliminate our toxins, hormonal function, what we breath, stress levels, and certain diseases. That's a lot to keep under control! Here are some basic tips to help bring out the best looking skin for you: Water Water is best source to eliminate toxins, as well as prevent dehydration. This sounds obvious, but many of us don't consider this when looking at skin changes. 70% of our body content is water based. Also remember that caffeine (tea and coffee) and alcohol dehydrate the skin. for every cup of caffeine or alcohol you drink, you dehydrate your body by two cups. Do the scary maths! Try avoid flavored water as they contain unnecessary flavourants/ artificial sweeteners/ sugar. I water is too 'boring', add a few slices of lemon, cucumber or strawberries. I also love adding torn up fresh Rose Geranium leaves or fresh mint leaves. 2. Raw Fruit and vegetables Our bodies crave fresh, raw fruit and vegetables as they provide essential nutrients to the body. Besides vital vitamins and minerals, they provide essential phytonutrients, especially antioxidants. Fruit and veggies that are red, blue, yellow, orange and green provide lots of nutrients. The richer and deeper the colours, the more the antioxidant content! Strive for organic produce, but if you're getting it from a normal grocer, always rinse thoroughly with salt water and bicarb solution I recommend we should be getting in at least 7- 10 serving a day, in order to bolster skin healing and rejuvenatation. I like to start or end my day with a smoothie. Its an easy way to get at least 5 serving in! Here is an example of what I had this morning: 1 small yellow plum, 1 large celery stick, 1 large crunch pear, 1/2 cup of cucumber, 2 tablespoons of pomegranite seeds, 1 cm slice of fresh ginger root, 3 tablespoons of raw, organic plain yoghurt, water for consistency. Try having at least 4 smoothies a week, and you will see the difference in skin texture and quality! 3. Protein and healthy fats Our skin cells are made up of protein and fats. We must supplement our diets with these in order to maintain the integrity of the skin barrier. An easy way to supplement with them is by eating foods that contain both! Healthy fat and protein sources: Raw nuts and seeds Raw Coconut Avocado Raw dairy (milk, yoghurt, amasi, butter) Eggs (free range/ organic) Meat- fish (low heavy metal tested), chicken (free range/ organic), red meat (grass fed) 4. Supplementation This is only recommended if the you are not getting enough in your diet. Speak to a health professional about more personalised guidance. Skin essentials: Antioxidant vitamins: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E Minerals: Zinc and Sulphur 5. Organic Skin care Natural skin care can have some blurry lines. The main ingredients to avoid in natural skincare are: Alcohol (this is extremely dehydrating) Petroleum jelly Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) Parabens I'm a HUGE fan of organic and natural skincare. I personally use a beautiful range called Esse Organic Skincare. It is South African developed and is COMPLETELY chemical/alcohol free. Its so natural, you could eat it! It's an international exported range. The difference in my skin texture has been amazing, and many of my patients that use this range agree. I love having it as part of my natural brand. Remember, your health is in your hands. Start healing your skin from the inside and you will soon see the rewards! I decided to share this very easy recipe with everyone who watched the show this week on Real Health. All the ingredient can be found in your local spice shop or your pantry! It's a great for warming up the chest and throat, and helps your body fight off any signs of a cold. There are variations that add brandy, however, this is safe for everyone, including children and pregnant woman. The beneficial qualities: Turmeric acts as a wonderful anti inflammatory Cinnamon is an antimicrobial Black pepper promotes sweating and helps rid the body of toxins Ginger eases pain and acts as an anti- inflammatory Cayenne pepper is a mucous decongestant and a natural pain reliever Raw honey contains Propolis which has antibacterial and antiviral qualities Lemon has lots of vitamin C and has immune boosting properties Ingredients: 2 cups of water 1/2 teaspoon ground (or fresh) turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon bruised black pepper 1/2 teaspoon fresh grated ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon raw honey slice of lemon Method: In a small pot, add the water and gently heat on a medium heat Add the turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger and cayenne pepper This month has brought in some very sick patients. This has to be the worst cold and flu season I have seen in a few years. Strange symptoms with fast moving disease pictures. It's especially scary for mother's with young children as the symptoms progress rapidly. My best advice would be to see a qualified homeopathic doctor as soon as possible, and ask for a few days off for sick leave in order to recover. If the infection gets really bad, a good homeopath will refer you to a GP for antibiotics. Here is my guide to surviving this snotty season: AVOID dairy. Bacteria love dairy as it provides nutrition for them to thrive! Dairy also amplifies the production of mucous in the body. Please try your best to avoid milk, yoghurt, cream, etc. AVOID sugar. This is the obvious sugar (as in the granular type you sprinkle over everything), as well as added sugars in foods we eat- tomato sauce, prepacked foods, cereal's. This also includes wheat products- white or brown. These are simple sugars that break down into simple glucose sugars. Unfortunately this may be difficult to avoid... but try your best. Sugar puts a huge strain on our immune system (read this article I previously wrote on sugar: https://yeshthehomeopath.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/how-junk-food-and-sugar-affects-weight-gain/) and actually dampens our recovery process. AVOIDsugary medicines. I am also not a fan of cough mixtures and lozenges as they contain high amounts of glucose. Please read the labels to see if there is sugar in the content. Opt for natural cough mixtures and natural lozenges that are sugar free. Be aware of the addition of artificial sweeteners as well to these 'healthier' options. This must be avoided as their nutritional content is zero, and they only add to the toxicity in our bodies.You will easily find sugar and artificial sugar free products in a health shop. AVOID alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine both dehydrate the body, slowing down other bodily reactions and weakening the immune system. Water is essential for almost every chemical reaction in the body, so when your body is under strain with a disease, every little bit of water counts. Your body also uses a lot of water to temper your fever... so give it what it needs. INCREASE your sleep. I find 'enough sleep' is a relative term in today's modern lifestyle... However, when you are sick, there is no way for your body to recover if you don't get downtime. During your sleep cycle, the body gets an opportunity to detoxify as well as regenerate. This is when the parasympathetic nervous takes over and nurtures your sick body. Also, I'm sure you already feel sleepy and listless, so learn to listen to your body and please do get at least 10-15 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period in order in order to recover quicker. You will probably relish it too. WASH your hands regularly. I know this may sound basic, but many people easily forget this, more so when you are sick! So, after you blow your nose, wash up. If you sneeze of cough, AVOID doing so in your hands. It is an art to practice this, but allow your cough/sneeze to fall into your inner forearm/ inner elbow as you block. This will avoid germs on your hands, and prevent you from spreading it around your home and office. Be conscious of the way we potentially spread germs in an environment, and by no means am I promoting O.C.D like behaviour! AVOID gym and strenuous exercise. This relates to the sleep point. Allow your body some down time and let it recover without being put under more stress. Gym's also are a huge breeding zone for bacteria and viruses, so best to avoid this place until your body is stronger. INCREASE your fluid intake. So the doctor recommends you increase your fluid intake when you have a cold/flu. What does this mean? Water? Juice? Tea? Energy drinks? Again, try to avoid energy drinks and fruit juices. These both contain lots of sugar, and some of the energy drinks contain caffeine. These serve no purpose in your recovery. The answer would be (if you haven't caught on from my article yet!) lots and lots of water! Let it be room temperature water as this is more soothing for the throat. It can get quite boring after a while, so here are a few idea's: 1 cup of warm water, 1 teaspoon of raw honey, 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root, half a slice of fresh lemon 1 cup of warm water, steep in a green tea bag, 1 teaspoon of raw honey A hot toddy- See recipe on my blog! And last, but not least, replenish your spiritual reservoir as you feel your body starting to recover. I recommend visiting your reiki healer for a healing and recharging session. If reiki isn't your thing, go for a soothing aromatherapy massage to help push out the last bit of toxins into your lymphatic fluid, so you can aid the detox process. "}
