Situated at the gateway to Mexico, the university's 6,250-acre campus is among the largest in the world. Founded in 1888 as Las Cruces College, the university was established the next year as a land-grant college by an act of the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of New Mexico in accordance with provisions of the Morrill Act. As New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, the institution grew steadily over the next 71 years, fulfilling its purpose as a nonsectarian center of learning in the broadest possible service to the state and nation. The growth and maturity of the institution was formally recognized in 1960 when the constitution of New Mexico was amended to change the name to New Mexico State University. Today, the university's students can major in 77 areas of undergraduate study in six undergraduate colleges. The Graduate School offers 56 areas of study on the master's level, 3 areas on the specialist in education level, and 26 on the doctoral level. The university offers degrees through the doctorate, is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). In addition, many departments and colleges are further accredited by organizations serving their special fields. New Mexico State University is the state's land-grant university, serv- ing the educational needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensive programs in education, agriculture, engineering, and public service. In its growth and expansion, the university has achieved distinction in many special fields. It has on its campus one of the three full-time planetary observatories in the nation, as well as one of the largest computer centers in the Southwest. NMSU has over $163 million in total sponsored program expenditures. According to the National Science Foundation, NMSU ranks third among all Hispanic Serving Institutions and first among those without a medical school on the basis of FY 2008 research expenditures. The university's central campus is located at the southernmost interchange of the Pan American Highway, Interstate 25, in southern New Mexico. Also bordering the campus is Interstate 10, the principal east-west route across the southern United States. The university is adjacent to Las Cruces, New Mexico.

With the rapidly expanding facilities, laboratories, and library holdings, the Graduate School of New Mexico State University offers unique programs of high quality graduate study. There are 732 regular faculty. The Graduate School mission is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the creation of knowledge, while fostering academic excellence. The Graduate School promotes a high quality-learning environment that embraces diversity. New Mexico State University is one of the few research extensive universities that reflect Hispanic, Native American, other American cultures and the world. Our international students from Latin American, Asian, African, and European countries add to the richness of our diversity. The quality of life for our students is of critical importance to the Graduate School and NMSU. We cultivate the marriage of academic, professional, and personal skills while helping students graduate in a timely manner. The Graduate School and Graduate Student Services strive to provide qual- ity services to students, faculty and staff. GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS, SPECIALIZATIONS/CONCENTRATIONS, AND APPROVED MINORS Because graduate degrees are awarded for attainment in scholarship, the requirements stated in this catalog are to be considered as minimal. The major department or the dean of the Graduate School may make additional require-ments deemed necessary for each candidate. Each student's program is subject to the approval of the respective department head. Responsibility for securing approval of the proposed program of study rests with the student. Frequent consultation with the advisor is essential to satisfactory planning and progress toward a degree. Graduate degrees, concentrations, approved minors, and the programs in which they are awarded are listed below. Please note that these are official spe- cializations/concentrations for each degree program.

facing society require an interdisciplinary approach in graduate education. To prepare the next generation of scholars, scientists and profes-sionals, New Mexico State University offers a number of interdisciplinary degree programs. Through collaborations among departments, our faculty members have created degree programs and concentrations that will equip graduate students with research tools and professional skills to resolve complex societal problems. Interdisciplinary programs include the integration of courses from two or more fields of study in an approved degree program, concentration or minor area of study. We offer three types of interdisciplinary degree programs as listed below. We also offer several approved concentrations and minors within tradi-tional degree programs.

The program of preparation should be substantially equivalent in the distribution of academic subject matter to the requirements for a comparable degree at New Mexico State University. Candidates for advanced degrees are required to demonstrate proficiency in written and spoken English. The minimum grade-point averages required to be considered for admis- sion to a master's program are explained under \"Categories of Graduate Students.\" To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, an applicant must have a grade-point average of 3.0. Some programs also require a master's degree or its equivalent. For admission purposes only, graduate courses older than seven years will not be considered. No student will be officially admitted into a graduate program at NMSU until a \"Certificate for Admission\" has been issued by Graduate Student Ser-vices. Although Graduate Student Services considers this certificate valid for a period of one year, departments may require re-application if the student does not enroll in the semester noted in the certificate. DOMESTIC STUDENT APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION Formal application is required of all prospective domestic students, includ- ing graduates of New Mexico State University, who seek admission to a gradu- ate program. The application is available at the Graduate Student Services home page at http: prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate. Applicants should submit the application form, the nonrefundable $40 appli- cation fee, and official transcripts in sealed envelopes to Graduate Student Ser-vices. Transcripts must be mailed directly from the previous institution to NMSU. Applicants should also contact the department to which they are applying to request any additional application materials required by the department. INTERNATIONAL STUDENT APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION International students must apply through International Student Services by completing the \"International Application for Admissions\" form and paying the nonrefundable application fee of $50. You can request an application or information from International Admissions at the following address: International Admissions, MSC 3G, New Mexico State University, P. O. Box 30001, Las Cruces, NM 88003-8001, U.S.A. The phone number is (575) 646-2017, and the fax number is (575) 646-7721. The e-mail address is ias@nmsu.edu. The web site address is: http://prospective.nmsu.edu/international/ International students that wish to engage in graduate studies at New Mexico State University must be proficient in the English language. To be con- sidered for admission to NMSU, all international students must submit an official score of 550 or above on the paper-based or 79 on the internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The TOEFL is administered by the Educa-tional Testing Service. To learn more about TOEFL, please visit their web site at: http://www.ets.org. New Mexico State University also accepts test scores from the Interna- tional English Language Testing System (IELTS). Please note that IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia, and the University of Cam-bridge ESOL Examinations. A test score of 6.5 or above on IELTS is needed for admissions consideration by Graduate Student Services. The IELTS scores can be used as an alternative to the TOEFL. To learn more about IELTS, please visit their web site: http://www.ielts.org/. Only scores from exams taken within the previous two years and reported directly from the testing service programs to New Mexico State University will be accepted. NMSU's code for TOEFL score reporting is 4531. The TOEFL requirements or the IELTS requirement may be waived for stu- dents who hold a degree from an accredited university in the United States, or from a country or accredited university where English is the official language of instruction. In addition, international students that have successfully completed two years of education in an accredited institution of higher learning in the United States do not have to take the TOEFL or IELTS exams. Exchange students 6 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 that have studied at New Mexico State University for at least one year and main- tained a satisfactory grade point average are also exempt from taking the TOEFL or IELTS exams for admissions into graduate programs at NMSU. The TOEFL requirement or the IELTS requirement may also be waived for international students who demonstrate English proficiency by satisfactorily completing an approved English as a Second Language program within two years of applying for admissions to graduate school at NMSU. NMSU is a univer-sity partner with ELS Language Centers. An ELS course 112 which is completed and passed at an ELS Language Center meets the English proficiency require- ment. Other English as a Second Language Programs must be approved by Graduate Student Services of New Mexico State University. NMSU will accept international students on a conditional basis who have TOEFL or IELTS scores that fall below the accepted levels. International students can be accepted on a conditional basis that have met admissions requirements of Graduate Student Services and the department, and that have an official score of 500 to 549 on the paper-based or 61 to 78 on the internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). A test score between 5.0 and 6.0 on IELTS is needed for conditional admissions consideration by Graduate Student Services. Conditionally admitted international students will need to take the Academic English Proficiency Test offered by the Department of Communication Studies. Based on the recommendation of the Department of Communication Studies, Graduate Student Services may require the student to successfully complete one or more English as a foreign language course(s). If completion of one or more courses is required, the student should enroll in the first such course during his or her first semester at NMSU, or prior to taking an assignment as a teaching assistant. Faculty members can appeal decisions concerning language training needs of students. Students who do not meet the minimum TOEFL requirement for conditional admission (below 61-78 Internet-based, or 500 to 549 paper-based) or IELTS score between 5.0 and 6.0 will be admitted tentatively to NMSU. A tentative admission to NMSU requires that students enroll in intensive English classes through the Center for Intensive Training in English (CITE). Depending on a student's TOEFL score and the CITE Placement Test administered upon arrival, the student will be placed in the Beginning (SPCD 101/401), Intermediate (SPCD 102/402), or Advanced level (SPCD 103/403) of the CITE program. Students will register for 6, 9 or 12 credits for each level based on his or her English language needs. The number of credits is determined by the Director of CITE along with the student's advisor. Students admitted tentatively to CITE should be aware that the duration of their studies at NMSU may be one, two, or three semesters longer in order to satisfy their intensive English requirements. Once completing all necessary levels of the CITE program successfully, students are considered to have achieved the minimum TOEFL-equivalent English proficiency (61 internet- based/500 paper-based) required by NMSU. All students who complete the CITE program will then take the Department Proficiency Test to determine if they will need to take any further non-intensive English courses. For further information about the Center for Intensive Training in English, go to the CITE website at http:// web.nmsu.edu/~nmsucomm/CITE.htm. Conditional students cannot work as teaching assistants. However, they can work as research assistants. Conditional students can become regular stu- dents once they have successfully completed the required English courses and successfully meet regular admissions requirements. Tentative admits with CITE requirement cannot work as teaching or research assistants. DISTANCE EDUCATION APPLICANTS Complete information on Distance Education programs at New Mexico State University is available at (575) 646-4692; (800) 821-1574 in New Mexico; or from the office of Distance Education, MSC 3CEL, New Mexico State University, P. O. Box 30001, Las Cruces, NM 88003-8001; or via e-mail at distance@nmsu. Visit the Web pages at http://extended.nmsu.edu/ and http://distance.nmsu. edu/. Domestic students that wish to enroll in our distance education courses and degree programs must apply for graduate admission through Graduate Stu- dent Services of NMSU. For more information see the section \"Domestic Student Application for Admission\" in this catalog. International students that wish to enroll in our distance education courses and degree programs must be proficient in the English language whether they are part time or full time students. All international distance education applicants must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing system (IELTS). For more information, please see the section on International Admissions. International students apply through the office of Graduate Student Services. For more information see the section \"Inter- national Student Application for Admission\" in this catalog. The College of Extended Learning provides comprehensive distance learn- ing opportunities to meet diverse educational and professional needs anytime, anywhere. As New Mexico's land-grant institution, NMSU has a university-wide mission to expand the capacity of extension, outreach, and distance education to communities across the state. The Distance Education program is designed to serve students who find it difficult or impossible to take classes during the week or on the main campus. The Distance Education program offers regular full- credit courses that may include face-to-face interaction and/or course delivery through synchronous or asynchronous written, electronic, or other media forms. The distance education program also provides quality educational programs at off-campus sites through a variety of different delivery methods. ADMISSION TO A GRADUATE CERTIFICATE PROGRAM A graduate certificate is a program of study that is designed to develop or enhance a focused area of expertise. The primary purpose of graduate cer-tificate programs is to provide specific skill training to meet employment needs locally, regionally, nationally, and globally. A graduate certificate is a focused collection of courses, consisting of 12-18 credits, which are successfully completed by students in a given discipline or a set of related disciplines. A graduate certificate is not an official graduate degree of New Mexico State University. Students that successfully complete a certificate program at the graduate level will receive a certificate of comple- tion statement on their official transcript and a formal certificate from NMSU Graduate Students Services. A student has three years to complete a graduate certificate program. Graduate certificate programs can be offered to currently enrolled degree seeking students and students that meet the admissions criteria but enroll solely to obtain a certificate in a given area of expertise. International students must also meet the international student admissions requirements. Completing courses as part of a certificate program does not guarantee admissions into a graduate degree program. The department makes the final decision on admis-sions into a degree program. Certificate only seeking graduate students who are not currently enrolled in a master's, educational specialist program or doctoral degree program will be admitted into a separate classification called \"Graduate Certificate Student.\" Concentrations or specializations within a graduate program or major differ from graduate certificate programs in that they are designed to meet the needs of enrolled degree seeking students of New Mexico State University. Enrolled degree seeking students must apply separately for the certificate program prior to completing half of their required degree credits. Students enrolled in certificate programs cannot transfer credits from another institution towards the completion of the certificate program offered by New Mexico State University. However, they can transfer credits taken in a graduate certificate program of NMSU into a graduate degree program of New Mexico State University provided that the courses will lead towards a graduate degree in the focused area of the certificate program. The number of transfer credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on course transfer is 5 years after the completion of the certificate. APPLICATION DATES AND DEADLINES To be considered for internal fellowships and graduate assistantships of NMSU, Graduate Student Services encourages students to apply by March 15th for fall enrollment and by October 15th for spring enrollment. Otherwise, please apply at least 30 days prior to the first day of classes. Many of our departments/programs have application deadlines and some may admit students only once a year. Please call or check the departmental web sites to obtain information on application deadlines. Applications received by Graduate Student Services closer to the dead- lines will be processed as time allows. Applicants may be unable to meet their plans to be approved for graduate student status and register for classes if their applications are not received in a timely manner. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible so they can be con- sidered for financial support. For information on awards, see http://gradschool. nmsu.edu/gradschool/announcements.html; for information on grants, fellow-ships, and assistantships see http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/fellowships/index.htm. 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 7 TRANSCRIPTS Applicants must arrange with each institution previously attended to have one official transcript of all their undergraduate and graduate work sent directly to the Graduate Student Services. If undergraduate work has not been completed at time of application, the student must obtain a transcript complete with degree statement as soon as the degree has been granted. No application materials will be returned to the applicant. STANDARDIZED TESTS Some departments may require standardized test scores for admission. Graduate students may be required to take one or more of the following exami-nations, as determined by the major department: Graduate Record Examination, the Miller Analogies Test, the Graduate Management Admission Test. Some departments also require the Graduate Record Examination Subject Test. (See departmental description for which tests are required.) The Graduate Record Examination is required, prior to evaluation of cre- dentials for admission, of all students from universities with a nontraditional grading system. Information booklets and applications for all tests may be obtained from the Office of Student Development or from these Web sites: http:// www.ets.org or http://www.gre.org. READMISSION Former students of NMSU who have been out of school for more than two consecutive terms are required to make formal application for readmission. Applications should be submitted to Graduate Student Services at least 30 days before the opening of the semester or summer session for which the student plans to enroll. A student who has attended other institutions during an absence must have official transcripts forwarded directly to Graduate Student Services by the registrar of each institution and must be eligible to return to the college or univer-sity last attended. Transcripts must be received prior to the date of registration. Admission status at the time of readmission will normally be determined by previous NMSU academic standing. However, academic performance at other institutions attended during the applicant's absence from NMSU may be taken into consideration in determining the student's admission status. RENEWAL OF APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION The admission credentials of applicants who do not register for the semes- ter to which they had been admitted are normally retained in Graduate Student Services for a period of one calendar year from the date of application. At the end of this period, credentials are discarded. Students wishing to renew their applications after the one-year lapse must submit new applications, pay another application fee, and provide new credentials. DENIED ADMISSION Graduate Student Services, or the department in which the applicant wishes to pursue an advanced degree, may deny admission if the scholastic record or program of study is judged inadequate as a foundation for advanced academic or professional study. If denied admission by Graduate Student Ser-vices, the applicant may seek \"undeclared\" status as described in \"Categories of Graduate Students.\" If denied by the department, the student may wish to contact the department for additional information. Admission may be denied to otherwise qualified students when the desired program lacks resources to accommodate additional enrollment. Applicants may be denied admission to either Graduate Student Services or the department/program. A student who is denied admission to one program and wishes to be considered for another program must complete a new applica-tion for the second program and pay another application fee. The second application will be forwarded to the second department, along with supporting documents including transcripts and letters submitted with the first application, once the second application fee is paid. Application documents are retained by Graduate Student Services for only one calendar year. CATEGORIES OF GRADUATE STUDENTS Students seeking admission to a graduate program are assigned to one of the following categories based upon their previous academic performance.Regular Student A student applying for an advanced degree, whose scholastic record is satisfactory, will be admitted as a regular student. This category includes: (a) a beginning domestic graduate student who has either an overall 3.0 grade-point average or a grade-point average of 3.0 in the last half of undergraduate work, (b) a beginning international graduate student who has an overall 3.0 grade- point average (or its equivalent), or continues to earn a 3.0 grade point average, and (c) a continuing graduate student who maintains at least a 3.0 grade-point average in graduate courses. Provisional Student A student applying for an advanced degree whose scholastic record is not entirely satisfactory is admitted as a provisional student. This classification includes: (a) a continuing graduate student whose cumulative grade-point average at the close of any term is less than 3.0, (b) a beginning graduate student who does not have an overall 3.0 grade- point average or 3.0 in the last half of undergraduate work, but who does have at least a grade-point average of 2.5, and (c) a beginning graduate student who has qualified for admission by taking nine graded graduate credits as a undeclared student (defined below). A student admitted provisionally must complete the first three courses totaling at least nine credits of graduate work, with an average of at least 3.0. A provisional student who does not meet the 3.0 grade-point average after at least eight credits of graduate work is subject to dismissal. Provisional students can- not work as teaching assistants. However, they can work as research assistants for one semester. With permission of the Graduate School, provisional students can be employed for one semester as a grader. Departments wishing to hire provisional students as graders must submit an official letter request to the Graduate School. The Graduate School can approve or reject the request. Provisional status is only allowed for one semester. Undeclared Graduate Student Students who have not decided on a specific graduate department or pro- gram, but who have an undergraduate grade point average of at least 2.5 may be considered for admission to the Graduate School under this status. It is critical to note that no more than nine hours of graduate credit taken at NMSU under unde-clared status may be transferred into a degree program. Furthermore, students admitted as undeclared graduate students are not eligible to receive graduate teaching assistantships or financial aid. Transfer from undeclared status to a degree program requires an Applica- tion for Admission so that the appropriate information can be referred to and evaluated by the designated department. For admissions purposes, if the student has nine or more graded graduate credit hours, the cumulative grade-point average must be at least 3.0 for the request for admission to be considered. If the student has fewer than nine graded graduate credits, the recommendation for admission into a degree program will be for provisional status if the undergradu- ate grade-point average is 2.5 to 2.9. If the undergraduate grade-point average is at least 3.0, the recommendation will be for admission under regular status. Completing courses as an undeclared student does not guarantee admissions into a graduate degree program. The department makes the final decision on admissions into a degree program. International students with an F-1 visa are not eligible for the undeclared status. Students who have been denied admission to the Graduate School by the department may enroll as undeclared students in the college of interest and can complete up to nine credits of graduate work (exclusive of directed readings and independent study) with a grade-point average of 3.0 or above. It should be noted that enrollment in some graduate-level courses is restricted to students accepted into specific programs. Undeclared graduate students are not allowed to transfer more than 9 graduate credits of a grade of B or better into a degree program. Academic advising for undeclared students should be obtained from the department or program of interest to the student. After meeting GPA requirement, and upon receipt of an Application for Admission, the student's records will be resubmitted to the department of choice for a decision on admission. Completing courses as an undeclared student does 8 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 not guarantee admissions into a graduate degree program. The department makes the final decision on admissions into a degree program. Any student whose graduate application is incomplete may apply as a undergraduate non-degree student in order to register for classes. Graduate Study by University Seniors (Senior Petitioner) An undergraduate student who is in the last 15 graded credit hours of a bachelor's degree program and who is completing all requirements for gradu- ation, may take up to six credits of graduate level courses numbered from 450 through 598 for credit toward an advanced degree, with the approval of the appropriate department, college dean and the graduate dean. The student must also (1) have a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher or have a grade-point average of 3.0 or higher in the last 45 credits com- pleted; (2) complete the Senior Petitioner Forms of Graduate Student Services at least 30 days prior to registration; (3) once accepted as a Senior Petitioner, they must file a Senior Petitioner Course Form for each course by the deadline to add courses for the semester in which the course is to be taken and obtain approval from the graduate instructor, and the undergraduate advisor; and (4) register for the course at Graduate Student Services. The combined total of graduate and undergraduate courses for the semes- ter may not exceed 17 credits. Senior petitioners must consult with an admission representative at Graduate Student Services. As a senior petitioner in a graduate program, the course(s) will become part of the graduate record and will not be used in the calculation of the student's undergraduate grade-point average or credit hours. For students enrolled in a joint bachelor's and master's degree program see the subsection \"Transfer of Undergraduate Credits to an NMSU Graduate Program\" in the \"Requirements for Enrolled Students\" section of the Graduate Catalog. Nondegree Admission Nondegree admission is designed to meet the needs of students who do not wish to pursue a degree at this university or who have not yet completed the application process to a specific department. It should be noted that enrollment in some graduate-level courses is restricted to students accepted into specific programs. Academic advising for nondegree students should be obtained from the department or program of interest to the student. After meeting this require- ment, upon receipt of a readmission application the student's records will be resubmitted to the department of choice for a decision as to admission. Not more than three courses totaling 9 credits or fewer earned in nondegree status at NMSU may be transferred to a graduate program. NMSU does not recognize graduate credit for nondegree work from institutions other than the University of New Mexico (UNM), from which 6 credits may be accepted with the approval of the appropriate department, the college dean, and the graduate dean. Therefore, any student who has previously been accepted and enrolled in the Graduate School at NMSU should not change to a nondegree program unless it is the intention never to pursue further studies leading to an advanced degree. Students on nondegree status are not eligible to receive financial aid, student employment, or institutional tuition waivers; nor are they eligible to par-ticipate in student government or intercollegiate athletics; nor are they eligible to receive benefits from any veterans' program. Visiting Student A visiting student is one who is taking graduate credits for transfer to his or her parent institution. An \"Application for Admission\" to Graduate Student Services and the application fee must be submitted 30 days prior to registration. The student must also have a letter sent from the parent institution's graduate dean indicating that he or she is admitted to that institution, is in good standing, and that the courses taken at New Mexico State University are acceptable to the parent institution. A visiting student will not be required to submit transcripts; however, the department must concur and admit a visiting student. Please note that the department may require other materials to be submitted before admitting a visiting student. Visiting students will not be eligible for undeclared status or for graduate assistantships. Out-of-State Students and Legal Jurisdiction By applying for admission/enrollment, both the student and parents agree that New Mexico law prevails and all litigation will be in federal court in New Mexico or in state court in Dona Ana County, New Mexico.Graduate Certificate Student A graduate certificate student is enrolled in a certificate program only. The student is not enrolled in any graduate degree seeking program of NMSU. The students' status can change if they apply and are accepted into a graduate degree program. Students currently enrolled in a graduate degree program can also be enrolled in a certificate program. However, their student status will be determined by the degree program. Graduate certificate students are not eligible for graduate assistantships. Completing courses as part of a certificate program does not guarantee admissions into a graduate degree program. The department makes the final decision on admissions into a degree program. TUITION, FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES All costs are given for one term.

PAYMENT OF CHARGES By enrolling in classes at NMSU, a student makes a financial commitment to pay the tuition and fee charges associated with that enrollment. The enroll-ment action constitutes a financial obligation between the student and NMSU and all proceeds of this agreement will be used for education purposes and con- stitutes an education loan pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) (8). Terms and Conditions of Course Registration are posted on the NMSU website and available in each term's registration guide. Payments can be made by mail, web, telephone, or in person at the University Accounts Receivable. Cash, checks, money orders and limited types of credit cards are accepted. Term charges can be paid in full or paid by using a payment plan. Students utilizing the payment plan for the Fall and Spring terms will have the balance due in four equal monthly installments within the term. Summer terms have two installments within the term. A payment plan fee of $20.00 is assessed to students using the plan for each campus enrolled. All financial aid received must be paid towards balances owed. Additional penalty charges may be assessed for failure to make payments when due. The Univer- sity reserves the right to deny a payment plan to any student who has a poor credit rating or who has been negligent in making payments to the University for previous debts.

Fellowships The Graduate School maintains a Fellowship and Grant Information Web page http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/fellowships/ which provides a database of grants, fellowships, and assistantships for graduate students. The university offers a number of fellowships available to both new and continuing students. 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 11 Assistantships Graduate assistantships in teaching and research are available primarily through the department in which the student is enrolled. Eligibility for teaching assistantships includes (a) acceptance by and subsequent registration in the Graduate School and academic department, (b) classification as a \"regular\" graduate student, (c) enroll in and successfully complete nine graded credit hours each semester and (d) maintain a 3.0 grade-point average. Full time status for graduate students is enrollment in nine graded credit hours. Graduate students accepted on a provisional basis cannot serve as teaching assistants. However, they can serve as research assistants. Eligibility includes (a) acceptance by and subsequent registration in the Graduate School and academic department, (b) classification as a \"provisional\" graduate student (c) enroll in and successfully complete nine graded credits hours, and (d) funded on research projects of the faculty of NMSU. Provisional students can also be hired as graders for one semester. The department must submit a formal letter to the Graduate School requesting that the student be allowed to work as a grader. The Graduate School can approve or deny the request. A student seeking appointment as a teaching assistant will be required to demonstrate proficiency in communication skills necessary for satisfactory service in the classroom. All graduate students given an assistantship must attend a mandatory orientation offered by the Graduate School. Departments may also require students to complete workshops/orientations in order to qualify for assistantships. All international students seeking a teaching assistantship must dem- onstrate proficiency in English and competency in pedagogy. Prior to the first semester in which the teaching assistantship is to be received, international students must undergo the NMSU International Teaching Assistant (ITA) screening administered by the Department of Communication Studies on behalf of the Graduate School. Students who pass the screening exam are immediately eligible for assignment to a teaching assistantship. Those who do not pass the screening exam must enroll in and satisfactorily complete COMM 485 before being eligible for a teaching assistantship. To aid those incoming international students who plan to teach in the fall semester, COMM 485 is offered in the sum- mer. International graduate students wishing to hold a teaching assistantship should check with their department to determine when they should arrive on campus to meet the screening requirement. International students who don't pass the screening exam may be eligible to serve as graders for their academic departments. The academic departments must receive approval from the Gradu- ate School in order to hire these students. The duties involved normally require about 20 hours per week (full time fall and spring) of the student's time. By accepting an assistantship, the student is obligated to enroll in and maintain enrollment in a minimum of nine graded cred- its per semester, but not more than 15 per semester. A graduate assistant may not enroll for more than 15 credits for each fall and spring semesters. Courses taken for audit or undergraduate deficiencies are counted in the maximum total course load; audited classes and courses under 450 cannot be used for the mini- mum GA course load requirement. GRADUATE ASSISTANTS SALARIES AND TAX WITHHOLDING GUIDELINES Internal Revenue Service tax withholding guidelines require undergraduate and graduate students employed through New Mexico State University to main- tain at least six credit hours of course work during the fall and spring semesters and three credit hours of course work for summer sessions to be eligible for the student FICA tax exemption. Student employees who do not meet this require- ment during any given pay period will be subject to Social Security taxes at the rate of 6.2% and Medicare taxes at the rate of 1.45%. Salaries for graduate assis- tants in 2011-2012 ............................................................................................................................ $16,000 III ............................................................................................................................ $16,200 Level I applies to students pursuing a master's degree. Level II applies to students (a) pursuing the education specialist or doctoral degree who have passed the qualifying exam or (b) who have a master's degree in the same or cognate field and the recommendation of the head of their major department. Level III applies to a doctoral student who has passed the comprehensive exami- nation. Graduate assistants employed at least ten hours per week will be given in- state tuition during the first 12 months of tenure if the hiring process is approved by Human Resources prior to census date (stated by the Office of the Registrar as the third Friday of the semester each spring and fall semester). If New Mexico resident status has not been established by the time of any reappointment, the graduate assistant may be subject to nonresident tuition rates. Applications for state residency may be obtained in the Office of the Regis- trar, located in the Educational Services Building. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IN STUDENT RECORDS As required by law, social security numbers are collected from prospec- tive and current students who 1) plan to seek employment on campus or 2) wish to receive financial aid. In addition, the university is mandated by federal tax regulations to provide tuition and fee payment information to the student and the Internal Revenue Service, so that applicable educational tax credits may be computed. The social security number will be necessary to submit this tax reporting. The social security number is a confidential record and is maintained as such by the university in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. In order to be employed by New Mexico State University all students must have obtained a social security number within eight weeks of being hired or risk losing their assistantship. When an official social security number is issued to an international stu- dent, it is the student's responsibility to inform Human Resources or the Office of the Registrar as soon as possible. HOURLY WORK Eligibility for student payroll requires that a graduate student (a) be admitted to the Graduate School as well as to a department, (b) have a GPA of 3.0, and (c) be enrolled for at least nine graded credits. A student may not work more than 20 hours per week during the academic year. Students should check with Student Employment Services, Garcia Annex, Room 204, for current job postings. Students not classified as residents of New Mexico but working at an hourly rate are not eligible to receive in-state tuition. FINANCIAL AID The mission of the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarship Services at New Mexico State University (NMSU) is committed to providing a high level of service to support students in achieving their academic goals by helping to remove the financial barriers to college attendance. The office's mission is to offer coordinated delivery of comprehensive student aid programs that are sup-portive of the recruitment and retention of academically talented and diverse students. Although primary responsibility for educational cost rests with the stu-dent and his or her family, NMSU, the federal government, and the state of New Mexico all contribute to assist students pursuing higher education. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarship Services administers a broad spectrum of loans and work-study in an attempt to meet the financial needs of the university's students. The Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarship Services awards financial aid to students according to their indi-vidual needs. Students and spouses, if applicable, are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future income. All information provided to the Office of Student Financial Aid is regarded as confidential. Students applying for financial aid complete a \"Free Application for Federal Student Aid\" (FAFSA) designed to determine, in accordance with state and federal guidelines, the difference between what the student or family is expected to contribute and the cost of attending NMSU. Among the factors that determine the family's expected contribution are (1) annual adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service; (2) savings, stocks, or bonds; (3) other assets in the form of a business, farm, or real estate; (4) nontaxable income and benefits; and (5) student's prior year income and assets. Students applying for financial aid should complete a FAFSA by visiting http://fa.nmsu.edu or http:// www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Please refer to http://fa.nmsu.edu/ for more information on financial aid. A complete listing of programs and policies is available on-line.12 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 GENERAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS To receive financial aid a student must: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Enroll at least half time (as defined by federal regulation); this applies to most Title IV programs. Enroll in an eligible major. Enroll in eligible courses. Maintain satisfactory academic progress defined by federal regulations. Not be in default on any federal educational loans or owe a refund on a grant. Sign a statement of educational purpose, stating that the money will be used toward educational purposes only. SOURCES OF FINANCIAL AID Loans. Available to undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, Federal Perkins Loans are long-term, low-interest loans (5% fixed interest rate) that must be repaid to the university according to federal guidelines. Repay- ment of Federal Perkins Loans begins nine months after graduation or after enrollment drops below half time. Federal Family Education Loans which include subsidized and unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans are need-based, long-term loans available to under- graduate and graduate students. Students receiving a subsidized or unsubsi- dized Federal Stafford loan or a Perkins loan must complete the financial literacy and entrance counseling sessions by clicking on the links at http://fa.nmsu.edu/ financial-aid-how-tos/index.html before NMSU will issue a check. In addition, students must complete an exit interview upon graduation or withdrawal from the university. Repayment of a Stafford loan begins six months after graduation or six months after enrollment drops below half time. The interest rate on new Stafford loans vary according to the year the loan is disbursed. More information will be available at the time the loan is made. Work-Study Programs. The Federal Work-Study Program provides employ- ment opportunities for selected students with demonstrated financial need. The New Mexico Work-Study Program also provides employment opportunities for students; however, only New Mexico residents are eligible to participate in the program. FINANCIAL AID AWARDS All financial aid awards are based on information provided by the student and spouse, if applicable, availability of funds, and eligibility requirements. Any award may be revised based on changes in enrollment, cost of attendance, outside resources, family contribution, or failure to meet satisfactory academic progress. Withdrawals or reductions in enrollment may affect an award or any future awards. Financial aid will not pay for audited courses or for classes in which credit will not be received. FINANCIAL AID SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS Federal regulations require that financial aid recipients meet certain aca- demic standards to be eligible for federal financial aid. To ensure that financial aid recipients are making satisfactory academic progress, academic transcripts are reviewed at the end of each term to determine eligibility for the next term. All terms of attendance are reviewed, including periods in which the student did not receive financial aid. All transfer work is taken into account when satisfactory progress is reviewed. In addition, repeated courses are included in the academic progress calculation. Grade Point Average. Graduate students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 (a B average). Grade point values are: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0. Grades of I, CR, PR, NC, W, U and AU are not calculated in the GPA. Completion Rate. Students must complete a minimum of 2/3 of all course work (registered credit hours) attempted at NMSU. Any course with a grade of Withdraw (W), Incomplete (I), Failure (F), Audit (AU), or No Credit (NC) is consid- ered attempted but not completed. Repeats are considered attempted credits. Maximum Time Frame. Graduate students must complete their program within 200 percent of the credit hours required by the program. Students who have reached the maximum allowable time will be suspended from receiving financial aid. Total attempted hours including repeated courses and transfer course work are included in the student's maximum time frame calculation.FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION Students are suspended from receiving financial aid if they do not meet satisfactory academic progress standards. Students on financial aid suspension will not receive any form of federal or state financial aid (grants, loans, work study). When all standards of satisfactory progress are met, you may contact your Financial Aid Office to have your financial eligibility reinstated. THE APPEALS PROCESS Students suspended from financial aid may appeal the suspension if there are mitigating circumstances affecting their progress. Students who would like to appeal the suspension must submit an appeal form and all required documen- tation to the Office of Student Financial Aid. A committee will review the appeal and may grant reinstatement of financial aid based on mitigating circumstances that directly contributed to deficient academic performance. Appeals are usually evaluated on a term-by-term basis. REGISTRATION Graduate students may register in person at Graduate Student Services or on the Web at https://my.nmsu.edu. No person will be officially registered unless formally admitted to the Graduate School. CHANGE OF ADDRESS In order to assure accurate student records, students are responsible for keeping Graduate Student Services and the Office of the Registrar informed of the following: Changes in residence and mailing addresses; current telephone numbers, and primary e-mail addresses. Failure to do so may result in tran-scripts, diplomas, or other important communications from the university not being received in a timely manner. The deadlines for registration and for the add/drop period are printed in the Schedule of Classes and are available on-line at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/ deadlines/index.htm. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS English Proficiency International students that wish to become teaching assistants must prove that they are proficient in the English language. During summer session II prefer- ably or before the start of the first semester of enrollment, each international stu-dent who is required to submit a TOEFL (Test of English as a Second Language) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score that wishes to be considered for a teaching assistantship must also take the Academic Eng- lish Proficiency Test administered by the Department of Communication Studies. Also, students who successfully complete and pass approved English as a Sec-ond Language (ELS) course, and who wish to become a teaching assistant must also take the Academic English Proficiency Test administered by the Department of Communication Studies. Based on the recommendation of the Department of Communication Studies, the Graduate School may require the student to suc- cessfully complete one or more English as a foreign language course(s) prior to beginning an assignment as a teaching assistant. If completion of one or more courses is required, the student should enroll in the first such course during his or her first semester at NMSU or prior to taking an assignment as a teaching assistant. Enrollment All international graduate students on F-1 or J-1 visas are required to com- ply with Department of Homeland Security regulations governing maintenance of status related to full-time enrollment and making normal progress toward completing a degree. Therefore, all international graduate students are required to enroll in nine or more credits (exclusive of audited work) during fall and spring semesters. SHORT COURSES AND INSTITUTES Short courses and institutes are conducted on the campus each summer and during the academic year. Courses numbered 450 and above have been approved to carry graduate credit for students regularly enrolled in the Graduate School. Registration is required to receive graduate credit for these courses. Concurrent enrollment of graduate students in regular and short courses is 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 13 allowed provided that the combined credits do not exceed 15 in a fall or spring semester. All short courses carrying one semester credit will be graded on an S/U basis, and these S/U credits will be counted toward the student's limit of S/U credits. SUMMER SCHOOL SESSION During the summer session, the maximum number of graduate credits a graduate student may take is 9. Students who wish to enroll in more than 9 cred- its in the summer, must write an appeal letter addressed to the Graduate Dean.

Credit For Military Service New Mexico State University will award academic credit to United States military personnel for courses and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), based on the American Council of Education Guide (ACE) as well as through national standardized tests, such as CLEP, AP, PEP, and DANTES. Credit for mili- tary-training is in accordance with NMSU Faculty Senate Legislation Proposition 24-07/08, which was passed in May 2008. Military Training and Military Occupa-tional Specialties (MOS) must have a recommendation evaluation by ACE (in the ACE Guide) for credit to be awarded. Courses accepted for transfer credit are given an NMSU equivalent and become part of the student's official NMSU tran- script and academic record. If a student wishes to appeal a decision regarding the acceptance of military training/education and/or MOS for academic credit, the student must submit a written statement of appeal to the Dean of the College to which the student has applied. The Dean will review the merits of the appeal and render a decision. The decision of the Dean is final. Only Primary MOS(s) are eligible for academic credit in the initial review and evaluation. Credit for Duty and /or Secondary MOS may be eligible for aca-demic credit if the student petitions the college's Associate Dean. Primary MOS is the primary specialty of a soldier and reflects the broadest and most in-depth scope of military experience. Veterans, active-duty personnel, National Guard and Reservists who are current students or students applying for admission to New Mexico State University may be granted academic credit on a case-by- case basis upon evaluation of military transcripts - Sailor/Marine ACE Registry Transcript System (SMARTS), Army/ACE Registry Transcript System (AARTS), Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) and United States Coast Guard tran-scripts. Course equivalencies and credit hours awarded for a particular NMSU degree are determined by colleges and/or academic departments. Credit hours may be awarded for specific courses toward degree requirement, or as elective credit. The number of credit hours awarded will be determined by the college and/or academic department. NOTE: Students submitting military transcripts for credit evaluation must keep in mind the Maximum Time Frame policy. See FINANCIAL AID section; paragraph FINANCIAL Veterans' Attendance And Satisfactory Progress The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs requires all veterans receiving VA education benefits to make satisfactory progress and systematic advancement toward an educational objective or be liable for over-payments. Satisfactory progress and regular class attendance are expected of such students. If a veteran receiving benefits is suspended for academic reasons, benefits are terminated and will be restored only after readmission to NMSU. If the university has liability claims filed against it as a result of a veteran failing to meet compliance requirements of the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs, the university will not release any academic records on the veteran until such time as the veteran has reimbursed the federal government for funds drawn in violation of those requirements. A student receiving VA education benefits who is pursuing a degree pro- gram offered by New Mexico State University should adhere to the curriculum of that program. Failure to do so will result in the student being certified for less than full-time status or becoming liable for an overpayment. Military Withdrawal The following steps must be taken by all New Mexico State University stu- dents called up for active duty who wish to withdraw from all their classes: a) Military and Veterans Programs. VA students ordered to Active Duty must provide a copy of orders to the MVP office, Garcia Annex, room 141. To assist in reporting accurate information to the VA Regional Office, student should also provide, in writing, last day of class attendance. b) NMSU Registrar. All students presenting their orders to the NMSU Reg- istrar's Office, (575) 646-3411, will receive a military withdrawal from classes and a full tuition and fees refund for that semester. c) Bookstore. Students who still have their receipts for textbooks pur- chased the semester in which they are called to active duty will be given a full refund for these textbook purchases when they present their orders. (575) 646- 4431. Military/Veteran Graduate Student Status Veteran benefits are determined by the number of graded graduate credits of enrollment for a given semester or summer session. Listed below are the credit hours that determine student status for military veterans. Fall and Spring semester: full-time enrollment includes 9 or more graded credit hours, students are considered three fourth time if they are enrolled in 7 to 8 credit hours. Half time enrollment is 5 hours. Veterans enrolled in less than 5 credits hours are reimbursed for tuition and allowable fees only. There are several sessions within the summer term. For the 10 week sum- mer session, full-time enrollment is 6 credit hours and half time enrollment is 3 credit hours. During the five week sessions, full-time enrollment is 4 graded credit hours. REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR STUDENTS GRADING SYSTEM Graduate students are expected to apply themselves intensively to the study of the material covered by the courses in which they are enrolled. Accord- ingly, a high level of performance is required. The student must maintain a grade-point average of at least 3.0 in all graduate courses taken as a graduate student at NMSU. Courses transferred from the undeclared program at NMSU or from other institutions will be included in determining grade-point averages. Grades The grades awarded in all courses are indicative of the quality of work done. Their significance is as follows: Letter Grade Point per Credit A \u2014 For excellent work ............................................................................................... 4 B \u2014 For better than average work ........................................................................... 3 C \u2014 For average work ................................................................................................. 2 D \u2014 For below average work .................................................................................... 1 F \u2014 For failing work ...................................................................................................... 0 W \u2014 Withdrawal ........................................................................................................... 0 N \u2014 Grade not submitted ........................................................................................... 0 CR \u2014 Credit authorized, but not letter grade ......................................................... 0 IP \u2014 In progress ............................................................................................................ 0 PR \u2014 Progress on graduate thesis .......................................................................... 0 S \u2014 Satisfactory work ................................................................................................. 0 U \u2014 Unsatisfactory work ............................................................................................ 0 I \u2014 Incomplete ............................................................................................................... 0 AU \u2014 Audit ..................................................................................................................... 0 Distinctions within a letter grade may be indicated by the use of plus or minus, and these will become part of the official record. S Grade An S grade indicates satisfactory performance. 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 15 C, D, and F Grades Although C grades earned at New Mexico State University may be counted toward the requirements for an advanced degree, this is not considered accept- able graduate-level performance. Courses in which a student earns only a D or F may never be counted toward a graduate degree, although such grades are calculated in determining the grade-point average. Therefore, any grades of D or F must be compensated for by the necessary hours of A if the student is to have the 3.0 grade-point aver- age required before awarding of the degree. Incomplete Grade The grade of Incomplete is given for passable work that could not be com- pleted due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regula- tions apply to removing or changing an Incomplete grade: 1. Instructors may assign an Incomplete grade only if the student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, and similar circumstances. Job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for being assigned an Incomplete. In no case is an Incomplete to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, or Unsatisfactory grades for marginal or failing work. 2. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the \"I Grade Informa- tion Form\" and have the form delivered to the course dean. The instruc-tor will state in writing the steps necessary to complete the remaining course work or the instructor may indicate that the student will be required to re-enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the I grade will not be removed). The student will sign this document or the course dean will send a copy of the document to the student's official permanent address. 3. The student is entitled to have the Incomplete grade removed from the transcript only if the student completes the remaining course work as specified on the \"I Grade Information Form,\" in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. The work must be completed within 12 months after the Incomplete is assigned and prior to the student's graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the \"I Grade Information Form.\" If the student fails to complete the course work, the instructor may change the Incomplete grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F, or Unsatisfactory) provided that the instructor stated that this would occur on the \"I Grade Information Form.\" 4. Incomplete grades can be removed from the transcript by the instructor only during the 12-month period following assignment of the Incomplete or prior to the student's graduation, whichever comes first. To remove an Incomplete, the instructor must complete a \"Change of Grade Form\" and file the form with the Office of the Registrar. The instructor may assign whatever grade is appropriate for the entire course. This may include grades of D, F, or Unsatisfactory. An Incomplete not changed by the assigning instructor within 12 months and prior to graduation shall remain an Incomplete grade thereafter. 5. A student may re-enroll and receive credit for any course for which an Incomplete grade was previously received, but retaking the course will not result in removal of the Incomplete grade from the student's transcript. The effect of removing an Incomplete grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation, or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the Incomplete is included in the grade-point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with grades for the semester in which the student is enrolled. Students may appeal an unsatisfactory grade through the procedure described in the \"Disciplinary Issues for Graduate Students\" section of this catalog. Independent Studies Independent study courses (including directed reading and special topics courses which do not carry a subtitle) are for students capable of self-direction who meet the requirements for the S/U option, i.e., if the students are not eligible for the S/U option, they are not eligible for independent study. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earned in independent study courses. Grading of Research In grading master's and doctoral research and thesis work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the symbol PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) in place of a grade. \"Progress\" indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but gives no indica- tion of its quality. \"Unsatisfactory\" indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality. These symbols remain on the student's transcript permanently. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of credits of research required. After having submitted a series of PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) symbols, the instructor shall report a grade at the conclusion of the final oral examination, or no later than the date the thesis is submitted for the signature of the graduate dean. If the thesis or dissertation and the performance in the final oral examination are found to be acceptable, the instructor shall report S (Sat- isfactory), which grade applies to the preceding series of registrations graded Progress and Unsatisfactory and denotes the overall quality of the entire series. If the thesis or dissertation or the performance in the final oral examination is found to be unacceptable, the instructor shall report U (Unsatisfactory), which grade applies only to the credits of research for the enrollment period in which the examination is administered. Students who accumulate a total of two Unsatisfactory grades in courses numbered 598 (approved courses), 599, 600, 699, or 700 will be placed in pro- visional status. Three Unsatisfactory grades in these courses will result in dismissal from the Graduate School. Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory Course Option Grades of Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory (S/U) may be used for courses taken by a regular status graduate student outside the major department, pro- vided that the student's advisor and the head of the department approve. Depart-ments may designate three credits of departmental courses numbered 500 and above for S/ U option grading with the approval of the college dean and the graduate dean. The S/U grade request form must be submitted to the graduate dean at the time of registration for an academic session. The limitations of the S/U option are as follows: No more than six total credits of S/U courses are permitted on the master's degree. Doctoral candi-dates may take six additional credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy. Registration is limited to one course per semester, and courses with Unsatisfactory grades cannot be used in a student's program. POLICIES ON GRADUATE COURSES Numbering of Courses Courses numbered 100 through 299 are for undergraduate credit only. In no event may courses numbered below 300 be applied toward a graduate degree; 300 through 449 courses are intended primarily for undergraduate level. In some cases, graduate credit may be obtained in courses numbered 300 through 449 with the approval of the student's advisor, the instructor of the course, the program dean, the student's department head, and the dean of the Graduate School. To secure such credit, a written request must be filed with the dean of the Graduate School at the time of registration. However, these courses cannot be deficiencies, and not more than four credits toward a degree can be granted for courses numbered below 400. The total of courses numbered 300 through 449 cannot exceed eight credits. Courses numbered 450 through 499 are designed for seniors and gradu- ates; 500 through 599 are primarily for graduate students working on the master's degree; 600 through 700 are principally for students working on a doctoral degree. Adding and/or Dropping Courses It is the student's responsibility to initiate official withdrawal from a course. Courses may not be added after the last day to add as indicated in the academic calendar (printed on the inside back cover of the Graduate Catalog or on-line at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/. The last day to drop a course is listed in the Sched- ule of Classes and the academic calendar. The refund policy and schedule is also noted in the Schedule of Classes.16 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 Auditing Courses A student officially admitted to the Graduate School may enroll in any class as an auditor with the verbal consent of the instructor, provided the facilities are not required for regular students. Record of enrollment is preserved but no credit is given. Courses being taken as audit will count toward total course load but cannot be used to meet the minimum course load requirements. Because graduate students can enroll in any undergraduate course under the S/U option, they are discouraged from auditing classes. Repeating Courses Any graduate course numbered 450 and above may be repeated. Any computable grade (excluding I, W, AU, CR, S or U) earned for the course will be included in the cumulative grade-point average, but the credit hours may be earned only once. Substitutions and Waivers All substitutions or waivers of required courses for degree candidates must be approved before the last day of registration during the semester in which the student expects to obtain the degree. Challenging Graduate Courses A graduate student may challenge a graduate course by examination. Changes in Registration Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate official withdrawal from a course. Forms are available from the academic advisor or in the deans' offices. Courses may not be added or dropped after the deadline date indicated in the university calendar. For refund policy, see the \"Costs\" section of the catalog. When a student officially drops a course, the W grade is assigned as fol- lows: 1) No grade is assigned during the registration period.2) A W grade is assigned to any student who officially drops a course dur- ing the first half of its duration. A student may not officially withdraw from a course after this time. All drop forms must be signed and dated by the instructor of the course and the advisor. 3) A grade of W is assigned in all courses to any student officially withdraw- ing from the university prior to the last three weeks of classes. Any person attending under Veterans Educational Assistance should notify the Office of Veterans' Programs if dropping or adding courses changes enroll-ment status for benefits. TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDITS INTO A DEGREE PROGRAM A student may transfer graduate credits taken at NMSU as well as gradu- ate credits from another university to New Mexico State University, provided the credits were earned on the campus of an accredited institution. Transferred course work (grades and hours) is maintained separately from NMSU course work. Immediately after initial enrollment in the Graduate School, students must submit forms to obtain formal permission from the department head, the dean of the college, and the dean of the Graduate School to transfer graduate-level course work. The department has the responsibility to accept or reject any num-ber of transferred credits based on such elements as whether the work fits into a logical program for a degree, if grades of A or B have been earned in the courses proposed for transfer, and any other elements it deems relevant. Credit granted for work done at another institution is tentative until proved by satisfactory work in residence, and the department may also require work to be validated by examination. At the master's level, students must take at least 50 percent of the course work required for the degree from faculty of New Mexico State Univer- sity to meet the residency requirements for their degree. Transfer credits must meet the same time-limit requirements (seven years) as graduate classes at accredited universities. Course work taken elsewhere after initiation of Graduate School at NMSU must have prior approval of the department head and the dean of the Graduate School if such work is to be transferred. All requirements as to accreditation, level, grades, and other elements described for initial transfer work will apply. \"Request for Transfer of Credit\" forms are available at Graduate Student Services.TRANSFER OF CREDITS FOR CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Students enrolled in certificate programs cannot transfer credits from another institution towards the completion of the certificate program offered by New Mexico State University. However, they can transfer credits taken in a graduate certificate program of NMSU into a graduate degree program of New Mexico State University provided that the courses will lead towards a graduate degree in the focused area of the certificate program. The number of transfer credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on course transfer is 5 years after the completion of the certificate. TRANSFER OF UNDERGRADUATE CREDITS TO A NMSU GRADUATE PROGRAM A student who is enrolled in a specially designated, pre-approved (by the graduate dean and the applicable academic college dean(s) joint degree program that leads to the student being awarded both undergraduate and gradu- ate degrees may petition to have two graduate level courses (up to six credits) previously taken for undergraduate credit considered as transfer credits into the student's graduate degree program. To be considered for transfer credit, a course must have been taken by the student as a senior, and prior written permission must have been received from the director of the applicable graduate program, the course instructor, and the department head. In addition, only courses in which the student received a grade of B or better will be considered for transfer credit. Credit can be transferred once the student has been accepted into the graduate degree program. Approved joint undergraduate/graduate degree programs are listed in the section called \"Graduate Degree Programs.\" \"Request for Transfer of Credit\" forms are available at Graduate Student Services and on the web page http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/current/ index.html. LEAVING GRADUATE SCHOOL Leave of Absence/Continuous Enrollment Students working on advanced degrees who plan an interruption in studies for a calendar year should address a request for leave of absence through their department head, alerting the dean of the Graduate School. The student must submit a formal letter through their department head to the Dean of the Graduate School. Email will not be accepted. The request should include the beginning date and the anticipated ending date for the period of absence. A graduate student on leave of absence will be expected not to use university facilities and place no demands upon the university faculty and staff, and, therefore will pay no fees. Time spent in leave-of-absence status will not be counted toward time limits. A graduate student who fails to register for one calendar year without obtaining a leave of absence from the Graduate School will be considered withdrawn from the university. For information on resuming studies after such absence, see \"Readmission.\" Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an official procedure that must be approved as indicated on the withdrawal form. All such withdrawals will be registered on the student's transcript. It is the student's responsibility to initiate withdrawal from the university and to obtain necessary signatures. Students who leave without following the official procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. The withdrawal process is initiated at the Registrar's Office. Appli-cable dates are published in the university calendar for all regular sessions. Military Withdrawal See the section on Military/Veterans and Family Members for special provi- sions for servicemembers. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS Graduate Student Appeals Board Each academic year a standing committee, consisting of three members of the graduate faculty and two graduate students, is appointed by the dean of Graduate School to handle grievance complaints including grade appeals. Any graduate who believes that he or she has been unjustly treated within the aca-demic process may proceed as far as necessary in the following steps to resolve his or her grievance. In general, there are three levels at which a grievance can be addressed: a course instructor or advisor, a department head, or the dean of 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 17 the Graduate School. If the initial grievance is with an instructor or advisor, the process begins at Step 1. If the initial grievance is with a departmental commit-tee, the process begins at Step 3. In all instances, the process must begin at the lowest possible level. 1. Under normal circumstances, the student should discuss the issue with the instructor/advisor. 2. If the student is unable to resolve the issue through consultation with the faculty member, the student must submit a written memorandum detail- ing the grievance to the course instructor or advisor within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The person to whom the memorandum is addressed must respond in writing within 10 calendar days to the student. 3. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1-2, he or she must submit a written appeal to the department head within ten working days of the initial decision. If the student is initiating the appeal at the departmental level, he or she must do so, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The department head must respond in writing within ten working days to the student, the instructor or advisor (if one is involved), and the dean of Graduate School. 4. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1-3, they must submit a written grade appeal letter to the academic dean's office of the college where the course is taught. If it is a grievance against a faculty member, then the academic dean's office where the course is taught would be that of the faculty member's college. The student has 10 calendar days after receiving the decision of the department head. The associate dean of the given college has 10 days to collect the necessary documents to make a decision on the student's appeal or grievance. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. The academic dean's office where the course is taught may convene an ad hoc com- mittee to investigate the case. 5. If after the fourth step the student or any of the other parties involved is still not satisfied with the response, he or she must present to the dean of the Graduate School within ten working days a formal letter that provides specific details regarding the nature of the grievance. Copies of all docu- ments including course materials and grades must accompany the letter. In the letter, the student can request that their case be presented to the Graduate Student Appeals Board. After receiving a letter complaint (not an email), the dean or associate dean of the Graduate School will determine whether the complaint has merit. He or she will do so after reviewing the letters from the faculty member, the department head and the office of the academic dean as well as the materials from the student and all those involved in the case. If the graduate dean determines that the appeal does not have merit, he or she will inform the appellant and other parties, in writing, within ten working days of receiving the appeal. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. If the graduate dean decides that the appeal does have merit, he or she will convene the Graduate Student Appeals Board, normally within three weeks. The Graduate Student Appeals Board will conduct, within 60 days of their convening, whatever investigations and deliberations are necessary, and will forward to the dean of the Graduate School a recommendation to resolve the grievance. 6. After reviewing the recommendation of the Graduate Student Appeals Board, the dean of Graduate School will, within ten working days, inform all parties involved of his or her decision in writing. 7. The dean of the Graduate School may waive the normal time frame for grievances when either party presents compelling evidence justifying such a delay, but grievances must be launched within one year. Grade appeals involving charges of plagiarism must follow the process estab- lished on academic misconduct in the Student Code of Conduct. The web site is http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html Graduate School strongly encourages students to study and use the Plagiarism web site of the Library to learn of ways to avoid plagiarism: http://lib. nmsu.edu/plagiarism. Academic Probation and Suspension Academic records of all graduate students are reviewed at the end of each semester. A student whose cumulative grade-point average at the end of any semester is less than 3.0 will be so informed and will be placed on probation. If, during the next enrollment period, a student fails to achieve a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or to show substantial improvement in the quality of work (as determined by the graduate dean in consultation with the student's primary department), the student will be suspended for one semester from the Gradu- ate School. Students on suspension are barred from enrolling in graduate level courses at NMSU. Students on suspension who wish to continue Graduate School after suspension must re-apply to the Graduate School and the depart- ment of interest. Subsequent suspensions will be for one calendar year and the student must petition the graduate dean for re-admission. No NMSU graduate level course credit will be granted for courses taken at NMSU or other institu- tions while under suspension from NMSU. The Graduate School provides workshops on ways to succeed in gradu- ate studies. All students are encouraged to take advantage of these workshops which can be found at, http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/workshops. Disciplinary Probation and Suspension Graduate students are subject to the rules and regulations with respect to disciplinary probation and suspension as listed in the \"Student Code of Conduct\" section of the Student Handbook http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html and in the \"Regulations\" section of the Undergraduate Catalog http://www.nmsu. edu/Academic_Progs/Undergraduate_Catalog/. Graduate students who engage in academic misconduct at any of the other campuses of New Mexico State Uni-versity, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. Attendance and Student Behavior The instructor may report any absences to the graduate dean when the number of absences from class (including audited courses) is impairing the work of a student in a course. The graduate dean may drop a student from a class for persistent absence when such action is recommended by the instructor. Simi- larly, a student may also be dropped from a class for engaging in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class. Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing New Mexico State University on a university-sponsored event (e.g., ASNMSU president representing NMSU at leg- islative session, student-athletes competing in NMSU-scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational field trips and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the students of their class responsi- bilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department. Only students who have enrolled in a class for credit or audit are allowed to attend classes. A student who has officially withdrawn from a course may con- tinue to attend the course with the permission of the instructor for the remainder of the semester. Students not enrolled may visit classes only with the permission of the instructor. Academic Conduct of Graduate Students Graduate students at New Mexico State University are expected to observe and maintain the highest academic, ethical, and professional standards of conduct. Students should consult Section III of the \"Student Code of Conduct\" in the Student Handbook (http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/index.html) for more spe-cific information regarding the rules of conduct and definitions of misconduct. In the event these standards of conduct appear to have been breached by viola- tions such as plagiarism (consult the Library's Web page at http://lib.nmsu.edu/ plagiarism), cheating, nondisclosure or misrepresentation of academic creden-tials, fabrication of data, or other forms of academic misconduct, the procedures set forth below shall be employed to resolve the issues. As mentioned before, graduate students who engage in academic misconduct at any of the other cam-puses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. Procedures to Deal with Cases of Alleged Academic Misconduct in Graduate School Policies and procedures for dealing with such cases are detailed in the in the Student Code of Conduct http://www.nmsu.edu/~vpsa/SCOC/. Questions concerning these policies and procedures should be addressed to the dean of the Graduate School. Procedures include all course levels and all 18 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 of the campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carls- bad, Dona Ana, Grants and Las Cruces PRIVACY ISSUES Privacy rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98-380), \"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974\": Student's name, address, e-mail address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, classification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent, previous educational agency or insti- tution attended by the student. Other information regarding disclosure of student data is posted at the Office of the Registrar in compliance with the act. Requests for withholding directory information must be filed in writing with the Office of the Registrar. PURGING OF STUDENT FILES All files of students who have attended NMSU Graduate School are kept for five years following final enrollment and then destroyed. Only archival docu-mentation is retained. The files of students who do not enroll are destroyed after one year. TRANSCRIPT OF CREDITS An official transcript is the University's certified statement of a student's complete NMSU academic record. It includes coursework, grades, and degrees earned. Credit hours earned through transfer work are not listed in detail, but do appear as cumulative totals. Transcripts are available as digitally-signed PDFs or printed copies. Tran- scripts can be ordered online at http://mytranscript.nmsu.edu. A fee is charged for each copy. No transcript will be released if the student is in debt to the uni-versity. The student name appearing on the transcript will be the same as it appears on the student's official NMSU records. Name changes are processed for current students only. Contact the Office of the Registrar, registra@nmsu.edu, for additional information. CHANGE OF ADDRESS In order to assure accurate student records, students are responsible for keeping Graduate Student Services and the Office of the Registrar informed of the following: Changes in residence and mailing addresses; current telephone numbers, and primary e-mail addresses. Failure to do so may result in tran- scripts, diplomas, or other important communications from the university not being received in a timely manner. EVALUATING YOUR ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE As part of its continuing effort to maintain quality academic programs and to provide strong support services, New Mexico State University routinely con- ducts surveys. Students may be required to participate in one or more of these activities. The resulting data will be published only in aggregate form. REQUIREMENTS FOR ENROLLED STUDENTS The following are general requirements applying to all graduate students. Requirements applicable to specific graduate degrees follow this section. FULL-TIME GRADUATE STUDENT A full-time graduate student is one enrolled for nine or more credits per semester, other than for tuition purposes. Students doing graduate work while engaged in full-time, off-campus employment should limit themselves to one or two courses per semester. Graduate students should take into consideration any outside workload and commitments in planning their course load. Full-time graduate students without other commitments normally enroll for nine to 12 graded credits each regular semester; the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take in any regular semester is 15. During the summer session, the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take is 9. Graduate students may enroll for one additional credit that is not graded (i.e., Audit) for summer, fall, and spring semesters. COURSE DEFICIENCIES Students who have been admitted with departmental deficiencies may be required to take diagnostic tests and additional qualifying examinations. They must complete satisfactorily, in a manner specified by the major department, all undergraduate course deficiencies as prescribed by the department responsible for the graduate program. Course deficiencies will be listed on the transcript; however, these deficiencies will not be calculated in the student's graduate GPA or graduate hours. With the permission of the student's advisor and the head of the depart- ment, courses to meet undergraduate deficiencies may be taken under an S/U option (with S being a grade satisfactory to the professor). These courses will not affect the maximum number of S/U graduate credits permitted. SPECIALIZATIONS/CONCENTRATIONS A specialization is a collection of coursework in a specific area that is part of a degree program of study at NMSU. Only approved specializations/concen- trations within a students' department or program may be noted on a transcript. Students must file a request for inclusion of an approved specializations/ concentration at the time they file their program of study and must identify the specializations/concentration in their application for the degree. Specializations/concentrations will not be added to a transcript after the degree is awarded. Departments must certify that a student has met the requirements for a specializations/concentration at the time the student successfully completes the final examination. DECLARATION OF MINOR Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. All minors must be approved by the minor department head and the dean of the Graduate School and normally consist of nine credits. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and final examinations. COMPLETING A THESIS OR DISSERTATION The student must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the thesis no later than seven working days before the date of the final examination. The form and style of the thesis or dissertation must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the thesis-approval process and binding. See http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the graduate reviewer on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The thesis must be submitted to the graduate reviewer on or before the deadlines posted in the current academic calendar printed inside the back cover of the current Graduate Catalog and at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/ deadlines.htm. The thesis or dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the binding section staff in Branson Library. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT - Evaluating Your Academic Experience New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learning environment. Assessment is a process of rigorous review followed by implementation of changes to enhance and improve the quality of education students receive at NMSU. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of, and engaged in, assessment activities. Faculty and staff at NMSU will communicate to students the value and implications of assessment. For their part, students will provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development. Students are expected to participate in all types of assessment when asked to do so. Types of assessment activities include class assignments, course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments will be published only in aggregate form. Efforts will be made to inform students of assessment results and the program improvements imple-mented as a result of assessment. 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 19 REGISTRATION FOR SUMMER GRADUATION If the final examination is to be scheduled or the thesis is to be completed during the summer, the student must register for one credit hour during the summer session in which the oral examination will be held or the thesis will be completed. In order to graduate during a summer session the student must also have filed the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline posted in the current Schedule of Classes, or the academic calendar printed on the inside back cover of the current Graduate Catalog, and at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/ deadlines.htm. APPLICATION FOR DEGREE (DIPLOMA) The student must file an \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline set forth in the Schedule of Classes. The student must submit the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" to the Office of the Registrar prior to the last day for reg-istration for the final semester or summer session in which the student will be completing degree requirements. Students filing an \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" after the deadline will be charged an additional $25 fee. No \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" forms are processed after midterm.The Graduate School will not approve Applications for Degrees after the late fee deadline has been reached. If a student does not complete requirements for the semester for which the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" has been made, then the student must reapply for the degree and pay all applicable fees for the semester in which the degree requirements will be completed. ATTENDANCE AT COMMENCEMENT To participate in commencement, all eligible candidates must have applied for their degree by the deadline established by the Registrar's Office (http://nmsu.edu/~registra/degdate.html) and met all final degree requirements set by their department, the Graduate School and Graduate Student Services. In addition, doctoral degree students who wish to participate in commencement must have applied for their degree by the deadline established by the Registrar's Office, submitted their dissertation title by the deadline set by the Graduate School and met all final degree requirements. The title of the dissertation will be published in the Commencement book provided that all requirements and deadlines were met by the student. Degree recipients from the previous summer session who wish to participate in commencement must attend the fall ceremony. Students who complete all degree requirements in the spring semester attend the spring ceremony. Participation in commencement does not, in itself, mean that a student is considered an NMSU graduate. In order to receive a graduate degree, a student must fulfill all university requirements. The degree will reflect the graduation date when all requirements were met. THE MASTER'S DEGREE New Mexico State University offers both academic and professional master's degrees. If the student's undergraduate program fails to provide a proper founda- tion for advanced work in the chosen field or department, the student may be required to take classes to correct those deficiencies, consequently resulting in a longer period of residence than would otherwise be required. AMOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF WORK A minimum of 30 semester credits is required for the master's degree. Most master's degrees require at least 15 credits in courses numbered 500 or above, including thesis credit for master's programs involving a thesis. Master's pro-grams involving a thesis include no more than six and no fewer than four credits of thesis. (See the section on \"Thesis\" for further guidelines.) At least 15 credits for the master's degree must be for work in courses in the department in which the student was admitted. Additional credits may be selected from other fields to fit into a logical, justifiable program. Courses used to remove deficiencies or satisfy prerequisites cannot be counted as part of the requirements for the master's degree. Students must take coursework from a variety of faculty. Students may not take more than half of the minimum credits required for a master's degree (excluding thesis credits) with the same professor. Short courses of less than one summer session or one semester duration cannot constitute more than one-fourth of the total course requirements for a master's degree. PROGRAM OF STUDY It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a complete tenta-tive program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This tentative program should be kept in the student's file within the department and is not to be considered as the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" which contains the permanent program. APPLICATION TO CANDIDACY The admission of a student to the Graduate School does not imply admis- sion to candidacy for an advanced degree. The major department in which the student intends to become a candidate for a master's degree must be satisfied as to the student's sound basic training and the ability to pursue studies at the graduate level. Departments may require a comprehensive qualifying examina-tion before officially approving any candidate for the master's degree. An \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" which formally lists cur- riculum requirements for the student's program of studies, must be filed with Graduate Student Services no later than after the completion of 12 credits of graduate work. At the time the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" is submitted, the student must have a cumulative graduate grade-point average of 3.0. The application may specify the Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of matricula- tion, provided that the catalog is not more than seven years old. Otherwise, the current Graduate Catalog will be used. The student's program listed in the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" must (1) meet the requirements of the chosen catalog, including the regulations of the Graduate School and of the major department, (2) include undergraduate deficiencies and required courses specified on the student's \"Certificate of Admission,\" (3) be certified by the stu-dent, the student's advisor, heads of departments offering major and minor fields, and the cognizant deans, and (4) list each course number and abbreviated title with the hours and grades. If the program is not satisfactory in the judgment of the graduate dean, it may be returned to the department for revision. When the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy\" has been approved by the graduate dean, the student will be formally admitted to candidacy for the master's degree. THESIS OR NON-THESIS OPTION A thesis in the major field is recommended and may be required, at the discretion of the department concerned. Not more than six nor fewer than four thesis credits may be counted toward the requirements for a master's degree. Many departments have a non-thesis option. Please check with the depart- ment on the non-thesis option. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT Having once registered for thesis, a student must continue to register for a minimum of one credit in thesis or graduate course work each regular semester until the thesis is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the require- ments in effect at the time of reapplication. GRADUATE COMMITTEE The master's degree committee will consist of a minimum of three faculty members holding at least master's degrees. The committee chair and one other member must be in the student's department; however, the home department of one of these two committee members may be outside the student's depart- ment (see Graduate Faculty Guidelines section \"Appointments Outside of Home Department\"). The third person on the committee must serve as the dean's repre- sentative and cannot be a faculty member of the students' home department. The committee chair and the dean's representative must be members of the graduate faculty (please refer to \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appoint-ments\"). If the student has an approved minor area of study then either the dean's representative or a fourth committee member must come from the minor department.20 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 If no minor is declared, the dean's representative may come from a related area (recommended by the committee chair) or be appointed independently by the dean of the Graduate School. All students completing a written exam are required to have a dean's representative that reviews the process of administering the exam. The dean's representative can sign off on all of the exams of students taking a written exam for the given semester. The dean's representative must be from outside the stu- dents' home department. The faculty committee of the student is responsible for identifying a dean's representative and completing the examination forms. A list of graduate faculty is available at the web site of the Graduate School. Faculty can use the list to identify graduate faculty to serve as the dean's representative. Departments can nominate individuals with a master's degree and/or doc- toral degree and related experience for a temporary appointment to graduate faculty (please see Appointment to Graduate Faculty of Non-NMSU Employees in the Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments in this Graduate Catalog). Nomination letters must identify specific roles of the individual and the year(s) of service (up to three years per request per individual). The nomination letter must receive the endorsement of the academic dean. If granted a temporary appoint-ment to graduate faculty, the individual will be limited to the specific role(s) iden-tified by the department. Departments can request that the individual be allowed to serve as a dean's representative. As indicated in the \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments,\" any qualified member of the graduate faculty may join any graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which they are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the dean of the Graduate School. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members as long as the stated conditions of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. FINAL EXAMINATION Each candidate will be given a final examination conducted by the gradu- ate committee in accordance to the schedule provided by Graduate Student Services. It is the student's responsibility to be sure that the form to schedule this examination is submitted to the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. At the time of the final examination, a graduate student must have an NMSU cumulative graduate grade-point average of at least 3.0 and must be enrolled in the final semester; or, if the student is writing a thesis, he or she must have completed all course work for the master's degree. Students with the nonthesis option may be required to pay a special exam fee in lieu of registering for one credit hour of graduate course work. (See \"Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses.\") The final examination format shall be determined by the department, with the approval of the graduate dean. If a department does not specify an examina- tion format, the final examination shall consist of an oral defense of the student's thesis (if one was written) as well as a general examination of the candidate's field of study. Any candidate who fails in the final examination may (1) upon recommen- dation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester, or (2) be excluded from further candidacy for the degree. Failure in the second examination disqualifies a candidate from obtaining the degree. Certification that the thesis has been accepted and that the final examination has been passed must be filed with Graduate Student Services not later than one week before the degree is con-ferred. TIME LIMIT The graduate program leading to the master's degree must be completed within seven years (or eight successive summers) including completion of the master's thesis or final project. Any course work more than seven years old at time of the final examination will not be included in the program. MINORS A candidate for a master's degree may select up to two approved minors in addition to the major. A minimum of nine credits of graduate work is necessary for a minor at the master's level. (See \"Graduate Degree Programs, Specializa- tions/ Concentrations, and Approved Minors\" for a list of approved minors.) To record a minor on a student's permanent record, the minor must be listed on the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" and this form must be signed by the head of the department offering the minor program. At the oral examination, a committee member may move to remove the designation of a minor with the concurrence of the committee. A minor will not be awarded after the degree has been posted to the tran- script. INTERDISCIPLINARY MASTER'S DEGREE Interdisciplinary studies at New Mexico State University are intended for individuals specializing in programs that require the integration of more than one discipline to fully engage in the field of study. Interdisciplinary studies provide a mechanism to address emerging scholarship, innovation, and research and allows graduate students to engage in emerging technologies, optimizing their education outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinary study takes advantage of traditional academic training within specific departments yet allows students to customize their own career preparation. In these programs, a coherent common core is expected and is intended to combine existing courses across disciplines to meet unique objectives. The Master of Science or Master of Arts degrees are awarded for interdisciplinary programs and are carried out under the direction of the student's graduate com- mittee. The interdisciplinary studies option should not be used in cases where the applicants' objectives can be realized by admission to a specific department and inclusion of up to two minor areas in the program of study. Admission Students follow the regular admission procedures set forth by the Graduate School. In completing the application, the applicant indicates IMAS in the sec- tion requesting Department or Program and designates the area of interdisciplin- ary study in the section requesting \"Field or area of advanced study.\" A proposal for interdisciplinary studies (see 1 below) must be submitted with the application. A departmental referral form will be generated and sent to the primary depart- ment specified in the proposal (see 3 below). Once the student's graduate com- mittee is designated, the committee can require additional materials such as a statement of interest, letters of recommendation, GRE or GMAT scores, and a personal interview. Thesis/Non-thesis option As with any graduate student, the student in interdisciplinary studies can select to follow a thesis or non-thesis option. Students enrolled in the thesis option register for six thesis credits. Students not wishing to follow the thesis option will be required to complete a project report. The project must reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the program in which the student is engaged. Comprehensive exam Students in interdisciplinary studies take a comprehensive exam composed of questions designed by the student's committee. Two individuals in the areas of study plus the dean's representative outside of the department/program/interdis- ciplinary study option will be involved. A chair is also identified. Degree awarded Students receive a Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS) and a concentration in the interdisciplinary study area. Other conditions that apply 1. The student must present a written description of the program concept consisting of (a) objective of the program of study including proposed areas of skill development, proposed courses in more than one gradu- ate degree granting department of NMSU, and (b) a justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. In addition the student needs to designate the degree being sought (Master of Science or Mas- ter of Arts) and a name for the interdisciplinary area. 2. The student's program of study must include a minimum of 30 graduate level credits and a maximum of 36 credits. The student may take six cred- its in departments that do not grant a graduate degree but the courses must be numbered 450 and above, and be pertinent to the program of study. 3. The majority of the departments involved in the student's program will be master's degree and doctoral degree granting departments. The student is expected to take at least 15 credits in the primary area of study within one department. The department selected by the student will receive a 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 21 copy of the student's application for admissions from Graduate Student Services. In addition, the student is required to select an approved minor area of study in another department that consists of at least 9 credit hours (see the Approved Graduate Minors and Programs section for the approved list of minors). 4. The student will form a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty and select an advisor who will chair the committee. The chair must be from the primary department where the student has taken at least 15 credit hours listed in the proposal submitted and the other com-mittee member must be from another department in which the student has selected a minor area of study from the approved list of minors listed in the Graduate Catalog. The third faculty member must be the dean's representative. 5. The student will be required to submit the Candidacy Form to Graduate Student Services after 12 credits are satisfactorily completed. 6. The program will meet all requirements of a master's degree, as listed in the Graduate Catalog; with the interpretation that \"major field\" includes courses from two or more departments and in the designated interdisci-plinary study area. 7. The program of study will include completion of a research thesis or proj- ect. The work may be submitted in the form of a publishable manuscript, technical report, thesis or creative option. 8. The student may enroll on a part-time basis keeping in mind that course- work cannot be more than seven years old at the time of the final exami-nation. 9. The student will be administered a final comprehensive exam that is consistent with the department selected for the primary area of study. For example, if a department requires a written exam, the student in the interdisciplinary masters will also be required to take a written exam. 10. The final oral comprehensive exam will consist of questions pertinent to the area of study and the defense of the research thesis or project. In both cases an integrated approach to the areas of study chosen should be followed. 11. All other rules for graduate study at NMSU must be followed. SECOND MASTER'S DEGREE A student who has earned one master's degree at NMSU may be allowed to count a maximum of six semester credits earned on the first degree toward a second master's degree, if those credits fit into a logical graduate program. The number of shared credits may be increased for dual and joint degree programs. DUAL AND JOINT DEGREE PROGRAMS A dual degree program is a program of study whereby courses of study are combined so that students can complete two degree programs of study in less time than it would take if the programs were independently pursued. Upon graduation, they receive two separate diplomas from each degree program of participating departments and/or institutions. To enroll in a dual, students must complete two separate applications, receive two independent offers of admis- sions, and meet program and course requirements of both programs of study. A joint degree program is one where two or more departments interweave their courses and course requirements to create a single degree program. Students are admitted into one program, take courses in each participating department, college or university, but only received one degree and diploma. These degree programs allow departments and/or campuses to take advantage of faculty talents. Both dual and joint degree programs must have prior approval by the Graduate School. Students must apply and be accepted into graduate programs of each department participating in a specific dual or joint degree program. The list of approved dual and joint degrees can be found in the section \"Graduate Degree Programs.\" TEACHER LICENSURE Students wishing to take graduate courses for licensure or renewal of licensure or for personal enrichment must be fully admitted to a department to do so. Undeclared students may not register for teacher licensure classes. Endorse-ment is available at both the elementary and secondary levels in bilingual educa-tion, TESOL (Teaching of English as a Second Language), reading, and special education. Endorsement is also available in early childhood education at the elementary level. Contact curric-instr@nmsu.edu for more information.SPECIALIST IN EDUCATION DEGREE The degree of specialist in education is provided for experienced members of the education profession who have completed the master's degree (except the school psychology program, which requires the bachelor's degree) and have maintained a 3.3 grade-point average during pursuit of this degree or its equiva- lent. Primary emphasis is placed on the development of competencies needed for a professional specialization in a given field. Programs are available in cur-riculum and instruction and school psychology. Students must complete the general application for the Graduate School. They should also check with the admitting department for specific departmental requirements. Residency and Credit Requirements The specialist in education degree requires a minimum of 30 semester credits beyond the master's degree, including research, intern experiences, and graduate courses. The student meets the campus residency requirement by completing a minimum of 24 credits from faculty of New Mexico State University. The student must maintain a 3.0 average. No more than six semester cred- its of C level work are allowed in this program. Program of Study It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a complete tenta- tive program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This tentative program should be kept in the student's file within the department and is not to be considered as the \"Application for Admission to Candidacy,\" which contains the permanent program. Transfer of Credits A maximum of six graduate credits earned at another approved institution may apply to this degree. Transfer credits must have been earned during the five-year period prior to completion of the specialist in education degree. Major Field All course work taken for the degree should apply directly, through a logical program of study, to the specialty which the candidate has selected. Two to six credits will be earned through research that is acceptable to the College of Edu- cation and the cooperating educational agency. Each department is responsible for defining the required sequence of courses. Candidacy Following the successful completion of 12 semester credits beyond the master's degree, the student is eligible for admission to candidacy. With the achievement of candidacy, a committee is appointed to work with the candidate on the remainder of the program. The committee consists of three members of the graduate faculty in the College of Education. Internship Each candidate will earn from three to six semester credits in an internship. This experience will consist of supervised performance of duties related to the candidate's specialty. The structure of the internship will be determined by the student's department. A research project will be conducted in conjunction with the internship. Oral Examination The oral examination committee will consist of the student's committee plus a dean's representative appointed from the graduate faculty by the dean of the Graduate School. This committee will conduct an oral examination at the conclusion of the research project and no earlier than the candidate's last semester of enrollment. The examination will consist of a defense of the project along with general questions on subject matter related to the candidate's field of study. Any candi-date who fails the oral examination may, upon recommendation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Time Limit The specialist in education degree must be completed within seven years following admission to the program. Students cannot include any course work on their program of study that is more than seven years old at the time of the final oral examination.22 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 THE DOCTORAL DEGREES PREPARATION FOR DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Prospective candidates are expected to hold bachelor's or master's degrees from accredited institutions, based on curricula that include the prereq- uisites for graduate study in the department of their subject. To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, the applicant must have a grade-point average of at least 3.0. Prospective candidates are urged to consult the department in which they wish to study for information concerning specific requirements. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (Ph.D.) The degree of doctor of philosophy requires distinguished attainment in both scholarship and original research. The degree is granted chiefly in recogni-tion of the candidate's high attainments and ability in the special field, as shown by work on the required examinations covering both the general and the special fields, and by the preparation of a dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. degree is expected to maintain a higher level of work than the grade-point average of 3.0 that has been established for the candidate for the master's degree. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION (Ed.D.) The degree of doctor of education attests proficiency in a program of graduate study in which the emphasis is upon preparation for competent perfor-mance in professional education. This program is intended primarily for students pursuing careers in which teaching, administration, or school services pre-dominate, rather than those in which research predominates. The Ed.D. degree in curriculum and instruction is offered in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction; the degree in educational administration is offered in the Department of Educational Management and Development. The requirements for doctoral degrees in the two departments of the Col- lege of Education have the following distinguishing elements: 1. The qualifying examination consists of a written and an oral section, both of which are administered prior to admission to the program. Successful completion of the qualifying examination is tantamount to acceptance of the student for doctoral admission. Residency of at least two consecu- tive semesters cannot commence until the semester after the qualifying examination is successfully completed. 2. Comprehensive examinations are usually administered three times annu- ally. The written examination tests the major and related areas of con-centration. Within two weeks after successful completion of the major and related area examinations, the student takes a comprehensive oral examination. Candidacy follows the successful completion of the orals. A student who fails any part of the comprehensive examination may present him- or herself for re-examination of the failed part of the exam before moving on to the next part. 3. The major area of study must be within the College of Education. A mini- mum of nine planned and integrated credits constitutes the related area and can be taken in any department of the university with the approval of the student's committee. The related area must be specifically planned with the major and minor departments in order for the doctoral fields to be mutually supportive. Any transfer credit or predoctoral course work to be included in the related field must have the approval of both the major and minor department at the outset. Specified course work in both research and statistics is required for this degree. Other requirements are described in the departmental sections of this catalog. DOCTOR OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Students enrolled in the Doctor of Economic Development are required to complete and pass their comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to complete an internship experience and a Project paper as defined by their program. They can embark on the Project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including ECDV 694 Internship and ECDV 699 Doctoral Project. A Project paper must be finalized using a similar submission process as the dissertation (see section Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation of the Graduate Catalog). On the front page, after the title of the paper, the student should indi-cate that it is a Project paper. Students completing Projects papers do not need to complete the Earned Doctoral Survey. The paper must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The form and style of the paper must comply with regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation/project paper-approval process as well as information on bind- ing. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The project paper is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. DOCTOR OF NURSING PRACTICE Students that hold a baccalaureate degree in Nursing are required to complete and pass all required course work for the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree program. They are also expected to complete and pass their compre- hensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to complete an internship experience and a project paper as defined by their program. They can embark on the Project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including NURS 698 Advanced Clinical Residency and NURS 699 Clinical Scholarly Project. Students that hold a Master's of Science in Nursing are required to complete all course work requirements, complete and pass their comprehensive exam, and complete a Project paper. To complete their Project paper, they must complete at least 6 credits at the 600 level including NURS 699 Clinical Scholarly Project. A Projects paper must be finalized using a similar submission process as the dissertation (see section Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation of the Graduate Catalog). On the front page, after the title of the paper, the student should indi- cate that it is a Project paper. Students completing Project papers do not need to complete the Earned Doctoral Survey. The Project paper must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The form and style of the paper must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed infor- mation on the dissertation/ project paper-approval process as well as informa- tion on binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The project paper is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. INTERDISCIPLINARY DOCTORATE Students wishing to study in the interdisciplinary doctoral degree program must apply and be accepted into a doctorate-granting department. The following requirements for admission to the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program have been established: 1. A master's degree or equivalent program of study that includes at least 30 credit hours of graduate course work with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. 2. Twelve credit hours of graduate course work must be completed at New Mexico State University in order to apply for admission into the interdis-ciplinary doctorate degree program. Additional course work is required for degree completion. 3. Evidence of outstanding academic achievement in graduate school.4. A written description of the program concept prepared by the student consisting of (a) areas in which competency is required; (b) proposed readings and course work and how these relate to required competen- cies; (c) objectives and an outline for thesis research; (d) justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. 5. The student must select an advisor from his or her department to chair the committee and, in consultation with the advisor, structure a commit- tee consisting of at least five faculty members from the graduate faculty list who are willing to work on the interdisciplinary degree program The committee must include at least two members from each of two doctor- ate-granting departments. The committee chair will convene a meeting to review and approve the proposed program. 6. Graduate Student Services will send an \"Admission Referral\" document, signed by all committee members, to the heads of all departments from which the student proposes to use more than eight credits of course 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 23 work, or from which faculty are requested to serve on the proposed committee. 7. Once the \"Admission Referral\" document has been approved by all departments, the committee chair will convene a meeting of the commit- tee to review the student's program and make changes as necessary. In addition, the committee will set the format and date for the qualifying exam. An effort should be made to incorporate the interdisciplinary nature of the program into the qualifying exam. 8. When the student has passed the qualifying exam and the \"Admission Referral\" memorandum has been approved by the respective depart-ment heads, the requirements for admission to the program are satisfied. Formal acceptance into a doctoral program may be required in order to receive financial assistance. 9. The number or courses required for degree completion will vary depend- ing on the student's program of study. Interdisciplinary doctorate degree students must meet the requirements for residency, registration, the comprehensive examination, the Final Examination, the dissertation, and the declaration of approved minor. Please see the \"Doctoral Degrees\" section of this catalog to review the full requirements for doctoral degrees. 10. The dissertation work shall include at least 18 credits of a 700-level course. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREES Qualifying Examination Doctoral students must pass a qualifying examination. This examination is scheduled by the student's advisor and is administered by the major depart-ment. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Scheduling the qualifying examination is based on the following criteria: (a) for students who enter the Graduate School with little or no previous graduate experience but wish to proceed directly to the doctorate, the qualifying examina- tion should be taken after 12 credits of graduate work; (b) for students who enter with a master's degree or equivalent from another university, or another depart-ment, the qualifying examination should be taken before the completion of one semester of graduate work. The department may allow the master's final examination to serve as the doctoral qualifying examination or may require a separate examination for stu-dents who earn their master's degree at New Mexico State University, and will continue in the same department. Based on the result of the qualifying examination, the department will take one or more of the following actions: (a) admit the student to further work toward the doctorate; (b) recommend that the program be limited to the master's degree; (c) recommend a re-evaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (d) recommend a discontinuation of graduate work. In all cases, Graduate Student Services shall be notified of the results of the qualifying examination. Upon passing the qualifying examination, the student will be admitted to the doctoral program. The student's advisor and department head will then appoint the doctoral committee to prepare the student's preliminary program of study for the doctorate. This program shall be filed with Graduate Student Services. Graduate Committee\u2014Doctoral The doctoral committee will be composed of at least four members of the graduate faculty holding doctoral degrees. The following rules apply to the com- position of the committee: In addition to the committee chair, at least one other member must be from a discipline within the student's major area, which may encompass more than one degree-granting department. One member of the committee may be from a related area of study other than the student's declared minor. If an approved minor is declared, at least one but not more than two mem- bers of the committee must be from the minor area. At least three committee members must be members of the graduate fac- ulty in doctorate-granting departments. Of these three members: The committee chair must be a member of the graduate faculty in the student's department (See the section \"Appointments Outside of Home Department\" in the \"Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments\"). The home department of no more than one of the other two committee members from doctorate-granting departments may be outside the stu- dent's department. As indicated in the \"Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments,\" any qualified member of the graduate faculty may join any graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which they are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the dean of the Graduate School. One member of the committee must serve as the dean's representative. The dean's representative can be either the member from the related area or minor area or an independent member appointed by the dean of the Graduate School but must not be from the student's department. In programs where more than one department is a participant, the dean's representative may not be from any of those departments. Departments may structure committees that include more than the mini- mum number of members as long as the stated conditions of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. All members of the committee will attend the comprehensive oral and the final defense for the dissertation. No change in membership of the doctoral committee may be made without prior approval from the dean of the Graduate School. Program of Study A student who has completed 12 credits of graduate work beyond the mas- ter's degree, or its equivalent, in residence at New Mexico State University, and has successfully completed the qualifying examination, should file the \"Program of Study and Committee for Doctoral Students\" form (also called \"Program of Study\") for the doctorate before registering for additional courses. This form may be obtained from Graduate Student Services, department offices, or from the website of Graduate Student Services: http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/ forms/index.html. The \"Program of Study\" should be completed in consulta- tion with the advisor and other members of the doctoral committee. This form should include the course number and abbreviated title with the credit hours. For courses already completed, grades must be shown for both major and minor areas. The program recommended by the student's committee is subject to approval by the head of the major department, the head of the minor department (if applicable), the college dean, and the dean of the Graduate School. The program of study should be designed to meet the campus residency requirement described in \"Residency\" and should include a minimum of 30 gradu- ate credits (from NMSU or other approved graduate programs) plus 18 credits of dissertation work (700-level course). Comprehensive Examination Before admission to candidacy for a doctoral degree, the student must pass a comprehensive examination intended to test knowledge of the major and any approved minor fields of study. The student will be admitted to the examina- tion after satisfaction of the language requirements (where applicable), after completion of adequate course work to the satisfaction of the major depart-ment and the Graduate School, and when considered by the committee to be adequately prepared. Graduate Student Services should receive the \"Program of Study and Committee for Doctoral Students\" and standardized test scores (if required by the department) after the student passes the qualifying examination and before the comprehensive examination. The oral examination form must be on file at Graduate Student Services at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. The examination must be part written and part oral. The results of the oral examination will be reported to Graduate Student Services. Any applicant for candidacy who fails the comprehensive examination may, upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean, (1) be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester or (2) be terminated from the doctoral program. The student must be duly registered for three credits of graduate course work in the Graduate School during the semes- ter in which the comprehensive examination is taken. A student taking an oral examination during the summer must enroll for at least one credit for that term. In general, there should be a time lapse of at least one year between the comprehensive and final oral examination. However, due to the type of research required in some departments and the method of administering the written com-prehensive in other departments, such a time lapse is not always practical. In all cases there must be one semester between the comprehensive and the final oral examinations.24 / GENERAL INFORMATION 2012-2013 Time Limit If more than five years have elapsed since the date of the comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the final examination. Advancement to Candidacy A student will be formally advanced to candidacy upon the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the recommendation of the com- mittee, and the approval of the graduate dean. A minimum of nine credits must be taken after successful completion of the comprehensive exam. A student may not register for dissertation credits (700) prior to successful completion of the qualifying exam. The dissertation prepara- tion shall total at least 18 credits of courses numbered 700. The doctoral commit- tee can impose additional requirements for courses numbered 700. A student is admitted to the doctoral program after successful completion of the qualifying examination. After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least three credits of dis- sertation or graduate course work each regular semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university, and, in order to resume stud- ies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at time of reapplication. Final Examination Every student working toward the doctoral degree will submit a disserta- tion embodying the results of original research. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate the student's ability in independent investigation and to be a contribution to human knowledge. The dissertation shall display a mastery of the literature of the subject field and present an organized, coherent development of ideas with a clear exposition of results, and provide a critical discussion of the limits and validity of the student's conclusions. When a complete draft of the dissertation has been prepared, the student's doctoral committee (appointed after the qualifying examination) will conduct the final examination. The final examination is concerned primarily with the research work of the student as embodied in the dissertation, but it may be much broader and extend over the candidate's entire field of study. The intention of the final examination is to verify that the candidate has a satisfactory grasp of the major subject as a whole and has a general acquaintance with the fields of knowledge represented by the course of study. The final examination is entirely oral and is open to the public. The final examination must be completed in accordance with the schedule provided in the academic calendar. The form requesting this examination is to be submitted by the department to Graduate Student Services ten working days before the examination is taken. This form may be found on the Web at http:// gradschool.nmsu.edu/forms-index.html and is also available from the Graduate School and departmental offices. The student must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the dissertation no later than seven working days before the date of the final examination. Any candidate who fails the final oral examination may (a) upon recommen- dation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester; or (b) be terminated from the doctoral program. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Registration during Regular Semesters and Summer Session After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least three credits of dissertation or graduate course work each spring and fall semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding sec-tion in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at time of reapplication. During spring and fall semesters the doctoral candidate must register for three units of dissertation or other graduate course work. The candidate must have also applied for the degree by filing the \"Application for Degree (Diploma)\" by the deadline specified in the academic calendar. If the final examination is to be held during the summer or the dissertation is to be completed during the summer, the student must register for one credit hour during the summer session in which the final examination will be held or the dissertation will be completed. In order to graduate in the summer the student must have filed the \"Appli- cation for Degree (Diploma)\" by the posted deadline for the semester in which degree requirements will be completed. Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation After successful completion of the final examination a copy of the disserta- tion must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The deadlines are posted to the Graduate School website at http:// gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm. The form and style of the dissertation must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation-approval process and binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for bind- ing by the binding section staff and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. Residency The requirements for the doctoral degree ordinarily cannot be met in less than three years following the bachelor's degree. The minimum campus residency requirement for the doctoral degree shall include enrollment in at least two semesters of classes taught by New Mexico State University faculty. DECLARATION OF APPROVED MINOR Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. The list of approved minors can be found in the Graduate Catalog in the section called Graduate Degree Pro-grams, Specializations/Concentrations, and Approved Minors. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and final examinations. FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS The Graduate School has no foreign language requirement. However, some departments require foreign languages for research. These requirements must be met before comprehensive orals are scheduled. For specific require-ments for each doctoral degree, refer to the departmental sections of this cata-log. RESEARCH FACILITIES The university recognizes and supports the concept of off-campus study and research as a valuable experience for graduate students. These experi-ences may take the form of internships, intensive study of specialized techniques with personnel at other institutions, and conducting research at specialized research facilities. Arrangements for such off-campus activities should be made with the student's committee and the graduate dean and should represent opportunities not normally available at this university. When the bulk of a stu-dent's research is to be conducted off-campus, both on- and off-campus advi-sors should be appointed and periodic meetings with the student's committee held to ensure timely progress. Such opportunities offer students considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable contacts between the student, the university, industry, and research institutions. Students are encouraged to pursue these opportunities with their advisors and the graduate dean. AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION The Agricultural Experiment Station is the research division of the Col - lege of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences. Faculty, profes - sional personnel, and graduate students conduct basic and applied research concerned with biological, physical, and economic phases of food and fiber production, processing, and distribution; consumer health and nutrition; and the social and economic aspects of rural living. Energy, environmental, and natural resource conservation aspects of these broad disciplines offer many opportuni- 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 25 ties for the graduate student to undertake meaningful research investigations in both the laboratory and the field. There are eight departments on the main campus with excellent laboratory facilities for research. In addition, the station maintains 13 field research centers including eight agricultural science centers, a forestry research center, a live- stock research center, an animal insect lab, and two research ranches. The station provides financial support to graduate research assistants and cooperates with research institutes at the university and with various state and federal agencies in providing opportunities for graduate research programs covering a wide scope of student interests.

The Public Service Career Showcase, held in November, has as its focus municipal, state, and federal government employers, while the Career Connec-tions and Employment Extravaganza, spring events, provide a look at National and Regional employers. Undergraduate and graduate students use career fairs to gather key information and discuss opportunities for part-time jobs, internships, cooperative education, and professional employment. Students wishing to further their education may wish to participate in the Graduate and Professional School Fair, which is held every fall semester. This event provides opportunities to discuss admission and degree requirements with representatives from diverse institutions located nationwide. Each spring hundreds of interviews between prospective employers and graduating stu-dents pursuing careers in education are conducted at the Educators' Job Fair. This premier event, co-sponsored by CS and the College of Education, show-cases approximately 100 public school districts from the western United States that are actively recruiting teaching and educational specialty personnel. Career Services provides an added dimension to the career planning activities of candidates who elect to use its resources. The staff actively sup-ports the efforts of students and alumni who are seeking suitable employment commensurate with their education and abilities.

STUDENT SPECIAL CARE POLICY To ensure the safety and well-being of its students, New Mexico State University may, on occasion, require that students receive a particular type of care or treatment (i.e., emergency medical attention, live-in attendants, or vac- cinations) as a condition of continued enrollment or eligibility to reside in univer- sity-operated housing. When this care or treatment is required by the cognizant university administrator, the student will be obligated to assume any financial responsibility associated with the treatment. Furthermore, the university may, on occasion, contact a student's parents, legal guardian, or spouse in cases of extreme emergency, or where a possibility of imminent harm exists. This will occur only when, in the judgment of the appropriate official, the best interests of the student and the university will be served. When practical, the university will, in writing, notify the student of the uni- versity's intention to undertake the steps authorized by this policy. This decision may be appealed by the student to the associate provost for student affairs and community colleges within 24 hours of notification. The appeal should be in writ-ing and clearly state the reason why the student objects to the proposed action. 2012-2013 GENERAL INFORMATION / 31 The associate provost will review the facts in the case and convey a decision to all parties within 48 hours.

Future professionals in integrated pest management will be ecologically oriented, trained to manipulate biological and cultural technologies while minimizing chemical control options. The Master of Science degree program in agricultural biology is designed to produce gradu-ates with the academic and research background needed to facilitate effective, innovative, and environmentally sound protection of plants and animals from a wide and varied spectrum of pests. Students will be prepared for careers in research, extension, teaching, private consulting, industry, and government or to continue in a broad range of Ph.D. programs. Specific opportunities will include positions as agricultural consultants, technical and sales representatives for industry, state departments of agriculture and USDA specialists, agricultural extension agents, and industry research and environmental technicians. There is currently a strong need for M.S. graduates trained in these areas, and the demand is expected to increase dramatically. Students may wish to concentrate their graduate program in entomology, plant pathology, or weed science, or conversely may wish to be broadly trained in all three pest-management disciplines. Most students will be expected to complete a thesis. A non-thesis option is available, depending on prior training and experience and subject to approval by the department head. A nonthesis research option requires completion of a research paper, suitable as judged by the student's graduate committee, for journal publication. Completion of an undergraduate degree essentially equivalent to that offered by the department is required for admission to the M.S. graduate program. Qualifications for admis-sion will be reviewed by the departmental Graduate Admissions committee. Prospective graduate students must have at least a 3.0 undergraduate GPA, complete the GRE, and submit an official transcript, a letter of intent, and three letters of recommendation.

The department has programs in plant sciences, environmental science, soil science, water management, natural resources management, and turf management. Students trained in these areas are in demand for U.S. and international positions. This demand is at all levels of training-B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. Therefore, the course work and original research in Plant and Environmental Sciences leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy are designed for and have proven to be successful in preparing students for commercial companies, educational institutions, govern-mental agencies, and private production enterprises. The student may emphasize study in several discipline areas described in the following pages. The agronomy section emphasizes sustainable crop production, plant-pest/disease/weed interactions, soil-water-plant relations, crop physiology, and breeding and genetics of cotton, alfalfa, maize and peanuts. The genetics section places special emphasis on genetic basis of agronomic or horticultural traits, applied bioinformatics, gene regulation and genomics. The environmental and soil science sections emphasize environmental quality and ecosystem services, bioremediation, recycling of organic wastes and waste-water, water use efficiency, soil-plant relations, soil-geomorphology and desert ecology, and the fertility, chemistry, physics, and microbiology of soils, including forest soils. The horticulture section emphasizes the creative use of plants by humans, and studies on the technical advancements in the husbandry of most economic commodity groups of fruits, vegetables, or ornamentals as well as managed turf. Emphasis may be in breeding and genetics of chile or onions, plant growth and development, nutrition, dormancy and cold hardiness, plant stress (water and/or salinity) response, fruit and vegetable physiology, forestry, and turfgrass. Most students will be expected to complete a thesis. The research detailed in a thesis should be of a scope and quality to merit publication in a refereed jour-nal. Depending on prior training and experience, a non-thesis option is available subject to approval by a departmental committee. The non-thesis option requires completion of a research project and paper of limited scope. In both the thesis and non-thesis options, suitability of the research project and resulting thesis or paper will be judged by the student's graduate committee. A minor is recom-mended and may be taken in chemistry, biology, molecular biology, environmen-tal management, applied statistics, toxicology or other areas. Prerequisite to major graduate work is completion of a curriculum essen- tially equivalent to that required by the department for the B.S. degree at New Mexico State University. Qualifications for admission will be reviewed by the departmental gradu- ate faculty. Applications should include a letter of interest. A 3.0 undergraduate grade-point average is needed for admission to study for the M.S. degree and a 3.3 grade-point average for Ph.D. studies. The department requires the GRE sores and three letters of recommendation, as well as the student's letter of interest as an admission requirement. Final acceptance requires that a graduate faculty member in the applicant's area of interest accept the student into their program. A student planning a program leading to a Ph.D. must satisfy one of the fol- lowing departmental requirements approved by the doctoral committee: 1. A thorough knowledge of a language other than English 2. A reading ability in two foreign languages3. Reading ability in one foreign language and proficiency with a research tool 4. Reading ability in one foreign language and one semester of supervised teaching experience 5. Proficiency with a research tool and one semester of supervised teaching6. Two semesters of supervised teachingA number of graduate assistantships are available each year. Inquiries should be addressed to the department. AGROnOMY AGRO 450. Special Topics 1-4 cr.

Semester Reviews At the end of the first two semesters, each graduate student's creative production will be reviewed by the assembled faculty. Participation in semester reviews are required for successful portfolio completion of graduate level studio 54 / ARTS AND SCIENCES 2012-2013 courses including: ART 550, 555, 560, 565, 570, 575, 580, 581, 585, 590, 595, 598 or other graduate level studio courses as determined the graduate advisor. Thesis Committee At the end of the third semester and after a successful candidacy the stu- dent will propose his or her thesis committee, consisting of three art department graduate faculty members, and one faculty member from outside the depart-ment. Candidacy Candidacy occurs during the third semester of study in residency. Candi- dacy consists of a formal review of the student's work by the full faculty. If suc- cessfully completed, the faculty will advance the student to her or his final three semesters of study. If the student is not advanced by the faculty candidacy may be repeated one additional time at the end of the next consecutive semester. The final three semesters of thesis work will commence from that point. Students who are not successful in their second candidacy attempt will be disenrolled from the M.F.A program. Thesis Exhibition The studio thesis will culminate in an exhibition of the candidate's cre- ative works and a written thesis statement. A successful oral examination and defense of the thesis and exhibition is required for graduation. Two copies of the thesis and a photographic record of the final exhibition are required; other requirements may be determined by the graduate faculty. Students who do not satisfactorily complete their oral examination may not participate in the thesis exhibition. Thesis exhibitions for the M.F.A. degree will be held in the spring semester in the University Art Gallery. Students who wish to graduate at mid-year are obligated to find an exhibition space other than the NMSU Art Gallery that meets with the approval of the graduate committee. In this case the student is respon-sible for making all arrangements for the thesis exhibition. Admission Admission to the M.F.A. program in studio art is based on an accredited B.A., B.S., or B.F.A. degree (or equivalent) with a major in art, including at least 45 credits in studio art courses and 15 credits in art history. Any deficiencies must be corrected by undergraduate course work to be completed before advance-ment to candidacy. Exceptions to these requirements will be considered by the area head and graduate committee. Students with an earned M.A. may be considered with the consent of the faculty, for advancement to candidacy for the M.F.A. degree upon completion of one semester or 9 credits in residence at NMSU. The number of transferable credits from a previous graduate program will be determined by the department head and the graduate advisor before con-sideration for candidacy. All applicants for admission to the M.F.A. program in studio art must submit 1. A CD/DVD with a PDF or jpeg portfolio of 20 images and an image list that identifies each piece by title, date, media and size. 2.

A reading proficiency exam will be arranged in conjunction with the major advisor. Admission to the M.A. program with an emphasis in art history is based on an accredited B.A. or B.S. degree (or equivalent) with a major in art history, includ-ing at least 33 art history credits and 9 studio credits. Undergraduate deficiencies must be completed before advancement to candidacy. Candidacy and Thesis Committee Selection Upon satisfactory completion of all required course work (except thesis credits) and foreign language requirement, the student will prepare a thesis proposal under the direction of the major professor. The student will then select the second member of his or her thesis committee and submit the proposal to this committee member for approval. With the backing of these two advisors, the student must then present the proposal to the department faculty. After a suc-cessful presentation, the student will advance to candidacy and select the third committee member, who may be from outside the art department. Admission All applicants for admission to the M.A. program must submit 1. A polished undergraduate research paper, 2. A written statement of intent, 3.

Holtzman, department head, Ph.D. (California- Santa Cruz)- populations in galaxies; R. F. (Indiana-Bloomington)- planetary astronomy and of galaxies; W. Webber, Ph.D. (Iowa)- high energy astrophysicsDEGREE: Master of MAJOR: Astronomy DEGREE: Doctor of Philosophy MAJOR: Astronomy MINOR: Astronomy The Department of Astronomy offers graduate work leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees. An undergraduate astronomy minor degree is offered as well. To be admitted as a regular student to the NMSU Graduate School as a major in astronomy, a student must present a suitable undergraduate background with emphasis (12-16 credits) on junior-senior level physics, and mathematics. The prospective student is also required to take apti-tude and physics (or approved specialized field) sections of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Information on assistantships and fellowships in teaching and research can be obtained from the department. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a committee that will guide the student in choice of courses, suggest training needed to remedy deficiencies and determine specific degree requirements in accord with the student's needs and objectives, and in agreement with departmental policies. The program requires 33 traditional course credit hours (11 classes), 4 seminar class credit hours, plus research in astronomy. Each student must demonstrate no later than during the second year sufficient academic and research ability to qualify for continuation in doctoral studies. It is possible, through arrangement with the Department of Physics, to obtain a Master of Science degree in physics during progress toward the Ph.D. in astronomy. See the \"Department of Physics\" section in this catalog for details of that program. The M.S. degree in astronomy is closely connected with the astronomy Ph.D. program, and questions concerning requirements should be directed to the department. Qualifying, Comprehensive and Final examinations are described else- where in this catalog. Questions concerning styles of the examinations should be directed to the department head. The department has access to several different observing facilities. The first is the Apache Point 3.5-m telescope, which is run by the Astrophysical Research Consortium and operated by NMSU. The second is a 1-m telescope also at Apache Point, which is solely owned by NMSU and has a wide-field CCD-imaging system. The third observatory at Tortugas Mountain has a 24-inch telescope with a CCD imager. The department is also a participant in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project at Apache Point Observatory. The department is home to NASA's Planetary Data System's Planetary Atmosphere Node, at which solar system exploration data are archived. ASTRONOMY ASTR 461. Astronomy for Teachers 3 cr.

Zeng, Ph.D. (Tel Aviv)- microbial infectious diseases and vaccine development DEGREE: Master of Science MAJOR: Biology DEGREE: Doctor of Philosophy MAJOR: Biology The Department of Biology offers graduate study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees. The Master of Science degree can be obtained through either a thesis option or a nonthesis option. Both options require 30 credits of course work.. The non-thesis option can be completed as an accelerated (one-year) program concentrating on biotechnology. To be admitted as a regular student to the Graduate School for a thesis- based Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degree in biology, an applicant must submit to the Department of Biology the following items (available as a PDF packet on the Biology Department's website): 1. a one- page written statement of educational objectives and research interests; 2. the Graduate Advisor form; 3. the Application for Financial Support if they wish to be considered for a graduate assistantship; 4. an unofficial transcript from all college and universities attended; 5. three letters of recommendation. 2012-2013 ARTS AND SCIENCES / 59 To be admitted as a regular student to the Graduate School for a non- thesis Master of Science in biology, an applicant must submit to the Department of Biology a one- page statement of educational objectives in lieu of item 1 above, and must also submit items 2, 4 and 5 above. Students interested in the acceler-ated non- thesis Master of Science must have also completed undergraduate courses in genetics and biochemistry. Prospective students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents must also apply for admission to NMSU through the Graduate School. Prospective students who are not in one of these two categories must apply through Interna-tional Student and Scholar service. Graduate Record Examination scores are not required by the Department, but if available the Department may use them to help assign the award of gradu-ate assistantships to entering students. These assistantships are awarded based on departmental needs and student merit; in general they are reserved for Ph.D. and thesis Master of Science students, and are not available to non- thesis Mas-ter of Science students. For the accelerated non- thesis Master of Science students, the courses are designed to prepare students for biotechnology- related careers in basic and applied research; in product development and testing; and in policy- making, regulation, and law enforcement. The program of study includes practical train-ing in molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics, statistical analysis, busi-ness, bioethics, and professional development skills. Additional graduate course work will provide students with further expertise in their individual areas of interest, including cell, molecular, and microbial biology; environmental, ecologi-cal, and evolutionary biology; and general and integrative biology. Students who complete this training will be prepared for successful employment in academic, corporate, and government settings. For other Master of Science studies and for the Ph.D., students can choose among the Department's three core programs of formal course work: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cell and Organismal Biology, and Microbiology. Mas-ters of Science thesis students and Ph.D. students in the Ecology and Evolution-ary Biology core program should consult with their faculty advisor in developing a curriculum plan. The Cell and Organismal Biology core program is appropriate for all graduate students who wish to emphasize those areas of biology that integrate function and structure in cells, tissues, and organisms. The graduate curriculum includes required and elective courses in cell and molecular biology, neurobiol-ogy, developmental biology, and physiology. Our goal is to prepare students for careers in this field through research experiences and formal coursework as well as through seminars and discussion groups. The Microbiology core curriculum is appropriate for graduate students who wish to specialize in areas of biology that study the various processes that occur in microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists) such as their physiology, ecology, development, or evolution. Students are expected to choose three 400-level microbiology courses and at least two 500- or 600-level courses to fulfill the graduate microbiology emphasis. Presentation of at least one formal seminar (i.e. an exit seminar) is expected. Graduate students may also take a minor in other graduate departments and programs. BIOLOGY BIOL 450.

Admission to these programs without deficiency is based on an undergraduate program essentially equivalent to that pursued by a chemistry or biochemistry major at this university. An entering student is encour-aged to take the Graduate Record Examination (aptitude) to increase his or her chances for financial support. All foreign students must take GRE and TOEFL and must demonstrate adequate English speaking and writing skills. Students who wish may take a minor in chemical toxicology or molecular biology. The core course work required of students entering with no previous graduate study in chemistry or biochemistry consists of basic core courses com-pleted in one of the following options: (i) two courses chosen respectively from two of the five major areas represented in the department apart from a student's elected field of thesis research; or (ii) one course chosen from the five major areas apart from the student's elected field of thesis research plus one graduate-level course in a discipline outside the Department of Chemistry and Biochemis-try. A master's candidate will plan an appropriate program of further study with his or her advisor and is also required to prepare a thesis. The thesis requirement may be waived upon application to the department head, after completion of the doctoral comprehensive examination requirements. A chemistry student who successfully completes the Ph.D. qualifying examination will begin writing the cumulative examinations, which constitute the written portion of the compre-hensive examination. A biochemistry student who successfully completes the Ph.D. qualifying examination will begin preparation of a research proposal which will be orally defended for completion of the comprehensive examination. After completion of the qualifying exam, a doctoral committee is formed to assist the student in planning a program appropriate to his or her background and goals. Since research is central in both the master's and doctoral programs, the early selection of a research advisor is encouraged. The student is expected to par-ticipate in the colloquia and seminar programs. Financial support is available to graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry through numerous teaching and research assistantships as well as federally supported traineeships and fel-lowships. Inquiries regarding these opportunities should be directed to the head of the department.CHEMISTRY CHEM 451. Special Topics 1-3 cr. Specific subjects to be announced in the Schedule of Classes.

The department offers specific expertise in several research areas, such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence and knowledge repre-sentation, software engineering and programming languages, computer and wireless networks, parallel computing, interval computations, algorithms and theory of computing. A number of laboratories have been established to coor-dinate research activities, including the Knowledge representation, logic, and advanced programming (KLAP) laboratory, the Programming languages, envi-ronments, and automated software engineering (PLEASE) laboratory, and the Game Design laboratory. The Department members are also directing the CREST Center for Research Excellence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, offering educational and research opportunities in bioinformatics. ENTRANCE REquIREMENTS FOR GRADuATE STuDY IN COMPuTER SCIENCE The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) General Test is not required for admis- sion; however, high GRE scores will strengthen a candidate's application and are highly regarded in the awarding of Graduate Assistantships. To be admitted without undergraduate deficiencies, an entering student must have completed undergraduate preparation substantially equivalent to that required for the Bach-elor of Science degree in computer science at New Mexico State University. Deficiencies should be satisfied as early in the student graduate program as possible, through the regular undergraduate courses, the C S 460- 469 transition courses, or through tests administered by faculty members in the relevant areas. Students should consult with their Graduate Advisor to address issues related to deficiencies. Deficiencies are also assigned to applicants whose transcripts denote low grades in selected areas. Admission is often denied to candidates with little background in Computer Science. Instructions for prospective appli-cants can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu. ENTRANCE REquIREMENTS FOR GRAD uATES STuDY IN BIOINFORMATICS The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) General Test is not required for admis- sion; however, high GRE scores will strengthen a candidate's application and are highly regarded in the awarding of Graduate Assistantships. Students wishing to enroll in the Master program in Bioinformatics must meet the following criteria: 1. Hold a BS degree, from an accredited institution of higher learning, in either a computational field (e.g., Computer Science) or in life sciences (preferably Biology, Biochemistry, or Environmental Sciences) 2. Hold a minimum grade point average of 3.2 Applicants will be expected to provide a Career statement, motivating the interest in bioinformatics and a minimum of three letters of reference. DEGREE: Doctor of Philosophy MAJOR: Computer Science Doctoral students may specialize in any of the areas in which computer sci- ence faculty have active research interests. Through interdisciplinary arrange- ments with other doctoral departments at New Mexico State University, doctoral 2012-2013 ARTS AND SCIENCES / 67 students may also specialize in such areas as computational biology, computer networks, and cognitive science. Doctoral students are expected to join the program with a preparation equivalent to that required for the Master's degree in computer science at New Mexico State University. The requirements for the degree are as specified in the NMSU graduate catalog, with the following additional considerations: The qualifying examination is implemented as a written examination, which examines the depth of knowledge in five areas of computer sci- ence. The five areas are Formal Languages and Computability, Analysis of Algorithms, Programming Languages, one between Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, and a fifth area agreed between the stu- dent and the department's Graduate Committee. Doctoral students are required to take the qualifying examination on or before the date indicated in their departmental admission referral. The comprehensive examination evaluates depth of knowledge in the specific research area selected by the candidate. The comprehensive exam includes both a written part, in the form of an extensive survey paper and an annotated bibliography, and an oral examination. The student is required to submit and defend a prospectus, at the same time or after completing the comprehensive examination. The prospectus describes and motivates the specific research problem to be addressed in the doctoral dissertation. Students should contact the department for information on additional graduation requirements, or visit the on-line Graduate Handbook (http://www. cs.nmsu.edu/). DEGREE: Master of Science MAJOR: Computer Science Each master's student normally must write a thesis (C S 599) or, with the advisor's permission, undertake a research project (C S 598). In either case, the number of required graduate credits is 33, including 6 for the thesis or project. In all cases, the students are required to sustain a final exam, covering the thesis/research project and the graduate course-work. The two parts of the exam bring equal weight. In no case may a C S course numbered below 500 be counted towards the number of credits. In particular, graduate students are expected to register for C S classes numbered 500 or above. The student's program must include: C S 510 C S 570 One of: C S 573, C S 574, C S 584 One of: C S 571, C S 575, C S 580, C S 581, C S 582 One additional course selected between: C S 550, C S 571, C S 572, C S 573, C S 574, C S 575, C S 580, C S 581, C S 582, C S 584, One additional computer science course numbered above 550 and differ- ent from C S 598, C S 599, C S 600, and C S 700. Courses not in Computer Science can be included in the student's program of study only if prior written approval has been obtained from the student's advi-sor and the departmental Graduate Committee. Further details can be found in the on-line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/). With the advisor's consent, the student may instead complete a course- work-only Master degree; this requires 36 credits of regular course work, satisfying the same requirements listed above, except that the 6 credits of thesis or project are replaced by 9 credits of courses numbered 550 or above and distinct from C S 589, C S 598, and C S 599. Students pursuing a coursework-only degree are expected to complete a written exam covering a selected subset of the students' plan of study.

Admission to the M.C.J. is competi- tive and prospective graduate students are expected to have at least a 3.0 under-graduate grade-point-average, coursework in research methods and statistics, and possess a bachelor's degree. Those not meeting these requirements may be admitted conditionally and required to make up deficiencies at the outset of their program of study. Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation and a three - five page essay introducing themselves and addressing the following topic: \"the most important change needed in the criminal justice system is...\" This essay serves as a sample of written work to be evaluated by the M.C.J. Graduate Committee. The GRE is NOT required for admission into the M.C.J. program. The M.C.J. Graduate Committee reserves the right to require a student to complete additional English writing coursework. After completion of all core course requirements, candidates declare their intent to pursue a degree option and complete all chosen degree option require-ments. There are two M.C.J. degree options: the thesis and focused coursework. The degree options are provided so that students may better match their educa-tion with career goals. The thesis option is often used by students interested in pursuing careers in basic and applied criminal justice research or a doctoral degree. The focused coursework option is often used by students pursuing administrative positions within criminal justice agencies. The Thesis Option is only available for Campus-Based students. Online students may only pursue the Focused Coursework Option. All candidates, regardless of chosen degree option, must complete a final examination. Examination requirements vary by degree option. Please contact the director of the M.C.J. program or consult the Department of Criminal Justice web site http://crimjust.nmsu.edu/degrees.htm for details. Thesis Option (33 cr.) Thesis students must submit a thesis proposal to their faculty commit- tee for approval and subsequently complete the approved thesis project. An approved thesis proposal is one wherein the thesis committee determines the student demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the nexus of theory, method, and policy as it applies to the proposed thesis project. At the discretion of the thesis committee the proposal may be considered inadequate and the student is required to revise and resubmit the thesis proposal until the committee determines the proposal is satisfactory. The final examination minimally includes a defense of the completed thesis, but may also include a general examina-tion based upon the candidate's program of study. The minimum coursework requirements are displayed below. Required Courses (21 cr.) C J 501, Research Methods in Criminal Justice or, ......................................................

A minor in Geo-graphic Information Science and Technology (GIS &T) is also available for all graduate students, regardless of major; details are provided below. Admission to the program is in accord with the general regulations of the Graduate School. Foreign students must receive a minimum score of 570 on the paper-based or 230 on the computer-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examina-tion. Any applicant who does not have an adequate undergraduate background in geography will be required to make up the deficiencies. Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation and a formal statement of intent to the department as part of the application process. The basic requirement for the Master of Applied Geography is a minimum of 30 graduate credits including 6 thesis credits. A non-thesis option requires 36 graduate credits with a minimum of 3 credits of professional residency and an approved final research report. All candidates must maintain an overall GPA or 3.00 or higher. All candidates must also receive a grade of B- or better in the following required courses: GEOG 501, Research Design; GEOG 585, Advanced Spatial Analysis; and one graduate-level GIS course either prior to entering the program or before graduation. A total of at least 15 credits must be earned in courses numbered 500 and above, and no more than 9 credits of the 30 (thesis option) or 36 (non-thesis option) can be earned outside of geography. The department is also a full- fledged sponsoring department in the recently approved interdisciplinary graduate degree program that offers both an M.S. and Ph.D. degree in water science and management. Program details, applica-tion procedures, and funding resources were still being finalized at the time this catalog went to press, but the program will be in place and accepting students in fall of 2012. Interested students are encouraged to contact the Department Head of Geography, Christopher Brown, at 575.646.1892 or brownchr@nmsu.edu, for more information. The department is also a participant in the Western Regional Graduate Program (WRGP) supported by the Western Interstate Commission of Higher Education. The WRGP is a tuition-reciprocity arrangement that enables students that are legal residents in WICHE states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) to attend NMSU and pay the resident tuition rate, instead of the nonresident rate that an out-of-state student would normally pay. The department has a contract research laboratory (Spatial Applications Research Center-SpARC) and a state-of-the-art computer teaching laboratory, both of which support the full suite of ESRI, ERDAS, and ENVI geo-spatial analyti-cal software. The SpARC laboratory employs graduate students who work with local and state governments and research agencies, as well as with businesses on applied geography projects. Our teaching laboratory supports graduate students engaged in course work and short-term research projects. The depart-ment has good working relationships with the Water Resources Research Institute, the Jornada Experimental Range, the Physical Sciences Laboratory, and other units on campus. The department has its own field equipment and field vehicle, which graduate students can use to support their thesis research. The potential for financial support exists for graduate students in geography through teaching assistantships and research assistantships. Inquiries regarding the program and assistantships should be directed to the Dr. Daniel Dugas, Geogra-phy Graduate Director (ddugas@nmsu.edu). Financial aid questions should be addressed to the Office of Financial Aid at NMSU.

The programs are designed to prepare students both for diverse careers in the public sector and for further training at the doctoral level. The M.P.A. program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), a dis-tinction held by fewer than one-quarter of M.P.A. programs nationwide. The M.P.A. program offers joint degrees with the Department of Criminal Justice (M.P.A./M.C.J.) and with the Department of History (M.P.A/ M.A. in Public His-tory). Students in a joint degree program can earn two master's degrees with fewer credits than would be required to earn those degrees independently. ADMISSION Prospective graduate students in either the M. A. or M. P. A. should dem- onstrate a 3.0 grade point average for the second half of their undergraduate course work. For students with a GPA of less than 3.0, GRE scores are required, though this requirement may be waived if the undergraduate degree was awarded more than five years before applying. Applicants to either program are required to submit an application for program admission (available from the department and on-line), three letters of recommendation, a writing sample, and a personal statement concerning their interest in pursuing a graduate degree. All of these items are to be submitted directly to the department. Additional information concerning program requirements and the admission process can be obtained from either the department's M.A. chair or M.P.A. director. Under exceptional circumstances the department may exempt students from the minimal requirements. Application for admission to the Graduate School should clearly indicate the program in which the student wishes to enroll. Students interested in a joint degree option must apply and be accepted in to the two departments separately, and indicate their interest on their applica-tions in one of the joint degree programs. GENERAL REquIREMENTS Students in both the M.A. and M.P.A. programs select either a thesis or nonthesis option. Students planning on continuing their studies in a doctoral program or wishing to establish expertise related to a specific career objective are strongly encouraged to select the thesis option. The nonthesis option is sug-gested for students desiring immediate employment or seeking to enhance their current employment situations. Course work outside the department must have prior advisor approval to ensure a well-integrated program of study. Complete information on the requirements for either program should be obtained directly from the department. Most M.A. and M.P.A. courses are offered in the evening. DEGREE: Master of Arts MAJOR: Government The M.A. program provides general course work in each of the major fields of political science. Students may choose either the thesis option, under which they complete 30 credits of course work plus 6 thesis credits (GOVT 599), or the nonthesis option, with 30 credits of course work plus 6 hours of special research credit (GOVT 598) or 6 hours of approved internship credit (GOVT 510). Both the thesis and nonthesis options require a final oral examination; the non thesis option requires a written examination as well. The program provides a broad-based foundation in political science while allowing students to pursue specific areas of interest. All students are required to complete a research methods class, either GOVT 502 or GOVT 503. In addition, students must take 3 of the fol-lowing 6 courses (9 credits): GOVT 530, Seminar in Public Policy GOVT 550, Seminar in American Politics GOVT 560, Seminar in International Relations Theory GOVT 570, Seminar in Comparative Politics GOVT 580, Seminar in Political Theory GOVT 590, Seminar in Public Law and Legal Systems The remaining credits required for the degree are selected subject to advi- sor approval to satisfy particular academic interests or career goals. Flexibility in planning a program of study is permitted to meet the educational needs of a diverse student population. Structured areas of emphasis are available in several topical areas including security studies, Latin American affairs, and international affairs. The study program for each certification area must be approved by the M.A. Program Committee. Information on these areas may be obtained from the Department of Government. No more than 9 credits taken outside the depart-ment will be counted toward the degree. DEGREE: Master of Public Administration The M.P.A. program is accredited by NASPAA. The M.P.A. is designed to provide students with the managerial and analytical skills, in addition to ethical and professional values, necessary to meet the increased demand for skilled public administrators. Candidates who follow this professional program must complete a minimum of 42 credits, consisting of core courses, electives and either an internship or a thesis. All students are required to complete a core cur-riculum of 18 credits, including: GOVT 502, Research Methods in Government GOVT 541, Public Budgeting GOVT 542, Public Sector Human Resource Management GOVT 544, Public Policy AnalysisGOVT 547, Government Organizations (Organizational Theory)GOVT 549, Ethics in Government The remaining 24 credits required for the degree are selected with the approval of an advisor to meet the needs and interests of the individual can- didate. Because students have divergent career goals, a thesis or internship option is offered. The thesis option requires an additional 18 credits of course work, 6 credits of thesis (GOVT 599), and an oral examination covering the thesis and course work. The internship option requires an additional 21 credits of course work, 3 credits of internship (GOVT 510), and an oral examination cover-ing the internship and course work. As part of the course work, students select-ing the internship option must take GOVT 519 (Proseminar/Capstone in Public Administration) during the latter part of their studies, and are required to earn a B- grade or higher in that course. With approval, students may include up to 12 credits of relevant course work from other departments to be counted toward the total credits required for the M.P.A. These credits may be selected to form a graduate minor in another academic discipline. Candidates with inadequate preparation for graduate study in public administration may be required to take appropriate undergraduate and graduate courses as part of, or in addition to, a regular program of study. Applicants to the M.P.A. program will be advised of any such requirements at the time of admis-sion. JOINT M.P.A.-M.C.J. PROGRAM The M.P.A.-M.C.J. joint degree option requires completion of a minimum of 57 credits of approved course work from the Departments of Government and Criminal Justice. Students interested in this option should meet with the M.P.A. director or criminal justice graduate advisor for additional information. JOINT M.P.A.- M.A. PuBLIC HISTORY PROGRAM The M. P. A.- M. A. Public History degree option requires completion of a minimum of 57 credits of approved course work from the Departments of Gov-ernment and History, including completing internship credits in both programs. Interested applicants should consult with the M. P. A. director or the director of the Public History Program for additional information.

Students complete a public history internship (3 credits) and preparation of an article of scholarly quality (3 credits). Students in the Public History specialization must collectively pass 18 credits of nonpublic history courses, including the nonpublic history seminars noted above. They must collectively pass 18 credits in public history, which must include the public history seminar, the internship, and the article. The scholarly article is developed through work in the internship and will be of peer reviewed journal quality. The public history credits may include a maximum of 9 graduate level (450 -and-above) credits outside the Department of History with permission of the Director of the Public History Program. A student choosing the Public His-tory specialization must pass an article proposal defense about the proposed scholarly article during the first semester after completion of the internship. The department will provide guidelines for the article defense. A student choosing the Public History specialization must give a public presentation of a portfolio that includes his/her work and the scholarly article, and must pass an oral exami-nation over graduate course work, the internship, and the article. Students who receive a Master's degree in this track will have a specialization in Public History added to their transcripts. Students choosing to pursue both the thesis track and Public History specialization must complete the course hours required for the public history specialization, perform an internship, and defend the proposed thesis before undertaking it using guidelines provided by the department, present the public history portfolio at a public presentation, complete the thesis, and defend their course work, thesis and public history portfolio at a final oral examination. In order to satisfactorily complete both programs, such students would complete 39 credits, including three hours of internship credit and six hours of thesis work. The Department of History and the Department of Government offer a joint degree in which students who are accepted into both of these programs may simultaneously earn both a Master of Arts in History degree with the Public History specialization, and a Master of Public Administration degree. The joint degree requires 57 total credits, while students who pursued both degrees as separate degrees would need to pass at least 72 credits. Students earning the joint degrees must pass a joint oral examination after passing required courses and completing internship credits in both programs. Students interested in the joint degree program should consult with the Director of the Public History Pro-gram and the Director of the Master of Public Administration Program. Students may earn a graduate minor in History by passing the following courses: Craft of History, one readings seminar from among History 590, 591, 592, and 593, and two additional 3-credit 500-and-above courses, for a total of 12 graduate credits. Graduate students in History must maintain a 3.0 grade point average in their History courses. A graduate student earning a C or lower grade in one His-tory course will receive a letter of warning. A graduate student earning two or more C or lower grades in History courses or whose History grade point average falls below 3.0 will be removed from the History graduate program. Students must earn at least one B or higher grade in a seminar during their first year in the graduate program, and must take at least one seminar during each year in which they are enrolled in the program. If a graduate student receives one U ( Unsatisfactory) grade on his/her thesis or internship, the student will receive a written warning, and if a student received two or more U grades on his/her thesis or internship, the student will be removed from the program.

For more information, see the Graduate School requirements in this catalog, and the Mathematics Graduate Student handbook at www.math.nmsu.edu qualifying examination: Every student admitted to the Ph.D. program must complete the Ph.D. oral qualifying examination. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the abil-ity to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Students who complete their mathematics master's degree at NMSU may request, at the time of applying for their master's oral final examination, that the Master's examina-tion also fulfill the Ph.D. qualifying examination requirement. In all other cases, towards the end of the student's first semester in the Ph.D. program, the student and his or her advisor will convene an oral examination with three examiners, the examiners being the advisor and some of the student's current or past instructors. As a result of the Qualifying examination, the department will take one of the following actions: (1) admit the student to further work toward the Ph.D.; (2) recommend that the student's program be limited to a Master's degree; (3) recommend a reevaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (4) recommend a discontinuation of the student's graduate program in mathematics. Written comprehensive examinations: Candidates for the Ph.D. degree must pass written comprehensive examinations in three of the seven areas of algebra, complex analysis, differential equations, logic and foundations, real analysis, statistics, and topology. To ensure adequate breadth, a combination of three comprehensive examinations must include real analysis, and at least one of algebra and topology. The seven examinations are based on the following comprehensive exami- nation sequence courses: Algebra (MATH 525, MATH 581, MATH 582), Complex Analysis (MATH 517, MATH 591, MATH 592), Differential Equations (MATH 518, MATH 531, MATH 532), Logic and Foundations (MATH 504, MATH 557, MATH 585), Real Analysis (MATH 527, MATH 528, MATH 593, MATH 594), Probability and Statistics (STAT 562, STAT 571), and Topology (MATH 541, MATH 542). Full time students should complete the comprehensive written exams in the first two years. Those who have not made substantial progress towards comple-tion of their written exams at the start of the fifth semester may be removed from the program. Students who have not completed the written exams by the start of the sixth semester will normally have any departmental funding revoked. Exams are offered every August and January. A student must register to take exams in the semester prior to taking the exams. A student has three consecutive examination periods to complete the written comprehensive exam requirements (Example: if s/he starts in August, s/he has the August, January and August examination periods to complete the exams). This does not extend the time limit mentioned above. Students will normally not be given more than two attempts at any one exam. Course requirements: Before graduation, a student must pass a total of four comprehensive exam sequences, but needs to take the comprehensive examinations in only three of them. In addition, a student must pass four more (one-semester) MATH/STAT courses from the seven comprehensive exam sequences listed above. A student may pass any of the four comprehensive examination sequences before enrolling as a Ph.D. student, but the four additional courses have to be passed after enrolling as a Ph.D. student. The following courses will not count towards the course requirements: Any course below MATH 501, 511 through 516, and MATH 563 through 569, MATH/STAT 540, MATH/STAT 598, MATH 599, MATH 600, MATH 700. Students and advisors are encouraged to consider further courses beyond this minimum. Foreign language examination: The department requires that each Ph.D. student pass a basic mathematical reading knowledge exam in a language, other than English, relevant to the student's research interests. This exam is coordinated by the student's advisor and consists of the open-dictionary writ-ten translation into English of a mathematical text of interest to the student. The language requirement must be fulfilled prior to the oral part of the Ph.D. compre-hensive examination. 90 / ARTS AND SCIENCES 2012-2013 Oral Comprehensive Exam: The student must take this exam at the end of the semester after completing the written comprehensive exams. The student should present a proposed direction for thesis work. Final Oral Exam: This should be an exam over the student's thesis and administered by the same committee of the oral comprehensive exam. MATHEMATICS MATH 451.

Integration of this knowledge into the context of complex living tissues interacting with the environment is the ultimate goal. This requires that the expertise from many diverse traditional disciplines be directed along converging experimental lines. The Ph.D. program in molecular biology is designed to facilitate an interdisciplinary approach to graduate research, utiliz-ing both traditional techniques and the latest advances in biotechnology, includ-ing the extraordinary power of recombinant DNA methodology. Participants in this program will take core courses in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Subsequent course work will be tailored for the individual student, depending upon his or her research emphasis. Participation in regular seminar programs will be expected to provide students with the widest possible scientific background. Financial aid, in the form of a limited number of MB teaching and research assistantships, is available on a competitive basis. Research Assistant-ships may also be available from individual faculty within the Molecular Biology (MB) program. Only the most competitive students are admitted with assistant-ship support. The MB program offers curricula leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the areas of biochemistry, molecular genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, bioinformatics, and microbiology. Admission to the MB Program without defi-ciency is based on an undergraduate program essentially equivalent to that pur-sued by an undergraduate major in chemistry, biology, agronomy, horticulture, biochemistry, or microbiology at this university. An entering student is required to complete the Graduate Record Examination (General Aptitude). Undergraduate deficiency courses must be passed with a minimum grade of B. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact at least three individual pro- gram faculty before applying to identify a prospective advisor and laboratory in which to pursue graduate research. Previous course records and GPA standings (typically minimum of 3.3/4.0), GRE scores (typically minimum of 1150 combined verbal and quantitative), TOEFL scores of foreign applicants (typically minimum of 550 on the paper-based or 213 on the computer-based), a letter of interest from the applicant that identified faculty laboratories of interest, and three letters of reference regarding research performance or potential are weighted heavily during the selection process. Students with a B.S. degree in one of the disciplines listed above can expect to earn the M.S. degree in about 30 credits, including at least 6 credits of thesis research. The Ph.D. degree can be earned in about 30 to 40 credits of formal course work, plus additional thesis research credits, for a minimum total of 75 credits beyond the B.S. Because research is central in both the M.S. and Ph.D. curricula, early selection of a research advisor is required. Ph.D. degree candidates will successfully complete a written and oral qualifying examination based on their proposed research and the subject matter in the core courses (below) at the end of the first year of study. Also at this time, the master's or doctoral committee is organized to assist in planning a program appropriate to the background and goals of the student. Ph.D. candidates will subsequently complete a comprehensive written examination and oral examination approxi-mately at the end of the second year of study. A final, formal presentation and oral defense of the original research documented in the M.S. or Ph.D. thesis completes the degree requirements. The Molecular Biology program also offers formal minors in molecular biol- ogy or bioinformatics. The molecular biology minor consists of 10 credit hours including MOLB 545; either MOLB 520 or MOLB 542; any of the tier II courses; and one MOLB 590 seminar. The bioinformatics minor is jointly offered with the Department of Computer Science and consists of 9 credit hours for Master's students and 12 credit hours for Ph.D. students, including MOLB 470, MOLB 452, and additional courses selected from those listed at http://research.nmsu.edu/ molbio/.

Wosick, Ph.D. (UC, Irvine)- sexuality, gender, family DEGREE: Master of Arts MAJOR: Sociology MINOR: Sociology While we offer a broad sociological curriculum, the Masters of Arts degree program in sociology has two natural areas of focus. Both have a strong socio- cultural emphasis based on strengths of the sociology faculty. Program focuses are: THE SOuTHWEST AND BORDER REGION Our unique location attracts faculty who are interested in peoples of the southwest, particularly Hispanics/Latinos and American Indians. In addition, our proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border provides an ideal laboratory for the examination of such issues as globalization, transnational migration and the con-sequences of border development. SOCIAL INEquALITY Our faculty members examine the intersection of race, class and gender oppression in their teaching and research, with special attention to educational, rural/urban, ecological and global disparities. One goal of this examination is to address social problems such as poverty and racial/ethnic inequality. The program is designed to prepare students for doctoral study in sociology and for employment in research and applied areas of the field. In addition to the on-campus program, we offer an online MA for students who are geographically distant from the NMSU main campus or who have full time jobs. Through small seminars, on campus graduate students engage in discussions of subjects that often result in thesis and internship topics. Regardless of course format, faculty members and students work toward the mutual goal of developing each stu-dent's full potential. Students seeking a master's degree in sociology should have taken one undergraduate course each in methods and statistics or their equivalent. Stu-dents who have not taken these courses should complete them before beginning their graduate study in sociology in consultation with an academic advisor. PROGRAM OPTIONS AND REquIREMENTS Graduate students in sociology have two program options, thesis or non-thesis. Faculty consider the student's special interests and career plans in advising regarding their choice of program options. The thesis option is typi-cally selected by students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree, while the non-thesis option is commonly pursued by those desiring immediate employment in research and applied areas in government, education, social welfare and health. The non-thesis, coursework only option is currently the only option available for on-line MA students. All students must pass a final master's examination. Thesis Program Requirements In addition to the successful completion of an acceptable master's thesis, students who choose this option will take a minimum of 39 credit hours of gradu- ate work distributed as follows: SOC 501, SOC 551, SOC 552, SOC 553 (12 credits total), to be taken within the first 18 hours of graduate credit. A grade of B or better is required to receive credit for each of these core courses. SOC 599 (6 credits) Thesis 21 credits of additional graduate course work to be taken in consultation with the sociology graduate student's advisor. Twelve of these 21 credits must be in 500 level Sociology courses. Final master's oral examination covering all general coursework and the thesis. Non-Thesis Program Requirements: Internship In addition to the successful completion of an internship and internship report, students who choose this option will take a minimum of 39 credit hours of graduate work distributed as follows: SOC 501, SOC 551, SOC 552, SOC 553 (12 credits total), to be taken within the first 18 hours of graduate credit. A grade of B or better is required to receive credit for each of these core courses.

SPANISH Department website: http://www.nmsu.edu/~langling/ (575) 646-3408 jelongwe@nmsu.edu J. Mexico) DEGREE: Master of Arts MAJOR: Spanish MINOR: Spanish The Department of Languages and Linguistics offers a Master of Arts in Spanish, which may be completed through our program on the main campus or completely online. Students are asked to specialize in either linguistics or litera-ture. For admission, students must satisfy general requirements of the Graduate School. Students must also complete a secondary admission packet which is detailed on our departmental website. The Degree Plan The degree plan requires a minimum of 36 credits in Spanish, of which at least 30 must be earned at the 500 level, and the remainder above the 450 level. The courses should be concentrated in the student's chosen area of study (linguistics or literature) as each student will be tested on a reading list that cor-responds to each area study. A thesis is optional. Students who authorized to complete a thesis may count a maximum of 6 credits of thesis work toward the degree. At the present time, the thesis option is not available for online students. There are no required core courses at this time and a student should work closely with his/her advisor and the Graduate Director to establish an appropri-ate individual degree plan. All students in either the on-campus or online program may complete a minor at the master's level by taking 9 credits (3 courses) at the 500 level or above, in another area (department) of study, or within the department itself. For instance, a student studying linguistics may wish to obtain a minor in literature or a student studying literature may wish to obtain a minor in linguistics. In either case, the minor credits count as part of the 36 total credits required for the degree. In all cases, the student should work closely with the Graduate Director to ensure his/her particular plan of study is acceptable to the program. Additional Language Requirement For both the on-campus and online degrees, the department requires that students fulfill a second language requirement (in addition to English and Span- ish) by following an approved course of study. Typically, this is completed by taking a four-semester course of study, but may vary according to the languages available. Options for completing this requirement include taking classes at a local Community College or University, or online. Some students have met this require-ment by studying abroad through NMSU. Students should consult the Graduate Director to establish a plan and discuss how this requirement will be met. TOEFL Requirement Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in English and meet all international admissions requirements prior to beginning their program of study. Please see the section of the Graduate Catalog on international admissions requirements. Final Examinations Students must successfully complete a final department examination (generally during the final semester of coursework) that is partially written and partially oral. Please consult the Graduate Director for specific information on dates and format for these exams. Areas of Interest/Reading List As stated previously, each student needs to select an area of interest- Lin- guistics or Literature. At the end of the student's degree, the final examinations (written and oral) will be based on the readings from the readings list in the stu-dent's selected area of study. For example, a student that has opted to specialize in literature is responsible for reading all the materials in the Literature Reading List section. Likewise, a student that has opted to specialize in linguistics is responsible for reading all the materials in the Linguistics Reading List section. The student is responsible for the reading list that was in place the year s/he started the program. Each student is responsible for covering the reading materials listed. Please contact the Graduate Director for a detailed reading. Note that the list is dated, so make sure to refer to the correct list that covers the year/semester the student started the program. The student is responsible for covering ALL the readings even if the student did not cover them as part of work done in class. Graduate Assistantships For the on-campus program only, the department awards graduate assis- tantships to qualified students. For this financial assistance, the student works up to 20 hours a week in departmental programs, chiefly in the teaching of elementary and intermediate Spanish courses in either the Heritage Language sequence or Spanish as a second Language sequence. Students interested in being considered for an assistantship should clearly state this interest in their introduction letter during the application process. The department offers a lim-ited number of assistantships, and students should remember that not everyone that applies for this award receives one. Maintaining the award depends on the student's successful performance both academically and in the classes he/she teaches and is evaluated on a semester-by-semester basis. Students that receive an assistantship are required to take SPAN 594 (see course description) as part of their degree plan in order to help them prepare for teaching classes at NMSU.

Mills, Tech)- (New C.P.A.- financial C.P.A.- taxation. DEGREE: of Accountancy MINORS: Accounting Information Systems MASTER OF ACCOUNTANCY The last decade has witnessed a tremendous expansion in the knowl- edge base required for accounting professionals. The business environment has become increasingly complex, as evidenced by the growth in the body of national and international accounting and auditing standards, taxation, SEC, and other regulatory requirements. The accountant must also be well versed in com-munications and analytical skills, computer-based information systems, profes-sional ethics, and global issues. Neither the traditional four-year accounting program nor the M.B.A. pro- vides the educational breadth and depth necessary to fully prepare students for the demands now imposed by many accounting careers. The major objective of the Master of Accountancy (M.Acc.) program is to provide for these increased educational needs and to prepare students more adequately for careers as pro-fessional accountants in financial institutions, government, non-for-profit organi-zations, and public practice. The program is designed to provide a technical and theoretical foundation in accountancy at the advanced level and yet allow the student to take courses to accommodate individual needs. The M.Acc. program is recommended for those students wishing to fulfill the 150-hour education requirement which most states, including New Mexico, have legislated as a requirement for taking the Uniform CPA Examination. Graduate assistantships are available for a limited number of qualified stu- dents. Interested persons are urged to apply well within the deadlines set by the Graduate School. Inquiries should be addressed to the Master of Accountancy Director. Admission requirements of the Graduate School must be met before the applicant may be admitted to the Master of Accountancy program. Consider-ation for admissions to the Master of Accountancy program is dependent on an applicant's undergraduate record and score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). Specifically, an applicant's undergraduate GPA is multiplied by a factor of 200 and the result is added to his/her GMAT score. The required total is 1100. Applicants scoring between 1000 and 1100 will be admitted to the program only with approval of the M.Acc. Admissions Committee. The min-imum acceptable GMAT score is 400. An acceptable score on the GMAT must be submitted at least one month prior to the student's first enrollment unless the student meets one of the GMAT waivers listed below. In addition to the aforementioned entrance requirements, an applicant's GPA in 7 upper division accounting prerequisites must be at least 3.0. For those students not receiving their undergraduate accounting degree at NMSU, it is expected that substantially all of the accounting prerequisite classes be from an AACSB accredited business school or the application will need to be approved by the M.Acc Admissions Committee. In this case the Admissions Committee may require that some of these prerequisite courses be retaken at an AACSB institution such as NMSU. All grades, including those from the first attempt at repeated classes, will be used to compute upper division accounting prerequisite grade point averages to determine admission to the graduate program. At the suggestion of any faculty member, the M.Acc. Admissions Committee will review the application of a stu-dent whose potential might not be accurately reflected by this calculation. GMAT waivers: The GMAT requirement is waived for those who: a. Are graduates of NMSU's Bachelor of Accountancy program with at least a 3.25 GPA overall and a 3.25 GPA in their eight upper division accounting courses; or b. Hold a recognized professional accounting credential (such as CPA, CMA, CIA, CFE); or c. Hold a post baccalaureate degree (such as MBA, MS, MA, JD) from an approved, AACSB-accredited U.S. university with a minimum of 3.0 in graduate course work. Candidates for the Master of Accountancy degree who have an undergraduate degree in accounting must successfully complete a minimum of 30 graduate credits. Qualifying NMSU undergraduate accounting students can apply to have two graduate courses count for their undergraduate program as well as their graduate program. Candidates with an undergraduate degree in a field other than accounting must complete additional prerequisite work dependent upon previous courses taken. In any case, all candidates must present or fulfill the fol-lowing requirements: Foundation Courses These courses are required of every student unless they can be waived. As a general policy, the courses upon which waivers are claimed must have been taken within seven years of enrollment in the program with a grade of B or better. A final decision regarding a waiver is based on an evaluation of each student's total educational and professional background. The following is a list of these courses (for a description of these courses, see the New Mexico State Univer-sity Undergraduate Catalog): ACCT 251, Management Accounting ACCT 252, Financial Accounting BCIS 338, Business Information Systems I BLAW 316, Legal Environment of Business ECON 251G, Principles of Macroeconomics ECON 252G, Principles of Microeconomics FIN 341, Financial Analysis and Markets MGT 309, Human Behavior in Organizations MKTG 303, Principles of Marketing BCIS 485, Enterprise Resource Planning; MGT 344, Production and Opera- tions Management; or MGT Project Management in OrganizationsCOLLEGE of BUSINESS Dean Garrey Carruthers Associate Dean Kathleen Brook Associate Dean Kevin Boberg Assistant Dean Andrea Tawney MBA Academic Advisor John Shonk 2012-2013 COLLEGE OF BUSINESS / 107 Accounting and Related Prerequisites (21 credits) In addition to the foundation requirements, each student must present or complete the equivalent of an undergraduate major in accounting. This requires, at a minimum, 21 credits of accounting above the elementary level. No coursework applied toward the M.Acc. degree, including the founda- tion requirements and the undergraduate accounting prerequisites, may be taken on an S/U basis. Core and Elective Courses (30 Credits) Core Courses: Each student must complete 18 credits in accounting courses numbered above 503. These courses must include a research class (either ACCT 555 or 564) and ethics (ACCT 559) unless a student has already taken an equivalent course. In addition, three of the credits may be in upper divi-sion undergraduate elective accounting courses numbered 450 or higher. Other specific courses to be completed by each candidate will be determined in the advisement process. Elective Courses: All students must complete a total of 12 additional credits in elective courses. Electives will be determined individually for each student and will include no more than 3 credits in accounting. At least 3 of the elective credits must be in courses reserved exclusively for graduate students and numbered 510 or higher. Neither ACCT 503 nor any course fulfilling the foundation require-ment may be included. The Graduate School requires that students maintain a grade-point aver- age of at least 3.0 in all courses taken as a graduate student, as well as a 3.0 grade-point average in all graduate courses taken as a graduate student at NMSU. The Department of Accounting and Information Systems requires, in addition, that every candidate for the M.Acc. degree maintain at least a 3.0 grade-point average in all accounting courses used to satisfy the core and elec-tive course requirement. M.Acc. students may not retake 500-level accounting courses for which they have previously received a grade without approval of the M.Acc. Admissions Committee. Comprehensive Examination Satisfactory performance on a comprehensive examination is required for the degree. Thesis: No thesis is required; however, under special approval, a candidate may elect to write a thesis under ACCT 599. Up to 6 credits may be earned for the thesis. Admission to Master of Accountancy Class registration in any Accounting course numbered above ACCT 503 requires 1. prior full admission to the M.Acc. program, or 2. prior consent of the Director of the M.Acc. program. MINOR: INFORMATION SYSTEMS) This minor is for master's-level students who are not in the Masters of Busi- ness Administration (MBA) program. Students in the MBA program may choose a specialization in Information Systems (see the Business Administration section below). To obtain a graduate minor in Information Systems (IS) students must satisfy the requirements as stated in the Graduate Catalog for a minor at the master's level. For it to appear on the transcript, the student must list the minor on the \"Program of Study and Committee for Master's Student\" (Application for Admission to Candidacy) and have it signed by the head of the department offer-ing the minor. The minor requires a minimum of 9 credits of graduate work. Two courses are required: BCIS 540 and BCIS 595. The third course BCIS 558, 560, BCIS BCIS 590. ACCOUNTING ACCT 451.

Although the program is designed to encourage participation by students with a variety of educational backgrounds, the curriculum is fast paced. As a consequence, a minimum level of background knowledge is expected of all entering students, and those who are lacking the necessary background in any of the knowledge areas indicated below will be required to make up their deficiencies early in the program. Effec-tive with Spring 2013 admission, students may not complete more than 9 credits of required MBA courses prior to completion of the background knowledge courses. Background Knowledge Background knowledge may be demonstrated by successful completion (with a grade of A or B) of undergraduate courses in managerial accounting, financial accounting, macroeconomics, finance, marketing, statistics, and cal-culus. At NMSU, the relevant courses are ACCT 251 and 252, ECON 251G, FIN 341, MKTG 303, A ST or STAT 251, and MATH 142G. Knowledge of each of these subjects may also be demonstrated by completing examinations as designed by the College of Business. For more information on examinations, contact the MBA Office. Required Course Work (36 credits) The MBA program consists of twelve courses beyond the background knowledge requirements. Eleven are required courses: ACCT MKTG 503, and B A 590. Students requesting transfer credit for any courses must submit appropriate, written justification, including course descriptions, syllabi, etc. The following course sequencing requirements must be satisfied: 1.

Three graduate degrees are available: (1) Master of Arts, (2) Specialist in Education, and (3) Doc-tor of Philosophy. The CEP Dept. offers a Counseling Program which leads to a Master of Arts in Counseling and Guidance. The program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). It prepares professional counselors to perform mental health counseling in agen-cies, hospitals, private practice and schools. Successful completion of the Coun-seling Program qualifies students to pursue licensure as clinical mental health counselors with the New Mexico Counseling and Therapy Practice Board and licensure as school counselors with the New Mexico Department of Education. The 60-credit counseling curriculum requires two years full time or three years part time study on campus, and covers the following areas: human development; appraisal; diagnosis; planning; addictions; research; and professional issues. Specialized training and supervised experience is offered in mental health agen-cies, hospitals, and in schools. The CEP Dept. also offers a Specialization in Guidance and Human Rela- tions that leads to a Master of Arts in Counseling and Guidance. It prepares professionals for guidance roles in the military, education, community agencies, corrections and other settings. The thirty credit guidance curriculum can be completed in two years of part time study. It is offered primarily through distance education, but includes some face to face instruction on campus. The Special-ization in Guidance and Human Relations does not prepare students for licensure as counselors, and is not accredited by the Counsel for Accreditation of Counsel-ing and Related Educational Programs. The CEP Dept. offers a School Psychology Program that leads to an Educational Specialists (Ed. S.) degree in School Psychology. The program has national approval through the National Association of School Psychologists. The program provides additional education beyond the M.A. to prepare professionals for licensure as school psychologists in New Mexico and throughout the United States. The School Psychology Program prepares its candidates to work with preschoolers, children, adolescents, and families. The various settings where School Psychologists are employed include public schools and other organiza-tions that require advanced assessment, counseling, consultation and other interventions. The program trains its candidates to serve students with diverse educational, psychological, and emotional needs from various backgrounds. Such training also includes working with all school personnel to help make education a positive and rewarding experience for their students. Currently, the program offers additional training for the development of bilingual School Psy-chologists through a personnel preparation grant. The CEP Dept. offers a doctoral Counseling Psychology Program that leads to a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. The program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (for more information on this accreditation contact the Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, APA, 750 1st Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202.336.5979). The program is based on the scientist-practitioner model through which both research and service delivery skills are acquired. Graduates of the program are prepared to conduct research, provide service, teach, and supervise. The program prepares students for licensure as psychologists. The three goals of the program are to: 1) Produce well-trained generalists in applied psychology capable of com- petently utilizing a wide variety of assessments, modalities, and types of interventions; and in disseminating psychological information. 2) Nurture active learners and critical/scientific thinkers capable of inte- grative thinking, application of theory, hypothesis generation, and self-reflection, and 3) To develop in students a contextual understanding of psychology and the environments in which they work and live so as to produce culturally-responsive, developmentally-aware, and strengths-based psychology professionals. CEP faculty conducts periodic reviews of students' progress in the programs, including their academic performance, counseling and psychoeducational skills, professionalism, and ethics. An interview is required as part of the review. Deficits identified through faculty reviews may result in recommendations that students engage in remedial work or that they pursue alternative career goals. For information on admission procedures and requirements of degree programs in Counseling and Educational Psychology, contact the department office. Test scores on the Graduate Record Examination (aptitude) are required of all applicants. Other requirements include but are not limited to the following: COLLEGE of EDUCATION Dean Michael Morehead Associate Dean Robert Rhodes Associate Dean for Research Karin Wiburg Assistant Dean for Budget and Planning Gladys De Necochea Director of Education Research and Budget Juanita Hannan 2012-2013 COLLEGE OF EDUCATION/ 121 application and fee, official transcripts, three letters of recommendation, let- ter of intent, statement of purpose, and list of completed upper-division and/or graduate course work related to counseling, school psychology, or counseling psychology.

The department offers programs leading to the Master's degree. The M.A. in education with emphasis in special education can be earned with the follow-ing emphasis: general special education (i.e., noncategorical), mild-to-moderate disabilities (behavior disorders, learning disabilities, and mental retardation), early-childhood special education, bilingual special education, special education administration, deaf/hard-of-hearing education, and educational diagnostics. Students who have earned a bachelor's degree and who are seeking special education licensure must enroll in a graduate degree program. Depending on the individual student's needs and experiences, programs can be designed to lead toward special education licensure, specialization in categorical areas, educa-tional diagnostician licensure, or administrative licensure. The M.A. in Communication Disorders offers a specialization in speech- language pathology. The program is designed primarily for students who are interested in becoming speech-language pathologists in schools, hospitals, com-munity-based clinical facilities, or private practice. The programs for students entering without a communication disorders background are generally one year longer. The programs are designed to provide the academic background and clinical-practicum experience for meeting state and national certification and licensure requirements. The master's degree program in speech-language pathology is accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Enrollment in graduate courses in communication disor-ders is limited to individuals in good standing in the Graduate School. In addition, the licensure courses in the communication disorders curriculum are restricted to CD majors. To complete a course of study, each student must meet the pro-gram's academic and clinical competency criteria, as well as the recommenda-tion of state and national certifying bodies for educational licensure and clinical certification. Only those courses in which a grade of B or higher has been earned will apply toward the program of study. If a student earns lower than a B grade in any course, he or she will meet with the Communication Disorders Graduate Faculty Selective Review Committee to determine a consequential course of action before proceeding with the next module of the program. Admission to the department's M.A. programs is based on the evaluation of a portfolio of materials that includes: Undergraduate GPA Graduate GPA (if applicable) Psychometric score on the Miller Analogies Test or the Graduate Record Exam (aptitude portion) for SPED program applicants Psychometric score on the Graduate Record Exam (aptitude portion) for CD program applicants An academic vita A one-page letter of interest in which the candidate cites relevant back- ground experiences and personal motives for applying to the program Three letters of reference Other optional materials (as available) such as samples of writing, evi- dence of scholarship, indication of membership in a group traditionally underrepresented in graduate programs, or extenuating factors high-lighted by applicants in their letters of interest. The department offers three advanced degrees in curriculum and instruc- tion with emphasis in special education: the Specialist in Education (Ed.S.), Doc-tor of Education (Ed.D.), and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The Ed.S. provides additional study beyond the M.A. to prepare the student for leadership roles within his or her field. An Ed.S. degree can be earned in School Psychology. An Ed.S. project is required. The Ed.D. program is designed to provide advanced professional training and to develop further ability in the scholarly study of professional problems. This program is intended primarily for students pursuing careers that emphasize teaching, administration, and service delivery. The Ph.D. program has a theoretical and research orientation requiring the student to demonstrate competency with two of the following research tools: (a) advanced statistics, (b) computer language, and (c) foreign language. The residency requirements for the Ed.D. and Ph.D. are described in the section \"Requirements for Higher Degrees.\" 'Three years' teaching experience, or the equivalent, is required for admission to doctoral programs.

ENVE, and the Ph.D. degrees. Among the currently active areas are environmental (water and wastewater treatment, hazardous waste, and site remediation); geotechnical (experimental soil mechanics, foundations, and other geosystems, and pavement geotechnics); water resources (surface and ground water, irrigation and drainage, erosion and sediment transport); hydraulics (open channel and structures); structural mechanics (emphasis on bridge design and inspection); structural design, and structural health monitoring/NDE. The department has excellent facilities including some 15 teaching and/ or research laboratories with facilities for mechanical, chemical, and biologi-cal research. The outstanding feature of the program is the energetic, highly motivated faculty and the low student-faculty ratio. The department currently has several ongoing research projects of various size and scope employing gradu-ate students. Office space is normally provided for those students pursuing an advanced degree. Teaching and research assistantships are available to quali-fied students. Students enrolling for graduate work in civil engineering must have received a bachelor's degree in engineering or one of the allied fields. A candi-date for the master's degree may choose either a thesis or a nonthesis option. When a student enrolls for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee is formed to assist the student in planning a program appropriate to the student's background and goals and to administer the required examinations. All Ph.D. candidates in civil 2012-2013 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING/ 143 engineering must have a demonstrated proficiency in English and two research tools. Mutual understanding between the Ph.D. candidate and his or her doctoral committee on the final nature of these two research tools will be on an individual basis.

DEGREE: Master of Science in Environmental Engineering Environmental engineering at New Mexico State University provides unique educational and research opportunities at the graduate level in the fields of water quality, water treatment, water pollution control, wastewater treatment reclamation and reuse, industrial, hazardous and solid waste management, groundwater treatment, air pollution control; waste minimization and pollution prevention. Therefore, course offerings have been developed to emphasize basic engineering and scientific principles, as well as design and application of environmental engineering unit operations and processes. Special problem and thesis research are closely matched with faculty expertise and the programs and professional goals of the graduate students. Study and research programs are specifically designed for individual students, taking advantage of not only the program capabilities, but complementing activities of the university as a whole, the student's professional experience and work environment. Graduate students satisfy degree requirements in environmental engi- neering by completing specific core course work. Course work in the graduate program includes: water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste systems design, environmental chemistry, environmental microbiology, environ-mental contaminant analysis, industrial pollution control, fate and transport of pollutants in engineered and natural systems and water quality in surface water and groundwater systems. Additional topics of interest to the students are cov-ered through special topics classes and by courses taught outside of the College of Engineering. The M.S. program requires either a thesis or a non-thesis practice oriented experience. The non-thesis option is designed for students that are working full time in engineering practice, but is also available to other students interested in pursuing a non-thesis option. The thesis option consists of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours, including 6 credit hours of thesis. Students who are work-ing full time in engineering practice may apply for the non-thesis option. This option consists of 30 semester credit hours of which up to 3 credit hours can be awarded for a professional engineering design experience (ENVE 590) and up to 6 credit hours can be awarded for an engineering practicum (ENVE 598). Trans-fer credit for courses taken elsewhere is evaluated on an individual basis. Up to six semester hours of graduate level courses taken may be used to satisfy M.S. degree requirements provided that the credits were not used toward another degree. REquIRED CuRRICuLuM The graduate environmental engineering program of the CAGE department expects all M.S. and Ph.D. students to meet certain requirements in pursuit of an advanced degree. Some of these requirements are related to the quantity, level, and quality of coursework. This Graduate Catalog details what is expected as a minimum for graduation, but it is up to the student and his/her advisor and gradu-ate committee to determine the plan of study for the student. The student and his/her advisor will create this program of study in the first semester of graduate work.Students desiring to work toward an advanced degree in environmental engineering must have completed undergraduate preparation similar to that required for a Bachelor of Science degree in an ABET accredited engineering program or must have adequate background, as determined by the graduate faculty of the program. The program administrator will approve exceptions to these requirements. The environmental engineering faculty will form a committee for every entering student. The faculty will evaluate the student's record and determine which deficiencies and/or core courses, if any, are needed by the student. For all professional non-thesis programs, the department head will review the commit-tee's decision. In order to provide consistency among plans of study for graduate students and to set a minimum set of core or pertinent courses, it is the policy of the graduate environmental engineering program that each graduate student will fulfill the following course requirements (or equivalent). Required Background Courses The following courses may be required if the student did not take a similar course at the undergraduate level, as negotiated with the general faculty com- mittee.

Credits of E E 590, Selected Topics, are limited to a total of 9, of which at most 6 may be credits for courses that don't appear as regular classes in the printed schedule. Each area of spe-cialization may have additional requirements for students in those areas. Other limitations and requirements that apply to all master's degrees are described elsewhere in this catalog. B.S./M.S. PROGRAM This program option is designed to provide a means for ECE undergradu- ates to obtain both a B.S.E.E. and a M.S.E.E. degree with 154 credit hours of coursework (normally: B.S.E.E. = 130 hours, M.S.E.E. = 30 hours; total =160hours). Students electing to utilize this option will follow the existing undergraduate curriculum for the first seven semesters. In the final undergraduate semester, two graduate courses (>450 level) will be taken in lieu of two ECE electives listed in the undergraduate curriculum. The student receives a B.S.E.E. degree at this point. A M.S.E.E. program can be completed in three additional semesters. Stu-dents must obtain prior approval of the department before starting this program option. GRADuATE CORE COuRSES AND BREADTH ELECTIVES The M.S.E.E. program requires students to participate in one semester of research seminars (E E 501, 1 cr.) and take two graduate core courses from two different areas of emphasis. In addition, either a third graduate core course OR one graduate breadth course must be taken from a third area of emphasis. If a student wishes to pursue a Ph.D., the third class should come from the core class list as preparation for the Ph.D. qualifying exam. The graduate core courses, specialty areas, and credits are listed below for the Graduate Core Courses and the Graduate Breadth Electives: Graduate Core Courses: E E 515, Electromagnetic Theory I (Electromagnetics) ........................................ 3 cr.

DNP: The Doctorate in Nursing Practice (DNP) prepares individuals who can assume advanced nursing practice roles within the health care arena in the areas of family psychiatric/mental health, adult/geriatric, and public/community health nursing. The focus of the DNP is on advanced nursing practice nursing directed towards improving nursing care outcomes for individuals, families, communities, and systems. The program emphasis is on cultural competence, evidenced-based practice, and translation of research to practice as it relates to improving the care of individuals, families, groups, and communities experienc-ing or at risk for health disparities. The complexity of health care combined with rapidly increasing knowledge and the need for both evidence-based practice and translation of research to practice support the goals of the doctorate of nurs-ing practice (DNP). Ph.D.: The intent of the nursing Ph.D. program is to prepare individuals who can assume leadership roles in academia, including the scholarship of teach-ing, research, and professional service activities. The focus of the program is on nursing scholarship to facilitate development of new knowledge and nursing education directed at improving nursing care outcomes for individuals, families, communities, and systems. Holistic nursing scholarship as it relates to improving the care of individuals, families, groups, and communities experiencing or at risk for health disparities is the emphasis of the program. Holistic nursing scholarship acknowledges the interrelationship of mind, body, and spirit with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. An empowerment/social justice framework guides the distinctive emphasis on border and international context. Admission to the Ph.D. and DNP programs is in accordance with the gen- eral regulations of the Graduate School. Additional requirements include: a MSN from an accredited college or university (for the Ph.D. program); a BSN from an accredited program for the BSN to DNP; and a MSN with clinical certification in a nursing specialty area for the MSN to DNP; successful completion of an upper division statistics course for the DNP program and a graduate level statistics course for the Ph.D. program (taken within the last five years); three professional letters of recommendation; a letter stating personal goals for graduate education, completions of writing requirement, interview with nursing faculty, resume iden-tifying practice experience; and proof of licensure or eligibility for licensure as a Registered Nurse in any of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, or U.S. territories. For the DNP program, students must also take courses in advanced pathophysiology, advanced assessment, and advanced pharmacology in addi-tion to specialty courses within their area of study. The focus of specific clinical experiences varies with student interest and in consultation with faculty advi-sors. Students in the DNP program complete a Scholarly Project.
