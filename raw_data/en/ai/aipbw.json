As much as it is easy to separate our body from our mind and spirit for ease of understanding, in reality we function as one complex and highly coordinated dynamic system. The directives that our cells receive come from our DNA yet we now have epigenetic evidence that DNA is in turn influenced by our beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, feelings and experiences. With this in mind, true holistic health paradigms need to factor in an understanding of each person's unique inner life, stresses and everyday experiences in order to foster true healing. In contrast, most modern medical approaches tend to focus on the physical body and ignore the more subtle aspects of the human being - such as emotions, mindset and spirituality. Disease and dysfunction can originate or manifest in any layer of our being - but tends to only come to our awareness when we get physical symptoms. By identifying and working with all aspects of the human being - body, mind and spirit - we can uncover the underlying dysfunction and root cause of disease . When we remove the blocks that are preventing health and balance, we create the potential for lasting change and true healing. Karen has trained in and uses a range of mind-body techniques and philosophies to support deep healing of the body, manage stress and improve our mindset and quality of life. These include: - Holistic counselling [Psych-K](https://www.karenmcelroy.com.au/services/mind-body/psy-k/)(Psychological Kinesiology) - Biofield Tuning Emotional Healing - Guided meditations and breathwork - Body based emotional release work (including dance therapy) - Soul journey and shamanic energy medicine (Celtic tradition) - Anthroposophy and life biography work Different techniques are indicated for different conditions and Karen is always sensitive to each person's cultural background, life history, spiritual beliefs and personal preferences when designing the best mind-body healing approach. I find our bodies very effectively tell our stories and mirror our beliefs through the symptoms, signs and illnesses we experience. Most of the time we are unaware of this link and so we poke and prod our physical bodies, aiming to reduce or suppress our symptoms as quick as possible through medications. However, when we do this we often shoot the messenger before it has delivered the message! Then next time the message has to be louder and potentially more destructive - to get our attention. By learning to listen to our body, heal our experiences and integrate our emotions on a regular basis, we create the foundations for true health and wellbeing. Karen McElroy After studying and exploring many traditions and techniques over the years, and attending trainings with world-leading mind-body experts such as Dr Bruce Lipton, Gregg Braden and Dr Joe Dispenza, Karen offers an accessible and down-to-earth approach to mind-body medicine, mindfulness and spirituality. Everyone can benefit from exploring this aspect of health and wellness regardless of their prior experience or beliefs. Individual sessions as well as comprehensive healing and wellness programmes and private retreats are available with Karen to get to the root cause of your illness or issues and facilitate the health, healing and happiness you desire. A few happy clients I feel as though the penny finally dropped and have felt so much calmer since working on my old limiting beliefs. I can't even describe the relief I feel from this internal struggle having woke up today and it being gone. Thanks for being a part of my journey. I am forever grateful. I always knew, that my emotions and beliefs were contributing to my health, but I didn't know why, how or even where to start. Then I met Karen! I have been working with Karen for over a year now in both the mind and body space and absolutely love it! Karen is one of the first practitioners that has really taken the time to understand me as a whole person and not just treat the physical symptoms I'm experiencing. I've especially benefited from Quantum Healing and spiritual healing sessions with Karen. She is really understanding and empathetic and has helped me explore my thoughts, feelings and beliefs in a safe and nurturing environment. I always feel a change in my energy levels and consciousness after a healing session with Karen, particularly when we have been able to break-through to the root cause of an issue. It really does feel like 'nourishment for my soul' and I am so grateful. I have been so grateful to work with Karen and always come away from a session feeling inspired and more light. Karen always helps me to explore the underlying patterns of whatever is going on for me, and is able to take me into a space that allows me to get my 'Aha!' moments that always initiate a change. I love having a naturopath that can treat me on all levels and not just the physical. Sometimes Karen gives me flower essences or has used card readings to complement my treatment, and I always feel like my sessions are really personalised. I highly recommend Karen as a naturopath and healer! I would like to share how helpful my counselling sessions have been with Karen. She has really helped me to explore my inner life and get in touch with my feelings, beliefs and programmes that are often hidden from my everyday mind. Using techniques like Psych K and other processes, I have been able to get out of stuck patterns and have accessed more clarity and calm in myself. My relationships have also improved and I feel much more aligned with my life and my work. I always feel like Karen is 100% present and she has a lovely caring and kind attitude that makes this kind of work easy to do. Thank you Karen!
