It must be addressed systematically. A detailed and comprehensive assessment is essential. We look at the individual holistically and achieve as much of the contributing layers of history as possible. A child might have had an event which triggered autistic symptoms. These may include physical events or trauma, displacement, second-hand stressors such as parental traumas or stressors, and any amount of instability in the home or support system or lack thereof in which the child felt helpless.

We identify family support which is vital and provide dietary education to family. - Dietary guidelines so as not to stimulate fungal overgrowth - Dietary guidelines for children with sulfation or genetic SniPs - Dietary guidelines that avoid inflammatory or sensitizing foods We provide appropriate methods of detoxification to the most sensitive and complex children.
