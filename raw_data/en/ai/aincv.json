Surveys were completed during breeding season. Winter bird surveys with a focus on raptors were also conducted, as well as spring migration surveys. Preliminary fall migration surveys were conducted in 2012 at the edge of the site property. Breeding birds were surveyed using point counts distributed around the proposed turbine locations, while migration and winter surveys were conducted along a walked transect route along the access road and passing through the site. A total of 48 species were observed during the surveys, of which 29 are confirmed or evidently breeding on or near the project site. All of the species observed during the migration surveys are known to breed in the region; it was not evident that the area serves as a significant migration stopover. Breeding status was inferred from observed behavior during the June and July breeding bird surveys and incidental observations . Three species were confirmed to be breeding in the area by presence of fledged young and observations of adults carrying food, and a further 8 species are considered \"probable\" breeders based on territorial behaviour (observed in suitable habitat on two or more occasions over the breeding season), agitated behaviour of adults, and/or presence of a breeding pair in suitable habitat. A nother 18 species , which are considered \"possible\" breeders, were heard or observed only once in a particular location in suitable breeding habitat. One federally listed species at risk, the Olive -sided Flycatcher , was observed during the summer breeding s urveys. Five additional species considered regionally rare by ACCDC were observed: Gray Jay, Goshawk, Yellow -bellied Flycatcher and Boreal Chickadee. Based on observed species use of the site to date, there appears to be relatively little risk of bird mortality due to collisions with the wind turbines at the Project Area, since the site does not appear to be part of a major migration corridor. Species that engage in aerial displays which would put them at greater risk of collision were not observed at the site. Only two raptor species were observed during the field surveys, the Red-tailed Hawk and Northern Goshawk . Disturbance through displacement and habitat loss are considered to be of minor concern at this site; the habitat types found in the Project Area are not unique to the region, and the proposed wind farm consists of just two turbines.

In order to provide a complete assessment, AMEC has conducted a desktop data review for bird species in the region , and has designed and implemented a survey plan for pre-construction baseline avian surveys . This report summarizes the results of the data review and surveys conducted to date at the proposed wind farm site. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) what species make use of the habitat at the proposed wind farm site at different times of year; 2) of the species present at the site, which may be most susceptible to collision with turbines based on flight height and behaviour; 3) the peak spring and fall migration periods at the site, based on bird abundance and species diversity; and 4) whether any species at risk or species of conservation concern make use of the proposed site during migration or for breeding. All avian surveys were conducted by AMEC biologist Maureen Cameron-MacMillan. 2.0 METHODS 2.1 DESKTOP REVIEW Prior to conducting field surveys, aerial photographs of the site were reviewed to determine appropriate survey sites that would ensure all representative habitat types within the proposed project footprint were surveyed. The Important Bird Area (IBA) database was consulted to determine whether known areas with significant attributes for birds exist near the project site. As well, a list of bird species known or suspected to be breeding in the area was obtained through the Maritimes Breeding Bird Atlas (MBBA), and the Christmas Bird Count (CBC) database was consulted to obtain records of wintering bird species in the region. 2.2 FIELD SURVEYS 2.2.1 Survey Methodology For the breeding bird surveys, a \"point count \" survey consisting of ten minutes of silent listening was conducted at the proposed turbine locations , as well as one \"control\" location more than 500 m from the turbines along the site access road . The point count surveys were conducted on two occasions during the breeding season. A ll visual and auditory (songs and calls) observations of birds within 100 m of the observer were recorded , along with the number of individuals and breeding evidence using Bird Studies Canada and MBBA criteria. Surveys were conducted in the early morning, and only during suitable weather conditions (i.e., not during sustained precipitation or on windy days) to maximize probability of detection. For migration surveys and winter resident surveys conducted in 20 13, a 1 km transect route , selected to be representative of the habitat on the site, was established along the site access road. Transect surveys took place in the morning or early afternoon . The route was traversed on foot with frequent listening stops, and all birds seen or heard were recorded. Weather Barrachois Pre-Construction Avian Surveys Natural Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 2 conditions, bird species and numbers, and behaviour (in particular, the height of birds in flight around the proposed turbine locations) were noted. Surveys for winter resident species incorporated a particular focus on raptors. During the spring migration surveys, a nighttime survey for nocturnal species including owls and nighthawks was conducted; this survey employed playback of target species to increase the probability of detection. In fall of 2012, prior to construction of the site access road, preliminary fall migration surveys were conducted at the property boundary approximately 400 m west of the proposed Turbine 1 location, in a cleared area around a cellular tower. 2.2.2 Survey Timing Winter bird surveys were conducted on January 29th and February 21st, 2013. S pring migration surveys were conducted on May 16th, May 31st and June 8th. At each of the point count locations, t wo 10-minute surveys for breeding birds were conducted during the breeding season , the first on June 20th and the second on July 5th. Fall 2013 surveys were conducted on August 24th, September 5th, September 21st, September 24th and October 1st. Preliminary surveys were completed during the 2012 fall migration period on the following dates: September 7th, September 19th, October 3rd and October 12th. 3.0 RESULTS 3.1 DESKTOP REVIEW A search of the IBA database revealed that the nearest IBA, Central Cape Breton Highlands (NS061) is situated approximately 12 km northwest of the Site (IBA 2013). This IBA is home to a globally significant number of Bicknell's Thrush ( Bicknell's Thrush favours dense coniferous forest, and so is unlikely to occur on the project site, which is dominated by mixed forest. Results of the 2nd MBBA were accessed to provide information on breeding birds in the general project area. Results were obtained for square 20QS01, the 10 km by 10 km atlas square in which the site is located; because the site is located near the western edge of this square, results were also obtained for the adjacent square 20PR91. A total of 88 species were recorded for the square (MBBA 2013); these are listed in Table A.1 (Appendix A). Of these species, 22 were confirmed to be breeding in one or both squares based on observed breeding evidence, an d a further 43 were considered probable breeders. Count results were obtained for all 28 CBCs conducted between 1966 and 201 2 in the Sydneys count area, a 24 km diameter circle which is centered near North Sydney and encompasses the project location (CBC 2013). Over the 28 CBCs, a total of 1 35 species have been observed wintering in the Sydneys count area (Table A.2 in Appendix A). Barrachois Pre-Construction Avian Surveys Natural Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 3 3.2 FIELD SURVEYS A list of species observed during the field surveys is provided in Table 1 and in Appendix A, and the results of all surveys conducted to date are discussed below. Representative photographs of habitats on the site are provided in Appendix B. Table 1. Species Observed during Field Surveys of the Barrachois Site.

Black-capped Chickadee, Golden-crowned Kinglet, and Hairy Woodpecker were the most commonly observed species. 3.2.2 Spring Migration Surveys Spring migration surveys were conducted on May 16th and 31st, and June 8th. A total of 156 bird observations were recorded, with 30 species detected during the spring migration surveys (Table A.4 in Appendix A). Black-throated and Hermit Thrush were the most commonly observed species at the site. Overall, species abundance and diversity was not particularly high, and all of the species observed are known to breed in the region, with no northern migrant species detected; therefore, it is unlikely that the area serves as a significant spring migration stopover. 3.2.3 Summer Breeding Surveys Breeding bird surveys were conducted on June 20th and July 5th. Over the two breeding bird surveys, breeding evidence was recorded for 28 species (Table A.5 in Appendix A), including 8 Barrachois Pre-Construction Avian Surveys Natural Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 5 probable breeders, 18 possible breeders and two confirmed breeders according to the categories used by the MBBA. One additional species, the Northern Goshawk, was confirmed to be nesting at the site during a late July visit to the site. At this time, an agitated adult bird was observed near the edge of the met tower clearing, and at least one juvenile could be heard in the forest nearby. The most commonly detected species during breeding bird surveys at the site were Black- also frequently observed. 3.2.4 Fall Migration Surveys Fall 2013 migration surveys were conducted on August 24th, September 5th, September 21st, September 24th and October 1st. A total of 42 bird observations were recorded, with 13 species detected (Table A.6 in Appendix A). Blue Jay, Black-capped Chickadee and Golden-crowned Kinglet were the most commonly observed species at the site in the fall . Just 16 individuals representing 11 species were detected during the preliminary fall migration surveys conducted in 2012 at the property edge (Table A.7 in Appendix A). Species abundance and diversity were quite low at the site, and all of the species observed are known to breed in the region, with no northern migrant species detected. Therefore, it is unlikely that the area serves as a significant migration stopover. 3.3 OBSERVED HEIGHT OF BIRDS Most of the birds observed during the surveys were detected by sound or were seen perched in vegetation on the site. For birds that were seen in flight, the approximate height at which birds were observed was recorded. Of the recorded observations of birds in flight, all but three were 20 m or lower; a pair of Great Cormorants was observed at approximately 100 m above ground surface, and Common Ravens were observed flying at 30 and 50 m above ground. 3.4 AVIAN SPECIES AT RISK AND SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN One federally and provincially listed species at risk was observed during the field surveys, the Olive-sided Flycatcher ( SARA and NSESA : Threatened). Six species considered to be of conservation concern by ACCDC were observed: Gray Jay number of additional species at risk and species of conservation concern may occur in the project area, based on information obtained from the MBBA and CBC (Appendix A). Of those, the following are considered to have potential to occur on the site based on the available habitat: Common Nighthawk ( Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 6 Pine Siskin (ACCDC: S3S4B,S5N) Certain species, including raptors and the aforementioned Wilson's Snipe, are considered to be at potentially greater risk of negative interactions with wind turbines due to aerial behavior such as hunting and mating displays (Kingsley and Whittam 2007). Because of this concern , presence of raptors is of particular interest. The following raptor species have been observed at various times of year during the field surveys: Northern Goshawk, observed during the summer breeding season. Breeding near site, as one agitated adult bird and at least one immature were observed near the edge of the met tower clearing. Red-tailed Hawk, a single individual observed during summer and fall surveys. In addition to the above species, Bald Eagle, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Broad-winged Hawk, American Kestrel and Merlin were all observed during the breeding season within approximately 10 km of the site (MBBA 2012). 3.5 OTHER FAUNA Incidental observations of non-avian fauna noted during the surveys included white-tailed arthemis ). 4.0 DISCUSSION A total of 48 species were observed during the surveys, of which 29 are confirmed or believed to be breeding on or near the project site . All of the species observed during the migration surveys are known to breed in the region; it is not evident that the area serves as a significant migration stopover. Breeding status was inferred based on observed behavior the June and July breeding bird surveys and incidental observations. Three species were confirmed to be breeding in the area based on presence of fledged young or on observations of adults carrying food, and a further 8 species are considered \"probable\" breeders based on territorial behaviour (observed in suitable habitat on two or more occasions over the breeding season), agitated behaviour of adults, and/or presence of a breeding pair in suitable habitat. Another 18 species were considered \"possible\" breeders, heard or observed only once in a particular location in suitable breeding habitat. One federally listed species at risk, the Olive-sided Flycatcher, was observed during the summer breeding surveys. Additionally, six regionally rare species according to ACCDC were observed: and Olive-sided Flycatcher. The potential negative effects of wind farms on birds can be classified into four main categories: collision, displacement due to disturbance, barrier effects and habitat loss (Drewitt and Langston 2006). Barrachois Pre-Construction Avian Surveys Natural Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 7 Collision Rate of collision with turbines can be affected by a number of factors. For example, certain species, due to size or behaviour, are at greater risk of collision with turbines (for example, large-bodied birds such as geese are less maneuverable, and species such as raptors and snipe engage in aerial hunting or displays (Kingsley and Whittam 2007; Environment Canada 2006). Nocturnal migrants (including many passerines) tend to fly well above turbine heights; however, they may be at risk of collision near stopover locations at dawn and dusk. In adverse weather conditions, poor visibility and impaired flight due to strong headwinds can increase collision risk. Turbine size, rotor speed and lighting can also influence collision risk; for example, intermittent flashing white lights of the lowest effective intensity will be less disorienting to birds than a constant bright point source (Drewitt and Langston 2006). Collision risk can be mitigated by proper siting and alignment of turbines, avoiding areas of large concentrations of sensitive species, as well as migration corridors and important nesting areas. Results of surveys to date indicate that the Barrachois site does not appear to support a large number of migrants (although fall migration surveys are ongoing). Furthermore, the site is situated more than 10 km from the nearest IBA. Displacement Due to Disturbance Displacement of birds can occur during both the construction and operations phases of wind farms, through visual, noise and vibration impacts. Displacement may also occur as a result of repeated movements of maintenance vehicles (Drewitt and Langston 2006). The pattern and scale of disturbance depends on the species, life cycle stage, availability of alternate habitats, and siting of the wind turbines with respect to important habitat areas. Little is known about the effects of displacement on breeding birds, particularly short-lived passerines, and in long-term recruitment rates of longer-lived species around wind turbines; however, for wintering waterfowl, reduced density and abundance has been reliably recorded as far as 600 m from wind turbines. It is difficult to determine the potential scale of disturbance caused by a wind farm, as effects can only reliably be determined following turbine installation through comparison of abundances before and after. Therefore, post-construction follow-up monitoring of the site will be required to assess displacement effects. Barrier Effect In addition to the habitat displacement described above, birds may also alter their migration flyways and/or local flight paths to avoid wind turbines (Drewitt and Langston 2006; Environment Canada 2006). This may lead to birds having to fly further, resulting in a negative impact on individual energy expenditure. Construction may also disrupt routes between feeding, roosting, moulting and/or breeding areas far from the wind farm. These barrier effects are more Barrachois Pre-Construction Avian Surveys Natural Forces Inc., Halifax, NS October 2013 Project No. TV121034 Page 8 pronounced with larger wind farms, or those that are sited close to other wind farms creating a cumulative barrier effect. The Barrachois project is considered a small wind farm, with three turbines proposed, and is situated approximately 10 km from the nearest wind farm site, which is anticipated to be under construction at Hillside Boularderie in late 2013. Habitat Loss Actual habitat loss resulting from wind farm construction is quite small on a per-turbine basis, generally amounting to no more than 5% of the total development area (Drewitt and Langston 2006). The proposed wind farm consists of two turbines, and the habitat types found in the project footprint are common for the area; therefore, habitat loss is not expected to have an significant impact on species in the Project Area. 5.0 REFERENCES CBC (Christmas Bird Count) 2013.

INTRODUCTION Natural Forces Wind Inc. is proposing to install a pair of wind turbines in Barrachois, Nova Scotia, and has engaged the services of AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, a Division of AMEC Americas Limited (AMEC), to provide an assessment of the potential effects of the proposed project on local and migratory bat populations. In order to provide a complete assessment, AMEC has compiled relevant informat ion on bats in the region, reviewed existing monitoring protocols, and employed a monitori ng protocol previously developed to meet the specific needs of Natural Forces Wind Inc. Finally, AMEC has collected and analyzed data on the occurrence of bats in the project area in accordance with the protocol. The location of the site is depicted in Figure 1.1. 1.1 Legislation/Regulatory Environment An environmental assessment (EA) is an assessm ent of the possible positive or negative impact that a proposed project may have on the environment, together consisting of the environmental, social and economic aspects. This is a planni ng tool that provides managers and decision makers with information on whether a proposed project may undermine sustainable development. There are two levels of environment al assessment legislation that govern the environmental assessment process. At the provincial level, the Nova Scotia Environment Act and the ensuing regulations provide the mandate to the NS Department of Environment to review and assess environmental assessment document s prior to the approval of projects that meets certain \"trigger\" conditions. Similarly, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) perform a similar function at the federal level, providing the mandates and authorities to various government departments including the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Environment Canada, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Depending upon the location of the wind farm (private land, federal or provincial crown land), the source of funding (e.g., private investment vs. federal government) and the size of the wind farm, an environmental assessment will need to be completed for review and approval by either the NS Department of Environment, or the relevant federal department or agency. One area of concern addressed in an EA is the potential effect that a project may have on local wildlife, and the habitats upon which these species depend. As a result, the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the Nova Scotia Endangered Species Act (NSESA) must be considered in the EA process. Under the terms of the Acts, no project can have or potentially have a negative effect on a species listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as endangered, threatened or of concern, under a list within the NS General Status of Wild Species as species of conservation concern.

Bats are a matter of special interest in the EA process; since little is known about most species, there is a lack of understanding of the long term effects that past developments have had upon their wellbeing. In 2012, emergence of a devastating fungal infection affecting bat populations in eastern North America (see Section 2.0) led COSEWIC to designate three bat species, all known residents of Nova Scotia, as \"Endangered\" (COSEWIC 2012). Federally, the Canadian Wildlife Service of Environment Canada is responsible for all migratory birds and for all wildlife on federally owned land. Within the Provincial government, the Wildlife Division of the Department of Natural Resources is responsible for all wildlife, other than that managed by federal government. Furthermore, several other government Departments and Agencies have an interest in wildlife resources, and while they do not have regulatory responsibility, they may provide useful and important information on bats suitable for inclusion in an EA. Examples include the Wildlife Division of the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and the Heritage Division of Nova Scotia Tourism, Culture & Heritage. Local universities and non-profit organizations such as the Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre and local naturalist groups can also provide valuable information. Since wind energy development activities have co mmenced in Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Department of Environment has regularly i ssued consistent approval conditions for environmental assessments of wind farm projects in the province, namely: a. The Proponent must develop and implement a program to monitor for birds and bats to the standards as defined by the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources (NSDNR) and Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS). Based on the results of monitoring programs, the Proponent must make necessary modifications to mitigation plans and/or wind farm operations to prevent any unacceptable environmental effects to the satisfaction of NSE, based on consultation with NSDNR and CWS. b. The Proponent must document accidental mortalities of bats and birds and submit an annual report to the Director of Wildlife, NSDNR, and CWS. The report shall be submitted in January of each operating y ear unless otherwise approved by NSE. 2.0 INTRODUCTION TO BATS Bats are one of the most abundant groups of mammals on Earth, with over 1100 known species (Tudge 2000). Members of the Order Chiroptera, bat species are divided into two main families, the Microchiroptera (insectivorous bats) and the Megachiroptera (fruit bats). They are also among the most misunderstood mammals, with general dislike and irrational fear common worldwide. Worldwide, bats play vital roles in insect control and the life cycles of fruiting plants. Despite their important ecological roles and diversity, bats in general remain poorly understood and are often unfairly reviled by the public. Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 4 The only mammals which truly fly, all bats species have wings consisting of webbing stretched between their elongated fingers. The Microchiropt era (insectivorous bats) typically have small eyes, sharp pointed teeth, and distinctly-shaped ears. This group is also unique in that it utilizes ultrasonic noise, inaudible to humans, to navig ate by echolocation. Echolocating bats produce high-pitched calls which bounce off objects in their path. The bat then uses its highly sensitive ears to detect the resulting echo, and interprets it to provide information on size, shape and direction of travel of objects in its path. Thes e calls are usually fairly species-specific, and scientists can use the characteristics of these calls to identify bat species in an area. This ability to navigate by sound results in bats being able to fly and hunt in complete darkness, and in fact most bat species are primarily nocturnal. Megabats do not echolocate, and tend to be larger. They feed mostly on fruit and are found in tropical regions. In temperate climates such as Nova Scotia, bat species deal with the inhospitable conditions of winter by either hibernating or migrating to wa rmer areas until spring. Larger, fast-flying species tend to migrate, while smaller species, which tend to be weaker fliers, usually hibernate. Some bat species may fly up to several hundred kilometers to a suitable hibernating site, known as a hibernaculum. Many species begin gathering at their chosen hibernaculum several weeks before hibernation actually begins, and many species mate at this time. The colonial hibernation behavior of many species results in a high level of vulnerability during the winter months. While bats may arouse naturally and move around within their hibernaculum (Tuttle 1991), unintentional arousals during hibernation (such as being disturbed by humans entering their hibernaculum) can cause bats to rapidly deplete their stored fat reserves, eventually leading to starvation (Thomas, 1995). A small number of visits to a winter hibernaculum of colonial species can have serious effects on the bat population utilizing that hibernaculum. Another dramatic example of this winter vulnerability is the current white-nose syndrome (WNS) situation in the American Northeast. Named for a distinctive fungal growth around the muzzles and on the wings of affected bats, WNS causes bats to wake more frequently during hibernation and deplete their fuel and/or water stores (Reeder et al., 2012, Cryan et al., 2010). First identified in a cave in New York, USA, in February 2006 (Blehert et al. 2008), WNS has since spread to five provinces (Ontario, Quebec, NS, NB, and PEI) and 21 states as of March 25, 2013. The fungus responsible has been identified as a European species, Geomyces destructans, a cold-loving fungus that grows at temperatures below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and grows on the bats when they are hibernating in caves and mines during winter (Blehert et al. 2008). The fungus appears to disrupt the normal patterns of hibernation, causing bats to arouse too frequently from torpor and starve to death. The symptoms associated with WNS include loss of body fat, unusual winter behavior (including flying outside), and death. The mortality rate from white nose syndrome in some caves has exceeded 90% (Frick et al. 2010). WNS has contributed to the deaths of over 5.5 million bats in the northeastern US (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 2012). To date, seven hibernating bat species have been confirmed with infection of Geomyces destructans in the Northeast USA, and several of these species have suffered major mortality (Frick et al., 2010). Some of these species, like the Indiana bat ( Myotis sodalis ), were already Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 5 considered endangered. The U.S Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a website documenting the current status of the WNS situation ( http://www.fws.gov/whitenosesyndrome ). All of the species known to occur in NS have re ported to exhibit white nose syndrome in other parts of their ranges. In the northeastern United States, the once common little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus ), has suffered a major population collapse and may be at risk of rapid extirpation in the Northeast within 20 years, due to mortality associated with WNS (Frick et al . 2010). Dzal et al. (2001) reported a 78 per cent decline in the summer activity of the little brown bat in an area affected by WNS, as evidenc ed by echolocation surveys. WNS has already seriously decreased populations in NB (Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) News, 2012) and NS (CBC News, 2013). The long-term impact of the reduction in bat populations may be an increase in insect populations as they become subject to decreased bat predation, possibly leading to crop damage or increased pesticide requirements. 3.0 BAT SURVEY METHODOLOGY 3.1 Review of Available Data The baseline bat monitoring survey began with a detailed desktop review of existing data. As the Nova Scotia Department of Environment (NSE) regards wind farm sites within 25 km of a known bat hibernaculum as having 'very high' site sensitivity (NSE 2009), it is imperative to determine whether the bat hibernacula are known to occur within this radius. A review of geological mapping of the area was conducted to determine the likelihood of possible bat hibernacula, in the form of natural caves. NSDNR's Abandoned Mine Openings database was also consulted to determine if there are abandoned mines in the area which could also serve as hibernacula. As many parts of Nova Scotia have historically supported various types of mining activities, a review of the geology and mining history of the site can be beneficial in determining the likely presence of natural caves and/ or abandoned mines. Bat species occurring in the general Sydney area were discussed with NSDNR's Regional Biologist for Cape Breton. Local naturalists were also consulted. 3.2 Acoustic Surveys Electronic detection of bats has advanced considerably in recent years, enabling researchers to detect and monitor bats without capturing bats with mist nets. The Anabat SD2 detector, manufactured by Titley Scientific, is a we ll known monitoring system used throughout North America to identify and survey bats by detecting and analyzing their echolocation calls (Photo 3.1). The Anabat system is a passive detection syst em that monitors bat activity without human presence and intervention. It consists of a bat detector, a ZCAIM (Zero-Crossings Analysis Interface Module) and software. The Anabat detector unit contains an ultrasonic microphone, an electronic amplifier, and a digital signal divider. The bat detector will, if desired, produce an output audible to humans from the inaudible ultrasonic echolocation signals produced by the bats. The ZCAIM is an interface that is used to read the Anabat recorded data on a computer, and the software is used to present the data in a useable format. In the Anabat SD2 system Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 6 used in the present study, the ZCAIM records data directly onto a compact flash card, which is then used to transfer data to a computer. Photo 3.1 An Anabat SD2 acoustic bat detector and compact flash card. Weller (2002) noted that there is a considerable variability in signals recorded by Anabat detectors depending upon their orientation. Based on Weller's research it was determined that multiple bat detectors should be deployed. While two detectors may record the same individuals, the redundancy will enable continued detection in the event one system fails due to battery depletion, weather events, or animal disturbance. Efforts must be made to ensure continuous detection for a complete picture of potential bat activity. Based on previous acoustic bat surveys and lite rature reviews conducted by AMEC, it was decided that an aerial detector elevated 10 m above ground surface would be set to detect bats along the tree line at the edge of the cleared site, to permit detection of bats foraging near the tree canopy at the edge of the clearing and detect bats that may be migrating above the canopy. A second ground-based system was set to detect bats that forage on low flying insects in cleared areas. Use of the dual acoustic systems with a combination of ground and aerial orientation would provide effective cross coverage and ensure redundancy in the event one system failed due to battery failure or disturbance. Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 7 3.2.1 Aerial Systems 2012 Deployment In 2012 the subject property was accessed on foot via a cleared area adjacent to a cellular tower located 600 m west of the Turbine 1 location. The southwestern edge of the property was approximately 130 m from the cellular tower access road. Because of the difficulty in accessing the property, a pole-mounted unit was not erected in 2012; instead, a high-sensitivity Anabat microphone was mounted in a waterproof cover on an extension cable and affixed to the trunk of a tree at the forest edge, approximately 2.5 m above ground level (Photo 3.2). The microphone was oriented parallel to the treeline and faced downward, with the lip of the waterproof cover angled at approximately 22.5\u00b0 from horizontal to reflect incoming sounds into the microphone. A microphone extension cable ran down the pole to the main body of the detector, which was placed in a waterproof housing at the base of the pole, along with the power supply. The waterproof housing was covered in a green bag plastic to minimize visibility and potential vandalism. Coordinates were 20 T 699754E, 5114038N (UTM NAD 83) (Figure 3.1). This system remained in operation from 7 September to 11 October 2012.

Coordinates were 20T 700455E 5114125N (UTM NAD 83). The microphone assembly pointed to the southwest, and parallel to the tree line to allow sampling of the forest edge. A high-sensitivity Anabat microphone was mounted on an extension cable and placed within a tubular waterproof plastic housing which was sealed around the cable at the base. This housing was secured to a length of 1.25 inch diameter galvanized steel pipe. The microphone faced downwards within the housing, and a plate angled at 45\u00b0 from horizontal reflected incoming sounds into the waterproof housing. This allowed sampling of a horizontal section of the sky at treetop height. The tower was constructed with a cantilevered base, allowing it to be raised and lowered as needed. A microphone extension cable ran down the pole to the main body of the detector, which was placed in a waterproof housing at the base of the pole, along with the power supply. The waterproof housing was covered in green plastic to minimize visibility and potential vandalism. This system remained in operation until Sept 6, 2013, when the tower was extended to 10 m in height and the microphone casing was raised to the top of the tower. This system was frequently checked (approximately biweekly or less) to download data, check batteries, and verify that the system was intact and functioning properly. It was left operational until Sept 30, 2013. Both detectors were programmed to record all ultrasonic sounds between 7 pm and 7 am. Each system was frequently checked (approximately bi weekly or less) to download data, refresh batteries, and verify that the system was intact and functioning properly.

Ground unit is visible at base of pole. 3.2.2 Ground Systems 2012 Deployment In 2012 an Anabat SD2 acoustic bat detector was deployed at the Barrachois site from 6 September 2012 to 11 October 2012. Coordinates were 699754E, 5114038N (UTM NAD 83) and the location is depicted on Figure 5.1 (2012 Survey Location). The detector was deployed, along with its power supply, on the ground in a waterproof housing fitted with a microphone tube, which allowed sampling of a section of the sky approximately 45 degrees from horizontal. The detector was programmed to record all ultrasonic sounds between 7 pm and 7 am. This setup was placed within 5m of the tree line on the site, with the microphone tube pointing parallel to the tree line (northeast) to allow sampling of the forest edge (Photo 3.3). The waterproof housing was covered in brush to minimize visibility and potential vandalism. 2013 Deployment In 2013 an Anabat SD2 acoustic bat detector was deployed at the Barrachois site from 29 July to Sept 30. Deployment was identical to the 2012 deployment, except that the unit was placed at the base of the aerial tower (Photo 3.3). Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 11 3.2.3 ANABAT Data Format and Analysis While deployed at the site, the ANABAT detectors recorded all ultrasonic frequencies detected onto a compact flash card. This data was then interpreted via AnalookW software (version 3.8s) using zero-crossing analysis. All ultrasonic frequencies recorded were then displayed graphically as sonograms, and bat echolocation sequences were identified based on the minimum, maximum, and characteristic frequencies, in addition to the slope of the calls (O'Farrell et al. 1999). Sequences were identified to species using the Analook W software and published information on the calls of bat species native to eastern North America (Barclay 1989, Barclay et al. 1999, Betts 1998, Broders et al. 2001, Fenton and Bell 1981, Fenton et al. 1983, MacDonald et al. 1994). It should be noted that bats of the genus Myotis present within Nova Scotia (little brown bat and northern long-ear ed bat) generally cannot be distinguished reliably using these acoustic survey methods. 4.0 SURVEY RESULTS 4.1 Review of Available Data Within 25 km of the Project site, there are almost 500 known mine openings according to the Nova Scotia Abandoned Mine Openings (AMO) Database (NSDNR, 2013). None of these mine openings correspond to caves known to support bats in Nova Scotia, as summarized by Moseley (2007a and 2007b). Total measured depths of most of the mine openings are not provided; however, two of the openings have a measured depth of ten metres or more. The original depths of some of these openings were much greater, but according to the records, the majority have been filled or sealed for public safety (NSDNR, 2013). Discussions with Dr. Hugh Broders and NSDNR Regional Biologist Terry Power indicate that there are no known bat hibernacula in the immediate area of Barrachois. According to Terry Power, there is a small hibernaculum in an abandoned mine located approximately 8 km south of the project site; in a winter 2012 survey, fewer than 20 Myotis individuals were counted. Dr. Broders states that observations of significant swarming activity suggest a possible hibernaculum near Donkin, approximately 35 km east of the project site, and there have been reports of at least two other minor hibernacula (10 - 100 bats) in Cape Breton: the one in Coxheath described above, and another near Louisbourg, more than 40 km to the southeast of the project site. 4.2 ANABAT Data 4.2.1 Aerial System The 2012 tree-mounted system, which was deployed from Sept 6 to Oct 11 2012, recorded bat activity during 17 of the 19 deployment nights. The average was 11.05 calls per night (minimum 2, maximum 57). The majority of the bat calls were Myotis species, though a few were questionable. While it is difficult to confidently assign Myotis echolocation sequences to a particular species, the calls recorded show characteristics of both M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis , and it is assumed that both species are present on the site. Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 12 The 2013 aerial system, which was deployed from July 30 to Sept 30 2013, recorded bats on 44 of the 54 nights on which the unit appeared to be functioning properly. During the period between 7 Sept and 16 Sept 2013 no data was recorded, possibly due to an unexpected compact flash card formatting error, however for four days prior to and after this event, the units each set up folders to record data (indicating they were functioning properly, but did not record any data). Figure 4.1 and Table 4.2.1 depict the number of bat echolocation sequences recorded by the aerial Anabat unit at Barrachois in 2013, as well as the temperature and precipitation data for the Sydney Airport (the closest weather station with sufficient data). All units recorded a significant number of bat calls. All appear to belong to Myotis species. The aerial system in particular recorded a maximum of 828 bat echolocation calls on one night, Aug 8 2013. It is of note that the majority of the aerial data recorded at Barrachois in 2013 is very \"clean\", i.e., there are virtually no noise files recorded. In addition, the vast majority of the aerial files appear to be simple echolocation calls, with no evidence of \"feeding buzzes\", indicating that bats recorded by the aerial system are not feeding. The specific nature and reasons for this event are subject to various interpretations: migration, movement from local hibernaculum due to disturbance, etc. However, the reasons for the increased numbers does not diminish the important observation that the bats have been detected in the area.

ND= No Data 4.2.2 Ground System The 2012 ground system, which was deployed from Sept 6 to Oct 11 2012, recorded bat activity during 20 of the 36 deployment nights. The average was 13.35 calls per night (minimum 1, maximum 62). The majority of the bat calls appear to Myotis species. While it is difficult to confidently assign Myotis echolocation sequences to a particular species, the calls recorded show characteristics of both species, and it is assumed that both species are present on the site. The 2013 ground system, which was deployed from July 29 to Sept 30 2013, recorded bats on 44 of the 46 nights on which the detector was functioning properly. (An unexpected compact flash card formatting issue led to the units not recording data from 7 Sept to 16 Sept 2013). The data recorded by the ground system shows a very high percentage of feeding buzzes, indicating the bats are foraging in the area, but apparently below 10 m height. Figure 4.1 and Table 4.2.2 depict the number of bat echolocation sequences recorded by the ground-based Anabat unit at Barrachois in 2013, as well as the temperature and precipitation data for the Sydney Airport (the closest weather station with sufficient data).

ND= No Data 5.0 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS While it is difficult to confidently assign Myotis echolocation sequences to a particular species, the calls recorded by both the aerial and ground units in both 2012 and 2103 show characteristics of both M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis , and it is therefore assumed that both species are present on the site. The decrease in bat echolocation sequences as the fall season progresses in both 2012 and 2013 matches the seasonal behaviour of Myotis species in NS. Occasional nights earlier in the season during which few bat calls were recorded may be due to inclement weather conditions, such as heavy rain, discouraging foraging by bats. This is likely the case for the night of 9 Sept 2012, during which the units recorded numerous noise files but only a single recognizable bat sequence, while there were high numbers of bat calls recorded on the previous and subsequent nights. The resurgence in bat activity on Sept 21 and 22 2013 appears to correspond to a rise in nighttime temperatures after two cold (maxim um 2\u00baC) nights), suggesting that bats were perhaps making up for lost foraging and/or transit time. It is also possible that the resurgence in bat activity levels from Sept 20-23 could be due to different Myotis species behaviours or behaviours of populations from different hibernacula. Overall, the review of the data from the monitoring program in 2012 and 2013 suggests a significant level of bat activity on the Barrachois site. Based on the high levels of bat activity detected by the aerial system (828 sequences in one night), it appears there may be significant numbers of bats present in or transiting through this area on a seasonal basis. Further research, Barrachois Wind Turbine Acoustic Bat Monitoring Survey Report October 2013 Project No.: TV134005.100 Page 20 outside the scope of this program, is required to determine the reason for the significant bat presence in this area. As this site is approximately 8 km from a known small Myotis hibernaculum, resulting in Barrachois having 'very high' site sensitivity according to NSE (2009), further research is highly recommended.

Project Background Natural Forces Wind Inc. is proposing to develop a two turbine wind farm in Barrachois, Nova Scotia, and has engaged the services of AMEC Environment & Infrastructure, a Division of AMEC Americas Limited (AMEC), to conduct a Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge study of the Project Site. 1.2. Indigenous Knowledge and Knowledge Systems Early in the 1990 's governments and international development agencies became aware that Traditional Ecological Knowledge and associated Traditional Management Systems could be useful in improving development planning in areas populated by indigenous peoples (Johannes 1993). Traditional Ecological Knowledge, or as it is now more commonly known as, Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK), is the accumulated knowledge of natural ecosystems, based on spiritual health, culture and language of the people that is passed between successive generations through stories, song and dance and myths to ensure their survival and the integrity of their socio-cultural and socio-economic systems. Indigenous knowledge is dynamic, based upon an intimate understanding of the components of non-living (abiotic) and living (biotic) environments. In most instances the management systems aspects of indigenous peoples knowledge systems has been segregated from the endeavour of compiling information for decision-making and the ITK aspects have been the focus of study. In Nova Scotia, ITK is referred to as Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge (MEK). SCALE: AMEC Environment and Infrastructure Japan, METI, Esri China (Hong Kong), and the General Site Location Path: P:\\5300 PROJECTS\\2013\\TV134005 - Date: 1030 Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada B3J 3L11 0 1 2 0.5 KilometersMEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 3 Indigenous Traditional Knowledge has become the focus of considerable international discourse on intellectual property rights (Ritchie et al. 1996). Indigenous communities worldwide have felt that their knowledge has been used to advance commercialization and over exploitation of local renewable resources and as a result, have become vocal about the protection of their knowledge and its use. The value of indigenous knowledge is becoming increasingly recognized by scientists, managers, and policy makers and is an evolving subject of both domestic and international law (Anaya 1996). Indigenous people are aware that there is a value to their knowledge and that it can be used for exploitative purposes. In some cases this risk has been offset by the fact knowledge holders often provided access to their knowledge and knowledge systems for a cost (fee), however, it is freely and openly shared, subject to intellectual property rights agreements, when it is used for protection of biodiversity and environmental condition. Acquisition of knowledge on complex ecological systems is an ongoing and dynamic learning process. As such, indigenous knowledge often provides an informational foundation for, and is used by indigenous people's institutions and organizations. Indigenous knowledge is seen to be a c omponent of the cultural elements of a society, and the processes of acquiring knowledge involve institutional frameworks and social networks nested across social and geographic scales (Folke 2004). This requires multiple tools for data and information gathering and multiple approaches to information analysis. Recent ITK studies have focused on the collection of information from elderly members of indigenous communities. In some instances, depending on the purpose of the study, present day hunters/trappers/fishers are interviewed to collect information on the specific location of plants and animals considered important as biologically important to the local ecosystem. This approach is a science-based research approach for data acquisition, and neglects some of the social, economic, cultural and spiritual elements. It is now widely understood that Traditional Knowledge is greater than the sum of individual experiences, and that traditional knowledge is a significant component of the culture and identity of indigenous peoples (Orcherton 2012). Traditional Knowledge is founded in the collective experiences of a community and is transmitted between individuals and generation in accordance with traditional institutions and practices. It is also understood that a society's culture can evolve as a result changing resource abundance, environmental condition, technological changes and interaction with other cultural groups. Studies that focus on individual's harvesting experience are founded upon a false assum ption that individual resources users can provide a meaningful understanding of the relationship between a \"People\" and a \"Place\". Evidence suggests that this is an incomplete approach and that the gathered information will not enhance understanding of the relationship between the Indigenous community and the traditional territory, and does not resolve the issues regarding acceptability of new project development on local indigenous populations. To this end, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has hosted several workshops that have examined the process of indigenous input on project development (Mauro and Hardison 2000, Persoon and Minter 2011). Results of these efforts MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 4 have substantiated the use of historical and archival research, information gathering through group workshops and discussions with political/traditional leadership. In Nova Scotia MEK Studies have predominantly dealt with the collection of historical data from archival sources and data on the historical (living memory) and current use of resources. The focus of the knowledge studies has been the geographical region in or near the site of a proposed project. While this process is an effective means to meet the letter of the Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study (MEKS) protocol which has been adopted by the Assembly of NS Chiefs, it does not meet the intent of the protocol in areas where there may be limited activity or recoverable information on historical activity in a particular area. The principle of the MEKS is to unde rstand the relationship between the Mi'kmaq and the region in which a new project is intended. 2.0 Barrachois MEKS Methodology The methodology for the MEK study for the Barrachois site consisted of two main exercises. A desktop review of existing data was performed to gather information specific to the site, while consultations with local First Nations groups and individuals enabled the collection of local site-specific knowledge of historical and current Mi'kmaq use of natural resources in the area. Field surveys then confirmed and updated the available knowledge. Each of these exercises is described in further detail in the following subsections. 2.1 Gathering of Local Knowledge of Project Site 2.1.1 Review of Available Data A noted deficiency in many ecological knowledge surveys has been the absence of any effort to determine the validity of information collected. An informant who is knowledgeable about historical activity or environmental matters is just as concerned about the accuracy of information as any researcher. However, there can be a temptation to embellish the facts to influence the outcome of any development initiative so that the final decisions favour the informant's community ( Johannes 1993). Furthermore, since many ecological knowledge studies require payment of an honorarium or fees to the informant, some informants may feel obligated to enhance information to justify earnings for information. Finally, some individuals (who have been referred to as \"glory seekers\") may wish to gain recognition from outside communities by providing embellished information to researchers from outside the indigenous community (Poulette, Personal Communication, Marshall, Personal Communication). Informants may not intend to compromise the reliability of information compiled in an indigenous knowledge study, but nonetheless, create a need to verify information collected through ground-truthing. In many regions, indigenous organizations and researchers alike have adopted a process for traditional ecological knowledge data collection that moves away from individual informant interview and brings small groups of community members together in a workshop format. This system enables researchers an opportunity to observe and collect information from a variety of sources (such as youth, elders, women, hunters, community leaders, etc.) during focus group sessions (Persoon and Minter 2011). This process provides a number of benefits: MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 5 Group dynamic provides an opportunity to dampen embellishment of information Groups can provide multiple perspectives on past community experience and stories passed down in the community Conversation amongst members of the group can trigger old memories Groups can provide greater understanding on the \"systems\" used in the community to pass information between community members and between generations Groups can provide insight into resource management decision-making processes in the community. Group sessions are more cost and time effective means to conduct surveys. This workshop format has been widely adopted for ongoing indigenous knowledge studies. The process is used in northern indigenous knowledge study initiatives, such as the Inuit Qaujimajatuquangit (Inuit traditional knowledge) studies being underta ken by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association . Workshop formats for indigenous knowledge research has been recently promoted in UN workshops on Indigenous Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, and has been discussed with KMKNO consultants involved with the review of the MEKS Protocol (Francis, Personal Communication). The approach adapted to the MEKS involving engagement of Mi'kmaq knowledge holders at a community level was through workshops that built upon active social engagement strategies. The focus of this process was the Eskasoni Council. This was due to a number of conditions specific to the project and the community: Engagement activities with First Nations should be vetted by the Band Council as a matter of protocol and respect; For a relatively small community the Band Council can be an effective representation of a cross section of the community interests; The specific project is of general concern to some members of the Band; 2.1.2 Interviews and Meetings with Local Residents AMEC conducted roundtable discussions in Membertou October 25, November 28 and 29th and March 20th. Meetings were held in Eskasoni on October 24th and April 8th. Follow-up telephone conversations with some participants were undertaken in August, 2013 to verify notes. Invitations were sent to key informants selected by the local organizers (Band contact). AMEC provided an introduction to the meeting explaining that the purpose of the roundtable session was to discuss Mi'kmaq knowledge and interest (current and historical use) of the project area. It was specifically noted that the MEKS is about the location , and not about the project proposed for the site. Maps of the project site and surrounding area were laid out on tables to provide participants with the location and context. All workshops included a meal so that participants could share a meal while discussions about the study area took place. The shared meal facilitated open relaxed discussion. Participants were not paid an honorarium, since the payment of fees for interviews could be considered as a form of coercion under the principles of free, prior and informed consent, as described by the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 6 The Meetings had limited attendance, in part due to the lack of local concern for the project, and other ongoing, previously unscheduled community events. As a result, AMEC provided opportunity for broader community participation by arranging additional roundtable sessions. Each session was conducted in the same manner. 2.2 Field Survey for General Habitats and Plant Species with Mi'kmaq Cultural Significance 2.2.1 Review of Available Data The Natural History of Nova Scotia was consulted to provide some background as to the vegetation communities typical of the region encompassing the Hillside- Boularderie Project Site. 2.2.2 Field Survey A site visit was undertaken to identify and locate potential medicinal plants and other related resources that may be of importance today. Vegetation s urveys were conducted on October 12th, 2012 by AMEC Biologist, Scott Burley and Mi'kmaq Specialist, Norma Brown within the Barrachois Wind Turbine Study Area depicted in Figure 3. Prior to conducting field surveys, the various habitats located within the Study Area were assessed and classified using information gathered during a desktop study (e.g. aerial photography and Nova Scotia Forest inventory database, etc.). Habitat modeling was conducted to identify the potential presence of plant species of sign ificance to Mi'kmaq based on available habitat. Vegetation surveys focused on plant species identified during the desk top review and consisted of optically controlled meanders through habitat polygons identified to potentially contain plants of significance to Mi'kmaq. General locations of significant plants identified in the field were recorded using a GPS and photographs of the habitats were recorded with a digital camera 2.3 Wildlife Habitat Modeling Exercise While surveys specifically targeting wildlife species were beyond the scope of this study, a review of the historical use of wildlife and fish resources by Mi'kmaq, combined with known wildlife habitat preferences and the results of the habitat surveys, allowed a determination of wildlife species potentially using the project site. The results of the desktop reviews, field surveys and the public consultation exercises were compiled and a habitat modeling exercise conducted. This exercise consisted to comparing habitat preferences of NS wildlife species with the habitats known to occur on the site, in order to determine the likelihood of each species' presence on the Barrachois Site. MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 7 3.0 Project Site Background 3.1 Environmental Context The Barrachois site lies within the Sydney Coalfields subregion of the Carboniferous Lowlands region of Nova Scotia (Davis and Browne 1996). Terrestrial habitats in this region are by coniferous forests. The topography in this Unit is fairly level. Soils are thin and well-drained throughout much of this region. The bedrock closely approaches the surface and can often be observed as slabby sandstone outcrops. Imperfectl y drained silt clay loams occur nearby (across the Little Bras d'Or bay) on Boularderie Island, and some gypsum is present. There is a range of coastal and marine habitats, such as rocky shores, sandy beaches, dune systems, mud flats, salt marshes, and islands, which in turn provide breeding and feeding areas for a range of resident and migratory birds. The marine habitats provide habitat for a wide variety of marine fauna. Human occupation has also led to extensive clear-cutting for forestry and for transmission-line development. 3.2 Historical Context 3.2.1 Traditional Land Use The Mi'kmaq1 are the pre-contact inhabitants of the region comprised of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the Gaspe region of Quebec, northern Maine and southern Newfoundland. While there are a wide range of estimates of the Mi'kmaq population before initial arrival of Europeans in North America, it is likely that the population at the time of contact was roughly 35,000 (Miller 1976). The Mi'kmaw territory was divided into seven traditional \"districts\". Each district had its own independent government and boundaries. The independent governments had a district chief (Keptinaq or Saqmaw) and a council. The council members were band (family groupings or \"clans\") chiefs, elders, and other worthy community leaders. The district council was charged with performing all the duties of any independent and free government by enacting laws, justice, apportioning fishing and hunting grounds, making war, suing for peace, etc. The seven Mi'kmaq : ) is the self -recognized term for the M\u00edkmaq of New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Maine, which translated or \"the people\". Traditional Mi'kmaq Districts (from http://www.danielnpaul.com/Map -Mi'kmaqTerritory.html) In addition to the district councils, there was also a Grand Council or Sant\u00e9 Mawi\u00f3mi. The Grand Council was composed of \"keptinaq \". There were also Elders, the Put\u00fas (Wampum belt readers and historians, who also dealt with the treaties with the non-natives and other Native tribes), the women council, and the Grand Chief (kji'saqmaw). The Grand Chief was a title given to one of the district chiefs. The local Mi'kmaq communities seasonally moved throughout the region to occupy areas of abundant food and shelter. Much of this travel was along waterways which facilitated transportation and food harvesting. It is therefore likely that the coastal rivers and streams were used during coastal travel as they provided opportunity for harvesting and for inland excursion in search of suitable encampments. Ancient First Nations people using this area would have lived a migratory life, travelling throughout the Unama'kik district, as noted above. This migratory cycle involved seasonal movement between areas where shelter and food resources wer e most abundant. While it is difficult to fully comprehend the undisturbed forests and riverine habitats that existed before colonial influences, it is possible to understand the relationship between landscape and human use activities. Barrachois site falls within the Unama'kik district which in English means \"the Land of Fog\". The District is today home to the Mi'kmaq communities of Eskasoni, Potlotek, Waycobah, Wagmatcook and Membertou. Eskasoni is the largest Mi'kmaq community, and is approximately 37 km from the proposed wind farm. Many of residents of Eskasoni were relocated from the territory and placed in the community as part of Canada's \"centralization\" policies for First Nation members . Wagmatcook , Waycobah and Membertou are also in the same district as the proposed Barrachois project site. There are other Reserves, such as Malagawatch Island on the lake, with no permanent residency but which are used for traditional seasonal hunting and fishing. MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 9 Both archaeology and oral history add to the knowledge of how these ancestors lived in pre-contact times. Dates a nd time periods were not important to the Mi'kmaq in understanding their hi story, and many hold the belief that they have occupied the region since it was possible to sustain life. Historically, Mi'kmaq stories, which were passed down through generations from one storyteller to another, describe how the earth came into being and how the animals and the People came to inhabit the region (Lockerby 2004). Mi'kmaq way of life changed after contact with the French, the first European settlers to this area. Colonial conflicts between France and England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries shaped the cultural development of the indigenous population ( Thorp 1996 ), and eventual permanent European settlement would further challenge the survival of Mi'kma q culture and Mi'kmaq as a people. On June 24 1610, Grand Chief Membertou (who was from Kespukwitk) converted to Catholicism and was baptized. This relationship with the Europeans changed with the conclusion of European wars and the transfer of Acadia to British control through Treaty. The first treaty of a series of treaties (referred to as the Covenant Chain of Treaties) between the British Crown and the Micmac Nation was signed in 1725. All were treaties were reaffirmed in 1752, and culminated in the Treaty and Royal Proclamation of 1763. The treaties were an exchange of Micmac loyalty for a guarantee that \"Micmacs\" would be able to continue hunting and fishing in their territory. These treaties have been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada as legal and binding Even after the adoption of western religious beliefs, the Mi'kmaq continued to harvest food and resources in accordance with long held spiritual understanding of the relationship between living things referred to as \"Netukulimk\". While some have argued that the eventual dominance of British colonial rule eroded traditional Mi'kmaq worldviews, there is strong evidence that Mi'kmaq harvests are still governed by Netukulimk principles (Prosper et al. 2011). 3.2.2 Traditional Food Resources Historically, the Mi'kmaq occupying the traditional district of Unama'kik annually migrated between hunting and fishing grounds throughout the district (Chute 1999). These seasonal migrations were heavily dependent upon riverine and coastal transportation. As a result, food resources were heavily biased toward fish and seafood. In late winter, the Mi'kmaw in Nova Scotia generally moved closer to the marine coast and the river mouths. Such positions allowed them to take advantage of the numerous shallow water coastal fish and shellfish exposed by the melting ice (such as winter flounder and clams) as well as the spring fish run in the rivers. In early spring, smelts and alewife were abundant in the rivers, followed by salmon and sturgeon. Brook trout and striped bass began swimming upstream, followed by white perch and \"elvers\" or young eels . American plaice appeared off the coast, as did cod, various skate species, whitling or silver hake, and mackerel. Freshwater and marine fish and shellfish species historically utilized by Mi'kmaq in N ova Scotia are listed in Table 3-1 . Table 3-1.

See discussion in text. 6 Habitat reference for fishes are from Scott and Scott (1988), while marine invertebrate references are from Peterson and Gosn er (1999). In later spring and summer, as the ice retreated and the water warmed, Mi'kmaq in coastal NS could also harvest whelks, scallops , quahogs or hard American lobster , and \"northern crab (Note that it is unclear which species are intended when Hoffman refers to 'Common Squid' and 'Northern Crab', as these are not accepted common names of any species in Nova Scotia today. The squid is presumably the Northern Shortfin Squid ( Illex illecebrosus ), while the crab may be Jonah or Rock Crab ( Cancer borealis or C. irroratus ), or Snow \" Mi'kmaq residing around the Bras d'Or Lakes and southern shore of Gulf of St. Lawrence could also harvest oysters, a species which, in the Maritimes, occurs only in these relatively warm waters (Peterson and Gosner 1999). In addition to this abundance of fish, spring was also a time when migratory birds returned and began nesting, providing plenty of fresh meat and eggs. Hoffman (1955) provided a list of bird species traditionally harvested by Mi'kmaw in Nova Scotia ( Table 3-2 ). Table 3-2.

(True bustards are large Old World game birds). A more recent report by Benoit (2007) summarized waterfowl species recently hunted by Mi'kmaq in mainland NS. While the Benoit report does not provide data on waterfowl species hunted on Cape Breton Island, it is likely that a similar suite of species are targeted by First Nation hunters on Cape Breton Island, as the species assemblage present on the Island there does not differ significantly from that occurring in mainland Nova Scotia. Species mentioned by Benoit (2007) are listed in Table 3-3 and are presumably all species traditionally hunted by Mi'kmaq people. Most of these species utilize both freshwater and marine habitats throughout the year, while others, such as eider and scoter species occur primarily in marine coastal areas. Snipe and pin-tailed ducks occur primarily in freshwater environments, while woodcock are found in forested areas, often treed wetlands. All of these species, with the exception of the Barrow's Goldeneye, are relatively common in suitable habitats throughout NS during the appropriate season. Barrow's Goldeneye in NS belongs to the eastern population, which is currently listed as SARA special concern and are quite rare in NS. It is unlikely to occur in the vicinity of the Barrachois site.

Other, non-waterfowl species are hunted in NS by First Nations hunters. Grouse (both Ruffed and Spruce) have traditionally been targeted species, and are presumably still hunted by First Nations hunters in the areas encompassing the Project Site. Ring-necked pheasant, an introduced species which now occurs through most if not all of NS, may also currently be targeted by First Nation hunters. Other bird species not typically hunted today may have been used as a traditional food source, especially in lean times. MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 15 In addition to fish, invertebrate, and bird species, the marine coast in summer also provided the Mi'kmaq with various marine mammal species which provided meat, oil, and hides. Throughout Nova Scotia, Mi'kmaq people harvested dolphins, belugas Table 3-4 Table 3-4 .

As the growing season progressed, wild fruits and other edible plant parts became available. Many foods were eaten fresh, while others which were more plentiful, such as blueberries, were dried and preserved for the leaner winter months. Edible wild plants traditionally consumed by Mi'kmaq people in Nova Scotia are listed in Table 3-5 . In the late summer and fall, the southward migrations brought many more bird species to Nova Scotia which could be harvested ( Table 3-2 ). Around the middle of September, Mi'kmaq withdrew from the coast, moving inland where they began to harvest the eels now migrating downstream. In October and MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 16 November , they began hunting moose and beavers, as well as bear, otter, muskrat, and caribou ( Table 3-4). They fished the salmon which were now returning downstream after spawning. In December, they fished tomcod, which spawn under the ice at that time. In January, seals were hunted as they came ashore on certain islands or areas of the coast to give birth. In February and March, the hunt for beavers, otters, moose, bears, and caribou continued. As the winter waned, the people moved closer to the coast again and the annual cycle was renewed . Table 3-5. Native Plant Species Traditionally Consumed by Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq .

The species present in this region is actually A. americana . 3.2.3 Traditional Medicines A use of traditional lands that continues throughout Canada, and in particular, Mi'kmaq territory, is the collection and harvest of medicinal plants. Often overlooked in these times of over-the-counter medicines, Aboriginal peoples had developed an in-depth and intimate knowledge of various local plants and how they could be used for sustenance and, in some instances, to cure ailments. This knowledge, which formed part of the spiritual understanding of the balance between people and the local environment, continues to be informally passed on from generation to generation in aboriginal communities, often as guarded family secrets that provide position within the community. It is estimated that 70-80% of people worldwide rely on traditional herbal medicines to meet their primary health care needs (WHO 2002, Farnsworth 1991). In Canada, traditional medicines still provide an increasingly important source of income for rural and aboriginal communities (Uprety, 2012). Many Mi'kmaq elders continue to harvest and prepare traditional medicines and provide them to friends and relatives to treat common health conditions (Prosper, personal communication), however, it has been noted that harvesting areas are becoming increasing limited due to continuous development that alters the natural ecosystem (Meuse, Personal Communication). Due in part to the long history of territorial occupa tion by immigrant populations, the Mi'kmaq are one of the most studied people for the use and nature of their traditional medicines (Speck 1917, Wallis and Wallis 1955), and several guide books have been published on the subject. 21 Table 3-6.

Animal, bird and fish skins were tanned using animal materials or smoked, and then used to make clothing, footwear, and baby blankets. Pelts were used to make fur robes. Sinew from animal carcasses served as thread (Nova Scotia Museum factsheet, ND). A variety of wood types were used in shelter construction. Spruce poles, birch bark sheets, and flexible moosewood (striped maple) saplings were used in the construction of conical dwellings known as \"wikuom\" or wigwams . Various woods were also used in the construction of devices to aid in transportation, and to create fish traps and weirs (NS Museum factsheet, ND). Other woods were used to make storage containers and vessels. Tools such as axes, adzes and gouges were made from reworking suitable stone and wood materials. Stones such as chalcedony were used to make hunting, cooking, carving, and hide -preparing tools, Spears were made of bone and wood, while bone was also used to make needles, awls and p ainting tools. Copper, which was likely traded for from natives from outside the region, was used to make fish hooks and needles. Teeth from beavers were used for fine carving, while walrus tusks were used for ivory. Bags and mats were made from woven ree ds, grasses, cattails, cedar, and basswood bark. Baskets may have been woven from thin branches ( Nova Scotia Museum factsheet, ND). Species -specific uses of many plant species are outlined in Table 3-7 . Dwellings and clothing were often decoratively painted using red and yellow ochre, charcoal, and ground eggshell, mixed with fish roe or egg yolks as a binder. Clothing was also decorated with animal bones, teeth, and claws and quills, and sometimes feathers. Bird wings were sometime worn by men. Pipes were made from stone, bone, bark, wood, and lobster claws. After 1600, Mi'kmaq women made decorative porcupine quillwork and shell beadwor k for sale to Europeans. Dyes for quills and mats came from a variety of roots, bark, leaves, and flowers ( Nova Scotia Museum factsheet, ND ). 31 Table 3-7.

It was noted that research is still ongoing and as a result, information is not available for public release through an MEKS at this time. The research project is still ongoing and it is likely that a considerable effort will need to be made to collect information on all areas of the province. AMEC was informed that the rich history associated with Mi'kmaq place names strongly indicate that there was a Mi'kmaq presence throughout the province. Researchers also indicated that all place name data resulting from the research will be made available to the general public via a web site in the near future (Sable, Personal communication). 4.1.2 Results of Interviews and Meetings with Local Community Members Sessions in Eskasoni and Membertou were consistent in findings for all informants. Respondents were familiar with the area, but participants at the roundtable were not aware of any direct interaction with the area in many years. The most commonly cited reasons were: The area was used by non-aboriginal population so people would not feel comfortable hunting in the area Better hunting areas in the Highlands (moose is a priority target for hunting) Too close to Sydney for good hunting Fewer hunters today compared to years ago (it was noted that only 60 persons were over the age of 65 in the community). One respondent indicated that elders would use the area for picnicking in the past but was unable to assign any specific details as to the location. It was known that one elder had considerable experience in trapping fur-bearing animals in the general vicinity. The participants in the Membertou discussions were also familiar with some activities in the project area. They indicated to following uses in the area on or near the Barrachois wind farm site: The water's edge has been used by Band members for swimming (possibly the same location implied by Eskasoni residents as to picnicking areas). Gathering (fruit). Deer hunting along Leitches Creek (near Barrachois) Fishing in Roach lake (in the general area of the project site) Salmon and smelt fishing in Balls Creek (<15 km from the project site) Lobster fishing in the Bras d'Or Lake in the waters near the property. It was stated by one Band member that while people do not extensively hunt in this area because better hunting in the highlands and in areas closer to the reserve, it is possible that people may want to hunt in MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 34 the area in the future as game abundance changes in existing hunting areas frequented by Band members. 4.2 Results of General Habitat and Culturally Significant Plant Species Survey 4.2.1 Field Survey Results During the plant surveys, a total of five dominant habitat types were. The major habitat types occurring within the Study Area include: Mixed Forest; Coniferous Forest; Riparian (Stream); Clear cut; and Shrub Swamp. The following provides a summary of the various habitats encountered during the survey. Mixed Forest Mixed Forest was found to cover the majority of the Study Area. This habitat type contained a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees in the canopy including Red Maple, Yellow Birch, Balsam Fir, along with the occasional White Pine and Hemlock. Ground cover in this habitat was found to be dominated with Feather Moss and Goldthread. Photo 4-1. Mixed Forest Coniferous Forest Patches of coniferous forest were also encountered within the Study Area. These areas consisted primarily of Balsam Fir and spruce trees in the canopy with Wild Sarsaparilla and Gold Thread present in MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 35 the ground layer. The understorey in these areas is relatively sparse with ground cover consisting primarily of Feathermoss. Photo 4-2. Coniferous Forest Shrub Swamp An alder dominated shrub swamp was noted in the Study Area near one of the proposed turbine locations. This area follows a portion of the unnamed stream that runs through the Study Area. Vegetation in this area is dominated by Alder, Labrador Tea and Mountain Holly. Sphagnum moss dominates the ground layer. Photo 4-3. Shrub Swamp Riparian (River and Lake) MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 36 A small stream was noted within the Study Area. Bank flow width of the stream was estimated to range from approximately 0.5 to 1 meter with a depth of approximately 10-15 cm. Substrate within the stream is rock with organics. Vegetation along the stream banks was very similar to the surrounding forest which consisted of Yellow Birch, Red Maple, White Birch and Balsam Fir. Photo 4-4. Riparian/Stream Habitat Clear Cut A large section of the Study Area consists of a clear cut where recent logging activities have left large sections of land in an early regenerating stage. Vegetation in this area is dominated by Raspberry, Black Berry, Alder, Balsam Fir, Pin Cherry, and Birch. Photo 4-5. Clear Cut 37 Culturally Significant Plant species A total of 24 plant species of edible, medical, or other significance to the Mi'kmaq were recorded during the 2012 survey of the Study Area. An additional two species considered useful for other purposes were also recorded. Table 4-1 provides a list of all 24 culturally significant plant species encountered in the Study Area, along with their tradition use category and the habitat in which they were recorded on the Barrachois site. See Table 3-5 , Table 3-6 , and Table 3-7 for habitat preferences of these plant species.

Other species could not be identified to species level at this time of year. 4.3 Results of Wildlife Habitat Modeling Exercise A review of the historical use of wildlife and fish resources by Mi'kmaq, combined with known wildlife habitat preferences and the results of the habitat surveys, allowed a determination of wildlife species potentially using the project site. These are outlined in Table 4-2 . Table 4-2 : Traditional Mi'kmaq Wildlife Resources Potentially Utilizing the Barrachois Site.

Note that as the site does not support any freshwater or marine habitat (aside from a very small stream which does not appear to provide fish habitat), there is no habitat for edible marine or coastal fish, mammal, invertebrate or bird species which rely on these habitats. 5.0 Conclusion The purpose of the Barrachois Mi'kmaq ecological study was to identify the interests of Mi'kmaq communities on the lands and resources in and near the proposed project. This study was conducted, in part, in conjunction with a previous study for the proposed Hillside-Boularderie Wind Farm as there is likely a shared interest in most sites in the general area due to their close proximity to present day Mi'kmaq communities. The interests in the Barrachois site include local and traditional knowledge of the places potentially affected by a project. Information on current use of the area, combined with historical research on Mi'kmaq presence in the area, and knowledge of the impacts of government policies and programs on Mi'kmaq land use can provide a modest understanding of the interests of the Mi'kmaq on a particular place and project. The MEKS does not constitute consultation and the information is collected without prejudice to the rights and interests of the Mi'kmaq nation This MEKS demonstrates that there has been a long-standing relationship with, and a considerable attachment to the region in and around Barrachois, Nova Scotia. This region is the source of MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 40 considerable cultural significance and the source of pride for many residents of Eskasoni. Mi'kmaq have historically used the region for hunting, and some small game trapping still occurs in the general area. Ancestors of the present residents had demonstrated local hunting, trapping and gathering practices to newcomers, thus fostering a lasting relationship of peace and friendship with the French and eventually other European inhabitants of the area. This intimate relationship with the region is demonstrated with the extensive awareness of flora and fauna resources in the project area despite the interruption in use of the area due to development and Government of Canada aboriginal policies . The existence of multiple culturally important plants in the study area suggests that the general project area was likely used by the ancest ors of local Mi'kmaq. While it was noted that there was limited involvement of Band members in the project site, it was clearly evident that the area had been used in the past (within living memory) for trapping, food gathering and recreation. The decision to continue to use this area has been affected by a number of socio-political factors (most significantly centralization policies to move Mi'kmaq families to reserves ) and demographic factors. In particular, a rapidly growing youth population that is pursuing education and alternative training has resulted in a general move away from hunting within the rapidly growing communities (it is likely that firearms legislation and hunter training requirements may be a factor in the decline in hunting amongst Mi'kmaq youth ). This has been mirrored by a change in diet and change in general health condition in First Nation communities. It is also clear from the research that, traditionally, decisions related to hunting and fishing has been based on opportunistic access to food resources that are most abundant. As a result, there may be future interest in fishing, hunting and gathering in the project area as land-use changes, urbanization and other developments impact areas currently used by Mi'kmaq hunters and fishers. In keeping with traditional decision-making practices, an important attribute of the ecological knowledge system, areas such as the project site would logically be considered for harvesting activities due to the close proximity to the reserves. In keeping with the principles and statements of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, future planning and development of the Barra chois Wind Farm should involve the application of Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge. Natural Forces Wind Inc. should, as a result, maintain communication with the local Mi'kmaq communities. MEKS Barrachois Wind Farm 2013 41 6.0 Literature Cited Adney, E. T. (1944).
