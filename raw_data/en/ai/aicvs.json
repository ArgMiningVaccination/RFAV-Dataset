It would be best if you pursued holistic therapy under the supervision of qualified health care professional. History of holistic therapy The term 'holistic' is associated with health care since 2500 years ago, from Hippocrates. Hippocrates believed that focusing on one aspect of the human body is insufficient rather, to establish the equilibrium among individuals, the working of different body parts should be observed. In the 20th century, health care updated and became more focused on the extraction of intervention through certain symptoms. The mental issues were addressed with counseling or talk therapy, while physical problems were treated with medicines and surgeries. The body and mind were still considered separate entities. Before the 1970s, health care professionals believed that addressing a few symptoms can treat certain problems and didn't helped to improve the overall quality of life. Later in 1975, the movement in support of complementary health therapies got momentum. Holistic treatment program Generally, rehab programs that include holistic therapies involve the integration of mental, physical, and spirituality make up a comprehensive treatment option for drug abuse. According to a survey, from every 10 adults in the US, 4 use different forms of complementary and alternative therapy, and the trend is increasing with every passing day. Many people have found that traditional therapies have failed to offer them a cue. They hope that their general physician will completely understand the complexity of their disease, delve into the source of the problem, and design the treatment that focuses on the entire body. For instance, a person with chronic pain may visit a holistic therapist to dig deeper into the associated psychological issues of their ailment. Stress and anxiety might cause chronic pain, and the stress is post-traumatic, then coping it up might give rise to chronic pain.

However, human beings especially promote this process of self-realization through different ways such as meditation, yoga, self-reflection, etc. Roberto Assagioli was the first who coined the term psychosynthesis in 1911. He made efforts to shortcomings in the theories on the human psyche by Sigmund Freud. Psychosynthesis is the amalgam of both eastern and western health-related theories. Eastern psychology focuses on spiritual healing, while western psychology gives priority to neurobiology and personality. The main focus of psychosynthesis is to combine all the theories and ensure the patient receives the maximum healing, self-love, and full potential. Many professionals believe that the entire human body controls its feelings. The mental health issues like anxiety or depression may be effectively controlled through physical treatment options. The common treatment choices are 1. Diet Human feelings are very well related to their dietary habits. The holistic counselors will take a comprehensive review of what a person eats daily and ask him to cease consuming processed foods, sugar, and alcohol. These things have close relation with anxiety and depression. 2. Senses Today, saltwater chambers and sensory deprivation chambers are used to heal the body and ensure optimal mental health functioning. These treatment choices will make a person feel good mentally and physically. 3. Spirituality Another best thing about holistic care is focusing on spirituality. A person who doesn't believe in the afterlife and overthinks often gets caught in anxiety and depression. They believe that their life is purposeless, leading to spiral out of control of the patient. Incorporating spirituality in the treatment plan helps a person forget bad experiences and believe in a better sense of self. 4. Body's alignment Mental health is also associated with the body's overall alignment. The therapies like yoga and chiropractic help properly align the body and keep it in sync mentally and physically. 5. Psychological care The combination of holistic counseling and the traditional method of counseling is highly popular. Talk therapy, exposure therapy, and hypnotism are examples. These treatments coordinate with the human brain and help a person to know about the feelings. This therapy can develop positivity in the person and allow him to spend a better life.
