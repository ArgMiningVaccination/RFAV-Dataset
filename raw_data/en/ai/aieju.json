The benefits will be felt in the body, mind, and the emotions. An easy cleanse you can do in the comfort of your own home. Shaktiveda Supported Group Cleanse In order to become healthy, or to maintain the good health that you may have, it is important to cleanse on a regular basis. Through our decades of cleansing experience, we have learned that it is best to have a cleanse that is effective, yet gentle and not harsh. At our Clinic, we have found that our patients enjoy having a support system as they go through their cleanse. Cleansing in a group promotes more enthusiasm and a deeper commitment. Everyone who is signed up for the cleanse will receive the benefit of Dr. Cravatta's healing energy and the effect of group consciousness that enhances each persons experience. Our group cleanse is designed for everyone to benefit. We offer several options so that it can be customized for your particular concerns and needs. We will be offering our Shaktiveda Group Cleanse 3 times per year - Winter, Spring, and Autumn. The cleanse is offered in two parts with both parts being 14 days. You may choose Part 1 or Part 2 depending on your cleansing needs or decide to join both parts. Most people will join Part 1 (liver cleanse) if they will only be doing one part. [Request more information (whatsapp)](https://wa.link/lbjxkk) Part 1 - Mind/Body Liver Cleanse Part 1 will begin Sunday, September 17, 2023. Ranjaka Shodhana (Liver Cleansing) herbalized oil is taken for the first 5 nights to loosen and release toxins and imbalances from the liver - both physically and emotionally. We are now offering the option to add a liver flush aspect to our liver cleanse. You will need to begin taking Liver Assist and Guggulu at least 10 days before the cleanse begins to soften and loosen the fatty deposits in the liver. Most cleansers do the liver flush aspect of the cleanse and you may also do a second liver flush if you also attend Part 2. Dr. Cravatta believes that it is important to not only have a healthy liver to create balance, but also to have balance within our hormones - thyroid and reproductive. During her informative cleanse conference calls, she places an emphasis on sharing information on these and other topics to assist you in creating health and well being within your life. Part 2 - Detox Veda Cleanse - 14 Day Turn Around Part 2 will begin on October 1, 2023 with our Premier Detox Veda Cleansing Program designed to release toxins, excess weight, and cellulite! Both internal and external herbal support is used including our wonderful Detox Veda Herbal Body Wrap. You need to experience it to truly appreciate the effectiveness of this herbal wrap. We call this 2 week cleanse the \"14 Day Turn Around\" - and you will see why once you have finished and see the amazing results! The Ultimate Mind / Body Cleanse [You may choose to do either Part 1 or Part 2 - and for those that want to make a significant difference, you may choose to do both Part 1 & Part 2. Both Part 1 and Part 2 will include Zoom Meetings at the beginning, middle and finish of your 2 week cleanse. In these calls, Dr. Cravatta will share invaluable knowledge and you will be able to ask questions. In addition, we will have a FaceBook Group Page for your cleanse, so that you may ask questions, give comments, or just chat with fellow group cleansers. Shakitveda Staff Members will be monitoring your questions so that you will have the support that you need. If during your cleanse you feel the need for additional support, you may desire to have a special consult with one of our Staff Members or with Dr. Cravatta.](https://i0.wp.com/shaktiveda.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/shiro_close.jpg) [You will begin the process with a mini-phone appointment with a Shaktiveda Ayurveda staff member. Our highly trained staff will assist you in deciding how to individualize your cleanse with herbal support. Once you have decided, you will be sent the necessary herbal products. We are very pleased to be offering you this in depth mind / body cleanse. Many cleanses just focus on a physical cleanse. With our Shakti Infused Herbal Products and our Awaken Within Yoga DVD we are able to assist you in addressing old mental or emotional imbalances along with physical toxins.](https://i0.wp.com/shaktiveda.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/foot_01.jpg) Both Part 1 and Part 2 of our Shaktiveda Group Cleanse is designed to be done for 2 weeks - which will allow you to release and renew so that you will begin feeling more balanced and more in touch with your bodily and emotional needs. During your Cleanse, you may continue with a somewhat regular routine as you do your at home cleansing. A specific diet is recommended for these days. If you have chosen to join us for both Parts, then your cleansing experience will be for 28 days. If you have a particular health concern, you may also choose to have a consultation with Dr. Cravatta in addition to your pre-cleanse phone consult with the Shaktiveda Staff Member.

Signing Up for the Cleanse Signing up is easy! You may pay for Part 1, our Liver Cleanse, on our website: [http://shaktiveda.com/product/group-liver-cleanse/](http://shaktiveda.com/product/group-liver-cleanse/). Or, you may call our Clinic: 530-273-8716. It is best that you sign up at least 2 weeks before the cleanse begins - as it gives you time to have your pre-cleanse phone consult and receive your herbal products. If you decide to do our liver flush option, we will have you take Liver Assist and Guggulu to begin the process of melting the liver / gall stones (which most people have). The sooner you begin this process, the better. If you would like to put even more of an emphasis on your liver, we suggest that you take Liver Assist even if you are not doing the liver flush.
