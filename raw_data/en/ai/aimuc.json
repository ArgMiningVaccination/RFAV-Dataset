Understanding the varying methods to assessmedication use is necessary to establish comparability and to understand the opportunitiesfor pharmacoepidemiological analysis. The objective of this review was to compare andcontrast how medication-related data have been collected in prospective cohorts of commu-nity-dwelling older Australians. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE (1990 -2014) were systematically searched to identify prospective cohorts of /C211000 older participants that commenced recruitment after 1990. The data col- lection tools used to assess medication use in each cohort were independently examinedby two investigators using a structured approach. Results Thirteen eligible cohorts were included. Baseline medication use was assessed in partici- pant self-completed surveys (n = 3), by an investigator inspecting medications brought to a clinic interview (n = 7), and by interviewing participants in their home (n = 3). Five cohortssought participant consent to access administrative claims data. Six cohorts used multiplemethods to assess medication use across one or more study waves. All cohorts assessedmedication use at baseline and 12 cohorts in follow-up waves. Twelve cohorts recordedprescription medications by trade or generic name; 12 cohorts recorded medicationstrength; and 9 recorded the daily medication dose in at least one wave of the cohort.Seven cohorts asked participants about their \"current \"medication use without providing a definition of \"current \"; and nine cohorts asked participants to report medication use over re- call periods ranging from 1-week to 3-months in at least one wave of the cohort.

Conclusion There has been considerable variability in the assessment of medication use within and between cohorts. This may limit the comparability of medication data collected in thesecohorts. Introduction Medications represent a major health intervention for the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic illness. Between 76% and 95% of community-dwelling older people take one or more prescription medications on a daily basis, and almost half take five or more [ 1,2]. While medication use usually leads to improved health outcomes [ 3], medication-related problems and adverse drug events (ADEs) are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in older people [ 4]. Prospective cohorts provide an opportunity to assess the patterns and predictors of medica- tion use at a population level. There has been considerable investment in these cohorts of older people in Australia over the past 25 years. These cohorts have been either general population-based or had a specific disease or clinical focus. Medication data have typically been collected for secondary research objectives or to use as covariates in multivariate analyses [ 5]. Medication use is complex to assess and report. Unlike other clinical parameters there are no universally accepted methods to collect and report medication use in cohort studies. Medi-cation use is highly variable in terms of dose, dose frequency and the specific active pharmaceu- tical ingredients that are used. Depending on the outcome of interest, both acute and cumulative exposure to medications may be relevant. Data collection methods need to be flexi-ble enough to take into account rapidly evolving therapeutics, yet sufficiently consistent that medication use can be compared over a long-term duration. Collecting medication data in prospective cohort studies is important because medication use may confound primary outcomes of interest if not appropriately accounted for. For exam- ple, cohorts investigating the incidence of falls should assess use of falls-risk medications [ 6]; cohorts investigating cognitive decline should assess use of medications that impair cognition[7]; and cohorts investigating glycaemic control should assess use of medications that impact blood glucose levels [ 8]. It is not known to what extent medication use has been comprehensively assessed in pro- spective cohorts of older Australians. Understanding the varying methods to assess medicationuse is necessary to establish comparability [ 9,10], and to understand the opportunities for pharmacoepidemiological analysis. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast how medication-related data have been collected in prospective cohorts of community-dwelling older Australians. Methods Search strategy A systematic review using MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to identify articles describ- ing eligible cohorts. The literature search was limited to articles published between January Review of Medication Use in Cohort Studies of Older Australians PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124247 April 24, 2015 2/1 51990 and March 2014, inclusive. In MEDLINE, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and trun- cated keywords related prospective cohorts ( \"cohort studies \"[MeSH] AND \"cohort \"in title terms were 'exploded 'to re- trieve results using the selected term and all the more specific terms within the MeSH tree structure. A keyword search via PubMed was performed to identify additional articles not yetindexed into MEDLINE. In used in place of \"cohort studies \". To identify Australian publications, ( \"Australia \"[MeSH] OR \"Australia /C3\") were combined with the Bool- ean operator 'AND 'in the command-line in each database. The search was limited to Human Studies in the English language. A manual search of Australian Government websites, including The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), the Commonwealth Department of Health, the Australian Bu- reau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Data Archive was conducted to identify relevant publications and reports. Reference lists of all included publications and reports were screenedfor additional relevant publications. See Fig 1 for PRISMA flowchart of studies involved in sys- tematic review. (The PRISMA Checklist is available as S1 PRISMA Checklist.) Inclusion and exclusion criteria Australian prospective cohorts that commenced baseline participant recruitment from 1990 and included 1000 or more participants were eligible for inclusion. Cohorts with a focus on community dwelling older people (defined as a mean age over 65 years) were considered. Co- horts that included a sub-cohort of community-dwelling older people were also considered.Multiple articles reporting results from the same cohort study were grouped together. If avail- able, the published protocol or cohort profile was reviewed to identify if medication use was listed as an exposure of interest. Only cohort studies for which the full data collection instru-ment was available in the public domain or by contacting the principal investigators were eligi- ble for inclusion. Retrospective cohorts that utilized administrative claims data as the only source of medication exposure data were excluded. Cohorts that focused on a population of'cases 'or participants with a specific disease were excluded. The review was limited to cohorts of 1000 or more participants because these studies repre- sented the greatest investment of investigator time and resources, were more likely to have thedata collection instruments available in the public domain, and were more likely to involvegeneral population-based samples from which results of medication-related analyses could be generalized. Data extraction Data collection tools from the included cohorts were reviewed independently by two investiga-tors using a structured data extraction instrument. The data collection tool from each cohort was reviewed against a list of key aspects of medication exposure assessment (see Table 1 ). The chief investigator of each of the included cohorts was given the opportunity to verify in- terpretation of the data extraction. Medication-related publications from the included cohorts To identify whether pharmacoepidemiological analyses had been published from each cohort,publication lists from the study websites were examined. An author search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed was also conducted using the names of the principal investigators of Review of Medication Use in Cohort Studies of Older Australians PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124247 April 24, 2015 3/1 5each cohort. All publications identified were screened by title and abstract to identify publica- tions with a quantitative pharmacoepidemiological analysis. The full text versions of all medi- cation-related publications were reviewed to assess whether the methods utilized cross- sectional or longitudinal medication exposure and outcome data. A description of the codingsystem employed to categorize medications was extracted. Analysis The medication exposure assessment in each cohort was summarized and compared descrip- tively. The medication-related publications arising from each cohort were reviewed and grouped according to the type of analyses conducted (i.e. cross-sectional baseline medication Fig 1.

Results Thirteen cohorts involving baseline participant recruitment from 1990 to 2006 were included (seeTable 2 ). All 13 cohorts had a health focus and 11 cohorts included a medical examination of participants in the longitudinal waves of the study. Four cohorts had a broad focus, examin-ing 'healthy aging 'or the burden of disease in an ageing population [ 11-14]; six focused on the development of a specific disease or range of related diseases or health issues as the cohort ages [15-20]; three had a focus on gender-related health issues [ 21-23], and two are large cohorts based on questionnaire-derived responses and data-linkage [ 11,21]. The included cohorts had a median of four 'waves 'of longitudinal data collection (range 2 -11); with seven cohorts ongo- ing and six complete. Assessment of medication use Table 3 summarizes the methods used to obtain medication exposure. All cohort studies uti- lized participant self-report to assess medication use at baseline: three cohorts used participant self-completed surveys [ 11,13,21]; seven cohorts asked participants to bring all their medica- tions to a clinic interview [ 15-17,19,20,22,23], and participants were interviewed in their homes in three cohorts [ 12,14,18]. In addition, three cohorts obtained participant consent to conduct data-linkage with the administrative claims data (i.e. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS)) at baseline [ 11,13,20]. In regards to follow-up data collection, only one cohort did not assess medication use after baseline [ 14]. Six cohorts used the same source or sources of data and data collection methods consistently across all study waves that included an assessment of medication [ 11,13,15,19, 20,22], the remaining six cohorts modified the medication-related questions at different time points of the study [ 12,16,17,18,21,23] and two of these studies changed the source of medi- cation data [ 12,21]. Three cohorts invited participants to provide a current medication list from their regular pharmacy as an additional source of medication data [ 16,17,21]. Reporting of medication exposure time was inconsistent between and within studies. Five of the 13 cohorts used different exposure time windows at different time points [ 16,17,18,21, 23] and one cohort did not define the exposure time window in one wave [ 21]. Seven cohortsTable 1.

Sixty-five publications, from the 13 in- cluded cohorts, had a specific medication focus (median = 3, range 1 -21). In total, 27 (42%) were cross-sectional and reported the prevalence and factors associated with baseline medica- tion use, 19 (29%) reported the association between the prevalence of baseline medication use and the incidence of one or more outcomes, and 17 (26%) reported the prevalence of medica-tion use at multiple waves. One cohort also described a protocol for applying pharmacoepide- miological analyses and another described the development of a unique coding system for medications to facilitate the pharmacoepidemiological analysis. An additional 22 publicationsfrom five of the included cohorts included the assessment of vitamin and minerals; herbal sup-plements or complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage in the cross-sectional (n = 15) or longitudinal (n = 7) analysis of health outcomes. Eight of the cohorts described the coding system used to classify medications for pharma- coepidemiological analysis in at least one of the publications reviewed. Four cohorts utilized the WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System; two cohorts grouped medications by 'drug class ', utilising the published product information; one utilized the MedCap classification system [ 24]; and one utilized Iowa Drug Information System (IDIS) drug code numbers. Publications from five cohorts did not describe the coding of medications. Discussion The main finding of this review was the variability, within and between cohort studies, in the methods utilized to assess medication use. This has resulted in inconsistencies in the compre- hensiveness of the data collected. The possible impact of these inconsistencies deserves further investigation. Variability and inconsistency in the methods to assess medication use within a study may limit the opportunity to conduct longitudinal analyses. The five most recent cohorts used a consistent approach to assess mediation use within the study [ 11,13,15,20,22]. This may re- flect a maturing in the understanding of the importance of medications to health outcomes.However, the benefits of using the same questions about medication exposure at each study wave may need to be traded-off against questionnaire length and ease of administration. All cohorts used participant self-report as the primary source of medication data. Asking participants to self-report their list of medications has the advantage that only medications ac- tually used by the participants are captured. However, participant self-report is subject to recall error and potential unwillingness to report [ 25]. Six cohorts obtained participant consent to ac- cess administrative claims data. Administrative claims data can be used to supplement self-re- port data and have been described as the 'gold-standard 'for medication exposure [ 26]. However, administrative claims data usually only include records of reimbursed medications,do not include non-prescription medications or CAMs, and do not consider non-adherence [27,28]. Other investigators have considered participant home interview as the gold standard for assessing medication use [ 29]. This method allows the investigator to inspect the contents of the medication cabinet. However, conducting home interviews is very resource intensive. Itis not clear from the published literature whether any of the 13 cohorts used medication lists obtained from each participant 's general medical practitioner or community pharmacy to sup- plement or validate participant self-reported medication lists. Three cohorts passively re-quested these data [ 16,17,21], however it is not clear to what extent these data were obtained. In those studies which conducted participant interviews, it is not clear whether all interviews were performed by the same researcher. It is unclear to what extent the clinical background of Review of Medication Use in Cohort Studies of Older Australians PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124247 April 24, 2015 10 / 15the researcher is important for collecting a complete medication list in prospective cohort studies. It is desirable to assess the prevalence, dose, duration and change in medication use over the course of a study [ 30]. Each of the 13 cohort studies assessed the prevalence of medication use at baseline. Incident user study designs are considered superior to prevalent user study designs for investigating medication outcomes. This is because prevalent users are the 'survivors 'of the early period of medication use and, therefore, may be less susceptible to adverse events [ 31]. In addition, covariates of medication use may be impacted by medication use itself and adjust- ment for these covariates on the causal pathway between the medication exposure and outcome may result in bias [ 31]. Only two cohorts obtained ongoing participant consent, from baseline, for linkage to administrative claims data that would enable the capture of incident medication use [ 11,13]. Unless medication use is assessed at multiple time-points it is not possible to analyse medi- cation use as a time-dependent exposure. Misclassification of exposure, by incorrectly identify- ing the use, dose or duration of medication use may result in biased effect estimates [ 32]. One of the 13 cohorts assessed medication exposure at baseline only [ 14]. Six of the included co- horts sought information about the 'duration of treatment 'for prevalent medication use at baseline or in a later wave of the study. Establishing the treatment duration may be important for establishing cumulative exposure. There was considerable variability in time periods over which participants were asked to re- port medication use [ 33]. Seven cohorts asked the participant to consider medications they take 'currently 'without providing an operational definition of current. Other cohorts used an exposure time window ranging from 1 week to 3-months. A shorter window is likely to im-prove the reliability and validity of the participant report; however it may result in medications used infrequently being missed [ 34]. Only one of the included cohorts sought data about anymedications that had been used previously [ 17]. Eight of the cohorts did seek information about 'ever 'use of specific medica- tions, providing the researchers the opportunity of assessing associations between health out- comes and exposure to medications that the participant was not taking at the time of report [11,16-18,20-23]. One aspect of medication exposure that has remained largely unexplored in Australian co- horts is that of adherence. Adherence to a prescribed medication is an integral component of medication effectiveness [ 35]. It is possible to estimate medication persistence from administra- tive claims data [ 36]. However, use of claims data alone does not permit exploration of consumer perceptions, preferences, attitudes and opinions about health and medication use [ 37-39]. Three of the included cohorts did seek information about the participant 's ability to manage medica- tions or use of dosage administration aids [ 14,21,23], both of which may influence the ability of the consumer to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen [ 40]. At least one medication-related paper has been published from each of the 13 included co- horts. Forty two percent of the publications (n = 27) reported cross-sectional analysis; 19(29%) reported the association between the prevalence of baseline medication use and the inci- dence of one or more health outcomes, and 17 (26%) reported the prevalence of medication use at multiple waves. The majority (70%) of the medication-related publications from the in-cluded cohorts have reported the prevalence of medication use at baseline without taking ad- vantage of the longitudinal assessments of medication use [ 32]. There are European initiatives to ensure consistency of pharmacoepidemiological methods [41]. Similarly, establishing consistency in the assessment of medication exposure will enable greater comparison within and between cohort studies. This review has identified aspects of Review of Medication Use in Cohort Studies of Older Australians PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124247 April 24, 2015 11 / 15medication exposure that would be worthwhile to consider when establishing a standard ap- proach to the design and analysis of cohort studies. Strengths and limitations One strength of this study is that the investigators of each of the included cohorts were given the opportunity to verify interpretation of the data extraction. We reviewed the data collectionmethods and tools for each phase of the included cohorts. It was not possible to confirm the quality of data actually collected in each cohort or how missing data were handled in the analy- ses. The review inclusion criteria resulted in number of well-known Australian cohorts beingexcluded. A number of the excluded cohorts included medication exposure as a covariate of in- terest. However, appraisal of these cohorts demonstrated similar issues as identified in this re- view [ 5,42-44]. Not all study websites contained a current comprehensive list of publications arising from the study. It is possible that reports of some pharmacoepidemiological analyseswere not retrieved. Future directions Based on the findings of this review we recommend that people with expertise in pharmacoepi-demiology are involved in the initial design of new cohort studies. There are also opportunitiesfor further research arising from this review. There is a need to develop consensus around ac- ceptable methods to collect and report medication use in cohort studies. The convergence to- wards consistency in methods that has been identified, in later cohorts, in this study, may serveas basis for such consensus. Recommendations for standardized definitions and a minimumdata set for the assessment of medication exposure would reduce future variability and improve reliability of future cohorts. If a standardized tool was developed to assess medication use it would be of potential benefit in other branches of clinical research, including clinical trials andcross-sectional surveys [ 2,45]. Conclusion There has been variability within and between cohorts in the methods used to assess medica- tion exposure. Opportunities exist to improve the methods utilized through the developmentof standardized definitions and a minimum data set for the assessment of medication exposurewithin cohorts. This may reduce future variability and improve comparability of results of fu- ture cohort studies. Supporting Information S1 PRISMA Checklist. (PDF) S1 Table.
