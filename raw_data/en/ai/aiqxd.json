These terms are often interchanged during conversations about alternative medicine practices \u2014 so it can be hard to know what each specific term is referring to. With the ever-increasing number of people looking for non-traditional medical support for their medical conditions and overall health, it can be important to understand the difference between terminology. So, what are homeopathy and holistic medicine? Let's explore the difference to learn more about each treatment option! Holistic medicine Holistic medicine is more of a category of medical practice rather than a specific treatment option. Used to describe many complementary or alternative medicine practices, holistic medicine is all about getting a complete picture of every medical condition. Holistic medicine practitioners focus on treating the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of health. There are [five main categories](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam) of holistic medicine: Mind-Body Therapies \u2014 These holistic medicine practices are based on building connections between body movements, breathing, and mental health. Examples include meditation, yoga, tai chi, and hypnosis. Biologically Based Practices \u2014 Many holistic medicine practitioners specialize in supplement and vitamin replacement therapies. Examples include supplements and botanical use for improved health. Manipulative and Body-Based Practices \u2014 A more physical approach to holistic medicine, this field includes practitioners who focus on movement and muscle relaxation. Examples include massage, chiropractic care and reflexology. Biofield Therapy \u2014 Also called energy medicine, this form of holistic medicine uses pressure points and energy practices to improve health. Examples include reiki and therapeutic touch. Whole Medicine Systems \u2014 These holistic medicine therapies are based on years of cultural and historical medicine. Examples include naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and homeopathy.

Homeopathy Homeopathy is a type of complementary medicine that is over 200 years old. Homeopathic medicine is based on [two theories](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy): - \"Like cures like\" \u2014 homeopathic practitioners believe that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people. - \"The law of minimum dose\" \u2014 homeopaths believe that the lower the dose of medication, the more effective it will be. Homeopathic health products are created from natural and organic plants, minerals and vitamins. Many of these supplements can be taken under the tongue, swallowed or applied to the skin. A homeopathic practitioner takes a very detailed medical history of each of their patients. From this information, a personalized treatment plan is created on the person's unique health needs. What is the difference between homeopathy and holistic medicine? Homeopathy and holistic medicine are different but interconnected terms. Holistic medicine is a blanket term for alternative medicine practices - and homeopathy is a form of whole-body holistic complementary medicine. While these terms can be used interchangeably, it is important to remember that homeopathy is a unique and separated practice with different guiding principles.
