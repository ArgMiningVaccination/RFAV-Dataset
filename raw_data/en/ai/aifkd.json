Piperlongumine (PL) was recently identified as a novel senolytic agent. However, its mechanism of action and molecular targets in SCs was unknown and thus was investigated. Specifically, we used a PL-based chemical probe to pull-down PL-binding proteins from live cells and then mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify potential molecular tar-gets of PL in SCs. One prominent target was oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1), an important antioxidant protein that regulates the expression of a variety of antioxi- dant enzymes. We found that OXR1 was upregulated in senescent human WI38 fibroblasts. PL bound to OXR1 directly and induced its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in an SC-specific manner. The knockdown of OXR1 expression by RNA interference significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species in SCs in conjunction with the downregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1, glutathione peroxidase 2, and catalase, but these effects were much less significant when OXR1 was knocked down in non-SCs. More importantly, knocking down OXR1 selectively induced apoptosis in SCs and sensitized the cells to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which SCs are highly resistant to oxida- tive stress and suggest that OXR1 is a novel senolytic target that can be further exploited for the development of new senolytic agents.

Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Accepted: 1 April 2018 DOI: f1 41|INTRODUCTION cycle arrest is trig- gered by telomere shortening or exposure to stress (Campisi, 2013). The induction of cellular senescence has many beneficial effects, including preventing tumorigenesis, promoting wound healing and tissue remodeling, and contributing to embryonic development (Mu ~noz-Esp /C19n & Serrano, 2014). However, senescent cells (SCs) accumulate if they cannot be removed rapidly by the immune system due to immune dysfunction and/or a sustained, overwhelmingincrease in SC production. This occurs during aging or under certain pathological conditions (Childs et al., 2017; Mu ~noz-Esp /C19n & Serrano, 2014). Under these circumstances, SCs can be detrimental and play a causal role in aging, age-related diseases, and chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced side effects, in part through the expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (Childs et al., 2017; Mu~noz-Esp /C19n & Serrano, 2014). This hypothesis is supported by recent studies demonstrating that the genetic clearance of SCs pro- longs the lifespan of mice and delays the onset of several age- related diseases and disorders in both progeroid and naturally aged mice (Baker et al., 2011, 2016). Therefore, the pharmacological clear-ance of SCs with a small molecule, a senolytic agent that can selec- tively kill SCs, is potentially a novel anti-aging strategy and a new treatment for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced side effects (Baar et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2016; Childs et al., 2016; Demaria et al., 2017; Jeon et al., 2017; Ogrodnik et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Schafer et al., 2017; Yosef et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015). However, a major challenge facing the discovery and develop- ment of effective senolytic agents is to identify and validate more senolytic targets. Since the first senolytic was published (Zhu et al.,2015), twelve molecular targets have been identified (Childs et al., 2017), including the prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins (Chang et al., 2016; Yosef et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016) and forkhead Box O4 (FOXO4) (Baar et al., 2017). These findings led to the discovery of a few senolytic agents, including ABT-263 and ABT-737, two Bcl-2/xl/ w inhibitors, and FOXO4-DRI, a peptide molecule that interferes with the interaction of FOXO4 and p53. Unfortunately, the clinical application of these senolytic agents for age-related diseases and cytotoxic cancer therapy-induced side effects may be limited because of the toxicity of Bcl-2/xl/w inhibitors and the difficulty of developing effective high molecular-weight peptide therapeutics.Therefore, identification of new SC molecular targets is in urgent need for the development of novel small molecule senolytic agents. Piperlongumine (PL) is one of a few natural products identified to have the ability to selectively kill SCs (Wang et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015, 2017). Compared to other known senolytic agents, PL has the advantage of low toxicity, an excellent PK/PD profile, and oral bioavailability (Raj et al., 2011). However, PL has a relatively higher EC 50value against SCs compared with ABT-263 (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, its molecular target(s) and mechanism of action areunknown. To facilitate the development of PL and its analogues as senolytic drug candidates, it is critical to identify PL moleculartargets, which can form a molecular basis for the rational design of new PL analogues. Herein, we report the identification and validation of oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) as a molecular target of PL in SCs. OXR1 is a cellular oxidative stress sensor that regulates the expression of a variety of antioxidant enzymes and modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis (Oliver et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015). We found that OXR1 was upregulated in SCs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) or extensive replication. PL bound to OXR1 directly and induced its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in an SC-spe- cific manner. Knocking down OXR1 selectively induced apoptosis in SCs and sensitized the cells to oxidative stress caused by hydrogenperoxide (H 2O2). These findings suggest that OXR1 is a potential senolytic target that can be exploited for the development of selec- tive senolytic agents with improved potency and selectivity. In addi- tion, these findings also provide new insight into the mechanism by which SCs are highly resistant to oxidative stress. 2|RESULTS 2.1 |Design and synthesis of PL probes The structure of PL features two Michael acceptors (electrophiles), the C2 -C3 and C7 -C8 olefins (Figure 1a) (Adams et al., 2012). Our previous studies showed that both Michael acceptors were impor- tant for the senolytic activity of PL (Wang et al., 2016), indicating that PL may act as an irreversible inhibitor through the conjugatedaddition of the nucleophiles (e.g., cysteine residue) on its target pro- tein(s) to the Michael acceptors. Taking advantage of the covalent interaction between PL and its target protein(s), we designed PL probes that can be \"tagged \"for protein purification and identification in live cells (Figure 1a). Our structure -activity relationship studies revealed that modifications on the trimethoxyphenyl group of PL were tolerated, and an affinity tag could be attached to the para- position of the phenyl ring. We thus synthesized PL probes that con- tain a terminal alkyne. These probes can be used to enrich target proteins by reacting with the corresponding immobilized azide through a bio-orthogonal copper-catalyzed azide S1) (Kolb & Sharpless, 2003), which allows us to perform mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis to identify the target proteins. Through a cell-based senolytic activity assay (Figure 1b), we selected a PL probe (Figure 1a) with the same senolytic activity as PL to be used in our target-protein identification study. As a negative control, we designed a structurally related compound in which the C7 -C8 double bond of the PL probe is saturated (CTL probe, Figure 1a); we modified this bond because previous studies suggested that theMichael acceptor at the PL C7 -C8 olefin can facilitate target-protein binding after reacting with glutathione (Adams et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2011). The CTL probe was used to subtract nonspecific proteins pulled down by our PL probe. As expected, the CTL probe was ~9-fold less2o f1 4 | ZHANG ET 1000255075100125 Concentration RE-SCsPL probe Proteomic analysisNCs, IR-SCs, or RE-SCs PL/CTL probe PL PL (M) + - 1.25 - - - PL-Biotin (M) - 0.25 0. 25 0.025 0.1 0.6 Pull down OXR1 Input -actinPL (M) - - - 5.0 PL-Biotin (M) - 0.1 0.6 0.6 Input hrOXR1 PL-Biotin-hrOXR1 (e) (f) FIGURE 1 Identification and validation of OXR1 as a target of PL.

To further exclude proteins that bound nonspecifi-cally to PL probe, we also carried out competitive-binding experi- ments in which IR-SCs were incubated with an excess of PL for 2 hr then with the PL probe for 3 hr or vice versa (Figure 1c). After excluding proteins that were bound by the CTL probe, we identified 436 proteins in NCs that bound the PL probe, 890 proteins in IR- SCs, and 702 proteins in RE-SCs (Figure 1d). Among these, 270 pro- teins were unique to both IR-SCs and RE-SCs, and 360 proteins were common to all three cell types. From the 360 common pro- teins, we identified 49 SC-selective targets that had an enrichment ratio of 2 (i.e., the LFQ intensity of proteins in IR-SCs and RE-SCs was 2-fold higher than those in NCs) and a PL competition ratio of 2 (i.e., the LFQ intensity of proteins on cells treated with the PL probe followed by PL was 2-fold higher than those in the cells trea- ted with PL followed by the PL probe). Similarly, using a PL competi- tion ratio of 2 as a cutoff, 123 SC-unique proteins were retained on the final list as SC-specific targets (Figure 1d; for the protein list, see Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). Overall, we identified 172 potential senolytic targets (123 SC- specific targets plus 49 SC-selective targets) of PL. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these PL targets were mainly involved inthe regulation of protein transport and localization, autophagy, TOR signaling, protein phosphorylation, and ubiquitination (Supporting Information Table S3). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the PL- target proteins were mainly enriched in endocytosis, phosphatidyli- nositol signaling system, inositol phosphate metabolism, mTORsignaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway (Supporting Infor- mation Table S4). We found that OXR1 was on the top of the list of the PL-bind- ing proteins in SCs (Supporting Information Table S2). OXR1 is cru- cial for protecting cells against oxidative stress by regulating the expression of several enzymes that detoxify ROS (Jaramillo-Gutier- rez, Molina-Cruz, Kumar & Barillas-Mury, 2010; Oliver et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015), and it may be particularly important as a senolytic target of PL because SCs are known to produce high levels of ROS but remain resistant to oxidative stress (Supporting Information & Finkel, LMD-3, homolog of OXR1 in Caenorhabditis ele- gans, has to protect against oxidative stress and acceler- ated aging in the worm (Sanada et al., 2014). Therefore, we validated whether PL could bind OXR1 directly using a biotin-labeled PL probe (Raj et al., 2011). This PL probe pulled down OXR1 from SC lysates and bound directly to recombinant human OXR1 (rhOXR1) in a dose-dependent manner, which was prevented with an excess of PL (Figure 1e, f). Taken together, these results demon- strate that PL binds OXR1 directly, suggesting that OXR1 may be a senolytic target of PL. 2.3 |PL selectively reduces the level of OXR1 in IR-SCs by inducing its degradation To further confirm that OXR1 is a senolytic target of PL, we exam- ined the effect of PL on OXR1 expression in NCs and IR-SCs. We found that IR induced a time-dependent increase in OXR1 mRNA and OXR1 protein in WI-38 which correlated closely with the (Figure 2a -c). PL treatment had no significant effect on the levels of OXR1 mRNA and protein in NCs (Figure 2d, e). In contrast, PL substantially reduced the levels of OXR1 protein but had no effect on OXR1 mRNA expression in IR- SCs, suggesting that PL regulates OXR1 in IR-SCs post-transcription- ally, possibly by inducing its degradation. Indeed, the PL-induced FIGURE 2 PL selectively decreases the level of OXR1 in SCs, in part by inducing OXR1 proteasomal degradation.

Moreover, we found that PL selectively increased the levels of poly-ubiquitylated proteinsin IR-SCs, but not in NCs (Figure 2g); and IR-SCs treated with PL had higher levels of both mono-ubiquitinated OXR1 and poly-ubiqui- tylated OXR1 than those treated with vehicle (Figure 2h). Collec- tively, these results suggest that PL can selectively reduce the levels of OXR1 in SCs, in part by inducing the proteasomal degradation of OXR1. 2.4 |More intracellular PL in IR-SCs than NCs To understand the mechanism by which PL selectively induced thedegradation of OXR1 in IR-SCs, we measured the levels of PL in NCs and IR-SCs by taking advantage of our alkyne-bearing PL probe. Specifically, NCs and IR-SCs were incubated with the PL probe, and its levels were determined by a Click Chemistry reaction with Alexa Fluor 488 azide after the free probe was removed. With fluores- cence microscopy, we found that IR-SCs appeared to have a higher level of the PL probe than NCs (Figure 3a). To quantify the differ- ence in the intracellular levels of the PL probe between NCs and IR- SCs, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the Alexa Fluor 488-PL probe with flow cytometry after the MFI wasnormalized by cell size according to the forward scatter (FSC) mea- surement because SCs are bigger than NCs (Figure 3b). We found that IR-SCs had a significantly higher level of intracellular PL probe than NCs. This finding was also confirmed by analysis with an Ima- geStream flow cytometer after considering the difference in cell size measured by the average area of cells between NCs and IR-SCs (Fig- ure 3c). These results suggest that IR-SCs may uptake and retain more PL or degrade less PL than NCs, which may contribute to the selective induction of OXR1 degradation and cell death in SCs byPL. 2.5 |Knocking down OXR1 selectively kills IR-SCs by downregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and sensitizing the cells to oxidative stress OXR1 is an important antioxidant protein that protects cells from oxidative stress by regulating the expression of enzymes that detox- ify ROS, such as glutathione peroxidase 2 (GTX2), heme 1 (HO-1), and (Jaramillo-Gutierrez et al., 2010; Oliver et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015). SCs are known to produce highlevels of ROS, but they are highly resistant to oxidative stress (Chan- drasekaran et al., 2017; Davalli et al., 2016; Lee et al., 1999; Lu & Finkel, 2008). This resistance may be due to the increased expres- sion of OXR1 and its downstream targets in SCs; therefore, OXR1 may be a genuine senolytic target. To test this hypothesis, we used two different OXR1 shRNAs (shOXR1-1 and shOXR1-2) to knock down the expression of OXR1 in both NCs and IR-SCs (Figure 4a). We found that shOXR1-1 was slightly more effective than shOXR1- 2 at knocking down OXR1 in both cell types; thus, we used shOXR1-1 (referred to as shOXR1) for the rest of the study.As expected, IR-SCs expressed significantly higher levels of the known downstream targets of OXR1, that is, GTX2 and HO-1 and CAT, and other antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1 ) and SOD2 than NCs (Figure 4b). Knocking down OXR1 slightly reduced the expression of HO-1 and CAT mRNA but not GTX2 mRNA, in NCs. In contrast, IR-SCs showed a greater reduction inGTX2 ,HO-1, and CAT mRNA expression after OXR1 knockdown. Knocking down OXR1 also moderately reduced the expression of SOD-1 andSOD-2 NCs tantly, knocking down OXR1 significantly reduced the viability of IR- SCs, but not NCs (Figure 4c). These findings suggest that OXR1 may be a novel senolytic target. To determine whether OXR1 knockdown selectively killed IR-SCs through oxidative stress, we measured ROS production and apopto- sis in IR-SCs and NCs after transfection with control shRNA (shCtrl) or shOXR1 in the presence or absence of the antioxidant N-acetyl- cysteine (NAC). The IR-SCs produced significantly higher levels of ROS than NCs, and IR-SCs produced even more ROS after knock- down of OXR1 (Figure 4d). This increase in ROS was associated with a significant increase in apoptosis in IR-SCs after knocking down OXR1 (Figure 4e). Importantly, the increases in ROS and apoptosis in IR-SCs induced by shOXR1 were abrogated by NAC. In contrast, knocking down OXR1 in NCs only slightly increased ROS production, but this had no significant effect on NC apoptosis. These results sug- gest that knocking down OXR1 selectively kills IR-SCs by sensitizing them to oxidative stress and inducing apoptosis. This is supported by our finding that knocking down OXR1 also sensitized IR-SCs but not NCs to H 2O2-induced cell death and apoptosis, and this was abrogated by NAC (Figure 4f, g). 2.6 |Knockdown of OXR1 also induces apoptosis in RE-SCs by downregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and increasing ROS production To determine whether OXR1 is a general senolytic target that is not specific to IR-SCs, we examined the expression of OXR1 in RE-SCs generated after extensive replication of WI-38 cells in vitro. We found that RE-SCs, like IR-SCs, also expressed increased levels of OXR1 and its downstream targets (Figure 5a, b). Knocking down OXR1 significantly reduced the expression of GPX2, HO-1, and CAT, the known downstream targets of OXR1 (Figure 5c, d), and this increased ROS production and apoptosis in RE-SCs (Figure 5e, f). These findings suggest that OXR1 is alsoimportant for RE-SCs to counteract oxidative stress, which is in agreement with our observation that RE-SCs are also sensitive to PL treatment (Figure 1b). 3|DISCUSSION Resistance to apoptosis and oxidative stress is a SCs(Childs, Campisi & Van Deursen, 2014; Childset al., that can be exploited to develop senolytic agents that6o f1 4 | ZHANG ET AL.(a) (c)(b)IR-SCsNCs PL probe DAPI Merge NCs IR-SCs NCs IR-SCs01020304050Normalized PL probe fluorescence*PL probe Veh NCs IR-SCs0.00.51.01.52.0Releative MFI of PL probe* Alexa Flour 488 Alexa Flour 488Cell counts Cell countsNCs IR-SCsNCs IR-SCs FIGURE 3 IR-SCs have higher levels of PL than NCs.

Thus, it is important that we continue searching for novel senolytic targets to develop safer senolytic agents. In the present study, we used an MS-based proteomic approach to identify the direct protein targets of PL in SCs, hop- ing to find new senolytic targets that can be exploited for the development of a safer senolytic drug because PL is a relatively nontoxic, natural product (Adams et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016). We designed a PL-derived probe with senoly- tic properties similar to PL that can be tagged to resins via a bio-orthogonal Click Reaction, allowing us to isolate proteins that interact covalently with the probe. Because it can be used with live cells, this approach allowed us to identify more biologically relevant targets than a traditional cell lysate-based approach with a biotin-labeled probe, which is not cell permeable and is not active in live cells as a senolytic agent (data not shown). With this approach, we identified 172 potential senolytic targets of PL. These targets have no overlap with known PL-target proteins that were identified in cancer cell lysates with a biotin-labeled PL probe (Raj et al., 2011), suggesting that PL may have different tar- gets in SCs and cancer cells. Among these possible senolytic targets of PL, we pursued OXR1 because it helps protect cells from oxidative stress by regulating several ROS-detoxifying enzymes (Jaramillo-Gutierrez et al., 2010; Oliver et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015). Our studies showed that OXR1 is upregulated in both prematurely SCs induced by IR and replicative SCs in conjunction with the increased production of ROS and elevated expression of OXR1-regulated ROS-detoxifying enzymes such as GPX2, HO-1, and CAT. In SCs, PL binds OXR1 directly and induces its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomesystem; this results, in part, from a differential ability of SCs and NCs to take up PL. Genetic knockdown of OXR1 resulted in the selective killing of SCs by disarming their defense against oxidative stress, because the induction of SC apoptosis by knocking down OXR1 was associated with downregulation of GPX2, HO-1, and CAT mRNA and increased production of ROS, and this was prevented by the antioxidant NAC. These findings and our observations that PL induces the proteasomal degradation of OXR1 and apoptosis of SCs suggest that OXR1 is a senolytic target that has the potential to be exploited for the development of novel senolytic agents, including PL analogs. This study identifies OXR1 as a potential target of PL to mediate PL senolytic activity. However, PL can bind hundreds of proteins in SCs. It has yet to be determined whether other PL-binding proteins also play a role in mediating the effect of PL on SCs. In addition, we observed that PL increased the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins in IR-SCs (Figure 2g), suggesting that PL may also induce dysregula- tion of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system and proteostasis in SCs. Whether the dysregulation induced by PL contributes to PL-induced SC, apoptosis has yet to be investigated.4|EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 4.1 |Cell culture and induction of senescence Cell culture and senescence induction were performed as described before (Chang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). See the details in Supporting Information Data S1. 4.2 |Cell viability assays Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry, as previouslydescribed (Chang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Dose -response curves were generated, and the half-maximal effective concentra- tions (EC 50values) were calculated with GraphPad Prism 6 software. 4.3 |Chemicals PL was purchased from BioVision (catalog no. 1919-10; Milpitas, CA). 4.4 |Procedures for the synthesis of the PL probe, CTL probe, and PL-biotin See details in Supporting Information Data S1. 4.5 |PL-target protein pull down The pull-down experiments were carried out using the Click-&-GoTM- Protein Enrichment Kit (Product No. 1039, Bioconjugate Technology Company, Scottsdale, AZ) by following the protocol from the manu-facturer. Briefly, nonsenescent WI38 cells (RE- SCs) were plated on 10-cm Petri dishes. The cells were incubated with PL probe or CTL probe at 5 lM for 5 hr, harvested, and lysed in a lysis buffer as described in the protocol. The concentration of the total protein was measured by NanoDrop. The same amount of total protein (4.48 mg in 800 ll) from each cell type was incubated with azide-agarose resin in the presence of a copper catalyst solu- tion overnight at room temperature, followed by reduction in 10 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) and alkylation in 40 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). The resin was washed, followed by on-column pro-tease digestion, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described below. To exclude the nonspecific binding proteins, competitive-binding experi- ments were performed in which IR-SCs were incubated with 5 lM PL for 2 hr then incubated with 5 lM PL probe for 3 hr. In parallel, IR-SCs were initially incubated with 5 lM PL probe for 2 hr then incubated with 5 lM PL for 3 hr. We repeated the CTL and PL probe binding assays and proteomics analyses two to three times for each cell type. PL selective and specific targets were identified using the combination of an enrichment ratio of 2 (i.e., the average spec- tra reads in IR-SCs and RE-SCs were 2-fold higher than those in NCs) and a PL competition ratio of 2 (i.e., the spectra reads on cells10 of 14 | ZHANG ET AL.treated with the PL probe followed by PL were 2-fold higher than those in the cells treated with PL followed by the PL probe), as described in the manuscript. 4.6 |LC-MS/MS analysis and protein identification LC-MS/MS analysis and protein identification were performed afterthe procedure as described before (Sengupta et al., 2016). Briefly, trypsin was added to the solution to release peptides from the beads for affinity purification. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% Pierce formic acid (catalog no. 28905, Thermo Fisher Scien- tific, Grand Island, NY). The peptides were desalted using C18 Sep-Pak and dried by speed-vac. Tryptic separated by reverse-phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a 200 90.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profilemode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1,500 m/ z. Following HCD activation, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0. Proteins were identified by database search using Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) with a parent ion tolerance of 3 ppm and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da. Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) was used to verify MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted ifthey could be established with less than 1.0% false discovery by the Scaffold Local false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm and con- tained at least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Keller, Kolker & Aebersold, 2003). 4.7 |Raw data processing All raw files were analyzed together using software MaxQuant (Cox & Mann, 2008) (version 1.5.3.30) as described before (Keilhauer, Hein & Mann, 2015) with minor modification. The derived peak listwas searched with the built-in Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) against the reference human proteome downloaded from Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/) on 04-20-2016 (176,494 sequences). Strict trypsin specificity was required with cleavage C- terminal after K or R, allowing up to two missed cleavages. The minimum required peptide length was set to seven amino acids. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and N-acetylation of proteins N termini and oxidation of methion- ine were set as variable modifications. As no labeling was per-formed, multiplicity was set to 1. During the main search, parentmasses were allowed an initial mass deviation of 4.5 ppm, and frag- ment ions were allowed a mass deviation of 0.5 Da. PSM and pro- tein identifications were filtered using a target-decoy approach at aFDR of 1%. The second peptide feature was enabled. The match between runs option was also enabled with a match time window of 0.7 min and an alignment time window of 20 min. Relative, label-free quantification of proteins was performed using the MaxLFQ algorithm (Cox et al., 2014) integrated into MaxQuant. The parameters were as follows: Minimum ratio count was set to 1, the FastLFQ option was enabled, LFQ minimum number of neighbors was set to 3, and the LFQ average number of neighbors was set to 6, as per default. The \"ProteinGroups \"output file from MaxQuant is available in the supplement (Supporting Information Table S1). 4.8 |Bioinformatics analysis The GO enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of identified PL-target proteins were obtained from the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource (http://david.nia id.nih.gov). pValue <0.05 was used as a cutoff for the enriched items in both GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. 4.9 |Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed according to our previous pub-lication (Chang et al., 2016). See the details in Supporting cell lysate A total of 1.2 mg of proteins from the lysates of IR-SCs in 300 ll lysis buffer (Cat# BP-115DG, Boston BioProducts, Ashland, MA) was incubated with the biotin-labeled PL probe in the presence or absence of a fivefold excess of PL overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and the mixture was then incubated with PierceTMhigh capacity streptavidin agarose beads (20359, Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature. Unbound proteins were washed away, and the bound proteins were released by boiling in 1 9SDS loading buffer at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. The released proteins were detected by Western blot analysis, as described above, with the OXR1 antibody (Cat# A30-035A, Bethyl). 4.10.2 bated with biotin-labeled PL probe in the absence or presence of a fivefold excess of unlabeled PL. The mixture was separated by SDS- PAGE, and an immunoblot was performed with antibodies (Streptavidin to the biotin-labeled PL probe. An immunoblot of OXR1 from each reaction was included as an input control. 4.11 |SA-b-galactosidase (SA- b-gal) staining See the procedure as described before (Chang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). See the details in Supporting Information Data S1. 4.12 |RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis Cells were lysed, and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74106, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). RNA (1 lg) was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript II first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Germantown, MD). Real-time PCR was performed using specific primers (Supporting Information Table S5) and the SYBR Green ROX Mix (Thermo Scientific). The sequence of the primers is given below. All experiments were performed in two to three repli- cates, and data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH . 4.13 |Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay IR-SCs were treated with or without PL (10 lM) for 6 hr and then were harvested for Co-IP assay using the Co-IP kit (cat# 26149,Thermo Fisher Scientific) the protocol from the manufac- turer. MG132 (1 lM) was added during treatment to inhibit protein degradation. Briefly, 5 lg rabbit anti-OXR1 antibody (Cat# A302- (Cat# 2729S, CST) was immobilized to the column, and 750 lg total lysate protein was added to the resin in the column. The precipitated protein was ana- lyzed for OXR1 ubiquitination by b-actin as indicated. 4.14 |Analysis of intracellular levels of PL by Click Chemistry NCs and IR-SCs were incubated with 5 lM PL probe or vehicle for 5 hr, and Alexa Fluor azide 488 was added to detect the PL uptake efficiency following the Click-It EdU imaging kit protocol (C10337, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The levels of PL in cells were visualized by microscopy then quantified by flow cytometry and ImageStream flow cytometry. For microscopy, images were taken with the ZEISS imagesystem as described before (Chang et al., 2016). For flow cytometry, after fixing and staining, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to the PL probe inside the cells was measured with a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The MFI of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated PL probe was normalized by cell size which was measured with FSC measurement. For ImageStream flow cytometry, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to the PL probe was quantified with ImageStreamX Mark II System (Amnis, Merck Millipore, Germany) following the instruc- tions from the manufacturer, and then normalized by cell size whichwas measured by the average area of cells.4.15 |Knockdown of OXR1 with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) We followed the procedure as described before (Chang et al., 2016) with some modifications. See the details in Supporting Information Data S1. 4.16 |ROS measurement and apoptosis assay ROS and apoptosis were measured with flow cytometry as previ-ously described (Wang et al., 2016). See the details in Supporting Information Data S1.
