According to Dr. Takuji Shirasawa, a Japanese brain surgeon, ginger can help the brain eliminate toxins, prevent brain aging and dementia, and enhance immunity. Ginger is a plant that originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was [introduced and cultivated](https://www.pharm.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/yakusodb/detail/003392.php) in Japan more than 2,600 years ago. The root of ginger is widely used in Japanese cuisine. It helps relieve summer fatigue, warms the body in winter, and boosts the immune system when eaten in moderation. In his new book \" [Brain Detox Diet,](https://www.amazon.co.jp/o/ASIN/4478110255/booksonlinea-22/)\" Shirasawa mentions that the modern brain has accumulated a lot of toxins, which will gradually slow brain function, causing brain fog, forgetfulness, dementia, and other symptoms. This accumulation may even lead to serious disease. Alzheimer's disease is a cognitive disorder caused by the degeneration of the brain. The patient's brain gradually shrinks, adversely affecting perception, thinking, memory, and other functions. In a 2021 interview published in [Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8594968/), American neurologist Dr. Dale Bredesen stated that four significant factors contribute to Alzheimer's disease: inflammation, toxicity, energy, and nutritional support. Another book edited by Shirasawa, \" [No No Wakagaeri Shoga Kenko Ho Tabete Nagaiki! No Ga Ikiki](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4058018739/)!\" (the ginger health method that makes the brain younger), also mentions Bredesen's theory and points out that ginger has the effect of preventing brain aging. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties, and the curcumin and gingerols in ginger also have potent antioxidant effects, thus preventing both brain and body aging. Ginger can also [enhance the detoxification](https://gkp-koushiki.gakken.jp/2022/08/25/50990/) function of the brain, addressing accumulated toxins such as harmful metals, mold, periodontal bacteria, intestinal bacteria, and others. Ginger dilates peripheral blood vessels, can improve blood flow, and help the brain better discharge toxic waste, which slows aging. Shirasawa recommends that people incorporate ginger into their regular diet. In addition to various dishes that include ginger, you can drink ginger lemonade before meals, promoting liver detoxification. Here's another example of ginger's ability to improve blood flow. Minoru Iwate, who works for a large Japanese company, recalled in an interview with The Epoch Times that one day in November 2021, he was walking home from work. He could not move his right leg. \"I couldn't move my leg after experiencing an indescribable stabbing pain for about five minutes. The pain lasted about two weeks and I was thinking of buying a cane, walker, or something like that,\" Iwate said. \"During this, I saw a video about ginger being effective for the same symptoms, so I tried it. After only two days of taking it, the numbness in my legs disappeared.\" In addition to revitalizing the brain, ginger has many health benefits. Mr. Saito, a pharmacist in a Japanese drugstore, told The Epoch Times that ginger contains active compounds that promote improved insulin levels and metabolism. This is because raising insulin levels can reduce the risk of diabetes. Drinking ginger tea can also reduce bad breath. According to Saito, ginger is widely used in Japan. Japanese people like to consume raw fish and raw meat sliced with ginger. Eating ginger this way has a bactericidal effect and can reduce bacteria that cause food poisoning. He mentioned that ginger is also commonly cooked with pork slices and eaten with vegetarian noodles in summer, which can help the body sweat and release residual heat that causes discomfort. It can also reduce swelling. In winter, ginger can promote blood circulation and warm the body. \"Ginger is now used as a bathing agent in bathrooms to reduce symptoms of joint pain, frozen shoulder, and rheumatism, as well as to promote blood circulation and relieve fatigue,\" Saito says.
