CHART provides the opportunity for practices to check the information before it is submitted to PRIMIS and ImmForm. This specification is also provided to GP Suppliers to enable submission of data to be standardised and quality a ssured nationally. This specification is for vaccine uptake monitoring purposes only. It is important that it is not used for recall or payment purposes. The P regnancy groups include patients who may have been eligible for a period of time but are no longer eligible . Due to the complications around recording pregnancy, other methods should be used if practices wish to identify patients who are at risk and requi re vaccination. Any results should be subject to clinical review. The University of Nottingham cannot take any responsibility or liability for use of this specification for any purpose other than its intended use for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Uptake Monitoring Programme.PRIMIS Specification Seasonal_Flu_LQD_ Specification_ V7.0 Page 2 of 53 31st July 2014 \u00a9 The University of Nottingham Introductory Guidance Within this specification, we have attempted to translate the higher level subjective clinica l guidance given within the Green Book, into the language of the two main Clinical Coding Terminologies currently used in Primary Care, to give a very specific and objective specification that is practical to implement for all GP IT clinical system supplie rs in a consistent way. What we know, is that of the roughly 42,000 diagnostic terms included within Read Version 2, roughly 2,000 of them would expl icitly warrant the administration of the influenza vaccine. A further 2,000 are clinically ambiguous in te rms of whether or not an influenza vaccine should be administered (e.g. \"Congenital malformation of circulatory system, unspecified\"). A perfect informatics sol ution would enable a practice to automatically select patients on the basis of the first group o f terms and then be able to choose which of the patients with purely ambiguous terms warranted vaccination. This does not exist currently however, but is partly mitigate d by the rarity of many of these conditions and their associated clinical coding terms, bearing in mind this process is for monitoring purposes only. Further, there are limitations imposed by some of the clinical system software engines, in terms of the size of the relevant MIQUEST coding string. A small string search (such as C10% excludin g Reaven's syndrome C1098 & C10F8) is easier to handle than a string listing a 100 specific terms scattered across many hierarchies and it can become a rate limiting step. As such, in some hierarchies we have had to adopt a pragmatic solution to defining h ierarchies. The most difficult example of this is in the Pregnancy domain, where we have had to take the unusual step of defining a short pregnancy p referred code list to support \"data entry\" that will be extracted (we shall however extract a slightly wider group). There are two clinical groups in particular (Neurology & Cardiology), that contain large numbers of rarer diagnoses or concep tually ambiguous terms. Within the resource limitations availabl e, these areas are being honed more closely each year. Both of these areas are affected by the presence of clinical conditions of variable severity that are congenital in origin and coded as suc h. The concept of Immune Suppression is also a technically di fficult one to represent. For many patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy or significant radiotherapy, the indication for flu vaccination may be temporary and I feel it may be another ar ea where coding guidance should perhaps be issued. PRIMIS Specification Seasonal_Flu_LQD_ Specification_ V7.0 Page 3 of 53 31st July 2014 \u00a9 The University of Nottingham Within the medication hierarchies, especially immune suppressant drugs there are particular problems. The concept of \"immune suppression by a daily dose of 20mg prednisolone\" cannot be meaningfully represented by the current system suppliers. Again, for the re asons given above, relating to specification complexity, the drug hierarchies have been defined for brevity, but will include drugs that are obsolete or not given in Primary Care. This has no impact on who should, or should not receive influenza vacci natio n under current Primary Care IT systems. This, of course, is fur ther complicated by the use of two clinical terminologies and attempting to ensure they are aligned. An example of the problem here would be the use of the descriptive term \"Brittle Diabetes\" , which is a non -diagnostic term in 5 byte (so not included), but a diagnosis in CTV3 (so is included). The specification has been updated each year to ensure appropriate handling of the biannual READ code updates and obvious anomalies have also been cor rected. For the 2014 -15 season, children aged 2 years, 3 years or 4 years on the 01/09/201 4 will also be vaccinated and they will appear in a numerator/denominator group whether they are in a clinical risk group or not. It should be noted that whilst the vaccination window associated with the Quality and Outcomes Framework programme runs from 1st August, there are no date changes associated with the Vaccine Uptake Monitoring set. Therefore the vaccination window starts at the 1st September 2014. Also the reference dates for pregnancy and age banding within the current influenza season remain as before. Lastly, there is the recognition that this is a Vaccine Uptake Monitoring set and not a patient Recall or Payment set. There are subtle differences, not least in the tolerances. We have had a n example of a formal complaint originating from a practice using a monitoring set, for patient recall purposes, despite the headline branding and caveats.

PRIMIS Specification Seasonal_Flu_LQD_ Specification_ V6.0 Page 52 of 53 31st July 2014 \u00a9 The University of Nottingham Advice on R ead Code Recording Around Pregnancy for Clinical Users This advice has been constructed in the context of attempting to identify pregnant women, in support of the administration and monitoring of Influenza Vaccination programmes from Autumn 2010. The advice, at time of writing, is that women who are pregnant on or after 01/09/13 would form the basis of this at risk subgroup. It is known that the completeness and consistency of history recording using R ead codes concerning pregnancy is highly variable between practices. Further, the nature of the R ead terms applicable to pregnancy related topics include many that are ambiguous when trying to identify if a woman is pregnant or has delivered and are often embedded in mixed hierarchies. This makes construction of a definitive query set almost impossible i n the context of this vaccination programme. To this end, we recommend that any query results are subject to professional review, possibly including any associated midwifery staff, to avoid recalling patients inappropriately. To assist in the process, we are recommending the use of core sets of R ead terms for both Version 2 (5 byte) and CTV3. The actual query set design will however look at a broader set of terms including those known to be more frequently used, but will not include all possible terms. Fo r a small number of terms we have included both the \"operation\" term and the \"clinical finding\" or \"diagnostic term\". It should also be recognised that the concept \"delivered\" also refers to \"miscarriage\" and \"termination of pregnancy\" within this guidanc e. Version 2 (5 byte) terms Patient pregnant 62...
