In Traditional Chinese Medicine, detoxification herbs are only employed when specifically indicated. Toxins in Chinese medicine are considered \"Heat\" generally, and many of the herbs used to clear Heat are bitter, [\"Cold\" herbs](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbal-medicine/). Long-term use of very Cold herbs may disrupt the [Yin-Yang balance of the body](https://agelessherbs.com/yin-yang-theory/) and can damage the [Spleen energetic organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/spleen-qi-deficiency/) if taken for an extended period of time. Often, simply supporting and nourishing organs responsible for eliminating toxins is a much safer and effective way to promote excellent health. For best outcomes using self-care, combine associated [Aroma Acu-Sticks\u00ae](https://agelessherbs.com/acupressure-sticks/) lifestyle practices](https://agelessherbs.com/lifestyle-practices/).

Related Articles: Detoxification in Chinese Medicine According to Patterns of Imbalance It is not uncommon for toxins to affect more than one [energetic organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/organ-systems-of-chinese-medicine/) according to Chinese medicine. Identifying your specific patterns by related symptoms will help you to formulate an effective self-care strategy. Lymphatic Detox in Chinese Medicine The lymphatic system consists of a myriad of delicate vessels found in almost every tissue of the body containing blood vessels. These vessels perform essential functions including the removal of waste products produced from cellular metabolism. The proper function of the [lymphatic system](https://agelessherbs.com/lymphatic-drainage/) is vital for [proper immune system performance](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/wei-qi/). This vital system is often overlooked in detoxification programs. The lymphatic system is often referred to as the 'back alleyway' for trash removal of the body. In Chinese medicine one wants to \"move\" Blood and Qi to effectively break up any congestion of the lymph nodes and to use herbs that help to drain toxins.

As a detoxifying organ, the liver dilutes toxic substances such as metabolic waste, pesticides, and alcohol, with less toxic substances before sending them to be excreted from the kidneys. The fact that the liver is negatively impacted by toxins and alcohol is well recognized in our culture. In [Chinese medicine](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/), a more common imbalance associated with the [Liver energetic ](https://agelessherbs.com/organ-systems/) [organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/organ-systems/) is [Liver Qi frustration, [gynecological diseases](https://agelessherbs.com/pcos-fibroid-endometriosis/), or [stress](https://agelessherbs.com/stress/).

Air conditioning is a recent phenomenon; traditionally, people have had more opportunities to sweat. In our comfortable air conditioned cars, offices, and homes, it is unusual for us to perspire. One of the more efficient ways to eliminate toxins is through a good sweat. While a swift walk or hike would do the job, there are diaphoretic herbs that produce a good sweat also. These are most useful at the onset of a [cold or flu](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/cold-flu/) to release pathogens to the surface; they would include catnip, elder, ginger, and lavender. In Chinese medicine toxins play a big role in the pre-mature [aging of the skin](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/healthy-aging/) and can lessen the tenacity of the dermal layers. Also, \"Heat-toxins\" are the cause of many skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, rashes, and acne marked by redness and inflammation. Additionally, the skin is part of the [Metal Element](https://agelessherbs.com/metal-element/) and [Lung energetic organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/lung-health/) and must be supported while treating skin disorders. Toxins can accumulate in the Blood and [cause Blood Stagnation](https://agelessherbs.com/blood-deficiency-stagnation-in-chinese-medicine/), so one treatment strategy is to [move Blood](https://agelessherbs.com/circulation-stimulation-therapy/) while simultaneously removing Heat.

In western herbalism, kidney herbs typically refer to potent diuretic herbs that will stimulate the kidneys directly such as dandelion. While sometimes useful, over-stimulation of the [Kidney energetic organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/organ-systems/) according to [Chinese medicine](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/) can further damage the system and weaken the kidneys rendering them even less efficient in their ability to eliminate. The kidneys and bladder are vital in the elimination of the toxins from the liver. The Kidney energetic system in Chinese medicine typically suffers from [deficiency rather than excess](https://agelessherbs.com/causes-of-disease/) and since toxins are Yang in nature one would want to nurture Kidney Yin.

While natural laxative herbs such as cascara sagrada and senna are widely available, it is more important that the large intestine is able to perform on its own. There are many herbs that [heal the walls of the intestine](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/digestive-disorders/) such as aloe and marshmallow. Other herbs are vital in restoring the necessary \"Large Intestine [Qi](https://agelessherbs.com/3-treasures/)\" so that the bowels have the energy necessary for peristalsis such as bitter orange. There are actually a multitude of strategies that can help restore [proper bowel movements](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/digestive-disorders/) naturally. TCM often includes oily herbs such as black sesame seed, blood building herbs such as mulberry fruit for dry bowel movements, and bitter herbs such as gentian to stimulate bile flow and begin the myriad of digestive events that must occur for a [healthy digestion](https://agelessherbs.com/digestive-disorders/).

In Chinese medicine the Lung energetic organ system also includes the skin, the largest route of toxin elimination of the body. Related Article: [Lung Energetic Organ System and Breathing Problems](https://agelessherbs.com/lung-health/) Detoxing and Chinese Medicine A well thought out natural herbal body detoxification program can be safe and beneficial. In many cultures spring tonics were utilized as a once-per-year cleansing. In the last 50 years we have been exposed to man made toxins and synthetic pesticides those previous generations never had to cope with. It is now imperative that we utilize these natural herb remedies to realize our full health potential. Increasingly, pharmaceutical medicines are a source of toxicity for us; it is even in our drinking water. Toxins and foreign substances in our tissue can lead to [premature aging](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/healthy-aging/), [disease](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/index/), and [pain](https://agelessherbs.com/chinese-herbs/lower-back-pain/). Natural herbs for detoxing can be beneficial if your body is not independently eliminating toxins efficiently, or you have been exposed to a large amount of toxins; these would include pesticides, air pollution, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cleaners, solvents, alcohol (in large quantities), preservatives, food coloring, heavy metals, chemicals, hair dyes, etc. Detoxification-type herbs must be respected because they are designed to ' [remove fire toxins](https://agelessherbs.com/causes-of-disease/)' from the body according to [Chinese medicine](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/). In order to remove fire toxins, you must utilize very [Cold](https://agelessherbs.com/spleen-qi-deficiency/) herbs typically. Eventually, these energetically Cold herbs can cause a [Yin/Yang imbalance](https://agelessherbs.com/yin-yang-theory/) in the body and can damage the [Spleen energetic organ system](https://agelessherbs.com/spleen-qi-deficiency/). In some cases a 6 week course of detoxification is beneficial before patients begin [tonic herbal therapy](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/tonic-herbs/) Our body does an amazing job of eliminating toxins all by itself. It is only when the body becomes overwhelmed with a large quantity of toxins, or an especially potent toxin, that it is unable to perform the various functions of elimination. The body is wise, and initially attempts to store toxins in fat cells far away from vital [organ systems](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/organ-systems/). This is why people often become ill when losing weight rapidly. The less desirable scenario exists when the toxins circulate in the arteries or are lodged in organ tissue or muscle tissue. Often, toxins act as free radicals; these unstable molecules bounce about and create tissue damage. Some herbs are called \" [blood cleansers](https://agelessherbs.com/tcm/blood-deficiency-stagnation/)\"; this is a bit of a misnomer. Organs are ultimately responsible for cleansing the blood, and there are specific herbs that act to strengthen and/or stimulate those organ systems. Detoxification using herb remedies is an age old practice that was often performed once a year in the spring-time. Back in the day, [foods](https://agelessherbs.com/food-therapy/) that could be stored without refrigeration were on the heavy side with salted meats, grains, but not many fruits and vegetables during winter. It is worth considering increasing the consumption of [organic greens, vegetables, and fruits in your diet](https://agelessherbs.com/food-therapy/) to naturally detox. The traditional winter diet tended to require a detox in spring, and many of these detoxes were in the form of bitter spring green and herbs that were early to emerge after the freezes passed; these would include cleavers, dandelion, chickweed, plantain, and poke (poke weed is toxic if not prepared correctly). These days, we face different detoxification issues. Modern agricultural methods and international shipping opportunities provide produce year round, but at the cost of our consumption of pesticides and the production of more pollution. Therefore, a yearly detox support is still necessary, but for different reasons. An herbal detox would best be performed in a season other than winter as the herbs used to remove \"fire toxins\" tend to be cold in nature. [Ghobadi Pour, M., Mirazi, N., & Seif, A. (2019).
