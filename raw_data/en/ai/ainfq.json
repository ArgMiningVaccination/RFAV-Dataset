Stop scrolling, And lay down your device. The information is coming fast and hard. And it all has energy. Every single line, Every single story, Every single word. So turn it off for a bit, And detox from the information, So you can clear that energy, And replace it with spaciousness, Ease, Love, And presence. So Let's Begin... INFORMATION DETOX GUIDED MEDITATION SCRIPT Begin by breathing in, And pulling your attention inward. Follow the slow rhythm of your breath, As you inhale a little deeper, And exhale a little longer. PAUSE... Settle into comfort, Relaxing your body piece by piece. Softening your face, Dropping your shoulders, Releasing your arms and your legs, Relaxing your back, Opening your chest, And softening your stomach. PAUSE... Breathe deeper into comfort, Deeper into presence, Deeper into you. PAUSE... Imagine those stories dissolving into the air, One by one, Taking their energy with them, As you remain rooted here, Deeply connected to yourself, And what's real in this moment. PAUSE... It is more important to stay whole, And centered, Than it is to stay informed. PAUSE... The news, The posts, The stories, Will all happen with or without you. So detox yourself now, And take away their power, Take away their energy, And instead tune into yours. LONG PAUSE... Feel space opening up inside of you, Ready for love, For calm, For connection. Namaste, Beautiful "}
