Though based in Anacortes, Bellingham, [Portland](https://varioussmallflames.co.uk/tag/portland/) and [New Hampshire](https://varioussmallflames.co.uk/tag/new-hampshire/), and celebrates these links to the Pacific Northwest and beyond. Not least with the name, taken from a track on Mistake, an album by \"mythical\" Anacortes supergroup featuring Bret Lunsford (Beat Happening), Phil Elverum (Mount Eerie/The Microphones), and Karl Blau. This month sees the release of Wild & Free, Megadose's debut full-length album, and the band has unveiled the title track to preview the record. Made in collaboration with Trevor Spencer, who lends Mellotron and keyboard as well as producing, engineering and mixing the track, 'Wild & Free' was recorded in the woods outside Seattle during the early days of the pandemic. The circumstances might have influenced the song's tone and style, the imposed restrictions bringing a love for Washington state and the wider area into sharper relief. 'Wild And Free' \"serves as a sort of anthem for the band,\" Megadose explain. \"True to our PNW roots, we adventure all over the state of Washington and beyond, surfing, mountain biking, camping, and getting into all sorts of trouble. These group adventures are a huge part of our group, and the song is dedicated to that spirit.\" This sense of playfulness is captured with a building rhythm that seizes the listener and drags them along for the ride, and the result is something carefree and momentous. A cathartic reminder of the joys of life. [Bandcamp page](https://mega-dose.bandcamp.com/track/wild-free-single). Cover design and photo by "}
