Classification: OFFICIAL This information can be mad e available in alternative for mats, such as easy read or la rge print, and may be available in alternative languages, upon r equest. Pleas e contact National EPRR team The clinical guidelines for use in major incidents and mass casualty events has been developed following a p eriod of multiple incidents that have presented a range of challenging clinical scenarios such as blast injury, penetrating injury and the use of chemical agents, unlike those seen in day to day practice. This guidance is regularly reviewed and re-issued as new developments based on an ever-increasing evidence base and experience emerge. The intention is that this guidance will be regularly reviewed and re-issued as ne w developments based on an ever-increasing evid ence base and experien ce emerge. Organisations should ensure these guidelines are avai lable to staff and that staff are appropriately trained and confident in responding t o major incidents. The challenge now is to ensure that organisations ensure that these guidelines are available to staff and that staff are appropriately trained and confident in responding to major incidents. Stephen Groves National Head of Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response Kei Wilth lett National Director for Emerge ncy Planning and Incident Respo nse As the S urgeon General for the Defence Medical Services, I am delighted to write the foreword to this very important document that provides clinical guidelines for mass casualty incidents in the civilian setting. This work culminates considerable collaboration between NHS Emergency Planning experts and Defence Medical Services personnel in which we have shared knowledge from both the civilian and military sector. This knowledge has been consolidated into one place in order to provide an authoritative reference for anyone who might be involved in the health sector response to a mass casualty incident. This document is the modern embodiment of the close co-operation between our professions. We have always shared knowledge from the unique environment of military medical practice into the civilian sector to inform our professions how to care for the types of casualties normally seen in conflict. We collaborated together to inform the development of the Emergency Medical Services to respond to Air Raid in the Second World War, this has continued as the NHS developed Major Trauma Centres, and has been evident as we responded to recent terrorist incidents in the U.K. It is very fitting that we publish this document in the year of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the National Health Service. Martin Bricknell Lieutenant GeneralSurgeon General United KingdomForewordIntroduction/1 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 The Clinical Guidelines for use in a Major Incident have been created with the occasional trauma team in mind, for example, for surgeons in a trauma unit who need to treat a deteriorating P2 patient, or a P1 patient who has been conveyed to the trauma unit, during a major incident response. Current protocols and guidance from pre-hospital care and advanced trauma practices have been blended with expert clinical knowledge, military experience gained over many years of managing blast and ballistic injury, NGO/global trauma doctrine and learning points from recent incidents, and made relevant to UK NHS clinical practice. Major trauma centres may have their own protocols and guidance already in place for managing multiple severely injured casualties and these guidelines are not intended to replace these. For the occasional trauma team responder, in a trauma unit or local emergency centre, these guidelines should form the basis of clinical emergency preparedness and serve as an aide memoire during a major incident. It is unusual for an Editor to wish that their work is never used and gathers dust on a shelf someplace, and with regard to a major casualty response, I will always covet this. However, acting as a custodian of knowledge and expertise gained by managing wounded servicemen and victims of terrorist events, I hope that these guidelines will be perpetually updated and constantly used to support ongoing learning and training, and to set global standards in good quality casualty care. Justine Lee Ed itor Specialty Doctor in Major Trauma, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham Clinical Reference Group Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response I t is important that these guidelines are practical, self explanatory, relevant to the users and updated regularly. Individual guidelines can be (and will be) updated independently. You can check that you are using the most up to date version of any guideline by checking the version number on the latest index page at the front or the guidelines or on the web www.eprronline.gov.uk/ourwork All feedback and suggestions, from current and future contributors will be gratefully received.

Several smaller incidents may combine, or be geographically located, so as to require a mass casualty response to be enacted due to the large number of simultaneous casualties. For specialist services such as burns, the trigger for activation of their mass casualty arrangements will be lower due to the limited availability of resource for incident response. Adult P1 P2 Major incident awareness A major trauma centre (MTC) should expect to receive predominantly (P1) patients, a Trauma Unit (TU) should expect to recieve (P2) patients and other medical facilities will be assigned (P3) patients. However, a mix of casualties should be planned for, as there will be little (if any) ability to transfer patients between sites for the first 24 hours. To assist a regional response to a mass casualty event, a pre-determined patient dispersal plan (casualty regulation) should be used, showing where casualties will be dispersed to by the ambulance service and how many casualties each hospital has pre-agreed to accept in the first hour. The local emergency services (ambulance/police/fire) are usually the first to notice unusual activity in their control rooms and will notify their incident management director on call. They will decide if escalation of the incident is required and if this is a potential or actual major incident. If there is a surge of casualties arriving in ED without warning , or if there is news (via social media or word of mouth) of an emerging incident, then the ED consultant on call/senior nurse on duty will contact the medical director or clinical site manager (see local MI protocol) and decide whether to self declare and start escalation of the hospital major incident plan. Your hospital's emergency planning, preparedness, response and resilience to a major incidentMajor incident awareness A major incident is any occurrence that presents serious threat to the health of the community or causes such numbers or types of casualties, as to require special arrangements to be implemented. For the NHS this will include any event defined as an \"emergency\" as in section 6.4 of NHS England Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response Framework. Under Section 1 of the CCA 2004 an \"emergency\" means (a) an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom;(b) an event or situation which threatens serious damage to the environment of a place in the United Kingdom; (c) war or terrorism, which threatens serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom.MOI/1 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Casualty in defensive position (crouched and lying down) Clinical presentation of casualtyx y z xy zxOrigin of gunfire - three shots fired Figure shows same person, and how wound tracts look in a clinical settingNote: four wound tracts A Gunshot involving face/nec k - see Speciality Overv iew Gunshot not involving face/neck = standard airway management. B Standard care. C Standard care. The bullet path will not respect anatomical boundaries so look for multicavity/multi organ injury . Small entry and exit wounds may be associated with significant internal injury. Be guided by the clinical condition - 'what you see may not be what you get' D Immediate wound managemen t as per IMED Entry and exit wounds do have different characteristics but practically, can be very difficult to distinguish (and it is rarely important during initial care). E The actual path taken by the bullet within the casualty will depend on how they were orientated when struck (standing, sitting, crouching, running) - which is often not the position the casualty is examined in by responding clinicians. Bullets that ricochet off an intermediate surface or pass through intermediate targets (bags, clothes) may become unstable, hit side face on (rather than with the tip) and produce greater immediate energy transfer. KEY POINTS Bullets that fragment may lead to multiple wound tracts across different body (or anatomical) regions. Some tissues tolerate deformity from temporary cavitation better than others ie skeletal muscle versus bone.Investigations The pattern of bone fragments and bullet debris may show the direction of travel of the bullet within the casualty. Some bullets break up (' fragment') within the casualty producing multiple wound tracts. CT is used to screen for bullet fragments prior to MRI (if needed). Small entry and exit wounds may mask catastrophic internal damageBallistic injury Mechanism of Injury Ballistic injury 7 8 Retained bullets and fragme nts are likely to have steel components and be affected and moved by the MRI magnetic field. Imaging is covered in ED Resus 4IntroductionBullets cause injury by two main mechanisms: 1. Tissue being crushed and lacerated along the bullet path. 2. Tissue being stretched and displaced by the temporarycavity. The clinical effects will depend on the body area and underlying organs hit by the bullet. Immediate casualty management follows the standard CABC approach and is dictated by the casualty's clinical condition. Mechanism of injuryCatastrophic haemorrhage Non-compressible? Does patient need to go direct to theatre? Compressible? Apply direct pressure/junctional techniques/ tourniquets. See immediate wound management IMEDDiagrams below demonstrate the average path of bullets. However it must be appreciated that bullets will tumble, fragment and produce fragments that are not in the average path. 8MOI/1 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Ammunition A round of ammunition consists of two main parts: Bullet (the part that leaves the gun and strikes the target). Cartridge case that contains primer and propellant. The cartridge is ejected from the gun (a 'spent case' or 'brass') and may be present at the incident scene. Ammunition is often described by width and length: A '9\u00d719mm' has a bullet head 9mm in width and a brass case 19mm long. This describes ammunition often fired from a handgun/pistol. A '7.62\u00d739mm' has a bullet 7.62mm wide and a case 39mm long. The longer case, compared to the 9\u00d719mm ammunition, allows for more propellant to be packed into the case. This gives the bullet more kinetic energy when fired. Ammunition can also be described using imperial measurements for the bullet width - usually fractions of an inch ( eg .223) or using both imperial and metric measurements (eg .223in/5.56mm). Pistol 9\u00d719mm ammunition The temporary cavity is smaller than that associated with rifle ammunition. AK47 7.62\u00d739mm ammunition The bullet flies straight initially then becomes unstable, creating a large temporary cavity associated with tissue stretching and tearing. Police rifle .223 Remington exposed tipThis is an example of a bullet designed to flatten out ('expand') soon after impacting on a target, so that energy is transferred rapidly and the temporary cavity is large early in the bullet's flight. The bullet is more likely to stay in the body of the first person shot and not go through and hit someone else.Bullet effects When a bullet impacts a target, energy is transferred to the target. The effects depend on: 1. the material properties of the target 2. the bullet design This is illustrated using the figures below depicting bullet impacts into 500\u00d7250\u00d7250mm 10% gelatine blocks (derived from high speed digital photography of actual impacts). When shot, 10% gelatine behaves in a similar way to muscle tissue. The temporary cavity is also shown superimposed on the outline of a human torso to illustrate possible wounding effects. The energy from the bullet impact creates a 'temporary cavity' within gelatine or muscle lasting for fractions of a second. This collapses down around a much smaller permanent tract created by the bullet. If the bullet becomes unstable within the gelatine or muscle and begins to tumble, it will present its side face to the material rather than its tip. In this way more energy is transferred, due to a greater contact surface area between the bullet and tissue, and the cavity will be larger. Ballistic injuryMechanism of Injury Ballistic injury Graphics used with kind permission from Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, Nov 2017MOI/2 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 A Have a high index of suspicion for airway compromise if blast and casualty were in a confined space (bus/underground/metro) Flash burns indicate a high risk of blast lung B Blast Lung is the most common fatal injury among initial survivors Low initial O2 Sats may indicate primary blast lung injury Rib fractures, pneumothorax and lung contusions are commonly associated with a blast Have a low threshold for chest decompression/chest drain Consider early intubation and lung protective ventilation from outset and through to ICU care C NeckPenetrating neck injuries are common and often fatal Chest Great vessel/aortic injury Pericardial tamponade Myocardial contusions - may lead to cardiac arrhythmias Abdomen Blunt abdominal injury caused by secondary and tertiary blast mechanisms can cause significant bleeding and late bowel perforation, even if the abdominal wall is not breached Liver/splenic rupture Air embolism leading to mesenteric ischaemia Pelvis Significant bleeding can occur with open SI joints The wider the pubic symphysis, the greater the transfusion requirement Manage initially with pelvic binder and rapid proximal control Further resuscitation and surgery may be required Traumatic amputation Check tourniquet(s) have been applied Prepare to exchange for pneumatic tourniquet(s) Avoid crystalloids during resuscitation (worsens coagulopathy)Blast injury Mechanism of Injury Blast injury Catastrophic haemorrhage Does patient have a traumatic amputation or is this an isolated injury? Look for other associated injuries: Blast Thorax - High risk of catastrophic great vessel and aortic disruption - seek early cardiothoracic opinion. Blast Lung - early intubation, lung protective ventilation from outset and through to ICU care. Blast Abdomen - risk of significant intra-abdominal bleeding and late bowel perforation, even if abdominal wall is not breached. Blast Pelvis - High mortality rate from exsanguination, especially if SI joints are open (of relevance for landmines, IEDs and floor-based devices). Apply pelvic binder, gain proximal control and resuscitate. Surgery may be required at any time to assist resuscitation. CT imaging is desirable as soon as possible, if the patient is stable enough. 5 D EHave a high index of suspicio n for blast lung (incidence increases when casualty in an enclosed s pace) see Speciality Overview 3 Introduction Aggressive resuscitation is required in close range survivors. Look for a occult injuries and monitor for evolving injuries.

Fragmentation weapons increase the risk of fatality especially over longer distance in the open field - explosion outside, victim outside. Distance from blastPrimary blast injuries common in fatalities, but rare in survivors as overpressure effects reduce rapidly with increasing distance from the device. Close range injuries - mutilating injuries common, traumatic amputations, open head, chest, abdominal injuries with exposed contents. Further away - secondary and tertiary blast injuries predominate and survival much more likely, with increasing distance fragments are less numerous, and less serious unless vital structures damaged. Aggressive resuscitation in survivors is requiredBlast location Enclosed space: explosion inside, victim inside (bus bombs, pub bombings etc.) Complex blast environment with increased effects of overpressure due to reflection and amplification. Primary blast injuries especially blast lung common in both fatalities or survivors. Effects may be localised if protection offered by walls or furniture. Explosion outside - victim inside building or vehicle. Low risk of primary blast injury. Victim also protected from fragments. Tertiary blast injuries predominate, with civilian pattern fractures. Safest environment, unless building collapse occurs. Suicide bombers Main effects as above and related to type of explosive device and environment. Secondary fragments from bomber or other victim can occur - especially bone fragments. Risk of infection (e.g. blood borne viruses) from biological implantation.5 Classifications of blast injury Primary - injury resulting in direct tissue damage from the shock wave hitting the body. Secondary - injury from fragments ('shrapnel') from a device or the environment. Tertiary - injury from displacement of the body (thrown against a wall/up in the air). Quaternary - other types of injury (for example: burns, inhalation injuries etc). Quinary - sequelae and late complications, for example fungal infection if major tissue damage.MOI/3 Updated: 08/01/2020 Standard care Do not use Suxamethonium for RSI - risk of hyperkalaemia/death B Lung Protective Ventilation for all ventilated patients from ED onwards Rib fractures Early multimodal analgesia Surgical stabilisation of flail segment if more than four ribs involved C Risk of : CV collapse on release from entrapment Risk of internal bleeding from organ contusions High risk of pelvic fracture with associated haemorrhage Consider need for pelvic binder If prolonged extrication, patient may have had IV fluids at scene Continue adequate fluid resuscitation Patient is at risk of rhabdomyolysis Use blood if haemorrhagic shock is present, then give crystalloid solutions to ensure adequate urine output Do not apply tourniquet to a crushed extremity unless there is catastrophic haemorrhage D Cranial trauma Associated with poor outcome seek early neurosurgical advice Penetrating eye injuries Are easily missed inspect the globes (if unable to do so, refer to ophthalmology) Multiple fractures are common Look for occult nerve/tendon damage small child/frail older person with co-morbidities are at increased risk of death due to crush syndrome E Treat hypothermia if present KEY POINTS Consider multiple other injuries : burns fragmentation injuries blast lung multi-fragmentary fractures subdural haematoma eye injuries tympanic membrane rupture - steroids may salvage sensorineural hearing loss Have a high index of suspicion for crush syndrome Rhabdomyolysis: Check creatine kinase Check urine myoglobin Give crystalloid to establish good urinary output if rhabdomyoylsis suspected or confirmedCrush injury Summary Patients may have multiple injuries affecting different tissues and organs and are at risk of crush syndrome. In explosions, additional injury types such as blast and fragment injury should also be considered. Prolonged entrapment may occur. Extrication after a long period of entrapment is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular collapse; may lead to worsened renal failure or cardiac arrest. 1 34 5 67 2 23 4 5 6 71MOI/3 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Mechanism of Injury Crush injuryCrush injury and crush syndromePre-hospital, the patient may have had the following management: Intravenous fluids may have been given prior to releasing the crushed body to prevent systemic reperfusion injury. This is especially important in cases of prolonged crush (>4 hours), however may occur after as little as 1 hour entrapment. A tourniquet may have been used on the affected limb - slow release of tourniquet is required to prevent distallimb reperfusion injury. Observe all crush casualties, even those who look well Patients are at risk of: Reperfusion Injury Acute hypovolaemia with metabolic abnormalities Release of toxins from necrotic tissues into the circulation may cause renal failure May occur when a trapped limb or casualty is suddenly released Observe for: cardiac arrhythmias (may be lethal) myoglobinuria Hypotension Casualties may require considerable fluid replacement in the first 24 hours (third space losses) Observe for: Compartment syndrome (consider prophylactic fasciotomies) Signs of renal failure ED Resus Initiate (or continue) IV hydration\u2014up to 1.5 L/hour Renal Failure Rhabdomyolysis releases myoglobin, potassium, phosphorous, and creatine kinase into the circulation Myoglobinuria may result in renal tubular necrosis if untreated Release of electrolytes from ischaemic muscles causes metabolic abnormalities ED Resus Patient may require IV fluids and mannitol to maintain diuresis of at least 30mls/hr, to prevent renal failure ITU Patient may require haemodialysis Patients with acute renal failure may require up to one to two months of dialysis treatment; however, in the absence of any infection, patients are likely to regain normal kidney function.Metabolic abnormalities Hypocalcaemia: Calcium flows into muscle cells through leaky membranes Hyperkalemia: Potassium from ischaemic muscle Metabolic acidosis: arrhythmias, including cardiac arrest; metabolic acidosis may exacerbate this situation ED Resus Consider correcting Hyperkalemia/Hypocalcemia If required, give calcium gluconate 10% 10mls or calcium 10% 5mls IV over two minutes Sodium bicarbonate 1mg/kg IV slow push Regular insulin required.

The dose is titrated to effect based on the reversal of bradycardia (endpoint > 90), bronchospasm and secretions. High doses (up to 1000mg) have been used in the past especially in the absence of effective oxime therapy. Alternatives to atropine include hyoscine.Oxime therapy: Oximes are enzyme reactivators and should be given as soon as possible to P1 patients. The first choice of oxime in the UK is pralidoxime and has good efficacy for sarin and VX. An alternative oxime is obidoxime and may be used if tabun or delayed enzyme reactivation is suspected especially with a requirement for high atropine doses or failure to reverse nicotinic effects.Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines are used as anti-convulsants and are also neuroprotective. Ventilation strategy: This is similar to the asthma ventilation strategy due to high airway pressures, and atropinisation can be monitored by reversal of bronchospasm and capnography normalisation.Nerve agents cause the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

It is designed to be used in times of SURGE in order to identify patients in need of a life-saving intervention and suggests the intervention(s) required. Early secondary assessment from senior clinicians is recommended to mitigate for initial over-prioritization. Note: This guideline is not designed for pre-hospital triage.

Casualties arriving at the hospital may not have undergone a pre-hospital triage process. Under normal circumstances, casualties from a major incident will have undergone a pre-hospital triage process to determine their priority for treatment. On arrival at hospital, they will be met by individual and designated treatment teams. The aim of this process is to rapidly identify those casualties in need of life-saving interventions. It can be completed by providers with all levels of experience in under 30 seconds. The physiological assessments within the process are evidence-based (adapted from the MPTT-24) 2 and have the greatest sensitivity for identifying those in need of life-saving interventions within both the civilian and military environments. As a consequence of this, a greater proportion of casualties will be categorised as \"High Priority\" including a number of those who do not require life-saving interventions. At the earliest opportunity, and within a permissive setting, early secondary assessment by a senior decision-maker is required to review those categorised as \"High Priority\". References: 1.

However the objective of triage in a mass casualty situation is to do the greatest good for the greatest number. JumpSTART \u00a9 is a system designed specifically for triaging children in disaster settings. Infants are seen first, followed by anyone who is or appears to be a child aged 12 or less. Allows paediatric casualties to be assessed based on physiology and should not prioritise paediatric casualties above sicker adult casualties Provides an objective framework when decision making may be stressful and emotive Emergency Department Emergency Department triage (paediatric <12 years) 08/01/2020 v2.0 YES * In the JumpSTART \u00a9system, infants are evaluated first, using the entire JumpSTART\u00a9 algorithm. Other children who cannot walk on their own (but are carried to the treatment area) are evaluated next. NO YESNO Breathing? Position upper airway Palpable pulse? Five rescue breathsPriority 1 Priority 1 Priority 1 Priority 1 Priority 1Dead Dead Priority 2Secondary triage* Adult Triage tool ED Tria ge 1Primary triage Typically performed at the scene of the incident Helps to prioritise patients for evacuation/transport Can occur at a hospital Main differences between adult and paediatric triage 1. In children, if positioning the airway does not restart ventilation, then give a trial of ventilation, as this may restart spontaneous ventilation. In adults, there is no trial of ventilation and the adult casualty is tagged expectant or dead. 2. In children, only peripheral pulses should be used to assess circulation. 3. In children, AVPU is used to assess mental status, not ability to follow commands. Non-ambulatory children include: infants (who can't walk yet) children with developmental delays children with acute injuries or chronic conditions prior to the incident that prevented them from walkingThe JumpSTART\u00a9 paediatric triage MCI triage tool (usually shortened to JumpSTART\u00a9) is a variation of the simple triage and rapid treatment (START) triage system. Both systems are used to sort patients into categories at mass casualty incidents (MCIs). However, JumpSTART \u00a9 was designed specifically for triaging children in disaster settings. Though JumpSTART\u00a9 was developed for use in children from infancy to age 8, where age is not immediately obvious, it is used in any patient who appears to be a child (patients who appear to be young adults are triaged using START or other adult triage systems).Severely ill/injured but treatable. Able to be saved with relatively quick treatment and transport eg severe bleeding, sepsis, open chest or abdominal wounds, severe respiratory distress, emotionally uncontrollable. Injured/ill and unable to walk on their own; potentially serious injuries/illnesses but stable enough to wait a short while for medical treatment eg burns with no respiratory distress, spinal injuries, moderate blood loss, conscious with a head injury. Minor injuries/illnesses that can wait for a longer period of time for treatment eg minor fractures, minor bleeding or minor lacerations. Dead or obviously dying. May have signs of life but injuries are incompatible with survival eg cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest with a pulse*, massive head injury. It can be emotionally challenging to tag a child as expectant/deceased. Resist the tendency to assign a higher triage category to paediatric patients just because they are children. Using an objective triage tool during a major incident can provide emotional support for staff forced to make these decisions for children. * In children, typically respiratory failure precedes circulatory failure. If a child is apnoeic but has a pulse, a brief trial of ventilations, may 'jumpstart' their respirations (trial: five rescue breaths)Secondary triage Performed to re-evaluate a patient after primary triage has been completed Typically done once the patient arrives in hospital Can also be done at an alternative care site, casualty clearing station or if time on scene is prolongedEmergency department triage (paediatric <12 years) Priority 1 Priority 2 Priority 3 Priority 4Immediate Delayed MinorExpectantEmergency Department Emergency Department Emergency department outcomes, discharges and follow up advice in a major incidentEmergency department outcomes, discharges and follow up advice in a major incident In a major incident, decisions regarding the sickest patients need to made quickly and decisively, so that these patients reach their treatment destination first time and without delay.Less severely injured patients may be managed and discharged from ED with further management or follow up plans in place, if their wounds and physiological status allows this, to protect theatre and bed capacity for other more urgent cases.

They provide oversight of the department, keep informed of the pre-hospital situation and assist with patient movements between resus, imaging, theatres, critical care and the wards. The Theatre Co-ordinator will also need to keep the surgeon commander informed for theatre space, surgical kit availability, theatre staffing/skill mix etc. They will also keep Hospital control informed of capacity in their areas, after consultation with their area Controller. e.g. Resus Senior Nurse Co-ordinator Co-ordinates the nursing response in ED Ensures that a scribe and a suitable nurse are available for each trauma team/resus bay Informs hospital control of staffing needs and patient numbers Liaises with Site manager/Bed manager when destination identified for patient Responsible for crowd control (staff and relatives) in Resus Trauma team roles in a major incidentED Resus Trauma team roles in a major incidentMajor Incident Trauma TeamAs part of the Major Incident STANDBY and DECLARED action, theatres, critical care, blood bank, surgical specialities and imaging will have also been informed and making ready to receive casualties.

Pre-hospital management focuses primarily on the prevention of further blood loss and the active management of hypothermia and hypoperfusion to prevent Trauma Induced Coagulopathy (TIC). Pre-hospital Tranexamic Acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic, should be given within three hours of injury (ideally within the first hour) Minimal non-haematological fluids should be used in order to maintain a central pulse ED Resus Once a major incident has been declared: Request one MHP1/MTP1/Shock pack for each P1 casualty expected Consider basing transfusion staff in ED (transfusion practitioners/medical staff) to support multiple ED transfusions A porter should be assigned to the ED blood fridge Theatres Consider basing transfusion staff in theatres to support multiple ongoing transfusions NHS Blood Transfusion Service (NHSBT) is also responsible for holding CBRN ( ie Nerve Agent) antidote pods MOI Once a patient has reached hospital, care should be as close to the gold standard as possible ED Resus Catastrophic haemorrhage and massive transfusion pathway in a major incident Significant bleeding HR>110 Systolic BP <90 No Radial pulse Ongoing resuscitation Standard CABC approach Secure IV Access Ensure patient has a hospital number and ID band Take blood samples for: baseline blood tests (FBC, U&E, G&S) clotting screen gas (ABG) ROTEM/TEG/VHA/Haemostatic testing if available MASSIVE TRANSFUSION PATHWAYSTOP THE BLEEDING Apply dressing +/- topical haemostat/gauze and direct pressure to any obviously bleeding wound Apply pneumatic tourniquet proximal to the bleed (limb) Is a pelvic binder indicated?

MHP/Shock Packs vary between hospitals - be familiar with local practice. \u00ceRBCs and Platelets should be RhD and K compatible to prevent the future development of antibiodies, however Group O RhD and K Negative red cells may be in short supply and should be prioritised for children and women under the age of 50. \u00ceBest practice requires two separate blood samples to confirm the ABO and RhD groups. Blood Planning Recent reviews of MCEs recommend planning for a red cell demand of 3 RBC units per 24 hours, for each casualty admitted to the hospital (usually P1 and P2s). An early estimate for more severely injured casualties admitted to trauma centres, i.e. P1 casualties with massive haemorrhage, is nearer 6 units of RBC in the first 24 hours. Many of these patients may also require plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate as guided by Major Haemorrhage protocols. Hospital Transfusion Teams should be aware of their organisation's pre-determined first hour capability (P1 and P2) in order to inform their EPRR planning. Use of blood products, coagulation studies and VTE \u00ceSerial APTT and or ROTEM/TEGs should be done, before and after resuscitation and every 30-60 minutes depending on severity of haemorrhage, to guide use of blood products. \u00ceCryoprecipitate is the standard source of fibrinogen in the UK. Consider if Fibrinogen falls below 1.5g/l. 2 pools (from five donors each), will increase fibrinogen in an adult by 1g/dl approx. \u00ceIf FFP or Cryoprecipitate is required urgently for a patient, before the blood group is known, then Group A should be issued (adults). In massive haemorrhage, the risk of clinically significant haemolysis is likely to be very low. \u00ceThromboprophylaxis should be given after major haemorrhage and should be started as soon as possible after bleeding ceases. There is some evidence from obstetrics that those who bleed excessively have a higher rate of VTE. Blood donations during/after a major incident One of the immediate responses of the public is to offer to donate blood. The challenge for blood services is how to harness that spirit of public altruism that manifests after a disaster, without wasting any blood. In 2001 after the World Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks, 475000 units of blood were collected, but only 258 used. Please advise any prospective donors that their blood is likely to be needed in the future and that they should register as a blood donor and respond to the blood donation service's requests for blood.ED Resus/2B Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 ED Resus haemorrhage and massive transfusion pathway in a major incidentTHIS PAGE HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKED Resus/3 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 MI senior clinical decision making Dual senior decision making is preferred Simplified to five clinical outcomes in a major incident Reassess casualties often Consider palliation or upgrading care if the casualties condition changes or if the situation changes (for example delays to transfer) Using POC thromboelastography (TEG/ROTEM) to guide resuscitation is the gold standard Consider Interventional Radiology if capability is available locally (without need to transfer) and if theatre space is limited FAST not yet proven to be reliable in trauma however may assist prioritisation of patient to imaging or theatre Operating theatre Recovery/critical care or wardEmergency Department Triage PalliationConsideration of situation or resources may drive the decision to palliate earlier than would normally be considered in a single casualty situation Conventional workup and treatment For active treatment No immediately life or limb threatening injury Obvious clinical indication for theatre Occult injury Responder Non-responder Not controlled Controlled External bleeding Full clinical assessment including imagingImagingClinical review by Senior Decison Maker(s) (ideally a dual senior Surgeon and Anaesthetist combination)1 2 GIVE TXA HEAD INJURY OR NEURO AXIAL INJURYPatient needs surgical assessment ED Resus MI senior clinical decision making ONGOING DAMAGE CONTROL RESUSCITATION 3 4 5ED Resus/3 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 ED Resus MI senior clinical decision making THIS PAGE HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKED Resus/4 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Head KEY POINTS CT whole body Low threshold to image in mass events and in blast (blast radius can be large) In blast injuries, CT whole body means head to ankles CT traumagram means head to lesser trochanters (Bastion protocol) Intraoperative CT can be done after haemorrhage control is gained Repeat, delayed imaging at 5-7 days should be considered if solid organ injury Department planning Consider senior consultant in ED to coordinate imaging flow Use USS in ED to triage to CT Two consultants per CT scanner The first issues an acute report, the second completes a full reportMI imaging (including CT whole body) Imaging is vital for triaging patients, helping to plan surgery, for assessing urgency of surgery and to help guide ongoing surgery.

However, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and simple contusions often occur without any external signs of injuryMI neurotrauma (brain injuries) The principal aim is to prevent or reduce secondary brain injury. Ideally a patient with a brain injury would be transferred to a neurosurgical centre, however in a major incident this may not be possible, or other injuries may dictate that a patient should be cared for at another specialist centre. These guidelines are to assist in recognising which patients need to be transferred for surgery (once transfers are possible) and how to optimise their care prior to that transfer. Most common blast brain injuries are diffuse axonal injury (DAI), cerebral contusions and subdural haemorrhage.IMED/2 Updated: MI neurotrauma (brain injuries)MI neurotrauma (brain injuries) Classification and significance of brain injuries Extradural (epidural) haematomas (EDH) Small EDHs can be managed most will require neurosurgical evacuation Subdural haematomas (SDH) Usually associated with significant primary brain injury, and therefore outcome is usually worse than EDHs May be due to an acute or chronic bleed Acute bleeds must be recognised, as they may cause mass effect/midline shift and are likely to need neurosurgical intervention Subarachnoid haemorrhage Unlikely to require surgical treatment and can be managed with good supportive care. Will need to have a non-urgent CT Angio to exclude contusions and haematomas may coalesce and evolve. Tends to peak 48-72 hours post injury. Intracranial pressure may need to be monitored Oedema and associated rise in ICP may make these minor cerebral injuries life threatening and difficult to treat Diffuse injuries Full spectrum of injuries from mild concussion through to severe diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Little scope for surgical intervention and these patients are usually managed in regional severe brain injury centres Signs of basal skull fractures CSF rhinorrhea Use BM stix/urine dipsticks to test for Glucose (present in CSF but not in mucus) Give Pneumovax if unvaccinated Bilateral peri-orbital haematomas (Raccoon/Panda eyes) haemorrhage otorrhea May be due to ruptured tympanic membrane (?CSF leak) or blood from an external ear laceration Bruising over the mastoid(s) (Battle's Sign)Types of brain injury Primary brain injury If patient requires surgery, it is unlikely that any medical intervention will replace surgical management. However, prevention of secondary injury is essential. Secondary brain injuryHypoxia Protect airway, high flow oxygen with re-breathe mask during resuscitation A single episode of hypotension between injury and resuscitation doubles mortality and morbidity Ischaemia Raised intracranial pressure Poor cerebral perfusion secondary to pressure: pressure This reduces perfusion and causes ischaemia Normal ICP is 5-15mmHg. When ICP>20mmHg, contact the neurosurgical centre for advice on escalation of treatment Acidosis Coagulopathy Injury at cellular level causes lactic acid production and coagulopathy: reduced cerebral blood flow results in accumulation and further cellular damage Abnormal blood glucose Lack of glucose in the presence of oxygen results in neuronal necrosis; this is even more significant in hypoxia Others Including cytotoxic cascade, vasospasm Associated with fractures of the anterior cranial fossa (present in 50-60% of cases) May take 1-3 days to develop May take 24-48 hours to develop May indicate blood tracking from the orbital cavityIMED/3A Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Injury management in ED MI control MI surgical/proximal haemorrhage control If catastrophic haemorrhage cannot be stemmed by direct pressure or a tourniquet, so called \"uncompressible haemorrhage\", it is essential to obtain control by surgical access. This is normally most rapidly achieved by exposing vessels proximal to the immediate zone of injury. To control retrograde filling, vessels distal to the injury should also be exposed. In the profoundly hypovolaemic patient a palpable pulse may not always be present so finding the vessels relies on knowledge of anatomical landmarks. REBOA may have a role but currently should be viewed as experimental and used as part of a trial. Interventional radiology is not recommended for genuine catastrophic haemorrhage in an unstable patient. K EY POINTS Use extensile incisions Incision can incorporate wound line if required.

If necessary, divide the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein to improve access. The carotid tree and internal jugular vein can be accessed in Zones 2 and 3 by an oblique longitudinal incision along the anterior edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle . The sternal head can be divided as can omohyoid and the facial vein. Preserve the hypoglossal nerve. With good retraction it is possible to reach the base of the skull via a distal extension of this incision. Thorax: All large vessels in the thorax can be accessed via a 4th intercostal space clamshell incision . A 4th intercostal space anterolateral thoracotomy alone can be used for diagnosis, relief of cardiac tamponade , internal cardiac massage and control of the descending thoracic aorta . It does not give easy access to other vessels. The left subclavian artery is more easily accessed via a median sternotomy. Abdomen: Probable high abdominal injuries and peri-arrest situations may be addressed more quickly by control of the descending thoracic aorta via a 4th space anterolateral thoracotomy. All other approaches to the aorta and common iliacs should be via a midline laparotomy. For large vessel injury rapid control is achieved by supra- coeliac compression immediately below the diaphragm or infra-renal compression at the root of the mesentery - depending on the level of the injury. For solid organ injury rapid control is achieved by packing. Further dissection is dictated by the exact location of the vascular injury or organ involved. Access to the main vessels is achieved by entry into the retroperitoneum either directly at the root of the mesentery or by medial visceral rotation from the left or right.Upper limb: Control of the subclavian vessels as they cross the first rib and the most proximal part of the axillary artery can be achieved via a medial supraclavicular incision running parallel to the clavicle. This requires division of the clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid and then the anterior scalene muscle with preservation of the phrenic nerve. The trunks of the brachial plexus are in close proximity. The majority of the axillary artery is accessed through a lateral horizontal infraclavicular incision. The fibres of pectoralis major should be split horizontally and then the deeper pectoralis minor muscle divided through its tendon. This then reveals the axillary vessels in a fat-pad. The cords of the brachial plexus are in close proximity. It is rare to need to violate the clavicle but if access to the exact portion of the axillary artery beneath it is required it can be divided with a saw in its mid portion. The most distal part of the axillary artery and upper brachial artery are best approached via an axillary incision and extending longitudinally down the arm in the medial bicipital grove. If necessary, infraclavicular and bicipital grove incisions can be joined with the vessels exposed by dividing the pectoralis major tendon at its humeral insertion. Control below the upper part of the brachial artery is achieved with a tourniquet (mid-humerus). Pelvis: Rapid control by pelvic packing can be achieved by an extraperitoneal approach via a lower midline incision or by direct packing via a laparotomy. Common and internal iliac vessels are most rapidly control by direct dissection via a laparotomy. Lower limb: External iliac vessels can be controlled by direct dissection via a laparotomy or by an extraperitoneal approach by laterally extending a longitudinal groin incision and dividing the inguinal ligament lateral to the deep ring. The common femoral artery to beyond its bifurcation and the lower part of the external iliac vessels are accessed via a longitudinal groin incision centred over the mid-inguinal point. Control distal to the upper part of the superficial femoral artery is achieved with a tourniquet (distal to proximal third of femur).Injury management in ED MI surgical/proximal heamorrhage control MI surgical/proximal haemorrhage control The following approaches are for rapid access to achieve life saving vascular control.

In a mass casualty context, surgery should be complete within 1 hour. F ragments from blast and other ballistic projectiles do not respect anatomical boundaries: Clam-shell thoracotomy is the incision of choice. Be prepared to operate on junctional area (eg. neck) and enter adjacent body cavities e.g. laparotomy if there is evidence of co-existing abdominal injury Surgery should be physiological not anatomical (for non-anatomic resection use gastrointestinal staplers, and consider pulmonary tractotomy for penetrating lung injury before attempting lobar resection). KEY POINTS Select appropriately-sized chest drains, thumb: Infant: 12-16F Child: 16-24F Adult: 24 -32F For every patient with chest injury: ensure effective pain relief and chest physiotherapy Early antibiotics are essential; however, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is not often required beyond chest drain insertion or the duration of the primary operation see Speciality Overview A A dual lumen tube is not always necessary - choose an anaesthetist with thoracicexperience if possible B Majority of patients with chest injury only require chest tube placement Consider lung protective ventilation if intubated Reduced tidal volume Peak pressures minimised High FiO 2 for first 8 - 24 hours then reduce and use lowest FiO 2 Consider 'permissive hypercapnoea' but also consider 'permissive Resuscitate to normovolaemia Avoid fluid over-resuscitation Early urinary catheter is advised, as UO is a sensitive measure of end organ perfusion and resuscitation status of patient D Potential for fragment and air embolisation (from IPPV) E Examine the back and posterior chest Patient may not have had log roll prior to theatresIndications for damage control thoracotomy: For resuscitation in a peri-arrest patient , (or loss of cardiac output in ED) Consider REBOA, if the source of blood loss is extra-thoracic to extend resuscitation time For massive air-leak compromising ventilation Outcome after pre-hospital cardiac arrest is likely to be very poor and in the context of a MCI, other casualties may have higher priority Delayed thoracic surgery is indicated for: Persistent bleeding Persistent air leak Thoracic empyema Other complications or concern: liaise closely with your regional thoracic surgical team Thoracotomy does not have to be done 'routinely' to retrieve fragments following ballistic injury Injury management in ED MI Thoraci c trauma 2Catastrophic haemorrhage Immediate return from chest tube of approx. 1.5 litres in an unstable patient On-going blood loss of approximately 200 ml/hr 1 23 12 3IMED/5 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Injury management in ED MI Thoraci c traumaMI thoracic trauma Prepare for a damage control thoracotomy : Plan for a damage control operation (with planned re-look when the patient is stable) Place patient supine with arms abducted (\"star\"/cruciform position) For unilateral injury, a bolster bag (e.g. pressure infusor bag) behind the patient's chest on the injured side help but DO NOT formally turn the patient on their side as endo-bronchial bleeding from an injured lung can contaminate the (dependent) un-injured lung and turn a crisis into a disaster. Double-lumen tubes are not often necessary Prep patients' chest to knees; once prepped, patient can be draped appropriately and covered to maintain temperature. Make a clamshell incision: limited left thoracotomy gives insufficient access. Always open the pericardium to exclude or treat haemopericardium. Remember to control the internal mammary vessels on the underside of the sternum; above and below your incision. Non-anatomic resection of damaged lung can be done with gastrointestinal staplers. Pulmonary tractotomy should be done when possible to control bleeding and/or air leak from penetrating pulmonary injury rather than attempting major resection. Remember to check the diaphragms and think of abdominal injury. Use the vacuum-pack technique for temporary thoracic closure, attaching the dressing to wall suction at 120mmHg. Patients should be intubated and ventilated after trauma thoracotomy and managed in an ICU setting. \"SITREP\" Maintain intra-operative dialogue with your anaesthetic team. You must be aware of: physiological status including inotrope requirements transfusion situation how long you have been operating Plan to take the patient back to theatre at 24-48 hours with a thoracic surgeon; liaise with your regional Network coordinators who can arrange for a specialist surgeon to come to you.IMED/6 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 MI abdominal trauma Do the MINIMUM necessary surgery to save life: think DAMAGE CONTROL. Remember: Fragments from blast and other ballistic projectiles do not respect anatomical boundaries. Look for 'paired' injuries in hollow organs Be prepared to enter adjacent body cavities e.g. you may need to do a thoractomy after exploratory laparotomy. If the source of on-going bleeding is from the chest, blood may be coming through a diaphragmatic injury. K EY POINTS Have \"two consultant\" operating where possible Make a full midline incision The priorities are: First: stop the bleeding Then: control contamination Do not do definitive intestinal repairs or stoma formation Make a temporary abdominal closure and plan for re-look at 24-48 hours Get the patient off the table as soon as possible: at 1 hour you should be finished or finishing Maintain a dialogue between surgery and anaesthesia and don't get 'task fixated' on complex reconstructive surgery A Standard Care B Lower rib fractures from blunt trauma may cause significant hepatic or splenic injuries D Resuscitative laparotomy +/- thoracotomy may form part of the primary survey, in the seriously injured patient. Primary and secondary survey must be completed once the patient is stabilised Serial abdominal examinations are required in suspected abdominal trauma Regular blood gases to monitor condition Actively look for missed injuries A full MDT review of imaging and a top-to-toe survey is mandatory E Examine the back and posterior chest Patient may not have had a complete primary/ secondary survey.

Pre-laparotomy Antibiotics are essential prior to your incision; however, you do not need to continue surgical antibiotic prophylaxis beyond the duration of the primary laparotomy. The WHO Checklist should be used. \"Two consultant\" operating is very helpful, if staff are available. If possible; have a senior surgeon in the department moving between operating rooms to maintain oversight of departmental activity, to act as point of contact for incident commanders and to act as arbiter for difficult surgical decisions (such as transfer to palliation). Patient positioning Place patient supine with arms abducted (crucifix position). Prep patient's: chest & abdomen to knees; once prepped, patient can be draped appropriately and covered to maintain temperature. The operation Make a full midline incision: xiphisternum to pubis. Firstly, aim for haemorrhage control . In a very unstable patient - your assistant should digitally occlude the aorta at the hiatus while the surgeon evacuates blood and clot and then finds the source of blood loss and controls it. Next goal is control of contamination : do not attempt definitive intestinal surgery (i.e. with repair, resection & anastomosis or formation of stoma). If there are multiple bowel injuries in one segment, or destructive injury, use stapling devices to resect damaged bowel and leave the bowel ends 'stapled in discontinuity' in the abdomen. Minor injuries can be simply over-sewn with sutures. Do a thorough exploration once you have control of bleeding and contamination . Beware the following areas: Diaphragm, left and right High on stomach around OGJ Lesser sac Mesenteric border of intestine Retroperitoneal colon Think about extraperitoneal rectal injury; on table sigmoidoscopy (flexi if possible) may help you make the diagnosis. In a patient with continuing instability despite apparent control in the abdomen, think about adjacent cavities: chest / pericardium . A pericardiotomy can be done via your laparotomy incision. Look for 'paired' injuries in hollow organs; think about the retroperitoneum, be prepared to operate on junctional area and enter adjacent body cavities e.g. thoractomy after laparotomy if the source of on-going bleeding is from the chest and coming though diaphragmatic injury. Un-paired holes in the bowel are a marker of missed injury. Temporary abdominal closure Use the vacuum-pack technique for temporary abdominal closure, attaching the dressing to wall suction at 120mmHg. Patients can be woken and extubated with this form of temporary abdominal closure but ensure the dressing is properly applied, as there is an increased risk of evisceration in an awake patient compared to a patient intubated in an ICU setting. Planned re-look Plan to take the patient back to theatre at 24-48 hours. At first re-look laparotomy: do a thorough exploration of the entire abdomen & pelvis to exclude missed injury. Over-sewn intestinal injuries should be taken down and re-done. There is always a 'zone of injury' with penetrating injury and so the bowel should be debrided to healthy, vascularized bowel and then re-repaired . The extent of the debridement will vary according to the energy of the injurious mechanism (minimal for knife or low energy fragment, more extensive for GSW or destructive fragment) if (at first re-look) the patient is relatively stable, restoration of bowel continuity by anastomosis is a real option with avoidance of stoma in both small and large bowel injury in many cases. Formation of a colostomy may be appropriate in the most severely injured, with massive transfusion, on-going inotrope requirement etc. Form a defunctioning colostomy for patients with penetrating rectal injury ; repair the injury if you can access it and manually remove faeces from rectum and washout. The 'damage control' technique for rectal injury is as above, but don't mature the colostomy - divide colon with stapling device and leave ends inside. Imaging CT is not mandatory; rely on your clinical indications for laparotomy ; reserving scarce CT scan resources for patients who need them (patients can always be scanned later in their clinical course if necessary). Thoughtful clinical examination and surgical judgement is required; remember the abdomen has a posterior aspect, examine the back thoroughly during the log roll, do a PR. Look carefully for penetrating injury. Catheterise early , blood in the urinary tract is a helpful physical sign. Evisceration of bowel and or omentum is relatively common after blast injury. If a patient has had CT : remember blast-injured patients may have pneumo-peritoneum without visceral injury ; look for corroboration (clinical status or associated evidence of organ injury on CT-such as free fluid) before operating.MI abdominal traumaInjury management in ED MI Abdominal traumaIMED/7 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Injury management in ED MI transfuser 1 - Pelvic injury Apply pelvic binder, reassess and x-ray Aim to keep binder time < 6 hours Could the pelvic bleed be managed by IR?

Are there any obvious wounds that require the patient to go immediately to theatre without further assessment? Uncontrollable haemorrhage is probably the only indication. Are there any wounds that require immediate attention to prevent deterioration? Any exposed viscera/brain? Place a saline soaked gauze on these, do not use antiseptic solutions. In all types of blast and ballistic wounding, a CT 'whole body' scan should be performed.Catastrophic haemorrhage Junctional and intra-cavity ongoing bleeding is an indication for surgery (or IR).

All wounds must be examined so all dressings must be removed. Do this in a methodical and thoughtful manner. Don't forget the back. Consider doing it with a surgeon present to avoid unnecessary re-looks. Particularly relevant in complex wounds and for vascularity issues. Consider doing sequential areas rather than the whole body in a single go. If there is a risk of significant haemorrhage when removing a dressing, consider doing under tourniquet control. Note the general state of the patient in terms of clothing (torn? shredded? burnt?) and dirt (dust? soil? soot?). Non- specific but helps with the overall assessment. A patient covered in dirt has a higher risk of dirty wounds. Are there any patterns to the wounding? Aim to get as much information as possible without exploring the wound. By simple observation it is normally possible to ascertain: Is there obvious contamination with foreign bodies? Is it obvious that the deep fascia has been breached? Is bone exposed? Then, formally examine for vascular, nerve and tendon deficits. Probing the wound with instruments or fingers provides no further useful information and is potentially harmful. Documentation and planning Once the wounds have been fully assessed the findings must be documented. Take quality photographs if it is at all possible. Have pre-agreed (in the plan!) who has responsibility for documenting the forensic description of the wounds (precise anatomical location, exact size and structures involved) because it must be done at some-point. Probably best done by the surgical team in theatres supplementing the CT findings. The findings must be presented to the relevant clinical coordinator for planning of next steps. This will generate a priority list for timings to theatre and dictate where the patient will be held until it is their turn. If there is any penetration of a body cavity or deep fascia, exposed bone or open fractures or alteration in normal function there is requirement for the wound to be formally explored. This should be done in an operating theatre. Timing of wound management For patients likely to go to theatre within the next 12 hours: Place a saline soaked swab on the wound and secure with an outer dressing. Do not be tempted to irrigate the wound. There is no evidence to support the use of antiseptic solutions. In significant mass casualty situations, patients with soft tissue wounds may not get to theatre in the first 12 hours. In this case there is still no clear evidence to support irrigation in ED or the ward even with such a delay to formal debridement. The presence of grossly contaminated wounds should be part of the surgical triage assessment, and these patients prioritised for theatre before 12 hours where possible. Administration of systemic antibiotics as early as possible has been shown to reduce the proliferation of contaminating bacteria and so does buy time. Application of a saline soaked swab will suffice. For those with superficial wounds (where there is no evidence of damage to deeper or important structures and the degree of contamination is such that formal debridement in theatre is not considered necessary) These wounds can be cleaned according to usual practices under appropriate analgesia. No ballistic wounds should be primarily closed. Provision must be made for follow up of the patient to ensure appropriate delayed closure occurs.Non-surgical control of haemorrhage General oozing from the wound can be controlled with a pressure dressing and/or elevation. There are several types of topical haemostatic agents available. These are primarily designed for pre-hospital use to mitigate for a lack of surgical capability where tourniquets and pressure dressings prove inadequate, such as in junctional areas. Once within a hospital, where surgeons and operating theatres are available, the approach to continuously bleeding wounds should be formal surgical control. The use of haemostatic dressings within hospital should be limited to extreme situations only. If the patient has a tourniquet in place either from pre- hospital or applied on arrival during the primary survey this should be evaluated before the wound is addressed. An inflated tourniquet makes a patient a priority for theatre. If the tourniquet is a simple windlass type, as is common for pre-hospital use, this should be replaced by a pneumatic tourniquet, as soon as is practicable. This can be placed proximal to the windlass but not inflated initially nor applied too tightly such that it restricts venous outflow. The windlass can then be released and the wound observed. If there is no significant haemorrhage then the pneumatic tourniquet does not need to be inflated immediately but should remain in place as a precaution or for use during debridement. At this point an assessment of distal vascularity can be made. If on releasing the windlass tourniquet there is significant bleeding, then inflate the pneumatic tourniquet and formal surgical vascular control should be obtained as a priority. If the initial tourniquet has been on for significantly more than two hours, discussions about managing the patient's general condition, overall distal viability and potential need for fasciotomies should be had, before the tourniquet is released.IMED/9 Updated: 13/01/2020 v2.0 MI universal fasciotomies These universal fasciotomies have been designed to decompress compartments and allow adequate vascular access , without compromising future soft tissue reconstruction . \u00ceU se extensile incisions \u00ceI ncision can incorporate wound line as required \u00ceA im to achieve proximal/ distal control outside of any haematoma or zone of injury Injury management in ED MI universal fasciotomies Two incision, four compartment fasciotomy for the lower leg Use a skin marker to draw the surface markings of the medial and anterior borders of the tibia.

The evidence on which these protocols are based, is rapidly maturing and a pragmatic approach has been taken as evidence related to the rescue of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) associated with noise and blast exposure evolves. Treatment options are severely time limited. For adults and children, with symptoms or proven hearing loss, hearing tests should be performed by the Regional Coordinating Audiology Department (RCAD). In the presence of a severe hearing loss however, early assessment and treatment is imperative and it is perfectly appropriate to test earlier. For children, tests need to be age appropriate, however, standard 'adult' Pure Tone Audiometry can often be performed with children above the age of five. This should be considered if the numbers injured place pressure on paediatric audiology services or the location dictates and there is a wish to keep parents and children together. If hearing tests are normal, no immediate action is required. If tinnitus persists, then other therapies may be indicated, as per local ENT guidance . I f abnormalities are detected, results should be passed on URGENTLY to the Regional Coordinating ENT Department (RCENTD) for assessment. If the loss is purely conductive which may be due to; blood in the external auditory canal tympanic membrane perforation ossicular discontinuity No immediate action is needed. Keep the ear dry. Patients can be followed up routinely in outpatients at an interval appropriate to their pathology. If hearing loss is mixed or purely sensorineural steroids may be beneficial. In the mass casualty scenario, where resources available to deliver intra tympanic membrane injections (ITSI) may be compromised: Patients can be prescribed oral Prednisolone, 1mg per Kg to a max of 60mgs OD, for 7 days with PPI cover for 14 days, after appropriate consideration of contraindications and consent. After one week if there is no improvement in the sensorineural component of the loss intratympanic steroids should be considered as there is evidence of superiority when compared to oral steroids for hearing salvage. Updated Advice (2017) FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN - remember to TITRATE STEROID DOSES to weight. Be meticulous to explain the possible side effects. The information given on this, and other treatment options, must be documented for all patients. Have a joint consultation if possible, ENT with a paeds consultant present is the ideal. Intra tympanic injection of steroid may give good effect, reducing the relative risk of complications associated with systemic steroid use. This should be considered if a patient, especially a child, is sedated or has a GA for any reason. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Patients who have a conductive hearing loss can be helped in the immediate period with a bone conduction aid e.g. in order to complete informed consent, or simply to reduce the injured patients' sense of isolation. Your audiologist may have some ideas such as; \"Alice band\" secured aids (used pre BAHA). Bone conduction aids that stick to the mastoid.In the presence of associated polytrauma, oral/IV steroids may be contraindicated, however, intratympanic steroids may be considered particularly if the patient is having operative procedures during which the intratympanic steroids can be also be concurrently administered. F or children, oral Prednisolone should be considered in the absence of contraindications and after a joint paediatric/ENT consultation (to ensure all are aware of possible side effects). For both adults and children gastric protection should be considered and usually given. *AAT and steroid use Intratympanic steroids should be considered as an alternative to oral steroids at first presentation or as salvage after one week of oral steroids. If a mixed loss persists to treat the sensorineural part in the presence of a perforated ear drum topical steroids given regularly rather than an ITSI may be appropriate. Consider steroid use (ITSI or topical drops if perforation present) if there is a strong suspicion patient has sensorineural loss but unable to subjectively test e.g. intubated patient with severe scalp burns. In severe trauma, where objective evidence of SNHL or high suspicion exists but relative contraindications to systemic steroids are present, ITSI should be considered. If vision is lost, this consideration should be given a high priority.SO/1 skull fracture No antibiotics required Give Pneumovax (if sinus/auditory canal breached) Penetrating eye injury iv + Clindamycin 450mg tds iv CNS Ceftriaxone 500mg tds iv #All weeks duration Penetrating chest trauma Co-amoxiclav 1.2g tds iv (if qds iv #One to two weeks, depending on progress or presence of intercostal drains Open fracture limb/hands Co-amoxiclav 1.2g tds qds iv #Until soft tissue cover or 72 hours, whichever is soonest (BOAST4 guidelines) Penetrating soft tissue injury Co-amoxiclav 1.2g tds iv first surgical debridement/washout KEY POINTS Bacterial infection in blast or ballistic injury, is the same as other wounds but don't just treat the microbiology report. Consider if this is colonisation or infection? Close liaison with a microbiologist within the multidisciplinary team is essential. Common things occur commonly, but be on alert for an unusual clinical picture. Tell the lab about the unexpected findings or unusual clinical picture, as diagnostic labs are set up to look for common pathogens and may overlook others. Be aware or suspicious of wounds with evolving (unexpected) necrosis.Antimicrobial prophylaxis IntroductionBlast wounds are extensive and contaminated (and will remain so even after extensive debridement, or will rapidly become recolonised); whereas gunshot wounds (GSW) are relatively clean . Give your microbiologist as much information as possible. How was the injury sustained? What was the environment in which it was obtained? Any organic contamination or water exposure? Keep to simple measures and antibiotics Recognise your patient will have a huge inflammatory response and it may not be due to an infection.

Casualties with PBLI will develop varying degrees of respiratory distress with impaired gas exchange. They may require supportive care in a high dependency or intensive care environment and up to 80% will require mechanical ventilation. The combination of blast injury and haemorrhagic shock is particularly life threatening and requires rapid and aggressive treatment. Specialty overview Blast lung in a major incident B Patient may present with: mild to moderate respiratory distress Pneumothorax/pneumatoceles Broncho-pleural fistula in severe cases CT chest to exclude pneumohaemothorax N o specific therapy for PBLI currently exists and patients should be ventilated as per current best practice for acute lung injury. Intensive Care Management Ventilate in accordance with current best practice Early CPAP at 5cm H2O, once pneumothoraces are drained Moderate PEEP levels on case by case basis if broncho-pleural fistula Use pAPRV and/or ECCO2R (local experience and resources permitting) Euvolaemic volume status Expect a good recovery C Hypotension may be due to myocardial impairment and decreased SVR Consider vasopressor use to avoid excess administration of IV fluids A May have haemoptysis KEY POINTS Casualty identification If asymptomatic at two hours, patient will not need mechanical ventilation. If asymptomatic at six hours, significant PBLI is unlikely to occur. Risk factors Explosion in confined space Close proximity to explosionHas patient been exposed to: Toxic industrial chemical exposure ( eg Chlorine/ Phosgene / Cyanide). Other toxic or smoke exposure. Tympanic membrane rupture is not a sensitive or specific risk factor for PBLI. Catastrophic haemorrhage Catastrophic haemorrhage may result from a massive haemothorax Needs prompt recognition, haemostatic resuscitation and damage control surgery Figure 1 Figure 2 SO/3 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Specialty overview Blast lung in a major incidentBlast lung in a major incident Background Primary blast injury syndrome is a life threatening, multi- system disease, of which primary blast lung injury (PBLI) is normally the predominant injury. PBLI is defined as \"radiological and clinical evidence of acute lung injury occurring within 12 hours of exposure and not due to secondary or tertiary injury\", and results from exposure to a supersonic explosive shockwave (Figure 1). Solid organs and the long bones may also be injured by the shockwave, however in the lung, significant damage manifests as alveolar and parenchymal rupture, haemorrhage, lung laceration, and pneumothoraces. Immediate fatalities are the result of venous air embolism. The exponential decline in shock wave energy means that in an open air explosion, just a matter of a few metres can make the difference between suffering a fatal blast injury and suffering virtually no injury at all. However, when an explosion occurs in a confined space such as buildings or trains, the energy within the shock wave does not dissipate so readily, but self-propagates and augments itself in a chaotic manner. The stand-off distance in a confined-space explosive event is as a result less important and the risk of injury much greater. Presentation and diagnosis P BLI was seen in 63% and 54% of the critically injured casualties suffered in the Madrid and London train bombings, respectively. Respiratory compromise and possibly haemoptysis, are early signs of PBLI. The absence of respiratory compromise 2 hours after injury suggests that the need mechanical ventilation due to PBLI alone is unlikely. Patients who are asymptomatic 6 hours after exposure are unlikely to develop clinically important disease. Tympanic membrane rupture is poorly correlated with PBLI but non the less should be sought for and identified. The possibility of co-existing toxic lung injury (with cyanide or phosgene for example), gastric aspiration and pulmonary contusion from blunt injury should be considered. Casualties with PBLI require management in a high-dependency or critical care environment and the majority will require mechanical ventilation.CT imaging is the imaging of choice: Clearly demonstrates the distribution and extent of alveolar haemorrhage and parenchymal haemorrhage. Better demonstrates pneumatoceles and pneumothoraces which may not be apparent with plain film radiography. Figure 2 overleaf , is an example of a CT scan in a patient with severe PBLI, shortly after injury Plain film radiography may demonstrate: Contusions, which may be denser on the side of the incident shock wave Characteristic 'bats-wing' distribution of consolidation may be seen, although this is not typical ( Figure 1 overleaf ) Medical management Casualties with PBLI require management in a high-dependency or critical care environment and the majority will require mechanical ventilation. The combination of blast injury and haemorrhagic shock is particularly life threatening and such patients should be triaged and prioritised accordingly. No specific therapy exists for the management of PBLI though this is an active area of research. Tranexamic Acid and recombinant factor VIIa have been studied but demonstrated no benefit. Hepatitis B vaccination must be considered when fragmentation injury with human tissue has occurred. There is no current guidance regarding the value of prophylaxis against HIV infection in such circumstances and so a case by case consideration should be made locally. Computerised modelling studies (unpublished at the time of writing) have looked at the potential benefit of early ambient-air CPAP and at optimal modes of mechanical ventilation ( Figure 3 ). These studies demonstrate the potential for significant improvements in oxygenation and reduction in respiratory rate with the application of 5 cmH 2O CPAP on air within an hour of injury. Use of oxygen enriched air augments this effect. They also suggest that airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and in particular ultra-protective tidal volume ventilation (facilitated by extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2R)) may offer significant physiological benefits to the patient. ECCO2R requires large bore venous access and full anticoagulation with heparin and so has obvious limitations in the trauma population. Figure 2.The results of computerised modelling studies.

Cardiac output and heart rate can often increase by 150-200%. The patient will also typically have a hyperglycaemic insulin resistant state and often require insulin supplementation. Manage in a thermoneutral environment. Early excision of deep burns where possible. Signs and symptoms; hyperdynamic circulation, increased body temperature, catabolism and inefficient energy substrate cycling. Infection Burns patients are vulnerable to infection in the early stages due to loss of the protective skin layer and immunosuppression secondary to major trauma The massive SIRS response in major burns makes diagnosis of sepsis challenging. A high index of suspicion is essential Isolation in a single cubicle and an ante-room is the gold standard Stringent infection control precautions cannot be over emphasised. All clinical staff should follow hospital standards for hand washing and wear aprons and gloves as a minimumHyperpyrexia When core temperature greater than 39\u00b0C Patients with major burns are often hyperthermic. A short period of very high temperature can cause significant morbidity Temperatures of 41.6 to 42\u00b0C can cause irreversible cell damage in as little as 45 minutes Management of core temperature >39\u00b0C Septic screen, check U&E, CK Antipyretics Open burn wound dressings (discuss with burn surgeon first if possible) Consider ice packs to axilla and groin Refrigerate NG/NG feed and flush Management of core temperature >40\u00b0C for more than 6 consecutive hours As above (>39\u00b0C) plus Consider immediate active cooling e.g. CVVHDF, oesophageal cooling, coolguard. Management of core temperature >41\u00b0C for more than 2 consecutive hours As above (>40\u00b0C) plus Consider additional active cooling methods e.g. CVVHDF, oesophageal cooling, coolguard. Stop active cooling measures when the core temperature reaches 38.5\u00b0C. Core temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C can be considered normal, secondary to the massive SIRS response to thermal injury.

These guidelines have been created for clinicians forced to disturb items of potential evidential importance by treating a patient. Make at least one record of any items with potential evidential significance; Photograph and/or Clinical Sketch (with scale) and/or written notes/description Avoid contamination between patients (crime scenes), or by introducing material of your own (DNA, fibres etc) Major crime scenes are complex events, and admissions to hospital tend to occur at their outset before a clear investigative structure has been established. Dealing with multiple casualties from a single suspicious incident If you are dealing with multiple casualties from the same suspicious incident, be aware of the risks of cross-contamination between them. If possible, request that staff only care for one of the casualties. If not, ensure you change all of your protective equipment between the two casualties and document the change. If patient is under suspicion, they should be cared for by a separate team in a separate area if possibleInjuries The recording of injuries before treatment can provide vital evidence. Use in hospital photographers/DIY cameras/apps. Police photographers are only likely to record the injury once it has been stitched, glued or dressed/bandaged. Take scaled photographs of an injury; one wide 'locating shot' showing where the injury is, and another detailed shot showing its extent is ideal. Clinical sketches and clear written notes are also very valuable. Clothing and footwear Fibre, DNA and blood pattern evidence on clothing, and damage to clothing, can assist in reconstructing the nature and sequence of an attack. When removing/cutting clothing avoid cutting through existing cuts and tears in the fabric. Avoid putting multiple items with wet bloodstains in a single plastic bag. Package items in individual plastic bags before grouping them together in a single plastic bag. Do not clean seized footwear. When removing footwear from a patient, avoid obvious bloodstains/tears/cuts when cutting through the uppers. For example, cut through the posterior part of a shoe upper to preserve evidence on the front upper. Drugs If you find a substance on a patient that you believe might be a form of drug: Avoid direct contact with the substance. Handle it sparingly with a gloved hand. Store the substance in a plastic bag somewhere secure. When describing a substance in notes, exhibit labels or in statements, describe what it looks like but do not guess what it may be. Weapons Edged weapons (knives etc) If an edged weapon is found on a patient, be mindful that it might harbour evidence on both the handle and the blade. Consider your safety; handle the weapon minimally and with care. Handle sparingly with gloved hands. Move the knife by handling uncommon points of contact, such as the edges of the hilt or the pommel (base). Place into a clean rigid tub, rather than a plastic bag. Firearms If you recover what you believe to be a firearm, do not touch or handle it. Call the police to inspect the weapon and make it safe. Ammunition components (bullets, shot or wadding) Rounds (a bullet with a metal cartridge containing propellant) or shotgun cartridges are potentially live. You should inform the police immediately. A bullet or shot removed from a suspected gunshot wound will have been expended and is no longer live. These can be packaged individually in a small plastic pot lined with a plastic bag to stop it rattling. Shotgun shot can be stored collectively. *These guidelines have been created for clinicians forced to disturb items of potential evidential importance by treating a patient.They are not intended to act as a professional reference for forensic collection SO/6 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Specialty overview Forensic awareness in a major incidentForensic awareness in a major incident Exhibits An exhibit is any item, image or document entered into the police chain of custody (see below). An item isn't covered by the rules of evidence before it is seized, but you should still take sensible precautions to optimise any potential value as evidence by: Recording the appearance, location and nature of an item of interest. This will avoid confusion about the nature and origin of an item that later becomes an exhibit. Exhibits will be packaged and stored according to the evidence types associated with it by the police/forensic teams. Allow police to collect discarded clothing/items. For example, a shirt with bloodstaining may be packaged in a tamper evident bag and frozen for DNA analysis. If you are likely to handle multiple exhibits from the same suspicious incident, be aware of the risk of cross-contamination by wearing two pairs of nitrile gloves and discarding the outer pair after handling each item.Communication Police/Forensic teams present at the hospital may not understand your clinical priorities, or know what items the victim/suspect had on their person. Assist the police by noting: The number, position and description of injuries What clothing and footwear has been removed from the victim/suspect How these removed items have been packaged and where they are currently stored Make good clear clinical notes, with time and place, as these may be used as evidence in any subsequent inquiry.These guidelines have been created for clinicians forced to disturb items of potential evidential importance by treating a patient.

Opioids eg morphine Morphine is familiar to most trauma clinicians. Multiple routes available but in acute situation is best given by intravenous bolus: 1-5 mg as bolus and then additional 1-2 mg doses , every 2-5 minutes, titrated to effect. Relatively large doses may be required in young athletic casualties and analgesia is slow in onset. Fentanyl is a faster acting alternative. 50 micrograms i/v as a bolus and repeat doses of 25-50 micrograms every 2-5 minutes. Degree of sedation more closely related to acute overdose than respiratory rate Accidental overdose requires intravenous naloxone. Take one ampoule (0.4 mgs) and dilute to 8 mls with water for injection. Inject 1 ml (0.05 mgs) and repeat until sedation reversed and respiratory rate 8 Effect is short acting - observe casualty closely II. Weak opioids eg Tramadol, Codeine T ramadol Synthetic in pain 50-100 mgs QDS po. Start at 50 mgs if patient is opiate naive III. Non-opioids N SAIDs Avoid with acute haemorrhage/coagulopathy or critical illness. Side effects more likely in elderly patients. Ibuprofen (200 -400 mgs tds, po, pr) or diclofenac commonly used. Paracetamol 1g iv/po/pr QDS (500 mgs if body weight less than 50 kgs) Few contraindications. Will have some opioid sparing effect.Adjuncts - Co-analgesics A.

It provides information on how you may expect to feel in the days and months ahead, and to help you understand and have more control over your experience.Coping with stress following a major incident Where to find more help? Contact your GP or NHS111 about possible symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post traumatic disorder, visit NHS Choices - www.NHS.uk or call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90Do: Take time out to get sufficient sleep (your normal amount), r est and relax, and eat r egularly and healthily . Tell people what you need. T alk to people you trust. Y ou don' t have to tell everyone everything but telling nobody anything is often unhelpful. T ake car e at home or when driving or riding - accidents ar e mor e common after a traumatic or str essful event. Try to reduce outside demands on you and don' t take on extra r esponsibilities for the time being. Make time to go to a place wher e you feel safe and calmly go over what happened in your mind. Don' t for ce yourself to do this if the feelings are too str ong at the moment.How can I help myself or others to overcome these difficulties? Don't: Bottle up these feelings. Think whether it would be helpful to talk about them with somebody you trust. The memories may not disappear straight away . Get embarrassed by your feelings and thoughts, or those of others. They ar e normal r eactions to a very str essful event. A void people you trust.More information on post trauma reactions www.rcpsych.ac.uk/ healthadvice/problemsdisorders/posttraumaticstressdisorder.aspx www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Post-traumatic- stress-disorder/Pages/Treatment.aspxSpecialty overview Psychosocial support for a major incident SO/11 Updated: 08/01/2020 v1.0 In addition, if a child has witnessed or experienced a traumatic event it is quite natural for them to be stressed. They may be very upset and/or frightened. This should not usually last beyond four weeks. If symptoms of being very upset continue beyond four weeks, this may indicate Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and it is important to seek help for your child. These are typical reactions after a traumatic event: Nightmar es. Memories or pictur es of the event unexpectedly popping into their mind. Feeling as if it is actually happening again. Playing or drawing about the event time and time again. Not wanting to think or talk about the event. A voiding anything that might remind them of the event. Getting angry or upset mor e easily. Not being able to concentrate. Not being able to sleep. Being mor e jumpy and being on the lookout for danger. Becoming mor e clingy with parents or carers. Physical complaints such as stomach aches or headaches. T emporarily losing abilities (e.g. feeding and toileting). Pr oblems at school. How to help your child: Try to keep things as normal as possible: keeping to your usual r outine and doing normal activities as much as you can, will help your child feel safer mor e quickly . Be available to talk to your child as and when they ar e r eady. If it is difficult for you to do this, ask a trusted adult such as a family member or teacher to help. Try to help your child understand what has happened by giving a truthful explanation that is appr opriate for their age. This may help r educe feelings of confusion, anger , sadness and fear . It can also help corr ect misunderstandings that might, for example, lead the child to feel that they ar e to blame. They can also help reassur e the child that although bad things can happen, they don' t need to be scar ed all the time. In the event of a death, particularly a traumatic one, it can be difficult to accept the r eality of what has happened. It is important to be patient, simple and honest in r esponse to questions about a death. Some childr en, for example, will seem to accept a death but then r epeatedly ask when that person is coming back. It is important to be patient and clear when dealing with these questions: for example, it is better to say \"John has died\" than \"John has gone on a jour ney\". What to look for: Childr en experiencing PTSD might show that they think differently either about themselves or other people. They might: Blame themselves or show lower ed self-esteem. Describe thinking that they ar e a bad person or talk about thoughts of deserving bad things to happen to them. Show less trust in other people and be less able to experience a sense of safety . Experience overwhelming feelings in the form of shame, sadness and fear . A void situations that they fear could incr ease their emotional r esponse - i.e. might make them feel mor e frightened, thr eatened, ashamed or reminded of the event. What to do: If you have any concerns about your child, it is important to seek help via your GP . There are some very effective treatments including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for children and young people experiencing the effects of trauma.You might need help if you have been experiencing any of the following reactions for several weeks and there is no sign of them getting better: Y ou want to talk about what happened and feel you don' t have anyone to shar e your feelings with. Y ou find that you are easily startled and agitated. You experience vivid images of what you saw and have intense emotional r eactions to them. Y ou have disturbed sleep, disturbing thoughts pr eventing you sleeping or dr eams and nightmares. Y ou ar e experiencing overwhelming emotions that you feel unable to cope with or experience changes in mood for no obvious r eason. Y ou experience tiredness, loss of memory , palpitations (rapid heartbeat), dizziness, shaking, aching muscles, nausea (feeling sick) and diarrhoea, loss of concentration, br eathing difficulties or a choking feeling in your thr oat and chest. Y ou feel emotionally numb. Y our relationships seem to be suffering since the incident. Y ou ar e worried about your alcohol or drug use since the incident. Your performance at work has suf fered since the incident. Someone who you are close to tells you they ar e concer ned about you.Specialty overview Psychosocial support for staff after a major incident Major incident response Early intervention Additional support Specialist supportInitial support Getting advice Monitoring and sign posting TreatmentMajor Incident Organisation acknowledges staff effortsCommunity activities and public support External professional support (eg. Mind BlueLight infoline)Peer and family support Occupational Health primary healthcareNHS 111GP Primary Care Support Specialist Mental Health ServicesIAPT (Improving accesss to psychological therapies)Screen and Treat TRiM service (Trauma risk management ) or equivalent SO/12 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Psychosocial support for staff after a major incident 'Psychosocial' refers to the emotional, cognitive, social and physical experiences of people in the context of particular social and physical environments. Mental healthcare refers to delivering biomedical interventions from which people with disorders may benefit. After a major incident, staff who attended to support as first responders and those who worked to provide subsequent care in hospital settings, are at risk of developing mental health disorders. Most people involved in a major incident are likely to suffer short-term effects. In most cases, distress is transient and not associated with dysfunction or indicative of developing mental health disorders. Some people's distress may last longer and be more incapacitating, for example where there are social factors maintaining their distress (e.g. separation from family, loss of home and possessions, social isolation). A small proportion of people may require access to specialist mental healthcare. However, it is important to access the right help at the right time. Immediately following a traumatic event, personal, brief, single session interventions that focus on the particular event, should not be routine practice and do not need to be organised. Instead, follow Phase 1 advice below. Depending on the nature of events, around 70% or more of all people who are affected by major incidents are psychosocially resilient, despite their distress. Distress reduces in severity if they receive support they perceive as adequate and intervening early can reduce the risks of people developing disorders later. The majority of staff who respond cope well and recover after emergencies if social support is available from relatives, friends and colleagues. Employers should support staff by ensuring that they are well briefed, well led and offered effective social and peer support. Recent research shows that events encountered in emergency departments affect the psychosocial wellbeing of staff, and the cumulative effects may be negative and long-lasting. The following phased strategy is advised to support all those involved in a major incident, to prevent mental disorders and to identify those who may need specialist mental health services.Specialty overview Psychosocial support for staff after a major incidentPsychosocial support for staff after a major incident Phase 1 Initial support #Launched in reaction to the event Psychological first aid (PFA) and peer support Includes the employer's leadership response to a major incident by communicating key messages of acknowledgement, self-care and support services, internal and external to the organisation Access to advice and support as necessary through existing universal services (community, primary care/GP and specialist services) Intervene using low level interventions such as peer support leaving biomedical mental healthcare for people who need it Phase 2 Getting advice #Weeks two to four Psychosocial support Aim to manage distress, but an emphasis on maintaining social connectedness and people receiving social support Involves listening, advice and support With their consent, some staff may be referred to a programme that offers monitoring over a longer period of time and access to screening Phase 3 Additional support/getting help #From two weeks onwards Continuing psychosocial supportMonitoring staff at risk via occupational healthThis may include referring people to: Primary care The TRiM service or equivalent (if available) Specially created services to identify people who may need continuing support beyond four weeks The IAPT service for more intensive psychosocial care Phase 4 Specialist support/getting more help #When symptoms are still present between four and twelve weeks after an event People with a history of the following may be at higher risk of developing a mental disorder than the general population: Staff injured in the event or during the response Exposure to high-severity of trauma Close proximity to event Dissociative response during the event Significant (pre- or post-event) personal trauma, including developmental trauma and previous history of a mental disorder Personal or significant family psychiatric history Perceived absence of social support network Substance misuse Traumatic bereavement If people are distressed or have symptoms of a mental disorder after 4 weeks and any of these risk factors are present, an early referral to a specialist mental health service may be advised.Advice available from: Coping with Stress following a major incident (NHS Guidance) assets.publishing.service.gov. uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/ attachment_data/file/617321/nhs_trauma_ leaflet.pdf Traumatic uk/stress-management-policy MIND mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/coping- with-traumatic-events Advice available from: Programme mind.org.uk/ news-campaigns/campaigns/bluelight NHS 111 (to signpost to an appropriate service) Advice available from: Primary Care/own GP (for referral to IAPT) Improving access to Psychological Therapy Services (IAPT) for specialist PTSD support england.nhs.uk/mental-health/adults/iapt Mind Blue Light Programme mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/campaigns/bluelight Advice available from: Primary care/own GP (for referral to IAPT) Improving access Psychological Therapy Services (IAPT) england.nhs.uk/mental- health/adults/iaptSO/12 Updated: 08/01/2020 v2.0 Specialty overview Rehabilitation co-ordination and medical support in a major incidentRehabilitation co-ordination and medical support in a major incident Roles of the hyperacute rehab team in a major incident: To assist in creating capacity in the whole healthcare community to create beds (Back door) Hyperacute rehabilitation for new patients (Front door) Ideas to create capacity (Back door) At any one time in a Major Trauma/Neuroscience Centre, there will be a significant number of patients who are 'transfer ready' Usually there are more than 20 patients with medical clearance and more than 20 patients with predominantly R&R needs but partial medical clearance When creating capacity: Ensure routine healthcare is not put on pause Understand that creating capacity takes time Too much capacity is the default position in a major incident Estimate the scale of the response required and over-reactHigh quality hyperacute rehabilitation methods can support the major incident response and optimise patient outcomes Example: How the rehab team could support a major incident response Step 1 Liaise with the MI Duty Physician to permit displacement of patients from priority beds Prioritise specialist beds for creating capacity - neurosurgery, orthopaedics, ICU, Burns/Plastics - and focus on these Step 3 Identify 'Transfer Ready' patients Can the next care provider admit the patient now? Is there a community based rehab bed suitable for the patient? Can support be provided for families wishing to have patients at home? Can they be safely moved to an alternate bed within the hospital? Can any behavioural or care needs be met with the next provider? Are there any equipment issues? Can these be met by the next care provider?Step 2 Form up into a hyperacute team, consisting of: an occupational therapist a physiotherapist a discharge liaison nurse an administrator/clerical support Step 4For each patient transferred: Identify the level of medical clearance and if community follow up is required? Ensure equipment, care and rehab plans have been arranged. Liaise with next providers and families. Record discharge destinations and contact numbers centrally, for all displaced patients If a regional response is required to meet the scale of capacity expected: Alert other regional rehab services to create/declare capacity Alert community trusts to open Level 2b and 3 rehab beds Contact Care Commissioners: They may be able to release/prioritise funding for exceptional cases or additional capacity SO/13 Updated: 08/01/2020 v1.0 KEY POINTS Back door processes first - hyperacute rehab teams should assist in creating capacity in a major incident Front door processes second - hyperacute rehab optimises patient outcomes and supports the early major incident responseSpecialty overview Rehabilitation co-ordination and medical support in a major incidentRehabilitation co-ordination and medical support in a major incident High quality hyperacute rehab methods can support the major incident response and optimise patient outcomes Front door hyperacute rehabilitation For patients with;Acquired Brain Injury Does the patient have a Traumatic brain injury (TBI) or Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (HIBI)?
