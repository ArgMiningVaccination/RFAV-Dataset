You want to participate in a more in-depth program with lots of feedback and interaction with the instructor.

You want to take your aromatherapy or herbalism training to the next level, whether you're just beginning your studies or have already earned certifications. A foundation in scientific research is important to you. You want to focus on a more connected experience in the herbal / aromatherapy, starting with a deeper connection to the plants themselves. You dream of owning your own plant-based business so you can earn a living doing what you love, or you want to expand your skill and add another modality to your current practice. You want to learn more about growing your own herbs so you can have access to the highest possible quality materials for your apothecary. You want to learn how to distill your own hydrosols and essential oils at home with affordable, high quality equipment. About Your Instructor Hi, I'm Erin! I am a clinical herbalist, NAHA certified professional aromatherapist, urban homesteader, forager and organic gardener. I grow organic food and over 100 kinds of aromatic and medicinal plants for my apothecary, many of which I distill for their hydrosols and essential oils right here in my garden. My practice is based in the Pacific Northwest. I have a special interest in mental health, psychology and trauma-informed practice, and I have studied with several treasured herbal forebearers, including David Winston, Rosemary Gladstar and many others. I am so honored that you are considering studying with me and I truly look forward to getting to know you over the course of the next few years. With gratitude, Erin This program has been retired. We are currently in the process of transitioning the different modules in it into their own standalone courses. Frequently Asked Questions Q: How long do I have to complete the aromatherapy certification program? The educational content of this program is released in module-sized blocks once a month over the course of 2 years. Aside from the regularly scheduled content releases, it is self-paced, so you can take as long as you need to complete it. Most people will be able to complete it within 2-3 years whilst dedicating a few hours of study to the program each week. Q: I'm already a certified aromatherapist. Will this program help me? Aromatherapy programs vary widely both in quality and in content. I designed this one to be the most comprehensive, holistic, science-backed, from-the-ground-up program available. It greatly exceeds the educational requirements for NAHA membership qualification. While some of the information will be a review for you (essential oil chemistry and aromatherapy basics, as well as some basic essential oil blending techniques), you will also learn plenty of new things to help you better your practice, including how to work with the herbs themselves (and know when to choose an herb over an essential oil), how to cultivate an aromatic garden, how to build a thriving business, how to distill hydrosols and essential oils, and how to increase sustainability and efficacy in your practice. We also focus a lot more on scientific research than some of the other aromatherapy programs do. Most aromatherapy programs teach or require anatomy and physiology as a separate class. Our program incorporates it into our lessons throughout the anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology modules. Each of these modules includes science-based information about practical therapeutic applications for a variety of common conditions so you can be equipped to help yourself, your family and friends, and your clients support your / their health and wellness goals with herbs and herbal products. Q: I'm a beginner. Will this course be too difficult for me? I have designed the curriculum to be completely beginner-friendly and I will be here to walk with you through it from beginning to end. It's a great place to start and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have along the way. Q: Is the course about herbs or aromatherapy? Both. It's an aromatherapy certification program rooted in a foundation of herbalism. You'll learn everything you need to know to start a successful aromatherapy practice (or equip yourself to work with aromatherapy for your family and friends), but you will also learn how to work with herbs and how to know when to choose one over the other. Q: Will this program qualify me for membership with a professional organization? The curriculum for this program exceeds the educational standards set forth by professional aromatherapy organizations such as NAHA and AIA. Upon your graduation from this program (if you choose to earn your certificate), you will be eligible to apply for professional membership with them. Q: Is this program a 200-hour certification program? The curriculum for this program is equivalent to over 600 hours of training and exceeds the requirements for 200-hour programs. Q: How much does the program cost? Do you offer payment plans or refunds? The cost of the program is $3000 USD and we have several payment plan options available. You will be able to review your payment plan options when you enroll. Due to the nature of online courses, we do not offer refunds, so we recommend that you make sure this is the right program for you prior to enrolling. Once you have enrolled, you are responsible for paying the amount you owe the school in full. We are happy to answer any questions you may have prior to enrolling. Please feel free to contact us. Q: Are you a certified aromatherapist? What qualifies you to teach? Can I trust your information? Yes, I am a practicing clinical herbalist, certified aromatherapist and a professional member of NAHA, which is one of the leading aromatherapy organizations in our country. I have well over 2500 hours of education in the fields of herbalism and aromatherapy and am consistently furthering my own studies so I can continue to grow in my own practice and experience. I have grown over 150 kinds of medicinal and aromatic herbs for my own apothecary and distill hydrosols and essential oils here in my PNW garden. Q: Will this course prepare me to work with clients? This program is designed to take students from complete beginners to a level where they could build a successful aromatherapy practice and work with family, friends, or other clients on a professional level. By the time you earn your certificate, you will have a solid, science-based knowledge base that will equip you to practice as an aromatherapist. Some students will choose to use what they learn in their own homes, while others might wish to start a business or work within their own communities. To work on a deeper clinical level addressing more complicated cases, especially if you want to expand your skills in the field of herbalism, further training will be necessary and I do hope to offer further clinical training in the future. This program does not equip you to practice medicine, which requires a medical degree and a license to practice. "}
