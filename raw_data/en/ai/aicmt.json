Photograph by Shelby Walton. This reproduction of an apothecary jar represents how medicine is often stored tightly in unique jars and placed out of reach until needed. However, in Colonial America, medicine was not as restricted as we know it today. Apothecaries played a significant role in our nation's past by promoting the standardization of modern medicine and our current regulations. We find modern medicine and medical regulations beginning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Christopher Marshall established the nation's first apothecary shop in 1729. [[1]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn1) Over the next 100 years, Marshall's shop served its community by mixing and dispensing medicines for various ailments and training apothecaries. Stored in apothecary jars like the one pictured were remedies from herbs, animal parts, chemicals, and other natural ingredients. While intended to heal people, apothecary shops and their sometimes-hazardous medical concoctions led to modern medicine regulations and the standardization of medicine to protect public health. [[2]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn2) While the young nation embraced lassie-fare economic values, the lack of legal and professional regulation surrounding apothecaries and ingredients used for healing posed various public health concerns. Housewives, religious leaders, and even shoemakers practiced apothecary and dispensed medicines. [[3]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn3) As apothecaries increased throughout the nation, medical mishaps increased due to inconsistent dosages, poor-quality ingredients, or lack of ingredient labels. Public trust in apothecaries and medical treatment began waning as medical tragedies struck. A concerned physician, Lyman Spalding, noticed apothecary treatments could be more dangerous and life-threatening than patients' medical conditions. Lynman and Samuel Mitchill, a fellow physician and politician, brought these concerns to Capitol Hill, where they pushed politicians to improve the health and safety concerns of the young nation. [[4]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn4) Lynman and Mitchill's efforts established the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 1820, an independent nonprofit organization with the mission of building trust between medical practitioners and the public. USP also created the professionalization of medical practice as we know it today. The USP adopted medical codes and best practices and enumerated medical substances and their effects to inform practitioners. One critical best practice included properly labeling medicine jars, which apothecary jars often lacked, to prevent mixing toxic ingredients. Although this apothecary jar is labeled 'salsus,' the Latin word for salt, many jars contained one-word labels and did not provide medical uses, warnings, or dosage directions. [[5]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn5) These vague labels often led to incorrect dosage amounts and hazardous combinations, risking patients' lives and creating a primary concern for USP. However, USP was only the beginning of the United States' long history regarding the standardization of medicine and regulations. Shortly after, in 1821, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy established the first formal educational system for professional medical training. [[6]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn6) While apothecaries learned by apprenticeships, various institutions pushed for and gained formal medical education to prevent medicinal mishaps. The term pharmacist was coined to distinguish graduates from untrained apothecaries, representing a national shift from informal to formal medical practices. [[7]](//E6E883A7-153F-40F2-9358-392D31FD088E#_ftn7) Although the role of modern-day pharmacists varies from the role of apothecaries in Colonial America, we still see ties between apothecaries and modern medicine.
