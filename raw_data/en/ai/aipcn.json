Normally, when dogs poop, it expresses their glands naturally, releasing anal gland fluid. Dogs may also involuntarily express their own anal glands when they are scared or stressed. Expressing their own anal glands allows a dog to leave their scent behind to claim their territory near their home or in their yard during a normal bowel movement. When dogs meet, they sniff each other's hind ends and anal glands to gather information about the other dog's hormonal status. There are times, though, when these glands become full, impacted, or infected. Impacted or diseased anal glands can be painful, so it's important to recognize the signs of an issue and know what to do when it happens. When signs of anal gland disease persist, you should contact your veterinarian to schedule an exam for your dog. Here's what you should know about anal glands in dogs, from how they work and how they're expressed to the signs of anal sac disease and when to go to the vet. [What Are Dog Anal Glands?] Anal glands, or anal sacs, are two small pockets, each about the size of a small grape, located on the right and left side of a dog's anus. Each gland connects to a small tube that secretes a very distinctive, foul-smelling fluid. Under normal circumstances, when stool passes through the anus, it applies pressure to the glands and releases (expresses) the fluid. Both male and female dogs, as well as cats and other animals, have anal glands. These glands are not essential to your dog's health, and they can live without them if they need to be surgically removed for medical reasons. [Do Dogs Need to Have Their Anal Glands Expressed?] Most dogs involuntarily express their anal glands. If a dog's nutritional needs are being met with high-quality food, and they maintain a healthy weight and get plenty of exercise, they should not need to have their anal glands expressed. If your dog is not having an issue, there is nothing you need to do. Check with your vet if you are wanting to do routine expression. Your vet may recommend leaving the anal glands alone if they are not causing a problem, or they may agree to routinely express them to avoid a medical issue. Some dogs, however, require their glands to be manually expressed. If the consistency of your dog's stool changes, their anal glands will not be naturally expressed. Then the liquid in the glands will thicken, making it harder to be able to express. If this happens, the glands can become irritated, inflamed, infected, and even impacted. Once your dog starts to have issues with anal gland infections, impaction, or abscessation, it is usually best to have their glands expressed every 3-4 weeks to prevent the issue from happening again. Your dog's anal glands can be expressed by your veterinarian, a veterinary technician, or even some dog groomers.

Do not use more pressure than you would feel comfortable applying if you were pressing on your eyes, for example. - You should barely be able to feel the gland when it's empty. - Wipe the anal area clean. - Repeat on the other side for the other gland.

When the anal gland fluid thickens, this pasty, brown material clogs the glands and creates hard masses. In average cases of impaction, the anal glands can be expressed with significant pressure. Anal Gland Infection or Abscess A dog suffering from an anal gland infection or abscess will be in moderate to severe pain. If the gland is infected, the bacteria from the infection causes pus to build up inside the gland. An infection can then lead to an abscess when the pus-filled sac and swollen tissue cause the gland opening to be obstructed. You may see discoloration around the anal area or a red, hot, swollen spot on the hind end, often next to or inside the anal opening. Ruptured Anal Gland Abscess If an abscess is left untreated, it can rupture, and your dog will be in severe to extreme pain. The ruptures (fistulas) lead from the anal gland through the skin. You may see a greenish yellow or bloody pus coming from the ruptured gland. Anal Gland Cancer The anal glands may also be the site of cancerous tumors. The most common type of anal gland cancer is known as apocrine [anal gland adenocarcinoma](https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cancer/c_multi_adenocarcinoma_anal).

Symptoms associated with anal gland cancer include bloody stool, bleeding around the anus, swollen back legs, vomiting, increased thirst, increase urination, and lethargy. Your vet may also find elevated calcium levels in the blood (e.g., hypercalcemia). The anal glands may also be enlarged because of the mass, but no material is able to be expressed from the gland. [Treating Anal Gland Issues in Dogs] These conditions should be diagnosed by your veterinarian after a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal exam. Additional testing such as an ultrasound, fine needle aspirate, tissue biopsy, and/or a bacterial culture and sensitivity might be performed to help make a specific treatment plan for your dog. Most cases of anal sac disease can be treated with manual expression of the glands and local treatment with antibiotics and/or steroid ointments. Some cases will require oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory pain medication. In severe cases, surgical intervention might be needed. For anal gland cancer, your vet will need to determine if it has spread to the lymph nodes or other areas. You will need to consult a veterinary oncologist, and the treatment might include removal of the anal gland and sac, chemotherapy, or radiation.
