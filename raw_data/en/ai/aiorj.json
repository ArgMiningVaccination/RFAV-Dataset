The Program in MolecularMedicine celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, commemorating the innovative concept of collaborative research endeavors by clusters of scientists, rather than through individual departmental labs that were the norm for medical school researchers. The program's scientists study how biological systems work at their smallest level\u2014the molecule. Because certain diseases can be caused in humans by molecular defects in genetic material, studying the biology of these disorders at the molecular level could enable Molecular Medicinescientists to take aim at cancer, AIDS, diabetes and other diseases, thereby converting discoveries to therapies. Achievements over the decade include publication of the researchers' studies in the most widely read and recognized journals, in turn attractingmillions of dollars in funding from the NIH, prestigious foundations andprivate industry. For example, all three of the Medical School's facultymembers named as Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators areMolecular Medicine scientists (see related story, page 3), contributing toUMMS' position of number two am ong the country's 125 medical schools in the rate of research growth.Michael Czech, PhD, (center) director of the Program in Molecular Medicine with Adilson L.

Treistman, PhD, UMMS professor of biochemistry &molecular pharmacology and Mario Stevenson, PhD, the David J. Freelander Memorial Professor inAIDS Research, were each awardedextensions on their research\u2014Dr. Treistman into the molecularmechanisms of alcohol and drugaddiction and Dr. Stevenson into the molecular biology of AIDS. Only a small group of highlyregarded researchers are selected for these prestigious Method toExtend Research In Time (MERIT)awards each year. Granted on the basis of the researchers' past accomplishments,professional competence, creativityand productivity, the MERIT awardsallow Treistman and Stevenson tofocus on their work for additionalyears without the distraction ofseeking more funding. The principalfeature of the program is theopportunity for such investigators to gain up to 10 years of support intwo segments: the initial grant andthe extension of that grant. Treistman's research presumes that development of effective treatmentsfor addiction, such as alcoholism,will be significantly speeded by anunderstanding of the molecularbasis for drug craving and withdrawal.His work focuses on the molecular mechanism by which alcohol altersthe function of brain cells. Stevenson and his lab were the first to demonstrate that the AIDS virus is fundamentally different fromother types of retroviruses due to its ability to infect non-cycling cells.This property is what enables thevirus to infect macrophages, usingthem as a \"transport\" mechanism to disseminate the virus throughoutthe body; Stevenson believes thatonce this transport mechanism is better understood, a target to exploit for new drug therapies may be revealed. umms again makes top ten in u .s .news For the fifth straight year, the University of Massachusetts MedicalSchool has been ranked among the10 best medical schools in thenation by weekly news magazine U .S.

Hercareer has encompassed advancingthe nursing profession, educatingadvanced practice nurses, forginginterdisciplinary educational andclinical partnerships, shapingnursing policy and practice and,above all, caring for patients. Harper brings her vast knowledge, experience and enthusiasm toUMMS for the unparalleledopportunities she sees here forinterdisciplinary collaborations. She looks forward to fostering evenmore collaboration among the three schools at UMMS, the UMassMemorial clinical system and thecommunities of centralMassachusetts. She delights in the fact that the GSN is the onlygraduate nursing school inMassachusetts based at an academic health center; that there exist richand as yet untapped opportunitiesfor collaboration statewide; and that UMass Memorial boasts asignificant cohort of advancedpractice nurses in its system. \"The opportunity to develop and test models of interdisciplinaryeducation, practice and research are unlimited and unique amongacademic health centers across thecountry, \" noted Harper. \"Faculty andstudents in the Graduate School ofNursing are afforded the benefits ofan environment dedicated to qualityhealth care for our communities andresearch programs that improveoutcomes for persons affected bysuch diseases as cancer, HIV ,cardiovascular disease and diabetes. \" by sandra l. grayDoreen Harper, PhD, CS, ANP , FAANVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:02 PM Page 56 Vitae fall - winter 2000In addition to servi ng as national coordinator, a role she will continue here, she also co-directed theWashington Regional Academic and Community Consortium(WRACC), one of just six CP-GMNEpartnership sites nationwide. \"It was a real challenge to get twohealth systems, two universities, six community clinics and fiveresidency programs to worktogether. My job was to balance the agendas of community andacademic medicine and nursing to benefit patients in thecommunity. \" Harper was invigoratedby the huge task at hand. \"It hasbeen so rewarding to lead sixnational projects all clearly focusedon one single great mission!\" Serving the underserved has been the driving force behind all Harper'sachievements. \"My first nursingassignment included alcoholics on the Bowery in Manhattan's lowerEast Side, and from there I moved to working with poor mothers andchildren in the South Bronx. Rightfrom the start I was where I wantedto be, \" she recalled. \"I thrived on the caring aspect of nursing, helpingpatients find meaning in whateverexperience they were having.\" Evenas her life in academe took centerstage, Harper continued in clinicalpractice, working part-time at theHarper's goal for the GSN is simple but ambitious: to be in thetop 50 percent of graduate schoolsof nursing in the country by 2005. She maintains that the essentials to move the GSN forward areespoused in its mission to makepractice and research the keystonesof education. Her tactics to grow the student body and facultystrategically in fulfillment of thismission are concrete: enhance the research agenda and increaseresearch funding; promote facultypublications in scholarly journalsand appointments to nationalboards; support faculty practiceto strengthen education andresearch; expand linkages betweenthe Worcester and Amherstcampuses, as well as other healthsciences programs statewide;develop curricula that are responsiveto changing health care workforceneeds; and link with UMMSinitiatives such as CommonwealthMedicine and the Center for HealthPolicy & Research. In the face of nurse practitioners' evolving scope of practice anddeclining nursing schoolenrollments, Harper steadfastlybelieves that graduate nursingeducation is directly related toclinical excellence in nursing. \"Graduate education lays thefoundation for the clinicalinfrastructure for excellent nursingcare, both hospital- and community-based, \" she maintains. \"The modelis the same as for graduate medicaleducation: new clinicians learn bybeing surrounded with clinicalexperts. \" With clinical nursingexperts virtually removed fromhospitals over the past 15 years in the wake of managed care, Harper sees graduate nursingeducation, in partnership with other health professions, as the one sure path to restoring the clinical infrastructure for all nursesin the hospital setting. \"Fortunately,UMass Memorial, in partnershipwith UMMS and the GSN, hasmanaged to prepare and maintain a critical number of highlycompetent advanced practice nurses, continuing to develop interdisciplinary practice models for care delivery, \" Harper stressed. \"The GSN faculty, all of whom are strong practitioners andexcellent teachers, have been able to generate 'real world' educationand research programs based on these partnerships and their involvement in practice. \" And when Harper talks about partnerships, she means on a largescale. As National Coordinator forthe Community Partnerships in Graduate Medical and NursingEducation Initiative (CP-GMNE), a W . K. Kellogg FoundationInitiative in Health ProfessionsEducation, Harper has broughttogether multiple institutions withdiverse missions and culturesaround their common goals to trainclinicians in community settings to deliver primary health care tovulnerable populations. \"I thrived on the caring aspect of nursing, helping patients nd meaning in whatever experience they were having. \" Vitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:02 PM Page 6fall - winter 2000 Vitae 7and Services Administration. Harper is thrilled as well as honoredwith this opportunity to shapepublic health policy at the highestlevel. \"A focal point of my work withthe Kellogg Foundation has been todevelop national policy objectives tosupport interdisciplinary community-based h ealth care, \" she noted. Today, Harper stands at the crossroads between the pioneers of higher education in nursing of the 20th century, and the future of advanced nursing practice in the 21st century, with her sights set firmly on building the model for how medicine and nursing willwork together in the next century.\"We've got to explore and analyzehow to best merge expertise frommultiple disciplines to do our bestfor the patient. At UMMS andUMass Memorial, we've got thecritical mass of clinical experts andresearchers to do this. \"George Mason University Student Health Services during the sameyears she was building the school'snurse practitioner program inpartnership with George WashingtonUniversity School of Medicine andHealth Science. Most recently,volunteering on the Family HealthConnections Mobile Van inWoodbridge, Virginia, has kept her face-to-face with patient needsin the community. Harper's own earliest muse was her mother, a dedicated nurse in the Rhode Island community where she grew up. \"I remember sitting around the card table with mymother and her friends. They were all nurses and all leaders. \" She earned her BSN from CornellUniversity in 1971, her MSN fromCatholic University in 1974 and herPhD in human development andgerontology from the University of Maryland in 1980. In the early 1980s, Harper was a faculty member at George MasonUniversity and young mother of twotoddlers when she unintentionallycatapulted herself into the nationallimelight as an advocate for nursepractitioners. When the GemenacReport proposed that there was anexcess of physicians and, therefore,no need for nurse practitioners,Harper co-authored and published with friend and colleague MollyBillingsley, \"The Extinction of the Nurse Practitioner: Threat or Reality?\" in Nurse Practitioner Journal . \"The article struck a chord. People either loved or hated it, and it was seen as a call for solidarity. It marked my identity as a politicalactivist, \" she recalled with pride. She and Billingsley published asequel titled \"Organizing for Power\"that garnered support from nursingleaders nationwide and forwardedthe nurse practitioner organizationalagenda for unification. Harper also became a founding member and president of theNational Organization for Nurse Practitioner Faculty (NONPF) with the mission of providing leadershipto promote quality nursepractitioner education. Both Harperand NONPF have focused onfostering the development ofcommunity-based clinical curriculaalong with didactic learning. She led the organization to conceptualizeand develop its Curriculum Guidelines and Program Standards for NP Education . This work was recognized in 1994when Harper was elected as a fellowin the American Academy of Nursing.

Clinical research trials conducted at UMMS reveal how years of bench study can lead to e\u00b0ective treatments at the bedside. DiseaseonTrialVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:03 PM Page 8fall - winter 2000 Vitae 9A research study that tries to answer scientific questions and tofind better ways to prevent, diagnoseor treat disease must sooner or laterfind ways to methodically determineif a proposed treatment works forreal people. (That's the \"clinical\"part of clinical trials, as compared to\"basic,\" laboratory-based research.) At the University of Massachusetts Medical School, clinical trials testnew drugs, compare two or moredrugs, evaluate new procedures ornew technologies (such as surgicalinstrumentation) and herald a newworld of potential benefits. At anygiven time, there are as many as 300 different clinical trials beingconducted by UMMS facultyclinicians, and more are on thehorizon: so many more, and somany with such potential, thatUMMS recently developed a newClinical Trials Office. Investments made in support of basic biomedical research continueto pay off in new discoveries andnew treatments: a generation ago,an understanding of disease at thecellular level changed medicine;today, the molecular basis of cellularactivity is leading scientists onthousands of new investigativepaths. This new understanding of what happens deep inside cells,and how molecular processes can be affected, means that scientists are looking for and finding individual, molecular targets that can change what happens inside a cell, and by extension, inside ahuman body. A new clinical trial atUMMS, one ready to begin testingan innovative method of genetherapy, illuminates the excitementand promise of medical researchwith a human impact. Gene therapy has always proven to be astonishingly complex,although it' s understandable that it would be. The principle of genetherapy is to alter, supplement,repair or replace a gene that causes an illness or one that isn'tfunctioning normally. One of themajor challenges of gene therapy is the process of implanting aparticular gene into cells and havingit \"express, \" or do what it's supposedto do. Yet, of the gene therapy trialsthat have been effective thus far, mosthave the ultimate aim of replacing a gene gone wrong with one thatfunctions normally. A new clinical trial underway at UMMS, a trial whose concept wasconceived and developed here, hopesto add a normally functioning geneto bone marrow cells to help thecells survive the impact of chemo-therapeutic drugs. Pamela Becker,MD, PhD, associate professor ofmedicine and chief of the Divisionof Gene Therapy, and her colleagues,including Peter J. Quesenberry, MD,the Eleanor Eustis Farrington Chairin Cancer Research, and former UMMS professor F. Marc Stewart,MD, now at the Fred HutchinsonCancer Center in Seattle, have\u2014after an exhaustive review andapproval process by the FDA and the NIH\u2014received approval to begin the innovative trial. Using a portion of a retrovirus as a vehicle, or \"vector,\" to move a geneinto a patient's cells, Becker willattempt to deliver a gene, MDR1, to initiate a complex cellular processcalled multi-drug resistance. MDR1helps essential cells in the bonemarrow survive chemotherapy: if multi-drug resistance is increased,conceivably chemotherapy dosesaimed at stopping otherwiseintractable cancers can be increased.For example, for those patients witha cancer called lymphoma, whichcan be aggressive and intractablebecause it grows rapidly and doesn'trespond to conventional levels of chemotherapy, increased drugresistance could mean that higherdoses of chemotherapy might stopthe lymphoma without stoppinghealthy cells in the patient's body. \"This clinical trial, which we hope will demonstrate that this method of gene delivery and this vectormodel works, has been very carefullydeveloped here at the UMass CancerCenter,\" explained Dr. Becker. \"The idea, the basic science research,the development of the protocol,and the extensive refinementnecessary to meet the stringentapproval process of the NIH and the FDA, all happened at UMMS. \" Pamela Becker, MD, PhDVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:03 PM Page 9\"The first phase of this trial is solely aimed at determining if thevector we've chosen will work,allowing the genes we deliver to bepicked up by the cells and expressed.That would be a huge accomplishmentin the ultimate story of gene therapy,and we will have taken a stepforward not only toward treatingcancers, but also toward treatinggenetic disorders. \" Because of the rapid progress and the potential for harm in the field of gene therapy, the FDA and theNIH have instituted strict and exhaustive scrutiny of all suchclinical trials. Becker can point to a mountain of paper on her deskthat includes the formal applicationand months of questions andanswers between her office and thefederal Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee, which must approve allgene therapy trials. As a result, theUMMS trial has been designed withextensive safeguards and pain-staking care, so that the outcomewill point toward some futuretherapeutic path. \"We'll first look to see if the retroviral vector works and then see if the cells pick up MDR1, \" saidBecker.\"The purpose of a phase one trial such as this is to answerthe question, 'can it be done?' We'renot looking, necessarily, for this to be a cure. But this is a necessarystep toward that. \" Shan Lu, MD, PhD A key step toward the NIH's goal of developing a vaccine for HIV by 2007 is the award of an HIV Vaccine Design and Development Team (HVDDT) research contract to Shan Lu, MD, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Medicine,and project partner Advanced BioScience Laboratories, of Kensington, Maryland. The NIH has committed approximately$70 million over the next five years to just four public-private partnerships worldwide, in an effort to accelerate thedevelopment and testing of promising HIV vaccines. \"Our laboratory has been focused on novel vaccine development for the last eight years, \" said Lu. \"The HVDDT program is the result of a year-long international search to build a consortia of scientists with development expertise from industryand academia who have identified promising HIV vaccine concepts.

Maurice Goodman, PhD, professor and founding chair of the Department of Physiology,recalled the excitement and challenge he andthose first faculty members faced in 1970\u2014the late Fred Fay, PhD, John Walsh, MD, andJoshua Singer, PhD\u2014as they began building a department that has come to exemplify thesuccess of the entire institution.\"We started everything from scratch, \" said Dr. Goodman, who was recruited from Harvard byfounding Dean Lamar Soutter, MD.Goodman in turn recruited Drs. Fay,Walsh and Singer from Harvard andset up shop in the Shaw Buildingwhile the Medical School buildingitself was still under developmentand construction, and the admin-istration scrambled to organize. \"We needed to create a whole teaching program, get researchunderway and develop the labs, \"Goodman recalled. \"The MedicalSchool had at that point no rules of governance, no policies of any kind, really. Chairs for second-year departments hadn't even been recruited yet. But there was a feeling of destiny, of challenge. The shakiness of the early yearsnecessitated support and a spirit of cooperation. Anyone who didn'tfeel that either didn't stay or gotscared away before they even gothired. This was a new adventure. \" And, in the fall of 1970 when the first class of 16 medical studentsarrived, \"we felt more like colleaguesthan anything else, and we weren'tthat much older than they, \" saidGoodman. \"The students were in their mid twenties and the facultywere all in their late twenties or earlythirties. It was fun. There was greatcamaraderie among faculty andbetween faculty and students. \" Dean Soutter relied on his newly recruited chairs to establish theirdepartments and help build parts of the school's infrastructure.(Goodman recalled with a laugh,however, that the dean scrutinizedevery purchase. \"He returned apurchase order for a book I wantedfor the department library we weretrying to compile. He had writtenacross it, 'But, you bought a bookyesterday. '\") The pioneers quicklyrealized the need for an office tohandle research grants, bothfinancially and administratively.Goodman helped established theGrants and Contracts Office, whichhas evolved into the UMMS Office of Research, currently overseeing an annual research budget of morethan $93 million. As he contributed to the growth of the Medical School in general,Goodman\u2014who filled over the years the positions of acting provost,acting chancellor/dean and associatedean for scientific affairs, amongothers\u2014from the start saw theDepartment of Physiology become a special place to work because\"people were willing to worktogether.

Now, the future seems likeit will make the present seemarchaic in even less time. \"But the highlights of the history of the department are mainly told in the stories of the careers ofindividual scientists. Science is, after all, an endeavor of peopleworking on their own projects intheir own labs. The way has beenpaved with plenty of hard work andfrustrations, but it is not withoutnotable successes. \" Grigg himselfmay hold a record for the University'slongest running research grant, a National Institutes of Health grantin its 27th year that's approvedthrough early 2004.The department can boast the Medical School's first grant, awardedto Goodman in 1970 from the NIH:$98,000 for three years to studygrowth hormone and fat metabolism;by 1973, before the Medical School'sfirst commencement, extramuralfunding for the department hadexceeded $50,000. By 1975, topped $150,000 and by 1977,it climbed to $250,000. Fundingsurpassed the million dollar mark by 1982 and two million just sixyears later. Today, the Department of Physiology ranks 11th of allphysiology departments nationwidein terms of NIH research supportalone\u2014approximately $6.5 million. In addition to an excellent track record for winning researchfunding, the department can alsoclaim an impressive publicationrecord, beginning with Fay's\"Reversible Disaggregation ofMyofilaments in Vertebrate SmoothMuscle, \" published in 1973 in the Journal of Cell Biology , the department's first publication ofresearch completely performed atthe University. Contributions to theprestigious Handbook of Physiology by both Goodman and John Fray,PhD, professor of physiology,followed, and by 1979, thedepartment had published 50research papers in scientific journals.Today, that number exceeds 1,000.Other UMMS firsts to come out of the department?

The department has, of course, had its losses, most notably thedeath of Fay in 1997. Faculty havecome and gone, but, as Goodmansaid, \"People tend to stay and, moreimportantly, stay productive. We'vebeen a successful department interms of research and teaching andcontributing to the school, and wecan be proud of that. \"Our charge in the beginning was to develop a Department ofPhysiology that would be second to none in New England, in terms of both NIH grant funding andreputation.

Two of many success stories are those of Zuoshang Xu, MD, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry &molecular pharmacology, and John Leong, MD, PhD, associate professor of molecular genetics & microbiology. Dr. Xu used his 1998 ARF grant to shift the entire focus of his research.Previously involved in researchingthe structure and function offilamentous proteins in nerve cells,Xu wished to pursue more disease-relevant investigations. Thanks tothe grant, Xu was able to hire aMolecular Genetics & Microbiology faculty Dannel McCollum, PhD, assistant professor, and William Theurkauf, PhD, associate professor, are among the most recent group ofgrant recipients. And, although it isyet unclear if the team will be anothersuccess story for the program, bothbelieve the research they plan ishighly fundable if successful. Knowing that a hallmark of cancer is rapid cell division, Drs. McCollumand Theurkauf will use their $30,000funding to devise and implement amethodology for screening 30,000 to 50,000 small molecule agents,compiled in a data bank of randomregenerated synthetic drugs, to seetheir affect on inhibiting celldivision. Since both investigatorswork in different research models\u2014McCollum with yeast and Theurkaufwith fruit flies\u2014they teamed to offerthe research strengths of both,including the knowledge of geneticmake up, to the testing. All concur that it would be impossible to conduct new avenuesof inquiry without funding sourceslike the ARF grant. Leong said,\"These grants are an invaluableinvestment by the Medical School in its faculty. The WFBR providesscientists with the monies to get a research idea off the ground andhopes that this research will lead tomore lucrative funding from NIHand other sources. \" postdoctoral fellow and begin working on the puzzle of ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease, \"muchearlier than I would have been able to otherwise.\" Since then, Xu was awarded an NIH grant of approximately $1million based on preliminary dataand published articles completedwith the help of the ARF funding.He has also recently applied forseveral additional grants to continuehis work studying how themitochondria, the \"powerhouse\"of the motile cell that provides theenergy necessary for the cell tofunction, is negatively impacted bythe mutant enzyme that causes ALS. Dr. Leong used his 1999 ARF funding to pursue the development of a smallmolecule that w ould block intestinal colonization by entero-hemorrhagic E. coli , the strain of E. coli responsible for numerous deadly outbreaks inrecent years. His research generatedthe preliminary data needed to enablehim to submit and receive a $1.2million NIH grant over five years topursue a related E. coli project. \"There are very few funding sources that will award grants for projectswithout some preliminary data anddocumentation to support thepremise, \" said Leong. \"These ARFgrants are indispensable when itcomes to starting research fromground zero. \" Annual Research Fund enables scientists to launch studies that gain the attention of prominent funding sources. by lynn c. borella Zuoshang Xu, MD, PhD | John Leong, MD, PhD | Dannel McCollum, PhD | William Theurkauf, PhD Vitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 1:44 PM Page 14New and competitive renewal grants of $50,000 and up are listed here according to broad areas of research and funding sources. cancer american cancer society Charles G.

But earlier this year, I could not pass up the opportunityto have Sandra join my office as executive assistant. In order to continue our commitment to responsive service for our growing number of graduates of the School of Medicine, Graduate School of Nursing and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Karen Shea, who joined Sandra in the Alumni and Parents RelationsOffice three years ago, and Charlene Nemeth, formerly director for development relations, are now your primary points of contact forall events and issues impacting alumni and parents. You are in great hands. Karen, as director of alumni and parents giving, and Charlene, as director of alumni and parents relations, will expand programs already in place and continually assess the need for additional ones, both based on your invaluable feedback. Their goal is tocreate consistent and focused opportunities for alumni and parents of future graduates to communicate with each other and UMMS.More regional alumni receptions, reunions that include continuing medical education sessions, a revamped Web presence, and a new alumni directory are just some of the methods Karen and Charlene will employ. Please contact Karen at(508) 856-3372 (karen.e.shea@umassmed.edu) and Charlene at(508) 856-5863 (charlene.nemeth@umassmed.edu) with your latest news and ideas. Now allow me to bring you up-to-date on three of our alumni, profiled in more detail on the following pages: Robert Spiro, GSBS class of 1984, is director of Bone and Cartilage Research for California-based Orquest, Inc., where he develops therapies toencourage the natural regeneration and repair of bone, cartilage and other skeletal tissue. Spiro finds that research \"never dead-ends; it just keeps moving in new and unexpected directions.\" Mary Ellen Foti, a 1983 School of Medicine alumna and UMMS assistant professor of psychiatry, advocates for the severely and persistently mentallyill of our state, by providing proactive treatment based on data collection, evaluation and outcomes analysis. Foti uniquely utilizesquality control measures to \"help clients realize their potential for a semi-independent life outside the hospital setting.\" Neil Goldstein, School of Medicine class of 1979, is always open to new challenges. \"I've maintained the mindset that the greatest value of amedical degree is its ability to open up a myriad of opportunities.\" Goldstein has molded his medical degree into entrepreneurship,overseeing clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies as president of Precision Research, Inc., a company he co-founded. Aaron Lazare, MDVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:06 PM Page 1718 Vitae fall - winter 2000 In 1979, Robert C. Spiro, PhD, didn't get into medical school. But that was, he said, a good thing. An alumnusof the Graduate School of BiomedicalSciences class of '84, Dr. Spiro isdirector of Bone and Cartilage Researchfor California-based Orquest, Inc. Since1994, he has been on the cutting edgeof orthobiologics\u2014the developmentof therapies to encourage the naturalregeneration and repair of bone,cartilage and other skeletal tissue. Spiro was always drawn to the sciences and initially believed thatbecoming a medical doctor was theonly way to reach the pinnacle of ascientific profession. Instead of thebedside, he found his passion at thebench. \"Research was the ultimatescientific challenge I was looking for.\" His path to Orquest was charted through a mix of talent, mentoring and serendipity. After graduating fromMcGill University in 1977 , Spiro cameback to his native central Massachusettsto take a job as a research technician in the pharmacology department atUMMS, a position he hoped wouldprepare him for admittance to medicalschool. At the urging of his mentor,Robert Humphreys, MD, PhD, heentered the PhD program instead and found his calling in research. Spiro's appetite whetted, he signed for his post-doctoral studies and became afaculty member at the Scripps ResearchInstitute in California, where hecontinued his work on thecharacterization of proteins producedby cancer cells. \"This eventuallybrought me into the extracellular matrix field,\" he said. That matrix\u2014the scaffold or template that serves as the foundation for almostall tissues of the body\u2014is critical inguiding both the development as wellas the repair or regeneration ofdamaged tissue, Spiro explained. As luck would have it, the mid-1980swere watershed years for theextracellular matrix field\u2014and Spirocaught the wave. After leaving Scrippsin 1991, he joined Telios Pharma-ceuticals in San Diego as principalscientist and then Orquest in 1994, a start-up in Mountain View, California. At Orquest, Spiro worked on the development of Healos \u00ae, a bone grafting matrix for patients sufferingfrom degenerative disc disease andsevere back pain requiring spinalfusion. Rather than the traditionaltherapy, which required harvestingmaterial from a patient's hip, Healos \u00ae is a mineralized collagen matrix thatmimics the properties of natural boneand guides the healing process. Theproduct is approved for use in bonegrafting implications in Europe and iscurrently in trials in the United States. Orquest has two other projects either in or about to begin clinical trials, bothusing similar principles to acceleratethe repair and regeneration of bone and bone fractures. After that? Tendons, ligaments, soft tissue defects,blood vessels, nerves? The options areas limitless as the composition of thehuman body. And that's the beauty of research, according to Spiro. It never dead-ends; it just keeps moving in new and unexpected directions. - KSRRobert C. Spiro, PhD '84researcher ' s options are limitlessVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:06 PM Page 18fall - winter 2000 Vitae 19 UMMS Assistant Professor of Psychiatry Mary Ellen Foti, MD '83, always knew that she wanted to be a doctor.Her steps never faltered on this careerpath, but during the journey shediscovered that quality controlmanagement\u2014the career field chosenby her father and two pharmacistbrothers\u2014was also in her blood. Today, this physician is an advocate of proactive treatment for the severelyand persistently mentally ill (SPMI)based on data collection, evaluationand outcomes analysis. Dr. Foti is the medical director for the Massachusetts Department of MentalHealth's MetroSuburban Area, a geo-graphic service delivery designationencompassing 58 cities and townsfrom Wilmington in the north toSouthborough in the west, Scituate in the south and east to Boston. In thisrole, Foti oversees the clinical manage-ment of some 3,000 individuals withSPMI who reside in the area's two statehospitals, a community mental healthcenter, or in communities where theyreceive DMH-funded residential andpsychiatric case management services. \"My staff and I strive to help clients realize their potential,\" said Foti. \"Our daily agenda is guided by ourultimate goal for each individual: a semi-independent life outside thehospital setting. We achieve thisby implementing quality control\u2014a process of ongoing data collection,evaluation and modification ofindividualized treatment plansbased on the evidence. \" It is this dedication to improving circumstances for her clients supportedby fastidious attention to detail thatgarnered Foti a unique opportunityto help them. In 1998, she becameprincipal investigator of the RobertWood Johnson grant.Among 800 projectwas one of 22 selected for funding. \"The data show that even for the general population, end-of-life care is inadequate. Considering the addedburden imposed by SPMI, whichisolates its sufferers from mainstreamhealth care initiatives, and thedisturbing fact that these individualsalso die far younger than the generalpopulation, I knew this was something I had to pursue.\" Foti's approach to this grant uses principles of quality managementand evidence-based treatment planningto design and implement end-of-lifecare services for the mentally ill. Alongthe way, she hopes to identify factorsrelated to this population's health careutilization and early mortality andincorporate this data into a health andwellness campaign and smokingcessation program that she has inde-pendently initiated for this group withexperts from other health care fields. \"The mentally ill have been traditionally excluded and stigmatized in society,\"Foti concluded. \"I'm promotingcollaboration in all fields of health careto improve their quality of life.\" - LCBMary Ellen Foti, MD '83quality control brings quality of lifeVitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:06 PM Page 1920 Vitae fall - winter 2000 Neil H. Goldstein, MD '79Neil H. Goldstein, MD, has never been so wedded to a particularpath that he's closed his eyes to newchallenges. \"The greatest value of amedical degree is that it will open up a myriad of opportunities, \" he said.\"I've always maintained that mindset.\" Dr. Goldstein has molded his medical degree into entrepreneurship, servingas president of Precision Research, Inc.(PRI), the company he and his partnerDonald H. Paris founded in 1997. The evolution was a natural one, he said. It was a simple case ofopportunity knocking, and Goldsteinanswering the door. After graduating from UMMS in 1979 and completing his postgraduate workat George Washington UniversityHospital in Washington, D.C., Goldsteinwent into practice, serving as chief ofinfectious diseases at a new communityhospital in Pennsylvania. Then in 1987 ,the headhunters came knocking,looking for a specialist to overseeclinical trials for a pharmaceuticalcompany. Did Goldstein know anyone?His response: \"Maybe me.\" His decision to go corporate was met with incredulity by his colleagues.Goldstein laughs as he recalls oneconcerned physician asking him: \"Are you okay? Did something happen?Do you think maybe you should getprofessional help?\" Such a responsewas understandable, said Goldstein,noting that it wasn't until recently thatpharmaceutical research was accordedthe respect it deserves. After 10 years working for progressively larger companies, Goldstein decided to set up shop on his own. He and Paris,who had 25 years of product develop-ment experience, founded PRI, whichprovides the range of services clients need to bring a project through conception to the marketplace, includingprotocol development, trial monitoringand medical writing. The company,which started out with just Goldstein,Paris and a secretary, has grown into aprofitable business employing six staffpeople and the services of 25 clinicalresearch associates and medical writers. While PRI counts such industry heavy-hitters as DuPont andAstraZeneca on its client list, it hasfound its niche with smaller companiesthat don't have the on-staff capacity todevelop protocols, monitor trials oreven collect the data needed to attractinvestors. \"The biotech work has been a whole lot of fun,\" Goldstein said. \"It shows a completely different side of the business.\" Goldstein's experience\u2014he is board certified in internal medicine and infectious diseases\u2014has provided PRI with the foot in the door it neededto get off the ground. The company'sability to adapt its scope and range ofservices to meet the specialized needsof its diverse client base has keptthat door open. Adaptability has been the key to Goldstein's success as well. Histransition from practicing physicianto businessman is nothing more than a matter of simple evolution, he said. \"I always knew what I wanted to study,but I never had a complete idea of whatI wanted to do with my medical degree.\"At PRI, he is still finding out. - KSRwhen opportunity knocks...Vitae/fall'00/text.final 10/18/00 12:06 PM Page 20fall - winter 2000 Vitae 21Class Notes: 1975 Anita Karcz, MD, was featured in the \"Movers and Innovators\" section in an August 1999 issue of Mass High Tech .

An exceptional group of individuals has been appointed to ensure theattainment of these goals\u2014and theyare up to the challenge. The membersof the Campaign for Research SteeringCommittee, co-chaired by Robert M. and Nancy Edman Feldman of WestNewton, are: From Greater Worcester Bruce Carlin, managing partner of the accounting firm Carlin, Charronand Rosen, LLP , and a director of theUMass Memorial Foundation Matthew F.

Weagle completed radiationtreatment this February and has seensuch an improvement in her health thatshe frequently spends up to five hoursa day campaigning for public office. As members of Team Weagle passed the new research laboratory building on the UMMS campus September 4, the building's steel framework providedtangible inspiration to meet the Walkto Cure Cancer's goal of $5 million in fiveyears for UMass Cancer Center facilitiesto be housed there. The researchconducted in the labs may find the cure Weagle is convinced is waiting to be revealed. \"We must find it,\" stressedWeagle. \"Two of my friends who walkedwith me have been diagnosed with cancer.\" For more information about supporting the UMass Cancer Center, contact theDevelopment Office at (508) 856-5520.During the 1999 inaugural Walk to Cure Cancer, Susan Weagle started but couldnot complete the entire five-mile coursedue to the effects of chemotherapy. This Labor Day, Weagle joined her teamof 75 walkers with the same mentalenthusiasm as the first time, but with the added physical strength that allowedher to finish the walk and help raiseapproximately $5,000 toward finding a cure for cancer. Through the effortsof some 6,000 others like Weagle, the 2000 Walk to Cure Cancer raised over $500,000 for cancer research. \"I am convinced that a cure is out there now,\"said Weagle. \"If everyone participated inor donated to an event such as this walk,we'd be a rriving at a cure sooner, rather than later.\" Thankfully, Weagle realized her own cure sooner, rather than later.
