It is never going to give the quality of hydration that our bodies need to thrive. Recent advances in water research has proven what many people over the years have understood instinctively. It is the structure of the water that is of primary importance for health. Water that has got the ideal molecular configuration has received many different labels including 'structured water', 'hexagonal water', 'revitalized water' or 'EZ water'. All are different names applying to the same thing. It is one of the principal reasons that water has got life supporting qualities. Energy Plus is a unique configuration of water filter (Top) to give high levels of contaminant removal in addition to enhancing water structure through the activity of bioceramic filter media. Bioceramic filter media are ceramic beads (Bottom) composed of natural minerals and crystals that improve water structure by emitting low levels of far infra-red energy. This water has got specific properties. Professor Pollack of the University of Washington is one of the foremost researchers in this field and has coined the phrase EZ water (exclusion zone) . His book 'The Fourth Phase of Water' gives a detailed explanation of his research findings. He has discovered that water changes from an unstructured state (H20) into a structured state if it contacts hydrophilic surfaces (water-loving surfaces such as cell membranes). This water is no longer H20 but H3O2. This new structure gives the water new properties which are hugely important for human and animal health. One of the primary benefits of this quasi-crystalline water (EZ water) is its ability to displace dissolved substances during the restructuring process from H2O to H3O2. All substances such as toxins, salt and protons are displaced. This has very far reaching benefits for human health and demonstrates the need to drink water that is going to help the body build as great a layer as possible of structured water around our cells. It is probably the simplest and most important things we can do to help reduce cellular degeneration due to toxicity. We have ever increasing levels of chemical toxicity in our environment and in the food chain and consequently everything we can do simply to protect our cells from toxin damage is going to enhance our quality of health and our life expectancy. We are now seeing ever increasing loading of electro-magnetic stress impacting our health. Professor Pollack has commented that he believes that properly structured EZ water will help to displace the adverse impact of electromagnetic wave lengths on our cells. One of the best known ways to improve water structure is through light or far infra-red wave lengths. This discovery is now being utilized to develop technologies that can help to simply and cost effectively structure water. At Water for Health we have been using some of that technology for a number of years. We use different types of minerals and crystals in water filter systems that emit low levels of far infra-red energy and improve water structure. Our mission is not just to give clients clean water (although that is important) but rather to give people water that is health enhancing. This is critical for our immunity, our energy levels - in fact for our quality of life. Many people have bought into the idea that as far as water is concerned that as long as they consume 2 litres per day then all is well. It is not the amount of water we drink that is critical it is the amount we absorb that will benefit us. Drinking clean water with good structure will be of value to people of all ages. At Water for Health we offer a wide number of options to help everyone benefit from these recent scientific advances that offer us so much to improve our wellbeing.

Seagreens\u00ae - The Ruby One & The Mineral Salt Since 2008, Seagreens\u00ae has pursued a programme of nutrition research not only to provide the full range of micronutrients, but to address population health concerns like obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and dementia. Our applied research, using our whole food seaweeds, has differed from conventional studies using only 'extracts' isolated from seaweeds, and very often from seaweeds which consumers are unlikely to be able to eat. Over the years we have set up harvesting operations in remote coastal locations in Norway, Scotland, Ireland and Iceland, where to date we have selected, researched and produced 5 native wild species - Alaria, Ascophyllum, Fucus, Palmaria, and Pelvetia. To access the full range of species it matters less which individual Seagreens\u00ae products you choose. It's more a question of how you want to use them. All deliver Seagreens\u00ae valuable micronutrients and health benefits including iodine. Mix and match and use them to get your gram of nutritious food seaweed in your daily diet including through our popular salt replacement products. [https://seagreens.shop/product/the-ruby-one-55g/](https://seagreens.shop/product/the-ruby-one-55g/) Replacing half your daily salt with seaweed was an innovation when we introduced The Mineral Salt in 2011. Healthier than any kind of salt, half Seagreens\u00ae, half natural sea salt. You get salty, mineral and umami flavours, with comprehensive nutritional balance. The Ruby One takes it further, mixing two distinctively aromatic native wild seaweeds, with just 25% natural Dorset sea salt. The combination produces a unique, salty umami flavour and a comprehensive balance of rare dietary micronutrients, notable for vitamins B9 (for folic acid), B12 and K, and Omega 3 fatty acid, EPA and DHA, and DPA. Use it on the most sophisticated foods, but breakfast will never be the same again! The Ruby One's full nutritional profile is now available as well as the product through [Seagreens.Shop](https://seagreens.shop/product/the-ruby-one-55g/).

This is good news as it means everyone has the opportunity to reduce their risk with some simple lifestyle changes. A new programme, called COGNITION shows people exactly how to dementia-proof their diet and lifestyle by understanding their personal level of risk and then providing them with a plan to reduce that risk. COGNITION is the result of ten years of research by the charity FoodForTheBrain.org which has tested 380,000 people via their free online Cognitive Function Test. According to research by NHS and University College London researchers, 88% find the test useful and most go on to make positive diet and lifestyle changes as a result. The first step is to take the cognition test and then you complete a questionnaire that works out your future dementia risk. It also tells you exactly what's driving your risk up. [FoodForTheBrain.org's](https://www.foodforthebrain.org/) new 'brain upgrade' programme COGNITION helps you lessen your risk one step at a time with personalised, interactive instructions and email coaching, plus reminders via text or WhatsApp. Users also have access to supportive groups on Facebook and Zoom, and are given activities to improve their cognitive function, with everything designed to support you in making brain friendly changes to your diet and lifestyle. The charity is supported by leading Alzheimer's prevention experts in eight well established areas of risk. These areas of risk are: lack of B vitamins, lack of seafood and omega-3 fish oils, too much sugar and carbs, too little exercise, social and cognitive stimulation, not eating enough antioxidants from fruit and veg, not having a healthy gut, not sleeping well and stress. Targeting all eight earlier in life may reduce future dementia risk by as much as two thirds. But how do you know what your risk is and what and how to change to reduce your risk? That's what the COGNITION programme is all about. Helping people identify and make small changes to protect the brain. [Foodforthebrain.org](https://www.foodforthebrain.org/) is aiming to enrol a million people as 'citizen scientists', sharing research results with all involved to learn what really works. \"Alzheimer's is not an inevitable consequence of ageing.\" says the charity's founder, Patrick Holford. \"We want to empower people to take charge of their own health, tracking changes and biohacking. In the coming months we'll be offering our citizen scientists a pin prick blood test to measure things like omega-3, vitamin D, glucose and B vitamin status. Our goal is to continue to research and establish what really keeps people healthy and protects us from preventable and crippling diseases such as Alzheimer's.\" To test your cognitive function and find out how to dementia-proof your diet and lifestyle go to: [https://www.foodforthebrain.org/](https://www.foodforthebrain.org/) References The statements and studies referred to are shown in their document Alzheimer's is Preventable: A Manifesto for Change [https://foodforthebrain.org/aipmanifesto](https://foodforthebrain.org/aipmanifesto) The recent study showing that sugar levels predict Alzheimer's from age 35 was published in March 2022, from research at Boston University Medical School - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35319157/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35319157/) About FoodForTheBrain.org The Food for the Brain Foundation is a UK based charitable foundation that developed a fully validated Cognitive Function Test in 2012 and has so far tested 380,000 people.

Simultaneously the nervous system responds to the oscillations and ripples of movement with deeper breathing and a boost to circulation - giving a tangible sense of heightened well-being. While these FlexxiCore devices can never replicate the individual care and precise targeting of manual treatments, they effectively mimic the natural patterns of exercise itself, complementing the hands-on approach of a practitioner in a way that clients positively enjoy. As no compression or manipulation is involved, adhesions and distortions in the neuro-myofascial web are gradually released with minimal intervention. The FlexxiCore Challenger uses Whole Body Vibration (WBV) technology - a proven method of accelerating the effects of exercise with over 200 published studies covering its many beneficial effects. For example, at least 10 studies* have reported WBV-induced increases in strength, power and performance in young healthy adults. The original WBV Power Plates\u00ae found in many gyms are sophisticated devices, but generally too bulky and expensive for home use or for most practitioners to invest in. The FlexxiCore Challenger is reasonably priced, built to last, and easily moved with its inbuilt roller. It combines vibration and oscillation with different programmes that create an exercise-like experience, helping to generate elasticity in the fascia. Trials undertaken with the Challenger (42 participants - age range: 39 - 85) saw substantial improvements in just 60 days in 16 different categories of benefit, including Core Muscle Strength; Energy Levels and Stamina; Fitness/Performance Levels in Other Activities; Posture; Muscle & Joint Aches, Tension and Stiffness; Toning; Pain & Headaches; Sleep Patterns; Improved balance; Better Motivated to Exercise Generally; Stress Release. While the Challenger's unobstructed platform allows for use with a variety of movements, stretches and poses, the FlexxiCore Passive Exerciser generates truly effortless motion within the torso, combining the energising and stress-releasing effects of Japanese \"Goldfish Exercise\" with the back-care benefits of the Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) devices first designed by a Canadian Orthopaedic Surgeon. The FlexxiCore Passive Exerciser's design evolved from the Japanese \"chi machine\" format that aimed to simulate energy and circulation effects by swinging the feet, thus generating a pulsing motion in the area of the dantian energy centre below the navel. With its greater width of travel the FlexxiCore mobilises the whole of the back. This is combined with precisely adjustable speeds over a broad speed range, starting with a gentle 80 RPM, allowing people of all ages and fitness levels to experience the release of tension in back, neck and shoulders that many of us need to counter the challenges of poor posture.

If you've tried all the age-old tricks - lavender oil, meditating, herbal teas, or a nice long bath - to no avail, then the team behind the NEW Levagen+ BED Supplements may have the answer to your prayers. Over 70% of participants* in recent user trials said that taking it saw them fall asleep quicker, and over half of respondents said they had a better night's sleep compared to not taking it - what's not to love? The pressures and distractions of the modern-day world mean that most people no longer get the estimated seven to nine hours that our ancestors took for granted. Nowadays, stress, hormones, mental fatigue, balancing family life and new hybrid working patterns have meant that many of us are experiencing shut-eye deprivation - that's where Levagen+ BED can help. [https://naturestruthlevagen.co.uk/](https://naturestruthlevagen.co.uk/) - Levagen+ BEDcontains an ingredient referred to as PEA, which stands for Palmitoylethanolamide, that behaves in a similar way to CBD. (Fun fact: PEA is enjoying a huge surge in interest at the moment with Google searches for PEA increasing by 42% over the last 28 days alone - it's going to be big.); - PEA is regarded as the real-life version of a 'chill pill'. This saturated fatty acid derivative lowers inflammation, triggers the body's defence systems to deal with any pain, and inhibits mast and glial cell activity - known as the 'glue' of the central nervous system; - Besides the clinically backed up PEA, the BED supplements contain B6 and magnesium which are proven to reduce tiredness and fatigue as well as improve the function of the nervous system; - L-Tryptophan has also been added, an amino acid that the body naturally converts into serotonin. It helps to control your mood and sleep and leaves you feeling cool, calm, collected and (hopefully) asleep. Who Can Take It? Suitable for vegans, just take two tablets (ideally with food) once a day before bed and you should be able to see a noticeable difference in your sleep. In the user trials* conducted, 71% of participants saw an improvement in how long it took to fall asleep with 52% claiming that they also got more sleep compared to not taking it. 60% also reported higher concentration levels.With no contraindications, only those who are pregnant are advised not to take it.
