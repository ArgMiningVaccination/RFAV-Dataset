Get natural, effective, and individualized healthcare from the comfort of your home. READY FOR YOUR CHILD TO BE HEALTHY AGAIN? READY TO PREVENT FUTURE DISEASE? Young Medicine is for you if... you're tired of not getting answers from other providers you desire seeing a Doctor that will assess your child through a holistic lens you prefer natural treatments, but want to hear both conventional and holistic treatment options you're sick and tired of spending money on supplements and labs and not seeing any improvements you're interested in seeing your child healthy for decades to come HI, I'M DR. MICHELLE YOUNG, THE FOUNDER OF YOUNG MEDICINE, I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE My belief is that naturopathic pediatrics is the most effective health care philosophy for treating and preventing most childhood conditions. As Naturopathic Doctors with a family focus, our teams goal is to find the root cause of illness and guide and support you and your child on the road to true health. You and your family shouldn't have to go through this alone. GETTING STARTED IS EASY: 1. BOOK A DISCOVERY VIDEO CALL This is where you get to know the doctor and find out if they are the right fit for you. 2. INITIAL APPOINTMENT We meet virtually, and gather information about your concerns, recent labwork, health history, nutrition, lifestyle, supplement, and medication routine. During this appointment you and your provider will discuss goals of working together. 3. PERSONALIZED CARE PLAN Naturopathic Medicine excels at finding the root cause of symptoms. Our providers treat the root cause of disease, not just the symptoms. And therefore, no treatment plan is the same. 4. FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS This is where we continue working on the plan and make modifications as needed. 5. GET LASTING RESULTS Work with us to implement the treatment plan and find hope in a new approach to whole-family healthcare. Our goal is always to get young / your child healthy, and then have you stay healthy. WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING: \"Dr. Michelle is such a gift to our family. We had seen several pediatricians before seeing her, but they all shrugged off our concerns we had and weren't able to offer any real solutions-just band aids. She was able to give us real answers and solutions for our concerns and the results we got have been incredible. You can tell she stays up to date on research and can easily break down complex topics for us parents, so we are educated on what's going on!\" -JH \"Before working with Dr. M my son struggled with severe eczema. I tried all of the treatments recommended by his pediatrician and suggestions from friends and family, with no relief. Dr. M helped us find out why he had eczema through lab tests and then treating his gut problems. Now I have a healthy son with no eczema. I couldn't recommend working with Dr. Michelle at Young Medicine more!\" -AB \"My husband and I are SO thankful for Dr. M. We really appreciate her heart when it comes to vaccines. You can tell she truly has every child's best interest at heart and is willing to have an open conversation to guide us to the best decision for our family. We left our vaccine consultation feeling so much more educated on vaccines, what risk factors our daughter has, and how we can improve her health before and after her vaccines. What a gift "}
