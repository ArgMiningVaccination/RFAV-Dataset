Birdee, MD, MPH,1Kathi J Kemper, MD, MPH,2 Russell Rothman, MD, MPP,1and Paula Gardiner, MD, MPH3 Abstract Introduction: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used among women, but few national data exist regarding CAM use during pregnancy or the postnatal period.Methods: Data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed for women ages between the ages of 18 and 49 years who were pregnant or had children less than 1 year old. CAM use was identied basedon standard denitions of CAM from the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine. CAM use among women who were pregnant or with a child less than 1 year wascompared with the other similarly aged female responders. CAM use was examined among these women stratied by sociodemographics, health conditions, and conventional medicine use through bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models.Results: Among pregnant and postpartum women from the ages of 19 to 49 years in the United States, 37% of pregnant women and 28% of postpartum women reported using CAM in the last 12 months compared with 40%of nonpregnant/non-postpartum women. Mind-body practices were the most common CAM modality reported,with one out of four women reporting use. Biological therapies, excluding vitamins and minerals, during thepostpartum period were used by only 8% of women. Using multivariable regression modeling, we report nosignicant difference in CAM use among pregnant compared with non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.88; [95% condence interval 0.65-1.20]), but lower CAM use postpartum women compared with non-pregnant women (AOR 0.67; [0.52-0.88]), while adjusting for sociodemographics.Conclusion: CAM use among pregnancy similar to women who are not pregnant, while postpartum CAM use decreases. Further evaluation of CAM therapies among pregnant and postpartum women is necessary todetermine the costs and benets of integrative CAM therapies in conventional care. Introduction Approximately 40%of adults in the United States use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), with higher use among women than men.1In a study of data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), Harrigan reported that of 2,673 women who interacted with any ob-stetrician/gynecologist for medical care, 31.8% reported CAM use, while only half of these women disclosed CAM use to a physician.2Harrigan did not specify how many of these women were pregnant or postpartum, and limited dataexist regarding CAM use during pregnancy or the postpartum period in the United States.3-5A 2010 systematic review on CAM use during pregnancy cited a broad prevalence ranging from 1% to 87%.6Authors noted that varying denitions of CAM may contribute to reported differences. Studies based on the Australian Long-itudinal Study on Women's Health from 1996 to 2006 re- ported no differences between nonpregnant and pregnant women in CAM use over time.7Pregnant women tended to use CAM to relieve specic pregnancy related conditions including back pain, tiredness, and dysuria. Half of women reported seeing a CAM practitioner for pregnancy relatedconditions (neck pain, sciatica).8It is unknown if these trends hold true for women in the United States. Research is lacking on the efcacy and safety of CAM among pregnant and 1Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. 2Department of Pediatrics, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio. 3Department of Family Medicine, Boston University Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.JOURNAL OF WOMEN'S HEALTH Volume 23, Number 10, 2014\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2013.4568 1 postpartum women. For example, although almost 60% of pregnant women used a dietary supplement in one European study, limited data were available on safety and efcacy ofsupplements used.9Women's use of CAM may be affected by general attitudes and perceptions of CAM and conven- tional therapy during pregnancy. Women tend to avoid the adverse effects of pharmacotherapy10or other conventional therapy during pregnancy and postpartum.11In contrast, women who use CAM were more likely to perceive CAM as more natural, safe, and as effective to conventional care.6 Despite the lack of denitive effectiveness research, the use of CAM during pregnancy and postpartum is clinically relevant. For example, as new mothers transition to breast-feeding, botanical supplements may affect breast milk, whichin turn may affect infant health. 12,13According to the CDC, 49% of women 6 months postpartum and 27% of women 12 months postpartum reported breastfeeding.14It is unclear if breastfeeding women are less or more likely to use CAM therapies. Another example is low back pain which com- monly affects pregnant women.15In the general population, back pain is the most common reason individuals seek CAM therapies.1CAM therapies are also frequently used for mood disorders in the general population,1though the role of CAM for women suffering postpartum depression is not clear.16 With the effects of many CAM modalities on maternal andfetal health unknown, patterns of CAM utilization duringpregnancy and after delivery are important to identify. The primary purpose of this study was to examine CAM use among women who reported being pregnant or having a child within the past year. We hypothesized that CAM useamong pregnant women would be less than the general fe- male population because of the unknown safety of many CAM approaches during pregnancy and that botanical sup-plements would be the most common CAM modality. We also hypothesized that during the 1 year postpartum, when breastfeeding is common, CAM prevalence would be lowerthan for other women in the same age range. Based on priorstudies of sociodemographic factors associated with CAM use, we anticipated that CAM use among pregnant and postnatal women would be highest among individuals whowere younger, white, and had higher income or education. Materials and Methods We examined data from the 2007 NHIS which sampled 75,764 noninstitutionalized individuals about health condi-tions, conventional medicine use, and CAM use. NHIS was conducted face-to-face in English and/or Spanish and had a response rate of 76.5%. We analyzed data les from the 2007NHIS, including the Family Core, Adult Core, Sample Child,and a special additional survey administered in 2007 Adult CAM Supplement. The Family Core collects information regarding socio- demographics, health insurance, and healthcare access. The Adult Core collects information from a randomly selected individual in the household on health conditions includingpregnancy status, healthcare utilization, and medical condi- tions. To identify pregnancy status, all women from the ages 18 to 49 years were asked, ''Are you currently pregnant?(Yes, No).'' To identify mothers with children less than 1 year of age, we utilized data from the Family Core ques- tionnaire to identify women who had biological children lessthan 12 months of age in the household. We excluded chil- dren less than 12 months of age that were not identied as biological children in the same family. The Adult CAMSupplement asked individuals about use of 36 types of CAMtherapies in the last 12 months as listed in Table 1. For analysis, we selected women from 18 to 49 years as the study population. We combined CAM modalities into vecategories as dened by the National Center for Com- plementary and Alternative Medicine (See Table 1) 17: mind- body practices, biologically based, manipulative/movementbased practices, whole medical systems and traditional healers, and energy medicine. We combined all CAM ther- apies into a single category for any CAM use in the previous12 months. We excluded vitamins and minerals from theCAM category because these are commonly consumed by women during pregnancy and the postnatal period (e.g., prenatal vitamins). Data derived from the Family Core including socio- demographics were categorized for analyses. For some so- ciodemographic covariates (race, education, and region), thesample size for subcategories were small ( n<30) by pregnancy status. Since these small samp le sizes are not accurate for Table 1.Complementary and Alternative Medicine Modalities Surveyed in National Health Interview Survey CAM categoriesaIndividual CAM Modalities Biological therapies /C15Diets practices/C15Chiropractic/Osteopathic /C15Massage /C15Movement Therapies (Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais, And medicine /C15Energy healing aComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Categories based on criteria dened by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.2 BIRDEE ET AL. reporting, we collapsed these covariates into the following categories to provide sufcient cell sizes for analyses and reporting: race (non-Hispanic white vs. other), education (high school graduate or less vs. more than high school), andgeographic region (South vs. other). These categorizations are consistent with prior NHIS reports of CAM use being less prevalent among non-whites, lower education, and theSouth. 1Age was analyzed as a continuous variable and also dichotomized (18-29 and 30-49 years). NHIS queries in- the following categories: $0-$34,999,$35,000-$49,999, $50,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, and$100,000 and over. Since CAM use is less prevalent among lower income populations, we presented the data by iden- tifying low income as less than $35,000 based on theavailable categories. We categorized the following other covariates of interest ap r i o r i for analyses: health insurance (private vs. other including Medicaid, uninsured, and un-known); self-reported health status (excellent or very good versus good, fair, or poor); prescription medication use (yes, no); and difculty affording medications (yes, no). We an-alyzed selected medical conditions based on clinical rele- vance to this population (yes, no): lower back pain, depression/anxiety, and sleep problems. Missing data onfamily income and personal earnings in the 2007 NHIS wereimputed using multiple-imputation methodology. 18 Global chi-squared tests of independence were used to compare any CAM use and major CAM categories amongwomen from 18 to 49 years of age by pregnancy status and the presence of a child less than 1 year old in the household. We compared patterns of CAM use by sociodemographics,conventional medicine use, and selected medical conditions. We developed bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify variables associated with overall CAM useamong women currently pregnant and 1-year postpartum.For regression analyses, we selected variables with p\u00a30.20 in bivariable analyses for consideration into a multivariable model. Multivariable models were built with a backwardelimination strategy retaining factors with p\u00a30.05. SAS- callable SUDAAN 9.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Re- search Triangle Park, NC) was used to obtain appropriateweighted national estimates for the United States population in 2007. This study was reviewed by the Vanderbilt Institu- tional Review Board and considered exempt from full boardreview.Results NHIS surveyed 7244 women in the United States between the ages of 19 and 49 years representing 66 million women nationally, of whom 3.8% ( n=269) were pregnant and 6.2% (n=453) had a child within the last year. The median age of this sample was 33 years. Among all women in this agegroup, almost 39.9%\u2014representing 25 million women\u2014 reported using any CAM in the last 12 months (Table 2). Pregnant women had similar rates of CAM use to nonpreg-nant women (36.7% versus 40.7%, p=0.47). CAM use was signicantly lower among non- pregnant women (27.8% versus 40.7%, p<.05). Mind-body practices were the most common CAM mo- dalities used by all women (24.4%), pregnant women (25.3%), and postpartum women (22.0%). We found no signicantstatistical differences in CAM use by modality among preg- nant women. Biologically based therapies were less com- monly used among postpartum women than by pregnant or allnonpregnant women (8.2% vs. 17.5% or 17.3% respectively,p<.05). Manipulation and body-based practices were also signicantly used less by postpartum women than pregnant or all nonpregnant women (11.7% vs. 17.6% or 18.7% respec-tively, p<.05). Table 3 reports the prevalence of CAM use by socio- demographics and selected medical conditions. CAM useamong pregnant or postnatal women versus nonpregnant/ postnatal women was signicantly lower in women who were younger, lived in the South, lived in households with lowerincome or less education, and had non-private insurance (chi-squared statistic p\u00a30.05). Women within 1 year postpartum had no signicant differences in CAM use by race, region, marital status, or type of insurance. CAM use was signicantlyhigher among all women with self-reported anxiety or de- pression and sleep problems. Using multivariable regression modeling we found no signicant difference in CAM useamong women who were pregnant (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.88, [95% condence interval 0.65-1.20]), but were postpartum (AOR 0.67 [0.52-0.88])while controlling for other sociodemographics (see Table 4). Conclusion The prevalence of CAM use is the same during pregnancy but less during the postpartum period as compared withTable 2.Prevalence of CAM Use by Modality Among Women by Pregnancy and Postnatal Status All women N=7,290Not pregnant or postnatal n=6,569Pregnant CAM modalityNumber %Number %Number in thousands % p-ValueaNumber in thousands %ap-Valuea Any CAM use last 12 months 26,864 39.9 24,796 40.7 957 36.7 therapies 11,410 8.2 <0.05 Mind-body Practices 24.4 14,918 0.21 and body-based practices11637 10714 17.6 464 18.7 0.93 450 11.7 <0.05 Prevalences reflect weight estimates based on the United States population in 2007. ap-Values based on chi-squared test for for pregnant or postnatal versus not pregnant or postpartum.CAM USE DURING PREGNANCY AND THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD 3 nonpregnant women, particularly in regard to biologically based, manipulation, and body-based therapies. One out of four women reported using mind-body practices regardless of being pregnant or postpartum. CAM use was highestamong women who were white and who had a higher income and education, private insurance, and selected medical con- ditions including lower back pain, self-reported anxiety ordepression, and sleep problems. These results are consistent with other international re- search surveys of CAM use among women. For example, the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health reportedthat 48% of pregnant women reported visiting a CAM practitioner and 52% reporting use of a CAM product. 19In a longitudinal report from the same cohort, CAM use wasnoted to increase with age but did not differ signicantly between pregnant and nonpregnant women.7These results are consistent with our regression model in which CAM usedid not vary by pregnancy status. Data from the Australian cohort and other epidemiological studies suggest that women may seek CAM to treat preg- nancy related conditions such lower back pain,3 19,20anxiety, and depression.21We found a higher use of CAM amongpregnant women with depression/anxiety and sleep prob- lems, though after controlling for other sociodemographic factors, these differences were no longer signicant. Emer- ging data suggests that mind-body therapies may be bene-cial during pregnancy for anxiety22and depression.23 Mind-body therapies may be especially attractive duringpregnancy given concerns of potential adverse effects ofpsychotropic drugs on fetal development, low cost, and easyaccessibility. 6,10,11 In a population-based case-control study from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, the reported prevalence ofherbal use before and during pregnancy was 10.9% and 9.4% respectively,24which is lower than our results nding that biologically based therapies were used by 17.3%. It is unclearwhy the prevalence varies between our studies, but it may stem from different descriptions and questions of herbal use, ''Did you use any herbs or folk medicines to treat any medicalconditions, to lose weight, or just to keep you healthy?''(National Birth Defects Prevention Study) as compared with the question, ''During the past 12 months, have you taken any herbal supplements listed on this card?'' (National HealthInterview Survey).Table 3.Prevalence of CAM use Among Women Aged 18to49Years by Pregnancy or Postnatal Statusa All women Not 24.2 30-49 41.2 41.4 42.9 35.4 Race 0.5 White 42.2 43.1 41.7 29.7Non-white 31.8 32.5 26.0c25.3 Region 0.25 Non-south 43.7 44.7 44.5 29.0South 33.5 34.2 29.0c28.2 Marital Status Married 40.1 40.9 38.6 32.8 0.88Not married 39.9 40.8 38.3 19.9 $35,000 44.2 44.0 45.9 40.7 Maternal education \u00a30.05 More than high school 49.5 50.0 49.7 46.0High school or less 25.7 27.1 21.2c12.7 Insurance 0.86 Private 47.4 47.5 47.6 45.6 Non-private 32.8 34.0 30.4 19.8 Back Pain 0.46 Yes 53.3 54.7 47.1 41.4 No 35.5 36.3 35.0 23.8 Depression/Anxiety Yes 53.9 54.9 51.7c43.2c\u00a30.05 No 35.8 36.5 35.9 25.6 aPrevalences reflect weight estimates based on the United States population in 2007. bp-Values based on chi-squared test for pregnant or postnatal versus not pregnant or postpartum. cEstimate not reliable or precise due to small sample number less than 30.4 BIRDEE ET AL. Our nding of lower CAM use, specically botanical, manipulation and body-based therapies, during the post- partum period is an important new nding. Mind-bodypractices were used at a rate similar to pregnancy andnonpregnancy periods. In the postpartum period, women may use CAM to treat postnatal depression and to support breastfeeding. Very limited high-quality evidence exists onCAM use for the treatment of postnatal depression. 25Bio- logical therapies have been used and studied for breast- feeding mothers as galactagogues26and to treat breast engorgement.27While historically herbal remedies have been used by breastfeeding women for centuries, very little data exists on safety for and effects on the newborn health.26 The NHIS survey did not ask if women were breastfeeding,s ow ea r eu n a b l et om a k ead i r e c ta s s o c i a t i o no fb r e a s t - feeding and CAM use. Decre ased use may represent ma- ternal concerns for biological therapies being transmitted totheir infant via breast milk. Our study has several limitations. As a cross-sectional study, we are unable to identify a causal associations relatedto CAM use and pregnancy or postpartum status. Secondly, our sample size was insufcient to look at specic medical conditions or biological therapies (e.g., herbs) related toCAM us among this population. Survey data is based on self- report and therefore prone to recall bias. The survey did not collect data on breastfeeding, which would have been veryinformative. There may be unidentied confounders, such asmaternal parity, which affect CAM use that were not con- sidered. The sample population was limited to English and Spanish speaking adults. Many women use CAM throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, though women use biologically based and manipulative therapies less postpartum. Future epidemio- logical studies of CAM during pregnancy and postpartum arenecessary to identify specic reasons and potential benets and risks. Clinical trials are needed to determine efcacy and safety for commonly used CAM therapies to help guidepregnant and postpartum women to promote health for themselves and their infants.
