Fasting is a feature of many religions: the 40 days of Lent in Christianity, Ramadan in Islam, Yom Kippur in Judaism. Hindus and Buddhists fast regularly. These days, it's not religion but the excesses of our 21st-century lifestyles that underly a burgeoning industry of \"detox\" regimes aimed at cleansing the kidney, liver, digestive system and skin. People often instinctively feel the need to abstain for a while, but choosing what to do and how to do it can be a challenge because of so much conflicting advice. \"Detox gets your body back on track [and allows it] to process what is in there,\" says Alison Johnson, dean of the Australasian College of Natural Therapies. She recommends it after sickness, stressful events or \"bingey\" periods of eating and/or drinking. \"Even those of us with the best intentions cannot avoid all the external pollutants in our world,\" says Tini Gruner, a practising naturopath and lecturer at the school of natural and complementary medicine at Southern Cross University. She points to the chlorine in our tap water, the car exhaust fumes we breathe, the pesticides in our soil and the stresses caused by our work and families. To be healthy, Gruner says, we should \"cut out all the crap at least once a year: the bickies, the caffeine, the alcohol, the sugar and other stimulants\". Gruner fasts and teaches her naturopathy students to prescribe detoxes to their clients. These include water fasts, juice, raw-foods or herbal-supplement diets and colonic irrigation. Predictably, these regimens have many critics in the medical establishment, such as Professor Tim Gill, co-director of the Centre for Public Health Nutrition at the University of Sydney. He argues none is scientifically proved, some are dangerous and others are little more than temporary, quick-fix solutions. \"Whenever you make a radical positive change to your lifestyle, it makes you feel good psychologically. Detox diets are the same. They may make you feel momentarily virtuous but have no long-term health benefit unless you move away permanently from a bad lifestyle,\" he says. Keeping this in mind, let's look more closely at some of the cleansing regimens just in case you are still in the mood for a purge. WATER FASTS Water fasting is the most extreme type of fasting but it allows the body to heal itself more efficiently and also leads to physical rejuvenation, says Alec Burton, a British-trained osteopath and chiropractor who runs the Arcadia Health Centre in Dural. Over the past 30 years he has monitored more than 30,000 people on water fasts. His underlying philosophy is: \"The body is self-constructing and self-destructing but self-repairing if we give it a chance.\" You should not go on a water fast at home, he stresses, but rather do it under supervision at one of a few dozen health retreats to be found across the country. When you stop eating, your blood-sugar level will drop and if it's not monitored daily you could cross the line from fasting to starving and eventually fall into a coma. Clients come to Burton suffering from complaints as varied as migraines, insomnia, ulcers, colitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, asthma and skin diseases. After an initial physical and psychological examination, which includes some laboratory tests to look at liver function and blood sugar, Burton prescribes a fast for as little as three days but on average for 20 to 30 days. He will not accept pregnant women, epileptics, type-one diabetics or cancer sufferers. During the fast, the body first breaks down glycogen stored in the liver and muscles. By the third day these fatty acids break down into ketones, which the body then uses as a source of energy, Burton says. If you have a caffeine or sugar addiction you may initially experience withdrawal headaches. A coated tongue and bad breath are other side effects. At least 10 per cent of Burton's clients feel extreme nausea or start vomiting because of excess bilirubin, or bile pigment, in their stomachs because of increased liver activity. The main danger of fasting, Gill says, is that over time you lose muscle as well as fat. You also flush out electrolytes, potassium and sodium. It can even affect your heart rhythm and kidney function. Burton says although you may lose up to half a kilogram of weight a day during the fast, in the long term it may cause your metabolism to slow down by up to 5 per cent. This could make it more difficult to lose weight in future, he says, although you can regulate your metabolism with more exercise and a healthy diet. The Arcadia centre focuses on client education and uses the first fast as a stepping stone to permanent changes in clients' lifestyles, Burton says. COLONIC IRRIGATION Colonic irrigation, colonic lavage or colonic therapy basically means washing out the bowel and colon by inserting a tube into the anus and pumping in water with a hose, which can vary from the diameter of a pencil to that of a 50-cent piece. Bianca James, a registered nurse with a postgraduate qualification in gastroenterology, opened the Sydney Colon Health Clinic in 1991 and it is now the largest facility of its kind in Australia. All her clinicians are registered nurses with 600 hours' practical training. All the tubes used are disposable, the water is purified and all the equipment is purpose-designed by James's company. To begin the procedure the patient lies on the treatment sofa, which has a hole in the middle of it leading directly into a toilet. \"The process is gravity fed,\" James says. \"We push water in gently and you push out if you need to eliminate anything. There is no risk of damage.\" James's patients range from four-year-olds to the elderly. \"They do it to feel good and to look good,\" she says. \"Some have chronic bowel and colon conditions, even cancer, or they are constipated pregnant women or they just have a stressful lifestyle.\" As in other therapies, James stresses that counselling is a large component: educating her clients about a healthy lifestyle and encouraging them to lose weight. Many come back for irrigation every month, she says. James also worked with the NSW Department of Health to draw up regulations for the industry, which consists of about three dozen naturopathy clinics across the country. This followed a scare in 2000, when one centre passed on hepatitis C to several patients. Other side effects from colonic irrigation can include perforated bowels, bleeding fissures and hemorrhoids. Associate professor Terry Bolin, a past president of the Gut Foundation and expert in gastroenterology, says: \"I don't condone or recommend colonic cleansing. When you do irrigation, the hazard is your electrolytes are depleted and you wash the good bacteria out with the bad. I think the preparations you take for a colonoscopy are adequate if you need to clean yourself out.\" Bolin is also concerned there is no licensing requirement to open and run a colon clinic and the operators do not need to have any specific qualifications. FIBRE AND HERBS In conjunction with the various cleansing regimes and to accelerate internal cleansing, homeopaths also recommend specific herbal supplements. These include milk thistle or Swedish bitters, which contains ginseng and dandelion leaves. \"It's the principle of consuming something bitter to help your liver function,\" Southern Cross University's Gruner says. Dandelion roots are a laxative and its leaves are a diuretic. They can be eaten in a salad, steamed or drunk in tea, homeopaths say. They also contain potassium, one of the minerals lost in detox regimes. Blood-cleansing herbs include burdock root, turmeric and curly or yellow dock, which is also a lymph and bowel cleanser and a mild laxative, as is liquorice. Psyllium is a seed-husk fibre that can be added to cereal, sprinkled on fruit or added to juice. It adds a balance to your bowel and assists in the control of both diarrhoea and constipation, either of which may happen while you fast or detox. Increasing your fibre intake is also important to maintain a continuing level of internal cleansing, Bolin says, and will decrease your chance of developing bowel diseases and conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease, a condition of the large intestine. He recommends two servings of vegetables a day, wholegrain cereals, bread, brown rice and pasta and avoiding foods made from white processed flour. Getting the fibre balance right is also important. Having too much fibre can also be a problem, especially for women, who may feel bloated. This may be because of a wheat allergy, Gruner says, recommending isolation diets that eliminate wheat and dairy foods to increase a client's internal wellbeing. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES One of the most popular fruit and vegetable regimens is The Liver Cleansing Diet, developed by Dr Sandra Cabot in 1996 in Sydney, which won the Australian People's Choice bestselling non-fiction book award in 1997 and sold hundreds of thousands of copies around the world. The eight-week diet involves a regimen of drinking water and fresh fruit and vegetable juice, and eating raw vegetables and fruit, focusing on those that are orange, yellow, red and green and leafy. The purpose, Cabot says, is to accelerate liver function by getting the liver to burn excess fats and toxins stored in it, by feeding it foods high in antioxidants and by using liver tonics with ingredients such as milk thistle. \"The point is 20 per cent of adults have fatty liver and many children and teenagers who eat fast food do too,\" Cabot says. \"But the liver is one of the most forgiving organs and my diet shows you can reverse the problem, repair your liver, and control your weight.\" A fatty liver means that the liver has stopped burning fat efficiently and instead has turned into a fat-storing organ and has become enlarged and swollen. People with this condition have a higher chance of developing high cholesterol, cardiac disease and type-two diabetes. They find it difficult to lose weight until they improve their liver function. Bolin describes the liver-cleansing diet as \"extraordinarily strict\" and difficult for most people to adhere to. \"People may feel better after six weeks or so and also begin to lose weight but the real long-term benefits are not documented. Accurate medical diagnosis and treatment of the cause may be a better way to go,\" he says. (Sandra Cabot is profiled on the Health Careers page.) DETOX WITH CARE \"Don't blindly follow the detox advice out of a women's magazine, which is generic and may make you feel worse,\" says Alison Johnson, dean of the Australasian College of Natural Therapies. Neither do many homeopaths recommend do-it-yourself detox kits from chemists or health food shops, or selecting your own detox herb capsules and teas. Instead of self-medicating, visit a homeopath to get a tailor-made diet. However, some treatments are worth trying, says naturopath Dr Tini Gruner. For example, home enema kits can be a safe and cheaper alternative to colonic irrigation. Successful detox also depends on timing: don't start fasting when you have a stressful time coming up. You may not have the energy or patience to cope. If your job involves driving long distances or operating heavy machinery, it may be dangerous to detox at work because your concentration will be affected. You also shouldn't start or end the fast with a burst. \"Don't gorge yourself the day before you start the fast or you will have an engorged stomach,\" Johnson says. Similarly, getting drunk the day you finish a detox is not suggested or you may get an absurdly strong reaction. Gruner says it's a good idea to allow yourself a transition period and to start the detox program slowly and then wean yourself back into your normal diet when it's over. \"Don't use a detox as a yoyo. Don't think you can eat and drink what you want and purge yourself and everything will be fine. If you abuse your body, the free radicals will do damage there and then, if you keep abusing it, you will do long-term damage over decades.\" Creating a cycle of inhibited and then uninhibited behaviour of bingeing and purging is also a dangerous psychological state, says Dr Tim Gill of the Centre for Public Health Nutrition, University of Sydney, and could lead to such eating disorders as bulimia. The only way to really enjoy long-term wellbeing, Gill and alternative medical practitioners agree, is to follow the well-worn advice of getting lots of sleep, eating fresh foods from all the food groups with lots of fibre, minimising caffeine and alcohol intake and exercising regularly.
