In clinical trials, 1 patient died due to autoimmune hepatitis. Liver injury, including autoimmune hepatitis, can occur at any time during treatment with ZINBRYTA, with cases reported up to 4 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. ZINBRYTA is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease or hepatic impairment [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CI) and WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. Prior to starting ZINBRYTA, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and and bilirubin levels [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)]. Test transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly and assess before the next dose of ZINBRYTA. Follow transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly for 6 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. In case of elevation in transaminases or total bilirubin, treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA) and WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. - Other Immune-Mediated Disorders In addition to autoimmune hepatitis, immune-mediated disorders such as skin reactions, lymphadenopathy, and non-infectious colitis can occur in patients treated with ZINBRYTA. Overall, serious immune-mediated conditions were observed in 5% of patients treated with ZINBRYTA [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. - If a patient develops a serious immune-mediated disorder, consider stopping ZINBRYTA and refer the patient to a specialist to ensure comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment. Some patients required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant treatment for autoimmune hepatitis or other immune-mediated disorders and continued this treatment after the last dose of ZINBRYTA [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. Because of the risks of hepatic injury, including autoimmune hepatitis, and other immune-mediated disorders, ZINBRYTA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ZINBRYTA REMS Program [see Daclizumab is humanized [monoclonal antibody](https://www.rxlist.com/monoclonal_antibody/definition.htm) that binds subunit of the [interleukin-2](https://www.rxlist.com/interleukin-2/definition.htm) receptor (IL-2R, CD25). Daclizumab is composed of two humanized gamma-1 heavy chains and two humanized kappa light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 144 kilodaltons (kDa). ZINBRYTA injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution for subcutaneous use in a single-dose prefilled syringe. Each mg); and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is 6.0. INDICATIONS ZINBRYTA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of [multiple sclerosis](https://www.rxlist.com/multiple_sclerosis_ms_medications/drugs-condition.htm) (MS). Because of its safety profile, the use of ZINBRYTA should generally be reserved for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosing Information The recommended dosage of ZINBRYTA is 150 milligrams injected subcutaneously once monthly [see Assessment Prior to Initiating ZINBRYTA and Laboratory Testing and Monitoring to Assess Safety after Initiating ZINBRYTA]. Instruct patients to inject a missed dose as soon as possible but no more than two weeks late. After two weeks, skip the missed dose and take the next dose on schedule. Administer only one dose at a time. Important Administration Instructions ZINBRYTA is for subcutaneous use only. Train patients in the proper technique for self-administering subcutaneous injections using the prefilled autoinjector or syringe. Thirty minutes prior to injection, remove ZINBRYTA from the refrigerator to allow the drug to warm to room temperature. Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm ZINBRYTA. Do not place ZINBRYTA back into the refrigerator after allowing it to warm to room temperature [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling]. [Parenteral](https://www.rxlist.com/parenteral/definition.htm) drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. ZINBRYTA is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution. Do not use ZINBRYTA if it is cloudy or there are visible particles. Sites for injection include the thigh, abdomen, and back of the upper arm. Use each prefilled autoinjector or syringe one time and then place in a sharps disposal container for disposal according to community guidelines [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling]. Assessment Prior To Initiating ZINBRYTA Hepatic Assessment Prior to initiating ZINBRYTA, obtain levels. Initiation of ZINBRYTA is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease or hepatic impairment including ALT or AST at least 2 times the ULN [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CI)and WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. Assessment For Tuberculosis And Other Infections - Evaluate patients at high risk for [tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculosis/definition.htm)infection prior to initiating treatment with ZINBRYTA [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. For patients testing positive for tuberculosis, treat tuberculosis by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ZINBRYTA. - Avoid initiating ZINBRYTA in patients with tuberculosis or other severe active infection [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. - Prior to initiation of ZINBRYTA, screen patients for [Hepatitis B](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_b/definition.htm)and C. ZINBRYTA is [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CI)]. Vaccinations Because [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) with live [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) is not recommended during treatment and up to 4 months after discontinuation of treatment, consider any necessary [immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm) with live vaccines prior to treatment with ZINBRYTA [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. Laboratory Testing And Monitoring To Assess Safety After Initiating ZINBRYTA Conduct the following laboratory tests at periodic intervals to monitor for early signs of potentially serious adverse effects: Liver Tests Test transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly and assess before the next dose of ZINBRYTA. Follow transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly for 6 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. As shown in Table 1, interruption or discontinuation of ZINBRYTA therapy is recommended for management of certain liver test abnormalities [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. Table 1: ZINBRYTA Treatment Modification for Liver Test Abnormalities |Elevated Transaminases and/or Total Bilirubin [see WARNINGS AND | OR Total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN OR ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3 but less than 5 times ULN and total bilirubin greater than 1.5 but less than 2 times ULN - Interrupt ZINBRYTA therapy and investigate for other etiologies of abnormal lab value(s). - If no other etiologies are identified, then discontinue ZINBRYTA. - If other etiologies are identified, re-assess the overall risk-benefit profile of ZINBRYTA in the patient and consider whether to resume ZINBRYTA when both AST or ALT are less than 2 times ULN and total bilirubin is less than or equal to ULN. ULN = upper limit of normal HOW SUPPLIED Dosage Forms And Strengths Injection: 150 mg/mL solution in a single-dose is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution.

Manufactured by: Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA 02142. Revised: May 2017 SIDE EFFECTS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: - Hepatic Injury [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)] - [see AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)] - Acute Hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)] - Infections [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)] - Depression and Suicide [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of ZINBRYTA cannot be directly compared with rates in clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In all controlled and uncontrolled trials performed in patients with relapsing multiple [sclerosis](https://www.rxlist.com/sclerosis/definition.htm), 2236 patients received ZINBRYTA for a total of 5214 person-years. Of these patients, 1576 received ZINBRYTA for at least 1 year, 1259 for at least 2 years, and 888 for at least 3 years. In the controlled studies, approximately 67% were female, 92% were Caucasian, and the mean age was 36 years at study entry. In the active-controlled study (Study 1), 919 patients received ZINBRYTA (150 mg SQ, every 4 weeks) and 922 patients received AVONEX (interferon beta-1a 30 mcg IM, weekly) for a minimum of 2 years and up to 3 years, with 1952 person-years of exposure to ZINBRYTA; the median length of treatment was approximately 27 months. The adverse reactions from Study 1 are presented in Table 2. In the placebo-controlled study (Study 2), 417 patients received ZINBRYTA with 423 person-years of exposure, of which 208 received 150 mg, and 204 received placebo every 4 weeks for up to 1 year; the median length of treatment was approximately 11 months. The adverse reactions from Study 2 are presented in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 5% and at least 2% higher incidence than comparator) that occurred in ZINBRYTA-treated patients were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, [influenza](https://www.rxlist.com/influenza/definition.htm), oropharyngeal pain, [bronchitis](https://www.rxlist.com/bronchitis/definition.htm), [eczema](https://www.rxlist.com/eczema/definition.htm), and [lymphadenopathy](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphadenopathy/definition.htm) compared with AVONEX; and upper respiratory tract infection, depression, rash, [pharyngitis](https://www.rxlist.com/pharyngitis/definition.htm), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) compared with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in up to 5% of patients treated with ZINBRYTA were hepatic events including elevations of serum transaminases and [cutaneous](https://www.rxlist.com/cutaneous/definition.htm) events. Patients were excluded from the clinical studies for abnormal laboratory values including [hemoglobin](https://www.rxlist.com/hemoglobin/definition.htm), [complete blood count](https://www.rxlist.com/complete_blood_count/definition.htm) with differential, serum transaminases, or serum creatinine. Patients were excluded if they had a history of [seizure](https://www.rxlist.com/seizure/definition.htm) disorder or of having a seizure within 6 months of beginning the study, or suicidal ideation or severe depression within 3 months of beginning the study. During Study 1, concomitant use of ZINBRYTA with the [hepatotoxic](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatotoxic/definition.htm) drugs valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, isoniazid, and [propylthiouracil](https://www.rxlist.com/propylthiouracil_ptu/definition.htm) was not permitted except in patients already receiving the drugs at the time of study entry. In clinical studies, serum chemistry was evaluated at baseline and monthly. [Hematology](https://www.rxlist.com/hematology/definition.htm) was evaluated at baseline, monthly for 6 months, and then every 3 months. [Thyroid](https://www.rxlist.com/thyroid/definition.htm) function was measured at baseline and every 6 months. Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Adults with RMS with an Incidence at Least 2% More for ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks than AVONEX 30 mcg IM Once Weekly (Study 1) |Adverse Reaction||ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks | N=919 % |AVONEX 30 mcg IM Once Weekly | respiratory tract infection and viral upper respiratory tract infection | 2 includes erythematous rash, exfoliative rash, macular rash, maculopapular rash, papular rash, pruritic rash, nummular eczema Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Adults with RMS with an Incidence at Least 2% More for ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks than Placebo (Study 2) |Adverse Reaction||ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks | N=208 % |Placebo | 2 includes erythematous rash, exfoliative rash, macular rash, maculopapular rash, papular rash, pruritic rash, relevant adverse reactions observed at <2% difference included abnormal liver function test, decreased lymphocyte count, diarrhea, dry skin, tract infection, skin exfoliation, toxic skin eruption, and viral infection. Seizures In Study 1, seizures occurred in 1% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients, compared with 0.3% of AVONEX-treated patients. In Study 2, no seizures occurred in either treatment group. Immune-Mediated Disorders Types of immune-mediated or autoimmune conditions that were observed in 2 or more ZINBRYTA-treated patients include type I diabetes, celiac disease, [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. The relationship of these events to ZINBRYTA is unknown. Breast Cancer In controlled studies, 1 ZINBRYTA-treated woman developed [breast cancer](https://www.rxlist.com/breast_cancer/definition.htm) compared with none in the AVONEX-treated group. Across all controlled and open-label clinical studies, 8 of 1485 (0.5%) ZINBRYTA-treated women developed breast cancer, and 1 of 751 (0.1%) ZINBRYTA-treated men developed breast cancer. It is unclear whether this represents an incidence increase over background rate. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In Study 1, patients were tested for anti-drug (daclizumab) antibodies at Week 4 and approximately every 3 months thereafter. Anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were observed in 19% (175/913) and 8% (71/913) of patients, respectively. Anti-drug antibody responses were transient in 12% (110/913) of patients and persistent in 7% (65/913) of patients. Anti-drug and neutralizing antibody responses predominantly occurred during the first year of treatment, and their frequency declined with continued ZINBRYTA treatment. In patients with neutralizing antibodies, daclizumab clearance was increased on average by 19% [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CP)]. There was no apparent correlation of anti-drug antibody or neutralizing antibody development to clinical response, adverse reactions, or pharmacodynamic profile of ZINBRYTA. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to daclizumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. DRUG INTERACTIONS Hepatotoxic Drugs Caution should be used when using hepatotoxic drugs, including non-prescription products, concomitantly with ZINBRYTA. Carefully consider the need for the use of herbal products or dietary supplements that can cause hepatotoxicity [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Injury ZINBRYTA can cause life-threatening severe liver injury, including [liver failure](https://www.rxlist.com/liver_failure/definition.htm) and [autoimmune hepatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/autoimmune_hepatitis/definition.htm). In controlled studies, serious drug-related hepatic injury occurred in 0.7% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 0.4% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 1.0% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with no injury in placebo patients (Study 2). Across all clinical studies (controlled and open-label), serious drug-related hepatic injury occurred in 1% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients, with monthly monitoring of transaminases and total bilirubin. The incidence of discontinuation due to drug related hepatic injury was 5% in ZINBRYTA-treated patients and 4% in AVONEX-treated patients. Autoimmune Hepatitis Across all clinical studies (controlled and open-label), 0.3% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients developed [autoimmune](https://www.rxlist.com/autoimmune/definition.htm) [hepatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis/definition.htm). One fatal case of autoimmune hepatitis occurred in a patient re-initiating ZINBRYTA after a planned 6 month treatment interruption period. This patient subsequently received two doses of ZINBRYTA in the presence of persisting alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Transaminase And Total Bilirubin Elevations The incidence of increases in hepatic transaminases was greater in patients taking ZINBRYTA than in those taking AVONEX or placebo. The incidence of ALT or AST elevations above 5 times the ULN was 6% in ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 3% in AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and 4% in ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 1% in patients on placebo (Study 2). Less than 1% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients had ALT or AST greater than 20 times the ULN. Elevations of hepatic transaminases of at least 3 times the ULN combined with elevated bilirubin at least 2 times the ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times the ULN occurred in 0.7% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 0.1% of AVONEX-treated patients. In clinical trials, serum transaminase elevations occurred during treatment and up to 4 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. Monitoring Prior to starting treatment with ZINBRYTA, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CI)]. Test transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly and assess before the next dose of ZINBRYTA. Follow transaminase levels and total bilirubin monthly for 6 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. Treatment modifications are recommended based on serum transaminase and total bilirubin values [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)]. If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, [anorexia](https://www.rxlist.com/anorexia/definition.htm), or [jaundice](https://www.rxlist.com/jaundice/definition.htm) and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with ZINBRYTA, as appropriate. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes, such as infection, and a specialist should evaluate the patient [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)]. Discontinue ZINBRYTA if autoimmune hepatitis is suspected. Treatment of autoimmune hepatitis with systemic corticosteroids and other [immunosuppressant](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppressant/definition.htm) drugs may be required. Some patients may need long-term [immunosuppression](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppression/definition.htm). Risk Of Hepatic Injury With Concomitant Use Of Other Hepatotoxic Drugs Caution should be used when using hepatotoxic drugs, including non-prescription products, concomitantly with ZINBRYTA. Also, carefully consider the need for the use of herbal products or dietary supplements that can cause hepatotoxicity [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DI)]. Immune-Mediated Disorders Treatment with ZINBRYTA increases the risk of immune-mediated disorders, including autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune hepatitis. Across all clinical studies (controlled and open-label), immune-mediated disorders occurred in 28% of patients on ZINBRYTA, the most common of which were skin reactions and lymphadenopathy. In the active-control study (Study 1), immune-mediated disorders were observed in 32% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 12% for AVONEX-treated patients. In Study 1, serious immune-mediated disorders were observed in 4% of patients treated with ZINBRYTA compared with less than 1% for AVONEX-treated patients. In the placebo-control study (Study 2), immune-mediated disorders were observed in 13% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 7% of placebo-treated patients. In Study 2, serious immune-mediated disorders were observed in 0.5% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In some cases, patients had concurrent or sequential occurring disorders while taking ZINBRYTA. Some patients required invasive procedures for diagnosis (e.g., [colonoscopy](https://www.rxlist.com/colonoscopy/definition.htm), [liver biopsy](https://www.rxlist.com/liver_biopsy/definition.htm), kidney biopsy, lung biopsy), hospitalization for fluid replacement or [blood transfusion](https://www.rxlist.com/blood_transfusion/definition.htm), or prolonged treatment with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs. Some of these events did not resolve after stopping ZINBRYTA during study follow-up. Prescribers should be vigilant regarding emergent immune-mediated disorders. For suspected immune-mediated disorders, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm [etiology](https://www.rxlist.com/etiology/definition.htm) or to exclude other causes. If a patient develops a serious immune-mediated disorder, consider stopping ZINBRYTA and refer the patient to an appropriate specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Skin Reactions ZINBRYTA causes skin reactions. In clinical trials, skin reactions occurred in 37% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 19% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 18% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 13% of patients on placebo (Study 2). Skin reactions occurred at any time during treatment with ZINBRYTA. Rashes occurred in 11% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared to 4% of AVONEX-treated patients, and in 7% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared to 3% of patients on placebo. Dermatitis occurred more frequently in ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared to AVONEX-treated patients or to patients on placebo, and eczema was observed more frequently in ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared to AVONEX-treated patients [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#AR)]. Psoriatic occurred compared with 0.3% of AVONEX-treated patients. [Photosensitivity](https://www.rxlist.com/photosensitivity/definition.htm) also occurred. Serious skin reactions occurred in 2% of patients treated with ZINBRYTA compared with 0.1% of patients on AVONEX (Study 1) and in 1% of patients treated with ZINBRYTA compared with none treated with placebo (Study 2). One death resulted from infectious complications following a serious cutaneous reaction. In patients with a history of skin conditions, including eczema or [psoriasis](https://www.rxlist.com/psoriasis/definition.htm), use of ZINBRYTA may exacerbate those conditions. Treatment of skin reactions included treatment with topical or systemic steroids or immunosuppressant drugs, including tacrolimus. In clinical trials, discontinuation because of skin reactions was 4% in ZINBRYTA-treated patients. Rashes took a mean of 3 months to resolve, some were unresolved at the time of the last evaluation. If a patient develops a serious diffuse or inflammatory rash, it is recommended that a [dermatologist](https://www.rxlist.com/dermatologist/definition.htm) evaluate the patient before the next dose of ZINBRYTA. Discontinuation of ZINBRYTA may be appropriate. Lymphadenopathy ZINBRYTA increases the incidence of lymphadenopathy. In controlled studies, lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis occurred in 6% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 1% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 2% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients (Study 2). Onset of lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis occurred throughout the treatment period. Serious events related to lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis included infections, [benign](https://www.rxlist.com/benign/definition.htm) salivary and [interstitial](https://www.rxlist.com/interstitial/definition.htm) lung changes [see Infections]. The majority of cases resolved with or without continued treatment with ZINBRYTA and took a mean of 3 months to resolve. Lymphadenopathy resulted in discontinuation in 0.6 % of ZINBRYTA-treated patients. Some patients with lymphadenopathy underwent diagnostic biopsy. In the event that [lymph node](https://www.rxlist.com/lymph_node/definition.htm) biopsy is considered, full diagnostic evaluation should be conducted by a specialist. Non-Infectious Colitis An increased incidence of serious [colitis](https://www.rxlist.com/colitis/definition.htm) (less than 1%) was reported in patients treated with ZINBRYTA compared with none for patients treated with AVONEX or placebo in clinical trials. Consider referring patients who develop symptoms of colitis (e.g., abdominal pain, fever, prolonged diarrhea) to a specialist. Other Immune-Mediated Disorders A wide variety of other immune-mediated disorders, some serious, have occurred infrequently with the use of ZINBRYTA. These include single organ or systemic multi-organ inflammatory reactions. Many events occurred in only one patient, and the relationship to ZINBRYTA is unknown [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#AR)]. Some required treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Some required several months for [resolution](https://www.rxlist.com/resolution/definition.htm) after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. For suspected immune-mediated disorders, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or to exclude other causes. If a patient develops a serious immune-mediated disorder, consider stopping ZINBRYTA and refer the patient to an appropriate specialist for further evaluation and treatment. ZINBRYTA REMS Program ZINBRYTA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ZINBRYTA REMS Program, because of the risks of hepatic injury including autoimmune hepatitis, and other immune-mediated disorders [see Hepatic Injury and Immune-Mediated Disorders]. Notable requirements the ZINBRYTA REMS Program include the following: - Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. - Patients must enroll in the program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements [see Hepatic Injury and Immune-Mediated Disorders]. - Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive ZINBRYTA. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at 1-800-456-2255 Acute Hypersensitivity ZINBRYTA can cause [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm), [angioedema](https://www.rxlist.com/angioedema/definition.htm), and [urticaria](https://www.rxlist.com/urticaria/definition.htm) after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Discontinue and do not re-start ZINBRYTA if anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occur [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#CI)]. Infections ZINBRYTA increases the risk for infections. In controlled trials, infections occurred in 65% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 57% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 50% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 44% of patients taking placebo (Study 2). Serious infections occurred in 4% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 2% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 3% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with none on placebo (Study 2). The most common types of infections observed were upper respiratory tract infections, [urinary tract](https://www.rxlist.com/urinary_tract/definition.htm) infections and viral infections. In clinical trials, cases of tuberculosis occurred in countries where tuberculosis is [endemic](https://www.rxlist.com/endemic/definition.htm). Evaluate high-risk patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with ZINBRYTA. For patients testing positive for tuberculosis, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ZINBRYTA [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)]. Avoid initiating ZINBRYTA in patients with severe active infection until the infection is fully controlled. If serious infection develops, consider withholding treatment with ZINBRYTA until the infection resolves. Vaccinations The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during treatment with ZINBRYTA has not been studied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and up to 4 months after discontinuation of ZINBRYTA [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)]. Depression And Suicide Depression-related events occurred more frequently in patients receiving ZINBRYTA than in patients receiving AVONEX or placebo. In controlled trials, depression-related events occurred in 10% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 8% of AVONEX-treated patients (Study 1) and in 7% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients compared with 2% of patients taking placebo (Study 2). In Study 1, serious events related to depression, including suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, occurred in 0.4% of ZINBRYTA-treated patients and in 0.7% of AVONEX-treated patients. None occurred in Study 2 (placebo-controlled). Administer ZINBRYTA with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders. Advise patients and/or caregivers to immediately report any symptoms of new or worsening depression and/or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops severe depression and/or suicidal ideation, consider discontinuation of ZINBRYTA. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( [Medication Guide and Instructions for Use](/zinbryta-drug.htm#PI)). Hepatic Injury Inform the patient of the risk of severe hepatic injury associated with ZINBRYTA. Advise patients of the symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, and instruct patients to report such symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Discuss with the patient the importance of measuring hepatic laboratory values and having them evaluated by the health care provider monthly while taking ZINBRYTA and for up to 6 months after the last dose of ZINBRYTA. Discuss with the patient the risk of concomitant use of other hepatotoxic medications, over the counter medications, herbal products, or dietary supplements. Inform the patient that they will be given a ZINBRYTA Patient Wallet Card that they should carry with them at all times. This card describes symptoms which, if experienced, should prompt the patient to immediately seek medical evaluation. Advise the patient to show the ZINBRYTA Patient Wallet Card to other treating health care providers. Immune-Mediated Disorders Advise patients that ZINBRYTA can cause their immune system to attack healthy cells in their body and that this can affect any organ system. Skin Reactions Advise patients that ZINBRYTA can cause [dermatologic](https://www.rxlist.com/dermatologic/definition.htm) reactions that can range from mild rashes to serious reactions that could require treatment with other medications or result in hospitalization. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if dermatologic reactions occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Lymphadenopathy Inform patients that ZINBRYTA may cause lymphadenopathy that can range from mild events that can resolve on their own to serious lymphadenopathy that may require invasive procedures for diagnosis. Inform patients of the symptoms and instruct patients to contact their health care provider if they develop lymphadenopathy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Non-Infectious Colitis Inform patients that ZINBRYTA may cause [gastrointestinal](https://www.rxlist.com/gastrointestinal/definition.htm) reactions that may be serious and could require treatment. Advise patients of the symptoms of colitis and instruct patients to promptly contact their healthcare provider if they experience these symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. ZINBRYTA REMS Program ZINBRYTA is available only through a restricted program called the ZINBRYTA REMS Program [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Inform the patient of the following notable requirements: - Patients must enroll in the program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. ZINBRYTA is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Therefore, provide patients with the telephone number and website for information on how to obtain the product. Allergic Reactions And Anaphylaxis Advise patients of the symptoms of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, and instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Risk Of Infections Inform patients that they may be more likely to get infections when taking ZINBRYTA, and that they should contact their health care provider if they develop symptoms of infection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Depression And Suicide Advise patients of the symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation as they have occurred with the use of ZINBRYTA and instruct patients to report symptoms of depression or thoughts of suicide to their health care provider immediately [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Instructions For Self-Injection Technique And Procedures Provide appropriate instruction for methods of self-injection, including careful review of the ZINBRYTA Instructions for Use. Instruct the patient in the use of [aseptic](https://www.rxlist.com/aseptic/definition.htm) technique when administering ZINBRYTA. Inform the patient that a health care provider should show them or their caregiver how to inject ZINBRYTA before administering the first dose. Tell the patient not to re-use needles, pens or syringes, and instruct the patient on safe disposal procedures. Inform the patient to dispose of used needles, pens and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis The [carcinogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/carcinogenic/definition.htm) potential of ZINBRYTA has not been assessed. Mutagenesis Genetic [toxicology](https://www.rxlist.com/toxicology/definition.htm) studies of ZINBRYTA have not been conducted. Impairment Of Fertility ZINBRYTA (0, 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg) administered biweekly by subcutaneous injection to monkeys had no effect](https://www.rxlist.com/adverse_effect/definition.htm) male ( [sperm](https://www.rxlist.com/sperm/definition.htm) motility, concentration, and [morphology](https://www.rxlist.com/morphology/definition.htm) levels) or (estrus cycle length or estradiol/ [progesterone](https://www.rxlist.com/progesterone/definition.htm) patterns) fertility endpoints. At the highest dose tested, plasma exposures (AUC) in males and females were 100 and 85 times, respectively, that at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 150 mg. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of ZINBRYTA in pregnant women. Administration of ZINBRYTA to monkeys during gestation resulted in embryofetal death and reduced fetal growth at maternal exposures greater than 30 times that expected clinically [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm) in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data In monkeys administered ZINBRYTA (0, 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection during organogenesis (gestation days 20 through 50), there was a decrease in fetal body weight and [crown](https://www.rxlist.com/crown/definition.htm)-rump length, and an increase in embryofetal death at the highest dose tested. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose of 50 mg/kg was approximately 30 times that in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 150 mg. In monkeys administered ZINBRYTA (50 mg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection from gestation day 50 to birth, there were no effects on pre-or postnatal development for up to 6 months after birth. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the administered dose was 55 times that in humans at the RHD. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of daclizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Daclizumab was excreted in the milk of ZINBRYTA-treated monkeys. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ZINBRYTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZINBRYTA or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ZINBRYTA in patients less than 17 years old have not been established. Use of ZINBRYTA is not recommended in pediatric patients due to the risks of hepatic injury and immune-mediated disorders [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ZINBRYTA did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Hepatic Impairment Clinical trials did not include patients with ALT or AST more than two times the ULN. Patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment may be at increased risk for hepatotoxicity from ZINBRYTA [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA), provided. ZINBRYTA is contraindicated in patients with: - Pre-existing hepatic disease or hepatic impairment, including ALT or AST at least 2 times the ULN, because ZINBRYTA could exacerbate existing liver dysfunction [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/zinbryta-drug.htm#DAA)and WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. - A history of autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune condition involving the liver [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. - A history of hypersensitivity to daclizumab or any other components of the formulation. Use in such patients may result in anaphylaxis or life-threatening multi-organ hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#P)]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action The precise mechanism by which daclizumab exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown but is presumed to involve modulation of [IL-2](https://www.rxlist.com/il-2/definition.htm) mediated activation of lymphocytes through binding to CD25, a subunit of the high- [affinity](https://www.rxlist.com/affinity/definition.htm) IL-2 receptor. Pharmacodynamics During ZINBRYTA treatment, mean cell counts for the major immune subsets (T, B, and NK cells) remained within normal ranges. Total [lymphocyte](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphocyte/definition.htm), T and [B cell](https://www.rxlist.com/b_cell/definition.htm) counts decreased less than 10% from baseline during the first year of treatment. Total lymphocyte counts returned to baseline levels approximately 8-12 weeks after the last dose of ZINBRYTA (150 mg). Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ZINBRYTA are similar for healthy volunteers and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Absorption Following a single subcutaneous injection of ZINBRYTA, the maximum concentration occurred between 5 and 7 days. At steady state, daclizumab mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 30 g/mL, minimum serum concentration (Cmin) was 15 g/mL, and area under the serum concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) values were approximately 640 g-days per mL. The absolute bioavailability of 150 mg subcutaneous daclizumab was approximately 90%. After administration of ZINBRYTA 150 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, serum daclizumab concentrations reached steady state by the fourth dose. Daclizumab accumulated to a level approximately 2.5-fold compared with a single dose. The coefficient of variation between individual patients was approximately 35-40% for exposure (Cmax and AUC) and 27-51% for clearance and volume of distribution. Distribution In multiple sclerosis patients taking 150 mg subcutaneous doses of ZINBRYTA every 4 weeks, the estimated steady-state volume of distribution of daclizumab was approximately 6.34 liters. Metabolism And Elimination Because it is a protein, daclizumab is expected to undergo [catabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/catabolism/definition.htm) to peptides and [amino acids](https://www.rxlist.com/amino_acids/definition.htm) in the same manner as [endogenous](https://www.rxlist.com/endogenous/definition.htm) [IgG](https://www.rxlist.com/igg/definition.htm) proteins without renal elimination. The estimated clearance of daclizumab is 0.212 liters per day with an elimination half-life of 21 days. Daclizumab clearance in patients who developed neutralizing antibodies was 19% higher [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/zinbryta-drug.htm#AR)]. Specific Populations Clinical studies did not identify significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteers. Covariate analyses did not identify significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters based on gender, age, or weight for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Drug Interaction Studies ZINBRYTA 150 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 12 weeks in patients with multiple sclerosis did not significantly affect the systemic exposure of concomitantly administered oral midazolam (CYP3A substrate), warfarin substrate). Animal Toxicology And/Or Pharmacology There was a dose-dependent increase in microglial aggregates in the brain and [spinal cord](https://www.rxlist.com/spinal_cord/definition.htm) of monkeys at subcutaneous doses greater than 10 mg/kg administered biweekly for up to 39 weeks. Microglial aggregates were, in some animals, associated with microhemorrhage; however, no evidence of neuronal injury was observed. There was evidence of reversibility by 12 weeks after the last dose. Clinical Studies The efficacy of ZINBRYTA was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Both studies evaluated 150 mg of subcutaneous ZINBRYTA taken once every four weeks in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Study 1: Active-Controlled Trial In RMS Study 1 compared ZINBRYTA to 30 mcg weekly [intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm) doses of AVONEX in 1841 patients. The study included RMS patients who had either: 1) at least 2 relapses during the prior 3 years and at least one relapse in the year prior to [randomization](https://www.rxlist.com/randomization/definition.htm); or 2) one or more clinical relapses and one or more new T1 gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing or T2 hyperintense [MRI](https://www.rxlist.com/mri/definition.htm) lesions within the prior 2 years with at least one of these events in the prior 12 months. Patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis or an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater than 5 were excluded. Treatment continued for up to 144 weeks until the last enrolled patient completed 96 weeks of treatment. Clinical assessments were to occur every 12 weeks and after relapse events. MRI scans were performed at Week 24 and Week 96. The primary outcome measure of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Additional outcome measures included the proportion of patients relapsed, the proportion of patients who experienced confirmed disability progression, and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions. Confirmed disability progression was defined as at least a 1 point increase from baseline EDSS (1.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 0) sustained for 12 weeks. In Study 1, randomization assigned 919 patients to ZINBRYTA and 922 patients to AVONEX; 71% of ZINBRYTA-and 70% of AVONEX-treated patients completed at least 96 weeks of treatment with the assigned drug. At baseline, the mean age of patients was 36 years, the mean disease duration since diagnosis was 4.2 years, the mean EDSS score was 2.5, and the mean number of relapses in the prior year was 1.6. At baseline, 68% of patients were female, 46% of patients had MRI scans with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and 41% of patients had previously taken one or more non- [steroid](https://www.rxlist.com/steroid/definition.htm) treatments for MS. ZINBRYTA had a statistically significant effect on the annualized relapse rate and on the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions. There was no statistically significant effect on 12-week confirmed disability progression. Results for Study 1 are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1, below. Table 4: Clinical and MRI Results of Study 1 |ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks | N=919 |AVONEX 30 mcg |1 Values refer to up to144 weeks | 2 MRI analysis used evaluable dataset and values reflect results at 96 weeks Figure 1: Study 1 Percentage of Relapse-Free Patients In a subgroup analysis of Study 1, a reduction was observed compared with AVONEX on annualized relapse rate across patient subgroups (based on gender, age, prior multiple sclerosis disease modifying therapy, and disease activity levels). Study 2: Placebo-Controlled Trial In RMS Study 2 compared ZINBRYTA to placebo in 412 patients. The study included RMS patients who had experienced at least one relapse in the year prior to randomization or who had one or more T1 Gd-enhancing MRI lesions within 6 weeks of randomization. Patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis or an EDSS score greater than 5 were excluded. Treatment duration was 52 weeks. Clinical assessments were to occur every 12 weeks and after relapse events. MRI scans were performed at weeks 24, 36, and 52 in all patients and every 4 weeks in a subset of patients. The primary outcome measure of Study 2 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR) at Week 52. Additional outcome measures included new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions between Week 8 and Week 24, the proportion of patients relapsed, the proportion of patients who experienced 12week confirmed disability progression (as defined in Study 1) and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions. In Study 2, randomization assigned 208 patients to receive ZINBRYTA (150 mg) and 204 patients to receive placebo; 91% of ZINBRYTA patients and 91% of placebo patients completed treatment. At baseline, the mean age of patients was 36 years, the mean disease duration since diagnosis was 4.3 years, the mean EDSS score was 2.8, and the mean number of relapses in the prior year was 1.4. At baseline, 65% of patients were female, 48% of patients had MRI scans with T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and 21% of patients had previously taken one or more non-steroid treatments for MS. ZINBRYTA had a statistically significant effect on the annualized relapse rate, the proportion of patients relapse free, the number of new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions, and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions. The results for Study 2 are shown in Table 5. Table 5: Clinical and MRI Results of Study 2 |ZINBRYTA 150 mg SQ Every 4 Weeks Values refer to results at 52 weeks | 2 MRI analyses used evaluable dataset for each endpoint; T1 Gd-enhancing: MRI intensive population, between 8-24 weeks 3 The proportion of patients with 12-week confirmed disability progression was an exploratory measure in Study 2. As the proportion of patients with 12-week confirmed disability was used as a key secondary outcome in Study 1, and is one of the main outcome measures in MS studies, the disability progression results are presented for Study 2. The nominal p value for that comparison, p=0.02, is not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

If you have dropped your ZINBRYTA Pen or it looks damaged, throw it away (dispose) and get a new one. See \"Step 8: Dispose of your ZINBRYTA Pen\". Supplies needed for your ZINBRYTA Pen injection (See Figures A and B below): - 1 ZINBRYTA Pen (See Figure B) - 1 alcohol wipe - 1 gauze pad - 1 adhesive bandage - 1 sharps container for throwing away ZINBRYTA Pens. See \"Step 8: Dispose of your ZINBRYTA Pen\" Figure A Before Use - Parts of your ZINBRYTA Pen (See Figure B) Figure B Important: Do not remove the cap until you are ready to inject. If you remove the cap, do not recap the ZINBRYTA Pen. Recapping the ZINBRYTA Pen could cause it to lock. Before you prepare your injection, take your ZINBRYTA Pen out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. - Do not use external heat sources such as hot water to warm the ZINBRYTA Pen. Preparing for your injection Step 1: Collect your supplies and wash your hands - Find a well-lit area and a clean, flat surface, like a table, and collect all the supplies you will need to give yourself, or to receive an injection. - Wash your hands with soap and water and dry your hands well. Step 2: Check your ZINBRYTA Pen (See Figure C) - Check the injection status window. You should see green stripes. - Do not use if you do not see the green stripes in the injection status window. - Check the expiration date printed on your ZINBRYTA Pen. - Do not use ZINBRYTA Pen past the expiration date. - Check the medicine window on your ZINBRYTA Pen and make sure the ZINBRYTA medicine is colorless to slightly yellow. - Do not use ZINBRYTA Pen if the liquid is cloudy or has floating particles in it. Note: You might see air bubbles in the medicine window. This is normal and will not affect your dose. Figure C Step 3: Choose and clean your injection site - The ZINBRYTA Pen is used to inject ZINBRYTA under the skin only (subcutaneous). - ZINBRYTA should be injected into your thigh, abdomen, or the back of your upper arm (See Figure D). - Do not inject directly into your belly button. - Do not inject into an area of the body where the skin is irritated, tender, red, bruised, infected, scarred, or tattooed. - Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. Do not use the same injection site for each injection. - Choose an injection site and wipe your skin with an alcohol wipe. - Let the injection site dry on its own before injecting the dose. - Do not touch or blow on this area again before giving your injection. Figure D Giving Your Injection Step 4: Remove the ZINBRYTA Pen cap - Pull the pen cap straight off. Your ZINBRYTA Pen is now ready to inject. - Throw away the pen cap after your injection. Do not recap your ZINBRYTA Pen. This could lock the pen. - The needle is covered by the needle cover and the needle will not be seen (See Figure E). Do not clean or touch the needle cover in any way.
