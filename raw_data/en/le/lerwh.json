Meningitis is an infection of the tissue (called the \"meninges\") that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. What causes meningitis? Many different kinds of viruses and bacteria (germs) can cause meningitis. A sample of spinal fluid, usually collected by a spinal tap, is needed to find out if someone has meningitis and to see what caused it. What kinds of bacteria can cause meningitis? Neisseria meningitidis are bacteria that can cause illness in people of any age. At any time, about 5-15% of people have these bacteria in their throats or noses wit hout getting sick. The bacteria are spread through saliva (spit) during kissing, sharing of food, drinks or cigare ttes, and by close contact with infected people who are sneezing or coughing. People who have come in close contact with the saliva of a person with meningitis from this type of bacteria may have to get antibiotic s (medicine) for protection. Meningitis caused by these bacteria is called \"meningococcal.\" There are vaccines , which can be used to help prevent this kind of meningitis. Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria, called Hib, can also cause meningitis. There is a vaccine called \"Hib vaccine\" that prevents infants and young children from getting Hib disease. Most adults are resistant to this type of meningitis, and thanks to the vaccine, most children under 5 years of age are protected. Certain people who have come in close contact with the saliva of a person with meningitis from this type of bacteria may have to get an antibiotic for protection. Streptococcu s pneumoniae are bacteria that cause lung and ear inf ections but can also cause \"pneumococcal\" meningitis. These bacteria are usually found in the throat. Most people who have these bacteria in their throats stay healthy. However, people with chronic me dical problems or with weakened immune systems, and those who are very young or very old, are at higher risk for getting pne umococcal meningitis. Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is not spread from person-to-person. People in close contact with someone who has pneumococcal mening itis do not need to get antibiotics. Other bacteria can also cause meningitis, but meningitis from these other bacteria is much less common and usually not contagious. What about viruses? Viral meningitis, also called aseptic me ningitis, is much more common than bacterial meningitis. A group of viruses called enteroviruses is the most common cause of viral meningitis. These viruses are found in the throat and feces (stool) of infected people. The virus is most likely to be spread when people do not wash their hands after using the toilet or changing a diaper or soiled sheets, then touch their own mouths, prepare food for others, or touch others with their contaminated hands. These viruses can also be spread by the kind of close face-to-face contact that is common in families. Many enteroviruses don't cause people to feel very si ck. Others m ay cause only mild diarrhea or vomiting. People with viral meningitis are usually less sick than people with bacterial meningitis. They usually get better on their own. People who are close contacts of vira l meningitis patients do not need to be treated with antibiotics. However, they should wash their hands of ten with soap and warm water or use alcohol-based hand rubs or gels to stop the spread of these viruses. There are usually more cases of viral meningitis in the late summer and early fall. What are the symptoms of meningitis? Symptoms of meningitis may appear suddenly. Fever, sev ere and constant headache, stiff neck or neck pain, nausea and vomiting, and rash can all be signs of me ningitis. Changes in behavior such as confusion, sleepiness, and trouble waking up can also be importa nt symptoms. In some infants, the only signs of meningitis may be crankiness or tiredness and poor feedi ng. Babies with meningitis usually run a fever, but not always. Anyone who has or observes these symptoms should contact a health care provider right away. How is meningitis spread? Many of the viruses that cause meningitis are spread thr ough saliva (spit) or feces (stool). The bacteria that can cause meningitis are usually spread from person-to-p erson through contact with infected saliva. Most people may already have immunity (natural protection) against many of these germs. How can meningitis be prevented? If a person is exposed to the saliva of someone with me ningitis caused by certain types of bacteria, public health officials or your health care provider may recommend an antibiotic to prevent disease. Frequent handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand rubs or gels can help stop the spread of many viruses and bacteria. Not sharing food, drinks, or eating utensils with other people can also help stop the spread of germs. There are 5 vaccines that can help prevent meningitis: Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) vaccine is usually gi ven at 2, 4 , 6 and between 12 and 15 months of age. The total number of doses depends on the age at whic h the series was begun. Children over 5 years of age usually do not need this vaccine. But, some older children or adults with special health conditions should get it. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13-valent (PCV13) is recommended for all children less than 24 months old and in certain high-risk children between the ages of 24 and 59 months. It is usually given at 2, 4, 6, and between 12 and 15 months of age. The total number of doses depends on the age at which the series was begun. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23-valent (PPV23) is used in hig h-risk individuals 2 years of age or older. (High-risk children less than 5 years of age should also receive PCV13.) This vaccine is also recommended for everyone 65 years of age and older. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine protects against 4 types of the 1 3 serogroups (subgroups) of N. meningitidis that cause serious disease. It is licensed for use in people 2 years of age and older. Meningococcal vaccine is thought to provide protection for approximately 5 years. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine also protects against 4 t ypes of the 13 serogroups (subgroups) of N. meningitidis that cause serious disease. It is approved for use in people 11-55 years of age. Meningococcal vaccine is thought to provide protection for approximately 5 years. Meningococcal vaccine is recommended for children 11- 12 years of age. Now, students 16-18 years of age should receive a booster dose or their first dose if they have not yet been vaccinated. College freshman and other newly enrolled college students living in dormitories who are not yet vaccinated are also recommended to receive meningococcal vacci ne. Meningococcal vaccine and booster doses are recommended for high-risk groups including anyone w ith a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed, those with persistent complement component deficiency (an inherited immune disorder), HIV infection, those traveling to countries where meningoc occal disease is very common, microbiologists and people who may have been exposed to meningococcal disease during an outbreak. Where can I get more information about meningitis? Your health care provider The Massachusetts Department of Publi c Health, Divi sion of Epidemiology and Immunization at (617) 983- 6800 or toll-free at (888) 658-2850 or on the MDPH website at http://www.mass.gov/dph Your local health department (lis ted in the phone book under government) August 2011 Information about Meningococcal Disease and Vaccination and Waiver for Students at Resi dential Schools and Colleges Revised legislation in Massachusetts now requires all newly enrolled full-time students attending a secondary school (e.g., boarding schools) or postsecondary institution (e.g., college s) who will be living in a dormitory or other congregate housing licensed or approved by the se condary school or institution to: 1. receive meningococcal vaccine; or 2. fall within one of the exemptions in the law, whic h are discussed on the reverse side of this sheet. The law provides an exemption for stud ents signing a waiver that reviews the dangers of meningococcal disease and indicates that the vaccination has been declined. To qualify for th is exemption, you are requir ed to review the information below and sign the waiver at the end of this document. Please not e, if a student is under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must be given a copy of this document and must sign the waiver. What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is caused by infection with bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis . These bacteria can infect the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord called the \"meni nges\" and cause meningitis, or they can infect the blood or other body organs. In the United St ates, about 2,600 people each year get m eningococcal disease and 10-15% die despite receiving antibiotic treatment. Of those who live, another 11-19% lose their arms or legs, become deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, become mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. How is meningococcal disease spread? These bacteria are passed from person-to-person through saliv a (spit). You must be in close contact with a n infected person's saliva in order for the bacteria to spread. Close contact includes activities such as kissing, sharing water bottles, sharing eating/drinking utensils or sharing cigarettes with someone who is infected; or being within 3-6 feet of someone who is infected and is coughing or sneezing. Who is at most risk for getting meningococcal disease? People who travel to certain parts of the world where the disease is very common are at risk, as are military recruits who live in close quarters. Children and adults with damaged or removed spleens or an inherited disorder called \"terminal complement component deficiency\" are at higher risk. People w ho live in settings such as college dormitories are also at greater risk of infection. Are some students in college and secondary schools at risk for meningococcal disease? College freshmen living in residence halls or dormitories are at an increa sed risk for meningococcal disease as compared to individuals of the same age not attending college. The setting, combined with risk behaviors (such as alcohol consumption, exposure to cigarette smoke, sharing food or beverages, and activities involving the exchange of saliva), may be what puts college students at a greater risk for infe ction. There is insufficient information about whether new students in other congregate living situations (e.g., residentia l schools) may also be at increased risk for meningococcal disease. But, the similarity in t heir environments and some behaviors may increase their risk. The risk of meningococcal disease for other college students, in particular ol der students and students who do not live in congregate housing, is not increased. However, meningococcal vaccine is a safe and efficacious way to reduce their risk of contracting this disease. Is there a vaccine against meningococcal disease? Yes, there are currently 2 vaccines available that protect against 4 of the most common of the 13 serogroups (subgroups) of N. meningitidis that cause serious disease. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is approved for use in those 2 years of age and older and meningococcal conjugate vaccine is approved for use in those 11-55 years of age. Both types of meningococcal vaccines are acceptable for college students and residential school students 11 years of age and older. For those younger than 11 years of age, meningococcal polysac charide vaccine is the only licensed vaccine. Both of the vaccines provide protection against four serogroups of t he bacteria, called groups A, C, Y and W-135. These four serogroups account for approximately two-thirds of the cases that occur in the U.S. each year. Most of the remaining one- third of the cases are caused by serogroup B, which is not cont ained in the vaccine. Protection from immunization with the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not lifelong; it la sts about 3 to 5 years in healthy adults (some people may be protected longer.) The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is expected to help decrease disease transmission and provide more long-term protection. (See reverse side) Is the meningococcal vaccine safe? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems such as severe allergic reactions. The risks associated with receiving the vaccine are much less significant than the risks that would arise in a case of meningococcal disease. Getting meningococcal vaccine is much safer t han getting the disease. Some people who get meningococcal vaccine have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. These symptoms usually last for 1-2 days. A small percentage of people who rece ive the vaccine develop a fever. The vaccine can be given to pregnant women. A few cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), a rare but serious nervous system disorder, have been reported among people who received meningococcal conjugate vaccine. This info rmation is still being evaluated by health officials. An ongoing risk of serious meningococcal disease exists. At this time, experts continue to recommend vaccination for those at increased risk of acquiring meningococcal disease. Howe ver, persons who have had GBS should generally not receive meningococcal conjugate vaccine, and should talk to thei r doctor about their other options for vaccination. Is it mandatory for students to receive meningococcal vaccine for entry into secondary schools or colleges that provide or license housing? Massachusetts law (MGL Ch. 76, s.15D) requires newly enrol led full-time stu dents attending a secondary school (those schools with grades 9-12) or postsecondary institution (e.g., co lleges) who will be living in a dormitory or other congregate housing licensed or approved by the secondary school or in stitution to receive mening ococcal vaccine. At affected secondary schools, the requirements apply to all new full-time residential students, regardless of grade (including grades pre-K through 8) and year of study. All students covered by t he regulations must provide do cumentation of having received a dose of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine within the last 5 years (or a dose of meningo coccal conjugate vaccine at any time in the past), unless they qualify for one of the exem ptions allowed by the law. Wh enever possible, immunizations should be obtained prior to enrollment or registration. Howeve r, students may be enrolled or registered provided that the required immunizations are obtained within 30 days of registration. Students may begin classes without a certific ate of immunization against meningococ cal disease if: 1) the student has a letter from a physician stating that there is a medical reason why he/she can't rece ive the vaccine; 2) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if t he student is a minor) presents a statement in writing that such vaccination is against his/her sincere religious belief; or 3) the student (or the stude nt's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) signs the waiver below stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the information provided and: a) elected to decline the va ccine; or b) could not obtain meningococcal vaccine due to a shortage, but wishes to receive vaccine (as indicated below). Where can a student get vaccinated? Students and their parents should contact their health care provider and make an appointment to discuss meningococcal disease, the benefits and risks of vaccin ation, and the availability of this vaccine. Schools and college health services are not required to provide you with this vaccine. Where can I get more information? Your healthcare provider The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Divi sion of Epidemiology and Immunization at (617) 983-6800 or www.mass.gov/dph Your local health department (listed in the phone book under government) Waiver for Meningococcal Vaccination Requirement I have received and reviewed the information provided on the ri sks of meningococcal disease and the risks and benefits of meningococcal vaccine.
