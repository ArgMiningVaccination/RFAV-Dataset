Lauren has channeled her gifts as a shamanic healer & intuitive energy therapist, working with all elements of the mind-body-spirit. A seemly incidental reawakening into the world of healing arts, led Lauren to leave the path of becoming a Naturopath to further develop her natural abilities as a healing guide and health coach. Through intention and practice she found herself invited into sacred ceremonies with some of the most private and revered traditions of the healing/shamanic arts. As she further delved into her healing path she began receiving invitations into sacred Native American ceremonies as the only anglo female with various multiple Native tribes, journeying in Ceremony with Sacred Plant Medicine, to staying with one of the most remote ancient Olmec tribes deep in the Oaxacan jungle, to again being personally invited into council & teachings with the [Venerable Lama Pema Khalsang of the Tibetan Buddist tradition](http://www.innerawakening.co/inner-awakening/) (recognized by the U.N. as an \"Outstanding Women of Buddism\") then receiving the sacred tradition of Cacao Ceremony by the ancient Mayan Qu'che tribes of the Guatemalan Highlands. Always receiving a genuine invitation to learn these ancient tradition without monetary but only energetic exchange. Lauren deeply recognizes her divine dharma as a channel for purpose of fully awakening the divinity, joy of high health and activating the Self-healer in others as well. On top of these divine immersions into authentic traditions of the ancient healing arts, Lauren has now also received over 2000+ hrs of formal training with some of the most renowned teachers in their fields of sound healing, energy healing, and yoga therapy. Including but not exclusive to John Beaulieu (Renown Scientist, Researcher, Author, Sound Healer), Mark Whitwell (Teacher, Author, TKV Desikachar lineage), Kamini Desai (PhD. Teacher, direct descendant of the Amrit Desai Yoga Nidra lineage), Gary Strauss (MS, RPP, PWE). Red Tent and Breath Work teachings with Shiva Rea, Dana Dharma Devi, Mary Bruce, Michal Brian Baker, and numerous other Master teachers and practitioners. Prior to her reawakening towards the end of her bachelor's of Health Science, she began rediscovering the life-changing benefits of working with the unconscious and conscious energetic fields to help her relieve stress, depression, and mental/emotional exhaustion. Since then she has traveled the world studying, teaching, working for, and collaborating with some of the most notorious communities in the healing arts. She has to date helped organize and facilitated healing therapy at some of the leading consciousness festivals/conferences/retreats such as the Bhakti Fest in Joshua Tree, Firefly Gathering, Ancient Future, Portal to the New Earth Sound Healing Festival, Tribalize Regenerative Living Summit, Full Moon Festivals, Mystical Yoga Farm Retreats, Teacher Trainings and more. Lauren's passion for serving others through the healing arts is only matched by her continual drive to understand the world of health through the modern lens of scientific research and data. Lauren holds a B.S. Health Science as she finished her pre-requisites for moving into a Naturopathic Medicine degree. However, as she completed her bachelor's she continued independent study and mentorship from folk as well as formal board-certified Naturopathic Doctors (ND, the natural alternative to MD). Her studies, as well as her ND mentors, showed her that these fields are still governed by very limiting bodies that keep their help limited to regulation/liability/heavy-debt that drives up their costs without being justified in the most effective avenues of Holistic therapy with overhead costs that make a more hands-on healing approach mostly unavailable. However, through Lauren's unique blend of scientifically-backed training in the Health Sciences, Yoga Therapy, Body Energetics, Somatic Body Therapy, and Board Certified Massage Therapy she has a very solid grasp of body mechanics and human anatomy. This foundation complemented with ancient meridian energetics, chakras, and source point awareness adds to her already profound intuitive ability to find imbalances in the body-energetic field and how to reintegrate these blocks/imbalances. She works with her clients where they are as there are so many tools to use when helping her clients recover, rehab, or optimize their body-mind-emotions. If clients are open and seeking a more energetic approach she has a plethora of scientifically researched ancient healing therapies or if a client feels more comfortable with a strictly modern western approach she is equally equipped and trained in both arenas. Lauren values both sides of the spectrum and is always eager to share her knowledge as well as studies in research-backed by science or first-hand experience with her clients in ways that are accessible to each individual's unique needs. Charged with so much passion and drive Lauren is on her path to developing her own methodology for helping practitioners offer their clients genuinely life-changing body-mind-soul therapies. As she believes health is accessible to everybody equipt with the right information, tools, and assistance then all things are truly possible. \"I love working one-on-one and in workshops with clients to help us all grow together in a new paradigm of high vibrational living and health that we all deserve. My philosophy with clients is to find a path to healing and optimal health that serves You as a completely unique individual.\" \"I am here to help guide and assist all souls ready to embrace higher states of physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. All things are truly possible when we open ourselves up to receiving, I am here to help you align and move to the next level of "}
