EURACTIV Romania reports. In the last year, 4,800 cases of measles were reported in Romania. Stocks of the MMR vaccine are running out and the country's government has decided to take emergency measures. According to a statement released by the Romanian health ministry, seen by Agerpres, the Commission's decision comes following a request by Minister for Health Florian Bodog. \"In view of the measles epidemic our country is facing and the discontinuity of compulsory vaccine supply for the vaccination calendar, on 27 April, the Romanian authorities notified the European Commission of a draft order suspending vaccine exports,\" the statement revealed. Romania in public health scare A severe digestive infection has struck infants and children in Romania, with two fatalities recorded so far. Bucharest hopes these are not the first days of a serious public health crisis. EURACTIV Romania reports. It added that \"after examining the draft legislative act, the European Commission decided that, in this particular case, the request to adopt emergency procedures is justified\". HotNews.ro recently reported that nearly 4,000 doses of measles vaccine have been taken off the Romanian market for export purposes in the last three weeks, according to data provided by pharmaceutical distributors. Bodog insisted that he would take all necessary steps to ensure that Romanian patients can benefit from the vaccine, as well as other medicines and treatments. \"Unfortunately, although the measles epidemic was announced a year ago, the health ministry at the time did not take appropriate action and did not stock enough vaccine to supply areas where the product ran out,\" the minister added in the statement.
