However, the precise mechanisms by which JTT could favorably modifythe clinical conditions of cancer patients are not well defined. The present study, therefore, wasundertaken to examine the possible mechanisms of JTT on prevention of cancer metastasisusing experimental mouse model. JTT was well mixed with rodent chow at concentrationsof either 0.2 or 1.0%, and administered orally ad libitum , which was started 1 week before tumor cell injection and continue throughout the experiment. Oral administration of JTT atconcentration 0.2 and 1.0% into C57BL/6 male mice significantly inhibited tumor metastasis inlungs, which was induced by the intravenous injection of 2 /C210 5B16 melanoma cell. JTT at a concentration of 1.0% also significantly suppressed lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cell from hind footpad in C57BL/6 mice. In the second part of experiments, the influence of thedepression of natural killer (NK) cell, natural killer T (NKT) cell and several types of cytokineson JTT-mediated inhibition of tumor cell metastasis. Intraperitoneal injection of GM1 antibody against anti to NKT abrogated lung melanoma cells. Although intraperitoneal administration of anti-IFN- gmAb scarcely affected the inhibitory action of JTT on tumor cell metastasis, injection of amrinone, which used for IL-12 suppression, significantlydecreased the ability of JTT to prevent tumor cell metastasis. These results strongly suggest thatoral administration of JTT caused increase in the production of IL-12, which is responsiblefor the activation of both NK cell and NKT cell, in the lungs and results in inhibition of B16melanoma cell metastasis in the lungs. Keywords: herbal medicine - IFN- g- IL-12 - Juzen-Taiho-To - NK cell - NKT cell Digestive cancer patients generally undergo surgical therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of these treatments. While the effects of these treatments are significant, it is a fact that most patients suffer fromside-effects, such as high fever, general fatigue, loss of appetite, pancytopenia and many kinds of infections. In Japan and China, herbal medicine is used as a supplemental therapy for many kinds of chronic diseasessuch as loss of appetite, anemia and chilliness of the arms and legs with remarkable success (1,2). Recent reportsclearly showed that when herbal medicines are used for cancer treatment, many patients experience fewer or diminished side-effects induced by western medicine, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the survivalperiod is longer (3,4). It is also reported that herbalmedicine can prevent the progression of colon carcinoma, gastric and breast cancer as well as the prevention of these cancer metastasis in liver, lung or bone (3,4). Moreover, hepatocellular carcinoma has been shownto become smaller without severe side-effects (5).

The immune system of vertebrates is composed of two major arms: innate immunity and adoptive immunity. Innate immunity provides a swift response to agents prior to the initiation of adoptive immune responses. Theinnate response is almost immediate and is based on cells and soluble mediators that recognize common molecular patterns on pathogenic bacteria and trans- formed cells. Cells involved in the innate immune responses include several types of cells, such as macro-phages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells. In these phagocytic cells, NK and NKT cells play essential roles in tumorimmunology: NK cells have killer activating receptors and cause lysis of target cells using specific enzymes, perforin and granzymes (6). NKT cells, which are cyto-toxic cells that have characteristics of both NK cells and T cells, play a role in searching for tumor cells, so called immune surveillance, and in preventing metastasis (7).From these reports, it is reasonable to speculate that oral administration of herbal medicine in cancer patients enhance the activity of NK and NKT cells and resultsin both prevention of cancer metastasis and favorable modification of clinical conditions of the patients. However, there is no evidence showing that herbalmedicine can enhance the function of both NK and NKT cells in vivo . The present study, therefore, was undertaken to examine the influence of herbal medicineon NK and NKT cells using Juzen-Taiho-To (JTT) and experimental cancer metastatic model in mice. Methods Mice Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 male mice, 6-week old, and ICR nude female mice (nu/nu; 5 weeks of age) were purchased from Japan Bio-Supply Center (Tokyo, Japan). The animals were maintained at 25 /C62/C14C, humid- ity 50 /C62%, and a light and dark cycle of 12 h in our animal facilities. The mice were randomly divided into groups of five mice and fed chow containing JTT (0.2% or 1%) or regular diet (control). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Showa University for Animal Experiments. Reagents and Antibodies JTT was provided by Tumura Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) as a preservative free pure powder. JTT is Louis, MO, USA) was dissolvedin 0.5 N lactic acid at a concentration of 5%, diluted withphosphate buffered saline to the total volume of 10 ml,and then sterilized by passing through a 0.2-mm filter(8). Anti-asialo-GM1 was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) against IFN- gwas purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (9) from ascites from ICR- nudemice inoculated against NK1.1 was kindly donatedfrom Dr N. Watanabe (Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Diet Containing JTT Pure powder of JTT was well mixed with normal powder diet (MF) for maintaining rats and mice (Oriental KoboKogyou Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at concentrations of either0.2 or 1.0%. The concentration of JTT in the diet (0.2%)is equivalent to the clinical dose (7.5 g/day/50 kg) (10). Tumor Cells B16 melanoma cells were purchased from Dai-Nippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and maintainedwith RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, North Ride, Australia). Assay for Tumor Cell Metastasis In the first experiments, B16 cells (2 /C210 5) were injected subcutaneously into the right hind sole in a volume of 0.l ml. After tumor growth reached /C241c m ( /C2414 days after cell injection), the tumor was removed under adissecting microscope. These mice were then maintained for further 21 days and the black dots, showing tumor colony formation, on the lung surface were counted under a dissecting microscope (11,12). In the secondexperiments, B16 cells (2 /C210 5) were injected intra- venously into recipient mice in a volume of 0.1 ml. After 14 days, mice were killed under ether anesthesiaand the number of tumor colonies on the lung surfacewas counted in a similar manner. In these two experi- ments, mice were given food containing JTT and tap water ad libitum for 2 or 3 weeks starting 7 days before tumor cell injection. Assay for Cell Cytotoxicity of JTT B16 melanoma 4cells/ml) were introduced in triplicate into 24-well culture plates that contained various concentrations of JTT. The number of cells was counted with trypan blue 24 and 48 h after culture.2o f6 Effect of JTT on lung metastasis of cells in vivoDepression of NK Cell and NKT To depress NK cells and NKT cells, anti-NK1.1 mAb was injected intraperitoneally into mice at a single dose of 10 mg/kg on Days /C02, 0, 2 and 7 relative to tumor cell injection (13). In a case of NK cell depression, anti-asialo-GM1 antibody was injected intraperitoneally intomice at a dose of 200 mg/mouse 1 day after tumor cell injection (14). Depression of IFN- cand IL-12 To depress IFN- g, anti-IFN- gmAb was injected into mice on Days 3, 0, 3, 7, 9, 11, 14 relative to tumor cell injection at a single dose of 50.0 mg/day. To suppress IL-12, amrinone was given intraperitoneally every dayfrom Day /C01 to 14 at a single dose of 100 mg/day (8) in a volume of 0.4 ml. Statistical Analysis The statistical significance between control and experi- mental groups was analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's PLSD test. P< 0.05 was considered significant. Results Suppression of B16 Melanoma Cell Metastasis by JTT This experiment was undertaken to examine the influence of oral administration of JTT on tumor cell metastasis using different two types of experimental models. Mice pretreated with either 0.2% or 1.0% JTT for 7 days wereinjected intravenously with 2 /C210 5B16 cells and were killed 14 days later to count the number of tumor cell colonies in the lungs. As shown in Fig. 1A, oral admin-istration of 0.2% JTT could cause significant of melanoma cell metastasis. Furthermore, this suppressive activity of JTT on tumor metastasiswas further strengthened when mice were pretreated with 1.0% JTT: the number of tumor cell colonies observed in mice treated with 1.0% JTT was much lower thanthat in 0.2% JTT-treated mice. We then examined whether oral administration of JTT could also prevent spontaneous tumor cell metastasis as in the case ofintravenous administration of tumor cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, administration of 1.0% JTT into mice could prevent spontaneous B16 melanoma cell metastasis from right hind footpad to lung surface. Influence of JTT on Tumor Cell Growth in vitro The present study was designed to determine whether JTT exerts cytotoxic effects on B16 melanoma cellsand results in the prevention of tumor cell metastasis.As shown in Table 1, JTT could not suppress B16 melanoma cell growth even when cells were culturedin the presence of 25% JTT: the number of cells inexperimental cultures observed at 48 h is almost equal tothat observed in control cultures. Effect of NK Cell and NK-1.1 Cell Depression on Tumor Cell Metastasis in JTT-treated Mice This experiment was carried out to examine the influence of NK cell and NK-1.1 cell depression on tumor cellmetastasis. To do this, recipient mice were given eitheranti-asialo-GM1 or anti NK-1.1 mAb, and challengedintravenously with B16 melanoma cells. After 14 days,the influence of cell depletion was assessed by countingthe number of tumor cell colonies on lung surface. As shown in Fig. 2, injection of anti asialo-GM into mice Figure 1. Influence of JTT on B16 melanoma cell metastasis in mice. C57BL/6 mice were orally administered JTT, which was started 1 week before injection of 2 /C2105melanoma cells and killed 3 or 5 weeks later to count tumor cell colonies in the lungs.

Viable cells were counted with haemo- cytometer presence of trypan blue.eCAM 2009 action of JTT on tumor cell metastasis: the number of colonies in mice treated withantibody is significantly higher than that in control mice. Injection of anti NK-1.1 mAb also eliminated the ability of JTT to prevent tumor cell metastasis and higher number of colonies was observed in mAb-treated mice as compared with control. Tumor Cell Metastasis in Cytokine-depressed JTT-treated Mice This study was designed to examine the influence of cytokine depression on the prevention of tumor cell metastasis induced by 1.0% JTT administration. Micewere treated with either anti IFN- gmonoclonal antibody or amrinone and challenged with 2 /C210 5tumor cells. After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the number of tumor cell colonies in the lung surface was counted. As shown in Fig. 3, injection of anti-IFN- gmAb scarcely affected the suppressive activity of JTT on tumor cell metastasis and the number of tumor cell colonies in JTT- treated, mAb-injected mice was similar to that observedin JTT-treated, non-mAb-injected mice. On the other hand, treatment of mice with amrinone caused significant suppression of the ability of JTT to prevent tumor cell metastasis and many metastatic nodules of the lung JTT-treated, amrinone-injected micecompared with JTT-treated, non-injected mice.Discussion Herbal medicine is used frequently as a supplemental therapy for many kinds of chronic diseases with remarkably success (1). In cases of treatment for cancer, herbal medicine is reported to be able to prevent the progression of colon carcinoma, gastric and breastcancer as well as the prevention of the cancer metastasisto the liver, lung or bone (15). However, the mechanismsby which herbal medicine could improve clinical status ofcancer patients, including cancer metastasis. The presentstudy, therefore, was undertaken to examine the possiblemechanisms of herbal medicine on the prevention ofcancer metastasis through the choice of JTT and system in vivo . We regard JTT has an ability to prevent cancer metastasis by BRM (biological response modifierthe). The present results showed that oral administration of JTT inhibited B16 melanoma cell colony formation on the lung surface, when the recipient mice were giventumor cells intravenously (Fig. 1A). JTT also suppressedspontaneous B16 tumor cell metastasis from hind foot-pad to the lung surface (Fig. 1B). The prevention oftumor cell growth and metastasis is well accepted to bethrough diverse mechanisms, including tumor cell death, Figure 3. Influence of anti-IFN- gmonoclonal antibody or amrinone injection on B16 melanoma cell metastasis in mice treated with JTT. C57BL mice were orally administered with 1.0% JTT for 3 weeks, which was started 1 week before 2 /C2105melanoma cell injection. Anti- IFN- gmonoclonal antibody or amrinone was injected intraperitoneally and number of tumor cell colonies was counted 2 weeks later.+p<0.05. Figure 2.

Our results revealed the absence of cytotoxic effects of JTT onB16 melanoma cells (Table 1) suggesting that immune-mediated mechanisms are responsible for the preventionof tumor cell colony formation on the lung surface. The immune effector responses against tumor cells involveactivity by several cellular constituents: (i) T cells carry out immunologic surveillance, then proliferates and destroys tumor cells after recognizing tumor-associatedantigens in combination with major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) molecules. (ii) Dendritic cells areimportant antigen presenting cells that can presentantigen to both helper and cytotoxic T cells and areable to stimulate a na \u00a8ve T cell response. (iii) NK and NKT cells are another populations of effector cells with tumoricidal activity. In contrast to cytotoxic T cells, NK cells can kill tumor cells in a non-MHC-dependent fashion. We, therefore, examined the finaleffector cells that cause tumor cell killing in JTT-treatedmice. The present results proved that injection ofNK-1.1 mAb and anti asialo-GM1 antibody eliminatethe on tumor cell metastasis.Anti NK-1.1 mAb is reported to be the effective means of the depleting NK and NKT cells (16). On the other hand, injection of anti-asialo-GM1 antibody into miceonly eliminate NK cells from a variety of mouse strains(16). Taken together, the present results may suggestthat NK cells play essential roles in prevention of tumor cells metastasis in the lung. Several cytokines have been shown to affect NK cell proliferation and cytolytic activity. Of these, IFN- g, produced by activated T cells and NK cells, in conjunc-tion with other cytokines such as IL-12, is thoughtto enhance the cytolytic activity of NK cells to attachand kill tumor cells (17-19), indicating that oraladministration of JTT into mice increases the levels ofcytokines, including IFN- gand IL-12 in the lung tissues and results in prevention of tumor cell colony formation.On the other hand, the present results also open the question that whether IFN- gor IL-12 is important for the development of the ability to prevent tumor metastasis observed in JTT-treated mice. The presentresults indicate that administration of neutralizing anti-IFN- gmAb could not abrogate the suppressive activity on tumor cell metastasis. However, administra-tion of amrinone, which cause specific suppression ofIL-12 production (20), caused complete elimination of the ability of JTT to prevent tumor metastasis in the lung. These results strongly suggest that IL-12 is the mainmediator in the development of inhibitory action ontumor metastasis observed in mice treated with JTT. Although the present results indicated that JTT exerts the protective effects on tumor cell metastasis throughenhancement of IL-12 production and NK cell activation, the component of JTT which shows immuno-modulatory effects, is not defined. There is evidence that oraladministration of extracts from A. radix , a component of JTT, could enhance the ability of cells to produce several types of cytokines, which increase NK and NKTcell activity (21,22). It is also observed that A. radix directly activate NK cells to kill tumor cells in vitro (22-24), suggesting that A. radix is the most important component of JTT to prevent tumor cell metastasis. Further experiments are required to delineate the com-ponent, showing the suppressive activity of tumor cell metastasis in vivo . The conclusions re-stated are as follows: (i) JTT could prevent tumor cell metastasis through the enhancement of NK cell activity, and (ii) This activity of JTT may be owing, in part, to its ability to increase in IL-12 production.
