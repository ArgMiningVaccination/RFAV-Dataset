(p 32) 'The red-brick Norman fortress of the college was green under Virginia creeper, and pink oleanders flowered around the tennis courts. Behind the college was the wild bush of King's Park, and in front of it, beyond the sloping lawns, the broad blue moody river. The noises of the college were noises of peace: people yarning on the balconies, people singing in the showers, voices in the quadrangle calling the names of people wanted on the telephone. The chapel bell tolled in the morning and in the evening, and when his turn came to read Compline, Rick found himself wishing everybody, with unexpected sincerity, a quiet night and a perfect end. On the balconies, in the high panelled Hall with great windows on the river, in the showers and the Junior Common Room and the bedroom-studies, the talk went on and on.

G With my very best wishes, Jo Evans (1988) Editor, The Georgian jevans@stgc.uwa.edu.auNow that the W A borders are finally open it has been wonderful to see so many interstate and overseas Georgians visiting the College. Photos of some of them are in the News & Visitors section of the magazine (p 47). Georgians and their families are very welcome to come and see us at the College and we're always happy to show you around so you can see what has changed since you were a College resident - and please don't worry - a photo for The Georgian magazine is not obligatory! Open borders also means that we are finally able to hold Georgian events in other parts of Australia. The Warden, Ian Hardy, is visiting Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney in September so Georgian events are being planned to coincide. More information will be sent out once details are confirmed, and keep your eye on the Events page of the College website: https://stgc.uwa.edu.au/events Applying to College With university applications and offers happening earlier in the year, applications to live at College being made earlier as well. A consequence of this is that we are filling places for 2023 much earlier than previously - for our 2022 fresher intake we had a waiting list by August 2021. If you know of students intending to apply to live at St George's in 2023, please encourage them to do so as soon as possible! More information about our application process is on our website: https://stgc.uwa.edu.au/how-to-apply 4 5 WINTER 2022From the EditorFrom the Warden David Norman Scholarships I have had the greatest pleasure over the past months talking to Jo Norman, daughter of David Norman (1948). David was a resident from 1948 to 1950, excelling at College in his engineering studies and as athlete and oarsman. After early professional work in Adelaide and W oomera (and a fair few Georgians seem to have passed through W oomera in the early 1950s and, indeed, later), David specifically sought employment with Carrier Corporation in T oronto as they were leaders in air conditioning systems in which he had developed an interest. He returned to Australia in 1959 and set up a partnership in Sydney with fellow Georgian Leo Addicoat (1949) that expanded to include offices in Australian state capitals including Perth. The partnership was re-arranged and, under David's guidance, became the very well- known Norman Disney & Y oung (NDY), today a component of the international US-listed engineering consultancy T etra T ech. NDY was an early market mover in providing sustainable solutions, and has undertaken many major national projects such as new Parliament House, Canberra. Reflecting his Beverley farming heritage, in the late 1970s David invested in farms, and set about applying biological farming solutions; in every respect he was an early environmentalist. His soil improvement programs came to pay particular dividends during periods of drought sustaining his sheep. David, who died in 2020, was a long-term College donor and a Foundation Fellow. David set up a family office to further and to continue his charitable interests, and to manage the family's farming interests. Jo is responsible for philanthropic activities, working with her sisters, Jenny and Suz, and the family determined that they would be keen to commemorate their father, the part the College played in his life, and their W estern Australian connections through the endowment of David Norman Scholarships as part of the Centenary Appeal. This was excellent news and maintains our momentum as we steadily pursue our ambition to raise $24 million by 2031 to endow transformative scholarships. David Norman Scholarship preference will be for engineering students, with further preference for applicants who are female; from rural, regional, or indigenous backgrounds; would benefit from financial assistance; and who reflect innovation and a regard for sustainability and the environment. The College: An environment for the achievement of excellence and for personal development Although maybe susceptible to some slight one-eyedness, I am of the view that the opportunities offered at St George's for the achievement of excellence (academic, social, musical, cultural) and for personal development are second to none. Scholarships secure access to those opportunities for deserving students, and preserve our unique and enviable character and identity in perpetuity. Our character and identity that are so critical to the College's humane and productive environment derive significantly from the blend of places from which our residents come - regional and rural W estern Australia, metropolitan Perth, interstate and international; the variety of subjects and interests pursued by our residents; and the diversity of backgrounds of our residents. These are key ingredients for the creation of that envelope of College characteristics which foster innovation, growth, achievement, kindness, and consideration. These characteristics include determination, accepting people for who they are, being comfortable in your own skin, and valuing others as well as yourself; simply the true characteristics of collegiality that develop from living side by side each other in this College together.Centenary Appeal and other scholarships The Centenary Appeal Scholarships are critical to the provision of access to the College and the preservation of our character and identity. This is a priority for the College and its future, and please if you have any interest in supporting the Appeal or wishing to be involved in the Appeal, do not hesitate to contact me or any of the Appeal Committee members. I would also like to say that the opportunity always additionally exists to support scholarships that may have a specific focus or be of different endowment amount to those under the Centenary Appeal. For example, we are acutely aware that other Australian universities, working with their colleges, have developed packages to attract the very best of students from all round the country. The residential scholarships can be up to full fees that demand a substantial endowment. I believe that we should be seeking to retain our leading W estern Australian students (metropolitan and regional) in W estern Australia and within the College's fertile environment. So, if it were that or, for instance, providing residential support for international students, music students, sports people, or some other group of which you were a constituent (or, indeed, a party of one), or which you consider of great value to the future College, please do contact me to discuss. My belief is that we can build on our music achievements to become the King's College Cambridge of the Southern Hemisphere. As for King's, endowment support for that achievement on a permanent basis is key. This is such an area that I would certainly be keen to explore with prospective donors. Semester One 2022 The College has been a little different in Semester One 2022 as the State has navigated the pandemic and re-opened to the rest of the country and world. Thankfully most teaching at UW A has been offered face-to-face, and this has been very positive. It is also pleasing to note that changes at the University in teaching and degree courses are meeting with resident favour. The introduction of the four-year Engineering (Honours) course, essentially returning us to the 4 5 WINTER 2022From the W ardenpre-Melbourne Model position, is an example of a well-received change. Although all residents and employees were Covid vaccinated and registered, for which I was most grateful and was done with minimal fuss, we still had to observe regulations in relation to room capacities and access to the College. Our response to restriction on Hackett Dining Hall numbers was to place tables all around the Cloisters and A Balcony. That made for a memorable experience, although we were pleased to return finally to the Dining Hall which does promote such strong interaction between all residents. Nevertheless, we are considering making the outdoor lunching and dining a possible feature of future Semester One programs. The College also had to manage the spread of infection, making arrangements for isolation including service of meals to rooms. An efficient electronic notification system was introduced, and catering and housekeeping teams dealt excellently with the demands despite sometimes being down on numbers themselves. As I write during Semester One 185 residents have been in College isolation as a result of positive tests or close contact status, 42 have isolated offsite, and 20 staff members have had Covid. Isolation numbers are now much reduced. My estimate is that a significant majority of residents are now recorded as having had Covid (in or before semester) and one suspects that a reasonable percentage have been asymptomatic. W e hope that Semester T wo 2022 will not be so significantly disrupted. Re-awakening As restrictions have relaxed, the College has been able to re-commence its outward-facing programs. In May the residents arranged two Practice of Dinners (Engineering and Medicine), the General Music Dinner, an Acoustic Night in the Chapel, a Community Day, and an address by Kate Chaney, postponed from earlier in the year and interesting in that she has now been elected as the Federal member for Curtin, in which the College sits. The College also managed to host the Scholarships Dinner attended by donors and recipients. Regrettably in the same month the College Play, a Business and Commerce Committee evening, and music events had to be postponed due to Covid infections but we look forward to re-arranging for Semester T wo, which promises to be very active with the planned resumption of the full academic, cultural and social program. Expectations and updated Rules The College is permanently engaged in review and development of policies and rules to meet our changing environment. In the last decade we have adapted rules to deal with, for example, social media, and have responded to the findings of reports such as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (commenced in 2013), the Australian Human Rights Commission Change the Course: National Report on Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment at Australian Universities (2017), and the Universities Australia 2021 National Student Safety Survey. At the beginning of Semester One 2022 a further step was taken when the College brought into effect upgraded and significantly amended Rules and Regulations. These rules dovetail with refreshed policies such as the College Sexual Misconduct Policy (2021) developed collaboratively with the University and other colleges. It is a priority that our rules remain responsive to contemporary expectations and reflect best practice. I hope that the introduction to the 2022 updated College Rules, set out below, provides an understanding of our values, intentions, and approach to living together in a college today, and is informative. 'The College has a responsibility to provide a healthy and safe physical environment for all residents, employees, guests, and visitors. This responsibility is reciprocal, and all residents, employees, guests, and visitors have a shared obligation to maintain such an environment. These Regulations and Rules support the discharge of this responsibility. The Regulations and Rules apply: (a) to all persons entering into a Contract; (b) on the College site; (c) on virtual environments (e.g. email, intranet systems, social media, online forums, communities and platforms); (d) at premises in which research, study or learning is undertaken as part of a St George's College activity, including offsite camps and activities; and (e) at all activities and events officially arranged by the College (e.g. sporting events, cultural activities, competitions, conferences and Alumni activities), regardless of where the activity is held. By entering into a Contract..., College Members are agreeing to observe and be bound by these Regulations and Rules. The College is a place of residence for students pursuing courses at The University of W estern Australia and at other tertiary education providers approved by the College, who are adults Freshers having lunch on the A Balcony during O-Week 6 7 WINTER 2022From the W ardenor generally considered as adults. The College will seek to provide educational opportunities and support for College Members as adults within a tertiary educational environment. The College does not seek to provide medical, wellbeing, relationship, or other professional advice or care. It seeks to provide appropriate access for College Members to professional providers of these services. The College will provide the services set out in the annual Fee Schedule. All College Members are expected: \u00bbT o treat fellow College Members, employees, guests, visitors, and the College itself with respect. \u00bbT o act ethically, responsibly, and honestly, so as to maintain the College as a healthy and safe environment for all College Members, employees, guests and visitors. \u00bbT o respect others' wellbeing and privacy, physically and through electronic and other media. \u00bbT o maintain a collaborative approach to all relationships within the College and with those associated with the College at all times. \u00bbT o seek freely informed and voluntary consent from other parties when undertaking any activity (personal or group) or entering resident rooms or other relevant spaces.' Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney events With the relaxation of travel restrictions I am hoping to travel to the Eastern States in September and to take that opportunity to catch up with Georgians. I am very much looking forward to seeing you again after the too long Covid interval. Please do feel welcome to attend and to gather with fellow Georgians, their families and friends once more. W e are hoping to arrange events in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Canberra. I am also looking forward to seeing Georgian visitors from near and far within the College now that we are opened up again. Please always feel welcome to visit us. G Ian Hardy WardenOn Tuesday 15th February 2022 the Foundation Chairman Dr David Horn (1982) and the Warden hosted a dinner in the Georgian Room to celebrate the executing earlier that evening of three further Centenary Appeal trust deeds for the Samantha Argyle Scholarship; the I.S.E. and B.A. Jahn Scholarship; and the Gene Tilbrook Scholarship. Regrettably Peter Knight (1956), who has endowed the Hughie Knight Scholarship in memory of his father, was unable to join us that evening. Centenary Appeal Update The donors expressed their pleasure at being able to assist future residents to attend the College, and concurred that the dinner represented the best of value. The scholarships express a preference to support regional students studying engineering at UW A (Hughie Knight); female residents from a regional area studying at UW A (ISE & BA Jahn); regional students studying science or mathematics at UW A (Gene Tilbrook); and residents studying veterinary science (Samantha Argyle).

Governance Governance is a principal responsibility of the Board and, in necessary response to societal expectations, remains in an ever-present process of evolution and development. Our effective governance relies on inputs from Committees, Board, and Council. These are directed by Georgians who represent the majority of members and who also work closely and collaboratively with our stakeholders - the Diocese and UW A. A vigilant, reflective, and forward-looking approach is essential to meet changing expectations. The Board has had some departures. I would like to thank those members for their generous contributions of time and expertise: Kerry Robertson (member 2015 - 2021), former Principal of Frederick Irwin Anglican School, for her insight into and assessment of the secondary school environment, developments, and trends, and who helped maintain our good connections with Anglican and regional schools; Professor T ony O'Donnell (member 2017-2021), UW A Executive Dean of Science and Senate nominee, who linked us effectively with the University; and Megan McCracken (Egerton-Warburton 1985) and Geoff Goldsmith (1986) (members 2019-2022). Geoff's contribution with respect to finance and particularly risk modelling throughout COVID and Megan's insight on governance and policy have been of great value to the Board and College.As part of its good governance development, the Board has established a Nominations Committee. The Nominations Committee pleasingly received a significant number of applications for Board membership from which recommendations were made, and accepted at the last Board meeting. I am pleased to say that other applicants have been invited to become involved with the College and Foundation in other capacities. I consequently welcome to the Board the following new members: Mike Giles, C\u00e9cile Crochu, Mark Coughlan, and Professor Natalie Skead. Mike is the COO of the Anglican Schools Commission and a former Principal of Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School, whose children Natasha (2012) and Henry (2012) both resided at College. Mike is a leader within the W estern Australian and Anglican secondary education sectors, and the Board will be advantaged by his knowledge of these areas integral to our successful operation. C\u00e9cile has had a prominent career in international finance, and since locating with her family to Perth has become significantly involved in the W estern Australian not-for-profit sector. Her commercial expertise and international perspective will be of substantial benefit to the Board. Mark is a pre-eminent member of the W estern Australian music and performing arts community. He is an acclaimed pianist and Chairman of the Government House Foundation of W A. He has served previously as CEO of the W estern Australian Symphony Orchestra and Head of the UW A School of Music. Mark has also successfully developed significant commercial interests. He has been the Chair of the College Music Committee since its inception. Mark will contribute in all areas but especially in the further strategic development of our music and cultural activities. Natalie is the Dean of the UW A Law School and the Senate nominee to the Board. She is a national award-winning teacher and prolific researcher in the areas of equity, trusts, property, remedies, and legal education. She is a Fellow and Director of the Australian Academy of Law, and the Chair of the Australasian Law Academics Association. Natalie will enable us to align our efforts with those of UW A, and will, with Professor Paul Johnson, be able to provide insight into tertiary sector trends and development. Her legal expertise will also be a great asset. Other Board members have the additional responsibilities of chairing the following committees: Kevin Kerr (1999) - Planning; Paul Evans (1982) - Finance; Rosalind Potts (Chelliah 1989) - Education, and the Diocesan representative Keith Stephens - Nominations. Last year Paul Johnson accepted another term on the Board. He is Warden of Forrest Hall and provides the Board with an overview of and experience in, at the highest level, tertiary education in Australia and internationally. In addition, David Cannon (1962), former Chair of the Foundation, re-joined the Board as the Foundation representative. His deep and long-term knowledge of College and Foundation represents an incomparable resource and will promote highly effective coordination and collaboration between both entities. The Georgian President and Board representative, Dr Georgia Hay (2012), advances and keeps us advised of the Georgian Committee programs. She also supplements our active tertiary sector connections, and her research (as a Forrest Prospect Fellow) into workplace and organisational activity and behaviours is also most valuable. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Secretary Peter Wreford (1963) for his countless hours devoted to minute taking at the many meetings held throughout the year. Council Membership Other noteworthy changes to the STGC governance structure relate to Council membership. Council is the body that oversees the Board, the Foundation and the Georgian Committee. It receives accounts and reports, approves rule changes, can request investigation of matters, and has the authority to dismiss the Board. It is comprised of representatives of our stakeholders: the original two - the Diocese and University, Georgians, Foundation, and College. In 2020 the College Rules were amended to enable increased representation. Council membership now includes the Visitors (the Archbishop and UW A Vice-Chancellor); College 8 9 WINTER 2022From the Board ChairBoard; College Foundation Board; Honorary Life Members, Foundation Patrons (those contributing $100,000 or more), and additional Ordinary Members representing the Diocese, University, and Georgians. This has enabled us to co-opt UW A's Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education). It also allowed us to effect the inclusion by 2022 of all major Anglican School leaders. In 2021 the Principals of Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School; Guildford Grammar School; Hale School, and St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls, as well as the CEO of the Anglican Schools Commission became members of the Council. This year Council has welcomed the Principals of Christ Church Grammar School, Perth College, and St Mary's Anglican Girls' School. These changes strengthen the College's links to Anglican schools, provide access to the principals' knowledge of the current W A secondary education sector, and enhance those leaders' capacity to be kept abreast of UW A and College thinking and developments. Capital Works One of the major resolutions at the November 2021 board meeting was the allocation of $1.1 million for the renovation of North Wing and surrounds which was awarded to Cheson Builders. Now, with completion of the work, all rooms, bathrooms (both ensuite and communal), balconies, doors, and common areas have been upgraded. What will be obvious to returning Georgians is the improvement of surrounds in the vicinity of the Chapel, with the removal of scrub and trees. No trees were assessed to be of any significant value bar one cork oak which turned out to be infested with rot. All were replaced with new landscaping. The undertaking of these works was timely for a less obvious reason as the major original water supply into the College was near to collapse due to rust, and gas, electrical and emergency water infrastructure was not compliant and, in some cases, unsafe. I am pleased to report that the works were completed on time and budget. A challenge moving forward is addressing the parking needs of residents. In this regard the Board is considering how to formalise the present temporary parking on the front lawn into something more permanent and attractive, hopefully in 2022/23. Finance 2021 saw a surplus before depreciation of $162,146. This was a satisfactory result especially in view of managing the impact of COVID, inflation and the discounting of fees in response to global uncertainties. The reduced fees initiative paid off with full occupancy throughout 2021 and predicted to be similar in 2022. In 2023 fees return to a more reasonable level - $19,450. The fees are probably still a bit low and do represent strong value for residents. With a tenable prospect of full occupancy, and gradual return of vacation business using Rodgers Wing and other upgraded facilities, this should result in stronger future surpluses. As of 31st December 2021 the net cash or comparable reserves, including the College Reserve Fund managed by the Foundation, was $3,776,647 with net assets of $67 .2 million substantially represented by the buildings which are now in, we consider, sound condition. As of 31st December 2021 the Foundation had net assets of $15.1 million including scholarship funds of $8.1 million and endowment funds of $5.3 million. W e still have work to do to raise the Scholarship and Endowment funds to a level commensurate with a college of our type and ambition, but we have now achieved a satisfactory foundation upon which to build. So positive progress. I conclude by sincerely thanking Georgians and friends for your support and optimism for the future that is shared by the Board and propels us forward. G Marino Evangelisti (1982) Board Chair 8 9 WINTER 2022From the Board ChairIn 2031 St George's College will celebrate its Centenary. Annual Giving this year continues to raise funds for Centenary Appeal scholarships which will commemorate each of the 14 young Georgians who died in service during the Second World War. This will ensure that their sacrifice will be remembered in perpetuity. W e are pleased to announce that the first two scholarships, in memory of T ed Parsons (1937) and Syd Rowe (1934), will be awarded in 2023. T ed and Syd's stories can be found on our web site (https://stgc. uwa.edu.au/tedparsons and https://stgc. uwa.edu.au/sydrowe). This year we are raising funds to award a scholarship in memory of Fred Schoch (1936). On 19th November 1941, Fred was on the light cruiser HMAS Sydney (II) when she was sunk off the coast of Geraldton, after a battle with the German raider Kormoran. Tragically, of the Sydney's 645 crew, the majority of which were young men in their late teens and early twenties, there were no survivors and the loss of the Sydney remains Australia's worst naval disaster. Fred Schoch was 23 years old when he died and had been married for just over a month. Read on for Fred's story. More information about him is also on our website https://stgc.uwa.edu.au/fred- schoch Your Support Every gift is welcomed and appreciated. All Australian gifts are tax deductible. W e need your support for Annual Giving. Y our contribution will help us achieve our pivotal goals by our Centenary in 2031 and will provide life-changing opportunities for students who, without your support, will not otherwise be able to attend and to benefit from College. Y our generosity secures the long-term future of the College and residents to come. The College receives no state or federal government support. Engineering Sub Lieutenant Fred Schoch (1918-1941) Frederick Harold Schoch was born in Geraldton in 1918. He was educated at Kalgoorlie High School, before winning a scholarship to Perth Modern School in 1934. He lived at St George's College from 1936 until 1939 while he gained his Bachelor of Engineering, with honours in electrical engineering. In October 1940 he left his job at Co-operative Bulk Handling to join the Navy and was posted to HMAS Sydney (II). Fred's determination to join the Navy was not to be diverted by his romance and wedding. But the strength of his twin passions is clear from an account of their all-too-brief marriage by his widow, Betty, which she wrote for the College in 2007 . Fred and I met at a New Y ear's Day picnic in 1937. I was in leaving year at school, Fred in second year at UWA and residing at St George's College. W e formed a firm friendship in the years that followed. I started nursing training at old Perth Hospital and on Sunday afternoons College residents were allowed to ask friends for tea and scones in the beautiful refectory. Fred would walk with me around the river and back to the hospital, or we'd have a game of tennis. In early 1940 Fred completed his engineering degree, we became engaged, Fred joined the Navy and was posted to HMAS Sydney.As student nurses were not allowed to marry we hoped to be married after I finished my training, war permitting. On 15th October 1941 Fred came back having been at sea for three months and asked if we could be married that day. I agreed and thought if I was dismissed from the hospital, so be it! John Bell, Rector of Christ Church, Claremont, married us with his housekeeper as the witness in our own special little service. That night Fred said \"Cobber, if we can't spend any more of our lives together we must thank God for what we've had. \" I don't think I would ever have recalled these words had tragedy not struck soon afterwards. Fred sailed early next morning and returned on 10th November. W e had that day together, and then Sydney sailed at dawn on 11th November. I was on evening duty at the hospital on 24th November when I noticed my brother standing at the entrance to the ward after visiting hours. I knew something awful must have happened. He gave me a telegram that said the Navy regretted to inform me that my husband was missing, presumed dead. Fred's prophetic words came flooding into my mind. By next morning everyone in the hospital knew that HMAS Sydney was 'lost' and I had married. Nobody reprimanded me, all were sympathetic. Annual Giving 2022: Fred Schoch Scholarship 10 11 WINTER 2022Annual Giving 2022 Fred and Betty Schoch on their wedding day.The official announcement of the loss of the Sydney was delayed until 12 days after the event. Because of widespread rumours, the delay in the official announcement, the lack of any explanation as to how this disaster could have happened and the secrecy surrounding the official investigation, the Australian public were deeply suspicious that a lot was being concealed. The controversy and secrecy over the loss of the Sydney has troubled many people ever since. Fred's final resting place is presumed to be at the wreck site, discovered in March 2008 and declared a war grave. The names of the crew of the HMAS Sydney (II) are commemorated at the Mount Scott memorial in Geraldton, where a bronze statue of a woman looks out to sea waiting in vain for the cruiser to come home. The memorial is the work of sculptors Joan Walsh-Smith and Charles Smith who are also responsible for the sculpture of the swans in the College pond. Fred's obituary in the 1942 Dragon notes: V ery few know of the great sacrifice he made to join the Navy - not merely a sacrifice of material position, but a mental sacrifice. He abhorred the thought of war, and the formalisation and ceremony connected with uniform, yet, after deliberation, he decided the only course of action open to him was to join the Navy. Every obstacle was placed in his way both by employers and authorities, these serving only to increase his determination to do what he saw as right... It is in College life, where we are in contact continually with our fellows, meeting them in all their moods, that an absolutely sound judgement can be made. Fred's College and University contemporaries agree that it is no idle phrase to say that he was a true gentleman and loyal friend. Of his personality and disposition, much could be written; suffice it to say that those qualities which mark a truly great character - simplicity and sincerity - were the dominant features of his life and his attitude to life.

Although Covid restrictions were still in place, freshers and their families were able to enjoy drinks and dinner in the Quad without masks. The newest College residents signed the College Register, received their own copy of Randolph Stow 's (1954) \" The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea\" and were welcomed in speeches from Warden Ian Hardy, Georgian President Georgia Hay (2012) and Senior Student Nick Kennedy. Parents were then farewelled and Orientation Week began in earnest. Most of the usual activities took place, such as Lawn Bowls, Zumba at the UWA Rec Centre, the Scavenger Hunt in the Perth CBD and the water slide on the front lawn. Unfortunately, after a week of practicing the Fresher Dance, the Intercollege Fresher Festival had to be cancelled but College freshers were still able to perform their dance at Matilda Bay. This was followed by the traditional dip in the river and a rousing rendition of the unofficial College song, Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". It was a great way to finish off O-Week. Congratulations to the College Club Executive and the O-Week Crew for organising such a successful week. 2 3 4 5 6 7 81 12 13 WINTER 2022Commencement Ceremony and O-W eek Commencement Ceremony and O-W eek1: Holly Turnor & Dom Jason 2: Performing the Fresher Dance at Matilda Bay 3: L-R Stuart Everett, Cameron Swart, Jacob van Noort, Stuart Cross (1995) 13: L-R Leslie Stapleton-Reid, Jemima Reid, Simon Reid (1985) Sophie Kirk, Oscar Bird, Callum Parramore 15: L-R Jacob Royce, Jane Royce, John (Macaulay 1990) 19: Formal Dinner in the Quad9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 12 13 WINTER 2022Commencement Ceremony and O-W eekThe 1944 Dragon commented that 'Approximately 120 Georgians are serving or have served with the Forces.' This is a high number given that only 276 men had entered residence before 1944. War tests all members of a community - participants, families, friends, acquaintances. A group within the St George's community that was especially tested was that comprising those who became prisoners of war. W e are aware of seven residents who became prisoners of war: Jim Simpson (1931), Jack Hands (1932), Bill Lyster (1934), T ony Odlum (1934), T om Darling (1935), Graeme Cameron (1937), and Peter Stevens (1937): of them, Jim Simpson was killed in captivity and Ian 'T om' Darling died in Perth after almost four years in prison camps in Europe. In addition, member of Council from 1932 to 1940 Doctor Leslie Le Souef was captured in Crete and a prisoner of war in Europe, as was T om Darling. The experiences of these eight Georgians should not be, and are not, forgotten. In Part One of this article, the accounts set out below are based on available information regarding Jim Simpson, Jack Hands, Bill Lyster and T ony Odlum, and the College would be grateful for any corrections, clarifications, or additions to them. Jim Simpson Jim Simpson is commemorated in the College's Roll of Honour. He was one of the 20 inaugural College residents in 1931, and one of the four from Goldfields High School. He was Boulder born, bred, and educated. His family that included three sisters and two brothers lived at 243 Burt Street, Boulder. The family business - WC Simpson, Newsagent and Fancy Goods - was at 46-8 Burt Street. The latter premises are now occupied by a pharmacy but 'Newsagent' can still be seen embossed above the shopfront canopy at the right; 'WC Simpson' likely occupied the now white panel in front of the left gable end. Boulder Primary and Central Schools, where he was until aged 12, could be reached in a minute's walk from the shop and not many more from home. Goldfields High School to which a scholarship took Jim was a 40 minute walk.COLLEGE PRISONERS OF WAR: Part One Until the College's Centenary in 2031 Annual Giving will be directed towards endowing Centenary Appeal Scholarships to commemorate the 14 Georgians who died in service during the Second World War. 2021 Annual Giving supported the funding of awards to commemorate Flying Officer Ted Parsons (1937) and Pilot Officer Syd Rowe (1934), RAAF officers who died during raids over Europe. 2022 Annual Giving will commemorate Engineering Sub Lieutenant Fred Schoch who was killed in the sinking of HMAS Sydney on 19th November 1941. 46-8 Burt Street, Kalgoorlie 14 15 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part OneJim was a resident from 1931 to 1933, studying Arts. He was a College cricketer, doubles tennis finalist in 1933 with Bill Edquist, and was the Editor of the 1932 and 1933 Dragons. His Arts degree, majoring in English, took him to The W est Australian, Daily News, and Kalgoorlie Miner, and work in Kalgoorlie and Perth. He met his future wife, Helen, in Perth. She had an ambition to become an artist but in the interim was a saleswoman for a Sydney- based hatmaker. He followed her to Sydney, and they subsequently moved to Melbourne. Jim had been employed by the Commonwealth Department of Information, a reserved occupation, but determined that he should join up and received permission to do so. He became an infantryman and part of 'Gull Force', which was deployed to Ambon, the Dutch colony that now forms part of Indonesia and was under Japanese attack. The Ambon theatre of war of January/February 1942 became one of Australia's most harrowing. Only 352 out of a force of 1,131 survived the war. 246 men were executed after surrender. 457 men died as prisoners in Ambon or Hainan Island, China where some were transferred. Jim (Service Number: VX65203) was recorded as having died in captivity on 20th February 1942, the last of the Ambon massacre days, aged 28. Jim's experience as a prisoner of war was terrible and short, a deathly sacrifice, and a long journey from his artistic wife in Fitzroy and his close-knit Boulder childhood. Jack Hands John Lawrence (Jack) Hands (1933), father of David Hands (1969), was a resident in 1933 and 1934, studying Law, and being a noted teller of 'tall yarns'. In 1935 he joined the Commonwealth Bank in Perth, in 1936 moved with the Bank to Bunbury and in 1938 to Merredin. Although born and from Bunbury, prior to College he was educated, as a boarder, at St Ildephonsus' College, New Norcia and then at Christian Brothers College, Perth (later Aquinas College). Before moving to Merredin Jack had joined the 10th Light Horse, gained a commission in the 44th and after the founding of the 25th Light Horse took charge of the Merredin troop. With the war coming into full swing, he enlisted from Merredin on 3rd June 1940 (Service Number: WX3335). He became part of the W estern Australian D Company of the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion as a company officer. He departed in April 1941 for the Suez en route to Syria and the campaign against the Vichy French that ended in July 1941. Captain Hands remained as part of the occupation force until February 1942 when, with the majority of the battalion, he embarked on the SS Orcades to return to Australia. During the Syrian occupation he met his brother Lincoln who had come north from air training in Nairobi. Some months later Lincoln was killed in a flying accident but Jack knew nothing of this until after the war. With the fall of Singapore in mid- February 1942 the troops were re-directed to become the core of 'Blackforce' that was supposed to defend Java, also a part of the Dutch East Indies. The concept was as flawed as for Jim Simpson's 'Gull Force' and its intent to defend Ambon; similar fates met 'Lark' and 'Sparrow' Forces that were designated to defend Rabaul and Timor: all of these forces had no prospect of extraction. The Japanese landed on Java on 28th February 1942 and 'Blackforce' surrendered on 9th March 1942, the day after the surrender of the Dutch forces. After the war Jack provided evidence in a series of statements to the War Crimes Commission. In consequence there is detail of his captivity. After surrender on 9th March 1942 Jack and the troops under his command (he also commanded camps in which he was held) were pushed from camp to camp in Java - Leles, Garoet, Bandong, and Makasura. They were then shipped to Singapore and later in March 1942 to the Thai-Burma Railway. The next two years were spent in the camps of Hintok, Kinsiok, T onchan, and Tanwan. The first camp was built by the prisoners of war themselves in a jungle clearing. His evidence speaks of beri beri, malaria, no medicines, malnutrition, Jack Hands (1933) & Shirley Forrest's wedding, 1949 Extract from Jack Hands' War Crimes testimony 14 15 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part Onebeatings, ceaseless work with no respite for the severely sick ('only 12 were allowed to be sick...I therefore had to select the worst twelve to be let off work. Those who were sick were sent for 63 days without a rest...'), no clothing - not even boots, beatings, deaths, and murders. 'W eary' Dunlop commended Jack's remarkable performance as a leader on the Railway, and his record in preserving the lives of troops under his command. In June 1944 Jack and his troops were shipped from Singapore on the MV Rashin Maru to Kyushu. On arrival in September 1944 they were transferred to Ohama 9B Prisoner of War Camp, near Shimonoseki. The prisoners worked in coal mines in very dangerous circumstances for extended periods, eight hours a day at the coal face and an hour to march there and an hour back. There was vicious treatment and poor conditions with Red Cross supplies being misappropriated. Following liberation Jack spent time recuperating in Manila before returning to W estern Australia. He was Mentioned in Despatches in 1947 for his distinguished military service in the South- W est Pacific Area. Jack Hands' War Crimes testimony, as with other records, reveals the terrible experience of prisoners of war in the Asian sphere of the Second W orld War but possibly it is in fictional representation that a perhaps more 'realistic' picture can be found. Richard Flanagan's MAN Booker Prize-winning novel, The Narrow Road to the Deep North , is a book that may provide this, and interestingly its story includes scenes in Syria and on the Thai-Burma Railway, where Jack Hands served. Following return to W estern Australia Jack Hands returned to the Commonwealth Bank. In 1949 he married Shirley Forrest in the College Chapel and they proceeded to develop a farming property at Boyup Brook. In addition to his farming career, he invested in various businesses and played a role in the late 1960s nickel boom. Jack died on 3rd June 1992 aged 75. His family supported him throughout his life as he suffered and confronted the effects of his brutal war experience through which he exhibited enormous bravery. Top: Vickers Vildebeest aircrafts. Photo from the RAF Seletar and Tengah Association [RAFSATA] Above and right: Some of Bill Lyster's POW paperwork (National Archives of Australia NAA: A14171, 406183)Bill Lyster Bill Lyster is something of an enigma, peripatetic and with an unfinished tale. He came to the College in 1934 as a third year law student. He was at Geelong Grammar School from 1924 to 1930, and commenced studies at UW A in 1931 when it appears his parents moved to W estern Australia. His stepfather, whose surname he took, was a surgeon. Bill had been born in 1913 in Colchester and his father's surname was Meeson. His stepfather and mother moved back to England to settle in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire with he and his brother, Lionel, remaining in W estern Australia. In 1935 he changed to Arts and completed his BA in Political History. In 1935 he was the Sub-Editor of the Dragon (Gordon Freeth being the Editor) and also contributed a poem, a prose exercise, and a review; his style quite modernist. He was a member of the Discussion Society delivering a paper propounding that self-consciousness, being the greatest bar to self-expression, was the root cause of the decline of the W estern culture, and was perhaps unsurprisingly on the wrong side of a subsequent debate, teamed with Josh Reynolds, on the subject 'That Modern Nationalism Threatens the Existence of European Civilisation'. On completion of his degree he appears to have gone travelling. The Dragons declare that in 1936 he had been in Wiluna, likely with his brother who was assaying at 16 17 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part Onethe goldmines; in 1937 he had returned from a world tour; in 1938 was attached to the University of Hobart [presumably Tasmania]; in 1939 of no address; and in 1940 in the RAAF. Bill enrolled in the RAAF Reserve in April 1940 (Service Number: 406183). His address was Pyramid Station Roebourne, then owned by Harry Meares, who, as the Roebourne JP, administered his service oath and also happens to be the grandfather of Canberra Georgian Doug Sturkey (1953) and great-grandfather of current resident Joanna Edgar. At that stage Bill declared that he was living on private means, travelling, and pursuing postgraduate work on an MA thesis. He enlisted in September 1940, aged 27 , qualified as an air observer, and in August 1941 was transferred to RAF Seletar, Singapore and 100 Squadron RAF. 100 Squadron operated unquestionably obsolete Vickers Vildebeests, three crew bi-plane torpedo bombers. In early 1942 these aircraft took to the skies to be met by modern Japanese fighters, Zeros and the like. Most were shot down but a few aircraft and crew, including Bill Lyster, withdrew following the fall of Singapore in February 1942 to Java. Bill Lyster was recorded as captured in south-west Java on 8th March 1942, the day before the surrender of Jack Hands and his troops. He was a prisoner at the camps of Kalidjah (March-September 1942) and Makasura (September- October 1942) before being transported to Moji in Japan. He worked there as a docker, moving coal extracted from the nearby mine, until liberation in September 1945. Bill had been recorded as missing in April 1942. His parents and brother received news through an RAAF member who had escaped Java that he may still be alive and it was confirmed in May 1943 through the International Red Cross that he was a prisoner in Fukuoka. This information was also provided to an inquiring Miss Cora Fitzpatrick, who together with her sisters, ran The Village Inn (now Fitzpatrick's Inn), W estbury, Tasmania where it seems Bill may have stayed or lodged whilst in Tasmania before the war. Bill seems to have maintained generally good health as a prisoner of war, infrequently presenting for sick parade. After the war he asked about the 885 Japanese Y en that he had given to authorities in Manila whilst being repatriated to Australia. It is interesting to note the reported sources of this money: 200 Y en received in exchange for 200 Dutch guilders, 100 Y en deriving from three years' pay by the Japanese, and 585 Y en from bridge winnings. It is unclear as to what was resolved. On 2nd October 1945 Bill Lyster arrived in Darwin before travelling to Essendon and Tasmania before completing demobilisation and discharge in Victoria on 25th May 1946. His last recorded address prior to discharge was 420 Glenferrie Road, Malvern, Victoria. No further information has been located for him. His older brother, Lionel Lyster, who had lived in Perth until after the war and service in the RAAF, moved to Victoria (T yabb) and later to Pambula, New South Wales. Tony Odlum T ony Odlum (1935) undertook his whole five year engineering degree at the College in the company of his contemporary Fred Schoch (1935) who was to die on HMAS Sydney. They can be seen standing side- by-side in the 1936 College Photograph. T ony was a good oarsman rowing in three seat in the College Boat. In 1935 he was a member of the Dragon Editorial Committee and was a contributor at various times. The details of his life set out below are almost wholly derived from the obituary written by his College friend John Scott (1936) included in the May 1998 Georgian magazine. T ony was born to Grace and Captain William Henry Odlum of the Indian Army Medical Service Ambulance Corps, the latter rose to the rank of Colonel and was a keen and successful polo player. His father died in Ireland in 1920 in somewhat mysterious circumstances in the context of the Irish Civil War. Grace Odlum and T ony came to Australia and Grace subsequently married Alexander Davidson of a well-known Melbourne family. T ony was educated at Guildford Grammar School, Christ Church Grammar School, and finished his schooling as a weekly boarder at Geelong Grammar School in Victoria. After his five years studying for his Degree in Electrical Engineering at The University of W estern Australia, he was awarded his degree of Bachelor of Engineering in 1940. On 14th January 1941 he enlisted in the 2nd/4th Machine Gun Battalion (Service Number: WX11001), and was appointed 1936 College photo - Fred Schoch and Tony Odlum are on the far left in the second row 16 17 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part OneOfficer Commanding of the Light Aid Detachment, with the rank of Captain. After some training in jungle warfare in the Darwin area his battalion was sent to Singapore to help defend it against the threatening Japanese Army. With the island rapidly overrun in February 1942 by the superior Japanese force, survivors of the 2nd/4th Machine Gun Battalion were taken prisoners of war. T ony and his men were held prisoner in Changi jail for three and a half years, during which time he did much to relieve the boredom by setting up schools to teach chess and contract bridge. His family understands that on more than one occasion he was to be transferred to the Burma-Thai Railway but in each instance was debilitated by illness at the relevant time. One of the stories recounted by his men was of how he overcame Japanese oppression in his own way. He was officer in charge of a working party of prisoners who had been ordered by the Japanese to work on the Singapore Golf Course to prepare a site on which the Japanese intended to erect a monument to their conquest of Singapore. The Japanese officer was not satisfied with the progress being made with the work and ordered T ony to get the prisoners to work much harder. T ony was aware that the Japanese officer spoke no English, so he shouted at his men: \"T winkle, twinkle little star, How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a Diamond in the sky\". The men got the message and began to dig furiously which brought a gold-filled toothy grin of satisfaction to the face of the Japanese officer, believing that his orders had been faithfully relayed and carried out. Warden Josh Reynolds kept in touch with T ony's mother through his imprisonment and was the first to contact him following his release. On 24th August 1945 T ony wrote, and interesting to note the addressee: 'Dear Rennie, My first and so far only letter from home has been yours. Needless to say I was extremely glad to hear from you and not a little flattered that you had remembered after so long.' Later letters were addressed to 'Dear Josh'. On his return to Australia, T ony lost no time in marrying his fianc\u00e9e, Pauline Letter from Tony Odlum to Josh Reynolds dated 24th August 1945 18 19 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part OneRenovation of North Wing and surrounds took place over the summer, with new landscaping significantly improving the area. The work led to the serendipitous discovery that the original water supply into the College was near to collapse due to rust, and the gas, electrical and emergency water infrastructure was not compliant and, in some cases, unsafe. Needless to say, these issues were all swiftly remedied. Also discovered was a number of limestone blocks, originally thought to be builders' rubble left over from the construction of the Chapel. Peter Simpson OAM (Warden 1971-1979) solved the mystery when he visited the College recently. The blocks were actually purchased in the 1970s when the Colonial Mutual Life Building was demolished in the City, just in case the College should ever need them. G North Wing and Chapel Surrounds RenovationFarrar, at the St George's College Chapel on 24th November 1945. The W estern Mail headline was 'POW, W AAF W ed After 4 Y ears' Silence'. Although aware that T ony was alive, the Japanese blocked all communications from Pauline for the whole of his captivity. In about 1960 T ony was working on the installation of Perth's early traffic lights. He was reading Bertrand Russell on 'Formal Logic' and decided that 'Formal Logic' could be employed in the solution of complex electrical circuits. He wrote a thesis on the subject and submitted it to the Faculty of Engineering for a Master's degree in Engineering. UW A believed that they were too closely involved to present an unbiased judgement, so his thesis was forwarded to Melbourne University for assessment, and the report came back: \"This is brilliant. Award the man his degree\". So, T ony became a Master of Engineering. His attitude was that if a proposition can be proved mathematically, it is feasible. Following retirement from the Department of W orks T ony was to become a proponent for and an enthusiastic attendee of early 50 Y ear Club lunches. In retirement he also determined to combine sailing interests and engineering abilities and purchased a half-finished steel yacht hull from the 'Star' boatbuilding yard owned by John Rothwell, who was later to be the driving force behind the shipbuilding group Austal at Henderson. T ony fitted out the yacht (Paraweena) with sons, David and Stephen, and sailed it out of Royal Perth Yacht Club. Perhaps reacting to the heartless instruction of his captivity, he was little impressed by, what he considered, over-zealous attention to rules and excessive competitiveness: this could be observed in his personal sailing maxim of 'steel over lesser materials'. His sons were impressed by his indifference to 'Starboard, T ony' from more delicate vessels but their W ednesday night and twilight race sailing captains possibly less so. Paraweena, sold after T ony's death, now bobs about happily in Matilda Bay, commemorating T ony as well as being a sanctuary for later generations of the shags, swallows and odd ducks that he would have known. T ony died on 5th November 1997 , leaving widow Paula and three sons, David, Stephen, and Jonathan. The accounts of T om Darling (1935), Graeme Cameron (1937), Peter Stevens (1937) and Leslie Le Souef will be published in the next edition of The Georgian magazine. G Back of North Wing and behind the Chapel, looking east towards the Warden's House 18 19 WINTER 2022College Prisoners of W ar: Part One / North Wing and Chapel Surrounds RenovationCassandra Howell was awarded the coveted Noel Fitzpatrick Medal at the annual Y oung Professionals in Agriculture Forum. The medal is named in honour of former Department of Agriculture Director General (and Georgian) Noel Fitzpatrick AM (1947). Cassie, a Bachelor of Philosophy major in Botany from UW A, presented her research on the use of compost and biochar, both individually and as combined amendments, to restore degraded saline soil. She found both ameliorants improved soil condition, reducing pH and increasing nitrate, phosphorus and potassium, paving the way for future field research. College Residents' Achievements Tara Anderson and Emma Wiese have both been awarded George Alexander Foundation Scholarships from Murdoch University. This Scholarship is highly competitive and promotes access to education for promising young people, particularly those from rural and remote areas. Emma, from Narrogin, and Tara, from Margaret River, are both studying first year V eterinary Medicine at Murdoch. By developing new strategies for restoration, such as using organic amendments, she hopes to improve farm productivity and long-term sustainability, while also reconnecting fragmented landscapes and supporting biodiverse vegetation and wildlife. Cassie was very proud to win the award and grateful to the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development and the Agriculture Institute Australia W A Branch for the opportunity. She was particularly honoured to receive the medal, as not only was Noel Fitzpatrick a passionate supporter of agriculture in W A, but, as a Georgian, his shared College connection with Cassie is also very special.Tara Anderson Emma Wiese & Sarah Wiese (Davies 1989) 20 21 WINTER 2022College Residents' AchievementsIsabelle Gray has been awarded the Paul Katris Honours/ Masters Scholarship from UW A. This is awarded to a student with an excellent track record in academic achievement and supports them to develop and advance cancer-related research whilst undertaking full-time Honours or Masters studies. Isabelle is doing a Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) in integrated medical science and clinical practice and her Honours research will investigate methods of improving testing and survival for children with leukaemia. The current detection methods for these persistent leukaemia cells are not very accurate so the aim is to determine whether a new type of test, invented in W A, can increase the chance of detecting leukaemia cells that have escaped treatment. This will help to improve current leukaemia testing and detection methods, benefiting both patients and doctors and leading to better outcomes. Isabelle is also the recipient of the College's Gordon McGillivray Bursary. Zeke Tinley won the 2021/22 Open Men's Triathlete of the Y ear Award at the 2022 Annual Triathlon W A Awards in May. Zeke, a member of the Bunbury Triathlon Club, didn't miss a single race in the 2021/22 Senior State Series. He had four race wins including the State Aquathlon Championships and the State Cross Tri Championships, two second places and two third places which made him the top point scoring Open Male athlete for 2021/22. He is currently doing a Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) in exercise physiology, having finished his undergraduate degree in medical sciences last year. He will start Doctor of Medicine (MD) studies in 2023. During full training Zeke trains for 25-30 hours a week. He generally trains three times a day (swim-ride-run), though only once or twice on a Sunday. He does most of his training in Kings Park and around the river, so College is an excellent location for him. Charis Bekker is a member of the W estern Australian team for the W omen's National Cricket League (WNCL), the national domestic 50-over competition for women's cricket. She trains at the W ACA three days per week, and plays club cricket on Sundays during the season. Charis, a right-handed batter and left arm orthodox spin bowler, is also a first year engineering student, majoring in mining.

The College's extensive tutorial program, provision of communal study spaces, and the various initiatives of the Education Committee all support this aim. Academic success is not a one size fits all approach, and it should be noted that it is a metric to aid in the pursuit of personal and professional excellence, and not necessarily the end goal in and of itself. As a means of tracking the progress of our efforts to support our residents' academic goals, and to further refine the support on offer, the College looks at three key metrics each semester when UW A results are released: \u00bbmean unit result; \u00bbpercentage of units completed recording a failing grade (a mark below 50); and, \u00bbpercentage of units completed recording a grade of High Distinction (a mark above 80). T ogether these provide a snapshot of the distribution of unit marks and allow for tracking of academic achievement over time. The graph shows how these three key metrics have changed over time since record-keeping began in 2014. It illustrates that while College residents have consistently performed very well academically over the past eight years, the last three years have been characterised by especially positive academic results. The results from Semester T wo 2021 were especially notable, with the College recording a mean result of 71.96 - our highest Semester T wo mean on record. The High Distinction percentage above 30% and Fail percentage below 5% are likewise consistent with the recent trend of better than average results. This is clearly an achievement to be celebrated, and our residents did so with a coffee cart in the Quad in March. The event, dubbed the \"Good Mark Coffee Cart\", also provided an opportunity to reflect on the various resident-run programs and initiatives that help to create the College's motivating and supportive environment. It also served as encouragement for our freshers, as they entered the first assessment-heavy period of their first semester. W e congratulate all our returning residents on their hard work, both in their dedication to their individual studies, and in creating this unique environment so conducive to residents achieving their academic goals.

An inspirational woman is invited to come and speak about their experiences in both their career and personal life, often sharing advice relevant to their profession. The first Ladies' Lunch for 2022 was held on Friday 6th May and we were delighted to have Jemma Sanderson (1998) as the guest speaker. Jemma lived at College from 1998-2000, and many of her family are Georgians including her sister Krista Sanderson (1997) who also attended the lunch. Along with being the Treasurer of the College Foundation, Jemma is a Director of Cooper Partners Financial Services, heading up their self-managed super fund area. W e asked her to speak to us about financial literacy, future planning, and wealth protection, especially for women in relationships. She had lots of advice for us, the key point being that our ability to work and earn an income is our greatest asset. Thus, having income protection insurance as soon as full time work begins is very important to consider. She also discussed superannuation, advising us to set up an account as soon as possible and choose one with low fees, and to be engaged in selecting the right investment option. Employers are required by law to make contributions towards super, so make sure they are! T o save money, Jemma's advice was to 'save before you spend' and look closely at what you actually need to be spending money on. Jemma has also done some work with Financial T oolbox, and spoke about the importance of having your own bank account and control / access to your own money. Sometimes women become the subject of financial abuse - when all accounts are joint, it can lead to one partner controlling access to money, questioning expenditure and exerting influence given that control. It can be very difficult to leave a relationship without access to money and Jemma has seen the impact of this through her voluntary work. Jemma was a very engaging and interesting speaker and we all really appreciated her expertise and willingness to share her knowledge.

Mark assumed this position in February 2022, joined the Board of St George's College on 30th May 2022, and has been the Chair of the College Music Committee since its inception in 2016. He is one of W estern Australia's leading musicians and music administrators, currently serving as the Artistic Director of the Government House Foundation, and previously as Chief Executive Officer, W est Australian Symphony Orchestra and Head, UW A School of Music. His appointment as the Executive Director of the College's Music program is exciting and his involvement will see the program continue to go from strength to strength. While Covid infections and restrictions caused disruption to the music program this semester a number of musical events in and out of the College were still able to take place. In addition, the Chapel Choir and Chapel Choir Consort rehearsed regularly under the leadership of David W oods (2019), who has become the College's Choral Director. David is also the Music Director of the Newby Blues. The Newby Blues and the Mockingbirds, the College's a cappella groups, performed at a number of Semester One events in and out of College. The first classical concerts were held in Dunsborough and Yallingup in January where audiences were treated to the 'Consort and Fellows' Music at St George's concerts. College Music Fellows Paul Wright and Raymond Y ong and the St George's College Consort gave wonderful and sold-out performances at the St George's Church Community Centre and Cape Lodge. Next was a special concert held in March for Patrons of the College's Music Program. Patrons were treated to performances from some of the College's Acoustic Night in the Chapel Some of the Consort in Dunsborough L-R Ewald Diedericks, Quinn Reid, Adele Cole, David Woods (2019), Phoebe Tait, Aishah Chadwick-Stumpf (2018) 26 27 WINTER 2022Music at St George'sresident musicians, Emma John, Adele Cole and Georgia Mercer, as well as from Mark Coughlan and Raymond Y ong. Acoustics Night organised by the College Club's Arts Representative David Olanrewaju was an atmospheric evening held in the Chapel with College residents very much enjoying a variety of performances from their fellow residents. This was followed by the General Music Formal Dinner, organised by the Arts Rep David Olanrewaju and Phoebe Tait. A highlight on the College's annual calendar of events, the General Music Dinner features College musicians performing for their fellow residents. Performances this year ranged from Breanna Cooke's song about 9/11, Rose Rixon's tribute to her friend, Ewald Diedericks' cover of Bo Burnham's \"W elcome to and Will Cornish's rendition of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\". A particular highlight of the evening was Mark Coughlan performing Chopin on the Fazioli.

W e were delighted to welcome back Dr Emily Alfonsi (2011), Dr Angela Burvill (2014), and Dr Jamie Cransberg (2014) as our invitees. Regrettably, our fourth guest, Dr George Giudice-Nairn (2012) succumbed to Covid-19 on the day; we look forward to including George in a future dinner, medical or musical. Emily works both as a General Practitioner and Cosmetic Physician. She completed her six-year MBBS in 2016 and undertook rotations through King Edward Memorial and Fiona Stanley Hospitals, focusing on Obstetrics and Gynaecology. She worked as a registrar in the emergency department of a Queensland hospital for a year before returning to W estern Australia to pursue GP training. The blend of GP work and cosmetic surgery that she now undertakes matches her varied interests: she enjoys the wide impact and social nature of general practice, the procedures and precision of surgery, and engagement in the development of treatments for body dysmorphia. Jamie is a second-year resident at Royal Perth Hospital working in the State Trauma Unit. She was trained within the Rural Clinical School program and spent a year in Bunbury where, amongst other things, she ended up playing Australian Rules Football, having long resisted a family leaning. Angela is a second-year resident, currently working in the Neurology department at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. She has worked in Port Hedland, and is the Co-President of the Junior Doctors' Society at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Angela and Jamie are the products of the UW A three plus four year program that is still offered but most medical students now pursue an integrated six year program. They both had assured pathways to study for the MD. For their undergraduate degrees Angela and Jamie, respectively, studied maths and economics, and genetics and finance. Both were excellent College tutors in their undergraduate subjects. Although Emily proceeded directly to her medicine studies, she was originally intending to pursue law. As with so many medics, our guests have broad areas of intellectual interest reflecting that combination of disciplines that medicine represents: science, arts, social science, humanities, technological. The evening reflected the outlooks of young medical professionals, greatly helpful to our residents. Their considered observations also certainly had value extending beyond the benefit afforded to our residents. It is interesting to reflect to what extent health departments and health providers have access to the clear- thinking of young and expert practitioners in their fast-changing environments and workplaces. A number of themes emerged during the dinner: standards and attitudes to work; self-management; and regional health; and it concluded with some general matters. Practice of Medicine Dinner L-R Jamie Cransberg (2014), Stella Van Der Zanden, Nicole Carter, Jasmin Perry, Samantha Lee, Lottie Thompson Ben Salmond & Emily Alfonsi (2011) L-R Jack Cross, Angela Burvill (2014), Lily Lockwood-Case 28 29 WINTER 2022Practice of Medicine DinnerEmily summarised that standards were set by reference to a profession that held at its heart the interest of the patient (despite other factors having to intrude) and operated in her experience in a teams-based fashion such that the standard that was sought was that which would be acceptable to a respected professional colleague. As to attitudes our trio contributed 'Medicine is what you make of it.', 'Be a 'Y es' person.', and 'The more you put into the team, the more the team puts into you'. And it was made quite clear that the team extended widely and inclusively. Self-management is an issue in an industry that has often demanded long hours that would not be permitted in mining, aviation, and other industries. Our guests did not complain in this regard but there was comment on the need for effective time and personal management and truly identifying 'what works for you'. Being on night duties for three months self-evidently impacts on friendships, social sport, and the other quotidian activities that revolve around the predominant schedules of standard business hours' workers. All emphasised the importance of regular catch ups with friends whether at breakfast or before night shift. There was also an acknowledgement that friendships seemed almost inevitably to build with fellow health practitioners who understood the rosters and the work. Emily specifically commented that she would have appreciated a mentor as a junior doctor. All strongly promoted the beneficial effects of good physical and mental health on enjoyable and productive work.Despite extensive work obligations, continuing education and community involvement were priorities that had brought considerable reward and satisfaction. It was evident that community contributions - tutoring in schools, playing in sports teams, and arranging collegial activities - were fulfilling and sustaining. In terms of continuing education Jamie is in the midst of a Master of Public Health at UW A; Emily has an array of qualifications in obstetrics and gynaecology, and cosmetic medicine; and Angela reflected on the medical research opportunities that she had pursued related to internal medicine and health policy and economics. Jamie commented on the stimulation of, and encouraged, working overseas; she had undertaken an elective at New Y ork University Tisch Hospital and spoke about the different United States hospital structures. Angela reinforced Jamie's point; she having pursued an elective in Marbella, Spain. Emily added that her time in Queensland had been similarly refreshing and thought-provoking. Regional medical experience had made a significant impression on Angela and Jamie. Jamie elucidated the benefits of her time in Bunbury - all specialties offered, fewer medical students so many more opportunities such as midwifery leading to deliveries. Regional humour also made its valuable mark: the meniscus that she held throughout an operation and was still doing so after closure of the wound, theatre in consternation as to why so and how she proposed re-inserting it, clearly caused more than a little temporary trepidation before the peals of laughter rang out. She found her time in Kalgoorlie sobering and explained the pressures of limited resources for such an enormous catchment that included widely dispersed indigenous communities. Jamie had also worked in Kununurra and was able to draw parallels in relation to telehealth, the major role of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, fly-in fly-out specialisations, and regulations that seemed sometimes to fly in the face of patient circumstances and practical solutions, such as with eligibility for patient transport for those not admitted to hospital. Angela talked of how mindful she was after her Port Hedland rotation of endeavouring not to exhibit the 'Perth pushback' that she had encountered whilst there. Jamie and Angela agreed that their regional time had heightened their capacity to be advocates for their patients when they believed that they should be; they discussed 'sensitivity training', in response to a question, and underlined its necessity but added that on the ground communities were very different and the situation nuanced. The group discussion that concluded the evening focused on the structure of the medical industry and the particular problems that had emerged with Covid-19. It was observed that in W estern Australia the public hospital system is bottom heavy with a preponderance of junior doctors but for whom there was restriction on access to training in some specialty pathways. It was averred that there needs to be a 'widening of the bottleneck' or perhaps 'bottlenecks'. In relation to Covid-19 the travel restrictions had prevented the normal inflow of overseas practitioners. With the reciprocity of W estern Australian and Irish qualifications, in the past, many Irish doctors and nurses have played a substantial role in enabling appropriate staffing levels. The comment that 'W A relies on Ireland for nurses and doctors' did not seem to be wholly made in jest. The support of Georgians for College Academic Committees has been a feature of the past few years, and has been an enriching and singular aspect of College life. W e sincerely thank Drs. Emily Alfonsi, Angela Burvill, and Jamie Cransberg for their continuous support for College residents studying health sciences, of which their generous attendance at this Practice of Medicine Dinner represents one further part. G L-R Henry Openshaw, Heinrich Helm, Jack Cross, Tharushi Pallegedara, Sarah Mazzucchelli 28 29 WINTER 2022Practice of Medicine DinnerKevin Kerr (1999), Andrew Guzzomi (2000), Kenji Li Hee Cheong (2015) and Rachael Honey (2016) were our guests at a Practice of Engineering Dinner held in May, hosted by the Science and Engineering Academic Committee. The speakers ranged from engineering graduates just making a start in their career to those with extensive professional and academic experiences. This included various Senior Leadership and Higher Management roles with industry leaders; contributions to the development and commercialisation of innovative award- winning engineering solutions; and contributions to engineering research and education. Engineering is a discipline applicable to a vast array of practical and technological human endeavours and there will never be a shortage of unique problems and challenges that require precise application of specified knowledge and technical capability. The future of engineering revolves around economical, suitable, and sustainable solutions to these problems, fuelled by technological advancements and guided by environmental considerations. Such resourceful problem solving affords engineers a spectacularly broad and diverse range of career paths and rewarding life experiences. This sentiment was clearly expressed by our guests. Kevin Kerr (1999) was first to share his insights. Senior Student in 2001 and currently a College Board member, he is the Transaction Manager for Mergers and Acquisitions at W oodside Energy, having previously held a variety of positions in W oodside, including a stint working in Karratha. Kevin graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in Oil and Gas from UW A in 2002 and worked at W oodside as a Petroleum Engineer before going to the United Kingdom in 2008 to do an MBA in Strategy and Management at the University of Cambridge. Cambridge celebrated its 800th year of continuous operation in 2009, the same year Kevin graduated. The importance of perennially expanding your conceptual knowledge base and technical capability was central to his recommendations to prospective engineers. He stressed the importance of taking ownership of your career, endorsing a commitment to lifelong formal and informal learning - a recurring theme for the evening. Dr Andrew Guzzomi (2000) was next to share his thoughts. He was a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Bologna in Italy, renowned for being the oldest university in the world - founded circa 1088 and in continuous operation since before the accepted historical foundations of the Mongolian, Ottoman, Aztec, and Incan Empires. Andrew's time at UniBo was primarily spent with the mechanical design and agricultural engineering departments working in collaboration with industry - the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration was central to Andrew's discussion. Prior to his time abroad, Andrew completed his PhD (2007) in powertrain dynamics at UW A, under the supervision of Emeritus Professor Brian Stone. Since returning to UW A in 2011, Andrew has been very busy, with a rap sheet that includes: \u00bbT wo-time recipient of the 'W A Innovator of The Y ear' award, in 2016 for developing seed flamer technology, and in 2019 for developing the W eed Chipper, a revolutionary (or ground- breaking, if you appreciate a good pun) alternative to herbicides for weed management in large scale cropping operations. \u00bbAwarded T all Poppy and 40Under40 Awards in 2018 for his agricultural engineering research at UW A. \u00bbUW A's Inaugural Agricultural Engineer in 2019. \u00bbAustralian Awards for University T eaching, Citation for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning in 2020. \u00bbCo-chair with Professor Sally Male at the first joint Research in Engineering Education Symposium - Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference in 2021. \u00bbFounding Director of the Centre for Engineering Innovation: Agriculture & Ecological Restoration at UW A. Andrew remains UW A's inaugural Agricultural Engineer and is also Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at UW A. Andrew, a pragmatist, spoke of the practical, tangible, and real-world benefits of innovative engineering. He referenced local examples, such as Fremantle Harbour and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme pipeline, both achievements of engineer C. Y. O'Connor, with the latter recognised as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Andrew also spoke to the value of broadening perspectives via full immersion in another culture/country, despite linguistic and cultural challenges. Overall, it is a very rewarding experience. It pushes you to take responsibility of your own career (also advocated by Kevin), and fosters a growth mindset, particularly if challenges are seen as providing opportunities instead of hardships. Andrew used lived experience as an example of things that prepare you to develop confidence and the ability to think critically, and also laterally and with divergent thinking capabilities. These are necessary to successfully engage Practice of Engineering Dinner 1 2 30 31 WINTER 2022Practice of Engineering Dinnerin interdisciplinary collaboration with other professionals, itself an important facilitator of innovation in industry as specialists in other professional fields possess knowledge, skills, and experiences often foreign to the engineer. This can make for demanding, challenging, and even uncomfortable situations without a robust selection of diverse skills and lived experience. It is even more salient with projects and industries involving cooperation on an international scale, and may be crucial in finding unique or exceptional engineering solutions. Following the delicious main course of kangaroo, Kenji Li Hee Cheong (2015) was next to speak. He completed a Bachelor of Science in 2020, Majoring in Engineering Science and Finance, followed by Masters of Professional Engineering (Mechanical.) While he was a student, Kenji took part in several internships, including with Air Mauritius, Thejo Engineering, and ARUP. His internship at ARUP developed into a full-time graduate position on their Perth Building Services team. Kenji is now working on the $57M W estralia Square II project - an 11 storey tower set to be Perth's first hybrid steel-wood high-rise building, and on what will be Perth's tallest building, a 56 storey mixed usage twin-tower at Elizabeth Quay. Kenji said ARUP's view is that Building Services Engineering integrates expertise in mechanical, electrical and public health engineering, with systems designed to support buildings and to create the right environment for the people who use them. It is the Building Services T eam who actually \"bring a building to life\". Comparing it to the human body, Kenji explained that a building also consists of many interconnected complex systems and stages of development. A building, starting with design, does not end when construction is completed. Just as physical bodies must be maintained, modern structures require effort to maintain full operational status. It is very much a collaborative and cooperative effort. Kenji's hot tip for budding engineers was \"don't be shy - be bold and seize every opportunity'. The final speaker was Rachael Honey (2016). Her academic background includes a Bachelor of Science (Engineering and Italian), with Masters in Professional Engineering (Mechanical Engineering). Currently holding a Graduate Mechanical Engineering position at W orley, Rachael also assists the Minerals and Mining Project Support T eam. Along with the other guests, Rachael stressed the importance of continual learning. She was a Project T eam Lead with the UW A Y oung Engineers while she was studying, and she also emphasised the value of vacation work. She encouraged residents to take full advantage of any opportunities that presented themselves. She reiterated that this is one way to reduce knowledge gaps which could result in setbacks to a professional career. Rachael also discussed the importance of seizing opportunities for valuable industry experience - there is much to be gained through time spent on-site and in a workplace environment. Our guests agreed that the engineering landscape is ripe with opportunities for innovative and adaptable individuals capable of thinking critically, and creatively. Engineers must be open to new ideas, experiences, and challenges, and to be willing to take calculated risks. The overarching principle is that careers in engineering must be approached with a growth mindset, embracing personal commitment to continual self-development and life- long learning. This broadens technical understanding and practical capabilities to keep up with an ever-advancing field, where the requisite knowledge base is frequently updated. Regular informal and structured introspective reflection into professional regimens is imperative. W e are grateful to Kevin, Andrew, Kenji, and Rachael for sharing their insights with us. It ensured an intriguing, informative, and inspiring evening and provided an invaluable opportunity for residents interested in a career in engineering to broaden their understanding of what lies ahead. Residents certainly appreciated hearing which strategies and mindsets to incorporate to navigate the professional engineering world properly and effectively.

With previous events having been postponed due to Covid-19, it was exciting to have our first speaker and networking opportunity. Both residents and Georgians were invited to the lecture, which was held in the evening with wine and cheese. At the time, Kate was running as an independent candidate in the federal seat of Curtin. She was successful in her campaign and is now the Member for Curtin. Kate spoke to us about her areas of interest, career path, political platforms, and issues around increasing female representation in parliament and in leadership positions. She spoke largely about her belief in the importance of action on climate change, greater accountability in Federal parliament, and creating more economic opportunities. Kate was happy to answer questions and a large part of her lecture was a question-and-answer session. Questions were asked about the wage rate, her thoughts on the potential conflict between economic and climate concerns, inflation, affordability, and her ties to the Liberal Party. It was a very successful evening, and it was also a great chance for current residents to meet and interact with Georgians. W e thank Kate Chaney for her informative address.

As I approach a change in my nascent career, moving from academia into industry, I find myself reflecting on the many transitions that we experience across our lives. While we experience some of these transitions, such as a change in job, quite vividly and sometimes jarringly; other transitions are more gradual and unfolding. With regards to the latter - gradual transitions - I think of ageing. Now, while I don't doubt that some of the features of age can be quite literally jarring, I feel like our movement through societally constructed categories and stereotypes of different ages goes almost entirely unnoticed by the individual, illuminated only by specific moments of realisation that the transition has occurred. I find myself unconsciously 'othering' individuals I once saw as part of 'us'; I am surprised to find that I identify more with the fictional parents in the novels I read, frustrated by the whiney self- entitled teenager who I almost certainly stared at in the mirror during my high school years. I think we all have these experiences, whether it's the realisation that the na\u00efve fresher has become the wise second-year college resident; the whiny teenager has become the aspirational parent; or any of the many other shifts that occur throughout our lives, seemingly without us knowing. Psychologically and neurologically, our brains are built to 'other', to build social categories such as 'young' and 'old', within which we place ourselves and others, and with which we move through our lives subconsciously reinforcing the stereotypes we attach to these categories. While there's plenty of room for evolving or completely shedding these stereotypes, I still think it's important to remind ourselves that we are fundamentally this way inclined in the first instance. Why on earth does any of this matter to Georgians? Good question. Because I think this makes the Georgian community even more worthy of cherishing, nurturing, and growing - as a place where individuals who may otherwise find themselves on opposite sides of socially-constructed divides (based on age, gender, cultural background, sexuality, or any other characteristic) can come together due to a common experience at a wonderful college. Where we can simultaneously feel 'known' and understood due to this common experience and, at the same time, find a further education of sorts in exploring each other's unique experiences - or, at the very least, share some laughs over a glass of wine. T o this end... In February a lovely group of Georgians gathered for the Georgian AGM . I was re-elected as President and, much more excitingly, the addition of several new committee members was approved, including Alison W eller (1982), Claire Wilkinson (1991), Mark Dodd (2006), Alex W ood (2007), Eden Munro (2015), John Dowey (2017) and Olivia Riches (2018). In May the annual City Lunch was held, seeing 22 Georgians catching up whilst partaking in some delicious food and drinks at Tiisch in the Perth CBD. And there are plenty of other occasions to look forward to this year. T o complement the City Lunch, in August this year the City Drinks will be held for the second time, following on from the success of last year's event, which saw 60 Georgians gather at Stables for some after-work drinks. W e will also repeat the W omen's Networking Event, likely in October, as an opportunity for female and non-binary residents and Georgians to catch up and build or strengthen their connections. In November a 40 Y ear Reunion for Georgians who lived at the College in 1981 or 1982 will be held, as will the 50 Y ear Club Lunch, for all Georgians who lived at the College 50 years ago or more. Finally, in our continued efforts to evolve the much-loved Cocktail Party, and to accommodate the substantial wear and tear it places on the Dining Hall floors, we will trial holding the event earlier in the year. This means that the next Cocktail Party will be in February 2023. W e hope that the other events on offer this year are sufficient to placate your party needs, and we look forward to seeing you at the Summer Cocktail Party in 2023. As always, I'm always up for a chat and open to feedback. Please do reach out. On that note: The Committee is interested in conducting a series of interviews with Georgians about their time at College - for archival and promotional purposes. If this is something that you would be willing to spare some time for, even if it is only for a 30 minute chat, please do let Jo know.

But more accurately it provided community, friendships, and opportunities which continue to this day. W e had so much fun while we were there and cherish the great friendships we made. After leaving College and graduating from UW A, we accepted graduate roles in Perth. I took a role in consulting and corporate finance at Paxon Group travelled extensively around Australia, and Grace was in corporate law at Herbert Smith Freehills where she worked across Seoul and Singapore in international arbitration. Although we enjoyed pursuing careers in law and consulting, we also had a global outlook on life, valuing travel and new experiences. Throughout our relationship, I would run my crazy start- up ideas past Grace while she quizzed me on specifics and thought through whether it had legs or not. It was our own mini Shark Tank and, in hindsight, was great preparation for investor pitches in the future. In 2018 I had one of those ideas while watching the first One Day International cricket match at the then-new Perth Stadium. I was buying a round for my mates and missed a historic event; the first streaker to cross our beautiful ground. I spent the rest of the afternoon lamenting the missed experience. I started to think about how great it would be if there was an app that let you order food and drinks from your phone and have them delivered to you without you having to leave your seat and miss the action. The next day I sat down to run some numbers against the unit economics of mobile ordering in stadiums. After talking it through with Grace, we agreed that it was a great idea and that was how Snackr was born. W e started humbly, working nights and weekends on Snackr while continuing our jobs, but it didn't take long to realise that a part-time venture was never going to succeed. In late 2019 we landed our first client in Tasmania, so we seized the opportunity to move to Hobart, taking a period of extended leave from our jobs. W e were all set to launch in March 2020 when the global pandemic forced live events to shut down for almost two years. Grace and I stayed in Hobart for almost a year and were lucky enough to be able to work remotely for our employers during this time - we had an inkling that if we went home before the launch, Snackr would fail. Finally, in December 2020, we launched Snackr during the T20 cricket and the results we saw effectively forced our hand; we had to quit our jobs and give Snackr our all. Georgian Innovations: Snackr Grace Tate (2011) and I are both from the South West region of Western Australia - Busselton and Bunbury respectively. We grew up only 20 minutes apart from each other, but we had never met until we both lived at St George's College. I had been at St George's for a year in 2010 when Grace came along in 2011 after taking a gap year in Busselton. We were both studying a Bachelor of Laws and Arts at UWA and met during Orientation Week at College.

Despite setbacks caused by the pandemic, we have raised around $1.5 million in capital (including venture capital investment) and developed a sought after and highly scalable product that solves a specific problem in a $100 billion market. W e have piloted our product in venues across Australia and our next challenge is to expand into the much bigger market in the UK. W e were recently selected as a delegate for the UK Government's Australian and New Zealand trade mission to London and we're looking forward to bringing Snackr to sports fans in the UK. Looking back, our journey as a team started when we met at St George's. W e both went to College to attend university, to meet friends and to have fun, but what we also found was a culture of collegiality, an environment of collaboration and learning and a deep connection to an amazing alumni. Like-minded people surrounded us, many of whom we still count as our best friends today, and that community has continued to help us every step of the way. Through Snackr, we have learned an immense amount, shared ecstatic highs, and also failed spectacularly. It has challenged us, and our relationship, but through this shared endeavour we have raised the ceiling on what we can achieve and strengthened our partnership. Neither of us would have been able to achieve what we have with Snackr if not for our ability to work together or complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. People often comment on how they couldn't work with their partner and that they 'don't know how we do it'. The response is that it doesn't just happen, we constantly work on it, improve how we communicate and try to be empathetic. That iterative approach, even though we didn't know it at the time, really started during our time at College as we collaborated on assignments and studied together. W e have been lucky enough to find each other at an early age and share many wonderful experiences together. And although founding a start-up is inherently uncertain and trying to scale it has been extremely challenging, it has never been clearer that we are exactly where we should be.

T ertle and his contribution to the menu card for the 38th College Dinner. Around the time in question, as editor of The Dragon I had the pleasure of interviewing an expansive 'A. de Q.' on a wide range of matters during which he suggested a quote for the traditional blank page for signatures on the back of the forthcoming College Dinner menu card, the production of which I was somehow responsible. A. de Q.'s initial suggestion was 'Arts students may sign their names, engineers make a cross', but he quickly extended the scope of offence by replacing 'engineers' with 'others'. The interview was never printed. A. de Q's opinions were too contentious and his quote on the menu card was the only thing to survive. My recollection will be of little help in the search for this Lost Georgian but others will have their own memories of A. de Q, I'm sure. Ian Royce (1967)Dear Editor, In Search of a Lost Georgian 38 39 WINTER 2022The Little DragonIn Search of a Lost Georgian: Aubrey de Quentonville T ertleThe Georgian is deeply saddened to learn that Aubrey de Quentonville T ertle (1967) was likely killed in an accident in 2021. Few Georgians ever met him because of his great secrecy. He lived in one of the rooms in the tower but no-one was ever sure which. Those who thought they met him on dark nights have been unable to give much information about him. There are rumours that he had an acute sense of taste, and suffered from leg twitching. W e have pieced together his life story from Google searches of the names \"Aubrey\" and \"T ertle\", though there is a degree of uncertainty because Aubrey is also a girl's name and the word T ertle brings up a lot of search results which cannot all be attributed to Aubrey. Aubrey grew up on a farm in the Wheatbelt (which he called the \"small pond\"), before coming to St George's (which he called the \"big pond\") on a scholarship to study insects. He was known for his long legs and soprano voice and he could sometimes be heard singing in a quartet (singing all parts at the same time). His main achievement at College was his 2nd place in swimming underwater in 1967 , as recorded in the Dragon of that year. After leaving College at the end of 1969, Aubrey was at a loose end. He was not inclined to a career in biology, partly because he attended no lectures but mainly because of his secrecy. Relatives say he was the first of the T ertle family to hop across the Nullarbor to Melbourne, working in bars serving water to earn his keep. In Melbourne Aubrey had several delivery jobs, provided the distances were short and the loads light. He was a resident at Trinity College, our sister College in the University of Melbourne but was frankly overwhelmed by the bigger pond of the Eastern States. He did not forget his time at St George's sending a letter to The Georgian from Trinity with advice on how to get rid of moths from students' rooms. Always restless, Aubrey looked overseas for opportunities. From our research we have definitively ascertained that he obtained training to remove Vale Aubrey de Quentonville Tertle (1967) (1949 - 2021) locusts during plagues, achieving an astonishing rate of one per second. There is no record of Aubrey having married, or even having sexual relations, despite his leg twitches. W e can only imagine that he lived a modest life, avoiding the camera, as he did at College, there are no still or moving images of him from these years. W e have translated a Moldavian report of Aubrey having been sadly flattened as he tried to cross the Muncesti freeway. Aubrey was apparently halfway across when a police bicycle ran over him, killing him instantly. For someone so secretive, he did purportedly leave a letter asking that his body be donated for Moldovan scientists to study. It is true that Aubrey has been an enigma to most. However, Georgians will be happy to know that he lived an extraordinary life, inspired by his years at College.

With John Dunne, the folk of W A's far north-eastern Wheatbelt community of Beacon got the full deal. His grasp of agriculture, with its environmental as well as commercial imperatives, helped hundreds of people. His family property, Parakeelya, was a hub for discussion, advice and good animal husbandry. As for the fun element, the town's band, The Deliberate Sounds, had John as lead singer and rhythm guitarist. Despite the hours spent listening to tapes, to pick up words of songs, he would sometimes veer off into his own version while the dance floor reverberated to at least 60 movers and shakers. The evenings would start with waltzes and foxtrots, and rev up to what the mature citizens termed \"head banging stuff\". John was also a stalwart of Beacon's Theatre Arts Club, which put on annual shows under the banner \"Wine and Dine\". A meal was served between skits that drew heavily on TV comedy including Monty Python's Flying Circus. Rehearsals were a riot, all agreed. As for the final product . . . if you were seeking something deep and meaningful, you were in the wrong place. John did, however, do much more than bring on laughter and applause while delivering classic numbers such as The House of the Rising Sun. He studied the problem of rising salt, taking the business of salinity and other agricultural challenges seriously. He had the intellectual energy for intense lobbying, as well as hours of dedicated research that led to reports and feasibility studies. One prime achievement was getting a paid Landcare officer into Beacon, with a house, office and vehicle supplied. This had benefits for farms well beyond the town.The Dunne family have been part of Beacon for almost a century. John Forrest Dunne was born on 16 June 1946 at Kununoppin, 80km south of Beacon, third child of Janet (nee Forrest) and Harry Dunne; Janet was related to Bunbury-born Sir John Forrest, W A's first premier and member of Australia's first federal cabinet. The Dunnes' home, Parakeelya, was named after a succulent native plant found in bushland over a large area of W A. In the 1950s, while John was growing up and attending Beacon primary, the town had only a generator for electricity. Roads were clay, sand or gravel; a post office and store supplied basics. Growth, however, was in the wind. Marilyn Dunne (nee Mitchell), who married John in 1967 , says \"land was opened up to the north...people with energy and optimism came, and Beacon took on a new look. School numbers swelled to 120. W e got a town hall, more businesses, a Silver Chain nursing post and country club. Harry Dunne was strongly involved in all this progress.\" John's secondary schooling was as a boarder at Guildford Grammar, where rowing was one of his major activities. Regattas were described in minute detail in letters home. He then enrolled in agricultural science at The University of W estern Australia, but the call of home proved too strong. After one year, living at St George's College, he returned to Beacon and stayed for life. Everything about sheep interested him, but as well as \"ram-and-wool talk\" he was interested in broader issues. That was one reason he ran as an independent for the federal seat of O'Connor in 1993. During the 14 years he served on the Mount Marshall Shire Council, based at Bencubbin, 50km to the south, he proved his enormous determination. \"Always well-prepared . . . had done his homework,\" resident Jenni Bunce, whose time as a councillor coincided with his. \"T ourism, buildings, even the state of the footpaths - he was always working for improvements. And saving our barracks from demolition was thanks to his tireless talent for a campaign.\" John was president for many years of the Mt Marshall Land Care District Committee (MMLCDC), and a forceful member of the Avon W orking Group which became the Wheatbelt Catchment Alliance. He added a new dimension to the concept of \"voluntary\". A diagnosis of serious illness was a severe setback, but his spirits remained high. In his last few weeks, Beacon's \"Mr Fixer\" was busy with a faulty fridge. John Dunne died on 25 March, survived by Marilyn, their daughter, Catherine, sons, Andrew, Michael and David, 11 grandchildren and one great- grandchild; and by John's brothers, William (1958) and Allan (1971), both of whom are also Georgians. Hundreds attended his funeral in Beacon's overflowing town hall. All miss the man who took his blue 1927 Chevrolet to the football oval on match days, collecting gate fees on behalf of the sports fraternity. Beacon's barracks, where railway staff used to be accommodated while on the run east to Bonnie Rock, is only one of John's legacies. Since the line closed, it has housed visitors including backpackers, shearers and arts groups. An outcrop is why the town used to be known as Beacon Rock. John was Beacon's rock and roll, especially when the hall was humming to The Deliberate Sounds belting out Running Bear one more time. Patrick Cornish, obituary writer for The W est Australian newspaper in Perth, wrote this tribute to John Dunne 40 41 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV aleNeil Donaldson OAM (1954) 1936-2022 The passing of Neil saddens us as we reflect on a colourful life. Neil's outstanding Hale career began in 1949 and included being a School Prefect, a very good sportsman and a top student. Neli was the proxime accessit (runner -up to the Dux of School) in 1953 and he also won the prize for his outstanding contribution to the life of the school. Though at UW A as a student he was uninspired, his years at St Goerge's were significant. His service to the College Club Committee and his ability to organise major events were most important. His leadership with regard to College Balls and especially the Jubilee Ball (where there were five dance floors in the Quad plus brilliant floral and lighting decorations) was spectacular. Sure, having a fridge made Neil popular but he loved College life, worked so hard for the Jubilee celebrations and deservedly won the Georgians Prize in 1956. Neil was a great servant of the Amateur Football body, he was involved in all areas and including at times Chairman of the Tribunal. For the University Football Club as an accomplished player, a winning coach, the President many times, the Patron for years and number one supporter across the years, his involvement was amazing. Intervarsity games were incredible and Neil virtually organised the highly successful carnivals in Perth in 1959 and 1964. As well Neil always stressed in his coaching the enjoyment of the game. He wanted to win but 'having a great time with mates on and off the ground was everything.' Neil's printing company did very well. His cheerful, thorough, totally honest style was so much appreciated. Even when in later years he no longer owned the company the fact that Neil continued to work for the company with skill and dedication was a major reason for the company's continued success.In 1965 Neil and Jan Blackman were married at the St George's College Chapel followed by a superb reception at the famous 'Seacrest'. Though Neil and Jan were always a terrific couple, Jan at times was not well. Jan showed great courage and Neil was a wonderful carer. In 2006 at Neil's 70th birthday party a most emotional Jan paid a beautiful tribute to 'her Neilo'. They were so good for each other - a special team! Sadly, Neil lost Jan in 2007 . Neil did so much. Always his cheerful most pleasant and interested manner shone through. He inspired us all via the enjoyment he had and the enjoyment he created. His bubbly personality, his lively conversation on all matters, his entertaining speeches and his great sense of fun will be missed. Now we are sad at his passing and of course we send sincere condolences to Neil's family. Now we all have our own great stories and memories of Neil's life. I go back to 1953 at Hale when Neil Donaldson was the star of Bernard Shaw's famous play \"Arms and the Man\". As Captain Bluntschli Neil was the dashing cavalier soldier, a charmer, a thinker and a doer. In so many ways Neil was Captain Bluntschli throughout his life - a man of action, often an inspiration and someone who affected so many. There are stories galore! All of us will always remember Neil. Alistair Macmillan (1956) I met Neil when I joined the University Football Club in 2018 for the first season of women's football in the Perth Football League. As a passionate advocate for the game, Neil was instrumental in the creation of this women's league. As manager of the A Grade team, Neil was at every training and every game, briefcase in hand to give out shirts and look after our valuables while we played. He was always ready to give a supportive smile, a good piece of advice or even a bit of a rev up when needed. Neil was as dedicated and supportive as anyone, and a great servant of the UFC. He taught us to honour the jumper and to love the game, but most importantly, he taught us that while good clubs can produce champions, great clubs can become family. Neil never had children of his own, but so many in his life considered him family. He once told us that the club had given him sons and grandsons, and that the creation of the women's team had finally given him granddaughters. Neil was certainly as loved as any grandfather. With the home ground of the University Football Club soon to be upgraded, the new club pavilion will be named in his honour. It is a fitting tribute to a man who was a central, uniting point for this community for decades. While Neil obviously loved footy, he was also the true embodiment of the fact that what makes any club or sport truly special is the people. Knowing that Neil was a Georgian and that we have called the same place home, even if it was 60 years apart, has made my time here mean so much more. In my experience, that was one of Neil's great strengths, to make people feel special. It is a special thing to find a family outside of the one you are born with, and rare indeed to have this happen more than once. I am truly grateful to have shared not one but two of these families with Neil and I know that while both miss him greatly, we are all so much the richer to be able to call him one of us. Cassie Howell Cassie Howell & Neil Donaldson (1954) 42 43 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV aleRay Piesse (1945) 1927-2022 Ray Piesse was born in 1927 , the eldest of four children, to Mavis and Selby Piesse in Wagin. The Piesse family were a well-known pioneering family in the district, Frederick Piesse having established the town of Katanning in the 1880s. Selby was a farm manager through the tough years of The Great Depression and ten years of drought. V ery early on Ray realised that farming was not for him. Although his parents encouraged their sons to seek alternative careers elsewhere, leaving was not easy given the lack of educational resources in the area. He attended the local one room, one teacher school in a paddock halfway between Wagin and Arthur River then won a scholarship to Albany High School which offered university entrance level education. Exhibiting signs of what was to come, he was School Captain, Dux, and editor of the school magazine Boronia. W orld War II ended the year he completed high school, so instead of joining the air force, he was awarded a Commonwealth University Training Scheme grant. This enabled him to live at St George's College while studying science at UW A. He supplemented this by picking grapes, harvesting, and working on wheat silos. After graduating in 1948 the lack of jobs for scientists in W A saw him move to Sydney for a job with the then named Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories at the Department of Health, where he remained for his entire working life. The Labs were responsible for the design, manufacture and supply of hearing tests and hearing aids to all Australian children and war veterans who needed them. Ray's expertise was in acoustic event measurement and electronic circuitry design to make acoustic events happen. He was soon involved in designing Australia's first hearing aid, the Calaid. He set up the equipment and testing procedures for the new aid and ensured the technicians employed in each State knew how to use it. The first Calaid was valve technology, needing two batteries, large, expensive and unreliable. In 1955 Ray designed the first transistor Calaid, a much smaller, more powerful and reliable version, known as the Calaid T, and needing only one penlight battery. In the early 1960s, with new technology in microphones, earphones, amplification and batteries, Ray designed a new range of hearing aids. These were all in the ear instead of worn in the shirt pocket or hooked on a shoulder strap and were more discreet. Ray's new aid took off like wildfire, and the Lab was, by some years, the only government service in the world to supply an all in the ear aid. The Calaid E, introduced in 1965, met all requirements until the mid 1970s and thousands of them were fitted. Aside from the cosmetic value this new aid carried advantages which, initially, Ray was one of the few to understand. W earing the microphone on the head meant the wearer could hear a much wider range of sound frequencies, and thus had much better understanding of speech and a greater appreciation of the world. When the aid was first introduced Ray made this knowledge available to the Laboratory staff, particularly the audiologists. In 1967 Ray was appointed the Director of the Laboratories. Within a few months the Government announced that it would provide free hearing aids to all pensioners and their dependents and the Acoustic Laboratory would be expanded from distributing 2,000 hearing aids a year to 30,000 a year. The announcement was made in August 1967 with the start date in April 1968. Many things had to happen quickly: get and train staff to the equivalent of master's academic level; get and train administrative staff and technicians; find electronic engineers; devise administrative procedures; obtain supplies of hearing aids and spares and hearing test equipment in amounts never before requested by anyone in the world. Somehow the new Director managed it. Ray built up a service delivery of 75,000 Acoustic Laboratory designed, Australian made hearing aids a year. He backed this up with an audiology research and development unit which soon led the world. He introduced and supervised the design and Australian manufacture of the world's most sophisticated hearing test equipment and supervised the introduction of the audiology profession into Australia. A humble, thoughtful, calm, quiet man, he felt that he was fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time, but he also had the ambition, determination, courage and resilience he needed to fulfil his dreams. There was little Ray could not do or had not tried. From building carports to kitchens and compost heaps, he was an expert home renovator, gardener and landscaper. He tried the guitar, painting, pastels, bronze sculpting, silver jewellery making, camping trips, golf, tennis, skiing and absolutely loved body surfing. He loved wine and good food as well as music which he enjoyed on a sound system he created and installed himself. Ray's first two albums were an eclectic mix: \"With the Beatles\" and opera arias sung by Dame Joan Sutherland In 1955 he married Therese Nicholson, a marriage which lasted 47 years and produced four children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Therese died in 2002 and he later married Patricia Birch. Ray and Pat were regular attenders at Georgian Dinners in Sydney. He will be sadly missed. With thanks to Laurie Upfold and Caroline Riley 42 43 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV ale V aleDavid Irvine (1969) 1947-2022 In the days following David Irvine's passing on March 30, the tributes were many. Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of him as \"an exceptional\" public servant, someone whose \"curiosity, wisdom and judgment strengthened our democracy and security over many decades\". The Treasurer Josh Frydenberg described David as \"a person of the utmost decency, always professional, highly capable and deeply committed to serving his country\". The leader of the opposition, Anthony Albanese, described David as \"a giant of the public service\". The former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, said that \"over the course of his career, David was instrumental in decisions that have kept our nation secure, prosperous and free. He was a kind, generous, reflective, insightful man, a rock-solid friend in good times and bad. And a passionately professional diplomat, a leader in our intelligence community and, above all, a proud public servant of Australia\". After setting out to explore the professional person behind those words, and speaking to many friends and colleagues in each of the organisations in which David worked, to sister organisations overseas and to former prime ministers, ministers and members of Parliament, the conclusion is: the David each of us knew is the David all of us knew. The David who arrived in Canberra with Robin in January 1970 is very much the same David we are celebrating today. It is almost as if David was destined to be a senior diplomat \u2014 High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and Ambassador to China \u2014 to be the only person to head up both ASIS and ASIO and, in supposed retirement, to chair the Foreign Investment Review Board.David's stature, his quizzical smile, his raised eyebrows, his unique sartorial sense \u2014 the striped tie, the double-breasters, the handkerchief in the top pocket \u2014 all this conveyed a natural elegance, a certain cultured grace. Y et there was always as well the humour, the penetrating wit, the ready self-effacement. He was a down-to-earth person: he took his job seriously, but himself less so. In a delightful speech to the Melbourne Dining Club in mid 2010, David spoke of his journey from \"junior diplomat\" to \"elderly spook.\" \"I started my diplomatic career as an innocent in Rome,\" he said, \"where I sought to understand the wet spaghetti of Italian politics. I used to boast that I wrote the best political and economic reports ever sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is a boast that nobody has ever been able to deny because, to this day, nobody has ever read them.\" In the same speech, David described himself as a \"linguistic geriatric\" when, at the age of 34, he was sent off to learn Chinese. As a friend there was none better. Sue Boyd, a friend of both Robin and David since David's days at The University of W estern Australia, captured it best: \"David was simply a constant, loyal and thoughtful friend.\" David was always generous with his friends. He was seen as the glue of the 1970 External Affairs intake. In later years, he and Robin generously hosted friends at a holiday villa in Italy, where their warm hospitality was shared with a remarkable array of people, like former heads of MI6 and other intelligence services. Always one to see the funny side of the serious, David once confided that on one occasion when he got up to leave after a promotions interview he opened the wrong door and stepped into a closet instead of the hallway. Asked what he did then, David smiled, and said he simply commented to the committee that it was more usual to be coming out of the closet!But his sense of humour could be mischievous, as his close friend Colin Heseltine discovered in Hong Kong when David put him into a taxi, then threw in a durian and took off. Those who know the impact of durian on the olfactory senses will understand Colin's discomfort \u2014 and David's mirth. David worked hard, very hard, often through the night in the company of a good red wine. But he was not single-tracked: equally at home discussing classical music; sport; the history, culture, people and politics of a diverse range of countries; and Australia's geostrategic challenges, David was a man for all seasons, always good company. In the workplace, David was a mentor, a fine communicator, a calm leader, with balance and perspective, always ethical \u2014 and more at ease with technology than most of his generation. The one thing he could not abide was impediments to providing the best possible advice to government. David had a great eye for talent. In 1984, when Richard Rigby was in Beijing interpreting for Prime Minister Bob Hawke, David asked Richard whether he had met \"the young blonde kid\", as \"we will all be working for him one day\" \u2014 a reference of course to future prime minister Kevin Rudd. Subsequently, David became godfather to Nicholas Rudd. At the christening, David asked the celebrant whether all new babies looked like Winston Churchill, to which the good cleric replied that he discouraged babies from smoking cigars. Divinely inspired wit, said David, had trumped his earthly banter. David sent Nicholas a gift every year thereafter, one of which was a set of Churchill's A History of the English Speaking Peoples. David never just did his job. He immersed himself in it, always seeking deeper understanding. Not for him a mere descriptive account of what was going on: he needed to get behind it. 44 45 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV ale V aleSo it was that on posting as Deputy Head of Mission in Jakarta between 1988 and 1990, David wrote two books about the culture of Indonesia. One, Leather Gods and W ooden Heroes, explained the philosophical and ethical foundations of the traditional Javanese wayang puppetry, one of Indonesia's most sophisticated art forms. His Ambassador at the time, Philip Flood, has said David's book, widely acclaimed in Indonesia, was the equivalent of translating Shakespeare into Bahasa, with commentary. As a former chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Anthony Byrne, said: \"David's world was one of great colour, texture, movement, nuance and complexity. A world analysed and explained in all its facets and from every angle and from a great mind matched with a huge heart.\" David's deep immersion in that which engaged him professionally continued in his formal retirement as a director of the Cyber Security Research Centre and patron of the Australian Professional Intelligence Officers Association.David worked equally well with both sides of politics: appointed to PNG by Labor, to China and ASIS by the Coalition, to ASIO by Labor and to the FIRB by the Coalition. For him, non- partisanship was essential to his role as a public servant. David's professional achievements are too many to recount in full, but some demand mention: While in PNG between 1995 and 1999, David was central to Australia's handling of the Sandland crisis, a defining moment in that country's history. The then-foreign minister, Alexander Downer, describes David in that context as \"simply a wise, calm voice\". In China between 2000 and 2003, David oversaw Australia's first historic LNG contract with that country, a role which was recognised in his award of the Order of Australia. As Director-General of ASIS between 2003 and 2009, he continued Allan Taylor's work in building that agency's counter-terrorism capability, growing its overseas network extensively.Vale We extend our condolences to the family and friends of the following Georgians and Friends of the College: Dr John Brine (1943) Dr Harold Clough AO OBE CitWA Neil Donaldson OAM (1954) John Dunne (1964) Ken Eastman (1957) Dr H.

As Chairman of the FIRB, he led major reforms that strengthened the framework in relation to national security risks and compliance. In doing so, he recognised the importance of ensuring that a regulatory balance was struck so that bureaucracy did not get in the way unnecessarily of business. Robin was very much a part of all David was \u2014 and all that he achieved. No one would doubt the importance of his wonderful partnership with her to David's success. For his children and grandchildren, he was not only the person they knew and loved as father and grandfather, but he was also a man who deserved all those tributes that prime ministers and others have paid. He served his country, and served it well. This obituary is adapted from a eulogy delivered at David Irvine's funeral by Ric Smith, and composed by Ric Smith and Dennis Richardson. 44 45 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV aleHenry David Evans (1959) 1941-2022 David Evans was born in Perth in 1941, the third of four sons of Bill and Flower Evans. David's family home had previously been the stables of his great aunt Bessie Rischbieth's residence next door, before being extended and converted to a house by Marshall Clifton. Bessie was a pioneering campaigner for women and children's rights and an environmentalist who was a great influence on David's political and intellectual aspirations. He attended Christ Church Grammar School on a scholarship. Highlights of David's school days include being stroke in the First VIII which won Christ Church's first ever Head of the River in 1958 and playing the role of Pooh-Bah in the school production of Gilbert & Sullivan's Mikado. A Commonwealth Scholarship allowed him to live at St George's from 1959-1962 while completing his Bachelor of Economics with Honours at UW A. A favourite story of a prank he pulled was the time he set the pond on fire, causing much confusion and concern to his fellow residents who were coming out of the Junior Common Room after perhaps one or two wines followed by port. After graduation he worked as a research assistant on the cost-benefit ratios of two large dams, first with the UW A Economics Department on the Ord River Dam complex and second with the W orld Bank on the Tarbela Dam in W est Pakistan. David felt that the economic benefits for both investments were grossly overstated and the decision to build was based on political rather than economic considerations thus undermining cost-benefit analysis as a tool for economic policy making. His next step was Harvard University on a Fulbright Scholarship, as well as the Frank Knox Memorial Scholarship and a Hackett Bursary, to do his PhD in economics.David was an international development economist who saw economics as a tool for furthering humanity's welfare. His PhD was about Australia's policy of high protection of manufacturing industries against imports \u2014 a major economic and political issue at the time, particularly how to transition from high to low protection. There were concerns about the prospects for those employed in protected manufacturing industries such as footwear, textiles, clothing and motor vehicles. David tackled this in his thesis with a pioneering application of the emerging technique of general equilibrium modelling. This incorporated input- output modelling developed by the 1973 winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Wassily Leontief, who also happened to be David's PhD supervisor. David's modelling showed that lowering protection would reduce the value of the Australian dollar, benefitting export activity in mining, agriculture and the internationally competitive parts of manufacturing. Australian households would benefit from lower priced, higher quality consumer goods. And there would be employment opportunities for workers displaced by increased imports. From 1975 Australia gradually made the transition and now has a low-protection, high- income economy. Starting with David's work, Australia has become a leading contributor to world-wide research on general equilibrium modelling. David returned to Australia from Harvard in the late 1960s to take up a lectureship in Economics at Monash University in Melbourne, but with his passionate stance on political issues, especially the Vietnam War, David felt uncomfortable in the conservative Australia of the early 1970s. He left Australia in 1973 and moved to England where he joined the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex to teach and carry out research. From the 1970s to the 2000s, IDS was deeply engaged in dynamic dialogue with the IMF and W orld Bank. The Bank increasingly added poverty reduction to its central aim of economic growth but it sought to achieve this by liberalisation of internal and external economic policies. IDS was sceptical about aspects of this, especially about whether they advanced the position of the poor. David was ideally placed to guide, direct and refine IDS's contribution to the dialogue. David's career began with rigorous economic modelling of trade and its consequences, and throughout his life he reverted to these issues. He was the first to incorporate gender dimensions into models of trade outcomes. With flexibility and innovativeness, he incorporated considerations of relative power and organisation of the trading participants. He used theories of \"unequal exchange\" to stress-test and modify the optimistic conclusions of neo-classical modelling. This may sound abstract, but the applications were concrete and the consequences for the debate substantial - the Bank (and the IMF) are now more concerned that aspects of liberalisation and globalisation may harm the poor by sharply increasing inequality. David was instrumental in these achievements. He took a collegiate approach, happily reading and commenting on others' work. He was a first-class teacher, supervisor and confidant. Outside of work David was passionate about sailing and swimming and he very much enjoyed singing in a choir and attending the opera at Glyndebourne. In later years he and his partner Jill took regular trips to W estern Australia to see family and friends and for regular reunions with the 1958 Christ Church First VIII crew. He made visits to the College and was pleased that two nieces, a nephew and two great-nieces also shared his wonderful experiences of living at St George's. David is greatly missed by his partner Jill and sons Ben and Simon and their families. With thanks to Jill Goldman, Ben Evans, Peter B. Dixon, Michael Lipton and Susie Hester 46 47 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV ale V aleNews & VisitorsStay in touch If you have any news or photos you would like to share with fellow Georgians, please email jevans@stgc.uwa.edu.au or contact the College Office on (08) 9449 5555. Congratulations to Michael Feutrill SC (1990) who has been appointed as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. He began his career in 1997 as a solicitor at Cocks Macnish and then at Herbert Smith Freehills. After joining the Bar, Mike spent two years as an advocate with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer's international arbitration group in Paris. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the UWA Law School.Congratulations to Dr John Gladstones (1950) who was made an Officer (AO) in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours List. He received the award for distinguished service to primary industry, particularly agriculture and viticulture, and as an author. Amongst his many achievements, John's research established narrow- leafed lupins as a viable stock feed crop. His research also suggested that the Margaret River region could produce premium wines - fellow Georgian Kevin Cullen (1940) was one of the first people to take his advice. Congratulations to Georgian Hamish Coates (2008) and the team at Rocky Ridge Brewing Co who were the WA winners of the Promoting Sustainability Award in the 2022 Telstra Best of Business Awards. Rocky Ridge also won several awards, including the trophy for Champion large brewery, at the recent Perth Royal Beer Awards, established by the Royal Agricultural Society of WA in 2007 to promote and celebrate the beer industry. Congratulations to Nadine Eva (Morgan 1993) who was finally able to collect her bottles of Mann sparkling wine which she won for completing the Georgian survey in 2020. Covid restrictions combined with the fact that Nadine lives in Three Springs had made it difficult for her to collect her prize earlier. It was great to see Russell O'Callaghan (1982) when he popped in to the College to say hello while he was back in Perth earlier this year. Joanna Seymour (Ladyman 1992) and Sophie Seymour visited the College in April - it was Joey's first visit back in many years. We look forward to seeing her, and Ian Seymour (1988), more often when Sophie becomes a resident in 2023. 46 47 WINTER 2022The Little DragonV ale News & VisitorsVale Harold Clough The College was sad to hear of the passing of one of our Honorary Fellows, Harold Clough. He was a long time supporter of St George's, most recently in the provision of the Clough Music Scholarship. The Scholarships have provided enormous support to young musicians studying music at the Conservatorium at UWA and at WAAPA. He will be greatly missed. His legacy will be long appreciated. Pictured above from left to right are Honorary Fellow Alex Cohen, Warden Ian Hardy, Honorary Fellow Harold Clough and Peter Knight (1956) in September 2016. This visit to the College coincided with Alex and Harold's 90th birthdays which were both celebrated that month. Robert Graham (1989) visited the College recently to accompany current resident Georgia Mercer on the piano for a recorded audition. Georgia is a soprano who is studying Voice at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, and Robert is a professional pianist, singer and songwriter.Congratulations to three Georgians who are finalists in the 2022 WA Rural Health Awards: Assoc Prof Angus Turner (1995) - finalist in the Specialist of the Year (Non- GP) category (Lions Outback Vision, North West Eye Hub, Broome) Dr Alec Disley (2014) - finalist in the WA Country Health Service Intern of the Year category (WA Country Health Service, Albany) Dr Fiona Spencer (2012) - finalist in the WA Country Health Service Resident Medical Officer of the Year category (WA Country Health Service, Bunbury)West Australian Opera has awarded Bendat Scholarships to four of their Wesfarmers Arts Young Artists, including Kate McNamara (Oliver 2011). As a Bendat Scholar, Kate will receive funds to support her development as an emerging professional within the operatic landscape, enriching her ongoing opportunities as a Wesfarmers Arts Young Artist. Kate will be conducting West Australian Opera's world premiere production of \"Our Little Inventor\" at His Majesty's Theatre in Perth this October. Mark Stickells (1988) was featured in The West Australian's \"Wine with Ray Jordan\" article in April. Mark, who is executive director of the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, had his photo taken for the article at the College because that was where Mark first developed an interest in wine. In 1988 his College neighbour was Nathan Bailey (1987), who is now the winemaker at Brown Hill Estate in Margaret River. Brown Hill Estate is Mark's favourite winery and, unsurprisingly, their wines are the top three of Mark's list of top ten wines. 48 49 WINTER 2022The Little DragonNews & VisitorsLionel Ward (1953) and John Browne (1956) were quick to book their flights to Perth once the WA borders opened in March. A lunch was held at the College with some of their College friends followed by a tour of the Rodgers Wing. Susie Hester (1988) was another visitor to WA - Boyup Brook specifically - once the borders opened, but she was briefly spotted in Nedlands having dinner before heading to the airport. Also spotted at the restaurant was Megan McCracken (Egerton-Warburton 1985), who was celebrating her Industry Advocacy Award in the 2021 Women in Industry Awards, for her work with NAWO (National Association of Women in Operations).Spotted at the Government House Ballroom for the closing night of WA Opera's \"The Duel\" (in association with UWA Conservatorium of Music) were former College Warden Peter Simpson and new College Board member Mark Coughlan. Also enjoying the evening with Peter were Albert Tan (1967), Libby Day (1976), Deborah Porteous and John Day (1974). In May Peter celebrated his 85th birthday with Albert and Libby at Matilda Bay Restaurant. Tao Mantaras (2008) and Ana Robert Martinez (2012) first met at St George's College when Ana was on her exchange year at UWA. The two became friends, but Ana soon returned to London to finish her undergraduate studies. Almost five years later, Tao moved to London to begin his entrepreneurial journey and their paths reconnected. In 2020, as Ana was nearing her sixth year in Investment Banking and Private Equity and Tao was leaving the company he moved to London to co-found, they decided to apply to US business schools and were both admitted into Harvard Business School. They've been extremely grateful to be able to share the experience with each other and are happy to have made it through the first 'whirlwind' year. Always up for a new challenge, the two have seemingly traded places, with Ana now pursuing her own startup and Tao exploring the finance and investing world. L-R Rory Argyle (1956), Barrie Purser (1953), John Browne (1956), John Rodgers (1956), Lew Ward (1953), Ian HardyL-R Lew Ward (1953), Barrie Purser (1953), John Browne (1956) L-R Kate Lefebvre, Megan McCracken (Egerton-Warburton 1985), Susie Hester (1988) 48 49 WINTER 2022The Little DragonNews & VisitorsCongratulations to Kate Milligan (2016) who has been awarded UWA's prestigious Schenberg Music Fellowship for 2022. The Fellowship allows emerging artists to further their studies in composition, either interstate or overseas. Later this year Kate will commence a Master of Arts, Information Experience Design at the Royal College of Art, London. This interdisciplinary design course has a heavy focus on collaboration and Kate hopes to improve upon her digital audio literacy, her skillset in graphic/animated scoring and sound installation. Kate is a composer, conductor, and researcher. Her works are experimental and evocative, drawing on influences from many disciplines. Kate's most recent work, Lux Levis, was commissioned by the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) for violinist Josef Hanna. She has also written for the Summers Night Project, Perth Orchestra Project, Decibel New Music Ensemble, and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (Young and Emerging Composition Project). Kate regularly conducts the Perth Symphony Orchestra (PSO), having been appointed as their inaugural Conducting Fellow in 2020/21, and is completing a Master of Music at UWA. Her research practice incorporates sociology and musicology, with particular emphasis on constructions of gender in the sphere of new music and on the orchestral podium. Kate has also received funding from the 2022 APRA AMCOS Art Music Fund to create a new work for Renaissance flute and electronics. The work will be performed in 2023 by early music specialist Jonty Coy (2018) on a unique replica of a 16th-century flute recently discovered by archaeologists on a Dutch shipwreck. Jonty is currently studying a Masters in Early Music in the Netherlands. More information about this fascinating project can be found in Seesaw Magazine: https:// www.seesawmag.com.au/2022/05/ composer-looks-back-to-the-pastCongratulations to Kitty Drok (1988) and Valentine Yau (1988) who competed in Archery with great success at the recent Australian Masters Games in Perth. Over four days of competition, Kitty won silver medals in her age division with the longbow in both the Long Target and Short Target events and took out the gold medal in both the Clout and Field competitions. Val won gold medals in his age division shooting in the fiercely contested recurve category in both the Long Target and Short Target events. Kitty discovered archery as a teenager and shot for two years before abandoning it when her family moved to an area with no archery range or club nearby. Then, five years ago, she tried it again at the archery tourist park down at Vasse while on holidays and she remembered how much she loved it. Kitty and her son did a beginners' course and then joined a club, Bowmen of Melville, where she has been shooting ever since. She shoots both recurve (Olympic style) and longbow. She is the current state record holder (female longbow) for both the single and double clout events (shooting over 125m at a target laid out on the ground). Val took up archery about six years ago with his eldest son and is a member of the Baldivis Archery Club. He is one of the top-ranked male recurve shooters in the state for outdoor and indoor target archery. He is focused on recurve target archery at this stage, but Kitty has been encouraging him to try other styles to broaden his horizons. And, just quietly, the Bowmen of Melville club shirts look suspiciously like Georgian shirts with a knight and dragon on them. 50 51 WINTER 2022The Little DragonNews & VisitorsCongratulations to Michael Berry SC (1989) who has been appointed as a Judge of the Family Court of Western Australia (FCWA). Michael has been an accredited family law specialist for more than 20 years. He was admitted as a lawyer in December 1996 and joined the independent bar in 2005. As a barrister he has predominantly practised family law and was appointed a Senior Counsel in 2014. He also taught family law at UWA for several years and was President of the Family Law Practitioners Association for two years.Congratulations to Karys McEwen (2008) who recently published her debut novel \"All the Little Tricky Things\". Karys' book is aimed at readers aged 8-14 and tells the story of Bertie who lives in a small country town and is heading to high school in the city. It is partly based on Karys' own experience of growing up in Harvey and travelling each day to Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School. Nowadays, Karys is the Library Manager at Prahran High School in Melbourne and President of the Children's Book Council of Australia (Victoria Branch). She is passionate about the role libraries and literature play in the wellbeing of young people. \"All the Little Tricky Things\" is published by Text Publishing and is available in all good bookshops and online. To hear Karys talk about her book follow this link: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=zwrMJRypWk8 Congratulations to Lauren Masi (2014) and Alex Baird (2014) who were finally able to celebrate their engagement at a party in June after two previous celebrations had had to be cancelled due to COVID outbreaks. Hamish Cameron (1988), Tom Darbyshire (1987) and Simon Rea (1987) visited the College in May when Hamish was in WA from Sydney at the same time as Simon was here from Maryland, USA. For Hamish it was his first time back at the College since he left in 1989. Simon made the claim that he was the most ponded College resident ever so he was pleased that his title would not be challenged as ponding has not happened for over 20 years.Vaughan Wittorff (1990) made his first trip back to WA since he and his wife were married here in 2019. Vaughan enjoyed his trip down memory lane while visiting the College, seeing all the things that had changed since his time here. 50 51 WINTER 2022The Little DragonNews & VisitorsInterested in getting in touch with long-lost Georgian friends or organising a Georgian get-together?
