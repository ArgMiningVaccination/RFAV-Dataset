Following the purification of truncated resist protein and PIA, for the first time, PIA were conjugated to recess as a safe carrier to increase the immunogenicity of PIA and we evaluated it efficacy in mice. Construction of the conjugate was analyzed by using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (H1- NMR) methods. Afterwards, the immune response was evaluated by measuring total IgG, IgG2a, and IgG2b titers. Immunization of mice with the PIA-rSesC conjugate raised the levels of opsonic antibodies, and the vaccinated mice were protected.when challenged intravenously by wild type S. epidermidis strain 1457. Further studies indicated that the conjugated vaccine could eliminate S. epidermidis biofilm formation in in vitro and in vivo assays. This survey confirms the proposal that immunization of mice with PIA-rises conjugate vaccine could be secure and protected against Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.
