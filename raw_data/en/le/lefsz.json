In simpler words, a vaccination is the injection of a killed or weakened organism that produces immunity in the body against that organism. The immune system is the body 's defense against Many infectious diseases that once quickly spread and easily killed have been controlled or eradicated due to vaccinations. The efficacy of vaccines in reducing morbidity and mortality, particularly in children, is undeniable. Per the World Health Organization, childhood vaccinations prevent approximately 2-3 million deaths per year worldwide (WHO, 2016). In the United States, the value of immunizations is clearly displayed by comparing pre-vaccine era morbidity/mortality rates to post-vaccine era in regards to vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, prior to the diphtheria vaccine in the 1920's, 206,000 people annually contracted the disease resulting in 15,520 deaths (History of Vaccines, 2009). However, between 2004 and 2014, only In today's society we use many vaccines that help prevent many different diseases. Some of these are live, attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, toxoid vaccines, conjugate vaccines, DNA vaccines, recombinant vector vaccines. There are also multiple benefits of children getting there vaccinations early. There are also some downsides to Vaccines have been used to prevent diseases for centuries, and have saved countless lives of children and adults. The smallpox vaccine was invented as early as 1796, and since then the use of vaccines has continued to protect us from countless life threatening diseases such as polio, measles, and pertussis. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2010) assures that vaccines are extensively tested by scientist to make sure they are effective and safe, and must receive the approval of the Food and Drug Administration before being used. \"Perhaps the greatest success story in public health is the reduction of infectious diseases due to the use of vaccines\" (CDC, 2010). Routine immunization has eliminated smallpox from the globe and Database The databases used for this paper included CINAHL and PUBMED. The first search on CINAHAL, using the search string \"education + vaccines + children\" the results were too broad and resulted in 522 full-text hits. The final search used \"educational intervention + improve vaccines\" resulted in There is no doubt that the number of vaccines recommended by health care professionals and government agencies has increased rapidly since 1980. Furthermore, vaccines have also changed in how they are made, which is unknown or poorly understood by the general public. While reviewing the literature, this was shown in the article, \"Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses\", by Gerber & Offit (2009), where they discuss how vaccines have changed overtime. The authors state that today a single vaccine use uses less than 200 bacterial and viral proteins or polysaccharides compared to over 3000 immunological components used in 1980. In addition, the amount of protein chemistry and recombinant DNA has also increased. This helps cut back on vaccine-related reactions, because the vaccine only resembles a microbe and doesn't function on one. A vaccine is, by definition, \"a preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease\" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). In other words, living or killed viruses or bacteria are injected into the body and used to create antibodies for diseases caused by those viruses or bacteria. For example, the disease leptospirosis is caused by coming into contact with Leptospira bacteria through ingestion, being bitten by an infected animal, or having an open wound or mucous membrane that can allow the bacteria to enter the body. It is also a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans can contract it from their dogs, although this is uncommon (AVMA, n.d.). However, getting a yearly leptospirosis vaccine can help protect dogs from getting infected by the bacteria Due to the advances in medical science, individuals can be protected against more diseases than ever before. Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands of children have been eliminated completely due to safe and effective vaccines (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Individuals who do not receive vaccination pose dangers to those who are unable to receive vaccines due to medical conditions, there are no links that vaccine causes Autism, and vaccines cost less money than the financial burden of choosing not to receive a vaccine. Therefore, vaccines are the most effective way of protecting ourselves from vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccinations: A Practice of Public Safety Vaccinations: A Practice of Public Safety Since their first introduction in the late 1700s, vaccinations have been a controversial topic of discussion. Vaccines are a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of disease. Although we can attribute the eradication and control of many diseases to vaccinations, there are still many Americans who are refusing to vaccinate their children based on their belief in a few unfounded fears. Most of these fears that the anti vaccine community believes are centered around the health risks involved with the practice of vaccinating. The majority of these fears have been disproven through extensive research. With the continued research and innovations of the Everywhere in the world there's some mothers enforcing their right to not vaccinate their children. At the same time there are even more mothers enforcing the protection of their children. Those who choose not to vaccinate put themselves and others around them in danger. Women everywhere choose not to vaccinate Vaccines are one of the most unknown topics for people. They inject their body with chemicals without regard to what is going into their body and how it is affecting it. I, also, am guilty of doing this. To remove my ignorance and inform others, I am going to research more on this topic. By writing this paper, I am hoping to shed more light on this unfamiliar concept. Conjugate vaccinations were discovered in the 1980s as a solution to overcome the difficulties with polysaccharide vaccinations. Through using conjugation, the immune response could be changed from T-cell independent to T-cell dependent, meaning that the T-cells play a much bigger role in the immune response. This lead to an increased immunogenicity in infants and antibody booster response to multiple doses of the vaccine, two areas with which polysaccharide vaccinations fell short. Current conjugate vaccinations are available for pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases. Vaccine antigens may also be produced through genetic engineering and are termed recombinant vaccines. There are currently four types of recombinant vaccines. These include Hepatitis B, where the viral gene is inserted into a yeast cell, Human papillomavirus, where the genes for a viral coat protein are inserted into yeast cells, Typhoid, where the salmonella typhi bacteria are genetically modified to not cause illness, and influenza, where the virus has been engineered to replicate effectively in the mucosa of the nasopharynx rather than the Kaylee Davidson English 101 Dr. Smith 14 February 2016 Should You Vaccinate Your Child? The Center for Disease Control describes vaccines as the greatest development in public health since clean drinking water. For several decades, vaccines have saved countless lives and helped eradicate some fatal diseases. The push to do away with vaccines will not only endanger our youth, but our society as a whole. Vaccination is needed to maintain a healthy balance within our country. Vaccines provide the immunity that comes from a natural infection without the consequences of a natural infection. Vaccinations save an ever-growing amount of lives every year. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that 732,000 American children were saved from death and 322 million cases of childhood illnesses were prevented between 1994 and 2014 due to vaccination (\"Vaccine ProCon\"). The Global Vaccine Action Plan has two great ambitions. First, to deliver vaccination to everybody. This is because, about 1.5 million children still die every year of diseases that can be prevented by the vaccines that humankind has developed. Secondly, to unleash vaccines' vast future potential -because their impressive history is just the foundation stone of greater achievements to come. With these two great ambitions, the Global Vaccine Action Plan aims to make 2011-2020 the 'Decade of Vaccines' ( WHO, 2014). 2. Immunizations are very important in order to prevent the spread of certain communicable diseases. A vaccine is a \"suspension of infectious agents, components of the agents or genetically engineered antigens\" (Tamparo & Lewis, 88), which help to create a resistance to a particular infectious disease and helps to stop the spread of diseases in a community.
