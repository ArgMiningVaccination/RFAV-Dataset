Acupuncture Services FAQs: Q: What should I expect at my first visit? A: At your first visit, the main goal is to complete a thorough evaluation of your medical history and current symptoms in order to formulate a care plan. Here at Family Practice Center, that will include a full review of your medical concern, any prior treatments you have tried, and the ordering of any indicated blood testing or medical imaging. Usually, we will also perform a gentle first acupuncture treatment as well to familiarize you with the process and jumpstart the body's healing mechanisms. Q: What can I expect during treatments? A: Each acupuncture treatment is tailored to the individual, but most sessions will involve a brief check-in on your symptoms followed by the placement of 1-3 separate sets of needles. Depending on your symptoms, this is typically followed by some form of manual therapy which can include massage, cupping, fascial release, or other hands-on treatments from your doctor. Q: Are acupuncture treatments painful or dangerous? A: The needles used during acupuncture treatments are extremely thin and are inserted with a specialized technique. It's normal to experience some discomfort in certain areas during the treatment, but this is typically short lived and the treatments themselves should not be painful. In most, the treatments will be relaxing and patients have been known to fall asleep during even the most intense of acupuncture sessions! All needles used during acupuncture in our office are sterilized to ensure patient safety and the individual risks and potential benefits are discussed prior to every treatment Q: How often can I undergo acupuncture treatments? A: Each treatment plan is highly individualized. In most cases, once-weekly treatments for 4-6 weeks will help determine the effectiveness of the treatment and provide appropriate, prompt relief of symptoms. Many people can begin to space out their treatments as they improve, often coming back for maintenance sessions a few times per year. "}
