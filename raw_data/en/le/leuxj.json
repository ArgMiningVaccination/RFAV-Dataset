Abstract: Some individuals experience dizziness, syncope (temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure), seizure, and similar rare adverse events after vaccination. Sudden impacts to alertness, consciousness, ability to talk, vision, o r balance may pose rare risks for some vaccinees for a few days post vaccination. Herein, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) database is examined for relevant adverse events. These adverse events exhibit a consistent pattern of onset soon after vaccination consistent w ith other reported reactogenicity adverse events. The onset of t hese adverse events soon after va ccination provides supportive evidence to reject the hypothesis that the majority of these ad verse events represent background occurrences unrelated to vaccination. The immediate onset timin g of these adverse events represent a pattern that warrants further study. The observed onset patte rn for multiple unrelated vaccines are consistent with the possible e tiology of innate immune response s to vaccination as causative for these observed adverse events.

Introduction Multiple vaccines have been asso ciated with rare undesirable ra r e a d v e r s e e v e n t s . R e c e n t development of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and adenoviral vaccines for Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with higher frequencies of adverse events than seen previously for all other vaccines comb ined [1]. A small subset of these adverse events affecting alertness, balance, vision, and consci ousness have the potential for accidental injuries when they occur without warning. The etiolo gy for these increas ed frequencies of adverse events associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and other vaccines remain unknown. Some vaccinees (vaccinated individuals) experience vasovagal re action (VVR) shortly after vaccination. VVR can lead to dizziness, presyncope (near fainti ng), syncope (fainting/loss of consciousness) . Immunization stress-response (ISRR) has been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to include VVR. VVRs are report ed to be more common in adolescents and young adults [2]. Syncope was the most common a dverse event for 209215 vaccinees aged 6 through 17 [3]. Syncope was also the most comm on immediate adverse event reported by an Australian retrospective study [4]. Some cases o f COVID-19 vaccine-associated syncope can occur after the typical 10-15 minutes waiting perio d [5,6]. A study in Saudi Arabia reports adverse events per 10000 COVID-19 vaccine doses for diz ziness (17.8), headache (9.7), nausea (7.1), and syncope (3.2) [7]. A case study of 20 million M a l a y s i a n r e p o r t s a s m a l l increase risk of venous thromboembolism, arrhythmia, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are re ported to occur as exceedingly rare events with 2.73 per milli on for mRNA-1273 (M oderna) and 1 .02 per million for BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) [9]. A retrospective study of 418 people with epilepsy reported a 6.2% increase in seizure frequency the month following vaccination [10]. Also , inclusion of varicella to the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine increases the risk of febrile seizure [11]; perhaps through increased reactogenicit y due to combining these four va ccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) is the estab lished database set up to monitor adverse events following vaccination in the United Stat es. Herein, adverse events relevant to alertness, balance, vision, consciousness, falling, and head injury were characterized from V AERS reports from 1990 until Oct 21, 2022 for all vaccines wit h a focus on the vaccines with the highest reactogenicity levels. T he majority of these adverse ev ents occur within the first few days following vaccination, with the highest frequency within 24 hou rs of vaccination. This immediate onset timing pattern warrants additional studies. Individual va ccine subcomponents, including adjuvants, likely contribute to the reactogenicity level observ ed for each vaccine. Consistency of adverse event timing patterns and normalized frequency patterns of adverse events across unrelated vaccines support the hypothesis that reported reactogenicity ad verse events are associated with and correlate with the level of i nnate immune responses to vaccinat ion. The V AERS database is a resource for researchers to detect patt erns that warrant further study. V AERS is known to report and st ore co-occurring health events w ith no proof of causation. Mechanical incidents (e.g., car accident) may have no causality relationship with recent vaccination. An indirect relationship occurs when the mechanical operator ex periences a vaccine associated adverse events negatively imp acting consciousness or vision. Im mediate onset patterns for rare adverse events affecting consciousness, ability to talk, vertig o, dizziness, vertigo, etc. are observed 166 AIMS Allergy and Immunology V o l u m e 7 , I s s u e 2 , 1 6 4 - 1 7 5 . for vaccines with high reactogeni city levels. The inclusion of cautionary warnings may be warranted for driving, operating mechanical equipment, risk of falling, e tc. for 24 to 48 hours post vaccination for high reactogenicity level vaccines. Syncope and consciousne ss adverse events are also known to be associated with elevate d histamine levels [12,13]. The observed immediate onset pa tterns of loss of consciousness/ syncope and seizure all warrant additional study. Inclus ion of cautionary warnings may be warranted. The immediate onset pattern possibly implicates elevated histamine levels and possi bly additional molecules released by innate immune responses to vaccination. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. VAERS data mining The V AERS database was data mined for data on the following rep orted adverse events: Altered state of consciousness, aphasia (loss of ability to und erstand or express speech), confusional state, depressed level of consci ousness, dizziness, fall, head injury, hypotension, loss of consciousness, muscle twitching, pallor, presyncope, seizure, s omnolence, syncope, tremor, unresponsive to stimuli, vertigo, vision blurred, and visual im pairment; dizziness, pallor, vision blurred, and muscle twitching may precede syncope onset. The do wnloaded data include all adverse events reported from 1990 to Oct 21, 2022. The Ruby program, na med vaers_slice.rb [1], was used to tally selected reported vaccine adverse events by vaccine an d day of onset. The vaers_slice.rb program takes as input a list of one or more adverse events to characterize; these adverse events are summarized from the yearly V AERS Symptoms, Vax, and Data files from 1990 to 2022. The output from vaers_slice.rb consists of five reports: summaries by vacc ine, summaries by age of onset of symptoms, summaries by day of ons et of symptoms, and two summar ies of additional symptoms reported (selected symptoms and all other symptoms). Microsoft Excel was used create figures. 3.

Discussion All of the V AERS adverse events from 1990 to Oct 21, 2022 are s ummarized in the Supplemental data for combined ad verse events (Table S1) and 20 individual adverse events (Tables S2-S21). 4.1. Vasovagal reaction (VVR) Some vaccinees experience VVR adverse events immediately post v accination, typically within 15 minutes of vaccination. The highest frequency of examined ad verse events (Figures 1 and 2) are highest within 24 hours with risks decreasing rapidly for the s ubsequent days. VVR adverse events are most common for adolescents and young adults [2]. For the e xamined COVID-19 post-vaccination adverse events, this risk appears to decay in an approximate linear relationship from ages 20 to 100 (Figures 3 and 4). While a subset of the post-va ccination adverse events may be caused by VVR, the time of onset and an age of vaccinees affect ed suggest that the majority of these adverse events are not caused by VVR. 4.2. Immediate onset of adverse events Immediate onset adverse events are observed for multiple high r eactogenicity vaccines [1]. The highest levels of examined advers e events in V AERS are reported f o r t h e t w o C O V I D - 1 9 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and the COVID-19 ad enovirus vaccine (Janssen) (Figures 1 and 2 and Supplemental data Tables S1-S21). The obse rved immediate onset pattern of these adverse events is also observed for some non-COVID-19 vac cines. Expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA in innate immune cells is a possible caus e of the observed higher reactogenicity level of COVID-19 vaccines (Figures 1 and 2 and Supplemental data Tables S1-S21). The consistent onset pattern observed across unrelated vaccines (Figures 1 and 2 and Supplemental data Tables S1-S21) suggests that innate immune responses are t he principal driver of the majority of these adverse events experienced by vaccinees. Innate immune re sponses release inflammatory molecules, including histamine, as part of the innate immune re sponses to vaccinations. Many of the post-vaccination symptoms overlap with those of mast cell activ ation (MCA) [14]. The observation of consistent onset data pattern s across unrelated vaccines ena bles the exclusion of individual vaccine and adjuvant components (which drive reactogenicity lev el) with implication of immune responses to vaccinations. The immediate onset patterns of all of the examined adverse events also enables the exclusion of other possible etiology models (e.g., antibody responses can be excluded, etc.). The co-occurrences of these pairs of adverse events (Tab le 1) is suggestive of shared or overlapping etiology. 4.3. Gender bias The number of adverse event reports for some adverse events is generally higher for females, but can vary by vaccine type (mRNA versus adenoviral) (Table 2) . Pearson correlations, r, of the gender ratios (female/male) are 0.95 for COMIRNATY versus SPIKE V AD26.COV2.S, 0.71 for SPIKEV AX versus AD26.COV2.S. T he mRNA vaccines are 173 AIMS Allergy and Immunology V olume 7, Issue 2, 164-175. taken up by neutrophils and m onocytes with modified monocytes m igrating to lymph nodes. AD26.COV2.S infects muscle cells. These differences in gender r atios may be influenced the different vaccine type mechanisms for activating immune respons es. The differences in gender bias ratios (female/male) (Table 2) may indicate more than one etiol ogy for these adverse events. 4.4. Granulocytes and mast cell mediators Innate immune responses include activation of granulocytes and mast cells to release inflammatory molecules including histamine. The amount of infla mmatory molecules released is predicted to correlate with the reactogenicity level of the vac cine. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are synthesized following degranulat ion and promote increased permeability of vasodilation, and inflammator leukotrienes appear have higher potency than with their vascular effects (reviewed [15]). Histamine and platelet activatin g factor (PAF) can activate nit ric oxide production resulting in dilation of blood vessels and dys function of the endothelial ba rrier (reviewed [15]). Histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes, PAF, and additional inflammatory molecu les are candidate drivers of the examined adverse events (Figures 1 and 2). The majority of reactogenicity adverse events following vaccina tions are predicted to be caused by elevated histamine levels [1] including menstrual adverse ev ents [16], [17]. The histamine tole rance level can vary by individual for multiple including drugs [18], foods [13,18], gastroint estinal [13], and pregnancy; histamine intolerance may be associated with the rarity of the adverse events affecting consciousness level, etc. 4.5. Loss of consciousness/syncope and seizure injury risks The rare adverse events of loss of consciousness/syncope and se izure have rapid onset (Figure 1) with little or no advance warning; when they occur while drivin g a vehicle, operating heavy equipment, or in elevated locations, the risks for an accident or falling is significantly increased. Seizure can be associated with a syncopal episode. Figure 1 ill ustrates loss of consciousness, syncope, and seizure adverse events immediately post vaccinations with t he greatest risk within the first 24 and 48 hours. These immediate onset patterns provide support fo r the addition of safety warnings to current high reactogenicity treatments, including COVID-19 mRNA and adenovirus vaccines. Vaccinees exercising caution and avoiding higher risk activitie s for a day or two will likely reduce falls, head injuries, and other rare accidents. Elevated histamine has a potential role for a subset of the eva luated adverse events including hypotension, loss of consciousness, presyncope, syncope, etc. H owever, seizures may have a different etiology. Low levels of histamine are associated with convulsions and seizures [19]. It is suggested that H1 antagonists should not be administered to pat ients with febrile seizures to avoid disturbing the anticonvulsive centr al histaminergic system [20, 21]. 174 AIMS Allergy and Immunology V olume 7, Issue 2, 164-175. 5. Conclusions Vaccinations provide protection against potential pathogen infe ctions. Rare adverse events impacting consciousness and risk of falling occur with immediat e onset patterns. The majority of these adverse events are reporte d within the 48 hours of vaccin ation. Avoidance of activities like driving, operating heavy machinery, with increased risks of fal ling, etc. for 1 to 2 days post vaccination provide an opportunity to reduce the frequencies of falls, head injuries, and other rare accidents.
