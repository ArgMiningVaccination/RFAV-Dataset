When he figured out that the dreams he was chasing early in his career weren't always his, he decided to do the work to really figure out what he wanted for his life. In stepping into a career of service as a coach and business consultant, he found his route to success. His business, Sweeney Coaching Group, was born. \"I help entrepreneurs, leaders and high performers define and achieve success in their businesses, in their teams and in their lives,\" said Sweeney. \"I typically work with clients in a one-on-one coaching partnership. I also spend time speaking and working with groups in half-day or full-day workshops, much like I did with LIBA's board over this past year.\" What Sweeney does is offer his clients a way to see their businesses, and their lives, in a different way. He partners with them to create powerful solutions to challenges rather than quick fixes. Together, they focus on achieving goals that have felt just out of reach, becoming more accountable and more successful along the way. Sweeney's goal is to help people define what it is they really want and then to figure out how to get it. \"I've been mentoring and coaching informally for two decades. 2020 felt like the right time to finally start listening to all of the people that said you should do this for a living,\" said Sweeney. \"And, I transitioned. I've been growing and building businesses my entire career. Coaching combines my passion for business growth with my passion for people in a dynamic way.\" Not only has he made his way as an impactful coach, he's started multiple other businesses and raised millions of dollars for a charity he and his wife helped launch to benefit their son who suffers from cystic fibrosis. Sweeney stays busy as he's committed himself to living a life of service. He says, \"I don't look for clients. I look for opportunities to serve and problems to solve.\" As a coach, he looks forward to continuing his mission of powerfully serving and seeing more and more of his clients build the businesses and the lives of their dreams. www.derylsweeney.com deryl@derylsweeney.com 502-435-2043 Helping high performers win in all things business, life & leadership 3LIBA BUSINESS MEMBER INDEX 2023 ....................................................................... 36 21 Skye Design ................................................. 63 211 Excelsior ..................................................... 76 301 Interactive Marketing .......................... 85 3rd Turn Brewing ............................................ 15 The 40 & 1 Company ..................................... 58 502 Cafe ............................................................... 19 502 Hemp Wellness Center ....................... 40 502 Power Yoga ............................................... 85 502 PRINT and COPY .................................... 74 502ads .................................................................. 50 5-0-Louvenirs .................................................... 38 520 East Brands ............................................... 58 609 West Main Partners .............................. 76 The 7 Leaf CBD and Hemp Market ........41 A Plus Paper Shredding ............................... 83 A Taste of Kentucky ....................................... 38 A.

In 2016, new owners, Mike and Medora Safai converted it into a coffee roasting facility. While contemplating renting unused space as storage, the Safai's came upon a different option. \"We had just left Cincinnati's Findlay Market,\" says Mike Safai. Discussing the lack of a similar option in Louisville, \"the conversation developed as each mile went by from 'wouldn't that be cool' to a full fledged business concept.\" \"Mike's family is from Seattle, and when we visit there we always go to Pike's Market,\" Medora says. The planning for Logan Street was inspired by other public markets in larger cities like Pike's, Quincy Market in Boston, Reading Market in Philadelphia, and Chelsea Market in New York City. The market, located at 1001 Logan Street, covers 30,000 square feet of interior space, plus a side street outdoor market on weekends. Thirty-five booths make up the permanent year-round market, with an additional 10-15 pop-up booths on weekends. T wo years ago, the market was created as an entrepreneurial incubator, each vendor chosen specifically to fill a niche. It fulfills the needs of local residents in the city's food desert neighborhoods while providing out-of-towners a fun place to explore Louisville's creative side.This past year, Wild Hops Brewery began in-house brewing, with 5 brews on tap and the newly revealed Wild Hops Venue -- an 8,000-square- foot space with a stage, soft seating and optimal social distancing options, with events occurring throughout the week. Dine-in prepared foods inspired by Latin, Asian and French fusion cuisine are a big draw to the market with artisan retail vendors rounding out guests' visits. The businesses are independently and locally owned, often by minorities and women. They showcase a mixture from apparel and arts to take-home staples like groceries, pet supplies, meats, cheese, coffee, packaged wine, spirits, beer and newly added fresh on-site baked bread. The market runs Tuesday through Sunday and is closed on Mondays. Breakfast starts at 8 a.m. daily Shopping is from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Sundays at 6pm) Wild Hops Brewery serves until 9 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday, 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 6 p.m. Sunday There will be special extended hours through the holidays when vendors will stay open until 8 p.m. For updates on offerings and hours, please check their facebook and instagram pages @ loganstreetmarket or visit loganstmarket.com Logan Street Market is hosting The Flea Off Market November 26th and each Saturday and Sunday through December 19th.
