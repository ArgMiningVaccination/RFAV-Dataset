Normally, when [bacteria](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [viruses](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) enter the body, some of the [B cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) will change into plasma cells. The plasma cells make [antibodies](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight bacteria and viruses, to stop [infection](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and disease. Plasma cell [neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46264&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are diseases in which [abnormal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plasma cells form [tumors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the bones or soft [tissues](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the body. The plasma cells also make an antibody [protein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), called [M protein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), that is not needed by the body and does not help fight infection. These antibody proteins build up in the bone marrow and can cause the [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to thicken or can damage the [kidneys](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411379&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MGUS) is not cancer but can become [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The following types of plasma cell neoplasms are cancer: Plasma cell neoplasms include the following: In this type of [plasma cell](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [neoplasm](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46264&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), less than 10% of the [bone marrow](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is made up of abnormal [plasma cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and there is no [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The abnormal plasma cells make [M protein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is sometimes found during a routine [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [urine test](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In most patients, the amount of M protein stays the same and there are no [signs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [symptoms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or health problems. In some patients, [MGUS](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may later become a more serious [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [amyloidosis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45507&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or cause problems with the kidneys, heart, or [nerves](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). MGUS can also become cancer, plasma cells ( [myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45795&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are in one place and form one [tumor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), called a [plasmacytoma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46231&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes plasmacytoma can be [cured](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There are two types of plasmacytoma. Signs and [symptoms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depend on where the marrow](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and form [tumors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in many bones of the body. These tumors may keep the bone marrow from making enough healthy [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells. Normally, the bone marrow makes [stem cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature cells) that become three types of mature blood cells: As the number of myeloma cells increases, fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are made. The myeloma cells also damage and weaken the bone. Sometimes multiple myeloma does not cause any [signs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [symptoms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is called [smoldering multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=413932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It may be found when a [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [urine](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) test is done for another [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Signs and symptoms may be caused by multiple myeloma or other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: A tumor can damage the bone and cause [hypercalcemia](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45363&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (too much [calcium](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the blood). This can affect many [organs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body, including the [kidneys](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [nerves](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269443&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), heart, muscles, and [digestive tract](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and cause serious health problems. Hypercalcemia may cause the following signs and symptoms: In rare cases, multiple myeloma can cause peripheral nerves (nerves that are not in the brain or spinal cord) and organs to fail. This may be caused by a condition called amyloidosis. Antibody proteins build up and stick together in peripheral nerves and organs, such as the kidney and heart. This can cause the nerves and organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they should. Amyloidosis may cause the following signs and symptoms: Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop plasma cell neoplasms, and they will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Plasma cell neoplasms are most common in people who are middle aged or older. For multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma, other risk factors include the following: Studies about how racial, social, and financial factors affect access to treatment and rates of plasma cell neoplasms are ongoing. In addition to asking about your [personal](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures: The [prognosis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on the following: Treatment options depend on the following: The process used to find out the amount of [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body is called [staging](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is important to know the [stage](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used to find out how much cancer is in the body: [Beta-2-microglobulin](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [albumin](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the a [protein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found on [plasma cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Albumin makes up the biggest part of the blood [plasma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It keeps [fluid](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from leaking out of [blood vessels](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It also brings [nutrients](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [tissues](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and carries [hormones](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vitamins](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and other substances, such as [calcium](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), all through the body. In the blood of patients with [multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45793&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the amount of beta-2-microglobulin is increased and the amount of albumin is decreased. In [stage I multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44859&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels are as follows: In [stage II multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44863&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels are in between the levels for stage I and stage III. In [stage III multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44866&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level of [beta-2-microglobulin](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is 5.5 mg/L or higher and the patient also has one of the following: Plasma cell [neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46264&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are called [refractory](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when the number of plasma cells keeps going up even though treatment is given. Plasma cell neoplasms are called [relapsed](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when they have come back after treatment. Different types of treatments are available for patients with [plasma cell](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46264&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. [Chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer [cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ( [systemic chemotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). See [Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/multiple-myeloma). [Corticosteroids](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [antitumor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects in [multiple myeloma](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45793&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Targeted therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Several types of targeted therapy may be used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms. There are different types of targeted therapy: See [Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/multiple-myeloma). High [doses](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including [blood](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cell transplant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. [Stem cells](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient ( [autologous](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44912&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) or a [donor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ( [allogeneic](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44920&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. [Immunotherapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of [biologic therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45617&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). See [Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/multiple-myeloma). Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. [Surgery](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the tumor may be done. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Watchful waiting](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45942&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely [monitoring](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) a patient's [condition](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment until [signs](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or symptoms appear or change. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). Clinical trials are studying different combinations of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, [steroid therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and drugs. New treatment [regimens](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) using [selinexor](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798670&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are also being studied. For information about [side effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, see our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) page. This therapy controls problems or [side effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life. [Supportive care](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms. Supportive care may include the following: For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from [recurring](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search) webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) website. Some of the tests that were done to [diagnose](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer or to find out the [stage](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about treatment of plasma cell neoplasms (including multiple myeloma). It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment). A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center) (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
