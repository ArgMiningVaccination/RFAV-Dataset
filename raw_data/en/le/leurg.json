Hence, steer clear of them to facilitate faster recovery from jaundice. Let us now look at the leading causes of jaundice in both adults and newborns. Causes And Risk Factors For Jaundice Jaundice occurs due to excess bilirubin in the body in both adults and infants. Bilirubin is a waste product that is produced as a result of the breakdown of your red blood cells. This compound is broken down and excreted through the stools. Prior to birth, babies have a different form of hemoglobin that starts to break down rapidly after they are born. This generates high levels of bilirubin that need to be excreted from their body. An underdeveloped liver cannot excrete bilirubin as fast as it is being produced, and hence, this might result in hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice in infants. Other causes and risk factors for jaundice in infants are: - Breastfeeding jaundice that occurs when the baby is not fed well in the first week of life. - Breast milk jaundice that occurs when certain compounds in breast milk interfere with the breakdown of bilirubin. - Medical conditions like sickle cell anemia, liver disease, and sepsis. - Premature birth - Bruising during birth - Blood group incompatibility between the mother and the infant. The causes and risk factors for jaundice or high bilirubin levels in adults are: - Medical conditions like malaria, sickle cell anemia, cirrhosisi [X]A severe form of liver disease when good liver tissue is permanently damaged and replaced by scar tissue. , cancer, gallstones, and autoimmune disorders. - Certain medications - Parasites like liver flukes - Exposure to different types of viral hepatitis - Hereditary conditions - Alcohol consumption The following are some of the signs and symptoms that surface with jaundice in adults and infants. What Are The Signs And Symptoms Of Jaundice? - Pale stool - Dark urine - Itchy skin - Vomiting - Nausea - Bleeding (in the rectum) - Diarrhea - Chills - Fever - Loss of appetite - Weakness - Weight loss - Abdominal pains and headaches - Swelling (legs and abdomen) The signs of jaundice in infants include: - Drowsiness - Poor feeding - Pale stools - Dark urine - Yellow abdomen and limbs - Weakness - Inability to put on weight - Irritability Jaundice may be divided into three major types, depending on its cause. Types Of Jaundice - Pre-Hepatic Jaundice: This type of jaundice results from an excessive breakdown of red blood cells, which overwhelms the liver's ability to metabolize bilirubin. - Hepatocellular Jaundice: When your liver loses its ability to metabolize bilirubin, it results in hepatocellular jaundice. This type is often a result of liver dysfunction. - Post-Hepatic Jaundice: When there is an obstruction in the drainage of bilirubin from your body, it results in post-hepatic jaundice. Let's now take a look at the levels of bilirubin in adults and infants that determine the onset of jaundice. Jaundice Level Chart The most common way of testing the bilirubin levels is through a blood test, though an amniotic fluid test and a urine test can also give reliable results. The test measures the levels of both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The normal bilirubin levels in adults range from 0.2 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL. Any levels above this are considered high, and the individual has an increased risk of developing jaundice. Newborns should not have bilirubin levels above 5 mg/dL. Infants whose bilirubin levels rise above this level after a few days of birth are also at the risk of developing jaundice. As per this [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544252/), jaundice is more commonly seen in newborns and the elderly. In newborns, around 20% may develop jaundice due to an immature liver function. Among children, hepatitis A is the primary cause of jaundice, whereas, in elders, it is either due to bile duct block or liver damage. High bilirubin levels are not favored, and they must be kept in check to avoid health complications that may lead to jaundice. Consult a doctor as soon as symptoms arise as jaundice can be a presentation of many severe diseases like hepatitis, liver failure, and certain hematological conditions. Jaundice may take an ugly turn if the treatment is delayed for too long. Hence, it is best to start treatment while also following these remedies. Infographic: 5 Home Remedies To Treat Jaundice Jaundice can be dangerous to one's health, and recovery can take weeks. Relying solely on medication during your illness may not be the best option.

Both adults and infants can get jaundice, albeit for different reasons. However, in either case, jaundice, if left untreated, can lead to severe complications as it generally is an indication of underlying health conditions. Some common signs of jaundice include yellowing of skin and eyes, pale stool, dark urine, weakness, and inability to gain weight or weight loss. While medical treatment is essential for this condition, you can apply some home remedies to cure jaundice, such as exposure to sunlight, natural foods like papaya, tomatoes, sugarcane juice, barley water, and the application of specific essential oils. Frequently Asked Questions How long does jaundice last in babies? Jaundice in babies, especially breast milk jaundice, may last anywhere from 3 to 12 weeks. Why are babies born with jaundice? Babies develop jaundice when the bilirubin levels in their bodies are more than the kidneys can flush out. High bilirubin could be a result of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells.
