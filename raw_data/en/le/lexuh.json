Our son was completely concussion symptomatic and Dr. Kaplan was extremely thorough with his evaluation, was quick to hydrate him and administer medication for nausea. He also referred us to the concussion clinic for follow-up. Our son felt so much better that he was able to eat on the way home - and that would be his only meal for the next 8 days. We value Dr. Kaplan's decisive evaluation, his appreciation of Stephen's symptoms, even the nausea, and his caring bedside manner. - Overview - Board Certification(s) - Pediatric Emergency Medicine Pediatrics - Medical/Professional School - University Of North Carolina School Of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC - Residency - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School, Chapel Hill, NC - Fellowship - Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA - Research Focus Area - Translational Research "}
