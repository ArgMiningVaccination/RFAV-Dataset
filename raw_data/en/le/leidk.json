Hoping to bring a little peace and tranquility to your inner self during these turbulent times. About Dr. Anjali Dsouza I am a board-certified physician specializing in Integrative Medicine, Palliative Care, and Psychiatry. My approach to healing prioritizes the whole person, rather than a specific system or organ, always honoring the importance of the relationship between you and me. I utilize evidence-based research to guide our clinical decisions, and draw on therapeutic interventions to maximize your overall well-being. In addition to my conventional medical training, I have spent the last ten years studying Integrative and Functional Medicine. I am passionate about helping people live in their most vital state. "}
