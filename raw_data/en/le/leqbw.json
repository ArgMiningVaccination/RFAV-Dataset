Abstract Objectives: In line with the growing interest in integrated health care approaches, both nonindigenous (e.g., Western) and indigenous people are participating in healing ceremonies. However, little is known about the potential health-related benefit of healing ceremonies. Thus, the current study sought to close this gap in the literature by exploring the effect of healing ceremonies on participant's self-rated quality of life. Design: Data were gathered at three time points (T1: 4 weeks before ceremony; T2: 2 days before ceremony; T3: 4 weeks after ceremony). Participants: 25 persons with various diseases participated in the healing ceremony. Interventions: A 6-hour healing ceremony was conducted. Outcome measures: Mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual quality of life were assessed. Results: Participation in a healing ceremony increased mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual quality of life. Conclusions: As part of integrative health care, healing ceremonies are potentially useful for fostering participants' quality of life.
