I decided to investigate further on how to help her. The consensus among autism researchers was that genetic and environmental factors were the main causes. Vaccines containing thimersol with mercury were also suspected because parents noticed symptoms around the time of vaccination. With thimersol removal the autism rate increased. Reliable statistics were not available. The CDC set up stations in 14 states to monitor incidence and found an 18% yearly increase. Use of the statistic of 8 year olds was found to be more reliable because by that time the diagnosis of autism has been established. However, dietary intake could not be established and a process called nutritional epidemiology was used. Results showed that the greater the percentage of breast feeding the higher the number of autism cases in the states and the counties of 4 of these states. The amounts of milk that babies drank were determined from the USDA and the amounts of B-vitamins consumed were calculated. Results showed that the minimal daily requirements were not met. Sugar was significantly related directly to the autism rate of eight year olds. In conclusion, it appears that autism may be related to inadequate intake of B-vitamins.
