He has MUCH better self control in regulating his reactions and emotions now, and his focus in school has improved amazingly - I get glowing reports weekly, now, for how he is improving. I couldn't be happier with it! The only downside that I've noticed thus far - and this might be particular to my child, mind you - is the body odor. I've noticed a drastic change in the 'scent' of his sweat overall, and its downright sour/rancid at times, TBH. He is at that age where there's an increase in sweat, too - and it did occur to me that the product might be helping his body to flush out some 'stored toxins' that were otherwise being held onto; so FYI for the other parents out there. We happen to use Lume deoderant, personally, and that helps immensely - but we will be getting their body soap very soon here, as well, just in case this effect is simply a normal byproduct from daily use of the supplement. It has only been a little less then 2 months, so, time will tell on that - and as a downside, its quite manageable. Thank you for this wonderful product! I am so glad we found this product. My teenage son has made a complete 360. He loves the calm and clarity he has throughout the day. I've tried a dozen or more medicines and supplements that are for sleep. Some have helped a bit. Neural Balance is helping a lot. It's been great! Neural Balance has helped my son establish a good foundation of focus and calm with his ADHD. He still takes a prescription medication, but has been able to keep the dose lower when combined with Neural Balance. I love this Neural Balance. My anxiety is gone and for the first time in my life I am living in the present. I have a severe insomnia problem and not sure this is helping. "}
