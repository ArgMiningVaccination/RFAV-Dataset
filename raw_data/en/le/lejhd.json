The data 4 used in this work is extensive and detailed and includes information on weekly 5 number of cases and vaccination rates by age and region. Our approach takes 6 into account waning immunity . The statistical analysis allows us to determine 7 the effects of choosing alternative vaccination strategies. Our results indicate 8 greater uptake of vaccine would have led to fewer cases with a particularly 9 large effect on undervaccinated regions while an alternative distribution scheme 10 ignoring age would affect the vulnerable population at the time (the elderly) 11 and is less ideal. 12 Keywords: Vaccination coverage, infectious disease surveillance, endemic-epidemic mod- 13 elling, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 14 15 1 Introduction 16 Each year vaccines (pre-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis interventions) save lives 17 by reducing preventable illness and death.

This has lead to outbreaks of vaccine- 20 preventable diseases that were previously eliminated in Europe, such as measles [1]. There 21 is a concern that newly developed vaccines in response to pandemics will not be accepted 22 by the population they seek to protect. 23 In December 2020, vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 24 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19) infections were authorised for use in 25 Switzerland. They were distributed in 2021 following an age-based distribution scheme 26 going from oldest to youngest. A booster (additional dose of vaccine after immunity is 27 achieved which is used to maintain immunity) was included in the immunisation schedule 28 for COVID-19 late in 2021 and continued during 2022 following the same age-based distri- 29 bution scheme. As those aged 65 years and older were first invited to be immunised, later 30 followed by 16 to 64 year olds, and finally 12 to 15 year olds, changes in the age profile of 31 cases (who is getting sick) have been observed. Additionally , in Switzerland, changes in 32 the spatial distribution of cases (where people are getting sick) have also been observed, 33 with a shift from urban centres to more rural, unvaccinated communities. 34 Vaccine hesitancy (defined as a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite avail- 35 ability) is found in Switzerland, where vaccination is not mandatory . This is a current issue 36 of mounting concern that needs to be solved. The World Health Organization named vac- 37 cine hesitancy as one of the ten threats to global health already in 2019, noting its detri- 38 mental effects on populations who are less protected against life-threatening diseases even 39 in non-pandemic settings. Vaccine hesitancy affects the uptake of vaccines and likely also 40 the adherence to other public health interventions in certain population groups. An un- 41 dervaccinated population has the potential to hamper disease control efforts for the entire 42 country . Others have noted that in the Swiss context \"vaccine hesitancy and underimmu- 43 nisation seem to be specific to certain population subgroups\" [2]. COVID-19 is currently 44 the only human coronavirus for which there is a vaccine available but hesitancy persists [3]. 45 Ongoing work seeks to understand the drivers of Swiss vaccine hesitancy [4]. 46 We study COVID-19 incidence data from 2021 (from 1st January 2021 to 30th Novem- 47 ber 2021, both dates included) to examine the effect of vaccines on the spread of disease 48 2 .

We analyse weekly cases in two separate analyses, one is stratified by age 49 group and one is stratified by region. This approach is motivated by cases being observed 50 among younger ages in this time period (compared with earlier), with cases also exhibiting 51 spatial heterogeneity in regions, as well as vaccination rates differing by unit (age group or 52 region). Switzerland provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of vaccination 53 heterogeneity due to its federalised nature. Regions are less harmonised than in other Eu- 54 ropean countries. We seek to determine the impact of the current vaccination strategy and 55 the effect of regions with low vaccine uptake. 56 Using epidemic data sources from infectious disease surveillance systems at weekly 57 resolution, we are able to capture the spread of disease across space and between age 58 groups through an endemic-epidemic modelling approach. The vaccination coverage is 59 time-dependent, age group-dependent, and region-dependent. Our approach builds upon 60 a unique incorporation of time-varying vaccination coverage in an endemic-epidemic model 61 with time-varying transmission weights. Time-varying transmission weights reflecting weekly 62 levels of situational measures (amount of disease control) is a novel inclusion in the model 63 since the advent of COVID-19, which has proven to be useful in examining policy questions 64 [5-7]. Outlined here is a wider application which also includes vaccination effects. We in- 65 vite interested readers to our study protocol [8] which contains even more detail. 66 Vaccination coverage has previously been included in endemic-epidemic modelling [9- 67 12] for routine immunisation without taking into account changes over time (assuming 68 stationarity). We include vaccination coverage in a similar manner in our models; to our 69 knowledge the first endemic-epidemic model for COVID-19 which includes time and unit- 70 specific vaccination rates. Calls for other vaccination distribution criteria than age to be 71 considered when introducing novel vaccines to immunisation schedules in pandemic set- 72 tings, such as socio-economic status [13], have been made. For this reason, we analyse 73 alternative scenarios (an approach which has successfully been utilised in the analysis of 74 non-pharmaceutical interventions to evaluate the impact of their timing [5-7]) to examine 75 other rollout strategy schemes and uptake options (increased coverage). 76 3 .

Data is publicly available from the 80 Swiss public health authority's COVID-19-specific website (BAG) www.covid19.admin.ch 81 and introduced in our study protocol [8]. Auxiliary data is provided by Mistry et al. [14] 82 (contacts), Hale et al. [15] (policy), and Data for Good1(mobility) and where merging of 83 data is necessary , the groupings and temporal resolution used in the data from BAG are 84 matched. The age bands provided are ten year age bands, however we have not included 85 the age group 09in this work as the focus is on the protective effect of vaccines and 86 they received none during the study period leading to a vaccination coverage which is con- 87 stantly zero, providing no information to the model. 88 2.1 Spatial dispersion 89 Spatial dispersion is included in the model to reflect how disease spreads. Switzerland 90 consists of 26 regions (Figure 2). The adjacencies between the 26 Swiss regions are given 91 in a matrix of neighbourhood order o= (orr)denoting the distance from one region rto 92 anotherr(Figure 2). In this calculation, we decided that Neuch\u00e2tel (NE) and Jura (JU) 93 as well as Schaffhausen (SH) and Thurgau (TG) do not share a border as when looking at 94 a regular map they did not share most of their border in common. 95 T o reflect additional changes in movement during the study period as a result of dis- 96 ease control policy implemented, we include mobility data mrt(Figure 1) measuring the 97 average change in mobility in region rin weekt. The data is provided as a change from 98 baseline (February 2020) which we normalise by transforming it byxmin( x) max( x)min( x)to ensure 99 that we do not have negative transmission weights in our model (as the change from base- 100 line is sometimes given as a negative value). Mobility data was not available for Appen- 101 zell Innerrhoden (AI) so we imputed them with values from the adjoining region Appenzell 102 1Use of this data is not an endorsement of Facebook/Meta 4 .

[5] such that we obtain time-varying adjacency matrices w (short form for adjacency pointt) with entries: wr,r,t=1 (or r+ 1)\u00b7mrt (1) (Figure 3). We see an increase in mobility during the middle of the study period (Figure 1). 104 This means we will expect to observe increased transmission opportunities in certain re- 105 gions during that time. 106 2.2 Contacts 107 Respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 are transmitted through contact between age groupaanda. We incorporate a contact matrix c= (caa)in the model to reflect the pattern of spread of the disease across age groups. The Swiss contact matrices from Mis- try et al. [14] (Figure 2) are used in this work and aggregated to the ten year age bands used in the case data. Contacts occur in four locations l(household, school, work, and other). The contact matrices are adjusted by the policy data like in Bekker-Nielsen Dunbar et al. [6, 7] such that we obtain time-varying contact matrices w for each week tacross all locationslwith entries given by: wa,a,t=mt\u00b7X lqlt\u00b7ca,a,l (2) where the proportionality factor qlt=ql\u00b7qtis informed by qlwhich is a weight for con- 108 tacts in location l(which is provided with the location-specific contact matrices) and qt 109 which denotes policy implemented in week t(Figure 3). Once we have calculated the to- 110 tal contacts using this factor, we additionally incorporate the average change in mobility 111 across regions in week t,mt(Figure 1) across all contacts because the policy indicators qt112 do not capture more nuanced changes in transmission opportunities such as those caused 113 by public holidays whereas the mobility data is expected to encapsulate such aspects. The 114 mobilitymrtis averaged over regions to obtain mt. Earlier policy data was more granular. 115 We divide the raw policy indicators by the maximum level it can take and then impose a 116 5 .

As in Bekker-Nielsen Dunbar et al. [6, 7] qt1in the 118 household setting. 119 2.3 Vaccines 120 The vaccination coverage is calculated based on the second (full immunity) and third doses (\"booster\") of the vaccine as xit=X stu(ts)\u0010 x(2) is+x(3) is\u0011 (3) wherex(d) is of dose d(d= 2,3) for unitiin weeks(doses 121 given at time sscaled by the population of unit i), weeksoccurs before week t, andu(.) 122 is the waning function (Figure 4). We apply the waning function u(.)to account for wan- 123 ing immunity in our vaccination coverage calculation (see the supporting information (file 124 sens) for a sensitivity analysis of u(.)). The unit ican either be age groups (a) or regions 125 (r). This approach allows us to determine the vaccination coverage in each week ttaking 126 into account that the COVID-19 vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity . For each unit 127 at each time point, the cumulative doses given are the sum of vaccines given in that week 128 as well as the waned vaccines given in previous weeks t. The vaccination coverage is shown 129 in Figure 5. 130 3 Methods 131 We fit four types of endemic-epidemic models using the open source software package 132 developed by Meyer et al. [17]. The endemic-epidemic model is a time series-based mod- 133 elling approach for infectious disease surveillance first formulated in Held et al. [18]. Since 134 its introduction it has been extended to include vaccination coverage [9], random inter- 135 cepts [19], seasonal effects [20], time-constant transmission weights between units relaxing 136 a homogenous mixing assumption [21, 22], prediction and forecasting [23], and most re- 137 time-varying transmission weights [5-7]. 138 6 .

The unit ican either be age groups (a) or re- 145 gions (r ).

We fit models to regional units rand age group units aseparately . 161 While ours is the first endemic-epidemic model for COVID-19 with time-varying vacci- 162 nation coverage at weekly granularity , previous models have been constructed for measles 163 with vaccination coverage [9-12] (T able 1). While other research groups [9-12] considered 164 a different disease (measles) and setting (non-pandemic), their estimated effects of vacci- 165 nation coverage are included in Figure 8 as a comparison with our work. We estimate the 166 effect of vaccination coverage for models with time constant transmission weights to allow 167 for such that we can liken the results for novel vaccines with routing scheduled immuni- 168 sation. We then focus on the results for models with time-varying transmission weights 169 w= (wiit)as a constant transmission weight matrix w= (wii)is not informative for a 170 situation with as many changes as expected in the setting considered; an emerging infec- 171 tious disease with the introduction of a pharmaceutical countermeasure. 172 3.2 Scenario prediction 173 We predict the number of expected COVID-19 cases under the alternative scenarios of 174 vaccination distribution hence coverage. Using the multivariate path forecasting method 175 from Held et al. [23, Appendix A] we predict the mean (first moment) incidence by unit 176 (age group or region). The single-step prediction approach is iteratively applied to obtain 177 multivariate multi-step predictions. We use the estimated model coeicients in the predic- 178 tion approach rather than refitting the model. 179 In one scenario we replace the observed vaccination coverage covariate (Figure 5) 180 log(1 xit)with an alternative option which for xrtis the maximum vaccination coverage 181 in any region r(Figure 6) and for xatis the number of vaccines given to each age group 182 aafter redistributing the total vaccines given at any time to be given to all age groups 183 by amounts proportional to the size of the age group (see the supporting information (file 184 supp) for the redistribution). This scenario projection allows us to determine the expected 185 impact of two alternative vaccination distribution schemes. 186 In line with recommendations by den Boon et al.

We provide here 191 an overview of results and refer the interested reader to the supporting information (files 192 models-age and models-regions) for full model results (there are results for in total 26 193 regions and eight age groups).

Our es- 194 timated effect for vaccination coverage in a model with time constant transmission weights 195 w= (wii)is in line with the results obtained by other research groups [9-12] (T able 2 and 196 Figure 8). We now focus on the results for time-varying transmission weights w= (wiit). 197 As some of the endemic effects had large confidence intervals when including just a 198 simple intercept (intercept that was not unit-specific (\u00b7)), we included effects of unit (age 199 group or region) ()in the endemic component. This is one of the strategies outlined 200 in Meyer et al. [26]. As we have a large number of units in our analysis of regions we de- 201 cided to include a random intercept rather than a fixed intercept for this analysis. How- 202 13 .

We 211 show the fitted values summed across units in Figure 7. while results for individual units 212 are found in the supporting information (files models-age and models-regions). The 213 models fit the data well and show similar patterns (Figure 7) with an increase in endemic 214 cases in the summer and autumn (June to October; ISO weeks 2021-25 to 2021-40). We 215 believe this to be a summer holiday effect as international travel increased after a year with 216 many electing to have a \"staycation\" in 2020, so there is an increase in imported cases 217 during this time. 218 14 .

The ran- 222 dom effects for region are greater for the large regions (Geneva/GE, Basel/BS and BL, 223 Zug/ZH, and Zurich/ZH) in the endemic component (Figure 9). Bordering regions Ticino 224 (TI), Geneva (GE), Basel (BS and BL) and Schaffhausen (SH) have smaller effects in the 225 epidemic component which may be due to cross-border medical seeking behaviour. The 226 gravity model is included in the region-based model. The effect is positive indicating that 227 there is more influx from larger populations (urban centres) and so we would expect to 228 see more cases in such regions. It seems stable across models considered. The linear time 229 trend does not seem to contribute much, indicating the yearly-duration sine-cosine waves 230 may capture most of the fluctuation. The sine-cosine waves are most similar in the epi- 231 demic component (() sin and() sin ), which is more pronounced for the model with regions. 232 The overdispersion is largest for the model without vaccination coverage but is similar 233 for the model selected. 234 4.2 Contacts 235 There is a greater effect of vaccination coverage ( ) in the epidemic component ()236 than the endemic component ()when both are included in the models for age group but 237 effect in the endemic component is much smaller than seen in the regional model in the 238 age group-based models with tighter confidence bands. There is no common pattern for 239 the fixed effect of age group () \u00b7 indicating that this could be an important effect to in- 240 clude. Such an effect was not included in the endemic component () \u00b7 due to convergence 241 issues. The sine-cosine waves are again rather stable in the epidemic component. The 242 overdispersion is largest for the model without vaccination coverage but experiences a 243 greater decrease when this covariate is included for the models with age groups. The linear 244 time trend again does not seem to contribute much to the models. 245 17 .

We find that regions with lower vaccination 250 coverage such as Glarus (GL), Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI), and Sankt Gallen (SG) have a 251 greater drop in cases under a scenario of increased uptake of vaccination (see the support- 252 ing information (file models-regions) for regional prediction plots) in ISO weeks 2021-30 253 and 2021-38. Overall less cases would be expected if more vaccines had been distributed 254 (Figure 10). 255 We also see that the age-based distribution scheme is evident in the comparison with 256 an alternative as the greatest expected increases initially are among those groups vacci- 257 nated first; over 65 year olds. We see an overall decrease in expected cases for younger age 258 groups. The age group 5059 is the youngest group to not only experience decreases but 259 first see an increase then a decrease. This occurs at different times (ISO week 2021-34 for 260 5059, 2021-37 for 6069, and and 80+ ) but after week 2021- 261 38 all age groups would be expected to have fewer cases (see the supporting information 262 (file models-age) for prediction plots by age group). On average, an increase would be 263 expected but at the end of the study period less cases would be expected. A distribution 264 scheme which is more uniform across age groups leads to predicted proportions of cases 265 19 .

The vaccination coverage is 269 constructed in such a manner that is also takes into account waning immunity . The meth- 270 ods chosen for this work are relevant for case counts arising from a surveillance system for 271 notifiable diseases and so are useful for researchers and public health agency staff who in- 272 teract with such systems daily . The use of these models enable us to explore public health- 273 related questions and concerns using statistically sound methodology . 274 This work complements our earlier work on time-varying weights in endemic-epidemic 275 models [see 5-7]. The question for infectious disease models with transmission weight ma- 276 trices has always been and remains how do you choose which matrix to use. Replacing 277 who-acquires-infection-from-whom matrices with empirical or synthetic contact matrices 278 provided freedom from making assumptions of specific mixing patterns. However, during 279 a public health emergency such as COVID-19, assumptions of constant transmission op- 280 portunities may be violated due to disease control measures enacted. In such a setting the 281 choice of a constant matrix becomes non-trivial as non-outbreak settings (where surveys 282 of transmission opportunities are traditionally conducted) may no longer be representative 283 at short or long term scale and is is not obvious what should be chosen in such a setting. 284 For this reason, we adjusted the matrices to reflect situational changes using external in- 285 formation (policy and mobility). This does not fully answer the question but is an attempt 286 at determining which transmission weight matrices to use. As the changes to different con- 287 tact settings are not as obvious as in previous work [see 6, 7, and note the two flat lines 288 in the bottom left panel in Figure 1], we effectively only have changes to contacts driven 289 by specific locations. For other researchers wishing to do similar modelling, it should also 290 be noted that the mobility data informing mrtis only made available until May 2022 after 291 which time it is no longer provided. This is an example of why private corporations should 292 not be in charge of data gathering for emergency response-access or collection can and 293 21 .

In constructing such scenarios, we did not consider the sit- 294 uation of no vaccination as examined by Zwahlen and Staub [27] in their considerations 295 of expected excess deaths in the absence of vaccines. As they note, an endemic situation 296 with no vaccines and no disease control in place is unlikely . We would thus expect to see 297 certain contrasting effects in the time-varying transmission weights and the time-varying 298 vaccination coverage. 299 We showed that the endemic-epidemic modelling framework can be used to project the 300 COVID-19 pandemic under different scenarios of vaccination coverage. This was possible 301 as we worked with highly structured vaccine coverage data (which was stratified by week, 302 age group, and region). The objective of this project was to determine the role of vaccines 303 in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland incorporating the specific demographics 304 of the country to improve the understanding of the impact of vaccination on the ongoing 305 pandemic. Statistical modelling was used with epidemiological data to determine the effect 306 unvaccinated or under-vaccinated groups have on the spread of COVID-19 in other parts of 307 Switzerland as well as the impact of the vaccination strategy used (age-based distribution). 308 The strength of our modelling work is the ability to project the epidemic under dif- 309 ferent scenarios for vaccination coverage taking into account waning. The highly struc- 310 tured case and vaccine data (given by weeks t, age group a, and region r) allows us to 311 obtain multivariate predictions providing stratified mean incidence. This is uniquely in- 312 formative and provides granular estimates of changes in numbers of cases. An alterna- 313 tive approach which would not allow for the evaluation of the vaccination coverage effect 314 estimate (which was the focus of this work) but which could be used to examine similar 315 research questions as considered here would be to inform the time-varying transmission 316 weights by the level of vaccination coverage. We have not considered such an approach 317 in this work as it is out of scope but mention it should other researchers wish to attempt 318 it. Meyer et al. [26] note that when you assume a common intercept for the unit, you do 319 not have to exclude units without reported cases. This should not be an issue here based 320 on visual inspection of the outcome variable data. Later developments [12] have examined 321 how to incorporate low case counts in endemic-epidemic models and may be another op- 322 22 .

This is based in the law of mass action which relies on a homogeneous mix- 325 ing assumption. We believe that our inclusion of time-varying heterogeneous contact and 326 spatial dispersion matrices as well as allowing the vaccination coverage to vary over time 327 relaxes some of the unrealistic aspects of such an assumption. Our work implicitly assumed 328 that in the scenarios of increased uptake of vaccines the alternative amount of vaccine 329 would be available which might not be the case in reality and so we note that our work 330 provides optimistic estimates. Because the Swiss national identity is very divided (Switzer- 331 land itself has notable linguistic divisions), it is perhaps not so surprising that Ticino (TI) 332 had early uptake of vaccines (Figure 3.2) as those residents would all other things equal 333 be assumed to have read more of the Italian language reporting on COVID-19; Italy being 334 the early European epicentre in 2022 could have had an impact. However, Rudolf Steiner- 335 based initiatives are head-quartered in Switzerland (particularly in Solothun (SO) which 336 never achieves the maximum vaccination coverage in the study period) and are known to 337 harbour pseudo-scientific and anti-vaccination sentiments [1] which could serve as a hin- 338 drance to improvements in vaccination and health. Waldorf school-driven outbreaks of 339 infectious diseases are a known epidemiologic issue [28]. With even more granular infor- 340 mation, the effects of undervaccinated school districts could be explored. 341 Much has been discussed about herd immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic after 342 the introduction of vaccines. Herd immunity is the proportion of population that needs to 343 be vaccinated in order to curb disease spread. The modelling approach used here can in 344 future also be used to examine the effects of achieving herd immunity , once this threshold 345 has been fully determined for this disease. 346 ORCID 347 M.
