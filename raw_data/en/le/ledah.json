Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body's natural defense system [(immune system)](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/sti150867/sti150867-sec) attacks your body's healthy tissues instead of attacking only things like bacteria and viruses. This causes inflammation. Some people with lupus have only mild symptoms. But the disease is lifelong and can become severe. Lupus may cause problems with your skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, nerves, or blood cells. Systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common and most serious type of lupus. But there are other types of lupus. They include or cutaneous causes it? The exact cause of lupus isn't known. Experts believe that some people are born with certain genetic mutations that affect their immune systems and make them more likely to get lupus. What are the symptoms? Lupus symptoms vary widely, and they come and go. Common symptoms include feeling very tired and having joint pain or swelling [(arthritis)](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/sta123319/sta123319-sec), a fever, and a [skin rash](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/tp10886/tp10886-sec). You may have mouth sores and hair loss. Over time, some people with lupus have problems with the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood cells, or [nervous system](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stn166121/stn166121-sec). How is it diagnosed? There is no single test for lupus. Your doctor will check for lupus by examining you, asking you questions about your symptoms and past health, and doing some blood and urine tests. He or she will check for certain criteria to help diagnose lupus. These criteria include the butterfly rash and joint swelling. How is lupus treated? Treatment for lupus may include antimalarial medicines to treat fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes, [corticosteroid](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stc123754/stc123754-sec) cream for rashes, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for mild joint or muscle pain and fever. Corticosteroid pills may be prescribed if other medicines don't control your symptoms. How can you manage it? One of the goals of controlling mild to moderate lupus symptoms is to prevent flares. You can: - Get plenty of rest. Some people with lupus need up to 12 hours of sleep every night. - Avoid the sun. Wear sunscreen and protective clothing when you are outside. - Exercise regularly to prevent fatigue and joint stiffness. - Pace yourself. Don't do too many activities. - Stop smoking. - Watch your symptoms. If they seem to be getting worse, take steps to control them. For example, if your fatigue, pain, or rash gets worse, it may be a sign of a flare. - Talk with your doctor about any vaccines you may need. With good self-care, most people who have lupus can keep doing their regular daily activities. Help your family and friends understand your limits and needs when your symptoms flare. Build a support system of family, friends, and health professionals. What Increases Your Risk The chances of getting lupus are higher in people who: - Are female. - Are Black. - Are ages 15 to 45. - Have a family history of lupus. - Take medicines that are linked with drug-induced systemic lupus. Symptoms Lupus symptoms vary widely, and they come and go. The times when symptoms get worse are called relapses, or flares. The times when symptoms are under control are called remissions. Common symptoms include: - Fatigue. Increased fatigue is a classic sign that a symptom flare is about to happen. - Joint pain or swelling (arthritis). - A fever. - A [skin rash](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/tp10886/tp10886-sec). Many people have a [butterfly rash](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/tp10886/tp10886-sec) over the cheeks and bridge of the nose. Skin sores or flaky red spots may appear on the arms, hands, face, neck, or back. - Exposure to [ultraviolet light](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stu3172/stu3172-sec) (such as sunlight or tanning parlors) typically makes the skin rash worse and can trigger lupus flares. - Mouth sores. - Hair loss. - Raynaud's syndrome. This causes fingers and toes to turn white and blue or red. The skin feels numb, tingly, and cold. Over time, some people with lupus have problems with the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, blood cells, or [nervous system](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stn166121/stn166121-sec). What Happens The course of lupus varies by individual. It's hard to predict because symptoms come and go. You may not notice the symptoms for a long time. But sometimes lupus develops rapidly. The times when you have symptoms are called flares or relapses. Remissions are times when your symptoms are under control. Flares and remissions can occur abruptly and without clear cause. There is no way to predict how bad a flare will be or how long it will last. During a flare, you may have new symptoms plus those you have had in the past. Children can get lupus. But it usually develops in the teen years or later. When vital organs are involved, lupus in children appears to be more severe than in adults. There are also concerns if you have lupus and are pregnant. Some people with lupus have kidney and heart problems. But most people live a normal or near-normal lifespan. Things that trigger lupus flares Certain things can trigger lupus flares. These may include: - Exposure to ultraviolet light. This is usually from sunlight. - Smoking. Smoking can trigger flares and may also make them more severe. - Some medicines. - Some infections. Some people who have [cytomegalovirus (CMV)](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stc123783/stc123783-sec), parvovirus (such as [fifth lupus. The [Epstein-Barr virus](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/ste122094/ste122094-sec) has been linked to lupus in children. - Chemical exposure. Suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica dust. Hair dyes and straighteners, linked to lupus in the past, are no longer thought to trigger it.

Who to see To evaluate initial symptoms and treat mild lupus, you can talk with: For long-term management of complicated lupus, talk with: - A rheumatologist. - An immunologist. For more complicated cases of lupus, a rheumatologist is usually the primary doctor. Other specialists are consulted as needed. - For mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, or other behavioral changes, see your family medical doctor or internist, or a [psychiatrist](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/ps2126/ps2126-sec). - For the treatment of organ problems, a doctor who specializes in diseases of that particular organ system may work together with a rheumatologist or immunologist. The following practitioners typically treat vital organ problems caused by lupus: Exams and Tests There is no single test for lupus. Because lupus affects different people in different ways, it can be hard to diagnose. It can take time for symptoms to develop. And sometimes it takes weeks to years to diagnose. Your doctor will give you an exam and ask questions about your symptoms and past health. He or she will check for certain criteria to help diagnose lupus. These include a [butterfly rash](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/tp10886/tp10886-sec), joint swelling, fatigue, being sensitive to sunlight, and mouth or nose sores. If you have lupus symptoms and you have a positive antinuclear antibody test result, you may not need more testing. If your doctor feels that you do need more tests, you may have one or more of these tests: - Other antibody blood tests - Complement test - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein - Complete blood count - Urinalysis - Lupus anticoagulant test Learn more Treatment Overview Lupus treatment can be complicated. Symptoms vary, and flares and remissions can still happen. But the goal of treatment is to find a balance between controlling your symptoms, preventing organ damage, and having fewer side effects. Treatment for mild lupus may include: - Antimalarial medicines. They can treat fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and skin rashes. [Corticosteroid](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stc123754/stc123754-sec) cream for rashes. [Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](/healthresources/encyclopedia/document/stn166055/stn166055-sec). These can treat mild joint or muscle pain and fever. - Corticosteroid pills. They're used if other medicines don't control your symptoms. If your lupus causes or threatens organ damage, is life-threatening, or has a serious impact on your quality of life, you may also need to take: - Corticosteroids in higher doses. These may be in pills or through a vein in your arm (I.V.). - Medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressants). Some people get serious kidney disease that can't be controlled with medicine. They may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.
