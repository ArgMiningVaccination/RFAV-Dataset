Considering different conditions under autism's umbrella is a mandate primarily because its presentation can differ majorly from person to person. However, kids with autism can have similar traits that can affect them emotionally, socially, physically, and cognitively. Everyone may know many forms of autism and how it generally affects the central nervous system. The signs of the condition can range from hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity and self-stimulating behaviors. Moreover, kids with autism characteristically experience auditory, visual, and tactile sensations that often feel overwhelming. This can lead to avoidance and escape behaviors to mitigate or alleviate the offending stimulus. However, this can fluctuate a great deal between individuals. Some also have issues dealing with large crowds, while others find certain fabrics binding or unbearably itchy. Also, some are disturbed by sounds in the background that commonly people might not even notice. Hypersensitivity often leads to self-stimulating behaviors known as stimming. The term stimming generally refers to odd behaviors or mannerisms that people with the condition do as a self-calming technique. This can be rocking back and forth, hand flapping, making repetitive vocalizations, or even self-biting. The common populace can find such behaviors to be quite odd or unacceptable. There is no specific cause for autism spectrum disorder. Given the condition's complexity and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are likely multiple causes. Both genetics and environment may play a major role. The condition appears to be caused by a variety of genes. Autism spectrum disorder can be linked to genetic conditions like Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome in some kids. Genetic variations or mutations may increase the chances of the condition in other kids. Other genes may affect brain growth or communication between brain cells. Sometimes, they may influence the seriousness of signs. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others seem to happen by chance. Researchers are currently examining whether viral infections, medicines, pregnancy difficulties, and air pollution play a role in the onset of autism spectrum disease. One of the major controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a connection exists between childhood vaccines and the condition. Regardless of extensive research, no reliable study has shown a relationship between autism and any vaccines. In fact, the real study that ignited the debate several years ago has been retracted due to the bad design and questionable research methods. Also, avoiding childhood vaccinations can place your kid and others in danger of catching and spreading severe conditions such as whooping cough, mumps, and measles.
