The AAP strongly encourages that all patientswithCOVID -19 be cleared for participation by their primary care physician prior to returning to sporting activities. The American College of Cardiology also endorses evaluation and clearance of children who have had COVID -19 prior to returning to physical activity. The ACC provides an overview of the evaluation, including an algorithm to assist providers in their assessment and follow -up in their recent artic le, Returning To Play After Coronavirus Infection: Pediatric Cardiologists' Perspective . The ACC summarizes with the followi ng: Returning to sports participation after a COVID infection will be a significant question posed to pediatric providers in the coming months The approach to sports participation clearance in pediatric patients should differ from the approach in adult pat ients Most pediatric patients will be able to be easily cleared for participation without extensive cardiac testing, but pediatric providers should ensure patients have fully recovered and have no evidence of myocardial injury The ACC Evaluation Algorithm can be found here Munson Healthcare will be providing a Friday Medical Conference CME presentation on this topic: Friday Medical Conference*CME Fri., Oct. 16, 12:30 - 1:30 pm | The Impact of COVID -19 on the Pediatric Myocardium: Spectrum from Asymptomatic Patients to MISC -C Scott Maurer, MD | Pediatric Cardiologist, Michigan Medicine Continued Reopening of Services Below are the Munson Healthcare service updates for this week.

Providers are strongly encouraged to get their vaccination from their primary care provider or from a local pharmacy. You, or your practice manager, are asked to submit the appropriate paperwork to your facility Employee Health office (email p referred) by the Oct. 31 deadline. Flu vaccination clinics and/or peer vaccinations will also be held at locations throughout the system in October. Clinic details will be shared next week. Frequently Asked Questions Are there any exemptions to gettin g the flu vaccine? Exemptions may be made for someone with a prior severe anaphylactic reaction to the flu vaccine; people with a history of Guillain -Barre syndrome \u2014 if diagnosed within six weeks of receiving previous flu vaccine; and if you have a risk o f a serious adverse effect due to a serious medical condition. All exemptions granted for the 2019 -2020 flu season will be reviewed for the 2020 -2021 flu season. Anyone who was granted an exemption last year and has not had a change in medical condition, d oes not need to submit a request for an exemption this year. All Exemption Requests must be submitted by Oct. 15 to your facility Employee Health office. What PPE are those giving the vaccine required to use? All flu vaccinations will be given following s tandard infection prevention guidelines for administration of vaccines per MIOSHA standards. That includes sanitizing hands in between vaccinations and wearing proper PPE. In certain circumstances, such as a known bleeding disorder, those giving vaccinatio ns may also wear gloves. No Piggybacking Reminder This is a reminder to all members of the Healthcare Team: Please do not allow \"piggybackers\" or \"tailgaters\" to follow you into entrances that require badge access. This is especially important during COVID -19, as people trying to gain access to our facilities need to complete a health screening first and should be directed to the entrances where screenings are being conducted. We understand that it can be awkward to tell someone you can't let them in and suggest saying something like, \"I'm sorry, but you need a badge to enter through this door. Let me help direct you to the nearest entrance.\" Allowing \"piggybackers\" in compromises the safe ty, security, and welfare of our Healthcare Team and patients. "}
