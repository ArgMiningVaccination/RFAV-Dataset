However this seems less likely and Schmeiser claimed that he harvested seeds from the entire field. Since the court was never able to prove if he sprayed Roundup or isolated seeds, these angles of investigation were dropped. Some people cite this as proof that Schmeiser never isolated seeds or sprayed roundup, but the courts never found actual evidence confirming Schmeiser's claims, and the issue of how the concentration increased so drastically has never been resolved. Schmeiser still argues that he was innocent - but claims that he never wanted RR seed - so why did he save, plant, and spray seed that he knew was contaminated? Since the courts found that he was completely knowledgeable about the RR canola's presence, wanted it to dominate the field, and had the \"standby\" option of using roundup on his crop, Monsanto won the lawsuit. 13:23[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Seeds_of_Death&action=edit\u00a7ion=33)] |Both in Canada and the United States, hundred of farmers have been totally bankrupted, lost their farms, lost them by Monsanto.

So it's total control eventually that farmers have to go back to a corporation like Monsanto each year to buy their seed because they're no longer allowed to use their own seed, so, as a victim, you basically have to pay for your lawsuit, your damages, and so on. So farmers have become victims because they have done nothing wrong, because they were contaminated by a neighbor, by whatever means, by pollen flow, by seed blowing in the wind transportation and so on.

There is limited evidence indicating that glyphosate could have an effect on disease susceptibility, but there's no evidence demonstrating that this actually happens with RR crops.| Furthermore, the preceding claim doesn't do a good job of explaining HOW glyphosate works. Glyphosate works by inhibiting the shikimate pathway via the EPSPS enzyme. The glyphosate inhibits the enzyme, which causes the whole pathway to fail, making it impossible for the plant to produce aromatic amino acids, killing the plant.

Producers are freaked out because the choice is not going to be for them.|| Since when was this about capitalism? What does capitalism have to do with this anyways? And besides, mandatory, government-enforced labels are the exact opposite of \"pro-capitalist\". Capitalism is about market freedom, not market restriction, and especially not about idiotic restrictions. Nobody gives a shit about if you want to know. Yet for some reason the GMO activists believe that their precious \"Contains GMOs\" label deserves laws making it mandatory, while a just as useless \"Mexican-picked\" label to appease people concerned about migrant labour apparently doesn't. | But hey, it's pretty ironic, him mentioning choice... USDA Organic and Non-GMO project labels are the very definition of choice. Voluntary, market-produced choice. Those options are practically the golden examples of the market meeting a need, and yet this guy believes that mandatory labeling is pro-capitalism. It is very obvious that all the rhetoric about \"choice\" coming from anti-GMO activists is utterly dishonest. They actually want to remove choice by forcing GM food out of the market with lies, propaganda and pseudoscience.

And we're going to get to that point but it's going to require as I often put it \"the food fight of our lives\".|| For X thousand years humans did Y without Z. | You can use computers, cell phones, the internet, chemotherapy, hybrid crops, whatever the hell you want as an example. It's just not a valid argument. It is just a poor attempt to Oddly enough, only one industry is trying to destroy the other industry here. The biotech industry thrives off of seed sales.
