More and more healthcare institutions and agencies are coming to understand the value of true integrative practices for their patients. New research on Yoga Therapy shows the efficacy of this modality to address patient concerns with stress, anxiety and even pain management. This elite program, offered in partnership with Howard County Hospital, will provide you with unique experiential training to help position you in a private practice for specific populations, with an integrative health focus. It is also beneficial for learning specific techniques in patient care at an acute hospital. This Professional Certificate program, the first in the nation of its kind, offers the opportunity to immerse, learn and grow as a yoga therapist and provide private sessions to patients' bedside in an acute care setting. Each day you will interact with hospital medical staff; participate in doctors' grand rounds; and provide therapeutic yoga practices (gentle movements, breath work, meditation, and life balance practices) to patients facing various acute health challenges. You will implement patient interview and assessment skills to determine the best plan of care to decrease symptoms, boost vitality, and restore overall balance for each patient. In addition, you will refine the process of succinct session documentation and data collection, including patient feedback to track patient outcomes. You will be part of a supportive team of experienced supervisors and yoga therapy colleagues, all with the goal of bridging the gap between holistic treatments and allopathic modalities to increase self-awareness, self-care practices, and an overall sense of wellbeing for each patient. After each session, you will have the opportunity to reflect upon your personal experience during the process with the supervisor and gain feedback on all aspects of the session and your performance. This certificate program will prepare you with the hands-on experience necessary to create a similar program to offer evidence-informed individualized yoga therapy in a clinical setting near you.
