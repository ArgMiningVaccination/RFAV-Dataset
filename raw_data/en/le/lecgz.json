Cognitive and Emotional Development SHA Wellness Clinic promotes the ability to manage stress to find the perfect balance and successfully perform cognitive tasks. SHA uses a multidisciplinary approach combining current scientific knowledge with state-of-the-art technology to carry out mental health evaluations along with exercises and activities aimed at developing the brain's full potential. Carried out by Professor Bruno Ribeiro do Couto, Head of the Cognitive Improvement and Emotional Health Unit at SHA Wellness Clinic, the neurocognitive assessment includes an evaluation of higher mental functions, with training in key skills such as relaxation, concentration and overcoming phobias with the use of advanced technology. During the consultation, bioelectric impulses are used to modulate the functioning of specific areas of the brain and enhance cognitive function. Neuropriming increases hyperplasticity to facilitate the brain's ability to adapt to an activity, increasing and strengthening motor units and muscle fibres.

Complementary treatments seek to strengthen the immune system and enhance the body's own healing power.

The experience includes an acupuncture session to harmonise the organism and stimulate the body's ability to balance the flow of energy, helping maintain and recover health.
