The Committee is in the process of creating a document to explain the 100 -bed agreement . Mr. Terry Horn stated that t he UNMH BOT Community Engagement Committee was creat ed three years ago by former Chair, Mr. Jerry McDowell, because there was some thought there may be some gaps in the hospital's engagement with the Community and perhaps the Bo ard of Trustees could be useful . The committee has been c haired by Mr. Jo seph A larid for the past year. Upon further review it was determined the current Outreach by the hospital is robust ; therefore, it was determined this Committee is no longer required. Chair Horn stated s ubject to discussion, he will request an approval at the next Board of Trustees Meeting for disbandment of the Committee; however, in the future if there is a need for the Board to get involved in Outreach, it will be discussed and determined at a Board M eeting. Mr. Alarid stated that the function of the full Board of Trustees is to represent the community and be cognizant of our engagement as an institution; there is no need for a separate committee . Mrs. Kate Becker stated Outreach Reports will be pres ented to the Board of Trustees periodically. Mr. Del Archuleta stated he is supportive and that all of the Board of Trustees come from different aspects of the community and when necessary the staff can advise if assistance is needed by Members to get inv olved with Outreach concerns . Mr. Erik Lujan stated part of the purpose of creating the committee was an access issue because some community members were concerned about accessing information , staff and Board Meetings . Mr. Lujan stated 4 -5 years ago we struggled as an organization in promoting Outreach meetings to verify from those in the community that sometimes feel they are not being heard to stated their concerns and feel they were being heard. However, Mr. Lujan believes the organization is currentl y doing a lot better in getting viewpoints heard and in getting communication out in to the community. X.

On February 3rd I came into the ER due to discoloration in my foot, and increased pain and weakness in my left leg . I ended up being admitted for pain management as the discoloration was determined to be a side effect of the chemo I was receiving. Upon the routine blood work that is done it showed that my hemoglobin levels were low in the red, so I was all set up for my 3rd blood transfusion. At first everything was fine, until next thing I know I was being told that I was being intubated becaus e the blood I got had CMV, I was placed under heavy sedation for I think 2 days or more, I was in the Trauma ICU for most of my stay, they took really good care of me. Made me feel welcome and truly cared about, I wish I were able to thank each and every nurse and Tec on team that took such good care of me, I cannot remember all of their names (I am really bad at remembering names) that cared for me in MICU, but they were all amazing. I was then moved to Carrie Tingly ICU overflow I was there a day in a half maybe, and the team that took care of me there were just as amazing and caring. I then finished my stay on the Oncology Ward, 5 East. Each and every person that came in to my room to care for me, made me feel at home, made me feel as though I truly mattered to them that I was not just another patient sent up to be cared for. They greeted me as if they have known me for many years. Granted I have been inpatient quite a few times for different things, since being diagnosed with a very aggressive Cancer, and have seen them in passing, or maybe one night of my stay they were on my care team. I have been inpatient now for 20 days I am suppose to be discharged tomorrow 2/23/21 God willing, and it is bitter sweet to be honest. 10/57I have not been away from my family this long before.......... I have a 10 year old daughter she is a trooper and has been so brave and strong thru this, even through all the tears she cried because I was not able to come home and be with her and she was very scared and still is. It has also been very hard on my dad as he has lost both his parents in the past 6 months and fear is very high. At times I was shocked that I made it through the day or the night without completely losing my mind, I did have one episode where I lost it and sobbed for nearly 2 hours. The care and concern and words of encouragement I heard and saw in their faces made me feel better. Made me feel even more like family and if it were not for the restrictions of giving hugs I would of hugged everyone. * Whenever I needed them for something they were on it, when I would apologize for bothering them when I needed something they reassured me that it is not anything to be sorry about that that is why they are here. I honestly feel that if it were not for the amazing team I had I would not of been able to get as relaxed as I did and would not of been able to get better as quickly, as I am being told I recovered. Everyday, morning, noon, and night, they greeted me with a smile and kind words, I feel as though even though I was away from my biological family, that I was adopted into the family I have grown to love and care about here. It is bitter sweet knowing that I may be discharged before I am able to say goodbye to everyone, so if this letter can be given to them I will be so happy. I wish there was a way that I could stay connected with them and send occasional say Facebook messages if it does not cross any policy that says this is a no -no to them just to see how they are doing and let them know how much I owe them for everything they have done for me. Never once did I have someone including the nursing students who were amazing as well was there the awkward silence we always found something to talk about even if it were just talking about the weather. 11/57Their patience is amazing.......... I felt overwhelmed with their kindness... Another thing Chemo brain is definitely a thing when it is, it's really annoying and I will say something, then end up repeating what I said I would get annoyed and would be told not to worry that its no big deal it happens and it would be brushed off, which is really helpful because at times it happens and I get so confused and so upset that I get really mad and discouraged that I would give up on what I am trying to say. Even more so when I am needing to ask for something and the nurse comes in and I have forgotten what it was I was needing their is patience amazing. *I suffer from mental ick that at times my thoughts tell me what an inconvenience to others I am and that what I may need is not important to others just to suck it up and hurry up and wait. But it was not like that with them for example, I page them to say use the restroom and five minutes later I am paging them again because I am drinking water like crazy and I have to go again, they come in smiling and ready to help and clean up my bed for me so when I am done in the restroom I have fresh bed to climb into. *Please let them know, how amazing I think they are. And how much I appreciate them, and everything they have done for me. I feel like a completely different person and it is because of them, I feel so down to earth and had a lot of time to sel f reflect. I don't know any other way to repay them other than to let them know how much I have grown to love and care, about them all and wish them the best in life and any goal they may set for themselves, it is clear for each and every one of them how much they truly care about the people they take care of. They treat me as more than just a paycheck. I felt overwhelmed with the kindness. You can clearly see and feel the passion they have for what they do. If it is possible to send this to the Nursing students instructors as well I would be grateful, as they were just as wonderful and helpful. 12/57Teamwork As you can see the patient went to all 3 of the ICUS as well as 5E and the kindness and compassion was shown on each unit she was on. This speaks to the culture of our areas and the collaborative teamwork that is done on the units day after day When I round with patients the We Care theme is present when patients talk about our staff. 13/57Separator Page FY21 Revised 517 441 -15% 435 19/57Total Operating Revenue decrease ($53.5 million) Inpatient access and throughput increase $29.7 million -Increase UNMH discharges 8%, reduction in Adult LOS -additional 1,890 discharges -Maintain ratio of Adult IP/Observation discharges Increase clinic & surgical volumes Primary Care Clinics preliminary increase 1% Specialty Clinics preliminary increase 8% Surgeries preliminary increase 9% Case Mix Index decrease ($39.8 million) COVID -19 patients had higher acuity 20/57Medicare decrease ($2.8 million) Additional COVID payment Medicaid Reductions ($41.2 million) Medicaid outlier change ($27.1 million) Impacts FFS and MCO Impacts IME NM HSD update cost to charge ratio -will do annually Other Medicaid changes decrease ($14.1 million) No other pending payer contract changes 21/570.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%20.0%25.0%30.0%35.0%40.0% Medicare Medicaid Commercial Charity/Self-Pay Gov't, USPHS/IHS, OtherGross Revenue Payer Mix by Year FY2020 Actual Gross RevenueFY2021 Projected Gross Revenues FY2022 Budgeted Gross Revenue 22/570.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0% Medicare Medicaid Commercial Charity/Self-Pay Gov't, USPHS/IHS, Other Other Operating RevenuesNet Operating Revenue Payer Mix by Year FY2020 Actual Net RevenueFY2021 Projected Net Revenues $ 1,151,859,081 $ 1,307,913,187 $ Support (10,066,836) Non Operating Revenues 8,709,789 29,329,979 67,959,469 125,727,134 $ 49,804,550 $ Radiology -(IR, portable units, ultrasound) Sonopet ultrasounds, other equip.) -$3M Lab Fluoroscopy Senior Health/Movement Disorder All other inpatient and ancillary -$6.5M Renovations -$28M Movement Disorder & Senior Care Clinics -$13M Clinics (code required renovations, Ophthalmology) -$4.6M Life safety, HVAC, Electrical, Medical Vacuum -$4.3M Behavioral Health (Psychiatric emergency service expansion) -$2.3M Ancillary & Other -$3.8M Information Technology -$6M Storage expansion, networking -$3.6M Electronic Medical Record -$1.3M Other clinical and support Revised FY 2022 Budget Ancillary Areas Surgical Services Renovation and Equipment 4,600,000 $ 3,055,302 $ 3,000,000 2,656,905 Lab Equipment and Renovation - 1,721,090 - Other Radiology Equipment and Renovations 3,375,000 2,804,087 2,100,285 Other Ancillary Care Clinic 7,727,477 $ 3,663,384 $ 14,836,616$ Other Clinic Equipment and Renovations 3,295,408 $ 2,142,024 $ $ Budget Life Safety, fire sprinklers, bldg renovations 4,570,000 3,278,171 4,251,521 Plumbing repairs, domestic soil pipe replacement, boiler 2,200,000 $ 796,397 $ 2,250,000 $ Total Building and Infrastructure 6,770,000 $ 4,074,568 $ Project New Tower Prep - Roadwork 5,200,000 - - Total New Tower 5,200,000 $ - $ - $ New Tower Prep -Roadwork has been moved and captured with full project on slide 9 . 34/57 FY 2021 Original FY 2021 Electronic Medical Record 1,100,000 $ 1,100,000 $ 1,331,218 $ Systems upgrades and expansions 1,020,139 1,020,139 700,000 Network 2,896,132 2,360,132 2,819,700 Other IT 983,729 Technology Revised Services ASAP/Carrie Tingely/UNMPC/CPC 3,850,309 $ 2,832,333 $ 3,584,449 $ Total Other Clinical Operations & Support Services 3,850,309 $ 2,832,333 $ 3,584,449 $ 35/57Over $1 CT Scan BBRP CT Scanner (north) 1,825,000 $ In Process Other Equip Cardiac Cath Lab Flex Robotic System 1,080,000 $ Cancelled IT Clinical Application EMR Enhancements 1,100,000 $ In evaluation phase, multiple projects Facilities BBRP - 3 West - Fan Wall HVAC Systems 1,000,000 $ Approved September 2020 BBRP - ED - Improvements 1,000,000 $ Project postponed UH Main - OR - Air Handler Upgrades 1,100,000 $ Project postponed UH Main - Basement Machine Room 8 - Medical Air Compressor Replacement 1,100,000 $ Project postponed UPC - PES - Expansion without IOP Conversion Plan 1,500,000 $ Approved January 2019 1600 University -Ophthalmology Clinic 1,000,000 $ Project postponed $250,000 - $999,999 Facilities Budget BBRP - CT North Room - Replacement and Renovation 350,000 $ Reduced scope;

I could feel, like others, the full-range of emotions with the many memories popping in my mind. This moment was deeply personal and yet we all shared a commo n humanity experience of loss, isolation, stress, marvel, connection to mission, and compassion for the many families who lost loved ones. The marvels of science, rapid adaptability, making due, and teamwork make a difference, and yet we still have much t o do in COVID response and recovery. We do worry that the unrelenting focus and need for compassion has had an impact on the workforce in terms of burnout and wellbeing - they have been resilient but can be so only so long - we must anticipate enhancing our supports for all our caregivers - which means all the faculty, staff, residents, students, and volunteers. Since the end of February, our increased vaccinations and ongoing public health measures have created a sense of hope that we are entering th e new normal soon, although recognizing that other states and nations are continuing to have difficulties or worse conditions. We have administered over 100,000 vaccinations at the PIT and have seen the number of COVID positive cases in our clinical setti ngs drop dramatically. We have entered a critical time period for continued vaccinations and ongoing public health precautions. While I could have a long report of the many accomplishments and activities in our educational, clinical and research areas, I will highlight a few critical areas. Health System CEO Becker and Drs. Richards, Agostini, and Boyd will next provide important health system details in their administrative reports ; however, I wanted to highlight four items: (1) our new UNM Health System Executive Leadership Group formation, (2) our early thinking about sponsoring a Health Equity Summit, (3) our advancement of considerations on how tele -health, tele -communication, and tele - education programs can grow in our Health System as we strive to enhance the health of all New Mexicans, and (4) our upcoming 10 to 100 campaign to increase employee vaccinations and learn lessons to help reduce vaccine hesitancy in our communities. Our Health System Executive Leadership Group is focused on clarif ying a shared vision on what our UNM Health System is and what we aspire to become. What is our unique role in helping all New 40/57Mexicans? We must be grounded in our core values, more deeply understand the historical context of the HSC and commitment to the community, including as a Hispanic Serving Institution and in serving our Native American Community on whose ancestral lands we sit and partner with today. How do we balance priorities of our tertiary and quaternary critical role for the State and our exp anding focus on primary care and population health? How do we assure the primacy of our focus on patient and family care while also integrating our academic missions? Our collective answer to these and other fundamental questions will be summarized, inclu ding acknowledging the creative tensions and issues to address. We look forward to sharing more in the future. I am engaging our leadership team in developing a plan on how to move forward in engaging the community, State, Counties, Cities, and our fa culty, staff, and students in the planning of a Health Equity Summit later this year. We hope to get your ideas and recommendations as this idea grows to fruition. We recognize the vital importance of enhancing health equity and better understanding the needs and priorities of the communities we serve. Earlier this month, CEO Robb McLean, Dr. Sanjeev Arora, and myself presented and dialogued for an hour discussion with the UNM Regents on tele -health, tele -consult, and tele -education. This was a very informative meeting. We are international leaders with Project ECHO in tele -education and tele - mentoring, have just completed a strategic planning process for Virtual Health to grow our expertise in tele-health, and collectively have had experiences in bring ing tele -consult services through State support, ACO development, and to enhance our quality of care within our network. Perhaps at a future meeting we may discuss this topic in more detail. New Mexico is the leading state in vaccinations; however, we n ow can see that vaccine hesitancy is a barrier to getting higher vaccination rates (not availability of vaccines). There are many causes and possible solutions, including the need for trusted partners to some communities. We hope to start by supporting a ll of our employees, faculty, staff, and students to become vaccinated so as to better help our patients and also learn valuable lessons to help our communities. Starting on May 10th we will be launching a 10 to 100 Challenge which is a multimedia effort designed to increase the percentage of employees vaccinated in the UNM Health System with a goal of getting 100% of our UNMH employees to get vaccinated or registered for a vaccination in a 10 day time period. Each day of the 10 -day challenge will focus o n different aspects of the COVID vaccination process, with a dedicated web site, videos, social media hashtags, radio phone banks and the like tackling topics such as vaccine hesitancy, myths about the vaccine and COVID, vaccine use in the LGBTQ+ and indig enous communities, etc. Communication and Marketing has put together a wonderful initiative with people sharing their story, including their worries and experiences on how they decided to get vaccinated. Our larger goal is to gain more insights and exper iences that will help us in our efforts with our patients, families, and communities that we serve. Related to this goal of helping our community, I am excited to share with you about a new $1.4M research grant that we received this week. Our WEAVE NM gr ant (Wide Engagement for Assessing COVID -19 Vaccination Equity) is part of the NIH -funded CEAL (Community Engagement Alliance Against COVID -19 Disparities) grants. WEAVE NM provides UNM HSC with new resources and connections with the NIH and other CEAL si tes in other states to go beyond understanding individual behaviors of vaccine hesitancy, to looking at the systems and policy barriers from a racial equity lens -- engaging with communities across our state and using innovative methodologies such as digita l policy stories (across 41/57urban and rural racial/ethnic communities), catalyst films to understand provider perspectives, and population -based surveys. This grant is a collaboration of three of our existing Centers, including our NIMHD funded Transdiscipli nary Research Engagement and Equity Center (PI/DIrector - Lisa Cacari Stone); the Center for Native American Health (CNAH -Dr. Tassy Parker); and the Center for Participatory Research (Nina Wallerstein). Our goal is to take a deeper dive to understand vaccin e hesitancy across the state, to support community -driven strategies to enhance vaccine uptake, and to build health equity capacities within select urban and rural Native and Hispanic communities and a larger community of practice with over 200 organizatio ns from across the state. Education I want to thank the Health System leadership and front -line workers who are supporting our Health Sciences students and all the students across the University in regards to health, behavioral health, and public heal th matters. The academic year for many HSC students is winding down with most eager to return to learn. Protocols are in place to assure public health measures. Our educational mission has adjusted with the state's color -coded system. We are following the state's guidelines and have been able to open up more spaces for in -person learning and utilization of the library in person. It hasn't been easy as we also have to meet accreditation requirements for our health professions programs. We are gratefu l for our simulation center and online learning that has allowed training to continue. We are working together as one University as we look towards spring graduation, constantly evaluating and reassessing what is safe and supportive. We know this is a tr icky and highly coordinated event with several moving parts so we appreciate the working group who is tasked with trying to find a way to have a safe and celebratory in -person event. Our US News and World Report rankings have just been released. There a re many highlights and also we see the opportunity to create strategies to continue to enhance our reputation in all ranking areas. A few highlights are the ranking of the School of Medicine as #5 in Most Diverse Medical School, as 11th in Family Medicine, 28th for primary care, and 81st in research. Our College of Nursing Nursing -Midwifery program took home the 11th ranking in the country, the nursing Master's Program ranked 60th and the Nursing DNP Program 77th. The College of Pharmacy ranked 43rd. Th e College of Population Health ranked 90th in its field. We are very proud of these rankings but not fully satisfied. I have already engaged main campus, our marketing folks and the deans to make a major push on continued momentum up in the rankings. For the School of Medicine, we have recently celebrated Match Day and have a new class of residents who will be entering our clinics and hospitals in late June. We also are working on expanding and continuing to evolve our SOM diversity office and will soon be posting for an Executive Diversity Office. For our College of Nursing, just want to remind everyone that May 6th is National Nurses Day. Our nurses have been, and always are, such an important part of our patient care. I want to take this moment to say thank you! We are actively working on expanding our clinical placements, including through enhanced IPE opportunities. Our College of Pharmacy has been focusing a lot of effort on attracting out of state students to our Pharm D program. I want to tha nk Dean Godwin who has been innovative, creative and thoughtful to ensure UNM continues to be competitive in this field. 42/57 In our College of Population Health, we continue to explore how we increase the college faculty size, start our first PhD program in Health Equity, and expand our work in Health System Science, including health policy, dissemination and implementation science, and health equity. Diversity Dr. Romero -Leggott and her team have done outstanding work in collaborating with all major units in the Health Sciences Center to create a new Inclusive Excellence Council with great diversity and passion to embrace our diversity and inclusion including enhancing all our efforts to address systemic racism, enhancing the feeling of belonging, and creat ing clear outcomes for all our mission areas and in recruitment, retention, and promotion. Fabi\u00e1n J. Armijo, Director of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) | Interpreter Languages Services (ILS) serves on the IEC as the UNM Hospitals DE&I Executive Offi cer (DEI -EO). An academic health sciences center's achievement of Inclusive Excellence is dependent on how well it includes, engages, and values the communities it is called to serve internally and externally, including the rich diversity of learners, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni, patients, and community members. Stigma, racism, and violence continues. Leadership released a message condemning the recent violence against the Asian American, Pacific Islander community and sharing our concern for the families of the victims. The shootings in Atlanta certainly disturbed us all and brought to the surface the pain and raw emotion many in this community have felt for some time. Our message provided information on needed resources. Research We have had a banner year in Research growth with this year being a record high for Health Sciences. A big thanks to Dr. Larson for his leadership and also the many faculty researchers who continue to make a difference through their discoveries and innova tions. FY21 will bring in $220M, not even counting the additional $237M ECHO grant with Dr. Sanjeev Arora leading this incredible initiative. Of note, the COP is ranked #6 in NIH research funding of 86 Schools of Pharmacy in the nation based on the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research. Congrats!! This year the School of Medicine moved up two rankings to #70 amongst the 151 medical schools in the country. Family and Community Medicine is #11, Pathology is #19, and Neurosciences is #29 in those same Blue Ridge rankings. We are committed to further enhancing our research efforts, through enhanced and new career development programs (including K Award grant training), mentoring training programs, pilot funding, cross -campus and cross -HSC partnership inc entives, and focused research leadership consultations to our Schools, Colleges, and Departments. Provost Holloway, Vice President for Research Ellen Fisher, Executive Vice Chancellor Richard Larson, and I are meeting routinely to enhance cross -campus collaborations and grow our research footprint and showcase more of our research on national and international stages. The UNM HSC is hosting a BioVenture networking event that brings together our New Mexico bioscience companies with our faculty inventors at the HSC and on Main campus in May. Over the last 3 years this event has hosted more than 100 participants each year. 43/57VA Research Collaboration Expansion I am personally very committed to enhancing our partnership with the New Mexico Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. We already have many excellent educational program partnerships; however, there are great opportunities to expand our research collaborations and clinical support for veterans. Director Welch and I meet routinely, and are pleased to announce a new VA - UNM Strategic Advisory Group of leaders from both entities that will initially focus on enhancing our research collaborations and include other matters. Obtaining VA federal research funds will create a new funding stream for our faculty's research efforts as well as bring new resources to New Mexico in the service of veterans in New Mexico and beyond. We have begun to work on a Research MOU, a plan for targeting research funding, and enhancing and establishing needed processes and infrastructure supports. We have recently worked out an Intellectual Property MOU which is an example of specific needed infrastructure supports. In summary, I want to thank you all and also our terrific faculty, staff, residents, students, and volunt eers. I am happy to answer any questions you have and thank you for your time today.

UNMHospitalTower (1).mp4 49/57Separator Irene Agostini, MD UNMH Chief Medical Officer The CMO Board report for April will highlight work around the Medical Peer Review process . Medical Peer Review Medical Peer Review is the process by which health care professionals, including those in nursing and pharmacy, evaluate each other's clinical performance. Peer Review can actually drive quality improvement through posi tive reinforcement. Why is Peer Review Important? Greeley Pyramid \u2014when confronted with a medical staff problem or \"opportunity of improvement\", the idea is to identify what level of the pyramid you are working at and then address in that context. UNMH Peer Review Task Force Convened on Feb. 23 to redesign the Peer Review process. Comprised of representatives from all clinical services. Voted to radically redesign the current system , which is decentralized . Pending approval through Medical Executive Committee (MEC). 51/57 Proposed Peer Review Process Peer Review ultimately reports to MEC, therefore all Peer Review activity acts at levels 2 -4 and does not involve punitive action. The Clinical Chairs, MEC and the credentialing committee would still ultimately remain the principal agents in managing poor performance and taking corrective action. There are many ways in which Peer Review cases can be identified and that system is still being worked out. However, one major method will be from improve d quality and safety reporting. Next Steps Greeley returned to UNMH for three days (March 30 -April 1) and met with all the departments . We will determine the core and specialty specific parameters to track for our quality and safety report cards. The Peer Review Committee will be operational in 6 -7 months. 52/57Separator Page Financials 53/5754/57UNM Hospital YTD 136,185 12,024 17,080 18,189 Mar-21 YTD Prior YTD % Growth ALOS 7.04 7.36 6.61 -11.30% 6.61 -11.29% Case Mix Index 2.09 2.23 2.08 7.01% 724,124$ 9.09% $ (70,170)$ -6.17% Net ** Operating expenses exclude Contract Retail Pharmacy Expense *** Operating expenses exclude Contract Retail Pharmacy & HS Exec Initiatives* CMI Adjusted Patient Days (Adjusted Patient Days X CMI) is to account for the outpatient activities in the hospital and the relative acuity of the patients.
