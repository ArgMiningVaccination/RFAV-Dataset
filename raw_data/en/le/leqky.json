I'm not speaking about this in a religious sense, I'm reflecting on trends in discussions. When I list (below) a few events recent, it helps me place the context in which many of use live and breathe. It is a little stressful to review this list, you might find a few affect or concern you, or many do. If the latter, it can easily develop into an anxious soup. My reason for bringing this up is to reflect on the summery of whats happening, and consider how to ride this wave versus become swept under it. In any situation, how can any of use maintain a flexible mind, and if there is energy, uplift others. This is a quick (not comprehensive) list; our political landscape as it prepares for an election year- and the diomentrically opposed reporting which reflects different realities culture war around race, gender, sex, censorship, political inclinations to name a few weirdly extreme weather events in different parts of the country organized movements such as the SAG-Aftra strike which can potentially topple the entire industry the introduction of AI inflationary pressures a percentage of the population who seem unmotivated/uninterested in work doctors and nurses resigning/retiring, medical facilities understaffed, a system (in my opinion) collapsing... doctors not accepting new patients social fatigue ignited by our last stressful election, compounded by covid digital currencies vs crypto and what that truly signifies social media and how it might magnify/obfuscate the above It is very difficult to summarize all the political changes occurring internationally, but lets consider riots in France, the war in Ukraine and its humanitarian impact on neighboring countries, China's steadily progressing Belt and Road initiative, international fights over resources such as metals, looming territory/border skirmishes/wars, and the horrifying business of human trafficking. My thoughts on getting through this (thinking about the long game), whatever is to come, is to be solid within oneself, to the best of one's ability. Churning may come and go, certainly storms do this (real weather). To address this mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually, the following ideas come to mind, some of which I suggest you explore : the best quality [nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070365/)you can afford, adequate [hydration](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/effects-of-hydration-status-on-cognitive-performance-and-mood/1210B6BE585E03C71A299C52B51B22F7) [social](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9560615/)support creativity- finding avenues for personal expression, whether it be cooking, journal, writing a short story or poem, painting, drawing, rearranging a room, dressing differently, writing music, playing an instrument, singing, dancing- giving the brain a chance to play and a stretch a side alternative to over-thinking, intellectualizing or worry intellectually challenging projects/hobbies, to stretch the mind, hone concentration and focus, offer the brain something to problem solve so it can redirect itself away from any worries which may be out of the sphere of influence [walking, exercise](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/best-exercises-to-ease-stress-and-anxiety), sports, or if mobility is an issue, can hot baths relieve stress mind quieting practices (meditation, breath awareness, breath exercises), prayer, whatever speaks to you disengaging from: television social media entertainment (movies, mini-series) sugar, alcohol, substances While much of whats listed is quite physical, many have layers that impact mental, emotional and spiritual health. Let us use the example of sleep which affects [neuroplasticity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28641933/) and [memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921176/) thus impacting integration of information, recovery and [performance for athletes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988893/), stabilizes/ [improves](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26307483) [mood](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-05281-014), and is even associated with improved [strength in older adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32974889/). What can improve sleep? review this [article ](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/healthy-sleep-tips) for insight. One tool that can help improve sleep quality is (video link) [mindfulness ](https://youtu.be/ZX-ZLXWE_jA)meditation, you can read a recent systematic review about its [effectiveness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6557693/) here. The spiritual impact of better sleep? A more rested person can have a wider door for compassion towards themselves or others, or more patience. That is one example which might be more relatable (consider the opposite, how poor sleep can worsen irritability). In my clinical experience, by the time people come to see me, often sleep, diet, work/life balance and physical activity are out of sorts. It may be a chicken-egg issue (what comes first?), the above list can be considered as methods of prevention, modes of support, or part of ones recovery.
