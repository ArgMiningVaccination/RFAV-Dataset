We pursue a cluster-randomized trial across 248 Rwandan villages to understand how a 'standard' package of nutritional, informational, and savings interventions compares not only to an experimental control group but to an additional arm that receives household grants of equal cost to the donor\u2014a cash benchmark . The study follows households with children under the age of ve or women of reproductive age, with an emphasis on the 1,000 day window of opportunity from pregnancy until a child's second birthday (Currie and Almond, 2011). The core program is called Gikuriro, which means 'well-growing child' in Kinyarwanda; it follows USAID's strategy on multi-dimensional approaches to malnutrition, and is implemented by Catholic Relief Services. The benchmarking household grant program was imple- mented by GiveDirectly, a US-based nonprot that specializes in making unconditional household grants via mobile money. These two treatments are compared to a control group, namely, a set of villages that receive neither program. This study conducts a type of cost-eectiveness benchmarking increasingly called for in recent years: thecomparisonofastandardandwidespreaddevelopmentinterventionwiththeoutcomethat would occur if the cost of the intervention were simply given away to the beneciaries. Proponents of cash transfers have suggested that they should be considered the 'index funds' of international development, meaning a benchmark against which other programs are compared (Blattman and Niehaus, 2014). Just as index funds have helped to provide a reference rate of return against which fee-charging nancial managers can be compared, cash transfers of equal cost to the implementer provide an important counterfactual, and establish a hurdle rate that places the burden of proof on complex, overhead-heavy development programs to show that they can justify their costs by generating benets superior to simply disbursing the cost of the program directly to beneciaries.1 The appeal of cash transfer programs as a benchmark lies in their simplicity and scaleability, their low overhead costs, and the extent to which they put aid beneciaries in control of how resources are allocated. The momentum for benchmarking has built as numerous studies have shown meaningful impacts 1For a discussion of the political economy and public nance dimensions of the tradeos between cash and in-kind programs, see Currie and Gahvari (2008) and Jones et al. (2016). 2of cash transfers on important life outcomes in the short term, such as child nutrition (Aguero et al., 2006; Seidenfeld et al., 2014), schooling (Skouas et al., 2001), mental health (Baird et al., 2013; Samuels and Stavropoulou, 2016), teen pregnancy and HIV (Baird et al., 2011), microenterprise outcomes (De Mel et al., 2012), consumer durables (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016), and productive assets (Gertler et al., 2012). The evidence on the long-term impacts of cash transfers is more mixed, but some studies have found substantial impacts (Aizer et al., 2016; Barham et al., 2014; Fernald et al., 2009; Hoynes et al., 2016).2The largest extant literature on benchmarking is based on the comparison of cash aid to food aid (Ahmed et al., 2016; Cunha et al., forthcoming; Hidrobo et al., 2014; Hoddinott et al., 2014; Leroy et al., 2010; Schwab et al., 2013), which has uncovered a fairly consistent result that food aid leads to a larger change in total calories while cash aid leads to an improvement in the diversity of foods consumed. Eorts to benchmark more complex, multi- dimensional programs against cash include BRAC's Targeting the Ultra-Poor program (Chowdhury et al., 2016), microfranchising (Brudevold-Newman et al., 2017), agricultural inputs (Brudevold- Newman et al., 2017), and sustainable livelihoods (Sedlmayr et al., 2017). These studies have typicallystruggledwiththequestionofhowtoanticipatecostsandcompliancewellenoughtorealize an exact cost-equivalent comparison after the fact. Our study provides a methodology incorporating randomization of transfer amounts and ex-post, regression-based cost adjustment that can achieve this objective in a general way. Using a village-level randomization across 248 villages, we compare the Gikuriro program to cash transfers.3Gikuriro deploys the type of multi-pronged approach advocated by Ruel et al. (2013), in which the program aims to improve child nutrition through superior information, direct transfer of productive assets, and improvements in household diet and santation. A similar program in adjacent Burundi was found to decrease child and maternal anemia (Leroy et al., 2016). Gikuriro consistsoffourcomponentstargeteddirectlyatbeneciaryhouseholds: aVillageNutritionalSchool, Farmer Field Learning Schools, Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILCs), and a Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) intervention), as well as a Behavior Change Communication 2For examples of studies that nd dissipating long-term benets, see Baird et al. (2016) and Araujo et al. (2017). Evidence from systematic reviews of cash transfers on schooling (Molina-Millan et al., 2016) and child health (Manley et al., 2013; Pega et al., 2014) has been similarly uneven. 3The village-level study design was motivated both by the clustered nature of the Gikuriro intervention, and helps to allay concerns about the potential for negative spillovers of cash transfers on adjacent controls observed in Haushofer et al. (2015). 3intervention implemented at the village level. This combination has been developed by CRS over the course of many years implementing anti-malnutrition programs across the world. The cash transfer arm, implemented by GiveDirectly, provided unconditional household grants via mobile money, an intervention that has been found to improve consumption and/or dietary diversity in many contexts across Sub-Saharan Africa (Aker et al., 2016; Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016). Transfer amounts were randomized across villages, and within GiveDirectly villages we implemented a household- level experiment whereby beneciary households were randomized to receive one-time, lump-sum transfers, a monthly flow of cash transfers over the duration of the study, or a choice between these two alternatives.

In addition, we report impacts on a set of secondary outcomes including borrowing and savings, fertility, health knowledge and sanitation practices, diseases and mortality, household assets, and the quality of housing stock.5Prior to randomization the survey rm classied households as 'eligible' (identiable using administrative data sources as containing underweight children, or households in the bottom two income categories with children 5 years old or younger or with pregnant or lactating women), or 'ineligible' (everyone else). We can therefore measure impacts both on the mutually agreed-upon intended target population as well as on the study villages as a whole, even in the presence of potential dierences in actual targeting across implementers. We can use the eligible sample to estimate experimental intention-to-treat 4Kayonza is a relatively prosperous district in the far East of the country, with a poverty rate of 24 percent that ranks it behind only the three districts of Kigali NISR (2017). The relative prosperity of the Eastern Province is further reflected in child health measures: outside of Kigali Province, the Eastern Province had in the 2015 Demographic and Health Surveys rates of stunting and underweight, at shares of under-ve children with HAZ and WAZ below -2 standard deviations of 34.8 and 9.2 percent, respectively. However, this district was hit by a severe drought around the time of the baseline. Nyabihu is in the Northwest and is a relatively poor, mountainous, and remote area, with a poverty rate of nearly 40 percent placing it 16th in the country NISR (2017). The Western Province, in which Nyabihu is situated, ranks worst in the country on rates of children stunted and underweight, at 44.9 and 10.1 percent, respectively (DHS, 2016). 5All primary and secondary outcomes were registered prior to receipt of endline data no the American Economic Association RCT Registry, with ID AEARCTR-0002559. 4eects, and the full sample (population weighted) to estimate total causal eects on the average household in study villages. Both implementers made contact with the study subjects and began enrollment immediately after baseline. GD began implementation shortly after the baseline meaning that at endline indi- viduals in that arm had experienced about 12 months of the household grants treatment (running up throughthemonthbeforeendline). Gikurirowasslowerthanthecashprogramtobeginimplementa- tion on the ground; in that arm households had typically experienced 8-9 months of household-level implementation at the time of the endline.6The duration of the RCT component of the study was limited by the fact that local governments wanted to hit targets for the broader, national rollout of nutritional and WASH programming, of which the eight districts covered by the Gikuriro program- ming were a part, and hence we were not able to maintain the control groups for more than one year. To permit a rigorous comparison of cost-eectiveness, we costed both programs in detail prior to, and after, the intervention period, following Levin and McEwan (2001). The ex-ante costing exercise was used to identify the approximate total cost of the Gikuriro intervention, as well as the estimated overhead costs to GiveDirectly of providing household grants in this context. It arrived at an ex-ante cost of $119 per eligible household. We then randomized transfer amounts at the village level in the cash arm across four possible transfer amounts. These amounts were chosen to provide informative benet/cost comparisons across two dierent margins: Gikuriro vs cash, and small versus large cash transfer amounts. Three smaller cash transfer amounts bracket the anticipated cost of Gikuriro per household (ex-ante costs of $77, $119, $41, $84, and $117, respectively); these arms are provide a straightforward window on cost-equivalent impacts. The fourth and much larger transfer arm transferred $532, the amount chosen by GiveDirectly as likely to maximize their own cost-eectiveness given the xed costs in providing cash transfers via mobile money. The inclusion of this arm provides a statistically high- powered way of examining how benet/cost ratios shift as the transfer amount rises. The nal, ex-post costing exercise arrived a cost for Gikuriro of $141.84, and actual GD costs of $66, $111, and $145, meaning realized Gikuriro costs were within the range over which we randomized but 6Since both programs had six months of notice that they would be implementing in the study sample in these two districts and began national-level implementation at the same time, this dierential delay likely reflects a real dierence in the relative ramp-up speeds of cash versus more complex programming. 528 percent higher than the ex-ante number. We present a method to adjust for the randomized GD cost dierentials using linear regression, and hence can provide comparative impacts at exactly equivalent costs to the donor, USAID. Our results provide quite a nuanced view of the relative impact of a highly tailored child malnu- trition program and the cost of the program in cash. The Gikuriro bundle of interventions, costing USAID $142 and delivering $73 in direct benets per household, was successful at delivering gains in savings, a domain that was the target of the SILC intervention (the remaining costs were split between training/capacity building and overhead). It did not lead to improvements in consump- tion, dietary diversity, wealth, child anthropometrics, or anemia within the thirteen-month period of the study. A cash transfer of exactly the same cost to USAID could, because of lower over- heads, deliver $113 in direct benets. Such a transfer allows households to pay down debt, and generates increased investment in productive and consumption assets. A much larger cash transfer costing $567, and transferring $532 per beneciary household) led to across-the-board improvements in consumption-based welfare measures, a substantial improvement in dietary diversity, a drop in child mortality, and modest improvements of about 0.1 standard deviation in the anthropometric indicators of height-for-age, weight-for-age, and mid-upper arm circumference (all signcant at 10 percent or above). Despite 90.9 and 96.9 percent of the eligible households in treatment villages receiving Gikuriro and GiveDirectly, respectively (for the villages as a whole the treatment rates were 19 and 18.3 percent, respectively), neither treatment resulted in suciently widespread bene- ts as to be detectable in the general population, with the exception of an improvement in health knowledge and vaccination rates in Gikuriro villages and vaccination rates in GD large villages. These results are intuitive in many ways. When a program uses targeted interventions, it can at relatively low cost shift a specic set of welfare indicators tied to these behaviors (for example, the strong impacts of Gikuriro's savings groups). If such a program is built on a solid theory of change connecting outcomes such as savings stocks to long-term outcomes, this can be a well-justied use of development assistance. Unconditional cash is spent on many dierent things in terms of sample averages, and hence is hard to detect when the tranfer amount is small but improves outcomes almost across the board as the transfer amount increases. The large cash transfer delivers benets even on outcomes specically targeted by the other program. While it is unsurprising that very large amounts of money show up in consumption and productive assets, the improvements in diet 6and particularly child anthropometrics over such a short period of time are impressive. Further, while it may be unsurprising that the impact of cash transfers scales with amount spent in the way found here, the same may not be true of other types of development intervention that would quickly hit diminishing marginal returns once certain core objectives were achieved. This points to an inherently dierent way of thinking about cash-transfer programs as a 'bench- mark'. While transfer programs maximize scope for choice and therefore provide an important window on beneciary priorities, a comparison to other more targeted programs will inevitably require policymakers to explicitly make tradeos across outcome dimensions, across beneciary populations, and between large benets for concentrated subgroups or small benets that are dif- fuse over a broader target population. By contrast with the index fund analogy, part of the value of cash transfer programs as a benchmark is that they may require donors to be explicit about their preferences, and to justify interventions that constrain beneciary choices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section of the paper lays out the study design, including a detailed decription of the interventions, sampling routine, costing principles, the experimental structure, as well as primary and secondary outcomes. Section 3 presents the core empirical results of the benchmarking exercise, as well as the results of sub-experiments on cash transfer modalities. Section 4 presents the pre-specied analysis of heterogeneity, including by child age and by baseline malnutrition The nal section concludes, and provides specic examples of how the results of the study can be used to bound the preferences over benet/cost ratios required to justify each program. 2 Study Design 2.1 Description of Interventions TheGikuriroprogramwasdevelopedbyUSAID,CatholicReliefServices(CRS),andtheNether- lands Development Organization (SNV) to combat food insecurity among pregnant women and children, particularly during the critical rst 1,000 days of life that play such a dominant role in later-life outcomes and cognition (Figlio et al., 2014). The resulting multi-faceted program brings together several components in order to attack this problem from multiple directions at once, and is a central pillar of the Government of Rwanda's approach to combatting malnutrition in rural 7Rwanda.7Gikuriro combines an integrated nutrition program with a standard WASH curriculum (water, sanitation, and hygiene), and seeks to build the capacity of the health infrastructure pro- viding services to mothers and newborns, particularly Community Health Workers (CHWs). The program also seeks to build livelihoods by providing additional assistance to eligible households, including (a) Village Nutrition Schools (VNS); (b) Farmer eld learning schools (FFLS), which po- tentially includes distribution of small livestock, fortied seed, etc.; (c) Savings and Internal Lend- ing Communities (SILCs); and (d) the Government of Rwanda's Community-Based Environmental Health Promotion Program (CBEHPP). In addition, Gikuriro provided a program of Behavioral Change Communication (BCC), supporting participation in all components of the program includ- ing savings, agriculture, and nutrition, as well as hygiene. This comprehensive approach seeks to build supply and demand for child health services simultaneously, and is fairly typical of the kinds of multi-sectoral child health programs implemented by USAID in many parts of the developing world.8 To benchmark the impact of this program against cash we worked with GiveDirectly, a US-based 501(c)3Non-Protorganization. GiveDirectlyspecializesinsendingmobilemoneytransfersdirectly to the mobile phones of beneciary households to provide large-scale household grants in develop- ing countries including Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. GiveDirectly's typical model has involved targeting households using mass-scale proxy targeting criteria such as roof quality. GiveDirectly builds an in-country infrastructure that allows them to enroll and make transfers to households while simultaneously validating via calls from a phone bank that transfers have been received by the correct people and in a timely manner. Their typical transfers are large and lump-sum, on the order of $1,000, and the organization provides a programatically relevant counterfactual to standard development aid programs because it has a scalable business model that would in fact be capable of providing transfers to the tens of thousands of households that are served by the Gikuriro pro- gram. Because of the nutritional focus of the Gikuriro intervention, GiveDirectly incorporated a 'nudge' into the way the program was introduced (Benhassine et al., 2015), utilizing a low-cost 7USAID's Global Health and Nutrition Strategy explicitly calls for multi-sectoral interventions that incorporate agriculture, WASH, education, and outreach to mothers in the rst 1,000 days through the public health system. The agency reports reaching 27 million children worldwide under the age of 5 in 2016 alone through such programs, which represent the prescribed USAID modality for Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) countries. 8Examples of similar integrated WASH/agriculture/child nutrition programs funded by USAID include SPRING in Bangladesh, RING in Ghana, Yaajende in Senegal, and ENGINE in Ethiopia. 8flyer emphasizing the importance of child nutrition that was given to households at the time of the intervention. An English translation of this flyer is included in Appendix A. Given observed impacts of cash transfers on other goods, e.g., productive assets and housing value, it is evident that households felt at liberty to spend the grants on items not directly related to child nutrition. Rwanda may be a particularly interesting environment in which to pose the benchmarking ques- tion for several reasons. First, child malnutrition rates overall are high\u2014the prevalence of stunting among children under age ve in the 2014-15 Demographic and Health Survey was 37.9 percent, underweight 9.3 percent and wasted 2.2 percent\u2014though this represents an improvement in recent years (DHS, 2016) Second, Rwanda is a country notable in Africa for its bureaucratic competence and the public health infrastructure has been successful in delivering substantial improvements in child and maternal health outcomes (NISR, 2015) through schemes such as Pay-for-Performance (Basinga et al., 2011). Hence, it may provide a relatively strong case in terms of interventions such as Gikuriro that are led through the public health system and lean heavily on Community Health Workers (CHWs). Third, the Government of Rwanda has been experimenting extensively with cash transfer programs over the past few years, such as the inclusion of cash in the flagship Umurenge poverty reduction program (Gahamanyi and Kettlewell, 2015), the $50 million 'Cash-to-poor' pro- gram supported by the World Bank, as well as a number of eorts to transition the support systems for the country's large population of refugees to cash transfers (such as a World Food Programme (WFP) program that is now supporting 15,000 refugees in Gihembe Camp using cash rather than traditional in-kind aid mechanisms (Taylor et al., 2016)). Hence there should be the bureaucratic capacity to implement Gikuriro well, and there is both experience with and interest in cash transfers as a safety net modality in the country.9 Gikuriro is in the midst of a full-scale rollout in 8 districts, and the randomized study design was based on delaying implementation of the program in a number of eligible villages for one year. For this reason the study is only able to measure impacts over the course of the 13 months from baseline to endline, which capture 12 months of on-the-ground implementation for GD and 8-9 months for Gikuriro. We cannot therefore speak to the long-term impacts of the interventions. Anticipating this issue, we took two approaches to measurement. One of them was to try capture the stocks 9Given the framing provided by GiveDirectly and the unusually strong degree of social control exerted by local ocials in the Rwandan context, it is certainly possible that our 'unconditional' transfers have been more forcibly devoted to child consumption than they would have been in a dierent context. 9of intertemporal assets that would be the obvious conduits to future consumption benets for the households. The second was to emphasize outcomes such as dietary diversity and anemia that have the potential to respond quickly to changes in consumption patterns, while also retaining the more standard metrics of child malnutrition such as height for age (HAZ), weight for age (WAZ), and mid- upper arm circumference (MUAC).10Further, a number of recent RCTs have shown that programs can have meaningful impacts on biometric outcomes over timeframes similar to that analyzed in this study, such as Desai et al. (2015), Leroy et al. (2016), Fink et al. (2017), and Null et al. (2018). 2.2 Eligibility for the Study The study aims to compare nutrition and health gains among poor households with young children across the two programs and a control. We therefore used a denition of eligibility tailored to Gikuriro's stated target population: namely, households that contained malnourished children, or pregnant and lactating mothers. A core challenge of the benchmarking endeavor is the need to use a measure of eligibility in a manner that can be dened identically across arms.11As a result, we established a set of 'hard' eligibility criteria on the basis of which beneciaries would be selected and the survey would be stratied. Households meeting these criteria would be identied by the survey rm, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), prior to sampling for the baseline study, to establish a comparable population of eligible households in all arms\u2014including control\u2014of the study. CRS and USAID agreed that the following criteria represent the target population for Gikuriro: \u000fCriteria 1. All households in a village with a malnourished child (dened by a threshold value of weight/age) were enrolled. -Weight/age is used because it is believed that this data is more consistently available than data on middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and height/age, and because it is used by CHWs as a basis for referring children to their local Health Centers. -Thethresholdweight/agevalueforinclusionwasdeterminedusingtheRwandanMinistry of Health standards for malnutrition. The data used to identify eligibles was based on 10Dietary diversity is an immediate indicator of improvements in consumption, and the clinical literature has shown that anemia tests respond within 3 months of improvements in diet (Habicht and Pelletier, 1990). 11We did not intend the scope of the benchmarking exercise to include the implementers' (potentially dierent) ability to cost-eectively identify this target population, so as to maintain the interpretation of impacts as being dierential impacts on a consistently dened beneciary group. 10the Community Health Worker data from Growth Monitoring and Promotion visits. \u000fCriteria 2. All households in Ubudehe 1 or 2 with children under the age of 5 (Ubudehe is the Rwandan government household-level poverty classication, with 1 being the poorest, 3 being non-poor, and rural areas containing very few of the wealthiest Ubudehe 4 households). \u000fCriteria 3. All households in Ubudehe 1 or 2 with a pregnant or lactating mother. Both implementers agreed to attempt to treat all eligible households that were identied as meeting any of these criteria. CRS anticipated an average of 30 eligible households per village, and in principle had established a rationing rule in case that number was exceeded. As will be described below, the number of households per village that could be identied by the survey rm as meeting these targets turned out to be substantially lower. We did not try to impose restrictions on how Gikuriro would target outside of the households identied by the survey rm to be eligible. WeaskedIPAtoidentifytheuniverseofhouseholdsthattheycouldlocatewhometthesecriteria, using three sources. First, CHW records from the national 'Growth Monitoring and Promotion' exercise, which is intended to provide monthly height and weight measurements for all children under two and annual measurements for all children under ve; second, government (census) records of household Ubudehe classications; and nally local health facility information, which provides an alternative data point on children's nutritional status.12Children were dened as malnourished if they had at least one measurement that met government thresholds for malnourishment denitions in the past year, and households were dened as eligible if they had any individual meeting the criteria above. In each village we recorded the number of households in each stratum and sampled up to eight eligibles and four ineligibles for inclusion in the study. Throughout this document we use the words 'eligible' and 'ingeligible' to refer to the classication made by the survey rm at baseline. While the primary analysis focuses on outcomes in the eligible group, we randomly sampled ineligibles into the survey so as to be able to consider broader Total Causal Eects (TCEs). Impacts among ineligibles may arise either because the implementers treated some households outside of the IPA-dened eligible group, or because of spillovers from beneciary to non-beneciary households. 12In practice, most children attending local clinics are referred by a CHW and so are also recorded as malnourished in the Growth Monitoring process. 11The primary analysis is weighted to be representative of all eligible households in study villages, and the analysis including ineligibles is weighted to be representative of all households in study villages. Eligibility lists were shared with both implementers at the same time in the same way, but the sampling of eligible and eligible households for the survey was not revealed to implementers, so as to avoid the possibility that the implementers would specically target the research sample. Our sample of ineligible households lets us understand both how treatment across the implementers may have varied in this ineligible sample, as well as the nature of the impacts observed in this group.Both implementers concurred closely with our denition of treatment on the ground, and compliance was high: we have 90.9 percent of the survey-dened eligibles treated by Gikuriro, and 96.9 percent of the eligibles treated by GiveDirectly.13This means that the Intention-to-Treat eects estimated on the eligibles should be well powered and are close to providing the Average Treatment Eect within this group. We did not however encounter the number of eligible households anticipated; despite having expanded the eligibility criteria beyond what was originally envisioned, we nonetheless found an average of only 13.9 eligible households per village using the hard targeting information. Some villages did not even contain the 8 eligible households we intended to sample and hence we end up with fewer eligibles than 8 in smaller or wealthier villages. On average we have 7.23 eligible households and 4.01 ineligible households sampled per village. When Gikuriro began their actual program implementation, they continued their standard con- sultative process for beneciary identication, which included the use of soft targeting information not available to IPA. Using this additional, richer information set to target, they identied and treated an average of 25.8 households in study villages in Kayonza district, and 26.97 in Nyabihu. Since our rst tranche of GiveDirectly treatments were only among IPA-dened eligible households, we found ourselves with a substantial discrepency in the intensity of treatment across implementers. We responded to this asymmetry by drawing in an additional sample of the poorest ineligible house- holds in GiveDirectly villages to receive household grants so as to maintain parity in village-level 13Because eligible was determined from records rather than from face-to-face visits, it was possible that some identied households were not in fact resident in the village, or that the individuals whose presence made a household eligible had moved out. These were the only reasons that GiveDirectly did not treat a household, and it should be noted that households rejected for the former reason would also not appear in the study sample. In addition, CRS implemented a 'consultative' process with community members and determined that ocial Ubudehe status was incorrect or outdated for some IPA-determined eligible households. 12treatment intensity. One month after baseline we sampled from within the broader set of ineligi- ble Ubudehe 1 and 2 households (e.g. without young children) and passed this additional list to GiveDirectly to be treated with household grants. We already knew the realized treatment intensity from CRS at the time we drew in this additional 'top-up' sample, and so we selected the fraction of ineligibles to be treated by GD such that the realized fraction of households treated per village was identical for Gikuriro and CRS within each district. Given the treatment of the entire eligible stra- tum by GD, we gave them top-up lists that brought in an additional 11.26 households in Kayonza and 12.56 households in Nyabihu during tranche 2. The top-up lists were presented in a randomized order with instructions that GD should replace any non-complying households with the next one on the list to get as close as possible to the assigned number of treated households in Tranche 2. In the end, although the targeting of ineligibles will dier across implementers, the treatment intensities across the two arms are therefore identical by construction. 2.3 Design of the Experiment Randomization occurred at the village level across 248 villages, using a blocked randomization where the blocks were formed by the combination of districts and village-level poverty scores within district, creating a total of 22 blocks with between 10 and 13 villages per block. Fixed eects for these blocks are included in all analysis. A computer was used by the researchers to conduct the randomization based on a frame of villages agreed to by CRS and government ocials. Table 1 presents a schematic of the design of the study. 74 villages were assigned to the Gikuriro intervention, 74 were assigned to the control group (no intervention), and 100 were as- signed to GiveDirectly household grants. The GiveDirectly villages were further split into four transfer amounts, randomized at the village level. Three treatment amount arms, with 22 villages in each, received transfer amounts in a range around the anticipated cost of Gikuriro. A nal 34 villages were assigned to the 'large' GiveDirectly transfer amount which was selected by GiveDi- rectly as the amount anticipated to maximize the cost eectiveness of cash. The transfers actually received by households in the GD 'small' arms (not inclusive of overhead) were $41.32, $83.63, and $116.91. Then, the large transfer amount selected to optimize GiveDirectly's benet/cost ratio was $532 actually transferred to households. All transfer amounts were translated into Rwandan Francs at an exchange rate of 790 RwF per US dollar, and were rounded to the nearest hundred. 13Subject to the constraint of maintaining the assigned average household transfer value at the village level, GiveDirectly believed that most cost-eective use of these funds would be to attempt to equalize the amount transferred per household member, rather than to have households of very dierent sizes receiving the same transfer amount. To accomplish this, we scaled the transfer amounts within a village by household size, such that larger households received larger transfers, but leaving the mean transfer amount at the village level unaected. This formula rst calculated the per-capita transfer for a village using household sizes and the desired average household transfer value. Second, it scaled household-level transfer amounts with household size, applying a minimum of 3 members and a maximum of 8 members, so as to achieve the intended mean transfer amount per householdpervillage. Householdsizesforscalingtransferamountswerederivedfromadministrative data (Community Health Worker reports), and not from baseline surveys. Figure 1 provides a box and whisker plot of the randomly assigned mean transfer amount per village relative to the actual amount received per household observed in the GD institutional data, and shows that the two correspond closely. Within the GD arm we conducted a number of additional, individual-level experiments. 1. Transfer Timing. Evidence from other contexts suggests that a regular, monthly flow of transfers is likely to be a more eective way of delivering the kinds of nutrition and health outcomes that are the target of Gikuriro, rather than large lump-sum transfers (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016). We randomized eligible beneciaries in the household grants arm of the study to three groups designed to measure the eect of frequency: flow transfers divided into a sequence of monthly transfers; lump-sum transfers given all up front; and a choice arm that could decide which of these two modalities they wanted. 2. Choice experiment. The modality for the choice experiment, conducted only in the GD arm, is as follows: (a) First, all respondents were given a menu illustrating the choice between a single lump- sum transfer delivered in any of the 12 months from August 2016 to July 2017 and a flow of monthly payments totaling the same amount. The choice was recorded for each month for each household. (b) Then, the household was randomized to one of three conditions: 14i. with 5/8 probability, they were assigned to the monthly flow treatment. ii. with 1/4th probability, they were assigned to the lump sum treatment. iii. with 1/8th probability, they were assigned to the choice arm. (c) The large majority of the choice arm were given whichever they chose of the Lump Sum versus Flow treatment in the rst month. 1 out of 20 individuals in the choice arm were given their choice in a randomly selected month so as to preserve the incentivization of the monthly choice questions. 2.4 Study Outcomes Primary Outcomes . The study focuses on ve dimensions. Here we briefly summarize each; details of the construction of these outcomes are included in Appendix A. 1. Household monthly consumption per capita (inverse hyperbolic sine\u2014henceforth IHS\u2014to deal with skewness). 2. Household Dietary Diversity, measured using hte WHO standard Household Dietary Diversity Score. 3. Anemia: measured with a biomarker test following DHS protocols at endline only. 4. Child growth and development: measured using in height-for-age, weight-for-age and Mid Upper Arm Circumference at baseline and endline for children under the age of 6 in eligible households. 5. Value of household non-land net wealth. This outcome is the sum of productive and consump- tion assets; the value of the household's dwelling, if owned; and the value of the stock of net savings, less the stock of debt (IHS). Secondary Outcomes . Three types of outcomes are selected to be secondary: proximate outcomes of one or both interventions that do not have an intrinsic welfare interpretation (such as borrowing and saving stocks); outcomes that have welfare weight but are not within the causal chain of both programs (such as investments in health-seeking behavior, which Gikuriro seeks to impact, or housing quality, which has been identied as a dimension of benet in prior evaluations 15of GiveDirectly (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016)); or outcomes of common interest on which power is limited (such as disease burden and mortality). 1. Stock of borrowing and stock of savings (IHS). 2. Birth outcomes: the likelihood of pregnancy and likelihood of live birth within 12 months prior to endline. 3. Health knowledge and sanitation practices. 4. Disease burden and mortality. Mortality is measured as the likelihood that an individual member of the household from baseline has died prior to endline. Disease burden is measured as the prevalence of fever, fever with diarrhea or vomiting, or coughing with blood at endline, 5. Health-seeking behavior/preventative care. We focus on the share of pregnancies resulting in births in medical facilities, the share of children under two years of age with at least one vaccination in the prior year, and the share of children under two years of age with a complete dose of vaccines. 6. Household productive assets (IHS). 7. Housing quality. Two measures are used: the self-reported replacement cost of the current dwelling (irrespective of ownership status, IHS), and an index of housing construction quality, constructed from measures of wall and roof materials and from the number of rooms in the dwelling. The inverse hyperbolic sine is commonly used in analysis of outcomes such as consumption, savings, and asset values that tend to be highly right-skewed and also to contain zeros. The IHS transfor- mation preserves the interpretation of a log (meaning that impacts can be interpreted as percent changes) but does not drop zeros. Only outcomes that we expected to be skewed were pre-registered to be analyzed using IHS. All non-binary outcomes are also Winsorized at the 1 percent and 99 percent level (values above the 99th percentile are overwritten with the value at the 99th percentile to reduce skewness and increase statistical power). Because we restrict the analysis in this paper to the pre-specied primary and secondary outcomes only, we do not correct the results for multiple inference (Anderson, 2008). 162.5 Regression Specications The data from the study are analyzed following our pre-analysis plan, consistent with the design being a three-armed, cluster randomized trial. Let the subscript iindicate the individual, cthe cluster (village), and bthe randomization block. Eicbis an Foroutcomesobservedbothatbaseline (Yicb1)andatendline (Yicb2),weconduct ANCOVA analysis including the baseline outcome; otherwise we omit the baseline outcome and run a simple post-treatment cross-sectional regression. Fixed eects for the village-level assignment blocks within which the randomization was conducted bare included, as well as a set of baseline control variables selected from the baseline data on the basis of their ability to predict the primary outcomes, denoted by Xicb1. In our simple experimental analysis we include two distinct dummies forGDtreatment; oneforthethreesmalleramounts TGDS cchosentobeclosetothecostofGikuriro, and one for the 'large' transfer amount TGDL c, whose impact is not cost comparable to any of the other treatments. Thus the regressions to estimate the Intention to Treat Eect among eligibles + Xicb1+\u001aYicb1+\u000ficb28i:Eicb= 1(1) Standard errors are clustered at the village level to reflect the design eect in the study (Athey and Imbens, 2017). The block-level xed eects are be included to account for the block-randomization of the study (blocks are dened by district/sector and village-level poverty rankings, there are 22 blocks in the study). Following the 'post-double-LASSO' procedure of Belloni et al. (2014b), a set of covariates were selected using a LASSO algorithm on the control data as described in our pre-analysis plan; this model selection procedure is detailed, together with the resulting set of baseline covariates for each primary and secondary outcome, in Appendix Section B. This regression includes sample weights equal to the number of eligible households in the village divided by the number of eligible households in the study in that village, so as to make the results representative of all eligible households in study villages. For outcomes such as anemia that are collected at endline only, we cannot include the lagged outcome to run the ANCOVA regression, and so use the simple cross-sectional analog to Equation (1). 17The Total Causal Eect of the program on the average household in study villages can be estimated by running Equation (1) on the entire sample, ineligible and eligible alike. For this regression, the weights on the ineligible households equal the number of ineligible households in the village divided by the number of ineligible households in the sample in that village, so as to make the results representative of all households in study villages. Following our pre-analysis plan, we have a regression adjustment strategy for analyzing the programs at an exactly cost-equivalent level using the ex-post costing data from both programs. First, begin with the total GD donor cost per eligible within each transfer amount arm, denoted by tc. Subtract from this number the benchmarked Gikuriro cost per household Cdescribed above, and denote the dierence tc\u0000C= c; this is the deviation (positive or negative) of each GD arm from the benchmarked Gikuriro cost. Set cto zero in the control and Gikuriro arms. We can then re-run regression (1) above controlling for a linear term in c, a dummy for either treatment, and a dummy for receiving Gikuriro. Because absorbs the deviation of the GD arm from the benchmarked Gikuriro cost, the dummy coecient on Gikuriro treatment will serve as an intercept measuring the impact of Gikuriro benchmarked an exactly donor cost-equivalent cash transfer. So, we have: Yicb2= b+\u000eTTc+\u000eGKTGK c + Xicb1+\u001aYicb1+ 1 c+\u000ficb28I:Eicb= 1 (2) In this specication Tcis a dummy variable indicating any treatment (Gikuriro or GD). Subject to the assumption of linear transfer amount eects, the slope coecient ccaptures impacts arising from deviations in GD cost from Gikuriro cost, the coecient \u000eTeectively gives the impact of GD at the cost of Gikuriro), and the dummy variable \u000eGKprovides a direct benchmarking test: the dierential impact of Gikuriro over GD at the same cost per eligible. Per the pre-analysis plan, we impose the simple linear functional form to preserve as much statistical power as possible for the core cost-equivalent benchmarking comparison, although it is straightforward to make this more flexible.14 The Total Causal Eect can also be benchmarked at a cost-equivalent level. The methodology is very similar; we redene cas the deviation of GD spending per household in the overall village, 14Because in this study we have three very similar small transfer amounts and one much larger amount we have little ability to measure non-linear impacts of the transfer amount. 18relative to the Gikuriro cost dened in the same way. By then cost-adjusting an estimate of the TCE weighted to be representative of all households in the village, we can measure how the overall village-level average impact of each program diers when spending per household is the same. 2.6 Cost Equivalence, Before and After the Fact The costing exercise in the study utilized the 'ingredients method' which species all the ingre- dients (resources and inputs) used in performing the activities that produce the key outcomes of interest. In this costing, cost is dened as opportunity cost: the value of a good or service in its best alternative use. When a good or service is used for a specic purpose, the user \"gives up\" the possibility of employing it in another application (see Dhaliwal and Tulloch, 2012; Levin and McEwan, 2001, for more discussion). The policy question is asked from the perspective of the donor (in this case, USAID): the policy objective is to achieve the highest benet-cost ratio per intended beneciary for each dollar that is spent on a program. Overhead expenditures in the implementation chain are an inherent part of these costs, and so the lower transactions costs in getting mobile money to the beneciary play an important role in their potential attractiveness. We conducted two dierent costing exercises at two moments in time. The ex-ante exercise, which was based on projected budgets and stang costs, was used to predict the cost at the time of the study design, and to choose the ranges over which the lower GiveDirectly transfer amounts would be randomized. Then, a rigorous ex-post costing exercise was conducted for both programs after the fact using actual expenditures. Since the Gikuriro program covers eight districts (e.g. much larger than the study population only) we attempt to cost the full national program (not just the study sample), inclusive of all direct costs, all indirect in-country management costs including transport, real estate, utilities, and the stang required to manage the program, and all international overhead costs entailed in managing the Gikuriro program. Beneciary identication costs, incurred by the survey rm and identical across all arms of the study, are excluded from the cost-benet calculation. Monitoring and Evaluation costs, similarly, were excluded so as to be costing only the implementation component. All administrative costs, including the appropriate share of the costs of maintaining international headquarters infrastructure, were included in the costing. Because we do not want dierences in scale to drive dierential costs per beneciary, we asked GiveDirectly to articially scale up their 19operations and provide us with numbers reflecting the costs per beneciary if they were running a national-scale program across eight districts, including 56,127 beneciary households like Gikuriro. This is the relevant question for a USAID program ocer contemplating commissioning a program to move the outcomes studied at comparable scale. WecostedeachGDarmseparately, askingwhattheoverheadratewouldhavebeenifGDhadrun a national program at the scale of Gikuriro giving only transfers of that amount. Overhead costs as a percentage of the amount transferred decline sharply with transfer amount for GD because xed costs represent a large share of their total overhead. This allows us to conduct the benet/cost comparisons 'at scale', rather than having the articial, multi-amount environment of the study contaminate the costing exercise across arms. Another important issue in costing is compliance. Our study impacts focus on the ITT, and the costing number that matches this estimand is the amount spent per eligiblehousehold, rather than perbeneciary household. We can incorporate non-compliance into the eective amount spent by each implementer per study household by dierentiating costs of two types: rst there are 'averted' costs, which are not spent on a household if they do not comply with treatment; second there are 'non-averted' costs which will be expended whether or not the household complies. For GiveDirectly all variable costs are averted, for Gikuriro all variable costs except for the village-level behavior change component are averted. Using this approach we can recover a cost-equivalent comparison even if the compliance rates are dierent across arms. To do this, we match institutional data from Gikuriro and GiveDirectly to the study village and study sample, and calculate compliance rates in both the eligible sample and the overall village population.15 Gikuriro can be broken into two kinds of costs which have dierent numbers of beneciaries. First is the village-level treatments (WASH and BCC) which are applied very broadly to the village population. These costs drive 40 percent of the total cost of the program, and are applied to households whether or not they comply with Gikuriro treatment directly (non-averted). The second are costs that pertain only to households that directly participate in the program; these costs are 15Several details require further description here. First, our pre-analysis plan indicated that we would cost each sub-ingredient of Gikuriro and use survey data to calculate compliance with each ingredient. Costing every ingredient of that program proved infeasible, and in the event households that benet from any one of the direct interventions in Gikuriro are likely to receive them all. So, with the exception of the Behavior Change component (which was provided to the entire village and is costed as such) we cost the two implementers in the same way: the product of cost per beneciary and the compliance rate calculated from institutional data in the relevant population. 20incurred only if the household complies with treatment and averted otherwise, hence we hit these costs with the compliance rates among eligibles and overall to calculate the cost per eligible and cost per household overall. As described in the Introduction, we designed the study around an anticipated Gikuriro cost of $119 per beneciary household, which given the ex-ante costing of GD led us to transfer $41, $84, and $117 dollars to households in those arms. Table2providestheexactcostingnumbersarrivedatbytheex-postexercise. Gikurirotreatment rates are 90.9 percent among eligibles and 19 percent in the population as a whole. Given an actual cost to USAID of $141.84 per beneciary, this gives a cost of $134.13 per eligible household and $72.94 per household in the village. GD faced few refusals for eligible individuals they attempted to treat (0.3 percent), but due to a remit from the government only to treat households in Ubudehe 1 and 2, they declined to treat specic households that IPA dened as eligible if they found the Community Health Worker-provided listing information to be incorrect when they approached them for enrollment (1.6 percent). They were also unable to locate 3.0 percent of surveyed eligible households. TotaltreatmentratesintheGiveDirecltyarmamongeligiblesaretherefore96.9percent, and within the whole population 18.3 percent. Given costs to USAID of $66, $111, $145, and $567 across the GD this costs per eligible of $64, $111, $136, and $555 (compliance rates are calculated separately for each GD arm), and costs per household in the village of $12, $21, $27, and $100. 3 Analysis 3.1 Attrition and Balance of the Experiment Endline outcome measurement is subject to a number of distinct forms of attrition; we start our empiricalanalysisbyconsideringeachoftheseinturn. Themoststraightforwardoftheseisstandard household-level attrition, meaning that a household sampled into the baseline survey attrited from the endline survey. In Table 3, we see that overall rates of attrition at the household level were low, around 3.3 percent in the control. We see the pattern typical in RCT studies where attrition is somewhat lower in the treatment groups (where both ongoing contact and a sense of reciprocity may keep individuals in the endline), but these dierentials are small, from 0.89 percentage point in the GD 'small' arm to 1.7 percentage point in the GD 'large' arm; only the latter is signicant, and 21only at the 10 percent level. Looking at the other covariates of attrition in column 2 we see that attriters and non-attriting households are similar. Hence we conclude that household-level attrition is unlikely to be a source of bias in the study. When we turn to the analysis of individual-level outcomes in Panel B the picture is more complex, because many of the primary and secondary outcomes are only measured for certain types of individuals (anthropometrics for children, birth outcomes only for those pregnant). Each of these forms of missingness may be driven by the treatments, so attrition for each type of outcome must be taken in turn. We present a basic analysis of attrition here, and return to a discussion of this issue when we show treatment eects on fertility and mortality. We analyze in Panel B four types of dierential missingness that may occur. First, we compare the attrition of all household members from the roster in the household survey; both the rates and the dierentials here are very similar to the household attrition problem suggesting that there has been little additional dierential attrition of individuals. Next we examine the anthropometric panel, whereby all children under 6 at baseline who were given anthropometrics at the baseline should have been followed up with at endline. Here the absolute rates of attrition are a little more than double what they are for individuals overall, presumably because of the greater diculty of nding and measuring children for this exercise. More concerningly, the decline in attrition in the treatment groups now becomes strongly signicant, particularly for Gikuriro villages (perhaps evidence of the superior monitoring of malnourished children taking place in those villages). Given this signicance, we follow our Pre-Analysis Plan in also presenting results for the anthropometric impacts that are corrected by inverse propensity weights to correct for the observable determinants of selection. Third, we examine whether individuals who should have been anemia tested in the followup were; here we see no evidence of dierential attrition across arms. Finally, we examine the likehood that a new household member appears (typically due to births subsequent to baseline), and nd no signicant dierences. Overall, then, dierential selection across treatment arms is not a major problem for study outcomes other than anthropometrics. We return to the issue of unequal attrition in anthropometrics in the following section. In Table 4 we present the comparison of baseline outcomes and control variables for eligibles at both the individual and household level, using the unattrited panel sample that will be the basis of the evaluation. The regressions used here mimic as closely as possible the impact regressions, using 22xed eects for randomization blocks, including a battery of baseline control variables, weighting to make the sample representative of all eligibles, and clustering standard errors at the village level to account for the design eect. At the household level the experiment is generally well balanced; we present 33 comparisons in this table and nd four of them to be signicant at the 10 percent level, much as we would expect. In Panel B we present all of the individual-level primary and secondary outcomes that are observed at baseline, and again nd the experiment to be very well-balanced with only two outcomes of 27 signicant at the 10 percent level. Unfortunately the only individual imbalance signicant at the 5 percent level is in one of the core study outcomes; weight for age. The anthropometric indicators generally appear superior at baseline in the GD Large arm, an issue to which we return in the discussion of our results where we focus on the ANCOVA analysis to deal with this issue. Overall, the experiment is well-balanced at baseline. 3.2 Basic Experimental Results on Eligibles Table 5 presents the core results of the study on the eligible population. Panel A shows household-level impacts on the panel sample, and Panel B presents impacts on the individual- level primary and secondary outcomes, where the relevant sample is outcome-specic and follows the Pre-Analysis Plan. Taking the Gikuriro treatment rst, we see impacts on a set of proximate and directly targeted outcomes of the program components. Household savings increases by a massive 109 percent (con- sistent with the creation of SILCs). Dietary diversity, anthropometrics, and maternal anemia all move in the right direction but none of these changes is signicant. No consistent impacts appear for consumption and wealth outcomes, or for health knowledge and sanitation practices. Hence the program has been successful in moving an indicator closely related to one of its sub-components, but at least within the timeframe of the study these changes in savings have not yet translated into signcant improvements in the anthropometric child outcomes. We turn next to to the impact of the three smaller GiveDirectly arms whose average cost is $111, 78 percent of the cost of Gikuriro. Here, we see quite a dierent set of outcomes move. Instead of increasing savings, small GD transfers lead to a 76 percent paydown of debt, and an increase in the value of productive and consumption assets, by 26 percent and 37 percent respectively. A number of surpring negative results also emerge; we nd a small deterioration in household wealth 23and home values, and some of the child biometric measures move in the wrong direction.16Thus far, then, the comparison of Gikuriro to cash breaks down into two distinct dimensions of improvement, each of which has a dierent and entirely plausible pathway to long-term improvements: savings (Gikuriro), or debt reduction and asset investment (GiveDirectly). When we examine the third row, however, a more transformative impact arising from of the 'large' cash transfer is clearly apparent. Not only do omnibus measures of consumption and wealth go up across the board, but metrics of consumption closely linked to child health improve. The dietary diversity score increases by 15 percent o a base of 4.16. Productive assets increase by 76 percent, consumer assets almost double in value, and home value increases substantially. In the individual outcomes the benets of this surge in consumption are evident as well; within the course of one year we see a 0.091 SD improvement in HAZ, a 0.067 SD improvement in WAZ, and a 0.13 SD improvement in MUAC, all signicant at least at the 10 percent level.17. The ANCOVA specication should be particularly important in the analysis of the anthropometric indicators that showed signs of imbalance at baseline; indeed if we examine these outcomes in post-treatment levels we see substantially stronger apparent treatment eects. Anemia falls slightly (not signicant), and there is a substantial decrease in child mortality of almost 1 percentage point(or 70 percent o of the baseline value). To contextualize these eects using unweighted numbers, the control group eligibles saw 13 cases of child mortality out of 2,596 children (0.5 percent) while the GD Large arm saw 2 cases out of 1,200 children (0.16 percent). Hence the GD Large arm saw meaningful improvements in consumption and child health. At the bottom of this table we provide the t-statistics on an F-test that the ratio of the benets across the GD large and small arm diers from the ratio of their costs (5.01 to 1). This statistic asks whether we can say that the impact scale in a manner dierent to the costs; only in the case of debt reduction (where small transfers have a big eect and big transfers do not) and house quality (where small transfers have a engative and large transfers a positive eect) can we reject cost-symmetric benet scaling for cash transfers. Before taking the individual-level impacts at face value, it is important to recognize that most of 16The pattern here would be consistent with the theoretical insight presented in (Duflo et al., 2013), where a new opportunity to invest in productive assets can cause a 'piling in' of other sources of liquidity in the household, meaning that individuals may choose to consume less or buy fewer consumer durables during the investment phase. 17These improvements should be viewed against the backdrop of a sharp deterioration in anthropometrics subse- quent to birth that typically occurs in LDCs, leaving rural African children often two full SDs below the international norm by age 3 (Shrimpton et al., 2001), (Victora et al., 2010). 24the endline outcomes are only observed for in potentially endogenously selected (surviving children, women who had children during the study, etc.). If the treatments led to substantial changes in fertility or mortality patterns, then the average outcome among surviving children or mothers is subject to both extensive and an intensive margin drivers, and cannot be interpreted simply as a ceteris paribus impact on a given baseline individual (see Baird et al. (2016) for more discussion of this issue). In this sense the lack of impacts on pregnancy rates, and the small absolute value of the impacts on live births and mortality, suggest that shifts in the composition of living children are unlikely to be large drivers of the treatment/control dierentials. It therefore appears very unlikely that dierential patterns of fertility or mortality in response to the treatments are leading to large shifts in the composition of surviving children or mothers across arms, and hence we can interpret these impacts in a standard way. One of the most fundamental results in theoretical development economics is that poor house- holds should have a single 'shadow value' of cash which pulls down investment in all capital-hungry endeavors in a symmetric way. The above ndings are generally consistent with this view of the world, as an intervention that relaxes credit constraints leads to shifts in consumption patterns that are very broadly spread across domains. This property means that small cash transfers are hard to detect because they move too many outcomes by too small an amount to be signicant, while large cash transfers result in a broad-based increase in consumption in many dimensions. Our pre-analysis plan states that for any outcomes where we nd dierential attrition, we would estimate a propensity to remain in the sample incorporating covariates, dummies for treatments, and their interactions on the right-hand side, and then re-weight the analysis by the product of the inverse of this probability and the standard sampling weight. This procedure corrects the impacts for the observable determinants of attrition, and uses regression weighting to attempt to make the treatment and control samples comparable on important covariates even after attrition. Because we primarily found signicantly dierential attrition for the anthropometric outcomes, in Table IPW we present the results of this correction. We interact with each treatment dummy the same right- hand side covariates we use the same controls in the anthropometric regressions: gender, a linear, quadratic, and cubic for age in months, baseline household wealth, and a dummy for membership in Ubudehe poverty category 1. The rst three columns show the standard results, as in the previous table, and the next three show the corrected estimates. The results are virtually identical, indicating 25that the types of children who attrited from the study are similar across arms and hence dierential attrition is unlikely to be driving our impacts. 3.3 Cost-Equivalent Benchmarking The core purpose of the comparative experiment conducted is to exploit the randomized vari- ation in transfer amounts to conduct an exact cost-equivalent benchmarking exercise. Using the costing numbers emerging from the ex-post exercise, we use the observed costs, overhead rates, and compliance rates to calculate the donor cost per eligible household in each arm of the study. Using Equation 3 from Section 3.1, we can control for 'any treatment', for the monetary deviation of the cash transfer arm amount from the ex-post Gikuriro cost, and then the inclusion of a dummy for 'Gikuriro treatment' will test the dierential impact of Gikuriro over GD at precisely the same ex-post donor cost (subject to the assumption of linearity implicit in this formulation). A graphical representation of our strategy is provided in Figure 2, which plots the IHS of savings on the y-axis for all four GD treatment amounts (black circles), for GK (gray diamond), and the control (white circle). The line represents the tted average savings by GD transfer amount, and by predicting the outcome on this line at the exact cost of Gikuriro (gray triangle), the benchmarked dierential is then the vertical dierence between the Gikuriro impact and the projected cost-equivalent GD impact. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 7. Starting with the third row rst, we have a direct estimate of the marginal eect of an additional 100 dollars in donor cost via cash transfers the primary and secondary outcomes.18As could be inferred from previous tables, this coecient is strongly signicant across a wide range of outcomes, particularly those most related to household consumption. An extra 100 dollars leads to a 5.6 percent increase in consumption, a 7.7 percent increaseindietarydiversity, a17percentincreaseinsavings, an11percentand12percentincreasein productive and consumption assets, respectively, and leads housing value to improve by 4.6 percent and the index of housing quality to increase by 0.1 SD. In terms of anthropometrics, the change in value of transfer is signicant only for height-for-age (where small transfers had a slight depressive eect). An extra $100 per beneciary household\u2014with eligible households containing an average 18While GiveDirectly does of course have xed costs, nearly all of the marginal increase in transfer value to a xed population of recipients is received by the beneciary: of the USD 421 increase from the upper cost-equivalent transfer and the GD-large transfer, USD 415.09 was received by beneciaries themselves. 26of 2.7 children under the age of six\u2014increases HAZ by 0.022 standard deviations. Comparing a positive and insignicant eect of small transfers and a negative and insignicant eect of large transfers on the rate of live births, the transfer amount slope turns out to be signicantly negative. Beyond this, none of the other individual outcomes respond to transfer amount in a manner that we can reject at 95 percent signicance. With the third row estimating the linear heterogeneity in impacts by transfer size around the cost-equivalent transfer, the second row (dummy for 'any treatment') becomes an intercept term that estimates the impact of cash transfers at a cost equivalent to Gikuriro, although this exact amount was not included in the experiment. Given that the mean transfer amount in the 'small' arm is only slightly lower than the GK cost, this estimate looks generally similar to the second row of table 5 (the simple average experimental eect across the 'small' transfer amounts). At the exact cost of Gikuriro, we estimate that cash transfers would have led to a signicant 73 percent decrease in the stock of debt, and a 30 percent and 40 percent increase in productive and consumption assets, respectively. The rst row of this table contains the heart of the comparative benchmarking exercise. Looking rstatthehouseholdoutcomes, weseethatGikuriroissuperioratdrivingupsavingsbalances, while cash generates more debt reduction, a greater increase in consumption, and a larger accumulation of assets. The dierential eect of the programs on savings and borrowing is interesting, and suggests that while both interventions serve to improve the net stock of liquid wealth (savings net of borrowing), the focused push on SILC groups in Gikuriro drives this more strongly through the vehicle of new savings while households making their own choices are more strongly disposed to reduce debt instead. Which of these strategies makes more sense? A simple comparison of interest rates is revealing. Gikuriro SILCs were free to set their own interest rates, but typically paid about 5 percent per annum nominal. Credit interest rates, by comparison, vary from an average of 22 percentintheMFIsectortoupwardsof60percentininformalcreditmarkets. Giventhat32percent of eligible households reported having both borrowing and savings at baseline (and 79 percent had either borrowing or saving) it seems that the desire to pay down debt might be warranted. Virtuallynoneoftheindividual-leveloutcomesaresignicantlydierentacrosstheinterventions, arising from the fact that both of the inexpensive interventions in this study were ineective at moving child outcomes, and only large cash transfers did this. There are two outcomes signicant 27in the dierential comparisons that are not signicant in either intervention in Table 5, namely sanitation practices and births in facilities (both of which somewhat surprisingly favor GD). We do not emphasize these results because in absolute comparison to the control group both arms are ineective. 3.4 Total Causal Eects Because of the random sampling of ineligibles, we can conduct an analysis representive of the population of study villages by pooling the strata together and using population sampling weights. The average weight in the ineligible sample is 24.4 and in the eligible sample it is 2, meaning that while the unweighted eligible sample is larger, it is the ineligibles who will dominate the weighted sample. Recall that the treatment eects on ineligible households may arise either from the treatment and targeting of the two interventions among ineligible households (with saturations set to be the same at just over 18 percent on average in both arms, but with targeting diering), or from spillovers between eligible and ineligible households. With 11.4 percent of all households being dened as eligible, the treatment rate in the ineligible sample is 8.4 percent. This means that the large majority of the additional sample included in the TCE analysis only receive impacts through spillover eects to untreated households. These impacts, using (1) but including the ineligible sample and using weights to reflect the whole village population, are presented in Table 8. Here, the overall picture is very dierent from the impact among eligibles. For Gikuriro, we see improvements at the 99 percent signcance level in the index of health knowledge, a core component of the program and one which was broadly targeted at the village population by the program (as reflected by our accounting of these costs as 'non-averted'). Vaccinations, presumably provided by government health facilities but not a central focus of Gikuriro, also improve signicantly. So there is some real evidence of holistic benets in health-related domains for the population of Gikuriro villages. These changes, it is true, do not translate into observable improvements in health outcomes for children or adults within the timeframe of the study, but still suggest that Gikuriro implementers have been successful in driving community-level health knowledge. With cash transfers, on the other hand, improvements appear to be more narrowly limited to the beneciaries of the transfers. The 'small' transfers do not change any village-level outcome at 28the 10 percent level. The 'large' transfers, so positive among beneciaries, in general see negative signs across the consumption indicators, lead to a signicant drop in savings at the village level, and are only positively associated with vaccination rates. These results are consistent with GD 'large' transfers having some negative spillover eects on non-beneciaries, such as might be generated by an increase in local consumer prices (consistent with Cunha et al. (forthcoming)) or a decrease in interest rates as transfers are consumed and saved. On net there is little evidence that the widespread benets observed in the eligibles carry over to the broader population of the village when the transfers are targeted at a relatively small fraction of the households. 3.5 Benchmarked Total Causal Eects We can perform a similar cost-equivalent benchmarking exercise for the TCEs, adjusting now by cost per household in the overall village. This allows us to ask how the two programs dier in their impact on households in the village as a whole when the same amount is spent by each program on average. This analysis is presented in table 9. Again beginning with the third row, we see that an increase in transfers of $100 (now to the average household in the village) increases the value of productive assets by a half of a percent. Health knowledge appears to deteriorate with the amount transferred. The cost benchmarked cash transfer in the second row has no impact on household-level variables at the village level, but does improve vaccinations. The core comparative benchmarking exercise in the rst row shows Gikuriro strongly superior at improving health knowledge at the village level. A signicantly larger improvement in dietary diversity under Gikuriro is based on a comparison between two insignicant eects and so again is not emphasized. 3.6 Lump Sum versus Flow Transfers GiveDirectly households were further randomized to Lump Sum, Flow, and Choice treatments. We can set aside the (random) group assigned to choice and begin our analysis of the GD sub- experiments by comparing how receiving money as a lump sum drives dierential impact relative to the same amount of money assigned as a flow. We include separate dummy variables for the impact of the lump sum transfer in the 'small' and 'large' arms, using the flow transfers as the base category in both arms. Our hypothesis for this analysis was that lump sum transfers would be less good at improving outcomes such as nutrition, anthropometrics, and anemia that are based on a 29cumulate flow of consumption over the duration of the study, while the lump sum transfers would be superior in driving large one-time investments such as productive assets and consumer durables. Table 10 shows the results of this analysis. In the 'large' arm we see results that are largely in line with expectations, in that lump sum transfers generate weakly better household wealth and strongly superior value of consumption assets, leading to a doubling of value relative to flow transfers. In the 'small' arm we see a weakly larger pay-down of debt for lump sum transfers, but contrary to expectations housing values are somewhat lower. Overall, we see some conrmation at the superiority of lump-sum transfers in driving xed investment. In the individual outcomes, we also see some conrmation of expectations in that 5 out of 6 estimates of anthropometrics have negative signs on the lump sum interactions, and improvements in MUAC for the 'large' arm were limited to the flow transfers. 3.7 Analysis of Transfer Timing Choice within the GD Arm An intriguing benet of oering a choice of treatment modalities is that individuals might be able to use private information to select a welfare-optimizing treatment in a way that a central targeter could not. While we have relatively low power to examine this question, we can attempt to shed light on the direct benets of choice using our experimental variation. To do this, we evaluate the outcome in the choice arm relative to a counterfactual that would be generated if individuals had no ability to select according to treatment eects and so choose eectively at random, generating an outcome that would be the weighted average of the outcomes of those assigned to lump sum and flow (where weights come from the fraction of the choice arm choosing each alternative). We dene dummy variables for the flow transfer, the lump-sum transfer, and the choice treat- ment. We can run the ANCOVA impact choice than then be tested via an F-test of the hypothesis that \u000eC=\u0016\u000eF+ (1\u0000\u0016)\u000eLS, where\u0016is the fraction of the choice arm that chooses the Flow arm. This tests for the domains in which individuals are able to obtain superior outcomes via choice than would be 30expected given the average outcome that would be expected if they had been assigned to those arms. The results of this exercise are presented in Table 11. This test is based on only 89 eligible panel households assigned to the choice arm, but it nonetheless provides some suprisingly strong evidence in favor of flexibility in cash transfer modality. Dietary diversity, maternal anemia, live births, and births in facilities all not only improve signicantly in the choice arm, but improve signicantly more than would be expected based on the proportionately weighted averages of the lump sum and flow arms. Only health knowledge looks worse with choice. While these results are more speculative due to the small sample size, this suggests that choice itself is generating superior health outcomes relative to an external assignment mechanism. 4 Analysis of Heterogeneity 4.1 Anthropometric eects by baseline malnourishment We hypothesized in the Pre-Analysis Plan that the benets of the treatments in terms of child anthropometrics would be largest for those who began the study most malnourished. To test this, we run a regression with child anthropometrics (HAZ, WAZ, and MUAC) as the outcomes, using the structure of Equation 1 above and controlling for our battery of baseline covariates, a dummy for all three treatments (GK, GD, and GD large), the baseline biometric outcome, and the interaction between the treatments and baseline biometrics. The hypothesis is that the interaction terms will be negative, meaning that the programs are most eective for those who had the worst baseline biometric outcomes. Table 12 the results of this analysis. The interpretation of the impacts in this table are as follows: rows 4-6 give the simple impact of the programs when the interacted term is zero (which, in this case, is at the mean). Rows 1-3 provide a test of the dierential impact of the program across baseline anthropometric measures, so the lack of signicance in these rows means that the impacts are not heterogeneous by nutrition status at baseline. The implication is that the improvement in anthropometrics induced by the GD large treatment were experienced broadly across the baseline distribution of HAZ and WAZ, and were not concentrated among those who began the study most malnourished. 314.2 Anthropometric impacts by child age We can use a similar approach to examine heterogeneity by child age. Given that we have children who start the study outside of the rst 1,000 days (those 2-5 years old at baseline), we might expect that the impact of the program on these more fully developed children would be smaller. Similarly, we can examine the relative impacts of the program for children born during the study to examine the relative benets of newborn/in utero exposure relative to children who were eating solid foods when the program began. Given the impacts on household dietary diversity this latter outcome may be particularly relevant. In Table 13 we run regressions on the eligible sample, allowing treatment interactions with an indicator for child age at endline (we do not use the ANCOVA specication in this regression so as to be able to include children born subsequent to the baseline survey). We include two dierent interactions; one using a dummy for 'rst 1,000 days at baseline', and a second more stringent dummy for 'born since baseline'. The results are presented in Table 13, and are in many ways surprising. Again, rows 4-6 provide the simple eect of the program in the older group (where the interaction term is set to zero) and the rst three rows provide a test of whether the impact is dierential for those in their rst 1000 days (columns 1-3) or for newborns (columns 4-6). The small GD treatment is lesssuccessful for HAZ among children in the rst 1,000 days, and the Gikuriro and large GD treatment eects display no consistent relationship to age. Because of the strong overall impacts of the large GD arm on HAZ, we delve deeper into the heterogeneity of this result. Figure 3 uses a Fan regression to present a non-parametric picture of the GD large treatment eects across the age distribution for HAZ, and Figure 4 presents the same graphic using anemia as the outcome. Both of these gures provide suggestive evidence that larger treatment eects are emerging among the very youngest children who were exposed to the program in utero. This pattern is similar to the medium-term results in Baird et al. (2016), who nd unconditional transfers in Malawi to have the largest eect on children exposed in utero. More speculatively, for both outcomes eects are also signicant again for children in the 2-4 year age range when the program began, who would have been eating solid food, and hence the impacts appear least signicant among children of age to be being breastfed at the time of the intervention. To summarize, treatment eects prove to be relatively homogeneous across both age and base- 32line malnutrition status, although there is a suggestion that children exposed in utero may have benetted the most from the consumption increases seen in the GD Large arm. Given the rela- tively short-term nature of our followup survey, we consider this analysis to illustrate the speed at which the dramatic improvements in consumption and dietary diversity at the household level seen under the GD Large treatment translate into improved biometric outcomes. The longer-term literature has typically found impacts of large cash transfer programs on HAZ in the range of 0.2- 0.45 standard deviations (Aguero et al., 2006; Barham et al., 2014); our results suggest that these measures improve roughly 0.1 standard deviation within a year of the inception of treatment, are all signicant at 10 percent level or above, and are relatively invariant to baseline age or malnutrition. Comparison to the broader literature suggests that these impacts may grow over time. 5 Conclusion This study compares a multi-pronged child nutrition program against cash transfers that have been benchmarked to have equal cost to the donor. We nd that this integrated program was able within 8-9 months to move an important outcome directly generated by a component of its intervention, namely SILC-driven savings, and also to signicantly improve health knowledge at the village level, a core component of the WASH and BCC interventions. The program appears to have improved the trackability of malnourished children in treatment villages. Nonetheless, it did not signicantly shift the core child anthropometric outcomes that these interventions are intended to target, nor child or maternal anemia. An equivalent amount of money provided in the form of a cash transfer led to small increases across many consumption outcomes, and signicantly increased the paydown of debt, as well as production and consumption assets. A much larger cash transfer of over $500 per household delivered comprehensive consumption benets and also moved key health outcomessuchasdietarydiversity, heightandweightforage, andmortality. Theresultsarenuanced in terms of the modality of delivery, the choice of outcome, and the magnitude of transfers. In concluding on the impact of Gikuriro, it is certainly possible that investments in behavior change (such as the substantial village-level improvement in health knowledge) as well as improve- ments in the Community Health Worker system will have longer term impacts that may do more for the population's nutrition over time than even a large cash transfer to a single cohort today. If 33an increasingly capable local health infrastructure can deliver nutrition interventions over the next ten years, then a huge number of future children could benet and their well-being certainly should be part of the policy calculation. However a recent RCT evaluation of the Government of Rwanda's CBEHPP, which is the WASH program implemented under Gikuriro, found that it was not eective at decreasing diarrheal disease (Sinharoy et al., 2017). Given that the Gikuriro bundle which also included direct in-kind transfers of livestock and seed was not found here to improve short-term consumption, these broader institutional impacts would need to be substantial and improving over time if they are lead to large long-term impacts. Therefore while Gikuriro did shift some outcomes closely related to pieces of the intervention, we uncover little evidence that directly conrms the program's theory of change in driving primary child outcomes. Our study design places some limitations on what can be learned. First, the cross-village exper- iment lets us measure the impact of those parts of the Gikuro intervention that are implemented at the village or household level only. Further, the relatively short time frame of the study means that we are measuring impacts over a shorter timeframe than would be ideal, particularly for outcomes such as malnutrition and anthropometrics that may respond slowly to improvements in nutrition. Gikuriro made substantial investments in local capacity around health and sanitation, and this infrastructure may drive future benets in a way not captured in our study. We do however cost both interventions in a manner that reflects only the ingredients to the spatial and temporal scales over which we can measure impacts (cross-village, one year) and hence can cleanly benchmark the benet/cost ratios of these two very dierent interventions over their rst year of operation. We can use our results to make concrete two types of tradeos that policymakers considering counterfactual uses of funds are forced to confront. First, tradeos across outcomes\u2014for a given set of beneciaries\u2014and second, tradeos between larger impacts concentrated among a smaller number of beneciaries and more diuse impacts in a broader swathe of the target population. To illustrate the rst of these margins, consider the a policymaker who values impacts on savings and productive assets; for simplicity of exposition we ignore other dimensions of impact.19Both of these represent investments in the future consumption of the household. When compared with a cost-equivalent cash transfer, Gikuriro has relatively larger eects on savings: a dierential impact 19In general, it is appropriate to ignore dimensions of impact only when either the policymaker places no weight on them, or when there is no diernetial impact of available interventions on these dimensions. 34of 118 percent as shown in Table 7. On the other hand, GiveDirectly's cost-equivalent transfer delivers an impact on the value of productive assets of approximately 30 percent relative to control, and our estimates suggest the impact of Gikuriro is 29 percent smaller. Then, a policy preference for Gikuriro is equivalent to asserting that it is worth foregoing the increase in productive assets in order to obtain the improvement in savings, or that the relative benet from percent increases in savings versus productive assets exceeds 4.06, the ratio of the dierential treatment eects. This kind of precision can help policymakers be much more exact as to the types of tradeos required to justify one type of intervention over another. Our design further reveals tradeos on the second, interpersonal margin. Within the cash arm, variation in the transfer amount provides one simple way of posing this question. The ratio of consumption impacts between the GD Small and Large treatment eects, for example, is 5.2, very close to the ratio of transfer amounts. This suggests that consumption impacts will scale linearly with transfer amounts. Other outcomes, such as savings or height-for-age, actually deteriorate slightly (and statistically insignicantly) under small transfers and are only improved with large transfers, suggesting that more resources must be concentrated on fewer households in order to drive these outcomes. We can also compare Gikuriro to cash in this respect. While at cost-equivalent values, Gikuriro demonstrates larger impacts on savings than a household grant, the results in Table 7 demonstrate that this is specic to the relatively small value of the cash transfer involved. We can use the slope term on the transfer amount to calculate the smallest transfer at which the benet of cash would exceed Gikuriro; for savings this number is $694, and for HAZ it is $277. Obviously, on a xed budget large cash transfers can only be given to a smaller number of households. So we can use our estimates to paramaterize tradeos between cash transfer and Gikuriro in terms of the types of outcomes we would be able to drive as we concentrate more resources on fewer households. The elasticity of cash's impacts as amounts are varied illustrates that programmatic choices hinge not only on preferences for equality across beneciaries, but the specic outcomes being targeted.20The strong consumption benets that have quite consistently been found in large cash transfer programs may well tip the scales in favor of concentrated programs, even for inequality-averse planners. 20More generally, one might characterize funders as having, e.g., CES preferences of the form W i\u0000P k kx\u001a ik\u0001 of program objectives xik. Here, k captures the relative weight of outcome kin funder preferences, \u001acaptures the extent of substitutability across these outcomes, and > 0captures the degree of substitutability across individuals (with a low value of implying a strong preference for equality across beneciaries). 35Given the nuance of our results, it is hard to square these results with any simple idea of cash transfers as a kind of uni-dimensional 'index fund'. While business investment has a single, cardinal objective (nancial prot), humanitarian investment is undertaken with many goals in mind, and a perfect reconciling of these competing benets would require a clear statement of tradeos in this multi-dimensional space. Perhaps a clearer way of stating the counterfactual provided by unconditional cash is that it gives us a statement of the priorities that the beneciaries themselves hold when credit constraints are relaxed, and thereby motivates us to be clearer about the logic underlying paternalistic development programs. While beneciary decisions may not be 'optimal' in terms of long-term social welfare (due high discount rates, to self- or other-control problem, or to resource and information constraints for example), the impact of unconditional money is nonetheless a powerful statement of the outcomes that the beneciaries themselves want changed. For us to argue that a program is justied in using resources to drive outcomes dierent from the ones the benecaries would choose, we should have a clear reason why they fail to arrive at the right decision themselves. This is a view of benchmarking that is not about picking a winner but rather about quantifying tradeos. 36References Aguero, Jorge, Michael Carter, and Ingrid \"The impact of unconditional cash transfers on nutrition: The South African Child Support Grant,\" 2006.

The information below is approved by the Rwanda Ministry of Health. Infant Nutrition Infants less than 6 months old should be fed by breast only. During this period an infant receives only breast milk and no other liquids or solids, not even water, unles s medically indicated. A non -breastfed baby is 14 times more likely to die than an exclusively breastfed baby in the first 6 months. Infants 6 to 24 months old should continue to be fed by breast, but should also receive complementary feeding that includes animal -source foods (meats, fish, milk products, eggs) and fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin A (such as mango, papaya, oranges, yellow sweet potato and carrots). Guidelines are for kids 6 -24 months to eat at least 4 food groups: fruits, veget ables and legumes, grains, meats, dairy. Infants 6 to 8 months old should be fed complementary foods 2 -3 times daily; Infants 9 to 24 months old should be fed complementary foods 3 -4 times daily, plus 1 -2 snacks. Reducing Illness If you or your children g et diarrh oea, use Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) to replace the nutrients being lost. Typical symptoms of diarrh oea include frequent, loose, watery stools, abdominal cramps, and/or abdominal pain. If ORS is not available, a simple solution can be prepared for drinking by mixing one liter of clean drinkin g water and mix it with \u00bd teaspoon of salt and 6 teaspoons of sugar. The government has a 6 -monthly deworming program and Vitamin A supplementation program. Ask your Community Health Worker for more informat ion. Dietary Diversity Anemia Anemia is a health condition, commonly caused by nutritional deficiency of iron and other nutrients (folate or vitamin B12). Around 72% of 6 -8 months -olds in Rwanda have Anemia. Anemia can be an underlying cause for maternal death and prenatal and perinatal infant loss. Anemia among children is associated with low mental performance and physical development. Examples of iron -rich food: fish, meat, milk products, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, guavas, papayas, and green leafy vegetables. Breast milk for your child is an important source of iron, too. Here are some other examples of food you can produce/buy/ eat to cheaply increase nutrition: 582 Breeding small, inexpensive animals such as hens, rabbits and guinea pi gs can provide you and your children with important body building protein and other important nutrients. Grow kitchen gardens if you have time. You can grow different vegetables for your family throughout the year, like amaranths, carrots, and dark -green leaves such as s pinach and dodo , all of which are important sources of body protecting nutrients. Consume soya beans, yogurt, avocados and dodo (which you could grow) Eat orange -flesh rather than white -flesh sweet potatoes Hygiene Handwashing with soap or wood ash can kil l bacteria/viruses and prevent s the spread of disease. Handwashing with soap at critical times is estimated to reduce diarrhoea by 47%. The most important times that hands should be washed with soap and water are: After defecating After cleaning a child who has defecated Before eating or handling food Recommended practices for personal hygiene further include: Washing hair every week with shampoo Washing the face every day after sleeping Brushing teeth twice every day, in the morning and the night after e ating Safe disposal of waste means defecating into a latrine, disposing into a latrine, or burial. Inappropriate disposal of human feces, such as open defecation, facilitates the transmission of pathogens and disease. Birth preparedness for delivery Early initiation of antenatal care (ANC) can reduce common maternal complications and maternal and perinatal mortality. Visit your nearest health facility early d uring pregnancy for medical tests and more information . The World Health Organization promotes four antenatal clinic visits, one in each trimester, during each pregnancy.59Appendix B Selection of control variables In our pre-analysis plan, we state that control variables for the primary specication \"will be selected on the basis of their ability to predict the primary outcomes\". In doing so, we seek to build on recent developments that balance the challenge of using baseline data to select variables that will reduce residual variance in equation (1) with the danger that researcher freedom in the selection of control variables can lead to p-hacking, in which right-hand-side variables are selected specically on the basis of the statistical signicance of the coecient of interest (Card and Krueger, 1995; Casey et al., 2012), thereby invalidating inference. To balance these concerns, we follow the post-double-selection approach set forth in Belloni et al. (2014b). Those authors advocate a two-step procedure in which, rst, Lasso is used to automate the selection of control variables, and second, the post-Lasso estimator (Belloni et al., 2012) is used to estimate the coecients of primary interest in Equation (1), eectively using Lasso as a model selection device but notimposing the shrunken coecients that results from the Lasso estimates directly. Belloni et al. (2014b) demonstrate that this approach not only reduces bias in estimated treatment eects better than alternative approaches\u2014less a concern given the successful randomization in our experiment\u2014but that it may improve power while retaining uniformly valid inference. In the rst stage, model selection is undertaken by retaining control variables from the union of those chosen either as predictive of the treatment assignment or of the outcome. This model selection stage can be undertaken after residualizing to account for a set of control variables that the authors have a priori determined belonw in the model, as in Belloni et al. (2014a); in our case, we retain block xed eects, lagged values of the outcome, and lagged values of (the inverse hyperbolic sine of) household wealth in all specications, per our pre-analysis plan. We modify the heteroskedasticity-robust Lasso estimator of Belloni et al. (2012) to incorporate sampling weights consistent with our design, using the Lasso penalty is chosen as a function of the sample size and the number of potential covariates, as in Belloni et al. (2014a). Resulting covariates selected for each of the primary and secondary outcomes, at household and individual level, are presented in Tables B.1 and B.2, respectively.
