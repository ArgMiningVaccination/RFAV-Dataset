He has been drug resistance ,so far we have tried over 10 meds. he is on lamictal 100mg morning 125mg night , Tileptal 3mL. morning and evening We have just added Trileptal ,he has been on Trileptal for 2 weeks today and has been SZ. free 10 out of 14 nights ,wich for us is the most control we have ever had with any med. His Neuro. is recommending the New VNS . He has a normal MRI ,he is not a candidate for surgery at the moment. Genentic Testing is normal . His SZ. are during sleep ,nap, or on awaking . We have tried Keto diet ,gluten free ect. We recently started seeing a holistic doctor ,he had a sample of his hair sent too a lab for heavy metal testing ,and my sons test came back with really high levels of ,Mercury ,Arsenic,Cadmium,Aluminum,and a few others . I did not trust the results so I had testing done ,from another Lab and same results came back high metals again so I believe the results. I have shared the results with his Neuro. at Childrens Hospital ,and she has been very dismissive saying she doesn't know much about heavy metal toxicity. The holistic Dr. is recommending ,a natural slow chelating agent, Modified Citrus Pectin, and few minerals ,he says this is the safest way for a young boy with refractory epilepsy to chelate . Does anyone have any thoughts on this ? It seems mainstream medicine does not pay much attention too Heavy Metals causing SZ. ,are we too ignore the results . Any thoughts ? Warm Regards Sandy Comments Hello and thanks for the Submitted by sandy flores m on Wed, 2016-08-31 - 14:48 Hello and thanks for the replies ,The concerns you all have stated are the exact same reasons we are so confused, and have held off on the holistic Dr.advise .My son has idiopathic focal epilepsy,he has been having SZ everytime he naps ,or at night in his sleep,this has been happening every single day for 3 years . He has an aura ,1 min. tonic clonic 1 min. myoclonic jerks 1min. in that order always .The Trileptal we just started has been the only AED that has helped ,and is helping as we are still adjusting and so on.Still since his epilepsy is idiopathic even if we get control with Trileptal ,we feel it that and VNS is just putting a bandaid on an underlying condition that could be the toxic metals in his body ,that's were we are so frustrated and confused .Don't get me wrong we are super exited that something seems too be working .I don't think we are the only ones that have this specific case ,hopefully someone that has dealt with heavy metals and epilepsy will come along and share their experience .Maybe the metals are causing these seizures .Warm Regards Sandy It makes perfect sense to me Submitted by Jadeite on Tue, 2018-04-17 - 21:15 It makes perfect sense to me so the brain fires neurosynapses and aluminum and some other heavy metals listed in your description of hair sample. This is cause for epilepsy itself. Getting rid of heavy metal blocking neurosynapses will heal the broken programming and dog will be able to go back to normal. This is the simple version of what's going on. Boron and iodine supplement is good for heavy metal detox. The heavy metals come out in the urine. Also check ph levels of your boy and make sure his body is within 5.2 -6.8 at least. Acidic body is cause for slow neural connections through out the body. Electricity travels through an electrolytic enviroment better then a neutral enviroment. This is why higher ph is better to use. All the bodies immune system is communicate through neural pathways. When In acidic enviroment white blood cells associated with immune system move sluggish and when the alkalinity is changed to a higher ph the white blood cells move faster and are alert. The vaccinations have to stop in our world. It's hurting the innocent..mercury is also in vaccines and Mercury is linked to autism and major neural netway blockages. On top of all this diet is everything. Ketone is not bad to keep up with. Most foods today are gmo, glycophosphate saturated poison. Organic and verify through research that organic is in fact just that. The gov has made it legal for labels to be falsified into making people believe things that are not are organic. Sorry thays a tongue twister lol. Hope all this helps. Sorry for some autocorrected Submitted by Jadeite on Tue, 2018-04-17 - 21:19 Sorry for some autocorrected words out of place. I trust your all intelligent to see past small obstacles like that. Bless all... Absolutely! Our bodies are Submitted by RichardGreens on Fri, 2018-11-02 - 00:14 Absolutely! Our bodies are basically batteries! Any imbalance causes multiple health problems. A majority of what we consume is alkaline, acidic, or is a metal. All life requires it! Alot is also ph neutral. Find your ph in morning with spit or first pee on a ph strip to know what you need to do Hi Nikki, how is your son Submitted by gracebays on Thu, 2019-09-12 - 02:55 Hi Nikki, how is your son doing now? I feel exactly the same way with my son. He's much younger, but in similar situation. Docs haven't been able to find a cause and now think it's due to a single letter gene mutation, though they can't be sure because they say they've never seen it before. Research shows genes can play a role, as every individual has a different threshold to tolerating toxins such as heavy metals, but does not directly cause epilepsy. DNA is stronger than that. Heavy metals absolutely can cause epilepsy, as they confuse the immune system, even having been known to have degenerative properties on neurons, compete for receptors and block them, and many, many more troubling issues. for example,https://youtu.be/vrtbjCxHST0 Hi Nikki, how is your son Submitted by gracebays on Thu, 2019-09-12 - 03:13 Hi Nikki, how is your son doing now?

Please let me know how Submitted by gracebays on Thu, 2019-09-12 - 03:13 Sandy! Please let me know how you're doing. We've been told the same thing, and it makes total sense. Look at this!https://youtu.be/M0cDCJGk6MwWe're constantly being lied to. I used to think this was some far fetched conspiracy theory for paranoids, but now am seeing that MD are truly misinformed in many things, not at all trained in even nutrition, but only to have a pen handy for prescriptions. After all, chronically ill people are hospitals' and pharmaceuticals' bread and butter. Western medicine is the only approach that deals only with symptoms and doesn't go to solve the root of the problem. They are absolutely the best with acute situations such as broken bones or surgery, but is grossly short in preventative care and wellness as a whole. They say diabetes is irreversible and ulcers can only be healed with surgery. Yet, my husband is living proof that both these conditions can be completely absolved with diet alone. Hello Sandy,My daughter also Submitted by Zeinab on Tue, 2020-01-21 - 03:26 Hello Sandy,My daughter also had SZ and she was having heavy metals, so after they diagnosed her with epilepsy, and mention to her doctor about heavy metal she ignored that,So after searching and talking with a holistic doctor I start with her detoxing system, and she is now 6 months SZs free, and I didn't use any SZs medicine..I advice you to start with your son in detoxing, because I believe that the metal toxic behind the SZs.Best regards.Zeinb More importantly, u hv to Submitted by Eben on Wed, 2020-01-29 - 20:16 More importantly, u hv to identify and reduce potential future reinfection. Drinking water, clothing, rubber, platic and household cleaning products and pesticides are known to contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals.Chelating agents are dangerous because they also absorb other minerals, so longterm use causes deficiency, and short term use mess up ur metabolism and enzyme reactions..

Dear NikiI ready aeveral Submitted by Eben on Wed, 2020-01-29 - 20:40 Dear NikiI ready aeveral studies that showed how Several strains of probiotics - like those found in Live plain yogurt - have the ability to bind to and neutralise various heavy metals. Besides avoiding infectious sources, try eating hight doses of plain live yogurt and other fermented foods. Also include raw oats which has exvellent binding capabilities in the gut, but drink plenty of liquids. A raw oats smoothie with "}
