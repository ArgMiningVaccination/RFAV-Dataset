Black pepper oil Turns absent-mindedness into alertness and focus. How To Use Essential Oils For Increased Energy & Focus You can use EOs topically or via inhalation. If you're using them directly on the skin always dilute them with a carrier oil like coconut oil or jojoba oil for best effect. Stick to 2-3 drops of EO per 1 teaspoon of carrier oil. Mix them together to create a lotion mixture. Rub your forehead, temples, neck, and shoulders. Inhalation is the best and most effective way to increase energy and focus. Essential oil diffusers are great for a less concentrated but continuous dose. Simply turn your diffuser on whenever you are studying, working, or feeling tired. Another more concentrated option is to make your own inhalers so you can use them anywhere and anytime you need them. Keep reading below for specific recipes for both diffuser and inhaler blends. Safety Concerns - When used safely, EOs usually offer little to no side effects. - When used topically as a natural aid for more energy and focus, EOs must always be diluted in a carrier oil to prevent skin irritation and reactions. (Especially if you have sensitive skin.) - It's advisable to perform a patch test on a non-affected area of the skin and wait 24 hours to confirm no allergic reaction. - If you experience any adverse reaction to any oil, discontinue use immediately and consult your healthcare provider to seek medical advice. - Some oils are not suitable for babies, young children, and pregnant or nursing women. Research the contraindications for each oil you use prior to applying them. - EOs aren't regulated by the FDA (Food & Drug Administration), so it's essential to do your research before buying products to make sure they aren't diluted or contaminated. - Always choose high-quality, certified organic, and therapeutic grade products to make sure you're experiencing the full medicinal benefits. 2 DIY Essential Oil Blends To Make Right Now AWAKE Energizing Blend Diffuser blend - 3 drops of grapefruit essential oil - 3 drops of lemon essential oil - 3 drops of orange essential oil - 3 drops of peppermint essential oil Add the oils, fill your diffuser with water, and get ready to feel invigorated.
