I start every day by taking a deep breath and then my meditation begins. Here's how it goes: Saa, taa, naa, maa; saa, ta, na, maa; saa .....shoot I need to send that email..Mia please focus on clearing your mind.... sa, ta, naa, maa .....I should call my sister about..Mia, OK sorry yes here we go, inhale and exhale, fill your thoughts with clarity, your ears with tranquility and feel the earth support you -ahhh, away I go. Some days my meditation goes like this, constantly being interrupted by the nattering voice inside my head. Other days I can flow right into my sacred space of peace. There are days when 5 minutes is a struggle, and when 20 minutes feels short lived. The one thing that stays constant though, is the euphoria, pleasure and benefit I receive from putting in this dedication. It is a life long progress and the beautiful thing is that every day I learn something new about myself. I was introduced to meditation through yoga. Anyone who has ever done yoga knows that the most fundamental element of the practice is Savasana (aka corpse pose). I really never thought much about this position (I enjoyed all my balancing positions so much more than just lying there) but at one point my wise yoga instructor indicated that this was the most important part of the practice so I started to pay more attention. When I started meditating, I was hard pressed not to be doing a mental tally of my tasks for the day, or sometimes worse, to fall into a small cat nap. Slowly, the more I realized how important this aspect was. Meditation not only became a fundamental component to my yoga practice, but also to my life. Once I truly started focusing on my art of meditation, I felt and saw the benefits immediately. There was a time when I would have only 20 minutes, going through a sequence of 5 to 7 postures - with a little meditation at the end. Now, with that same 20 minutes, I'll choose meditation in lieu of a practice. Why? I now understand that the mind is our most precious muscle, to be conditioned, nurtured and loved; it should take precedence. Story continued below Once I truly started focusing on my art of meditation, I felt and saw the benefits immediately. I'm able to better manage my time and not go ballistic when under stressful deadlines at work - I come back to my breath and the tranquility I find through meditation. A recent [study](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01551/full) from UCLA reported that those who cultivate a daily meditation practice over a period of time preserve their brains more than those who do not meditate as they go through their aging process. How do we improve? This is the key word, practice...just like anything else in life. Through dedication, through consistency - try, try, and try again. Some days are better than others, I get that, honestly, at the beginning I was ecstatic that I was able to meditate for a whole minute at a time! There are a plethora of ways one can learn how to meditate and I suggest you try them all. Just like yoga or fitness, you should look to find a style that calls to you, that suits your own personal needs, bringing you to a pleasurable and peaceful space. Here's a great way to start: find a comfortable place to sit, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. For the next 5 minutes, check in with how you feel, how your body and mental state feel. You may even want to have a chant of sounds or words. Whenever you have a thought - gently push it away. The idea is to keep a clear, uncluttered mind, if only for the duration of your practice! When I find this place of stillness, it's energizing but calm. It takes me away to this beautiful light inside my soul, and I can feel myself healing with joy and love. When I come out of my meditations, there's this sense of rightness, of belonging and knowing that I'm doing my best in this life. I have the confidence that I can handle whatever comes across my path, and I work to do so with grace and integrity. Story continued below My favourite time to meditate is when I first wake up and have a new day ahead of me, but I have to admit there are times that I find myself in the frenzy of life and think I may not have the time. In those moments, I try to remind myself how much this practice that I've cultivated has improved my life, and so I will find myself on transit meditating, or even finding a few spare minutes during work. Play, discover, find your happy place, and you will see the benefits come into your life. You'll find that sweet place, that light and love shine through - focus on your breath, your life force.
