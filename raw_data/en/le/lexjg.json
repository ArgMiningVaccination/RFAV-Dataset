During a three-month trial, patients with osteopenia were given Calcifood \u00ae, Ostrophin PMG\u00ae, and Cataplex\u00ae D the regular dosage. Osteocalcin was unchanged while urinary Dpd, a marker used to assess relative rates of bone loss secretion, decreased 18%. Decreased Dpd suggests that less bone was lost over the three months. No change in osteocalcin further suggests a positive environment for bone formation.Calcifood\u00ae, Ostrophin PMG\u00ae, and Cataplex\u00ae D, used together, were found to decrease urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpd), while maintaining osteocalcin levels (see chart). These bone health supplements are unique because they provide readily absorbed nutrients from bone tissues to support the process of rebuilding and maintaining bone.* To nd out more about these and other Standard Process products, call 800-558-8740 and ask for our Bone Health Literature Packet (L6213) or visit standardprocess.com.

Printed in the USA.about the coverThis painting was inspired by a Sumerian creation myth dating earlier than 5000 BCE and depicts the god Enki, often associated with the stag, and Lady Ki, the earth. Together this divine pair created what historians refer to as the Fertile Crescent, a place now known as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Below is a brief explanation of this paint-ing, written as if spoken by master magician Enki, patron god of artisans, also known as Sweet Water. \"From the very beginning, when my beloved and I rst arrived at this place, we saw possibility. Creatrix and creator, together we fashioned clay prototypes for all manner of living beings. I assisting, Ki birthed our plant children and the world became a living tapestry. I then bathed her weary body with fresh fl owing waters and on a whim, to see her smile, lled these with dancing sh. My Lady Ki: fertility itself, wherever she steps there springs forth abundance! We two, the Great Stag and Mother of Earth, populated the earth with all that runs and fl ies. Ki's supple energy is replicated in all green and fecund things, and to this day everywhere I look, I see her face.\" Ki and Enki Rest After Their Labors . Watercolor and pencil, Helena Nelson-Reed.

A few of my personal favorites: NT Factor Energy I prescribe this to my patients because it provides a noticeable improvement in their energy levels. By promoting healthy mitochondrial membrane repair (and not through the use of any stimulants), most of my patients report that they feel better. I discovered this product at a medical conference, and was intrigued by the research. One of the published studies reported that patients experienced a 40% decrease in fatigue(1) in eight weeks. The product is formulated to deliver a stabilized unique phospholipid matrix (this is what composes the mitochondrial membranes), wrapped in pre and probiotics as well as Mitochondrial Pro Regulator to optimize mitochondrial function, Krebs Cycle Glucose Absorb to propel the burning of glucose, creating en ergy and removal of excess ammonia which can cause fatigue, and RN Fatty Acid Metabolizer to maximize ATP Joseph Burrascano, MD Call 800-755-3402 ResearchedNutritionals.com (1) Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association 2003; 6(1); 23-28.

This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any dis ease.production by regulating fatty acid buildup which, if left unchecked reduces mitochondrial function and increases cellular toxins. Normally, cells produce and repair their ow n mitochondrial membranes. However, these membranes may become compromised during long-term illness or interestingly, intense physical exercise by healthy individuals. This product helps the body help itself. By improving cell membrane potential, nutrients are better able to enter the cells for greater ATP fuel production, toxin removal is improved and oxidative stress is reduced. CoQ10 Power 400mg I actually tested the blood level of a patient on this product versus another well-known CoQ10. The patient using CoQ10 Power had three times the CoQ10 in the blood than the other product. As I have come to expect from Re- searched Nutritionals, the raw material is of the highest quality and is imported from Japan. Transfer Factor Multi-Immune People have asked me what differentiates transfer factor from colostrum. I generally reply that it is supercharged colostrum. In every gallon of colostrum, you derive only an ounce or two of pure transfer factor. This is where you find the heart of immune support. Maintaining natural killer cell function is essential for achieving optimal health. Each capsule of Transfer Factor Multi-Immune combines the following complexes to provide optimal natural killer cell support: x\u0003NK Maximizer Bioplex - larch arabinogalactan, IP-6, shiitake and maitake mushrooms to promote levels & immune modulation x\u0003Macrophage & T-Cell Pro-Blend - Proprietary blend of and TMG for healthy macrophage and neutrophil su pport, aiding removal of cellular debris and recovery of damaged tissue. Unique blend also supports proper T-cell function, cellular replication and liver function. x\u0003Healthy Cell GTP - Potent extracts of green tea and pomegranate to promote normal cell division and containing high levels of crucial antioxidants. x\u0003Plus an integrated blend of folic acid, vitamin B-12, zinc, and selenium to strengthen immune function, promote normal cell growth and boost antioxidant levels. I believe a healthy energy level and a fortified immune system are essential to good health. Best Regards, Dr. B.

Mark A. Hyman, MD, is the editor in chief of Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. (Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(2):10-12.) The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie\u2014deliberate, contrived and dishonest\u2014but the myth\u2014persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clich\u00e9s of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. \u2014John F. Kennedy Obesity is obvious. Just look around the American landscape. But memory loss and cognitive decline is invisible\u2014and more fearsome. Alzheimer's disease will affect 30% (and some experts say 50%) of people over 85 years old, which is the fastest growing seg- ment of the population. The prevalence of Alzheimer's is expected to increase 3-fold by 2050 affecting 14 million people, at an annual cost at $83.9 billion to our healthcare system and society, 1 which doesn't even begin to account for the untold suffering on families and caregivers. It is now the seventh leading cause of death. 2 With Alzheimer's we are facing a global problem. It is project- ed to increase 285% in North America, 534% in South America, 476% in Africa, and 497% in Asia by 2050. 3 Even small progress in preventing the disease and slowing its progression will have a pro-found impact on the personal and nancial costs we will bear. If we want to do something other than provide palliative care, we must ask certain questions. What is dementia? What causes it? Is it uniformly the same disease or the heterogeneous manifestation of multiple genetic and environmental insults? Can it be prevented? Can it be slowed, stopped, or even cured? And why are we seeing growths of epidemic proportions of the incidence of cognitive dys-function, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia? Conventionally dementia falls into 2 main categories\u2014Alzheim- er's and vascular dementia, with many other minor variations. Therapy is limited to 2 main categories of medication\u2014acteylcholin-esterase inhibitors and NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptor antagonists, neither of which addresses the causes of dementia and both of which are marginally effective (if at all) and have signi cant side effects. New treatments such as vaccines are on the horizon. Emerging research indicates that inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction are key mediators of brain degeneration. But rarely is the question explored as to why these processes occur. What are the proximal causes? Is there another clinical model for preventing, treating, and even reversing cognitive decline and dementia? Even more, mounting research suggests that loss of cognitive function is not a homoge-neous process and that Alzheimer's or dementia is not a single dis-order but a common clinical manifestation of disordered neuronal function arising from a multitude of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors unique to each individual. Even if large-scale system-based clinical trials are yet to be done\u2014or dif cult to do\u2014if we can assemble existing data into safe lifestyle-based and nutritional inter-ventions for optimizing brain function, then we might hold back the tsunami of broken brains and broken lives we face. HEALING THE MIND AND REVERSING DEMENTIA: IS IT POSSIBLE? New research suggests that focusing on the \"disease\" called dementia and nding drugs to modify downstream effects of brain injury such as insuf ciency of acetylcholine misses the opportunity to address the real problems. In fact, \"dementia\" does not exist but is simply a common collection of symptoms that explain nothing about the underlying etiology or pathophysiology. These include infl ammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and other hor-monal dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, nutritional de - ciency, and toxic injury. The question is not how to treat dementia, because it is not a single disorder, but how to nd the underlying reasons for our broken brains and how to x them. The cognitive dysfunction we call dementia is simply the way the body expresses injury to a myriad of insults that can be quite different from person to person. No 2 \"dementias\" are exactly alike. But how do we apply molecular personalized genomic medi-cine to such a complex disorder? The answer is quite simple. Ample science lays out the pat- terns of dysfunction in dementia and, to a great degree, most of the precipitating causes. Then our individual genetic differences and predispositions set us up for biological breakdown from the same few common insults\u2014toxins such as mercury, digestive imbalanc-es, nutritional de ciencies or excesses, stress, allergens, infections. These in turn, lead to the altered physiological processes we see in the \"dementias\"\u2014infl ammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. We have to think about individuals, not diseases. In medicine our differences (genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, diets, and stresses) are more important than our similarities. Sometimes the practice of medicine lags behind the science, and sometimes the practice gets ahead of the science. Genetic testing DOES DEMENTIA EXIST? DISPELLING THE MYTH Mark A. Hyman, MDEditorialALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 11 Does Dementia Exist?puts us squarely in the middle of that dilemma. We are at a crossroads where the old ideas we have about dis- ease and diagnosis become less meaningful as we understand more and more about the importance of individual differences in deter-mining illness. This is a time when personalized medicine will replace medicine based on diagnosis and disease. In fact, disease and diagnosis as we know it (ICD-9 classi cation of diseases) will soon be an obsolete concept, an artifact of medical history like bloodletting or phrenology (the art of diagnosis based on the shape of your skull, popular in the 19th century). AN \"N\" OF 1: REVERSING DEMENTIA As a medical student, I participated in a public health research project in a remote Nepalese village. In exchange for the villagers' help, we offered an improvised outdoor medical clinic. One man brought his mother to our clinic after carrying her on his back for 10 days through the Himalayas. I asked how we could help. He said his mother was blind. She had cataracts. There was nothing we could do. That is how I felt about my patients with dementia until I met \"George.\" George presented with dementia. His story is an exam-ple of how treating a person\u2014not a disease\u2014leads to improved clinical outcomes; how environmental infl uences on genetic predis- positions\u2014mostly mercury exposure in this case\u2014can lead to any number of diseases depending on individual genetic variations. George presented with a diagnosis of dementia after a com- prehensive neurological evaluation including neuropsychological testing, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), MRA (magnetic reso-nance angiography), and SPECT (single-photon emission comput-erized tomography) scanning. When he came with his wife to see me, he could no longer manage his business affairs, had become increasingly unable to function at home, and had to withdraw from family and social relationships. HOW THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS YOUR GENES: A CASE OF MERCURY POISONING Chronic diseases, like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, or cancer are usually multi-gene disorders. It is not 1 gene but the interaction between many genes, their variations or single nucle-otide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the environment that puts someone at risk for a chronic disease such as dementia. That is why we will never nd \"the\" gene for Alzheimer's\u2014or heart disease, cancer, autism, or depression. In the case of George, whose mind and life were evaporating, I looked deeply into his genes and the biochemistry his genes con-trolled and found places we could improve things. He was homozy-gous for apo E4, a high-risk gene for Alzheimer's disease 4 that also predisposes to dyslipidemia and impaired heavy metal detoxi ca- tion from the brain.5 A 6-hour DMPS provocation challenge test for heavy metals* revealed mercury of 350 mg/g creatinine (normal < 3 mg/g creati-nine). Sources of mercury include vaporization of dental llings or environmental exposures from tuna sh or air pollution. 6 George lived his life in an industrial area with large coal burning plants and had many dental amalgams. 7 Mercury toxicity is a potent neuro-toxin linked to many neurological disorders including dementia.8 In one study of 465 patients with chronic mercury toxicity, 32% had severe fatigue, 88% had memory loss, and almost 30% had depression. These symptoms and mercury poisoning were much more common in people with the apo E4 gene. Removal of amal-gam fillings combined with a mercury detoxification program resulted in signi cant symptom reduction. 9 Other genes act synergistically with apo E4 to amplify risk. Common polymorphisms of genes regulating glutathione metabo-lism, the main detoxi er of metals in the body, such as glutathione- S-transferase (GST), 10 increase risk of cognitive impairment. Combinations of GST and apo E4 polymorphisms further increase risk for dementia. 11 George carried the GSTM1 null or absent SNP. Carriers of the null (or absent) polymorphisms for GST have higher total body burdens of mercury. 12 Genes load the gun, and the envi- ronment pulls the trigger. George had an elevated homocysteine homozygous for homocysteine, which can dou-ble the risk of dementia. 14 Disruptions of 2 key interdependent, interconnected biochemical cycles are at the root of the physiologi-cal dysfunction we see in most chronic diseases. These are the methylation and trans-sulfuration (glutathione metabolism) cycles. They are necessary for proper detoxi cation and redox balance, as well as modulation of immune response, control of gene expres-sion, membrane function, and more. Polymorphisms in any of the enzymes facilitating these cycles may increase the risk of chronic disease, particularly neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as dementia, autism, ADHD, and depression. Adequate concentra-tions and active forms of nutrient cofactors involved in especially methylcobalamin (B12), 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), and pyridoxine (B6), as well as adequate dietary sources of sulfur are essential for proper function of the methylation and sulfation cycles. Lastly, George had a polymorphism of cholesterol ester trans- fer protein (CETP). This gene limits HDL reverse transport of cho-lesterol and increases risk of hyperlipidemia. CETP polymorphisms act synergistically with apo E4 to increase the risk of dementia. 15 For George, those SNPs (apo E4, GSTM1, MTHFR, CETP) acted synergistically to increase his risk and made him in one way or another susceptible to environmental insults from mercury overload, nutritional de ciencies of folate or B 12, and dietary infl u- ences on cholesterol and insulin sensitivity. Other studies show similar polymorphisms in autism 16 and depression.17 In fact, these may be simply different manifestations across the age spectrum of the same \"disease.\" The genetics, biochemistry, and physiology of these conditions overlap and arise from common roots. What is critical to remember is that these genes are highly regulated and their expression modi ed by nutrient and lifestyle inputs. *Blood levels of mercury only refl ect recent exposure from pollution or sh consump- tion, but a provocation test identi es total body burden of mercury. Studies have found that using DMPS increases mercury excretion from 3- to 107-fold. The chelating agents or drugs, DMPS and DMSA, are both used to treat heavy metal toxicity.12 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Does Dementia Exist?PERSONALIZED MEDICINE: A CURRENT REALITY OR FUTURE POSSIBILITY? Based on George's unique genotype and his phenotypic expression (elevated body burden of mercury, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperhomocysteinemia, low glutathione, and impaired detoxification), a therapeutic plan was developed to address his entire systemic dysfunction. George also had a 30-year history of irritable and infl ammatory bowel diseases, which has been linked to dementia and other neuropathologies. 18 The single gene, single disease, single drug model is inappro- priate for complex multi-gene systemic disorders with common manifestations but differing etiologies such as dementia. The com-ponents of his therapeutic plan were design to remove toxic trig-gers (mercury, poor diet, dysbiosis), while optimizing nutrient-regulated gene expression. Doing just one thing wouldn't help George. Treatment required addressing all the imbalances, the causative factors, and their effects systematically. Treatment included careful mercury detoxi cation including safe amalgam removal and chelation. 19 Phytonutrients and nutrients that upregulate glutathione, including cruciferous vegetables such as kale, watercress, and cilantro; herbs such as milk thistle; nutrients such as selenium and zinc, were added to his diet. His hyperlipi-demia and insulin resistance were managed with a low glycemic load, plant-based high- ber whole foods, organic diet, and exercise. To further improve his genetic limitations in methylation and sulfation, he was treated with high doses of MTHF (methyl-tetra-hydrofolate), 20 methylcobalamin,21 and B6. To address his gut infl ammation, food allergens were eliminated, small bowel bacteri- al overgrowth was treated, and enzymes and probiotics were replaced. Additional basic nutritional support, including a multivi-tamin and omega 3 fatty acids, 22 was provided. After a year of aggressive therapy that was matched to his quirky genes and biochemistry\u2014not his diagnosis\u2014George had a remarkable and dramatic recovery. Before I saw him, he could not manage his business nor did his grandchildren want to be around him. After matching his treatment to his genes, he was again to function able, and his grandchildren loved being with him. Although this area of genetic testing and nutrigenomics is new and more research is needed to help us re ne our understand- ing and treatment, there are ways to look through new doors into an entirely new era of medicine\u2014one that no longer focuses on the disease but on the person and his or her uniqueness. Widespread gene testing is not ready for primetime, but it can be a helpful guide in understanding the origins and the risks of some chronic illnesses. But we have to recognize that it is the interplay of many genes interacting with the environment that determines our health. What we do know is that there is no single gene for Alzheimer's\u2014or autism, depression, heart disease, or cancer. In fact, those diseases, as single homogeneous, uniform conditions, do not exist. We must give up that myth. Instead, there are common variations in the symphony of our gene patterns that are integral to many chronic diseases. These patterns vary from person to person and are highly infl uenced by diet, stress, infections, allergens, and toxins. The time has come to focus on systems approaches to com- plex systems disorders. Treatment based on mechanism, genetics, biochemistry, and physiology will supplant diagnosis-based treat-ment. Clinicians can begin to navigate with a different map for the territory of illness than the one we received in our training and in the process can become re-enchanted with medicine and the possi-bility of healing where there was none.

Learn more about Dr Bland at www.JeffreyBland.com. (Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(2):16-18.) Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is \"something you heard about from your hairdresser, who thinks she saw it on Oprah \u2014a category that . . . includes acupuncture, homeopathy, healing magnets and assorted herbs and supplements.\" 1 This is a quote from Jerry Adler's editorial in the December 1, 2007, issue of Newsweek titled, \"A Big Dose of Skepticism.\" The editorial repre- sents a strong \"shot across the bow\" of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health as well as the tens of thousands of licensed CAM practitioners and millions of their patients who reg-ularly employ what have been termed \"CAM therapies.\" Mr Adler states that his 2008 resolution as a medical writer is to \"not report on any new treatments for anything, unless they were tested in large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials published in high-quality peer-reviewed medical jour-nals.\" He takes his lead in this advocacy from the recent book, Snake Oil Science: The Truth About Complementary and Alternative Medicine by R. Barker Bausell, PhD.2 In essence, Bausell makes a strong case using his background as a former director of research for the University of Maryland's Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine that all CAM therapies have an impact on health only by placebo-related effects. He bases his conclusions on the ef cacy of CAM therapies on the following 5 criteria: 1. Studies of CAM therapies that show bene t beyond place- bo effects have not been done well, whereas studies of CAM therapies that are methodologically sound have not dem-onstrated bene t beyond placebo. 2. Scientists and clinicians engaged in either the administra- tion or study of CAM therapies have an inherent bias in support of the positive nature of the therapies, and there-fore their conclusions are suspect. 3. Scientists and clinicians associated with CAM therapies do not understand methodological issues in the science of clinical tri-als such as the placebo effect, attrition/drop-out, the natural history of the disease in question, the Hawthorne effect, regres-sion to the mean, or statistical methods of analysis. 4. No scientific mechanism of action for the validity of CAM therapies has been proven beyond that of the known mechanism of action of the placebo effect. 5. There is a lack of understanding of the concept of parsi- mony (ie, Occam's razor) that results in unusual and unproven mechanisms beyond placebo effect to be ascribed to CAM therapies. In support of his contention that these 5 criteria de ne the limitations of CAM studies, Bausell provides evidence using the Cochrane Collaboration database 3-5 of 98 randomized, controlled CAM studies published in 4 top-tier, peer-reviewed journals: The New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Archives of Internal Medicine, and the Annals of Internal Medicine . These studies include acupunc- ture, herbal therapies, chelation therapy, traditional Chinese medi-cine (TCM), electrical stimulation techniques, hypnotherapy, homeopathy, intercessory prayer, massage, meditation, manipula-tive therapies, ultrasound, and nutritional supplements such as glu-cosamine. As he applies his criteria to the validity of these studies he shows that only 5% of the 98 published studies demonstrate posi-tive outcomes beyond that of placebo. It is this analysis that leads to his conclusion that \"after initiating [what appears to be a successful CAM] therapy, if you begin to experience some fall-off in its bene- ts, discuss the situation immediately with your therapist. Most experienced CAM therapists will have a menu of new strategies capable of initiating a new round of placebo effects.\" 2(p294) What is wrong with this analysis of the ef cacy of CAM ther- apies? The analysis is based on well-founded concerns from an expert in scienti c methodology. It would seem that Bausell has offered a fait accompli that wipes away thousands of years of histo- ry associated with the purported clinical success of many tradi-tional healing methods with the stroke of one scienti c eraser. But there is much more to the story than that which is told. First of all, he has seemingly lumped all of what is considered non- traditional medical intervention under the rubric of CAM. He has selectively chosen issues in the history of science to support his hypothesis that there is no basis of a clinical bene t for any CAM therapy (which many readers might interpret as \"non-pharmacologi-cal therapies\") beyond that of placebo. The implication of Bausell's argument is that the success that was witnessed with the develop-ment in the 1930s of antibiotic therapy ushered in the era of suc-cessful, non-placebo therapies 6 that, unlike CAM therapies, had demonstrable effects beyond that of placebo. With regard to the DOES COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE REPRESENT ONLY PLACEBO THERAPIES? Jeffrey Bland, PhD, FACN , FACBguest editorialALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 17 Does CAM Represent Only Placebo Therapies?necessity of conducting large randomized clinical trials to deter- mine non-placebo effects of a speci c therapy, it is interesting to note that many accepted surgical procedures have not been tested by randomized, placebo-controlled trials. They are, however, con-sidered standards of care based on agreement among trained medical professionals that they are ef cacious. 7 Also interesting is Bausell's contention that it is essential to know the mechanism of action of a speci c therapeutic interven- tion when it is well known that many of the pharmaceutical prepa-rations approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration do not have known mechanisms of action. 8 The de nitive criteria that establish the safety and ef cacy of any therapy may be a little more complicated than Bausell's analysis implies. There is another important limitation of using the random- ized, placebo-controlled trial as the only criterion for determining the non-placebo value of a therapy. The randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial favors the evaluation of an intervention that can be easily blinded and placebo-controlled. As such, it is an excellent methodology to evaluate the effect of 1 pill tested against 1 clinical endpoint\u2014for example a new-to-nature angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor blood pres-sure compared to an identical-looking placebo. This methodology, however, is not as easily applied when one wants to study the effect of a CAM therapy involving speci c diet or lifestyle inter-vention on blood pressure. Diet and lifestyle interventions are impossible to completely blind and therefore are more susceptible to issues related to the Hawthorne effect, compliance, dropout, or the placebo effect. The issue of the limitations of control of dietary intervention trials was discussed in a recent review describing the inter-individual variation of response that occurs in dietary studies and the need for managing genetic heterogeneity with large study groups and speci c dietary subgroup analysis. 9 This criticism can be applied to important studies such as the Dietary Approach to Stopping Hypertension (DASH). These studies demonstrated clinical validi-ty of the effect diet and lifestyle have on hypertension but did not ful ll Bausell's criteria of an acceptable, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 10,11 In the end, the well-designed study of a phar- maceutical product for hypertension has far fewer methodological issues confounding its results than do the diet-and-lifestyle inter-vention studies. 12,13 Beyond the obvious methodological challenge of how to blind and develop appropriate placebos for CAM intervention trials is another thorny issue. How long does it take to demonstrate true improved patient outcome in a clinical study? Most clinical inter-vention trials evaluating the effect of a new therapeutic agent for the management of a chronic health problem will be of a year's duration at most. It is assumed that at the end of this period of time the safety and effectiveness of the agent has been \"proven.\" But what if this agent is applied in clinical practice for a much lon-ger duration than the 1 year it was studied? Many patients with a chronic disease have their therapies applied inde nitely, as is the case with type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis pain and disability, chron-ic digestive problems such as esophageal refl ux disease, chronic depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hyperlipidemias, and hypertension. 14,15 In these cases the true safety and effectiveness of the therapy that had been proven through the administration of a successful short-term randomized, placebo-controlled trial might in the longer term prove to either not improve outcome or even cause serious adverse effects. An example is the recent voluntary recall of the selective COX-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib by Merck & Co (Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) due to the number of adverse drug reactions that occurred after patients had been taking the drug for an extended period of time. 16,17 It wasn't that the drug had not been proven to be safe and effective through multiple random-ized, placebo-controlled trials\u2014rather, the adverse drug reactions occurred when patients took the drug for a period of time that was longer than the duration of the clinical trials. A CAM treatment often is based on a much longer historical perspective of safe use in indigenous cultures. 18,19 It may not \"mea- sure up\" in terms of outcome from a short-term placebo-controlled trial, but it may actually provide for both a safer and more effec-tive outcome in the longer term. No long-term, head-to-head out-come studies have been done to compare the safety and effectiveness of speci c CAM therapies to those of pharmaceuti-cally based therapies. 20,21 However, population studies of various diet and lifestyle CAM therapies have shown signi cant improve- ments in health outcomes when compared to populations that have not adopted these habits. 22,23 The recent HALE (Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Europe) project, a 10-year study of health outcomes in individuals aged 70 to 90 years who elected to consume a Mediterranean diet compared to an age- and gender-matched control group in the same countries who consumed their traditional European diet, illustrates this concept. 24 The study reported that \"among individuals aged 70 to 90 years, adherence to a Mediterranean diet and healthful lifestyle is associated with a more than 50% lower rate of all-cause mortality and cause-speci c mortality.\" 24(p1433) Although this study Bausell cri- teria of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, it was published in a peer-reviewed, tier-one journal, and the results have poten-tially significant implications on health outcomes of an aging population. As Ivan Ilich said in his landmark book Medical Nemesis 25 and as suggested by the HALE study, the big break- throughs in health have not occurred through agents developed by the application of the randomized controlled clinical trial to develop new medicines but rather through the effective applica-tion of nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene, all of which were con-sidered \"CAM therapies\" in their time. The question that emerges from Bausell's interpretation of CAM therapies is whether the randomized clinical trial is the appropriate methodology to address the most important ques-tions concerning our health where chronic disease is the dominant form of disease in the developed world. 26 What is emerging is a dif- ferent model for evaluating a therapy's safety and effectiveness that is born out of the developing algorithms of systems biology. 27,28 It uses multivariate, non-parametric statistical methods of analysis of complex data sets. Rather than constructing the experiment to hold all variables constant except the clinical endpoint that is to be 18 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Does CAM Represent Only Placebo Therapies?studied, this model allows the study participants to engage in real- world activities of daily living and then determines how the cap-tured complex data set clusters into patterns of significant outcome. 29,30 Bausell's questioning of the non-placebo validity of all CAM therapies is built on an old model of statistics. It is through the computing power of the 21st century and new technology that pattern recognition and cluster analysis of complex data sets can be routinely accomplished. Work that is being done on the analysis of complex biological systems at places such as the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, has presented an opportunity for new experimental methodologies to be employed in clinical studies. 31 These new meth- ods of analysis don't suffer the \"one agent for one outcome\" bias of the randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The systems biol-ogy approach to medicine is now being seriously discussed as part of the development of an integrated biological approach to health-care. 32 The Institute for Functional Medicine recently published the Textbook of Functional Medicine, which describes a clinical approach to applying systems biology to the management of chronic disease.33 The clinical model described in the textbook is built on a founda-tion of evidence from not only randomized, controlled clinical trials but also studies published from epidemiology, meta-analyses, case-controlled studies, basic science discoveries, and complex data set analyses. The functional medicine approach to chronic disease rep-resents a new paradigm in healthcare that moves beyond the limita-tions of CAM described by Bausell. We are witnessing a new era in which it might be said that we are \"moving back to the future.\" The move back is to explore what makes the greatest impact on improving health outcomes in a soci-ety burdened with the rising incidence of chronic disease from a historical perspective. The future holds the development of new experimental methods of designing studies that can better address complexity within human populations and the computing and sta-tistical methodologies to bring clarity from confusion. 34,35 It is certainly true that all interventions are \"tainted\" by meth- odological issues such as the placebo effect. Some therapies have a much greater likelihood of a strong placebo effect than others, such as those for chronic pain. It is also true that some therapies are much more dif cult to separate methodologically from that of the placebo effect. This is the case with a number of CAM therapies in that it may be virtually impossible to completely blind the par-ticipants or the practitioners or provide a suitable placebo. Using the new experimental methods that are based on complexity theo-ry and systems biology and the statistical methods that support them, we will be better able to address the long-term safety and ef cacy of many CAM therapies. It is through this work that stud- ies will help answer the question of which CAM therapies work via placebo effect and which therapies will aid us in ghting chronic disease and in rmity. 36 REFERENCES 1.

Davis Co; 2001). (Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(2):20-22.) From 2000 to 2004 I had the pleasure and opportunity to write a regular column entitled \"Progress Notes in CAM Education\" for this journal. At the time, exciting new things were happening in the academic world with the evolution of a wide range of educational ini- tiatives in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) edu-cation. I interviewed educators and documented their projects, curricular changes, institutional and cultural challenges, evalua-tion efforts, feedback from learners, funding issues, time and effort, faculty development, and more. A mid-trajectory summa-ry article was published that reviewed the major trends in CAM education at that time. 1 It was during an era when the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was investing more than $21 million in a series of educational enhancement grants in CAM education and many of those columns summarized work that was just starting or underway across the country. We have come a long way since then. In October 2007, Academic Medicine: Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the premier journal for medical educators, published a theme issue comprised of 9 papers summarizing the outcomes, methods, processes, evaluation, and impact of the NCCAM-funded projects. 2,3 This was a high watermark for the eld in that it presented the broad academic medicine community with a solid showing of the state-of-the-art education in CAM and inte-grative medicine (IM). While any one publication or even a theme issue rarely makes a tectonic shift in the methods and cul-ture of academia, the presence of such a theme issue offers us hope that gradual acceptance and integration of the role of CAM/IM training is occurring and that sustainable change is upon us. 4 Indeed, surveys of medical schools continue to show that nearly all of them have some offerings in this area and also that board examinations are increasingly quizzing students on this content. It is, of course, a positive step that ATHM continues to print new research on CAM/IM education, as in this issue. Our col-league Peter Wayne is an established, well-respected CAM educa-tor and researcher. I found his report of developing research capacity at the New England School of Acupuncture in collabora-tion with Harvard's Osher Integrative Medicine Center to be excellent. His pragmatic approach of introducing research skills to his faculty and students, starting with the \"publishable case report,\" clinical research methods and seminar series, required courses on research, as well as electives, is highly innovative and progressive in helping CAM practitioners, faculty, and students become more oriented to the rules of evidence and the methods of scienti c clinical inquiry. This NIH-funded research is doing much to help develop a culture of scholarship and academic rigor in his institutions and is helping to bridge the cultures of conven-tional and CAM researchers. Another promising development is the rapid growth of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. The Consortium is composed of 39 North American academic health science centers that have active programs in at least 2 of the 3 areas of education, clinical care, and/or research in IM. This group started with 8 schools in 1999 and with the generous sup-port of the Bravewell Philanthropic Collaborative has grown to its present size. The mission of the Consortium is as follows: Our mission is to help transform medicine and health- care through rigorous scientific studies, new models of clinical care, and innovative educational programs that integrate biomedicine, the complexity of human beings, the intrinsic nature of healing and the rich diversity of therapeutic systems. With the voice of nearly 30% of US and Canadian medical schools, the Consortium is poised to advocate within academia for a relevant role for IM across all institutional missions. The PROGRESS NOTES UPDATED: THE CONSORTIUM AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION IN COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Victor S. Sierpina, MDguest editorialALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 21 Developments in Education in Complementary and Integrative MedicineConsortium leadership consists of a steering committee member from each of the 39 schools. An executive committee is composed of chair (Victor Sierpina, University of Texas Medical Branch), vice chair (Adam Perlman, University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey), treasurer (John Pan, George Washington University), secretary (Anne Nedrow, Oregon Health Sciences University), and the past chair (Susan Folkman, University of California, San Francisco) and past vice chair (Mary Jo Kreitzer, University of Minnesota), as well as at-large members (Sara Warber, University of Michigan; Roberta Lee, Albert Einstein Medical School; Victoria Maizes, University of Arizona; David Rakel, Bud Rickhi, University of Calgary; Saki Santorelli, University of Massachusetts Medical School). The Consortium has operationalized its mission through its working groups. The Education Working Group, headed by Mary Guerrera from the University of Connecticut and Ron Glick from the University of Pittsburgh is actively involved in several projects, including proposing a change in educational standards to the Licensing Commission for Medical Education (LCME). The pro-posed changes are modi cations of existing standards to include requirements for complementary and integrative medicine content into medical school curricula as well as an exposure to indigenous systems of care. If approved through the LCME's established pro-cess of revising standards, these changes will promote the eld of medical education's efforts for creative and across-the-board incor-poration of CAM/IM concepts and content into the educational programs of all US medical schools. Each school would need to demonstrate that it teaches this material in some way and evalu-ates the results of such teaching in order to be accredited by the LCME. The Education Working Group is also compiling a database of educational resources in CAM/IM education available in the United States and Canada for other centers wishing to access such materials for their own ongoing or nascent programs. Another initiative of this energetic working group is to create presentations about the need, rationale, and resources needed for fostering IM education, which will be presented to educational deans and other educators at the regional General Education Association meetings held as part of the Association of American Medical Colleges annual sessions this spring. Four proposals have been submitted for these regional meetings. The Education Working Group also submitted and had published a letter to the editor of the Journal of Family Practice arguing for incorporating integrative medicine into the design of residency programs. The group is also preparing a viewpoint paper on the changes needed in undergraduate, premedical curriculum in order to introduce premed students to the broad range of perspectives and skills needed to understand and practice integratively. Several member schools (University of Arizona, University of Connecticut, Albert Einstein Medical School, University of Texas Medical Branch), led by University of Arizona Program in Integrative Medicine's Patricia Lebensohn and Victoria Maizes, are developing an Integrative Medicine in Residency curriculum. This pilot started with a 12.5-hour online botanical curriculum and will be launched in July 2008 at 8 pilot family medicine resi-dencies (4 Consortium members) as a 250-hour longitudinal, required curriculum across the 3 years of training. A student leadership committee is being formed to help foster leadership training at the American Medical Student Association. The Clinical Working Group, led by Andy Heyman, an Integrative Fellow from the University of Michigan, and Jillian Capodice, Columbia University, has a number of activities in progress initiated by the previous co-chairs, Mary Hardy from UCLA and John Pan from George Washington University. Eight schools have institutional review board approval, and 4 more are pending to participate in The Outcomes Research Project to examine patient outcomes related to IM. Enrollment is under-way. A new initiative involves joint conference calls with the Society for Integrative Oncology. A pediatric subgroup is also active with monthly conference calls and a number of initiatives in their specialty area. The Clinical Working Group also has developed a Clinical Models Survey, which is an audit of clinical services of Consortium members. This group also is developing the infrastructure for a practice-based research network in col-laboration with the Research Working Group. The Research Working Group, led by Susan Gould Fogerite, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and Laurie Lachance, University of Michigan, is in the process of creating a network of researchers from the various schools to share their expertise and patient populations for recruitment in studies in IM. By developing a membership database with information about research, practice, areas of expertise, and ongoing projects, they anticipate fostering collaboration and mentoring among members. This information also will be used to establish a Rapid Response and Referral Network for responding to questions from the media and providing comment on topics related to CAM and IM. The Research Working Group will be an instrumental part of a number of Consortium and non-Consortium peer reviewers of abstracts submitted for the North American Complementary and Integrative Medicine Research Conference to be held in Minneapolis in May 2009. This conference offers opportunities for researchers from the worldwide CAM community to present their best work on education, clinical, and other research areas in IM. The last conference, held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in May 2006 was an enormous success, with over 700 attendees from 14 countries and hundreds of posters, presentations, theme sessions, and keynotes. We will soon be inviting proposals and encourage you to submit your best work. ATHM published the last conference proceedings. Another vital activity of the Consortium is the policy domain, where our stated goal is to \"inform national policy that advances integrative medicine through research, clinical, and education initiatives.\" Mary Jo Kreitzer of the University of Minnesota is the liaison to the Executive Committee on policy matters. An attractive, informative \"leave behind\" describing the Consortium was developed and is being used to initiate dialogues with legislators, policy makers, and other opinion leaders. We are in the process of developing a process and policies for estab-lishing alliances for collaboration and networking with other organizations in the CAM community, such as the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) and others, 5,6 with arranging bi-annual meetings with NCCAM leadership and developing relationships with campus Government Relations Of cers in member schools. The Consortium is preparing to expand its membership as more activity is clearly evident at other academic centers. We are also seeking to expand our revenue streams from membership dues and new sources of philanthropy and to explore potential business and intellectual property opportunities. For a complete list of member schools and other Consortium information, visit the website at www.imconsortium.org. While the future of IM education is bright, some major chal- lenges and opportunities lie ahead for us to prepare the next gen-eration of integrative medicine practitioners. 7 Among these are 1. faculty development in both conventional and CAM schools regarding the content of the field, teaching methods, and research expertise; 2. transprofessional collaboration in education, research, clinical care, and healthcare policy among IM practitio-ners and colleagues in conventional medicine, allied health, nursing, pharmacy, and CAM disciplines such as chiropractic, massage, naturopathy, indigenous health-care systems, and others; 3. providing learners with critical thinking skills, access to reliable resources, and role modeling of integrative prac-tice in consistent, credible, and relevant ways; 4. outcomes-based practice and optimal care pathways informed by research; and 5. changes in health insurance reimbursement and policy to provide broader access for underserved patients to inte-grative medicine. To forward such an agenda, the Consortium must partner with other CAM organizations and professional educators, deans, and course directors in our medical, nursing, and allied health schools; researchers; health policy and opinion-leaders; patient advocacy groups; and the scienti c community. Together, we can change the world of healthcare. REFERENCES 1. Sierpina V. Progress notes: a review of educational developments in CAM. Altern Ther Health Med. 2002;8(6):112-114. 2.

Wendy Weaver, BA, was the tness coordinator at and Gil Peri, MPH , MBA , was director of the Carillon Wellness Center at St Anthony's Health Care, St Petersburg, when this article was written. Sharon E. Phillips, MSPH , is a biostatistician III in the Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee. Increasing obesity, epidemic rates of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, low-nutrient diets, and lack of activity play key roles in the decline in tness, health, and potential longevity in average Americans. 1-3 Evidence-based lifestyle interventions are indicated to offset this potential decrease in lifespan and health span. Many diet studies have assessed weight loss and lipid response, yet few have combined dietary changes speci cally addressing ber and saturated fat intake with aerobic exercise and strength training and measured their impact on various measures of wellness, in particular, body composition (lean and fat mass), total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (TC:HDL) ratios, strength, fl exibility, maximal rate of oxygen con- sumption (VO 2 max), and cognitive performance. After age 40, steady physiological changes in age occur year- ly, with body fat increasing by 1% and body lean mass decreasing by 1%. These changes are associated with losses in strength and an increased risk for both morbidity and mortality. 4-10 Aerobic t- ness also drops linearly, best noted by a VO2 max decrease of 1% per year after age 40.11,12 Every decade these measures worsen by approximately 10% with normal aging; hence, they appear to be useful measures of wellness. Total cholesterol levels have been suggested to increase lin- early through adulthood until age 70, by approximately 1 mg/dL yearly, with HDL levels changing minimally over this time frame. 13 Studies have shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity decreases with advancing age and appears to be EFFICACY OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES IN MODIFYING PRACTICAL MARKERS OF WELLNESS AND AGING Steven Cameron Masley, MD, FAAFP , CNS ; Wendy Weaver, BA; Gil Peri, MPH , MBA ; Sharon E. Phillips, MSPHoriginal research Purpose To determine the ef cacy of asking people to add ber, exercise, and stress management to their lifestyles to enhance markers of wellness and aging. Methods A 10-week, randomized control study conducted in a wellness center in St Petersburg, Florida. Participants were adults aged 21 to 65 years who exercised fewer than 3 days per week. Fifty-six subjects were randomized to a control or an intervention group. Subjects followed a diet with >30 g of ber and <16 g of saturated fat daily and were taught to reach 70% to 85% of their maximum heart rate 5 to 6 days per week and to perform strength training 3 days per week. They were also asked to participate in 10 to 20 minutes of stress management activities daily. The study was designed to determine changes in body composition, maxi-mal rate of oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (TC:HDL) ratio, and cognition. Results Initial analyses with analysis of variance (ANOV A) com- paring the intervention group to the control group showed signi - cant improvements in TC:HDL (8.9% average; P=.02) and change in weight (2.3 kg average; P=.016). When the groups were com- pared, the improvements in cognitive fl exibility and VO 2 max with ANOV A were not signi cant ( P=.17 and P=.11, respectively). Additional independent t tests showed decreases in TC:HDL 8.9% ( P=.02) and TC of 7.3% ( P=.001) for the intervention group compared to the control group. A mean increase of 29% in VO2 max of intervention subjects who exercised aerobically for at least 30 minutes 5 days/week was signi cant ( P=.02) compared to the control group. Over the 10 weeks, the control group showed no signi cant change in lipids, body composition, cognition, and tness, whereas the intervention group showed decreased body mass index (BMI) of 0.72 ( P=.02), weight loss of 2.3 kg P=.016), and decreased body fat of 1.6% ( P<.0001). In the intervention group, those with a BMI >24 who exercised 5 to 6 days/week lost 4.8 kg and 4.1 kg in body fat. Also, in the intervention group, several of the cognitive scores showed statistically signi cant improvements from baseline: mental speed but none of these cognitive changes was signi cant with indepen- dent t testing when compared to the control group. Conclusions A diet high in ber and low in saturated fat combined with strength training, aerobic activity, and stress management activities improves tness and several markers of wellness and aging. ( Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(2):24-29.)ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 25 Modifying Practical Markers of Wellness and Agingassociated with an increase in LDL and TC levels without impact- ing HDL levels.14-16 As the TC:HDL ratio is easy to measure and has been shown to be one of the best predictors for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), 17 this makes the TC:HDL a practi- cal predictor of CVD and potentially a useful marker of health. Lastly, cognitive function as measured by reaction time, mental speed, and cognitive fl exibility also has been suggested to decrease linearly over time. 18-20 Enhancing cognitive function would likely also be important in improving overall productivity. Hence, various outcome markers exist that are potential physio-logical measures of wellness and can be used to assess the ef cacy of various lifestyle interventions. Our hypothesis was that combining aerobic activity and strength training with a diet emphasizing high ber and low sat-urated fat intake plus a stress-management component could improve cholesterol pro les, body composition, strength, aero-bic tness, fl exibility, and cognitive performance. METHODS St Anthony's Hospital's institutional review board approved this protocol, and all subjects gave written informed consent to participate. Subjects 21 to 65 years of age, enrolled in a wellness center in St Petersburg, Florida, and exercising fewer than 3 days per week were invited to participate. Our aim in enrolling well-ness center members who were not using the facilities regularly was to nd subjects willing to participate in a study assessing markers of tness and wellness with a diet and exercise regimen; these subjects would be similar to average Americans in terms of body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, and tness. At entry the subject's average BMI was 28.9, daily ber intake was 15 g with 22 g of saturated fat, and VO 2 max was 41.3, compared to national American averages of 26.6 BMI,1 ber intake of 15.6 g,2 saturated fat intake of 27.9 g,3 and VO2 max of 38.5.4 Fifty-six subjects were ranked by BMI to help ensure similar BMI and tness levels at entry and randomized to either a control or an intervention group for 10 weeks. At entry there was no sta-tistical difference in BMI; gender distribution; age distribution; or TC:HDL ratio, TC, or HDL lev- els between the control and intervention groups (Table 1). Members of the control group were asked to continue their current dietary intake and activity level for 10 weeks, and in addi-tion to the listed outcome measures, their dietary intake was assessed with NutriBase 5 software (CyberSoft Inc, Phoenix, Arizona) at entry and end of the study. After the study was complet-ed, control subjects were invited to participate in the intervention. The intervention program participants were taught by a nutritionist and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)-certi ed exercise instructors during weekly lectures in a group set- ting using meal plans and recipes for a diet with >30 g of ber and <16 g of saturated fat daily. They were encouraged to reach 70% to 85% of their maximum achieved heart rate 5 to 6 days per week for 30 minutes and to perform strength training 3 days per week with 1 to 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions for 10 body movements to smooth-motion lifting exhaustion for a total of 10 weeks. The emphasis upon adding ber and decreasing saturated fat has been described previously. 21 In addition, intervention subjects were encouraged to create 10 to 20 minutes each day for mentally calm-ing activities, such as meditation, breathing activities taught in a yoga class, or enjoying a hot bath by candlelight with soft music. Outcome measures included body composition, strength and fl exibility, VO 2 max, TC:HDL ratios, and cognitive function. Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance (Tanita\u00ae TBF-310, Tanita Corp of America, Inc, Arlington Heights, Illinois). Strength and fl exibility data were collected using instruc- tions from sit-and-reach fl exibility. 22 VO2 max was predicted from peak MET (exercise measure of metabolic equivalent) and heart-rate levels achieved during a treadmill test using the Bruce proto-col\u2014a standardized multistage treadmill test for assessing cardiovascular health\u2014with Physiologic\u00ae software (KI Software, Silver Spring, Maryland). TC and HDL were measured with Cholestech\u00ae (Cholestech Corp, Hayward, California) using refl ec- tance photometry to measure the amount of cholesterol fractions in the blood, which is converted to a mg/dL measurement. At entry and following the 10-week intervention, neurocognitive per-formance was assessed using a computerized battery, CNS Vital Signs\u00ae (CNS Vital Signs, LLC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina). This test battery is self-administered in 30 minutes on a PC and includes tests of visual and verbal memory, nger tapping, sym- bol digit coding, the Stroop test, shifting attention, and continu-ous performance. The 7 tests generate domain scores for memory, psychomotor speed, information processing time, attention, and cognitive fl exibility. The tests in the CNS Vital Signs battery are standardized and are known to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to TABLE 1 Demographic Data of Subjects at Entry* Measures Mean (SD)Control Group (N=28)Intervention Group (N=28) P values Gender (% male) 39.3% 53.6% \u2014 Age 43.5 (11.2) 47.1 (9.4) \u2014Years of education 16.3 15.8 0.79BMI 28.6 (6.6) 29.3 (6.2) 0.71Body fat percentage 30.8% (8.8) 33.0% (9.4) 0.37TC:HDL ratio 4.2 (1.5) 4.5 (1.7) 0.58VO 2 max 41.4 (12.0) 41.2 (9.3) oxygen consumption.26 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Modifying Practical Markers of Wellness and Agingvery small changes in neurocognitive performance.5-8 Dietary adherence was measured using NutriBase 5\u00ae soft- ware, analyzing 3-day food intake records with 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day at entry and after 10 weeks to assess dietary changes. Subjects were asked to calculate their ber and saturat-ed fat intake 1 day per week using provided tables. Activity lev-els and stress-management activities were reported verbally weekly with an exercise physiologist who recorded frequency and intensity of strength training and aerobic activity and whether subjects participated in calming activities for 10 to 20 minutes daily over each week. Power calculations were performed to determine the sample size, such that an independent t test would be based on a power of 0.85 to detect a signi cant difference ( P=.05, 2-sided) based on projected changes in the measures for BMI, the TC:HDL ratio, and percentage of body fat from previous pilot studies, resulting in a requirement of 23 patients per group. After allowing for a 20% dropout rate, we planned to enroll 28 patients per group. We did not have data to assess sample size for changes in strength, cognitive performance, or VO 2 max; hence, the primary outcome measures would be changes in TC:HDL, BMI, and body fat. Secondary measures would be changes in strength, VO 2 max, and cognitive performance. ANOV A was used to compare the intervention group with the control group for changes in TC:HDL, weight, cognitive fl exibility, and VO 2 max. Between-group and within-group differences were tested using independent and paired t tests. Weight change was ana- lyzed for both groups and for overweight subjects (BMI >24, which is the cut-off for normal weight) in each group. Likewise, TC:HDL changes were measured in both groups and for group subjects who started with a TC:HDL >4.8, which is considered abnormal by some national commercial laboratories. Diet and exercise compliance was assessed using the weekly data collected by the exercise physiologists and analyzed. Of the initial 28 inter-vention subjects, 1 dropped out at the beginning because of a family emergency, and the remaining 27 completed the study. Of the 28 control subjects, 2 dropped out immediately for personal reasons, and 6 were unwilling to complete testing at the end of 10 weeks. Hence, 27 of 28 intervention and 20 of 28 control sub-jects completed the study. RESULTS Over the 10 weeks, the control group showed no signi cant change in BMI, total weight, body fat percentage, TC:HDL ratio, VO 2 max, or cognitive performance as assessed by mental speed, reaction time, and cognitive fl exibility. ANOV A comparing the intervention group to the control group showed significant changes in weight loss, an average of 2.3 kg ( P=.016, standard error 5.6), an average 8.9% improvement in the TC:HDL ratio (P=.02, standard error 1.1), and non-signi cant changes in cog- nitive flexibility ( P=.17, standard error 12.1) and VO 2 max (P=.11, standard error 9.5). Compared to the control group over 10 weeks with an inde- pendent test, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in BMI (0.72, P=.02), weight (2.3 kg, P=.016), and per- centage of body fat (1.6%, P<.0001), without a loss in lean mass with an independent t test. The 16 control subjects with a BMI >24 at entry noted a 0.2-kg decrease in weight ( P=.7); however, their body fat increased 0.6%. In contrast, the 20 intervention subjects with a BMI >24 noted a 2.3-kg weight loss ( P=.001) with a 1.7% decrease in body fat. Finally, the 7 in the intervention group with a BMI >24 and who exercised at least 5 to 6 days per week lost 4.3 kg in body weight and 4.1 kg in body fat ( P=.009), which represents a 2.6% decrease in body fat and a 12.8% loss in their total fat mass (Figure 1). The intervention group also showed an 8.9% decrease in TC:HDL ( P=.02) and a TC ( P=.001). Although not statistically signi cant, in subjects who had abnormally ele-vated TC:HDL levels at entry (>4.8), there was an 11.7% (5.97 to 6.73) increase in the 7 control subjects and a 12.7% (6.26 to 5.46) decrease in 10 intervention subjects (Figure (kg) Fat Mass Loss (kg) FIGURE 1 Changes in Weight and Fat Mass Over 10 Weeks as Measured With Bioelectrical Impedance 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 04.24.666.7 4.54.16.3 5.5 Control Group 14.3% increase in TC:HDL >4.8 16.7% in at TC:HDL post-10 weeks FIGURE 2 Changes in the TC:HDL Ratio Over 10 WeeksTK ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 27With a paired t test and following ACSM methods, the inter- vention group noted a 91% increase in the number of curl-ups they could do, (44.7 to 85.7, P<.0001); a 79% increase in the number of push-ups they could do (10.1 to 18.1, P<.0001); and a 30% increase in sit-and-reach fl exibility (20.1 cm to 26.2 cm, P=.0008) over the 10 weeks (Figure 3). Strength and fl exibility testing was used as part of the intervention and not tested in the control group. The mean increase of 17% in VO 2 max in the intervention group was not different ( P=.11) from the control group. After comparing only intervention subjects who exercised aerobically for at least 30 minutes 5 to 6 days per week (n=13), the mean 29% increase in VO 2 max in the intervention subjects was signif- icant ( P=.02) compared to the control group (Figure 4). In the intervention group, increasing ber intake to >30 g daily com-pared to an intake of <30 g also was associated with an increase in VO2 max ( P<.0001). This study did not show a statistically signi cant difference in cognitive function by independent t testing when comparing the intervention and control groups. For within-group compari-sons, there were no statistically signi cant changes in the con-trol group from baseline to follow-up. Of interest within the intervention group is that several of the cognitive scores showed statistically significant improvements from baseline: mental speed (4.6%, were not signi cant (45%, P=.18, Table 2). Hence, there is a non-signi cant trend for cognitive improvement for mental speed, reaction time, and cognitive flexibility in the intervention group, and further studies with larger samples sizes are warranted. In the intervention group, 70% of the subjects reached at least 30 g of ber daily, 78% decreased their saturated fat intake to <16 g daily, 48% exercised in their aerobic heart rate range at least 5 to 6 days per week, and 56% engaged in strength training at least 3 days per week. As evidenced by the average nutritional intake with the NutriBase 5 software, no significant changes occurred in the control group. The intervention group reported a calorie intake decrease from 1898 kcal to 1511, a ber intake increase from 15 to 28 g daily, and a saturated fat intake decrease from 22 to 11 g daily. In comparing whether adherence to the various aspects of the program (dietary change, activity change, or stress management) achieved signi cant reduction in these objective measures of well- ness and aging, we compared the results of the intervention group who adhered to each intervention against those who did not with paired t tests. Participating in exercise 5 to 6 days per week appeared the most important, followed by increasing ber intake, adding strength training, and reducing saturated fat intake. Adding stress management activities (as de ned by creating peace- ful time daily) did not impact the nal outcome measures. DISCUSSION This intervention combined dietary changes, activity rec- ommendations, and stress management and then gauged basic outcome measures that refl ect tness and markers for wellness and aging. Five areas were assessed, including changes in body fat, strength, aerobic tness, cholesterol, and cognitive perfor-mance. Signi cant improvements were seen in the rst 4 of these areas, and a trend toward improvement was seen in 3 of the 5 domains of cognitive function that were assessed in this study. The weight loss noted in this study as a result of adding the recommended extra 250 kcal in exercise daily (350 calories x 5 days per week) and decreasing caloric intake by 350 calories would have been expected to decrease body weight by 5.4 kg. This is close to the 4.8-kg weight loss noted in the study in those who were adherent and overweight. Overall, the focus on adding at least 30 g of ber daily gained wide adherence and may have added to the success of this intervention.

Strength tests used in this inter-vention with charts from the ACSM provide comparisons of results to gender- and age-speci c groups. The TC:HDL ratio is perhaps the best predictor of risk for cardiovascular disease and can be measured easily in a non-fasting state at health fairs, clinics, and tness centers across the country, often for free or for a nominal fee. The improvement noted in TC:HDL is similar to that in previ-ous studies. 23 Fitness centers and medical professionals across the country provide body composition testing with skin-fold testing, and electrical impedance testing is becoming increasingly com-mon. Aerobic tness testing can be performed in a medical facility when warranted and also can be assessed in almost any tness cen- ter that has treadmill machines. Of these tests, only cognitive test-ing is not yet practical on a large scale without medical referral and interpretation, but it too is being used increasingly as a screening test for cognitive decline and cognitive performance. The adherence rate to most aspects of this intervention was good and at least comparable with other studies seeking to change lifestyle behaviors. 24,25 The dietary changes outlined were the easi- est to follow, with >70% adherence; the ability to reach 5 to 6 days per week of aerobic activity was the most dif cult but reached 48% adherence. However, the greatest bene t in terms of loss in fat mass, gains in cognitive performance, and improvements in cho-lesterol pro les occurred in those who exercised at least 5 to 6 days per week. These ndings support results from the National Weight Loss Registry, which has noted daily activity to be the best predic-tor of maintaining weight loss long term 26; however, caution is war- ranted with this comparison as further studies are needed to con rm that the short-term results obtained in this trial can be sustained in long-term clinical trials.LIMITATIONS Though study subjects are typically more motivated than the average American, thus limiting the applicability of the results, this group of subjects at entry showed similar fiber intake, saturated fat intake, tness levels, and BMI to that of most Americans. Also, the fact that the randomized control group showed no signi cant improvements in weight, body fat percentage, aerobic tness, eating habits, or TC:HDL ratios sug-gests that this group was not overly motivated. The majority of subjects in this trial had completed college, were Caucasian, and were free of serious medical conditions; hence, additional studies on subjects with varied education levels and ethnicity would be needed before these results can be applied to the general public. As is done in most wellness programs, entry results were shared with subjects in the control and the intervention groups. Although sharing results adds the potential for bias, it permitted a realistic look at the ef cacy of this type of intervention in typical wellness centers, and as no signi cant changes occurred in the control group, the study results do not appear to have been biased. We acknowledge that it would have been preferable to mea- sure VO 2 max directly rather than estimating it and to assess detailed lipid pro les and other more advanced measures of cardio- vascular disease risk, including C-reactive protein levels; however, these additional outcome measures were beyond the scope of this initial study. We noted an apparent improvement in VO 2 max in subjects who increased their ber intake, but this study was not designed or powered to distinguish between bene ts from exercise and bene ts from nutritional intake. Although it is plausible that more optimal nutritional intake could improve VO 2 max indepen- dent of exercise, further studies are warranted to assess this nding.

Measures were taken to standardize hydration, caffeine, exercise, alcohol, and time-of-day factors that infl uence hydration and body composition measures. The dropout rate in the control group did limit the analyses in this study but fell within the allowable overall rate for our sample size calculations. However, many members of the control group who declined to complete their nal evaluation noted that their status had worsened from the starting time in late September to completion in mid-December and that they did not want to document their deterioration. Therefore, their inclu-sion likely would have enhanced the outcome for the interven-tion group rather than detracted from the results. CONCLUSION A 10-week lifestyle program with a diet emphasizing high ber intake (>30 g daily) and <16 g of saturated fat daily (which are consistent with USDA recommendations) combined with strength training 2 to 3 times per week, aerobic activity 5 to 6 days per week, and stress management improves multiple mea-sures of wellness and aging. These enhancements, compared to a randomized control group, include TC:HDL ratios, VO 2 max per- formance, body fat mass loss, strength gains, and flexibility gains. This intervention program can also be associated with gains in cognitive performance. Although this combination of recommendations requires fur- ther study, an approach that focuses on implementing a combination of ber, aerobic activity, strength training, and stress management achieves multiple improvements in wellness and aging.

After ingestion of a single dose containing 900 mg of elemental calcium, no signi cant differences were observed in AUC suggesting that bioavailability of all four Supplements is similar. However, there were signi cant differences between the groups in the maximum concentration (Cmax), time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) and half-life of elimination. Supplement A showed the maximum increase in serum calcium concentration compared to baseline followed by Supplements B, C and D. Time required to reach the maximum serum concentration was shortest for Supplement D followed by Supplements C, A and B. This suggests that absorption of Supplement D is better compared to the other Supplements. However, the half-life of Supplement D in serum was shortest suggesting that it is cleared from the blood faster than the other Supplements. Supplement B had the longest half-life and seems to be most bioavailable followed by supplement A, C and D.

Although more prevalent in older women, older men and younger individuals also get the disease. The cost of treating osteoporosis and the fractures it causes is estimated to be $1.3 billion each year in Canada. Given the increasing proportion of older people in the population over the next few years, these costs, as well as the number of individuals with osteoporosis, will likely rise. Adequate calcium intake is necessary for bone remodeling to take place in healthy individuals. In older adults adequate calcium intake can slow bone loss and lower the risk of fracture (Lin and Lane, 2004). Furthermore, calcium supplementation is an important part of the medical management of osteoporosis in combination with various prescription medications. Calcium bioavailability is important when calcium intakes are low, or when an individual is growing or losing bone (Fairweather-Tait and Teucher, 2002). Calcium absorption is dependent on many dietary and environmental factors, including the level of protein, sodium, caffeine, vitamin D, fructose and phosphorous in the body. Furthermore, one's genetic makeup, including the vitamin D receptor genotype, may also play a role in calcium absorption (Dawson-Hughes et al., 1995). Supplementation with various calcium preparations is now the most common approach to increase calcium intake in individuals concerned with osteoporosis. However, it has been shown that the bioavailabilities of many commercial calcium preparations are different (Fairweather-Tait and Teucher, 2002). The most common calcium supplement, calcium carbonate, is known to be generally well absorbed but other calcium forms, such as citrate, malate and amino acid chelate, have shown superior ef cacy in some studies (Sakhaee et al., 1999, Heaney et al., 1990). Objective MethodsThe objective of this study was to compare in healthy individuals the bioavailability of calcium from four separate calcium-containing products. This information will increase the overall knowledge of these compounds. The calcium treatments are identi ed in the following table:Individuals were studied for a total of approximately 5 weeks. All subjects were studied as outpatients. The screening process consisted of CBC count, platelets, electrolytes, glucose, BUN, creatinine, liver function tests, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, PT/PTT, and urinalysis. Women of childbearing age also had a urine pregnancy test. Subjects were asked questions to determine present health and past medical history and underwent a brief physical exam. Those deemed eligible after the screening process were asked to return for the four supplementation days. On the rst supplementation day, subjects were randomized for receiving the four supplements in a random order. Blood was taken immediately before supplement administration and 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours after the dose. Standard low calcium meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner, were provided immediately after the dose, following the 4-h blood sample and following the 9-h blood sample, respectively. Each individual was given 6 capsules containing a total of 900 mg of elemental calcium. This dose of elemental calcium is within the RDI recommended by the United States National Institutes of Health (United States National Institutes of Health 1994. Optimal calcium intake. NIH Consensus Statement, V ol. 12, No. 4. 31 pp.) Each subject returned three more times for supplementation with the identical level of elemental calcium in an alternative form. Each visit was separated by a minimum of 1 week. The identical food was supplied to the subjects on each supplementation day. Blood levels of calcium were determined at each time point. Blood: Peripheral blood was taken by venipuncture prior to baseline to determine overall health. Blood was subsequently taken at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours following each supplementation for measurement of calcium in the blood serum. The study design is summarized in the following gure: The data presented in the following table show the changes between the groups in serum calcium concentrations at all the time points after oral supplementation. It was observed that supplementation with A, B and C elevated the serum calcium levels from baseline. A signi cant difference from baseline within the Supplement A, B and C-treated groups was observed for all time points except for 0.5 hours. Also in the Supplement B-treated group at 2 hours there was no signi cant difference from baseline. No Signi cant difference was observed in the Supplement D-treated group.ResultsStudy Outline The participants, clinical assistants and those assessing the outcome were blinded to the group assignment.

North Main StreetClearfield, Utah 84015USA (801) 773-4631The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis for serum calcium concentrations demonstrated that the AUC0 -12h values were similar for all four Supplements and there was no signi cant difference. It was observed that supplementation with different calcium preparations led to different serum concentrations suggesting a difference in absorption. A signi cant difference in the maximum concentration of serum calcium (Cmax) was observed between Supplement D and Supplement B groups and also between Supplement D and Supplement C groups (Figure 2) It was observed that the half-life of elimination was similar for Supplement A and B, but substantially shorter for Supplement D.In the present study, the pharmacokinetic characteristics and bioavailability of four calcium components were investigated. It was observed that all the supplements had a poor bioavailabiity as suggested by the low values for AUC. This could be due to the elimination of the majority of the supplement after the rst pass through the liver. The results demonstrated that an oral administration of Supplement B (900 mg dose) led to more bioavailable calcium compared to the other three supplements. Remarkably little is known about the relative ef cacy of amino acid chelates of calcium. In the only commonly cited trial, absorption was measured for an amino acid chelate called calcium bisglycinate and compared with absorption from citrate, carbonate, and MCHC (Heaney, et al., 1990). In that trial, the amino acid chelate showed the best absorption and MCHC the worst. Although CCM was studied in that trial, it was taken under different circumstances than the chelate (with meals), so drawing de nitive conclusions is not possible. In this study, Dicalcium malate was found to be more bioavailable than the amino acid chelate form of calcium with almost similar absorption but with Dicalcium malate having a longer half-life. The present study was undertaken to compare the bioavailability of calcium after supplementation with four preparations. It was observed that the calcium present in the four Supplements is absorbed and is bioavailable in humans and can be detected in serum after ingestion of a single dose containing 900 mg of elemental calcium. All the Supplements had a poor bioavailabiity as suggested by the low values for AUC. This is likely due to substantial rst-pass elimination. Based on the results of this study, Supplement B seems to be most bioavailable than other Supplements with a longer half-life followed by Supplement A, C and D.

Low back pain poses a major economic burden to society and to employers. 1,2 Back pain is common, and in gen- eral, prognosis is good, with 60% to 70% of patients recovering within 6 weeks. 3 However, the largest per- centage of the costs of back pain, including the more than $28 billion (1998 USD) in productivity losses (which infl ated to 2007 USD is more than $36 billion), is concentrated in the small percentage of patients with chronic low back pain. 1,4 Conventional treatments for chronic low back pain have been found to be expensive and ineffective.1,5 Consequently, a signi cant number of patients have turned to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). One survey of patients eligible for insurance cov-erage for CAM found that 55% of low back pain patients had at least 1 visit to a CAM provider in the study year, and 43% used only CAM for their back pain. 6 Whereas chiropractic is the most com- mon type of CAM used for low back pain,5,6 other CAM therapies also seem effective.7 In particular, acupuncture has shown promise as part of a package of care for low back pain.8 This study is an economic evaluation carried out alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of naturopathic care (includ-ing acupuncture) vs a standardized physiotherapy education regi-men for low back pain in a population of warehouse workers. METHODS In the trial, workers aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagno- sis of low back pain of at least 6 weeks' duration and who were not on sick leave were recruited from a warehouse site of a large North American corporation. After informed consent, 75 who were eligi-ble (Figure 1) were randomly assigned (via observed coin toss) to receive 3 months of 30-minute semi-weekly onsite naturopathic care visits (acupuncture, exercise and dietary advice, relaxation training, and a back care educational booklet 9,10) or 3 months of 30-minute bi-weekly onsite control group visits (standardized physiotherapy advice and the back care educational booklet). COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF NATUROPATHIC CARE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN Patricia M. Herman, ND, MSc, PhD Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness of naturopathic care (acupuncture, relaxation exercises, exercise and dietary advice, and a back care booklet) compared to standardized phys-iotherapy education and a back care booklet (control treatment) for low back pain in a sample (N=70) of warehouse workers.Design Economic evaluation based upon the results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to determine the cost- effectiveness of naturopathic care to society as a whole, to the employer, and to participants.Results Naturopathic care (as compared to the control treat- ment) signi cantly improved quality-adjusted life-years over care also signi cantly reduced societal costs by $1212 per participant. From the perspective of the employer, the intervention cost $154 per absentee day avoided (compared to employer costs of lost productivity of $172 per day) and had a return on investment of 7.9% under the healthcare coverage limits set by this employer and assuming the employer paid the full cost of naturopathic care. Participants experienced savings in adjunctive care of $1096 per participant.Conclusions This economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized control trial shows naturopathic care to be more cost-effective than a standardized physiotherapy education regimen in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Further studies of the economic impact of naturopathic medicine are warranted. ( Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(2):32-39.)ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 33 Naturopathic Care for Chronic Low Back PainStudy participants in both groups were told to continue their usual pain medications as needed, and this usage was monitored. Participants' use of other adjunctive care (chiropractic care, mas-sage, and physiotherapy) was also monitored but not guided in any way by the study. The study was approved by the McMaster University Research Ethics Board, and more detail on the study design is available in Szczurko et al. 11 The cost-effectiveness of naturopathic care over the control intervention is calculated for 3 perspectives: societal, employer, and participant. Because the cost-effectiveness of this intervention to the employer and to participants depends on coverage limits and the resulting allocation of healthcare costs (both of which can vary widely across employers), the main perspective for this study is societal. The effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ ), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and a visual analog scale for pain has been established. 11 Here effectiveness for the societal and participants' perspectives is measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained over 6 months (3-month treatment period plus 3-month follow-up). The algorithm devised by Brazier et al, 12 a sin- gle index measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL)\u2014the SF-6D\u2014is used to calculate QALYs for each participant at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months from responses to the SF-36 at each of these time points. Total change in QALYs is calculated as the area under the SF-6D score curve over the 6-month study period. Cost-effectiveness to the employer is calcu-lated in terms of cost per day of absenteeism reduced and return on investment. Given the short time horizon, neither costs nor effects are discounted. Absenteeism was not directly measured in this study. However, because productivity losses are such a large portion of the cost of low back pain, 1 changes in absenteeism are estimated using the change in the RDQ. A search of the literature revealed several recent randomized controlled trials of various interventions for low back pain that measured both days lost from work and the RDQ. A study by Moffett et al 13 proved the best match in terms of average baseline RDQ levels (6.65 for the treatment group and 5.56 for controls), the intervention tested (exercise classes added to routine general practi-tioner care), and sample size (N=183). This study also provided the most conservative estimate of absentee days reduced per 1-point reduction (improvement) in the RDQ of 2.32 days per 1-point reduction in the RDQ maintained over 1 year. Costs are reported in 2005 US dollars. The patients themselves reported their use of back pain-related adjunctive care at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months via 1-week diaries. 14 Unfortunately, the unit cost of each type of adjunctive care was not recorded, and published sources of these costs (other than medica-tion costs) are sparse. Therefore, the unit costs and resource use are reported separately to enable decision makers facing different costs to adjust the study's results. As shown in Table 1, the best available source for unit price data for naturopathic care, massage, and phys-iotherapy was the national association for each type of practice. Published sources were available to value chiropractic care, 15 over- the-counter and prescription drugs, and productivity losses.16 Published guidelines for the treatment of low back pain gener- ally consist of patient education and reassurance, discouragement Screened for eligibility (n=84) Not randomized (n=9)Not able to commit time (n=3) No pain at assessment (n=2) Pregnant (n=2)Previous spinal surgery (n=1)Too late in accepting enrollment (n=1) Randomized after informed consent (n=75) Control (n=36) Naturopathic care (n=39) Month 1 (n=39) Month (n=39)Month 3 (n=37)Month 2 (n=23) (n=31) Month (n=32)Follow-up Month 6 (n=8)Crossover Month 4 (n=13)Dropped out (n=5)Dissatisfaction with care (n=2)Unable to commit time (n=3) FIGURE 1 Flowchart of Subjects Through the Randomized Controlled Trial34 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Naturopathic Care for Chronic Low Back Painof bed rest and recommendations for a gradual increase in activity, referral for exercise therapy (especially for chronic low back pain), and pain medication. 17 Participants on prescription medications were assumed to manage those with their regular conventional phy-sician. Visits to conventional physicians for prescription manage-ment or for non-back pain-related conditions were not assumed to vary between groups and were not tracked. The study naturopathic physicians provided both the naturopathic and control group care. In the real world, low back pain patients would not likely seek out naturopathic physicians to obtain physiotherapy advice at the exclu-sion of other naturopathic care. Therefore, the time the control group spent with the naturopathic physicians is valued at the cost of a physiotherapy visit. To account for the protocol-related time spent by both groups (informed consent and data collection), only half of the 1-hour screening visit (where histories were taken and initial exams performed) will be counted and a total of 45 minutes (15 minutes per data collection cycle times 3 cycles) will be subtracted from practitioner time for each group. This analysis follows an intent-to-treat principle for partici- pants who received at least 1 treatment, and missing data are han-dled using carry-forward imputation. Because the distribution of cost data tends to be highly skewed, bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap estimates are used to determine con dence intervals for mean differences in costs (1000 replications). 18 The bootstrapped societal cost-QALY pairs are also graphically represented on a cost-effectiveness plane. 19 Uncertainty in an economic evaluation comes not just from sample variation, but also from the assumptions made that can affect generalizability. 20 In order to test the robustness of study results, a univariate sensitivity analysis is conducted. The use of each resource is varied over its 95% con dence interval range (Table 2), and in the absence of better data, the unit price of each resource shown in Table 1 is varied from 50% to 150% its value. In discus-sions with practitioners, these ranges are possible, especially if they are allowed to also capture variation in the length and intensity of each visit. The absenteeism estimate has 3 sources of uncertainty: labor costs, RDQ scores, and the change in absentee days for each point change in RDQ. Labor costs will be varied the same way other unit costs are varied, and RDQ scores are varied over their 95% confidence interval. The change in absentee days for each point change in RDQ is varied from a low of 0 days per RDQ point (essentially setting absenteeism to 0) to the higher rate seen in Kovacs et al 21 of 3.59 days per 1-point change in the RDQ. All calcu- lations are made using Microsoft Excel 2003 SP1 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). RESULTS The 75 workers were randomized to naturopathic care (n=39) or to a standardized physiotherapy education regimen (control group care; n=36). Overall, 68 patients (91%) had use-able data for the 12-week treatment period, and 32 (82%) of the naturopathic care group and 8 (22%) of the control group had week 26 follow-up data (Figure 1). The primary reason why the response rate for the control group at week 26 is so low is because both groups were offered the opportunity to receive crossover care for 4 weeks after the treatment period ended (between week 12 and week 16) as an incentive for retention during the treat-ment period. Thirteen of the control group participants elected to receive crossover naturopathic treatment and were no longer able to represent control group outcomes at follow-up. No partic-ipants in the naturopathic care group elected to receive crossover control group care. At baseline, minor differences in characteris-tics are seen between the full treatment and control groups (Table 3). Baseline characteristics for the control group participants with available 6-month data are also shown in Table 3 to aid in the interpretation of that portion of the sensitivity analysis, which is discussed below. Resource use for the study treatments (net of protocol-related hours), adjunctive care visits and medication, and estimated absenteeism days (all net of baseline) are reported in Table 2.

Conversely, control group participants tended to increase adjunctive care (except for medi-cations) and have slightly increased absenteeism. No participant reported adjunctive use of acupuncture. Table 2 also reports HRQoL as measured by the SF-6D. The naturopathic care group experienced a statistically signi cant ( P=.006) increase in QALYs over the 6-month study period, but the control group did not (Table 3). The difference between groups in QALY gains was sta-tistically signi cant ( P=.036). The estimated mean health gain is 0.0256 QALYs, which is equivalent to 9.4 \"perfect health\" days or to taking average participants' health (measured by the SF-6D as approximately 70% health at baseline, Table 2) to \"perfect health\" for 31 days over the 6-month period. The mean incremental cost to society of naturopathic care is estimated to be -$1212 (a net savings of $1212) per participant (Table 4). Figure 2 shows the cost-utility plane for the societal perspective. The graph represents 1000 bootstrap replications of the relationship between incremental societal costs and incre-mental QALY gains. All cost-effect pairs (100%) are in the bottom right quadrant, suggesting that naturopathic care is dominant over the control treatment (a standardized physiotherapy educa-tion regimen)\u2014that is, the use of naturopathic care instead of the control treatment is associated with both an improvement in HRQoL and lower costs. Under these assumptions and in this population, naturopathic care is a cost-effective alternative to standardized physiotherapy education. As discussed previously, the portion of these savings that accrues to the employer (through reductions in medical costs, if self-insured, and productivity losses avoided) and the portion that accrues to participants (through out-of-pocket costs avoid- ed) depend upon the coverage limits speci ed. Table 4 reports the breakdown of adjunctive care costs between the employer and the participant based on employer coverage of 80% of costs up to $400 annually for chiropractic care and massage and up to $1000 for physiotherapy. Medications were covered by this employer at various rates from 0% to 80% with no maximum. Under these assumptions, the majority of the savings due to reductions in adjunctive care accrue to participants as reductions in their out-of-pocket costs. The other cost that must be allocated before cost-effectiveness to the employer and to the participant can be determined is the cost of treatment. In this study participants in both groups received their treatment at no cost. The employer covered all Naturopathic Care for Chronic Low Back PainTABLE 4 Costs (Net of Baseline) and Quality-adjusted Life-years* Costs Naturopathic care (n=39) Control (n=31) indicates bias corrected and accelerated Costs Incremental QALYs FIGURE 2 Cost Effectiveness Plane for Societal Costs and Quality-adjusted Life-year (QALY) Gains for Naturopathic Care Compared to the Control Treatment (a standardized physiotherapy regimen) Over 6 Months ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 37 Naturopathic Care for Chronic Low Back PainTABLE 5 Sensitivity Analysis* Sensitivity analysis scenarios Naturopathic care (n=39) Control (n=31) -$1058) Analysis using only indicates bias corrected and accelerated 95% con care (n=32), control (n=8).\u00a795% standard error-based con dence costs. Free onsite naturopathic treatment may not neces- sarily be continued, however, and it should be noted that some of the attractiveness to participants of naturopathic care on this study (possibly affecting retention and outcomes) may have been due to its accessibility and lack of cost. Assuming that the employer pays all costs of treatment, naturopathic care is cost-effective for participants, with savings in out-of-pocket adjunctive care costs of $1096 and an increase in QALYs of 0.0256. Employer costs of $1025 ($1132 less $107, assuming the employer would also have paid for the control treatment) are compared to a net reduction in absenteeism days of 6.7 (95% CI: -4.8, -8.6) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the employer of $154 per absentee day avoided. If employer costs per absentee day are $172 ($21.44 per hour times 8 hours) as assumed in this analysis, then under the assumptions of this study, offering naturopathic care is a cost-effective alterna-tive to standardized physiotherapy education to employers. Comparing an investment of $1469 for naturopathic care per participant to a return of $1585 ($337 + $107 + $1141) gives a return on investment over the 6 months of 7.9%. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the incremental societal cost savings shown in this study are robust to widely differing cost and resource use assumptions. Varying each resource use category across its 95% con dence interval range and varying unit prices from 50% to 150% in all cases generated incremental societal cost savings. The largest changes in societal costs came from varying the cost of the naturopathic care visits (incremental societal costs ranged from -$1948 to -$479), varying labor costs (incremental societal costs ranged from -$1784 to -$643), and varying the num-ber of adjunctive care physiotherapy visits (incremental societal costs ranged from -$1838 to -$803). However, if absenteeism costs (productivity losses) are not counted or realized, incremental societal cost savings drop to near 0 (Table 5). Nevertheless, natur-opathic care would still be considered to be the cost-effective alternative even at 0 incremental societal costs as long as its net increase in health bene ts (QALYs) remains. Because of the large number of unavailable data for the con- trol group, mainly at the 6-month follow-up, total societal costs and QALY gains were calculated including only those partici-pants who did not take the crossover naturopathic treatment option and who reported 6-month data. Comparing results for the naturopathic care group in Table 5 to those shown in Table 4, as expected due to the small number of this group lost to follow-up, there is not much change in their total societal costs (an aver-age of -$192 for those reporting 6-month data compared to -$188 for the full sample) or QALYs (an average of 0.0263 for those reporting 6-month data compared to 0.0293 for the full sample). It seems that those in the naturopathic group who did not pro-vide 6-month data were doing somewhat better health-wise (QALYs, when they are included, are higher) and were almost identical on costs to those who provided data. The control group participants who took crossover naturopathic treatment and/or who did not provide 6-month data were doing worse health-wise (average QALYs decrease from 0.0110 to 0.0036 when they are included) and had higher costs (average societal costs increase from $666 to $1024 when they are included) than those who did not cross over but did provide 6-month data. Therefore, those lost to 6-month follow-up in the naturopathic group were doing better than average and those lost to 6-month follow-up in the control group were doing worse than average in terms of both HRQoL and costs. Control group participants who did not take crossover care and did provide 6-month data also were in better health at baseline than control participants who opted for cross-over naturopathic care (Table 3). DISCUSSION Naturopathic care for the treatment of chronic low back pain in this population of warehouse workers is a cost-effective alternative to a standardized physiotherapy education regimen from a societal perspective. Naturopathic care resulted in signi -cantly lower societal costs and signi cantly better HRQoL than the control treatment over the 3-month treatment period and 3-month follow-up. Naturopathic care was also cost-effective to the employer and participants under the coverage assumptions used in this study. This is the rst economic evaluation of naturopathic medi- cine and one of the rst of a package of care including comple-mentary and alternative medicine therapies. 22 Naturopathic 38 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Naturopathic Care for Chronic Low Back Painmedicine is practiced as a system of medicine, not as individual therapies.23 Therefore, it is appropriate that multiple therapies (here acupuncture, exercise and dietary advice, relaxation train-ing, and a back care education booklet) applied by trained natur-opathic physicians be included in an evaluation of naturopathic medicine. However, this study falls short of an evaluation of the system of naturopathic medicine in that the physicians were restricted to these modalities in their treatment of patients. 24 Although this study followed published guidelines for eco- nomic evaluations,25-27 it is not without limitations, and as with any economic evaluation, the generalizability of the results depends on the assumptions made. For example, there are a num-ber of factors that could improve the cost-effectiveness of natur-opathic care for low back pain offered in other settings. This study did not measure \"presenteeism\" (productivity at work) impacts, which could signi cantly increase the savings in productivity due to the intervention. In one study, workers who reported chronic back or neck disorders as their primary condition also reported an average reduction of 21.7% over the last month in their at-work productivity. 28 Similarly, if reductions in lost leisure time follow the same pattern as work-related productivity losses, the inclusion of the value of quality leisure time regained would also increase cost-effectiveness. The duration of the intervention also could be shortened to reduce intervention costs. A recently completed growth curve analysis of the trial data indicates that although a 3-month intervention period was used in this study, the full health benefits of the intervention could be achieved after 2 months, and the health bene ts of naturopathic care are main-tained at a constant level for the duration of the 3-month follow-up (Herman and Sechrest, in preparation). If impacts continue past 6 months, cost-effectiveness analyses taking this longer peri-od of bene ts into account would show an even greater increase in health bene ts in terms of QALYs. There are also a number of factors that could reduce the cost- effectiveness of naturopathic care. Because this study used an onsite clinic to provide care during work hours, there were no travel, time-off-work, or child-care costs for visits. Inclusion of these costs would likely decrease cost-effectiveness. The same 2 naturopathic physicians offered both the naturopathic care and control group treatment. It is possible that they unconsciously negatively biased the results of the control group. Lack of blinding also may have negatively biased the results of the control group, especially since this was a sample of workers who volunteered for a study of naturopathic care, albeit with the forewarning that they may not be randomized to the naturopathic care group. Participants seemed to show a strong preference for naturopathic care\u2014all immediate post-randomization dropouts were from the control group, and 42% of those remaining at 3 months took advantage of the offer of crossover naturopathic care. Retention in the naturopathic care group was excellent (82% at 6-month follow-up), and the participants who left the study, possibly due to time constraints, tended to be those with the better health outcomes. In the control group the non-completers and those taking advan-tage of the crossover tended to be those with worse health out-comes. A pre-randomization measure of patient preferences may have provided some insight into these results. Other limitations include the small sample size, the unavoid- able reduction in follow-up data for the control group due to the popularity of the naturopathic care crossover offer, the lack of a direct measure of absenteeism, and the limits on generalizability that come from recruiting all participants from 1 worksite. CONCLUSIONS This economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized control trial shows naturopathic care to be more cost-effective than a standardized physiotherapy education regimen in the treatment of chronic low back pain from the societal, employer, and partici-pant perspectives. Further studies of the economic impact of naturopathic medicine are warranted, especially those that address the limitations of this study.

Irvine extracted the compound from urine,1,5 correctly assigned the structure to the pyrrole family,1,6 and conferred the common name.1 Early technology permitted only qualitative assay.2,6-8 Hoffer observed that recovery from acute schizophrenia asso- ciated with disappearance of Mauve from the urine, regression with reappearance. 2,4,7 Large doses of vitamin B3 suppressed Mauve in schizophrenics.6,7,9 Pfeiffer reported superior clinical results with combined vitamin B6 and zinc, which suppressed Mauve and improved symptoms in many neurobehavioral disorders.10-17 The Pfeiffer group introduced a colorimetric quantitative assay for Mauve,18 which utilizes kryptopyrrole (KP) as standard. Structural similarity affords the use of KP as standard for HPL assay, but the 2 molecules are distinct (Figure 1).

Heightened HPL excretion classically associates with emotional stress, which in turn is known to associate with oxidative stress. For this review, markers for nutritional status and for oxidative stress were examined in relationship to urinary HPL. In cohorts with mixed diagnoses, 24-hour urinary HPL cor- related negatively with vitamin B 6 activity and zinc concentra- tion in red cells subnormal subnormal zinc with remarkable consistency. HPL correlated inversely with plasma glutathione and red-cell catalase, and correlated directly with plasma nitric oxide ( P<.0001). Thus, besides implying pro- portionate needs for vitamin B 6 and zinc, HPL is a promising biomarker for oxidative stress. HPL is known to cause non-erythroid heme depression, which lowers zinc, increases nitric oxide, and increases oxidative stress. Administration of prednisone reportedly provoked HPL excretion in animals. Since adrenocorticoid (and catecholamine) stress hormones mediate intestinal permeability, urinary HPL was examined in relationship marker for intestinal permeability. levels of indicans ( P<.0001). Antibiotics reportedly reduce HPL in urine, suggesting an enterobic role in production. Potentially, gut is a reservoir for HPL or its precursor, and stress-related changes in intestinal permeability mediate systemic . VOL. 14, NO. 2 41 Discerning the Mauve Factor, Part 1for clarity may be substituted for erroneous use of \"kryptopyrrole\" in older documents. \"High-Mauve\" denotes subjects or groups with elevated HPL or with a tendency to excrete excess HPL. \"Pyrroluria\" lacks speci city, as many pyrroles appear in urine. HPL is unstable outside the body, readily interconverting with other structures. 19,39,42-45 Exposure to light or to seemingly mild chemical treatments reduces detectable HPL,8,19,39 which also is acid labile44 (a study that unadvisedly used hydrochloric acid to preserve urine failed to detect HPL in schizophrenia,46 a condi- tion well known for HPL elevation). Graham reported the half-life of HPL in urine at room temperature to be 10 to 12 hours, although the extent of light exposure was unspeci ed. 39 Addition of ascorbate preservative and protection from light and heat maximize detection of HPL. Besides light-shield-ing transport tubes, one laboratory (Vitamin Diagnostics, Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey) recommends urine collection under dim light and employs darkroom assay conditions. If assay for HPL cannot be performed immediately, overnight shipment and/or freezing of the urine sample are required by all North American laboratories surveyed for this review. Gorchein found that freezing to -8\u00ba C stabilized HPL in urine for up to 4 months. 47 Re-freezing of thawed specimens diminishes detect- able HPL (Ellen Hanson, Laboratory Superviser, Direct Health Care Access II Laboratory, Inc, Mount Prospect, Illinois; oral communication, September 2006). KP is readily oxidized, 39,48 so laboratories take special pre- cautions to maintain purity of KP used for colorimetric HPL assay. Occasionally, the colorimetric assay is invalidated by the presence of other Ehrlich-reactive compounds which produce spectrophotometric interference at 540 nm. Urobilinogen is the most common offender. 18,49 Others reportedly include hemoglo- bin, bilirubin, and mendelamine (oral communication, September 2006, from Irwin Sommerfeld, Laboratory Director of Direct Health Care Access II Laboratory). V ALIDATION OF THE COLORIMETRIC ASSA synthetic HPL standard is highly sensitive and speci c. In a comparison of split-urine samples by Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, the simpler colorimetric assay for HPL correlated very highly with HPLC/MS (r=0.98; P<.0001) (Figure 2). It should be noted that absolute HPL values varied on the 2 assays. The normal range for colorimetric assay was <15 g/dL, but for MS/HPLC, normal was <25 g/dL. The latter compares favorably with Graham's normal range of <26 g/dL utilizing gas-liquid chromatography and synthetic HPL standard. 39 EFFECTS OF V ARIABLE HYDRATION ON HPL CONCENTRATION Normalization of values to urinary speci c gravity (SG)50 or creatinine corrects for variable hydration. Pfeiffer encouraged normalization of the colorimetric assay to SG in his later years, according to Tapan Audhya, PhD (oral communication, June 2006). Examination of results from 600 colorimetric assays from the BioCenter Laboratory in Wichita, Kansas, revealed that 20% of HPL values moved into or out of the normal range after adjust-ment to SG by refractometry. Examination of data from the Biocenter Laboratory and from the Direct Health Care Access II Laboratory revealed that normalization affects reported HPL val-ues up to 4-fold. Normalization was found to improve correlation with other laboratory parameters. Before normalization to SG, HPL in single-void specimens from subjects with mixed diagnoses failed to correlate significantly with plasma zinc (N=87; r=-0.15; P=.18). In written communication from July 2006, William Walsh, PhD, reported that signi cant correlations were achieved after normalization of colorimetric (HPL) Is Distinct From Kryptopyrrole (KP) Structural similarity of the compounds affords the use of KP as standard in the colorimetric assay for HPL. 020406080100120 urinary HPL.

However, typical quantities of ascorbate employed (250-500 mg) alter SG of urine in the usual 10 mL transport tube. Laboratories have found ways to overcome this dif culty. Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory divides the urine at time of collection, yielding a second, unpreserved specimen for determination of SG. Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory director Tapan Audhya, PhD, reports that for 24-hour urine collection, conservation of HPL with negligible effects on SG are achieved by addition of 500 mg of ascorbate to the large, refrigerated container, from which a small aliquot is examined for HPL and SG. MAUVE IN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS All humans apparently excrete small quantities of HPL in urine. As assayed by HPLC/MS under strict darkroom conditions, Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory nds that the normal concentra- tion of HPL in urine is 2 to 25 g/dL. In our survey of labs in North America, Europe, and Australia, the upper limit of normal for HPL by colorimetric assay varies between 8 and 20 g/dL. As an approximate yardstick, clinicians consider urinary HPL levels over twice the upper limit of normal as highly elevated. V ery high HPL measurements\u2014hundreds of micrograms per decili-ter\u2014are reported and not strictly limited by primary diagnosis. HPL is detectable in human blood 3,39,45,53,54 and (2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, synthetic HPL standard) ranged between 4 and 10 g/dL. Dialysis cleared HPL from both blood and urine. 54 Interfering substances have frustrated efforts to develop a practi-cal blood test for HPL. Mauve Excretion Patterns In most cases, day-to-day deviations around a baseline mean do not preclude identi cation of subjects prone to HPL elevation. Sporadic spikes in HPL well above baseline associate with stress, as will be discussed later. There is evidence that HPL excretion can increase very rapidly. In 1992, a study for the US Navy mea-sured urinary HPL (colorimetric, normalized to SG) after male volunteers were subjected to brief cold-water immersion stress. In an oral summary of the study, Tapan Audhya, PhD, reported in 2002 the observation of signi cant increases in HPL excretion at 30 minutes, with peaks (as high as 80 g/dL) at 1 hour and reversion to baseline at 24 hours. HPL excretion appears to be greater during waking hours than during sleep. According to William Walsh, PhD, Pfeiffer suggested second-void spot urine specimens for HPL because he considered rst-void measurement misleading (oral communica-tion, July 2006). At Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, HPL in urine collected from subjects over 24 hours was higher from noon until midnight than from midnight until noon. It is noted that speci c collection circumvents intra-day varia- tions in HPL excretion, as a practical matter, laboratories accept single-void urines, randomly timed. Hoffer favored same- time collection of specimens to improve comparability (written communication, August 2006). HPL IN NEUROBEHA VIORAL DISORDERS The discovery of HPL grew out of Hoffer's interest in the possible biochemical etiology of schizophrenia. In 1961 he reported for the rst time that certain urinary \"unknown sub-stances\" on chromatograms were detectable in most schizo-phrenics hospitalized for active symptoms or relapses but not detectable after symptoms improved or abated ( P<.001). 7,8,56,57 It is now understood that these substances were HPL and its inter-converting isomers. Hoffer applied the qualitative urinary test as an indicator for treatment with vitamin B 3, which reduced schizophrenic symptoms and excretion of HPL.4 In an article that accompanied Hoffer's initial report, Irvine rst used the term Mauve factor .1 The compound associated sig- nificantly with psychometric scores for abnormal perception, paranoia, depression, and other symptoms in schizophrenics. 6,45,58 Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality associated with the compound in psychiatric patients. 5 It became clear that Mauve is not con ned to schizophre- nia. In 1965, O'Reilly reported Mauve elevations in affective psy-chosis, alcoholism, psychoneurosis, and \"disturbed children.\" 59 According to Joan Mathews Larson, executive director of the Health Recovery Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Mauve is ele-vated in approximately 75% of subjects seeking treatment for substance abuse (oral communication, July 2002). Mauve eleva-tion is documented in many cognitive, affective, and neurobe-havioral disorders (Table 1). 4,8,22,23,30,32,52,58-69 HPL AND STRESS O'Reilly hypothesized that Mauve excretion increases during TABLE 1 Neurobehavioral Disorders Associated With Elevated HPL* Diagnosis Percentage High-Mauve AIP22,32 100 Latent AIP52 70 7 1 Schizophrenia, acute8,58,61,62 59-80 Schizophrenia, chronic23,30,63,64 40-50 Criminal behavior Adults, sudden deviance 71 Y attention de cit hyper- activity disorder.ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 43 Discerning the Mauve Factor, Part 1physical or psychosocial (\"emotional\") stress.59 Over decades, cli- nicians formed the strong opinion that, irrespective of behavioral diagnosis, stress increases associated symptoms and excretion of Mauve. 11,16,30 Pfeiffer came to state unequivocally is stress-induced factor.\"14(p775) Sohler reportedly induced HPL with experimental stress.45 The effect of cold-water stress in the unpublished US Navy study was described earlier. McCabe advocated short-term increases in B6 dosing to blunt symptomatic deterioration in high-Mauve subjects during physical or emotional stress. 49 Clinicians give higher short-term \"stress doses\" of both B6 and zinc.16,70 VITAMIN B6 AND ZINC Pfeiffer discovered the clinical response of high-Mauve sub- jects to B6 and zinc in 1971 and saw remarkable improvements in a series of 1000 high-Mauve patients.16,71 Treatment with B6 and zinc reportedly reduced mean uri- nary HPL in 99 patients from 60 +g/dL to 30 +g/dL in 1 month.30 Although randomized trials have not been performed, combined B6 and zinc are now entrenched as core treatment for high-Mauve subjects. According to William Walsh, PhD, neu- robehavioral symptoms associated with elevated HPL may improve after only a few days of therapy with B 6 and zinc (oral communication, 2006). Discontinuation may result in severe deterioration within 48 hours. 11 Clinicians report proportionality between Mauve excretion and symptom severity30 and according to the late Hugh Riordan, MD, former director of the Center for the Improvement of Human Functioning International, Wichita, Kansas (oral com-munication, 2000), higher Mauve excretion usually requires higher dosages of B 6 and zinc for suppression. HPL in urine decreased progressively with higher B6 dosing,16 and progressive B6 glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (EGOT).72 Initially, Pfeiffer tended to use high doses of vitamin B6 (400-3000 mg daily) and relatively modest (\"dietary\") doses of zinc. Later, some patients were noted to respond optimally to B 6 and as much as 160 mg daily of elemental zinc.11 In the collective experience of the authors, long-term treatment with B6 and zinc usually is needed for ongoing HPL suppression and symptom management. Optimal initial dosages may be higher than main-tenance dosages. Zinc requirements in high-Mauve subjects are noted to increase during growth spurts then decline abruptly. Pfeiffer reported that on occasion, previously high-Mauve sub-jects no longer may require high doses of B 6 and zinc16; the phe- nomenon was con rmed in oral communication in 2003 with Mark V onnegut, MD, a former high-Mauve Pfeiffer patient and now a practicing pediatrician in Quincy, Massachusetts. Pfeiffer's claims of a \"double de ciency\" of B6 and zinc in association with abnormal Mauve excretion10 were based on the clinical response to supplementation and a pattern of lower blood levels of zinc and functional B 6 status (pyridoxal-5-phosphate [P5P] and EGOT) among his high-Mauve patients.11,73,74 Numerical data were not published.Pfeiffer and Sohler proposed that functional B6 de ciency and zinc de ciency in high-Mauve subjects results from increased uri- nary loss of P5P and zinc due to complexation with Mauve, and they cited 20 g/dL higher zinc content in spot urines of Mauve-postive subjects. 11 The finding would extrapolate to relatively insubstantial total zinc loss, unless the effect extended to other routes of excretion. Pfeiffer published evidence of binding between P5P and KP 11 and between zinc and KP18 but did not study HPL. Validation of HPL as a Marker for B6 Status The original data presented in this review were retrieved retroactively and anonymously from laboratory records, without regard to primary diagnosis or other criteria. In samples collect-ed at the Biolab Medical Unit, London, colorimetric (n=58; r=-0.42; P=.001). In Vitamin Diagnostic Laboratory, HPL by HPLC/MS in 24-hour urines, with (n=32; P<.0001); all abnormal HPL below-normal or borderline-low EGOT (Figure 3). The data af rm HPL as biomarker for functional B 6 de - ciency and rationalize treatment with B6. Clinical response of high-Mauve subjects to B6 may relate to known mechanisms by which B6 subserves neuronal function. Numerous signs, symp- toms, and traits have been observed in association with Mauve (Table 2). Poor dream recall and mild morning nausea/break-fast anorexia may relate especially to B 6 de ciency.13,16,73,75 Pfeiffer suggested that stretch marks result from a combined de ciency of B 6 and zinc.13 EGOT activity ratio0.84 0.82 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2Validation of HPL as a Marker for Zinc Status White fl ecks in the nails (Figure 4) are responsive to zinc16,71,76 and reportedly detectable in 60% of high-Mauve subjects.64 HPL was examined in relationship to 3 different measurements for zinc. As discussed earlier, Walsh reported that plasma zinc and single-void colorimetric levels correlated strongly with urinary samples at the BioLab Medical Unit, single-void colori-metric HPL (unadjusted to SG) from a mixed cohort substantially with white-cell zinc (N=58; r=-0.60; P<.0001). Abnormal HPL corresponded to below-normal white-cell zinc in 42 of 58 patients (Figure 5). In samples at Vitamin Diagnostic Laboratory, stronger association existed between red-cell zinc and 24-hour urinary HPL (HPLC/MS, adjusted a mixed cohort (N=37; r=-0.88; P<.0001). Twenty-four of 24 subjects with elevated HPL had below-normal red-cell zinc (Figure 6). HPL AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL PARAMETERS Oscar Kruesi, MD, former academic dean for Integrative Medicine, Capitol University, Washington, District of Columbia, reported a pattern of low plasma biotin levels in high-Mauve patients (oral communication, 2005). At the Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, 24-hour urinary HPL (HPLC/MS, adjusted to SG) and plasma biotin concentrations from a small, mixed cohort strongly correlated (N=24; r=-0.88, P<.0001). Elevated HPL predicted below-normal plasma biotin in 16 of 16 subjects (Figure 7). These data are the rst to suggest biotin de ciency in association with HPL. Biotin de ciency causes neurological disease in animals and humans 77,78 and is more common than thought.79 Examination of laboratory records found no association between HPL and markers for vitamin neurotoxic in humans: (1) structural homology to known neurotoxin; (2) acute behav-ioral effects in animals; (3) porphyrinogenicity in animals; (4) TABLE 2 Signs, Symptoms, and Traits Clinicians Report as More Prevalent in High-Mauve Patients*4,10,11,13,16,30,49,64,71,73 Poor dream recall Nail spots Stretch marks (striae) Pale skin/poor tanningCoarse eyebrowsKnee and joint painAcne 6-responsive Crime and Substance abuse AlcoholismStress intoleranceEmotional labilityExplosive anger Disordered perceptionBipolar disorderAutism *The frequency these features their relationship to biochemical abnor- malities associated with HPL are not well-studied.

As a class, pyrroles have been called \"nerve poisons.\" 80 HPL is from and PBG82 are monopyrroles which exert potent effects on the nervous system. KP3,10,22,24,25,29,31-33,45,83 and the hydroxylactam of kryptopyrrole (KPL),84,85 highly homolo-gous to HPL, cause acute neurobehavioral effects in animals. Structural similarity of HPL to pyroglutamate and kainic acid 41 sug- gests possible direct effects neurotransmission. Irvine produced ptosis, locomotor abnormalities, and hypo- thermia in rats with unspeci ed doses of HPL.86 Cutler found that intraperitoneal injection of HPL 0.65 mol/kg produced relative-ly mild acute effects: decreased gross activity, increased prefer-ence for light areas of the cage, and a trend toward more aggressive behavior. A higher dose of 1.95 mol/kg increased head-twitch and backward locomotion, 41 behaviors seen in rats treated with hallucinogens.87 Strictly by estimation, Cutler discounted signi cant behav- ioral effects in humans from HPL, because the plasma concentra-tion of 0.3 mol/kg (equivalent to 4.6 g/dL) achieved in rats with the higher dose of HPL was adjudged \"many-fold\" greater than plausible HPL blood levels in humans. 41 The estimation overlooked published data from Semmelweiss Medical University, which reported a whole-blood range for HPL of 4 to 10 g/dL in schizophrenics. 54 Cutler's higher dose of HPL achieved range. HPL de nitely is porphyrinogenic in animals. Cutler's lower dose of HPL significantly increased total urinary porphyrin excretion in rats. 52,85,88 Graham documented peak urinary HPL immediately prior to a severe attack of acute intermittent por-phyria (AIP), 39 but alteration of porphyrin metabolism by HPL has not been proven in humans. Nevertheless, elevation of HPL in the porphyrias is well documented. 22,32,89-93 neurovisceral may reach urinary concentration as high as 946 g/dL.90 In AIP\u2014 including the latent state\u2014HPL consistently associates with uri-nary PBG and ALA. 52,93 The association of HPL with ALA is not limited to AIP. In a mixed group of psychiatric patients (N=128), urinary HPL and ALA correlated positively. 94 ALA is a potent oxidant and neuro- toxin95 with known effects on neuronal energy production96 and neurotransmission.97,98 ALA binds P5P and produces free radicals by autooxidation.99 Animal studies that failed to increase ALA after injection with HPL88 used the Cutler doses. Ex vivo ,guinea-pig ileal contractions were inhibited by HPL at seemingly high concentrations of 8.5 mol/kg (132 g/dL),100 but HPL in human bowel or stool has not been quanti ed for reference. HPL DEPRESSES HEME Heme is tightly coupled to neuronal metabolic Depression heme leads to metabolic crisis, with mitochondrial102 and neuronal103 decay.

Besides potential depression by HPL, de ciencies of zinc, B 6, and biotin (all tors heme synthesis) independently 99,102 is degraded by stress.102 It should be men- tioned as well that heavy metals, which have not been examined in relation to Mauve, are renowned dysregulators of porphyrin metabolism and increase heme degradation. 102 Heme plays a central role in energy production and is required by a family of biomolecules needed for reductase. Ultimately, heme depression increases oxidant leak from mitochondria and damage to cells. 99,102 HPL AND OXIDATIVE STRESS Oxidative stress clearly results from de ciency of zinc or B6, as reviewed by McGinnis.105 For example, even marginal B6 de - ciency is with reductase, and mitochondrial decay. 106-108 The B6 vitamers are themselves highly vulnerable to damage by oxidative species.109-111 P5P protects neurons from oxi- dative stress, apparently by increasing energy production and lowering excitotoxicity, 112,113 and zinc supplementation decreases oxidized biomolecules.114,115 Since HPL is a marker for B6 and zinc de ciency, HPL is a potential biomarker for oxidative stress. Biomarkers for oxidative stress are known to be higher in high-Mauve disorders such as schizophrenia,116,117 autism,118-120 ADHD,121,122 Down syndrome,123-125 In schizo- levels of glutathione and response to intra-venous glutathione were reported nearly 50 years ago. 129 Plasma levels of reduced GSH, the ubiquitous intracellular antioxidant, are decreased in diseases associated with greater oxidative stress, 130 including Down syndrome.131 In Alzheimer's disease, in which oxidative modification of brain precedes appearance of neurofibrillary tangles and plaque, 132,133 plasma GSH correlates inversely with brain levels of oxidatively-modi ed biomolecules. 134 It is reasonable to view plasma GSH as a bio- marker for pathological effects of oxidative stress. Initial data from a small cohort of Austrian patients with mixed diagnoses suggested an association between urinary HPL and plasma GSH. Peter Lauda, modestly with red-cell (r=-0.41) in a group of patients in whom HPL was elevated only in 1 of 13 subjects (written communication, 2005). In samples from the Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, 24-hour urinary HPL (HPLC/MS, normalized to SG) from a strongly correlated with plasma GSH (N=30; r=-0.85; P.0001), and abnormal HPL associated with below- normal plasma GSH in 17 of 17 subjects (Figure 8). V ery strong correlation with plasma GSH substantiates urinary HPL as bio-marker Catalase is an endogenous antioxidant that prevents excess cellular hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), a freely-diffusible and potent oxidant. Catalase consists of 4 protein subunits, each requiring a heme group. Since catalase requires heme and HPL suppresses heme, it follows that HPL may associate with lower catalase. Lower catalase in blood is reported in schizophrenia 116,135 and autism.136 In samples collected at the Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, red-cell catalase activity in a mixed cohort was found to correlate inversely with 24-hour urinary HPL Abnormal HPL corresponded to subnormal catalase in 15 of 17 subjects (Figure 9). In addition to proposed direct effects of HPL on heme synthesis, depression of catalase may result from greater oxidative stress in high-Mauve subjects, because catalase is sensitive to oxidative degradation 137 (as is GSHPx,138 which also can remove H2O2 in a reaction using GSH as substrate).139 Depressed catalase hypothetically predisposes high-Mauve subjects to excess H2O2 and presents a possible explanation for hypopigmentation of skin associated with Mauve\u2014including, in the extreme, classic \"china-doll\" complexion. 10,11 The pathogene- sis of vitiligo illuminates the effect of abnormal catalase and H 2O2 on pigmentation. A genetic polymorphism for catalase apparently predisposes patients to vitiligo.140 All patients with vitiligo exhibit decreased catalase and increased H2O2 in epider- mis.141 In the presence of excess H2O2, melanocytes142 and mela- nin (which normally functions to bind redox-active metals and thereby reduce oxidative stress) are damaged, resulting in lesser pigment production. 130 If destruction of melanocytes by excess H2O2 is not complete, treatment with pseudo-catalase skin pigmentation by reducing H2O2.143,144Plasma GSH ( mo/L)6 5432 1 0 0 50 100 (g/dL) FIGURE 8 47 Discerning the Mauve Factor, Part 1As stress classically associates with Mauve, so do stressful life events associate with the onset of vitiligo.145,146 Catecholamines, which increase as a consequence of stress, are increased in vitiligo patients, particularly during the active phase. 147 Both the synthesis of catecholamines and their auto-oxidation produce H2O2.139,148,149 Catecholamine excess is cytotoxic in diverse tissues, and the toxicity is oxidatively mediated by H2O2. Excess is implicated clearly in human heart disease, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis produced by catecholamine infusion is prevented by antioxidant vitamins. 150 In cultured neurons, toxicity of epinephrine and nor- epinephrine is reproduced by addition of equimolar H2O2 or blocked completely by addition of catalase.151 Catecholamine excess in neurobehavior was anticipated by Abram Hoffer in the Adrenochrome Hypothesis of Schizophrenia in 1954. 152,153 Besides lighter skin, lighter hair coloration than siblings and earlier gray is reported in high-Mauve subjects. Excess H2O2 is known to increase proportions of oxymelanin in hair, with lightening analogous to the effect achieved by topical application of bleach for cosmetic purposes. 154 Excess H2O2 remains hypo- thetical until levels are measured in the high-Mauve population. Zinc de ciency alone may explain hypopigmentation associated with Mauve. Melanin is rich in zinc and requires zinc for synthe-sis and maintenance. 150,155 Zinc protects melanocytes from rats.157 Oxidants, including H2O2,158 displace zinc from binding proteins, and it has been suggested that clinical zinc depletion results inherently from greater oxidative stress. 105 HPL AND NITRIC OXIDE Heme depression results in excess nitric oxide (NO),101 which is injurious to the brain159,160 and is suspected to play a role in such high-Mauve disorders as schizophrenia,161 autism,162 and Down syndrome.163 In schizophrenia and autism, stable metabo- lites of NO are elevated in conjunction with greater thiobarbitu-ric acid-reactive substances in plasma. 162 In samples from a mixed cohort at Vitamin Diagnostics Laboratory, plasma NO, measured directly, and 24-hour urinary HPL by HPLC/MS, normalized to SG, The statistical relationship strengthens substan- tially (r=0.96) if an extreme outlier is excluded on the presumption of poor sample preservation (Figure 10). The strong association with NO enhances Mauve as a biomarker for oxidative stress. It should be noted that while altered functional B 6, zinc, biotin, GSH, catalase, and NO all point toward increased oxida-tive stress in association with urinary HPL, the data presented are from non-congruent cohorts. Proof that these parameters move together would require same-subject measurement of each. Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge Nina A.

Editor's note: This article is a follow-up to an article that appeared in our Jan/Feb 2008 issue, \"Increasing Research Capacity at the New England School of Acupuncture: Building Grants Management Infrastructure\" ( Altern Ther Health Med . 2008;14(1):56-64). Acupuncture schools and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) institutions have the potential to make signi cant contributions to CAM research. 1-3 To date, however, few CAM institutions have developed research programs that have enabled them to play leading roles in clinical and mechanistic research. In a companion article, we discussed how limitations in grants management infrastructure at small CAM institutions can be a significant barrier to the development of independent research programs capable of submitting and managing federal research grants. 4 We also discussed how the New England School of Acupuncture (NESA), in collaboration with the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Osher Institute and with the support of a Developmental Center for Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (DCRC) grant awarded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the National Institutes of Health, developed its grants manage-ment infrastructure and increased its research capacity. In the present article, we discuss another DCRC-supported set of initiatives designed and implemented to increase research original article INCREASING RESEARCH CAPACITY AT THE NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF ACUPUNCTURE THROUGH FACULTY AND STUDENT RESEARCH TRAINING INITIATIVES Peter M.

Schachter, MD Few complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) institutions require their students to undergo substantive training in research literacy and conduct, and well-developed programs to train CAM institution faculty in research are virtually non-existent. As part of a National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) initiative to increase research capacity at CAM institutions, the New England School of Acupuncture (NESA), in collaboration with the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Osher Institute, was awarded a Developmental Center for Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (DCRC) grant. This article discusses a number of initiatives that we designed and implemented to train NESA students, faculty members, and alumni in the foundations of clinical research and to stimulate interest in both participating in research and receiv-ing additional research training. Speci c initiatives included a 30-hour faculty \"Foundations of Research\" course; a year-long course entitled, \"How to Write a Publishable Case Report\"; insti-tution of a monthly research seminar series; revision of an already required student research course; and the addition of 2 new student-mentored independent research electives. We dis-cuss successes and challenges encountered in developing and administering these initiatives and the overall impact they have had on research culture and productivity at NESA. ( Altern Ther Health Med. 2008;14(2):52-58.)ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 53 Research Training at the New England School of Acupuncturecapacity at NESA--namely, research education and training pro- grams for faculty members, students, and alumni. We begin by reviewing the status of research training available at Oriental medicine (OM) institutions like NESA in the United States and then describe a number of interrelated initiatives aimed at improving research knowledge and research capacity within the NESA community. We discuss initiatives that have been success-ful, challenges we have encountered, and lessons we learned that might be relevant to other CAM institutions that wish to develop a research program. A more complete discussion of the scope of NESA's research program and the aims and structure of its DCRC program within which these educational initiatives were devel-oped can be found elsewhere. 4 RESEARCH TRAINING AT NESA AND OTHER ORIENTAL MEDICINE COLLEGES AND INSTITUTIONS Even in OM schools with advanced master's and doctoral degree programs, training in research literacy and research con-duct for students is very limited, as curricula generally focus on the development of practical clinical skills. The Accreditation Commission for Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACCAOM) does not have any formal requirements for research training. Some OM schools in the United States currently offer 1 basic course in research; however, the content of these courses varies considerably across institutions. Only a few offer advanced electives in research and/or provide students with opportunities for practical research experience or training. Well developed pro-grams to train OM faculty in research are virtually nonexistent. Like most other OM colleges, before the establishment of NESA's research program, NESA was primarily a \"vocational,\" clinically-focused program. An aim of both NESA's overall research program and the DCRC was to increase faculty, student, and alumni literacy, knowledge, and skills related to clinical research so that members of the NESA community could become effective clinical researchers. To address this aim within the DCRC, an education sub-committee was established that helped develop and oversee 5 initiatives related to faculty, student, and alumni training in research. The committee was composed of NESA's research director, HMS Osher Institute's director of edu-cation, NESA's student research coordinator, and faculty mem-bers representing all research-related courses. The 5 initiatives were (1) a new course for NESA faculty and alumni entitled, \"Clinical Research Methods and Evaluation\"; (2) a second new faculty and alumni course entitled, \"How to Write a Publishable Case Report\"; (3) initiation of a community-wide, monthly OM research seminar series; (4) curriculum revisions of an already existing and mandatory student research course; and (5) devel-opment of 2 new student electives in mentored research. Each initiative has involved both NESA and HMS faculty members. Table 1 summarizes these initiatives. Faculty Clinical Research Methods and Evaluation This introductory course represents the rst research-related training initiative created for NESA faculty and alumni. The aims of the course are to (1) introduce the fundamental principles and methods of clinical, epidemiological, and basic mechanistic sci-ence research design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation; (2) develop the skills and literacy required to locate, retrieve, and evaluate the published OM literature critically; and (3) under-stand the special issues related to the conduct of CAM or OM research. The course is taught in 3 discrete units over 3 week-ends. The goal of the rst unit, which covers the fundamentals, is to introduce participants to the scienti c method and to speci c types of scienti c inquiry, focusing especially on the randomized controlled trial (RCT). The unit describes the rationale for the RCT and the methods used to conduct trials (especially acupunc-ture trials), including theory and hypothesis generation, blind-ing, randomization, statistical analysis, and procedures used to reduce bias. This unit concludes by introducing students to some of the challenges of conducting ecologically valid RCTs of acu-puncture and the unique challenges related to acupuncture con-trol interventions.

Working in teams, they become familiar with databases, learn how to con-duct a literature search on a speci c OM topic, and then collec-tively work to evaluate a select group of published RCTs according to both established criteria (Jadad's scale) and newer standards used to evaluate acupuncture (eg, STRICTA 7). In the nal unit, participants present short literature reviews on topics of interest. This nal unit also covers new innovative methods for studying OM (including qualitative research, devel-opment of valid OM measures). In this unit, participants also return to the question of what method should serve as the appro-priate control for studies of acupuncture. At this point in the course, participants have reviewed and evaluated a wide range of studies including functional magnetic resonance imaging and basic science studies. They also have discussed studies that report to validate different methods for controlling for the non-speci c effects of acupuncture. By returning to the issue of acu-puncture controls that they initially considered in the first session, participants come to appreciate the growth they have experienced in their knowledge base and sophistication. The course content is similar to that of an already existing and required student research course that is discussed later, although the format and some of the content is varied when taught to faculty and alumni. Both this and the student course were developed and are taught by 2 active OM researchers (Drs Conboy and Kerr) who hold faculty appointments at both NESA and HMS. A more detailed outline of the curricula for these courses is presented in Table 2. Because NESA faculty members tend to have busy teaching and clinical schedules and because research is not always viewed as clinically relevant to OM practitioners, a number of strategies were developed to recruit faculty to this course. First, faculty members were surveyed to ascertain the most convenient timing and format for the course. The results of this survey indicated that conducting the course over 3 sequential weekends (30 contact hours in total) was most practical. Second, the research director sent a personal letter to all faculty members announcing and describing the course and highlighting how important and unique an opportunity this was for the OM community, NESA, and the faculty memebers' personal professional development. This cam-paign was supplemented by announcements in faculty meetings and newsletters and personal phone calls. Finally, the course has been offered at no cost to active faculty members, and faculty members and participating alumni have been awarded continuing education (CE) credits. The course was also open to the larger community for a fee and was advertised as such through the NESA Continuing Education Program, which advertises nationally. The course has now been offered twice and was well attend- ed. The rst time the course was offered, 8 of 70 faculty members attended. In the second offering, there were 13 participants (12 actively practicing alumni and 1 new faculty member). In both years, the program received excellent reviews. Representative qualitative evaluations of this course included the following com-ments: \"this kind of course is something every acupuncturist needs to take\"; \"the creative exchange of ideas between the scien-tists and acupuncturists was fascinating\"; \"far more interesting TABLE 2 Outline for Foundations of Clinical Research Methods and Evaluation Course Offered to NESA Faculty, Students, and Alumni* Modules Examples of topics and questions considered Introduction to theory and research What is science?

We plan to continue offering this course annually. It is now administered through NESA's continuing education program and is open to alumni and other OM and CAM professionals. \"How to Write a Publishable Case Report or Case Series\" Based on the positive experiences with the first faculty/ alumni research course and a desire expressed by faculty and alumni to become further engaged in research and academic training, a second course on writing a publishable case report or case series was developed. Because nearly all of our OM faculty members are clinicians, we thought that developing a course that focused on acquiring the competencies necessary to complete all the steps involved in publishing a peer-reviewed case study or case series based on their own patients was a practical and logical next step in research training. Specific goals for this course included (1) learning about types of case reports, including retro-spective, prospective, and case series, and their contribution to scienti c inquiry; (2) learning about the history and function of institutional review boards in the protection of human subjects in research and developing practical experience with them; (3) developing skills in OM information literacy; (4) developing sci-enti c writing skills; and (5) learning the skills related to identi-fying and submitting manuscripts to appropriate peer-reviewed journals. The course was co-developed and administered by 2 NESA faculty members and the director of education at the HMS Osher Institute and includes didactic lectures, interactive and independent exercises, and one-on-one mentoring. A more detailed outline of the course curriculum is presented in Table 3. As with the rst faculty course, a number of initiatives were undertaken to recruit faculty to this course. The course was ini-tially designed to span a 9-month period, with one 2-hour meet-ing per month. Due to slower than expected progress in meeting our course goals, particularly with respect to facilitating faculty members in developing their cases, the course has been extended to a full year. The course was rst offered in fall 2005; at the time this paper was written, it was more than 75% complete. Eleven faculty members have enrolled in the course; only 2 had partici-pated in the Foundations of Research course. Group meetings have been lively and productive. To date 9 faculty members have identified cases to develop and submitted protocols for IRB approval or exemption. Example protocol titles include \"Acupuncture regulates atrial brillation: a case report\"; \"A pro- le of users of Chinese herbal medicine at an inner-city Oriental medicine clinic\"; and \"Acupuncture for generalized anxiety disor-der: a case series.\" An evaluation for the course assessed at 7 months included the following comments: \"This course has taught me that excellence as a practitioner is only part of my job the other part is contributing to the public discourse on acu-puncture by publishing\"; \"My skills in the library were outdated.

Future offerings will be administered through NESA's CE program. Research Seminar Series Taking advantage of the large quantity and diversity of research taking place in the greater Boston area, a monthly research seminar series was established to expose the NESA com-munity to cutting-edge OM research and researchers. This initia-tive has been successful in many ways. First, we have had little dif culty attracting high-caliber speakers who are either located in the Boston area or willing to present during visits to the area. Since March 2004, we have hosted 22 speakers. Fourteen have presented work supported by NIH grants, and 13 are faculty members who are associated with HMS-af liated institutions. Six NESA faculty members involved in research have also pre-sented their work. A representative list of the topics addressed by seminar speakers is presented in Table 4. Most seminars, which generally take place during lunch, have been well attended, with an average of 20 to 25 participants consisting of approximately equal numbers of faculty members, students, and members of the general public. These monthly seminars have had a signi -cant impact on NESA's culture. They have exposed the NESA community to cutting-edge work, and researchers from other institutions have showcased their own faculty members as con-tributors to this research and fostered greater appreciation for the value of academic research to clinical practice and to the credibility of the OM profession as a whole. As of March 2006, faculty and alumni receive CE credit for attending research semi-nars. This seminar series will continue to meet on a monthly basis throughout the academic year. Foundations of Research and Elective Courses for Students Since 1998 all students at NESA have been required to par- ticipate in a 30-hour course introducing the basics of clinical and epidemiological research. Upon establishing our DCRC, the broad aims and content of this course were revised (Table 2). For students who complete this course and are interested in pursuing further research experience, a new pair of mentored research electives was developed in 2004. Students who enroll in these electives are partnered with a research mentor based either at NESA or in another Boston-area research institute. Projects can involve conducting literature reviews, serving as a research assis-tant in an ongoing study, or developing and/or conducting a small pilot study of their own, alone or with other students. Working with the mentor, each student is required to write an elective proposal with clearly defined learning objectives and nal products. The proposals are then reviewed, and if deemed quali ed, approved by NESA's student research coordinator\u2014a faculty member in charge of student research. Full academic credit for this elective requires a minimum of 90 hours of project-related activity. Students can take this elective up to 2 times for academic credit. These electives do not necessarily add addition-al credit hours to the program, as they are taken instead of other clinically-based electives. To date, 10 students have formally reg-istered for this elective. Representative projects include an audit evaluating the quality of NESA's student clinic medical records; a systematic literature review of clinical trials employing tradition-al Chinese medicine diagnoses as a design or outcome variable; a literature review of the different types of controls employed in RCTs evaluating acupuncture ef cacy; and development of a tai chi research literature database. Research Training Through Hands-on Participation in Clinical Trials In addition to the initiatives described above, another important mechanism for research education and training has been the active engagement/participation of NESA faculty, stu-dents, and alumni in ongoing studies. For example, our DCRC supports 2 pilot clinical trials of acupuncture that have engaged faculty members and students in a variety of ways, including hav-ing them serve as project co-leaders (n=2); project coordinators and/or research assistants (n=5); and acupuncture protocol developers and providers (n=10). A third DCRC-supported meth-odological study is focused on evaluating the reliability of the OM diagnostic process and developing a validated diagnostic instrument. This study alone has engaged more than 50 acu-puncturists (the majority of whom are NESA faculty or alumni) as expert consultants or diagnosticians. In addition to providing an opportunity for direct participation in a state-of-the-art NIH-funded clinical trial, each of these studies provides a substantive orientation session for acupuncturists during which the rationale and design of the study is described and discussed. Participation in these and other non-DCRC NESA trials continues to provide invaluable practical research experience that complements and informs the more didactic learning that takes place in courses and seminars. DISCUSSION Although many of the education and training initiatives described above are still in their early phases of implementation, there are a number of indications that they are positively impact-ing the general research knowledge/literacy of faculty members, students, and alumni within the NESA community and also pro-viding a pool from which more interested and motivated individ-uals can be trained to become part- or full-time researchers. First, our faculty, students, and alumni have become more interested and engaged in research. During the period of support for our DCRC, more than 75 faculty members and alumni have been involved in some aspect of an externally funded research study; some of these studies were not related to the DCRC. During this time, our faculty members have published more than 25 peer-reviewed articles related to CAM. A number of these are the rst peer-reviewed papers to be published by certain faculty members. Additionally, more than 30 NESA students have ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 57participated in some form of research through serving as research assistants or undertaking independent studies. Perhaps more signi cantly, to date, NESA has graduated at least 10 students who now include research as a signi cant component of their OM career (eg, project co-investigators, coordinators, research assistants, intervention providers); most were students during our period of DCRC support. In addition to these tangible and practical accomplish-ments, the DCRC has been a signi cant catalyst in helping NESA achieve its more conceptual goal to transform from a primarily \"vocational\" institution to an academic institution. The training initiatives described above have provided a vehicle for faculty and staff development and a forum for collegial interactions. One of the most common responses we have received from faculty mem-bers who have participated in our research courses and seminars is that the opportunity to engage in scholarly discussion with Research Training at the New England School of AcupunctureTABLE 4 Examples of Invited Speakers and Topics Addressed in the NESA Research Seminar Series* Speaker Presentation title Institutional af liation 2004 Vitaly Napadow, PhD, LicAc What Can Functional MRI Tell Us About Acupuncture and the \"Sea of Marrow\" That We Don't Already Know?HMS, MGH Richard Hammerschlag, PhD Strengthening the Evidence Base for Acupuncture: Quality Assessment of Randomized Controlled Trials, 1997-2002Oregon College of OM Rosa Schnyer, LicAc Acupuncture in the Treatment of Depression NESA, HMS Weidong Lu, MB, LicAc Acupuncture in the Treatment of Neutropenia NESA Jongbae Park, PhD, LicAc Evaluating the Effectiveness of A Personal Experience HMS Helene Langevin, MD, LicAc Acupuncture: The Connective Tissue Connection University of V ermont Andrew Ahn, MD, MPH Biophysics of Acupuncture: Electrical Properties of Connective Tissue HMS Peter Wayne, PhD Acupuncture for Chronic Stroke Symptoms: A Randomized, Sham-Controlled Trial NESA 2005 Cathy Kerr, PhD Somatosensory Cortical Maps as Neural Correlates of Qigong, Peter Valaskatgis, LicAc /Eric Macklin, PhDResults Research Program\" (SHARP): A Pilot Randomized Controlled Clinical TrialNESA and New England Research Institute Randy Gollub, MD, PhD Functional MRI Investigation of Acupuncture Analgesia HMS Eric Jacobson, PhD Healing in Tibetan Buddhist Medicine and Religion HMS Beth Sommers, MPH, LicAc Acupuncture and Side-Effect Management of HIV Medications: Results of a Pilot Clinical TrialBoston University Ji-sheng Han, MD Strengthening of Homeostasis: The Essence of Acupuncture Treatment Peking University Ary Goldberger, MD Fractals, Chaos, and Complexity in Biology and Medicine HMS Margaret Naeser, PhD, LicAc Laser Acupuncture: Brief Introduction and Summary of Research to Treat Paralysis in Stroke and Pain in Carpal Tunnel SyndromeBoston University 2006 Julie Buring, ScD Evaluating the Role of Vitamin E in the Prevention of Heart Disease: the Women's Health StudyHMS Peter Wayne, PhD Tai Chi Improves Dynamic Postural Stability in Patients with V estibular Disease: Results of a Randomized Clinical TrialNESA Judith D.

It is our expectation that over time, our training initiatives will not only continue to positively impact faculty knowledge and culture but will also positively impact how and what students are taught in didactic and practical classes. There is some indication that this is beginning to happen. For example, one faculty member who graduated from our basic research course has already begun to integrate practical evidence-based exercises into her OM pathology course and is beginning to explore how to expand such modules throughout the entire NESA curriculum. The DCRC education and faculty development activities described above have also catalyzed and dovetailed with broader initiatives led by NESA's governance and administration to fur-ther cultivate and promote scholarly activities. For example, dur-ing the DCRC program, NESA's faculty ranking scheme was altered to more closely resemble that of an academic institution; participation in scholarly activities such as research and publish-ing now plays a more prominent position in faculty ranking and promotion criteria. Since beginning our research program at NESA, we have added 5 new faculty members with doctoral-level degrees\u2014all are directly involved in research. Additionally, 6 newly formed half-time faculty positions now explicitly include up to 30% supported time for participation in research, writing, or other academic pursuits. The approval of 2 new research elec-tives also refl ects a commitment to foster more academic oppor-tunities for students. The value of these programmatic and cultural shifts is supported by a survey conducted in 2005 among incoming NESA students that indicated that 41% of them were attracted to NESA because of its involvement in research. It is expected that over time, the presence of a stable, well-integrated research program will continue to catalyze NESA's evolution toward a more academic, university-type environment. The growing presence and impact that research training and our research program in general has had on the culture of NESA has not been without some resistance and questioning. One bar-rier we encountered to the more widespread integration of research at NESA is concern that scienti c research and OM may not be compatible. Many faculty members and students at NESA were initially attracted to OM explicitly because it represents an alternative and more holistic philosophy and approach to health than scienti c, evidence-based conventional medicine. For some, the current reductionist research paradigm is believed to be inad-equate (too limiting) for studying complex, holistic, energy-based interventions such as acupuncture. According to this perspective, current approaches to research will inevitably result in biased conclusions that are unlikely to be of bene t to the OM community. This perspective is not unique to NESA and has been well articulated in a number of recent debates regarding the bene ts and limitations of the current evidence-based models for evaluating CAM practices. 2,8,9 Acknowledging, honoring, and sometimes sharing this concern, NESA's research department has been careful to emphasize that one of the motivations for our program is to engage our faculty in research so as to challenge this paradigm and help develop alternative research models and methodologies. Indeed, the majority of studies initiated at NESA have included unique design components (eg, individualized treatments, minimally invasive controls) that honor and inte-grate clinically relevant practices. As more of our community learns about research and participates in it rst-hand, this barri-er to the more widespread integration of research into our com-munity is declining. A primary motivation underlying NCCAM's DCRC program is the belief that sound CAM research requires the meaningful participation of CAM practitioners in all aspects of research--from study conception and identi cation of speci c hypotheses to development of treatment interventions, choosing outcomes measures, and interpreting results. Without signi cant training to improve research competency, however, the participation of CAM institutions in research is highly unlikely. The initiatives described in this article represent our attempt to provide educa-tion and training to improve basic research knowledge and com-petency among NESA faculty members, students, and alumni. Our curriculum and initiatives can be modi ed to suit other CAM institutions wishing to develop a research program. Research edu-cation/training is an important element in NESA's strategy for building a sustainable, productive OM research program. Other elements of this strategy include initiatives at NESA to build grants management infrastructure, to establish an independent institutional review board to oversee the ethical conduct of trials, to develop an OM research library, and to establish a fund-raising development program to help nd alternative sources of income to supplement federal grant support for research. 4 Acknowledgments This study was supported by Grant #5 U19 AT002022 from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).

In The Log from the Sea of Cortez, John Steinbeck relates how his friend Ed Ricketts, after the destruction by re of his Cannery Row laboratory, testified at a trial in the Superior Court in Salinas. His company, Paci c Biological Laboratories, Inc, was one of the plaintiffs in a suit against the electric company, unsuccessfully alleging that the re was caused by error or negligence by the company. \"Now you take the case of this re,\" he went on. \"Both sides wanted to win, and nei-ther had any interest in, indeed both sides seem to have a kind of abhorrence for, the truth.\" 1(p233) In this article we examine an exemplar (dietary supple- ments) of the clash between science and law and the dangers inherent in judges wandering in the murky eld of scienti c con-troversy and using it as the basis of a judgment. THE CASE In Commerce Commission v Zenith Corporation Limited (Auckland, New Zealand), the defendant ultimately faced 23 pairs of alternative charges, all concerning representations in promotional materials for \"Body Enhancer\" or its successor, \"Neo Nutrients Body Enhancer.\" 2 Twenty-three charges alleged representations liable to mislead the public as to the suitability for a purpose of goods, in terms of sections 40(1) and 10 New Zealand Fair Trading Act 1986 (FTA); 23 alternative charges alleged false or misleading representations as to the bene ts of goods, in terms of sections 40 (1) and 13 FTA. Two of the original informations (ie, legal lings) were withdrawn. The defendant also faced 3 charges relating to representations made on labels of \"Neo Nutrients Body Enhancer,\" which are not relevant to this article. All of the alleged offenses pre-dated the 2003 amend-ments to the FTA. Section 13 FTA was amended in 2000 and took effect November 15, 2000. By that date, the events that were the subject of some of the charges outlined above had already occurred, but others giving rise to the remaining charges had not. The effect of the amendment was to replace \"false\" in the section heading with \"false or misleading\" and to replace \"falsely represent\" as the opening words of each of paragraphs 13(a)-(f ) with \"make a false or misleading representation.\" The charges alleging a contravention of section 13(e) refl ected that amend-ment. The charges were based on representations in pamphlets and radio and magazine advertisements and on a website saying that the product \"will assist with\" a variety of conditions, includ-ing weight loss; liver detoxification; preventing the effects of body collagen depletion; healing of cartilage and strengthening of joints, tendons, and heart muscles; and others. Witnesses called by both the prosecution and the defense gave expert evidence. Judge Moore was critical of some evidence given by expert witnesses called by the defendant. He described Professor Vitetta, for example, as a witness \"whose approach seemed founded on a sense that his task was to produce additional or contradictory evidence rather than to form an overview which took into account all relevant material.\" 2 Dr Cortizo was said to be \"quick to nd opportunities to allege bias on the part of witnesses for the informant but, despite his skills at diversionary tactics, that approach, or rather the justi cation for it, did not survive cross-examination.\" 2 Generally, expert witnesses called by the Commission found favor with Judge Moore. He found that Professor Swinburn \"adopted apt strategies and limitations, and that the work and study which lay behind his evidence was carried out skilfully, painstakingly, logically and with integrity.\" 2 Professor Mann was said, like Professor Swinburn, to be \"calm, measured, analytical and detached.\" 2 Dr Barling \"presented as a very relaxed man, entirely comfortable with who he was and where he was at.\"2 Before convicting the defendant on 26 charges, Judge Moore summarized the expert evidence.

Coulter, PhD; John Walsh, LLMALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 61 Randomized Controlled Trials and the Lawwould it be to conduct a randomised control [ sic] trial of a weight loss product such as Body Enhancer?\" Professor Swinburn replied, \"It would be extremely simple actually.\" 2 In his evidence, Professor Mann stated that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is \"an integral part of evidence based medicine and should wherever possible inform medical opinion and practice\" and that \"several RCTs reviewed by a panel of appropriately experienced professionals or reanalysed statistically in a meta-analysis is regarded as the highest level of evidence.\" 2 He noted that RCTs on the effect of vitamin E on humans had reversed earlier research on animals that had indicated that vitamin E could favorably improve several risk factors for coronary heart disease and stated that \"there is no reason evidence [ sic] why the reported ingredients of Body Enhancer or indeed the product itself could not or should not be assessed using strict RCT procedures.\" 2 He saw such a trial as \"conceptually simple, it would probably be moderately costly.\"2 Professor Mann went on to note that even after a compound has been tested in several RCTs, several factors, such as form of delivery, route of delivery, matrix, form of the compound, purity of the compound, quantity/dose, and physiological state of the recipient should be considered when assessing claims about ef cacy. 2 Although Judge Moore emphasized with respect to all of the charges that \"a conviction can be entered only if the informant proves the guilt of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt\" 2 and that \"there is no obligation on the defendant to prove its innocence or to prove anything else,\"2 he included the following in his judgment: One of the noteworthy features of the evidence before the Court is that, other than the references to dexfenflu-ramine and orlistat (Zenical [sic] ) it does not include even a reference to any properly conducted clinical stud-ies as to the efficacy of extensively marketed weight loss products, whether patented or not. Yet on the evidence before this Court, sales of Colorad long ago exceeded $US200 million. If success had been achieved in the commercial exploitation of any one of the many patents before the Court, it would be surprising if that had not given rise to properly conducted double blind clinical trials to provide a foundation, not only for the advertis-ing of therapeutic claims, but the re-launch of the prod-uct as a recognized medicine, able to be prescribed by doctors. There is, of course, nothing of the sort. 2 He noted that it was only when faced with prosecution that Zenith took any steps to obtain a controlled trial of the product, and had then contacted a person he described as an \"entrepreneur-ial doctor \"2 rather than a reputable organization with the skills nec- essary for the proper design, conduct, and analysis of such a trial. Noting that there is more than 1 accepted scale of classi cation of clinical studies and similar research, he nevertheless saw \"double blind randomised controlled trials in which neither the study par-ticipants nor those directly involved in the conduct of the trial know whether any particular participant is receiving a placebo or the substance being tested\" 2 as the \"gold standard.\" THE LAW AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS Was the judge on good grounds adopting such a stance? To answer this we need to examine the nature of science itself and in particular the RCT. Although the Cochrane Collaboration lists more than 4000 CAM-related RCTs in its database, 3 many manu- facturers and distributors of complementary and alternative treatments cannot afford to conduct such a trial. RCTs are gener-ally conducted by manufacturers of conventional medicines, most often to satisfy the US Food and Drug Administration, which decides whether a manufacturer has provided \"substantial evidence\" from \"adequate and well-controlled investigations\" that a drug is effective for its intended use. 4 This decision has usually been based on more than 1 RCT. This procedure has not escaped criticism. Research can be falsi ed but because of the possible criminal and civil penalties, harm to reputation, and a possible continuing absence of trust by the regulating authorities, such falsi cation is generally avoid-ed, if only because \"there may be ways short of fraud to control the outcome of research.\" 5(p123) Those ways include biases in the design of a research study and in the reporting of such a study, either or both of which may be related to the so-called \"funding effect\"\u2014the name for the fact that \"strong and consistent evi- dence shows that industry sponsored research draws pro-industry conclusions.\" 6(p59) In addition to these objections, there are other, more philosophical objections to the primacy of the RCT. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS In opting for the RCT as the gold standard, Judge Moore wan- dered into the field of evidence-based practice, at the heart of which is the RCT. The de nition formulated for evidence-based medicine is that it is \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best avail-able external clinical evidence from systematic research.\" 7(p1085) The dominant focus of evidence-based practice has been the RCT. However, it is not the single RCT that is the gold standard; rather it is the systematic review of trials that is the most signi -cant, particularly those that result in a meta-analysis. 8 In fact, the results of even a double-blinded trial can be misleading, particu-larly if the number of subjects is insuf cient to power the study (ie, give it statistical legitimacy). Meta-analysis overcomes that problem by combining studies that are homogeneous so that the subject pool is larger. Although other forms of study design may be included in a systematic literature review (non-random trials, cohort studies, and simple pre/post case series) the RCT is given most weight since it is the design that most clearly establishes efficacy. Unfortunately, such studies generally test a therapy under ideal conditions and often with homogeneous populations to ensure 62 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Randomized Controlled Trials and the Lawcomparability of the groups when comparing outcomes. But evidence-based practice ultimately requires therapies that can be applied in normal practice, that is, effectiveness studies. 9 Just as a therapy without any ef cacy will not be effective, a therapy that demonstrates efficacy in a study may not be effective when applied to heterogeneous populations under normal practice conditions. Furthermore, therapies with equal or comparable ef cacy may differ considerably in terms of effectiveness. In contrast, however, RCTs test therapies under ideal condi- tions 10 and therefore do not often help with determining effective- ness in everyday practice as opposed to ef cacy in a controlled, and usually perfect, setting. There are some very strict ethical lim-itations to conducting clinical trials that prevent certain popula-tions from participating. If there is a very high risk but low bene t for a sub-group of patients, this might mitigate against them being included (such as patients with high co-morbidities). Conversely, some low-risk patients may not be included because too large a number would need to be enrolled to make the study feasible. 11 The end result, therefore, is that clinically it is not pos- sible to know if the therapy can be applied to groups that were not included in the trial. Although providers do treat populations, they treat them one at a time. RCTs seldom contain the \"soft data\" about individ-ual variations, particularly in response to therapy. The type of clinical detail essential for a provider to decide whether a given patient is a candidate for a drug, procedure, or therapy is seldom provided in an RCT. 12 RCTs provide the results of average patients and even then it is an average of those who meet the inclusion cri-teria. This problem can be solved through observational studies. There is a dilemma, however, about the role of observational studies. On the one hand, they may seem more clinically relevant and include the populations and sub-populations of interest to the health provider, but on the other they do not provide the type of de nitive evidence that might persuade the provider to recom-mend the procedure to the patient. Despite this ambivalence, observational studies continue to be widely published. Ray, in a 2-month survey in 1998 of 3 leading medical journals, found that observational studies comprised 68% to 87% of their featured articles and communications, and only 32%, 13%, and 26% of their publications were RCTs. 13 He notes that although we do not know how observational studies impact practice or policy, given their propensity to publish them, these journals must feel that observational studies are important to their readers. One solution to the dilemma in evidence-based practice has been to create a hierarchy of evidence. A standard hierarchy is the following (from the highest to the lowest): evidence provided by at least 1 appropriately designed RCT; evidence provided by a controlled trial that is not randomized; evidence provided by a well-designed cohort or case-control study; evidence provided by a multiple time series, descriptive studies, case reports, and opin-ions of experts or respected authorities. 14 There is an expanding body of literature on studies examin- ing RCTs and observational studies for the same disease and intervention. As Iaonnidis et al note, earlier studies concluded that nonrandomized studies overestimated treatment bene ts. 15 More recently, the studies show that both randomized and non-randomized studies yield very similar results. Their own study found a very good correlation between the 2 but that the nonran-domized studies did show larger treatment effects. Interestingly, they found that heterogeneity was frequent between studies in both groups. Benson and Hartz found little evidence of a differ-ence in the treatment effects between RCTs and observational studies when the comparison was made for the same treatment. 16 Concato, Shah, and Horwitz found in their study that in the 5 topics they examined where there were bodies of both RCTs and observation studies, the results of well-designed observation studies did not systematically exaggerate the magnitude of the effects of treatment compared to the RCTs for the same topic. 17 They concluded that their results challenge the hierarchy of evi-dence being used in clinical research (and systematic reviews). Those studies with either a cohort or case control design did not overestimate the outcomes and the results of the RCTs and these studies were very similar. In fact, the observational studies have less variability in point estimates than did the RCTs. This also meant their results were less heterogeneous. Discrepancies in RCTs and between RCTs and meta-analyses have been noted previously. 18 This makes using a single RCT as the gold standard for care a questionable approach. As Concato, Shah, and Horwitz note, because of the inclusion and exclusion criterion used in RCTs, an observational study is more likely to include a broader representation of the population. 17 They also note that earlier studies comparing observation studies and RCTs had included all types of observation studies in the comparison. If, however, the comparison is made with cohort and case control studies, the superiority of RCTs is not so clear. Of course, such a conclusion raises the question of whether there is a hierarchy of observational evidence. Stroup et al have put forward a proposal for improving the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in an attempt to answer the question of the quality of observation studies. 19 According to LeLorier et al, the recent research has begun to assert that quality observation studies are no more misleading than RCTs. 17 The popular belief that only RCTs produce trustwor- thy results and that all observational studies are misleading does a disservice to patient care, clinical investigations, and the educa-tion of healthcare professionals. MEDICINE AND EVIDENCED-BASED PRACTICE There is considerable debate about how much of clinical practice is evidenced-based. The initial estimates by the Of ce of Technology Assessment in 1978 20 and 198321 were that only about 10% to 20% of medicine could claim to be evidenced-based. As noted by Imrie and Ramey, 22 this gure was simply an estimate.23 They further note that other commentators have given gures as low as 15% for practices based on any evidence. The problem of establishing any figure is you first need to define what will constitute the evidence. How you do that has a great impact on the result. If, for example, you demand only 1 good single RCT, ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 63 Randomized Controlled Trials and the Lawthe figure will be much higher than if you required repeated RCTs. The use of a single RCT, no matter how good the study, does pose methodological problems. Single studies can be contradicted by later studies. To overcome the problem of a single study, studies are pooled if they are homogeneous enough to permit a meta-analysis. This also greatly increases the sample sizes on which analyses can be done. 24,25 Examples of misleading meta-analysis have been documented in the literature.26 Furthermore, studies with negative results are less likely to be published. This has a tremendous impact on the \"evidence.\" 27,28 THE JUDGE AND THE SCIENCE When a judge opts to accept the opinion of some scienti c experts, he is in fact opting for the lowest ranked of all scienti c knowledge in evidence-based practice. He is also supporting 1 scientific paradigm over others\u2014in this case, evidence-based practice\u2014and elevating 1 form of research design, the RCT, over all other forms. 29 The problem with all this is there is good evi- dence that expert opinion is shaky at best and frequently down-right wrong; there is an increasing body of research that questions whether the RCT is the gold standard the experts claim it to be. There is considerable evidence to suggest that medicine itself (or at least about 80% of it) could not meet the standard of evidence supported by RCTs and, last but not least, there is no evidence that evidence-based practice, where it does exist, results in better patient outcomes. In the face of this, how has the law dealt with expert opinion? EXPERT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE In common law, the general rule is that witnesses cannot offer opinion as evidence; one exception to that rule is that suf - ciently quali ed expert witnesses may give opinion evidence on matters within their area of expertise. That exception is in turn circumscribed by a series of subsidiary rules: the \"common knowl-edge\" rule, that such an expert cannot give evidence on a matter within the knowledge of the nder of fact; the \"ultimate issue\" rule, that such an opinion is inadmissible if it is an issue the nder of fact must determine; the \"factual basis\" rule, that the facts upon which the opinion of the expert is based must be proved by admissible evidence. There is considerable consensus internation-ally about the circumstances in which such evidence, particularly when it includes novel or controversial ingredients, can be intro-duced and considered in court. In R v Calder , 30 introducing the topic of expert evidence of new scienti c techniques or theories by quoting an Australian text that stated that \"the issue of how to deal with areas that have not yet fully emerged from their devel-opmental stages remains unsolved,\" 31 Judge Tipping examined authorities from England,32,33 Canada, Australia, and the United States. In Canada, in R v Johnstone,34 14 points were seen as rele- vant to whether scientific evidence, if challenged, should be admitted or excluded; in R v Melarangi , 35 9 points, some of which were the same as or similar to those in Johnstone were deemed rel- evant. In Australia, in R v Lucas,36 Judge Hampel urged caution with respect to the introduction of challenged scienti c evidence, referring to United States v Baller,37 in which it was noted that \"because of its apparent objectivity, an opinion which claims a sci-enti c basis is apt to carry undue weight with the trier of fact.\" In the United States, the leading authority for many years had been Frye v United States, 38 in which \"general acceptance\" of a scienti c technique or theory was required. That test had been the subject of considerable criticism, and the Supreme Court of the United States revisited the topic in light of the Federal Rules of Evidence in Daubert v Merill Dow Pharmaceuticals, 39 in which it was decided that the \"general acceptance\" test in Frye was not a necessary pre-condition to admissibility. Among the factors the court recognized as relevant to whether expert scienti c testimony should be considered was general acceptance, but other factors, such as peer review and publication, whether the theory or technique can be or had been tested, and potential or known rate of error, were also regarded as relevant to the question. The court saw the judge as playing a \"gate keeping\" role and believed that vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof were appropriate methods to attack shaky but admissible evidence. Judge Tipping also received assistance from a New Zealand Law Commission discussion paper 40 that\u2014although recom- mending that scienti c evidence should be assessed for reliabili-ty, including the reliability of the underlying theory and the reliability of the procedures and techniques used in a particular case\u2014nevertheless contended that a theory need not be accepted by all or even most scientists in an area to be admissible, and that theories that were new or represented the views of a minori-ty could be reliable and helpful. The discussion paper contended that procedures ought to conform to acceptable scienti c stan-dards, but that an opinion need not be conclusive in order to be admitted into evidence. In Calder , Judge Tipping ultimately decided that, to be admitted, such expert evidence should be rel-evant, helpful, and more probative than prejudicial; relevant, as in tending to show that a fact in issue is more or less likely; help-ful, as in passing a \"minimum threshold of reliability\" test in that the proponent of the evidence demonstrates that it has suf cient claim to reliability to be admitted. Once the threshold has been crossed, the weight of the evidence and its probative force can be tested in cross-examination and counter evidence. Judge Tipping acknowledged that the \"suf cient claim to reliability\" test could be too general to be of much assistance, but saw fl exibility as a desirable ingredient; the points set out in the Canadian cases Johnstone 34 and Melarangi35 could be useful in deciding whether the threshold had been crossed. Whether the judge, as gatekeep-er, opened the door or kept it shut in any individual case would depend on a wide variety of subsidiary issues. CONCLUSION Imagine that a corporation, instead of selling a weight-loss product, sold \"retroactive prayer\" and claimed that such prayer, offered from 4 to 10 years after an event, can affect outcomes. A randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group study 41 64 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Randomized Controlled Trials and the Lawincluding 3393 patients considered the hypothesis that such ret- roactive prayer affects outcomes. The study concluded that, although mortality was similar in both groups, length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were shorter with such prayer. Although there may be all kinds of other evidence, should that RCT evidence be conclusive were the corporation to be charged with a contravention of the Fair Trading Act 1986, or should the judge consider all of the evidence tendered? In deciding what evi-dence should be considered, it is tting to conclude with another quotation from John Steinbeck, this time referring to one of Ed Ricketts' ctional alter egos, \"Doc,\" in the novel Sweet Thursday, in which the local inhabitants decide to bid Doc farewell with a gift, knowing that he wants a new microscope for his laboratory. Doc looked at the gift\u2014a telescope strong enough to bring the moon to his lap. His mouth fell open. Then he smothered the laughter that rose in him. \"Like it?\" said Mack.\"It's beautiful.\"\"Biggest one in the whole goddam catalogue,\" said Mack.Doc's voice was choked.\"Thanks,\" he said. \"After all, I guess it doesn't matter whether you look down or up\u2014as long as you look.\" 42(p263-264) REFERENCES 1.

I had great dif culties in going through school. Because of that, I always had the feeling something was wrong with me. I was very tuned in. I could read people very well, but to concentrate on a 2-dimensional task like looking at a book all day was hard for me. I would start reading, and I'd feel very dis-tracted or I would fall asleep. However, I had excellent eyesight. Whenever my parents took me to the eye doctor, the doctor would say, \"His eyes are perfect.\" No one ever put it together that the dif culties that I was having in the classroom were in any way related to my vision because vision was de ned as eyesight, and I had 20/20. When I got out of high school and I entered college, about 10 days into the rst semester the teacher gave us a pop quiz. I was sitting in the back of the class because my eyesight had always been excellent. In the middle of the test, I looked up at the black-board, and the blackboard all of a sudden was fuzzy. And it stayed fuzzy. I got very frightened; I didn't know what was wrong. I n- ished the test and then went to the eye doctor at the in rmary. The doctor examined me and said, \"Oh, you're just near- sighted.\" He didn't tell me that my near-sightedness was just a minute amount, and he never mentioned that I had had a spasm in my accommodative or focusing system from doing so much close work, which is, of course, what happens when you're in col-lege. He gave me glasses. I was just grateful I didn't have some pathology. So I started wearing glasses, and I could see the black-board, but I still couldn't read for longer than I'd been able to before. In fact, reading became ever more uncomfortable. Every 6 months or so, I would notice that I couldn't see the blackboard anymore, so I had to keep getting stronger and stron-ger glasses. But nothing was changing in terms of my ability to read and learn with greater ease. When I got into optometry school, the reading demand increased significantly, and I was barely getting by between working to pay my way through school and having a full school load\u2014optometry school is basically the same pre-med as you get in a medical school. It's very intense. The rst 2 years, I was so close to not getting by that I actually thought they would not allow me to go into my third year. But they did. When I entered my third year, which is when you start your clinical training, they sent me down to the clinic, and they asked one of the fourth-year doctors to examine me. They gave me a Jacob Liberman, OD, PhD , received a doctorate of optometry in 1973 from Southern College of Optometry, Memphis, Tennessee; a PhD in Vision Science in 1986 from The College of Syntonic Optometry, Leadville, Colorado; and an honorary doctorate of science in 1996 from The Open International University for Complementary Medicines.

CONVERSATIONS68 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDvision exam, and the young man told me the same thing every- one before him had told me: \"Y ou need a stronger pair of glass-es.\" But he also said, \"Y ou know you're having some problems using your eyes together and that could be in some way affecting your comfort during reading.\" He suggested that I do some vision exercises. He gave me a little device and I took it home, but I never used it. I just stuck it in the corner of my room. One day I was doing an assignment and after a few minutes of reading, the same thing happened that always happened: I fell asleep. When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was the device at the other end of the room. I had a revelation. Something said, \"Pick it up.\" I picked it up. I did 1 exercise on it for no more than 4 or 5 minutes and then I read for an hour, non-stop, with the most perfect attention and comprehension I had ever experi-enced in my life. It hit me so hard that I start- ed crying because my whole life, I thought I was stupid. I did the rec-ommended protocol for about 2 months and then made the dean's list every quarter until I graduated. I went from a 2.0 average to end-ing up in the top 10% of my class. That was my rst profound experience with the fact that vision is much more than eye-sight, and that just because we have 2 eyes open doesn't mean that they're both being used. Y ou have 2 legs, but if you had use of only 1 of them, it would create a huge imbalance in your life. The same is true with your vision. If both eyes are not working together ef ciently, it will affect your comfort and performance in a very signi cant way. Additionally, if one's vision is functioning excellently, his response to life will be perfectly timed, so if he's playing base-ball, the bat will be swung at the right moment, will hit the ball on the sweet spot and even if he doesn't hit the ball hard, it'll go a great distance. That's great vision. So vision is not so much what you see, it's what you do with what you see. It's your response to life. That rst experience, which happened in 1971, changed my life. ATHM: What was your next step in getting to where you are today? Dr Liberman: In my rst several years of practicing optometry, I was very involved in working with young children and teenagers who had dif culties with learning because that was something that I knew by heart\u2014that was my own story. I worked with thousands of kids. And in late 1975, the thought came to me: \"I wonder if there's anything that I can do that could in some way improve my eyesight.\" Because when I went to school, I wasn't taught that vision could affect everything; it was just an optical system, a camera inside the head. We were taught that eyes got worse because they were too long or too short or oddly shaped. The idea that vision could be improved was never discussed. One of the rst things that is taught in medical school is that the body is always seeking homeostasis, always seeking balance. We know health means balance. Y ou could say that the heartbeat of life, of the universe, of the human body is a continu-al movement toward equilibrium. I call it homeodynamics. It's not really homeostasis; it's just a continual movement, a search for balance. This is probably why in science we say, \"The only constant is change.\" That change is the continual adjustment of the inside of the body to the environ-ment. We know the body has the ability to self-heal, but for some reason or other, this is an unknown concept in the area of vision. Vision specialists know that very few people enter this world needing glasses or seeing poorly\u2014prob-ably less than 1%. Yet by the end of fth grade, more than 80% of kids have mea-surable vision dif culties. In many places where education is stressed, like Israel, Asia, and the United States, by the time kids are 16 or 17, well over 80% are near-sighted. The biggest health epidemic in the world right now is deteriorating eye-sight, and yet all we do is give glasses or contacts. If you look at the records of any vision specialist in the world, you'll notice that the moment a patient begins to wear glasses, his eyes continue to deteriorate. What I've always said is, if the problem gets worse, the solution can't possibly be the solution. And yet we're not looking for the causative factor. We're looking at using glasses or contacts or doing surgical interven-tion like LASIK as a way of neutralizing the problem, but we're still not looking for the cause, and we're still not broadening our idea of what vision is beyond the concept of eyesight. So in 1976, I started doing vision training on myself a few minutes a day and rather than continually increasing the prescription of my glasses, which is what my history for 10 years had been, I began reducing my prescription very subtly every 6 to 8 weeks, gradu-ally allowing myself to adjust to a weaker prescription as my vision skills improved. I also spent time without my glasses on, just to notice how it felt internally when I wasn't wearing them. I wasn't primarily concerned with whether I could see or couldn't see, but rather how I felt emotionally. I noticed that I started feeling out of con-trol and edgy without my glasses on and noticed that wearing the ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT IS TAUGHT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL IS THAT THE BODY IS ALWAYS SEEKING BALANCE.ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 69 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDglasses masked a lot of these symptoms. After a while I noticed that when I was able to take the glasses off for longer and longer periods of time, I got more and more comfortable with a lot of these feelings and as my comfort increased, my eyesight started to change. Within 8 or 9 months of doing this, my eyesight improved about 200% to 300%. I also had a revelation during a meditative experience that led me to recognize that vision was something way beyond eyesight. The combination of those experiences allowed me to see clearly without my glasses on. That happened in 1976 when I was 29. I just turned 60 in November and have never worn a pair of glasses for any purpose since that day. I don't wear glasses for distance or for read-ing and personally don't nd a need for sunglasses. I uncovered something through my own personal process that has allowed me to see vision in a whole new way and to recognize that if you can optimize your vision, it can have life-transforming effects. Vision accounts for about 90% of the infor-mation human beings take in during their lifetime. Vision is not so much what we see, it's what we do with what we see; it's the body's naviga-tional system. So when we optimize vision, we're not talking about opti-mizing eyesight only, we're talking about optimizing the ability of the eyes to aim, focus, track, and work together as a team. ATHM: Can you explain those functions in detail? Dr Liberman: These 4 functions\u2014aiming, focusing, tracking, and teaming\u2014occur simultaneously and are inseparably con-nected to one's consciousness. To give you an example, when you are speaking with someone and they're paying attention to you, how do you know they're paying attention to you? Y ou know because they're looking at you. In order to attend, to be present, the eyes must converge upon that which is of interest. When the eyes aim or converge, they simultaneously focus. This process is inseparably connected with our ability to selective-ly attend and be present. In other words, aiming and focusing the eyes is required for us to both suppress external noise and quiet the mind. This is extremely important because being present and attentive is the most fundamental function involved in learning. This is also why most meditative practices have you focus on something. Even though the eyes are closed, they say, \"Focus on a mantra. Focus on the third eye. Focus on something.\" When we think of the word focus , we think of an optical sys- tem. But to say something is in focus is to say it is clear. That's why people say \"I see\" to indicate that they understand some-thing. Seeing is inseparably connected with understanding. Aiming lays the foundation for presence and effortless attention, while focusing provides a sense of clarity and knowing. Next comes tracking, which occurs at the same time as aim- ing and focusing. We say the only constant is change. So as things in the environment enter our eld of awareness, the eyes are auto- matically moved toward them. It's an effortless process because light and the eye are married. When light strikes the eye, the eye automatically moves toward it in the same way as a fl ower turns its face toward the sun. Tracking is the process of continually moving the eyes from one moment to the next as things in the environment call our attention. So the eyes simultaneously aim, focus, track, and work togeth-er as a team. The teaming aspect of vision is very important because having 2 eyes gives us the ability to have stereoscopic or 3-dimensional vision. Dr Arnold Gesell, who at one time was the leading child-development expert in the world and who founded the Gesell Institute of Child Development at Yale, said that stereoscopic vision was the crown jewel of organic evolution. He said it was the most highly developed aspect of our neurological system. Having 2 eyes not only gives us the ability to see depth, it also allows us to determine what's foreground and what's back-ground, what's most important and what's less important at that moment. It lets us know where we are in space in relation to other things. Good eyesight is the ability, for instance, of a baseball player to see the pitcher clearly. Good vision is the ability of that player to track the baseball at 95 or 100 miles per hour from the pitcher's hand to the plate and be so integrated that his arms and body move at the exact moment necessary for the bat to hit the ball. In the classroom, that level of vision provides a child the abil- ity to effortlessly attend, allows the eyes to move smoothly across a line of print, so that reading and comprehension and attention become something that's fun and easy. If a child is having any dif- culty with these functions, learning becomes very dif cult. ATHM: Given your explanation of how big the definition of vision can be, what is creating this epidemic of young people not being able to see clearly? Dr Liberman: I'll tell you exactly what it is. Y ou live in Boulder, Colorado, a place where there's a lot of expanse, a lot of space. When people step outside, most will breathe a sigh of relief because their eyes can escape all the way out to in nity. Y ou know Vision is not so much what we see, it's what we do with what we see; it's the body's navi-gational system.70 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 14, NO. 2 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDhow sometimes it's a little more dif cult to breathe deeply when you enter a small space such as an elevator? Well, we have 2 eyes in order to be able to see all the way out to in nity. However, if your visual space is con ned, your body begins to show signs of stress. If you, for instance, put an animal in a visually con ning environment, so that its eyes can look only as far away as 18 or 20 inches, that animal will become myopic. A high percentage of sail-ors that are in a submarine for a month or 6 weeks are near-sighted when they come out. Their near-sightedness may reverse, but visual con nement creates a constriction in vision. Most of the epidemic of near-sightedness that we have today is because the demand on the eyes is for reading and learning. Most people spend a good part of their day either looking at a book 16 to 20 inches away or, even more commonly today, look-ing at a computer monitor. Many school children sit in window-less classrooms. Many people work in cubicles or in offices without windows. The major problem is that our eyes are very often con ned to a close distance, so they adjust to that distance because that is what society says is important for us to succeed. If our neurologi-cal system were designed for a 2-dimensional world, we would only require 1 eye in the center of our head. The reason we have 2 eyes is to give us 3-dimensionality. In other words, our entire neu-rophysiology is designed for a 3-dimensional world. When you read or work on a computer, you are restricted to 2 dimensions. If you take a system that is designed for 3-dimensionality and primarily use it for 2-dimensional tasks, it creates stress. Studies that were done many years ago found that when chil-dren read a book, their pulse rate, respiration rate, etc\u2014all the markers of stress\u2014signi cantly increase. If you go into cultures around the world where people don't go to school and don't do a lot of reading, you see that near-sightedness is unheard of. Look at Eskimos, for instance: before Alaska institutionalized education, myopia was unheard of. However, as soon as Eskimos were required to go to school and read, there was a signi cant onset of myopia. So the epidemic of deteriorating eyesight is caused primarily by the stress created by visual confinement. And the major source of visual con nement responsible for that stress is the cul-tural demand to sit and look at a book or a computer all day. ATHM: What do you see as the remedy? \"Our entire neurophysiology is designed for a 3-dimensional world. When you read or work on a computer, you are restricted to 2 dimensions. \"\"If you go into cultures around the world where people don't go to school and don't do a lot of reading, you see that near-sightedness is unheard of.\"ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 71 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDDr Liberman: There are 3 remedies that I immediately see. First we need to rede ne what it means to see. People need to become aware that vision is much more than just eyesight. Next, I see 2 very practical remedies. In 1928, a group of visionary optometrists developed the science of functional optometry and vision training. They realized that vision is seam-lessly connected with behavior and performance. And since vision affects every human function, they developed a behavioral science called behavioral optometry. Today there are thousands of doctors who practice this type of care, and one of the major things they do, aside from vision training, is to prescribe stress-reducing glasses for kids to use in school for learning. These are not glasses that are prescribed because of poor eyesight. These are glasses that magnify very slightly and have a measurable stress-reducing effect. They func-tion like a wedge. Let's say you're cutting a tree down and want the tree to move in a certain direction. Strategically placing a wedge of wood on one side helps the tree to fall in the desired direction. When we want the vision system to begin to normalize or move in a direction opposite of the way it's moving, we fre-quently use what we call a wedge prescription. It's a very small- powered magnifying lens that reduces visual stress and is used primarily for classroom work and reading. That by itself is a wonderful preventive tool. It's a practical application that very often prevents the onset of myopia. The most important recommendation is vision training. Consider the value of doing something like yoga, Pilates, or gyro-tonics, some sort of exercise that maintains the body's fl exibility. If we began doing yoga as children, a little bit each day, not as an exercise but as just a part of our life, as we got older a lot of that fl exibility would be maintained. The difference between youth and older age often is a loss of fl exibility. If fl exibility can be maintained in the body, then I think that it has a direct effect on not only our physical comfort but on our longevity and our well-being. The same is true with vision. Another very effective tool is a little bookmark that I devel- oped in 1976. It has a stop sign on top and says, \"Stop. Look up. Look away. Breathe. Put me 2 pages ahead.\" So that every time you get to that bookmark, you take a little break, just enough time to look up, look away, let the eyes escape, and relax the focusing system. If we merely gave each child in school one of these bookmarks, that in itself would make a very signi cant change in terms of the onset and progression of myopia. If we just did a few simple vision-training exercises each day, along with using stress-reducing glasses for close work, I believe we would probably prevent most myopia. Beyond the prevention of vision deterioration, this approach would also optimize and expand our ability to see and learn. We would attend better with less effort. We could read lon- ger and more comfortably. Learning would be easier, sports per-formance would soar, and working at the computer would be more comfortable. ATHM: How do you envision making these vision-training prac- tices more widespread? Dr Liberman: For years my dream has been to bring this awareness to the public. If I share these suggestions and skills with athletes, for instance, it signi cantly improves their game. Whether it's baseball, golf, or tennis, athletes know that the key to peak performance, aside from physical conditioning, is their vision. And the same is true in the classroom. Our eyes guide everything we do. We are now introducing this work to school systems, sports teams, computer users, pilots, and police recruit training pro-grams. It's a whole new paradigm, and the timing couldn't be any better. It's not only because we're losing our eyesight as a species, but also one of the biggest epidemics today is attention de cit disorder (ADD) and attention de cit hyperactivity disor-der (ADHD). Millions of children and adults are being medicat-ed because they have great dif culty attending comfortably. I cannot tell you the huge difference someone can experience in their ability to attend, read, and learn by doing some very simple vision exercises. To make that available to people, I developed a clinically proven device that can signi cantly improve those skills. And it's \"If we just did a few simple vision-training exercises each day, along with using stress-reducing glasses for close work, I believe we would probably prevent most myopia.\"72 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDbacked up by peer-reviewed published research. What's really interesting is that someone can spend less than 10 minutes a day doing these exercises and experience very broad effects\u2014every-thing from improving visual attention and reading ef ciency and comprehension to how comfortably they work at the computer and play their favorite sport. Vision training has far-reaching effects, and very soon this information will permeate every area of life because as someone once said, \"Next to life itself, God's most precious gift is sight.\" When we think about vision, what it means to see, it's not just an optical process. Our vision is deeply rooted in our humanity. A large part of my last 35 years of work has dealt with the effect of light on the mind, body, and spirit. Now I'm focusing on light, vision, consciousness, and performance and how all these things are connected. What I've discovered is that they are insep-arable. Changing one's vision can truly change one's life. One of the most powerful movements today is a drive toward personal growth and development. We read self-help books in an attempt to see and understand our lives more clearly. We try to be more conscious about our diet, exercising regularly and taking supplements in hopes of ful lling our vision of better health. We meditate as a way of nding inner peace and new vision. In our own way, we are all trying to improve the quality of our lives by seeing life more clearly. Yet very few of us have con-sidered the role of vision training in expanding our ability to see. That's what my interest is, and I've developed a technology that I feel can really support people in that process. ATHM: Where can readers go to learn more about resources in this area? Dr Liberman: There is a lot of information available through the Optometric Extension Program Foundation, OEP.org, and the College of Optometrists in Vision Development, COVD.org. OEP is the organization that started the science of behavioral optome-try and vision training in 1928. This is a science that's been incor-porated into the optometric profession for more than 80 years. COVD is the certifying body for doctors of optometry who spe-cialize in the art and science of vision training. ATHM: Can you tell us more about the device you created and how it works? Dr Liberman: The device is called the EYEPORT Vision Training System, and people can nd out about it at our website, www.exerciseyoureyes.com. The EYEPORT has been cleared by the FDA and is the rst clinically proven device available to the pub-lic that improves overall visual performance. The EYEPORT has a series of alternating red and blue LEDs that the user tracks horizontally, vertically, diagonally, and from far to near and back. Our patent deals with a very speci c effect that occurs when the eye looks at red vs when it looks at blue. These colors have opposing effects on the autonomic nervous system as well as the aiming and focusing mechanism of the eyes. Red causes the eyes to refl exively over-focus, while blue causes them to refl exively under-focus. When you alternately look at red and blue lights, you create rocking action\u2014a rhythmic expansion and contraction, simulat-ing the body's natural state of flow. There's a reason we rock babies. It puts them into a state of ease. If you close your eyes and tune into your body, you will notice that the most fundamental rhythm is that the body continually expands and contracts\u2014the breathing cycle. If you go a little deeper into the body, you will notice that same continual expansion and contraction in the heart. That rhythm is then transmitted to the vascular system, the organs, the glands, and the cells. The whole body is continually expand-ing and contracting. We say the only constant is change\u2014that's called fl o w . When that's going on, the body is in a state of physio- logical coherence. Every time we think, try hard, or put effort into something, the breath is momentarily held and restricted. When that occurs, the muscles get tight, mind-body integration is broken, and one's visual eld begins to collapse. We see less, experience less, and become less ef cient because the fl ow is gone. What is the fl ow? The fl ow is what's described and de ned by the statement, \"The only constant is change.\" It's the homeodynamic heartbeat of the human energy system. By viewing the alternating red and blue lights on the EYEPORT, you create an involuntary expansion and contraction within the eye and the nervous system, reminding the body of its most primal rhythm and natural state of fl ow. And while the system is expanding and contracting, the eyes are simultaneously aiming, focusing, tracking, and teaming, which means these skills are being trained and reinforced with-out effort. It's occurring within a state of fl ow. When this occurs for an athlete, they're \"in the zone.\" And when they're in the zone, something special happens. The most important aspect of our technology is that it encourages and allows the mind-body system to re-experience its natural state of fl ow, while visual function is enhanced. This is extremely important because when the mind/body is in a state of fl ow, it's at its maximum potential and re-experiences its ability to function and perform without effort. ATHM: How successful has the system been? Dr Liberman: So far, we have 3 published studies in peer- reviewed journals, all of which demonstrate that using the device for less than 10 minutes a day\u2014 ve 90-second exercises\u2014signi -cantly improves visual attention; reading ef ciency and compre-hension; aiming, focusing, tracking, and teaming of the eyes; speed and span of perception; dynamic depth perception; marks-manship; and sports performance. That's what the studies have demonstrated, whether the subjects are medical school students, Little League baseball play-ers, or police recruits. We've also completed a pilot study at a university dealing with using the EYEPORT on kids who have ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 73 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDbeen diagnosed with ADHD. Even though it was only a pilot study, we found statistically signi cant improvement in visual attention and focusing ability after using the device less than 10 minutes a day over 3 weeks\u2014which means that these children used the EYEPORT for less than 3 hours total. The other thing that's really interesting is that most of the change remains even after you stop using the device. If you go to the gym and exercise your muscles, if you don't continue to exer-cise them, they become fl accid after awhile. In vision training, it is important to recognize that the eyes are direct frontal extensions of the brain. When you train the eyes, you're directly training the central nervous system. So you don't have to do this for the rest of your life. That's extremely impor-tant to me because if you have to do something for the rest of your life, there's a good chance you won't do it. Y ou see, if it takes effort to create change, it will take effort to maintain it. And if it takes effort to maintain it, you can pretty much be assured it will not be maintained because the body, just like the universe, functions by the law of parsimony\u2014it uses the least amount of energy to get the job done. When the subjects who took part in our studies were reevalu-ated 3 weeks afterwards, the level of performance was frequently just as high as and, in some cases, higher than it had been immedi-ately after the study. In other words, if the treatment is really working, one's vision and performance should continue to improve, not decline again. I don't want people to have to do something for the rest of their lives to get the bene t. I haven't done vision training in 31 years. I did it in 1976 and something changed about the way my vision worked and the way my brain was responding, and it has continued to improve. I do not see my vision getting worse; I actually see it getting better. That's inter-esting at 60. Y ou don't expect that. ATHM: How do you explain that? Dr Liberman: When you create greater balance between the eyes, you create greater balance in the brain and in the person's ability to nd balance in his or her life. Because you're training the brain, you're basically creating new, neuronal connections within the brain, and once people start using these skills the mere act of looking, reading, paying attention as they're driving, sitting in the classroom, or playing golf\u2014whatever they're doing\u2014continually reinforces the skills that they have learned.The device comes with a 3-month protocol that gives you the exact exercises to do every day. However, all of our studies were based on using the product less than 10 minutes a day, 6 days a week for 3 weeks. Recently, we started a large-scale study with the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission where we are incorporating the EYEPORT into police recruit training because we nd that the recruits respond much faster, much more accurately, and much more appropriately. We're talk-ing about enhancing performance in everyday life, but when someone is in a stressful situation, like police of cers are, they can't afford to respond inappro-priately. It could mean their lives or the life of someone else. Eventually, we want to introduce this into the armed forces, so that people who are under high levels of stress can rely on their vision to respond quickly, accurately, and effort-lessly, allowing them to respond more appropriately regardless of the situation they're in. We're trying to introduce not only this device but the concept of spend-ing a couple minutes each day optimizing visual function so that your eyes can guide you in the best possible way. So much of our success in the world is related to how we see and respond to life. When we opti-mize vision, we optimize our ability to perform. And when we optimize our ability to perform with minimal effort, we experience greater self-respect. This is especially true with children. One of our published studies was with a group of 12-year-old boys on a Little League team that was in the lowest division in their group of baseball teams. These kids used the device exactly as I mentioned, less than 10 min-utes a day for 3 weeks. They didn't practice individually, or as a group, and they had no games over this 3-week period. At the end of the study, the average player had a 90% improvement in batting performance. Not only that, but the team went from the lowest division to winning the champion-ship. Several of these children started doing better in school as well. Some people think, \"A kid can hit the ball better. How big a deal could that be?\" But when you don't experience success early in your life, as I didn't in my schoolwork, it can really dam-age your sense of self. In my personal experience, it wasn't until sometime in my 40s that I began to recognize that I was actually gifted in certain areas. I no longer have the reading problem that I had as a child, but at the time it really affected me. Over the past 35 years of doing this work, I have had the pleasure of working with thousands of people. Many of them So much of our success in the world is related to how we see and respond to life. When we optimize vision, we optimize our ability to perform.74 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDnotice a change after a single session. They can literally feel their eyes working in a different way. One of the greatest values of vision training is that it allows you to discover that eyesight is only a small aspect of how we see. It also allows you to see that you're not always looking where you think you're looking. For instance, let's say that you're playing golf, and you want to putt the ball into the hole. Most people assume that they're looking at the spot on the ball that they want to hit. However, most of the time, that's not the case. I started doing research on this in 1976 and discovered that about 70% of the population is not looking where they think they're looking. Most people are actually looking a little closer to or further away from where the ball really is. And that's why most people don't sink the putt or hit the home run more often. The unfortunate thing is that none of us can see how we're seeing, so we have no idea why our perfor-mance is less than expected. Another example of this same phenomenon is a group of people at an archery range. They all want to hit the bull's eye. They're sure that they are looking at the bull's eye, and they try hard to aim for its center. Yet very few of them actually hit the bull's eye. Isn't this the experience many of us have? We not only miss the bull's eye on the archery range, but often also in our lives. One of the beauties of vision training is that it creates a high level of congruity and alignment, so that your physical eye and your mind's eye are both focus-ing at the same point at the same time. When this occurs you experience a greater sense of timing and accuracy in everything you do. Y ou start hitting the ball on the sweet spot more consistently and experience greater success at whatever you're doing because there's greater focus and clarity in your life. ATHM: Y ou've elevated the whole conversation of vision from a visual organ system to a psycho-emotional experience and even to a spiritual organ. Dr Liberman: There is no question about that. When we talk about enhanced awareness or expanding consciousness, what are we talking about? We're talking about seeing things more clearly. Now, for some reason or other, we do not recognize that that level of seeing is inseparably connected with the seeing we're doing every day. But they are connected. They are absolutely con-nected because the thing that is seeing is not the eye; it's some-thing much deeper. The eye is just one part of the process. Vision and seeing are right at the heart of every spiritual tra- dition. Meditation is all about focusing on something. People do not connect that practice with the eyes, but whether the eyes are open or the eyes are closed, when you focus on something, your eyes also focus on the same thing. There's no way to separate these functions. We must begin to look at vision in a broader way because our eyes guide every move we make. The way we see, where we perceive things to be, how accurately we judge distance and the speed at which things are moving\u2014all of those fac-tors are reflected in our moment-by-moment response to life. Real vision is the ability to response automatically, without thought or effort. When that happens, our potential is expanded in ways that I cannot even describe. Improving visual performance directly affects performance on every level, but if you can sig-nificantly improve attention, reading, learning, and comfort of everyday use of the eyes, all of that together has a far great-er effect on how we feel about ourselves in the world. We can trust our vision to allow us to see situations in life more clear-ly. And when we see more clearly, we respond more accu-rately. We begin to trust our vision and ourselves, and that makes huge changes in our lives. If we begin training our vision as children, the effects stay with us through adulthood and permeate our lives. By doing a few simple vision exercises, you can begin to expe- riences your potential in a whole new way. I know this not only from my own experience but because I've had the pleasure of work-ing with thousands of adults and children over the past 35 years. And I'm not the only one. There are probably 6 thousand to 8 thousand behavioral optometrists around the country who also specialize in this work and have similar experiences. We are beginning to recognize the importance of this work because there's such an epidemic of vision deterioration. Additionally, children are experiencing more visual problems in the classroom in terms of reading and learning, and almost 90% of One of the beauties of vision training is that it creates a high level of congruity and alignment, so that your physical eye and your mind's eye are both focusing at the same point at the same time. ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, Mar/apr 2008, VOL. 14, NO. 2 75 Conversations: Jacob Liberman, OD, PhDcomputer users complain about their eyes. It's time to rede ne what it means to see and to incorporate techniques into our every-day life that can preserve our vision and also expand its potential. ATHM: Y ou've taken us into a visionary journey that's both extremely practical and, I believe, powerfully sacred. Do you have other recommendations you would like to share? Dr Liberman: It's very important, for instance, for children to have comprehensive vision examinations. I recommend they see a behavioral optometrist because a behavioral optometrist spe-cializes in preventive vision care and looks at vision not in terms of eyesight but in terms of performance. It's also important to check the health of the eyes, and optometrists are licensed to do that. But pathology is not very common in children. What is important to a child's vision is that it's working properly, that it's developing properly, and that the child is able to use it effectively. It is imperative that we think preventatively because hardly any-one escapes this epidemic. In Asia approximately 87% of kids aged 16 years and older are near-sighted. That's huge. There isn't a disease process in the world that effects so many people. Vision training and the preventive use of stress-reducing lenses must be used with all children, starting at an early age. It isn't a question anymore of, \"If my child needs glasses, there's something wrong with his eyes.\" No. Children need special kinds of glasses because we don't want anything to go wrong with their eyes. We recommend nutritional supplements and good eat-ing habits in order to prevent disease, not just remediate it once you have it. Vision training is used in the same way. However, since you are working with the body's navigational system, the effects can be profound. ATHM: It sounds like there is a spiritu- al tie-in to all of this. Do you feel that is the case? Dr Liberman: Yes. The thought that keeps coming through is that in our own way we are all trying to \"see through the eyes of God.\" Whether we are religious or think of ourselves as spiritual seekers, we are trying to see things more clearly and be more in alignment with the source\u2014whatever the source is for each of us. ATHM: It seems as though you're pointing to the next paradigm of how we view the body. For a while we saw the body exclusively as a biologic machine. More recently, we've been looking through the mind-body lens. Now you're pointing to seeing the body as part of the sacred domain. Dr Liberman: For many years scientists and clinicians working in the eld of mind-body medicine have spoken about the effect of the mind on the body. It's the foundation of the eld of psy-choneuroimmunoendocrinology. I can understand how the mind can effect the body if you identify yourself as the thinker of the thoughts you are experiencing. However, what happens if you do not identify yourself as the thinker but merely the observer of those thoughts as they enter your eld of awareness? From my experience, the only reason we are aware that thinking is occur-ring is because we are observing that process. We are not the thinker; we are that which is aware of the thinking. The signi -cance of this is the realization that our essence is a eld of aware-ness. We are the seeing mechanism I have been discussing. When we discover this, we truly discover what it means to see.
