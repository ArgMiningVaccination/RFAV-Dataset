Up to 30% of surgical patients experience delayed surgical recovery, marked by prolonged post-surgical pain, opioid consumption, and functional impairment, which contributes $8 billion annually to US health care costs. Novel interventions that improve the resolution of pain, minimize opioid exposure, and accelerate functional recovery after surgery are urgently needed. Multi-modal pre-operative optimization programs (or \"prehab\") integrating exercise, nutrition, and stress reduction have been shown to safely and effectively improve outcomes after surgery. However, no objective biological markers assess prehab effectiveness and are able to tailor prehab programs to individual patients. Surgery is a profound immunological perturbation, during which a complex network of innate and adaptive immune cells is mobilized to organize the recovery process of wound healing, tissue repair, and pain resolution. As such, the in-depth assessment of a patient's immune system before surgery is a promising approach to tailor prehab programs to modifiable biological markers associated with surgical recovery. The primary goal of this clinical trial is to determine the effect of a personalized prehab program on patients immunological status before surgery.
