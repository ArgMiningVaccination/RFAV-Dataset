It reduces the need for memorization by presenting a method of ear acupuncture that is in keeping with the underpinnings of traditional Chinese medicine. The book can be independently studied and easily used to treat various diseases. It covers ear modalities such as needles, press tacks, seeds and incorporates actual cases from clinical practice to illustrate the clinical applicability of specific modalities and ear acupuncture points. A section on ear diagnosis allows you to supplement your assessment of the pulse, tongue, and hara, thus improving your ability to differentiate the functional basis of imbalance and illness. This edition includes five new chapters on the multiple use of auricular points, prescriptionology practice, common ear questions, new research, and ethical issues. It contains detailed tables and photographs that aid understanding and includes an extensive and updated bibliography. The greatest strength of this book is its user friendliness, which allows both the beginning student and the experienced practitioner to successfully apply auricular medicine in the treatment of their patients in a caring, relatively noninvasive, and effective manner.

From Oriental medical theory basics and Western contrasts to clinical perspectives, Chinese Auricular Acupuncture is a solid reference that provides specific techniques, discusses common issues, and includes everything needed to effectively apply acupuncture in this manner. And while one might anticipate the discussions to be medically weighty and scientific, a surprisingly pleasing, easy approach makes this accessible even to beginning students of acupuncture.\" \u2014Donovan's Literary Services, October 2015 \"Of all the current books on this subject in the English language, Dr. Abbate's most closely approximates the type of ear acupuncture that Americans prefer to practice. That makes it a valuable resource for entry-level students and a reassuring guide for seasoned acupuncturists who might wish to renew their skills in this area. It provides answers to questions that are never addressed in more lapidary treatments. ... On the other hand, Dr. Abbate clearly understands that ear acupuncture is ultimately a simple therapy with a wide range of treatment options, many of which are determined entirely by practitioner preference. She avoids the academic complexities found in [other] works, ... preferring a direct, learner-friendly approach. Likewise, she steers clear of the highly prescriptive regimens, ... leaving many of the treatment choices open-ended. Chinese Auricular Acupuncture is perfect for students, and I intend to use it in my classes. It is a great refresher for more experienced practitioners. Overall, this is the most well-written and practical book on ear acupuncture available on the market. I recommend it very highly.
