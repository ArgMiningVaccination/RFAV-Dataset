If you want to try it for yourself, it's important to know the best practices \u2014 and that includes having the right face oil for gua sha massage. \"Gua sha involves using half-moon-shaped stones to massage the face in a specific pattern that boosts circulation and promotes lymphatic Dermatology](https://www.lajollalaserderm.com/), tells Bustle. And while it may seem like a modern fad due to its surge in popularity on social media ( [#guasha](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/guasha) currently has over 770 million views on TikTok, FWIW), it's actually rooted in centuries-old traditions. \"Gua sha is a simulation technique that was [formalized by Chinese medicine](https://www.bustle.com/p/7-weird-but-effective-ways-to-treat-your-acne-according-to-chinese-medicine-74205) and practiced by professionals, passed down as a [therapeutic means within Chinese households](http://en.chinaculture.org/info/2013-04/25/content_456628.htm),\" says [Ada Ooi](https://www.instagram.com/ada.ooi/), celebrity [001 Skincare](https://www.001skincare.com/), adding that [contemporary gua sha tools](https://www.bustle.com/style/new-beauty-products-november-13) have been adapted from those used in ancient Chinese medicine practices and specifically designed to treat the different contours of your face.

However, we may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article. Gua Sha Facial Benefits When you're gliding your gua sha stone against your skin, it works to [help enhance circulation and promote lymphatic flow](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17905355/) board-certified dermatologist [Dr. Joshua M.D.,](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/joshua-zeichner) director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Shirazi echoes this and points to the technique's primary benefits of [reduced inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32185986/) and [facial tension relief](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4339195/#pone.0117146.ref087). Many people also find that doing gua sha helps sculpt their face and define the jawline, adds Shirazi. \"That's typically due to [enhancing lymphatic drainage](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-give-yourself-a-facial-massage-to-stimulate-your-skin-49781),\" she explains, adding that the face \"puffs up\" overnight because [fluid collects in the face](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33089925/) and around the eyes when you lie down. \"After a round of gua sha, your cheekbones look more sculpted as the [excess fluid is flushed into the body's natural detoxification](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-3-facialists-cure-puffy-post-party-skin-3216880) [process],\" she says. Using Face Oil During Gua Sha One of the most important elements of your gua sha treatment is your [facial oil](https://www.bustle.com/articles/201363-9-tips-for-getting-the-most-out-of-your-face-oils). \"When massaging the skin, you want to make sure that you are using a topical treatment that reduces friction,\" says [Dr. Michelle Henry, M.D.](https://www.skinaestheticsurgery.com/), a board-certified dermatologist Celebrity esthetician [Mimi Luzon](https://www.mimi-luzon.com/en/company/a/about/) agrees, clarifying that [using face oil before you massage](https://www.bustle.com/style/face-oil-or-serum-first) allows the gua sha to glide easily, which prevents unintentional pulling or tugging on the skin. \"It's important to have something that provides enough slip so that you can truly move the [tool] along the facial contours,\" says [Shiri Sarfati](https://www.instagram.com/shirisarfati/), a Miami-based beauty expert and licensed esthetician. For the job, oils tend to work better than serums, she explains, adding that serums simply aren't \"slippery\" enough. And if you're naturally oily or acne-prone and hesitant to douse your face in oil, don't fret: Sarfati and Henry assert that [non-comedogenic oils](https://www.bustle.com/articles/80784-7-alternatives-to-coconut-oil-because-your-beloved-coconut-oil-may-clog-your-pores) should be fine for your skin, which include formulas that use [grapeseed oil](https://www.bustle.com/p/5-reasons-to-add-grapeseed-oil-to-your-skin-care-routine-plus-products-to-try-47723), [sunflower oil](https://www.bustle.com/articles/48988-these-sunflower-oil-benefits-for-skin-and-hair-will-have-you-rethinking-your-loyalty-to-olive), [hemp seed oil](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-best-hemp-seed-oil-for-skin-care-12636990), and [sweet How To Properly Use Gua Sha Once you've obtained your topical oil \u2014 and fully cleansed your skin before applying it \u2014 it's [time to massage the skin](https://www.bustle.com/p/this-japanese-facial-massage-will-totally-transform-your-face-in-one-minute-9817919). Zeichner suggests an \"out and down\" application as opposed to upwards movements. \"The goal is to remove excess fluid from the skin,\" he tells Bustle. \"So you want to use the tool in the direction that lymphatic fluid normally flows in.\" And remember: While the intention may be to promote drainage, there is no need to use excessive force on the skin \u2014 gentle pressure will do the trick. \"Heavy strokes can lead to bruising, irritation, and broken capillaries,\" Shirazi warns. Simply glide the gua sha in feather-light strokes and work towards the sides of the face, and you're good to go. Shop Face Oils For Gua Sha For A Luminous Finish Shirazi suggests Mario Badescu's Rose Hips Nourishing Oil, which leaves skin hydrated and nourished without a greasy after-effect. What's more, [rosehip oil is has a multitude of benefits](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-rosehip-oils-for-your-face-18567576), ranging from brightening your complexion to fading hyperpigmentation.

For A Brightening Boost Henry suggests Byroe's Pear Serum Oil for facial massage, pointing to its powerhouse roster of ingredients like [vitamin C](https://www.bustle.com/style/what-does-vitamin-c-do-for-skin-benefits-dermatologists) and [red algae](https://www.thezoereport.com/p/9-algae-skin-benefits-you-need-to-know-about-17126596) \u2014 the latter of which protects skin while drawing in moisture. \"It's packed full of antioxidants which are very useful in building [an] environmental shield and reducing the chance of collagen degradation,\" she tells Bustle.
