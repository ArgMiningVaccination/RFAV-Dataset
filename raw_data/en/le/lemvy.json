Classical Chinese herbal formulations supplement the body's own restorative processes. Herbs are prescribed as decoctions, pills, powders, or topical treatments and are safe when taken in conjunction with western medications. Chinese herbal medicine is one of the most widely used forms of medicine in the world. Your practitioner may prescribe you Chinese herbs, which are different from western herbs. They're almost always prescribed as a formula containing approximately 5 - 15 herbs. By combining different types of herbs in different quantities, we can craft a formula that will address your specific symptoms. Chinese herbs include over 6,000 individual substances \u2014 a typical practitioner uses between 300 and 400 of these substances on a routine basis. Previously, these herbs were only available in dried form and needed to be boiled for several hours to release their active ingredients. Modern advances have lead to natural methods for extracting the active ingredients, so herbs can be prescribed in more palatable forms like pills, tinctures, and freeze-dried granules. These are prepared using good manufacturing practices and are subject to high levels of quality control.
