Herbal Laxitive Tea Salt Water Flush Orange Juice MASTER CLEANSE RECIPE: Lemonade: 2 oz FRESH squeezed organic lemon juice 2 oz GRADE B Organic Maple syrup (also known as Grade A, dark with Robust Taste) 1/10 tsp organic cayenne pepper 8-10oz pure, filtered water Herbal Laxative Tea: There are many available on the market.

Add celery and carrots for about 4 minutes until they all start to get some color on them. Add the greens. Add the spices. Add water to the top of the pot (I used 4 quart pot). Simmer on low for 4 hours. Uncover, turn up heat. Boil out some of the water to reduce. Put in potatoes for 10 minutes. Add beans. Serve immediately. MASTER CLEANSE TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR BODY, MIND and SPIRIT If you're looking for a challenge, or wanting to strengthen your integrity by holding yourself to a commitment, this is an incredible place to start. Not eating for 10 days is a challenge to anyone living in our culture of over-indulgence and food at every corner. We have made ourselves sick by consuming addictive, processed foods that keep us half asleep in our own lives. Committing to the master cleanse is not just about not eating for 10+ days, it's about committing to being ALIVE and AWAKE. It's a commitment to jump start and restart your physical and emotional health!
