Explore API API Reference View Balance requests, responses, and example codeView Balance API Quickstart Learn about Plaid's key concepts and run starter codeGet started Overview Balance is Plaid's product for receiving real-time Balance information via [. This real-time Balance data can be helpful when checking to see if an account has sufficient funds before using it as a funding source for a money transfer. Balance is available for use exclusively in combination with other Plaid products, such as /accounts/balance/get](/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget) [Auth](/docs/auth/)for money movement or account funding use cases, or [Transactions](/docs/transactions/)for personal financial management use cases. Many Plaid products other than Balance provide balance information as part of the accounts object. However, this data is typically updated about once a day, and cached data is often returned, which is not suitable for situations where you need real-time balance information. For retrieving real-time balance, only [ should be used. The exception is immediately after an Item has been linked, when the balance information is guaranteed to be recent. Note that because Balance always retrieves fresh data from the institution, latency may be higher when calling /accounts/balance/get](/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget) [than when calling other Plaid endpoints.](/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget) /accounts/balance/get If you want to evaluate the risk of an ACH return and need lower latency than [, try /accounts/balance/get](/docs/api/products/balance/#accountsbalanceget) [Signal](/docs/signal/). Signal uses machine learning instead of real-time balance checks to evaluate the risk of an ACH return, and can return results in approximately one-tenth the time as the Balance endpoint. Current and available balance Balance typically returns both current and available balance information. For fraud detection and insufficient funds (NSF) prevention use cases, available balance should be used, as it represents predicted balance net of any pending transactions, while current balance does not take pending transactions into account. Available balance indicates balance that is available to spend, which is not the same as the overall value of the account. For example, for credit accounts, it indicates the amount that can be spent without hitting the credit limit (net of any pending transactions), while in investment accounts, it indicates the total available cash. In some cases, a financial institution may not return available balance information. If that happens, you can calculate available balance by starting with the current balance, then using the [Transactions](/docs/transactions/) product to detect any pending transactions and adjusting the balance accordingly. Sample app code For a real-life example of an app that incorporates Balance, see the Node-based [Plaid Pattern Account Funding](https://github.com/plaid/pattern-account-funding) sample app. Pattern Account Funding is a sample account funding app that fetches Balance data to check for sufficient funds before a funds transfer. The Balance code can be found in [items.js](https://github.com/plaid/pattern-account-funding/blob/master/server/routes/items.js#L211-L234). For a tutorial walkthrough of creating a similar app, see [Account funding tutorial](https://github.com/plaid/account-funding-tutorial). Next steps To get started building with Balance, see [Add Balance to your App](/docs/balance/add-to-app/). If you are using Balance as part of an account funding use case, see the [Plaid Account Funding Guide](https://plaid.com/documents/plaid-account-funding-guide.pdf) for an overview of all required steps.
