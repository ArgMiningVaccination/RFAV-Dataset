All of these require that you have the correct information at your fingertips. You will have a comprehensive list of strategies, processes, and action plans to provide your clients with balanced nutrition and lifestyle plans. In this certification, we will also focus on the effects of one's environment and emotions on health. Due to these epigenetic effects, many factors outside of nutrition are crucial to consider within the context of coaching and life. You will learn how to create root-cause solutions. As a Health Coach, it's imperative to experience what you are teaching. This process is like no other! You will be guided through all the cleanses to elevate your mind, emotions, and states of being as you continue to learn and expand on the wisdom shared in these programs. This whole process will enable you to teach/guide others through these protocols because you have experienced them every step of the way. Currently, the health coaching industry is estimated at $13.2 billion / year, with a growth rate of over 16% / year. Knowledgeable, compassionate, and passionate coaches who know how to work on the Root Causes of Disease are virtually non-existent.
