Anointing with essential oil was commonly practiced throughout the Scriptures for many different purposes. The New Testament mentions it specifically in connection with praying for the sick. Today's Aromatherapy is practiced in many different settings and variations but a common denominator among all aroma therapists is the sense of reverence towards the miracle of nature in the form of essential oils. They know that fragrance can affect the mood, calm, relax and release emotions. Today's energy work also comes in a variety of methods, but what all of them have in common is the unconditional love and the spiritual meaning of healing. "}
