According to four gay men who underwent treatment, the group Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH) is \"unconscionable and a sham,\" based on bogus science, and only increased their suffering through expensive, out-of-touch rituals. \"The defendants peddled anti-gay pseudo-science, defaming gay people as loathsome and deranged,\" said a lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is representing the plaintiffs.
