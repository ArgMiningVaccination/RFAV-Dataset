The State of NH is following a phased approach to administer the COVID-19 vaccines based on medical priority. Please go to [vaccines.nh.gov](https://www.vaccines.nh.gov/)to complete a Vaccine Phase Check to see when you would be eligible to receive the vaccine. - Where can I get the vaccine? Governor Sununu stated in his Press Conference on January 14, 2021, that the fastest way for the State to administer vaccines is through the 13 State sites and local hospitals. You will be able to select a location to receive the vaccine when you register through the State's website. If you do not have internet access, you will be able to register over the phone. More details still to follow. - What if I live in another state or winter in Florida? The State of NH has assured us that they will notify us of how our patients in other states (i.e., ME, MA and FL) should get the vaccine. As soon as we know, we will update this page and our Facebook page. - How does the vaccine work? The vaccines use a new technology call messenger RNA (mRNA). Once given the injection, the vaccine waits until the virus enters the body. The mRNA attaches to the virus removing it before you can get sick from it. - Is there any live virus in these vaccines? mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19. - Is the vaccine safe? The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is a top priority. The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. In addition, the CDC has developed a new tool, [v-safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html), as an additional layer of safety monitoring to increase our ability to rapidly detect any safety issues with COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. - Was the vaccine tested on enough people to make it safe? The two vaccines have been tested on tens of thousands of individuals. As many as any other vaccine, even though it has been a shorter period-of-time due to federal funding. - Can my children get the vaccine? The Pfizer vaccine is indicated for 16 years and older and the Moderna vaccine for those 18 years and older. More studies to come. - Can I get the vaccine if I am pregnant? At this time, there have not been enough pregnant women in the clinical trials for there to be a definitive recommendation. However, the indications point to it being safer for a pregnant woman to get the vaccine than COVID-19. - If I had Covid should I still get the vaccine? If you are fully recovered from COVID-19, the answer is yes. This vaccine has been shown to be more effective than your body's own immune system to prevent a future COVID-19 infection. - Will this be a mandatory vaccine? This is not a mandatory vaccine at this time. It is, however, highly recommended. The COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19. Two doses are needed. - Can I pick which vaccine I get? The vaccine you receive will be given out based on availability at the time you are eligible. - What type of side effects could I have? Studies patients showed that mild to moderate reactions have occurred such as injection site irritation, fatigue, fever and body ache - When can I expect side effects? It has been shown minimal side effects occur but if you do get them it is more likely to get when you get the second vaccine. - If I get a side effect how long will I expect it to last? Only a few days. - Is the vaccine 1 or 2 injections? They are both 2 injections: Pfizer is 21 days apart and Moderna is 28 days apart. - Will I get any immunity after the first injection? Studies have shown you will get 50% immunity after the first injection and almost 100% after the second. - Will I have to still wear a mask once I am vaccinated? It is recommended at this time as we roll out the vaccine. - How long does the vaccine last? This is unknown at this time. - If I have other medical conditions is it safe for me to get? The vaccines were studied in patients with cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis to name a few. - Is there a big difference between the vaccines? - Both are similar in that they use the mRNA technology - Pfizer has to be stored and -94 and Moderna at -4 degrees - Pfizer reported a few more side effects from the vaccine, but still minimal, and Moderna has almost no side effects - Both require 2 injections - Pfizer 21 days apart and Moderna 28 days apart - Both are safe and effective "}
