If you're planning to embark on a Cleanse while on your period, rest assured that it's perfectly safe and can even provide support for your menstrual and hormonal health. How Does the Cleanse Affect Your Cycle? Participating in a Cleanse can influence various aspects of your body, including your menstrual cycle. While everyone's experience may differ, it's common for some to notice changes in their flow or the timing of their period during the cleanse. Don't be alarmed if your flow becomes lighter or heavier, shorter or longer - it's all part of the cleansing process. Additionally, if you've been struggling with irregular periods, you may find the cleanse helps to restore regularity. Managing PMS Symptoms During the Cleanse Up to 80% of people who have periods experience mild to moderate premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which can include symptoms like breast tenderness, mood swings, and cramping. The good news is that the Cleanse and elimination diet can potentially alleviate these symptoms. By avoiding certain trigger foods such as dairy and coffee, you may experience reduced PMS discomfort. Moreover, the removal of sugar, coffee, and dairy from your diet during the cleanse might uncover emotions that were previously suppressed, leading to a temporary increase in moodiness. Remember, these adjustments are typically associated with the cleansing process rather than menstruation itself. We recommend journaling during your Cleanse and in the reintroduction phase to help better identify and address these sensations. Providing Extra Support Self-care is crucial, especially during your period. Our Cleanse Programs include dietary recommendations that naturally support your body during this time. Incorporating healthy fats, like avocado, into your meals can help balance your mood and energy levels while keeping you satiated. For added support, [our magnesium powder, Eliminate](https://www.cleanprogram.com/products/eliminate), can alleviate muscle cramps, soothe emotions, and work to relieve period-related headaches. If you're finding you need emotional support or other tips, [consider scheduling a Free consultation with one of our Wellness Coaches](https://www.cleanprogram.com/pages/talk-to-a-coach) before, during, or after your Cleanse, as needed. Choosing the Ideal Time to Begin Your Cleanse If you experience severe PMS symptoms, you may prefer to avoid starting the cleanse during the week leading up to your period. During the first week of Cleansing, your body adjusts to eliminating dietary triggers and sensitivities, which may coincide with detox symptoms. By the second week, you'll likely experience increased energy and improved sleep quality. However, there's no strict rule about when to start your cleanse - listen to your body and honor your self by choosing a time that feels right for you. Balancing Activity and Rest Engaging in gentle physical activities is generally encouraged during the Cleanse, including while on your period. Taking long walks, practicing yoga, or attending pilates classes can provide relief from cramping. If those activities don't resonate with you, a warm bath can offer soothing comfort. Remember to adjust your caloric intake if you increase your physical activity to ensure your body receives sufficient fuel. During a Cleanse, your body is working hard - during menstruation, it's doing double so listening to its cues is essential. Embrace your period and your Cleanse journey with confidence and trust in the transformative power it holds. By exploring our comprehensive program and implementing self-care practices, you can find relief from menstrual symptoms while promoting your overall well-being. Start your transformative journey today and unlock the harmonious relationship between Cleansing, the body, and the mind. "}
