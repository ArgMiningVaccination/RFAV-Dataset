Truth is, that both are great for different purposes. If you can be more specific with your question, that will help. What condition are your wishing to treat, what problem do you wish to solve. In terms of comparing the two, in many ways they are both approaching the same conditions, but from different points of view. What has always struck me about the advantages of Chinese Medicine is its holistic blending of body, mind and spirt. Some chiropractors will also do this, but their foundation is based in Western mechanical structures! Whereas Acupuncture is based on the Chinese view of the energetic anatomy. There is so much more I could say about this. But suffice to say, both approaches have their advantages. If there's something specific you are wishing to address, please let me know. I'd be happy to dial it in more specifically. "}
