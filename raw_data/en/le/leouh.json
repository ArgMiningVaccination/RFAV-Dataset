CDC seeks to accomplish its mission by working with partners th roughout the nation and the world to monitor health, detect and investigate health problems, conduct research to enhance prevention, develop and advocate sound pub lic health policies, implement prevention strategies, promote healthy behaviors, foster safe and healthful environments, provide leadership and training. Those functions are the backbone of CD C's mission. Each of CDC's component organizations undertakes these activities in conducting its specific programs. The steps needed to accomplish this mission are also based on scientific ex cellence, requiring well- trained public health practitioners and leader s dedicated to high standards of quality and ethical practice. Within CDC are five Coordinating Centers, th e National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and Office of the Director The National Institute for Occupatio nal Safety and Health (NIOSH) ensures safety and health for all people in the wor kplace through research and prevention. Of the Coordinating Centers, the one most closely related to APIC's work is the Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID) . Within CCID, the National Center for Preparedness, Detection, and Co ntrol of Infectious Diseases (NCPDCID) protects populations domesti cally and internationally thr ough leadership, partnerships, epidemiologic and laboratory studies, and the use of quality systems, standards, and practices. NCPDCID collaborates with the Coor dinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), CDC, and the agency's national and gl obal partners to c onduct, coordinate, and support infectious disease surveillance, resear ch, and prevention. Each of the center's six divisions complements this cr oss-cutting mission, working with internal and external partners to improve public health. APIC works most closely with the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP), to protect patients, prot ect healthcare personnel, and promote safety, quality, and value in the healthcare delivery system by providing national leadership for nine key areas. Healthcare outcomes, Outbreaks in healthcare settings, 9/26/08 Page 3 Emerging antimicrobial-resistant infections, Efficacy of new interventions for patient safety, Clinical microbiology laboratory quality, Water quality in healthcare settings, Cost effectiveness of prevention interventions, Promotion of implementation and evaluation of prevention interventions, and Development of infection control guidelines and policies. DHQP is organized into three main com ponents: the Epidemiology and Laboratory Branch, the Prevention and Evaluation Bran ch, and the Healthcare Outcomes Branch. The Epidemiology and Laboratory Branch (ELB) provides epidemiologic and laboratory assistance when investigating ou tbreaks of disease a nd other adverse events that occur in healthcare settings. ELB is a reference labora tory for U.S. hospitals and other healthcare facilities for the identification of staphylococ ci and their toxins, anaerobic bacteria, and enteric bacteria. ELB confirms and char acterizes unusual anti microbial resistance patterns and delineates the m echanism of resistance. ELB's environmental microbiology team is developing op timum methods to detect and dec ontaminate healthcare surfaces and water that may be contaminated with Category A and B bacterial agents in a bioterrorism event. The epidemiology secti on responds to outbreaks of new or emerging infectious diseases and other adverse outcomes associated with the delivery of healthcare. Examples of such responses include the firs t-ever description of rabies transmission associated with organ transplantation, inve stigation of nationwide outbreaks associated with contaminated medications and devices, investigation of a nationwide epidemic of Clostridium difficile-associated disease, a nd responding to the emergence of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outside healthcare facilities, including increasing rates of MRSA skin and soft tissue disease. The Prevention and Evaluation Branch (PEB) develops and promotes the implementation of evidence-based guidelines, recommendations, and other interventions to prevent healthcare-associated infections and antimicr obial resistance, relate d adverse events, and medical errors; evaluates the effectivene ss of novel and proven interventions for prevention of healthcare-associated infecti ons and antimicrobial resistance, related adverse events, and medical errors; and deve lops, disseminates, a nd evaluates training and other health communications tools de signed to protect patients and healthcare personnel and to promote quality healthcare. The Healthcare Outcomes Branch (HOB) conducts surveillan ce, research, and demonstration projects to measure the impact of healthcare-associated infections, adverse drug events, and other complications of healthcare. HOB staff work closely with healthcare practitioners and h ealthcare facilities and with partners in other federal agencies, accrediting bodies, and professi onal groups. A major initiative currently underway in HOB is the launch of the Nati onal Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), a web-based system for monitoring healthcare-ass ociated adverse events. More than 300 U. S. hospitals are enrolled; many more are e xpected to participate when NHSN is fully operational. Also under the jurisdiction of CDC is the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). HICPAC is a federal advisory committee made up of 9/26/08 Page 4 14 external infection control experts who provide advice and guida nce to CDC and the Secretary of HHS regarding the practice of h ealth care infection control, strategies for surveillance and prevention and control of health care associ ated infections in United States health care facilities. One of the primary functions of the committee is to issue recommendations for preventing and controlling health care associated infections in the form of guidelines, resolutions and inform al communications. Other functions and activities include information exchange w ith CDC staff and formal and informal interactions with other CDC advisory co mmittees such as the National Center for Infectious Diseases Board of Scientific C ounselors, the Advisory Counsel on Elimination of Tuberculosis and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The committee has liaison representatives fr om professional organizations and other federal agencies - including the Association for Professionals of Infection Control and Epidemiology Inc., the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Association of Peri-Operative Registered Nurses, the Cent er for Medicaid and Medicare Services, the Food and Drug Administration; and such othe r non-voting liaison repr esentatives as the Secretary deems necessary to effectively ca rry out the functions of the Committee. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ( www.cms.hhs.gov ) CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare , Medicaid , SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improveme nt Amendments), and several other health-related programs. Medicare is a federal government-f unded health insurance program for: people age 65 or older, people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and people of all ages with End-Stage Re nal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant). Medicaid is a state administered health car e coverage program for certain low-income individuals and families. Each state sets its own guidelines regarding eligibility and services. CMS develops Conditions of Participation (CoPs) and Conditions for Coverage (CfCs) that health care organizations must meet in order to begin and continue participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These minimum health and safety standards are the foundation for improving quality and protecti ng the health and safety of beneficiaries. CMS also ensures that the standards of accrediting organizations recognized by CMS (through a process called \"deeming\") meet or exceed the Medicare stan dards set forth in the CoPs / CfCs. National Institutes of Health (NIH) ( www.nih.gov ) The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a pa rt of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal ag ency for conducting and supporting medical research. Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve 9/26/08 Page 5 people's health and save lives, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NI H provides leadership and financ ial support to researchers in every state and thr oughout the world. One of the NIH institutes, The National Institute of A llergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducts and supports research to st udy the causes of a llergic, immunologic, and infectious diseases, a nd to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing, and treating these illnesses. Its many major areas of investigation include HIV/AIDS, Biodefense, Emerging and Re-emerging Infec tious Diseases, Vaccine Development, and Antimicrobial Resistance. The National Library of Medicine (NLM), the world's largest research library of the health sciences, serves scientists, health professionals, and the public. The Library has a statutory mandate from Congr ess to apply its res ources broadly to the advancement of medical and h ealth-related sciences. It co llects, organizes, and makes available biomedical information to investigat ors, educators, practitioners, and the public and carries out programs designed to strength en existing and develop new medical library services in the United States. It conducts research in health communications, supports medical informatics, and provides information services and sophisticated tools in the areas of molecular biology and toxicology/environmental health. The Library creates Web-based services for the general public co ntaining information from the NIH and other reliable sources. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ( www.fda.gov ) The FDA is responsible for protecting the publ ic health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and ve terinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines and foods more effective, safer, and more affordable; and helping the public get the accurate, science-based information th ey need to use medicines and foods to improve their health. Health Resources and Services Ad ministration (HRSA) (www.hrsa.gov) The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for improving access to health care services for people who are uninsured, isolated or medically vulnerable. Comprising si x bureaus and 12 offices, HRSA provides leadership and financial support to heal th care providers in every state a nd U.S. territory. HRSA grantees provide health care to uninsured people, people living with HIV/AIDS, and pregnant women, mothers and children. They train hea lth professionals and improve systems of care in rural communities. HRSA oversees organ, tissue and blood cell (bone marrow and cord blood) donation and vaccine injury compensation programs, and maintains 9/26/08 Page 6 databases that protect against health care ma lpractice and health ca re waste, fraud and abuse. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (www.ahrq.gov) AHRQ is the lead Federal agency on quali ty research. AHRQ, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is charged with supporting research designed to improve the quality of health care, re duce its cost, and broaden access to essential services. AHRQ's broad programs of research bring practical, science-based information to medical practitioners and to consum ers and other health care purchasers. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEA LTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) (www.osha.gov ) OSHA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its role is to promote the safety and health of America's workforce, incl uding healthcare workers, by setting and enforcing standards; providing training, outreach and educa tion; establishing partnerships; and encouraging continual process improvement in workplace safety and health. U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEC TION AGENCY (EPA) (www.epa.gov) The mission of the Environmental Protection Ag ency is to protect human health and the environment, working for a cleaner, healthie r environment for the American people. EPA, an independent government agency, work s to develop and enforce regulations that implement environmental laws enacted by Congress. EPA is responsible for researching and setting national standards for a variety of environmental programs, and delegates to states and tribes the responsibility for issu ing permits and for monitoring and enforcing compliance. Where national standards are not met, EPA can issue sanctions and take other steps to assist the states and tribes in reaching the desired levels of environmental quality. NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES THE JOINT COMMISSION (Formerly the Joi nt Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations [JCAHO]) ( www.jointcommission.org ) The Joint Commission evaluates and accredits more than 15,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. An independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission is the nation's predominant st andards-setting and accrediting body in health care. Since 1951, it ha s maintained state-of-the-art standards that focus on improving the quality and safety of care provided by health care organizations. The Joint Commission's comprehensive process evaluates an organization's compliance with these standard s and other accreditat ion or certification requirements. Joint Commission accreditation an d certification is recognized nationwide 9/26/08 Page 7 9/26/08 Page 8 as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards. To earn and mainta in The Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval, an organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every th ree years. (Laboratories must be surveyed every two years.) The Joint Commission provides accreditati on services for the following types of organizations: General, psychiatric, children' s and rehabilitation hospitals Critical access hospitals Medical equipment services, hospice serv ices and other home care organizations Nursing homes and other l ong term care facilities Behavioral health care organi zations, addiction services Rehabilitation centers, group practices, office-based surgeries and other ambulatory care providers Independent or freestanding laboratories The Joint Commission also awards Disease Spec ific Care Certification to health plans, disease management service companies, hospita ls and other care delivery settings that provide disease management and chronic care se rvices. It also has a Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program and is develo ping a certification program for transplant centers and health care services. Joint Commission standards address the orga nization's level of performance in key functional areas, such as patient rights, pati ent treatment, and infection control. The standards focus not simply on an organization' s ability to provide safe, high quality care, but on its actual performance as well. Standa rds set forth performance expectations for activities that affect the safety and quality of patient care. If an organization does the right things and does them well, there is a strong likelihood that its patients will experience good outcomes. The Joint Commissi on develops its standards in consultation with health care experts, providers, measur ement experts, purchasers, and consumers. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE (IOM) ( www.iom.edu ) The nation turns to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies for science-based advice on matters of biomedical science, medicine, and health. A nonprofit organization specifically created for this purpose as well as an honorific membership organization, the IOM was chartered in 1970 as a component of the National Academy of Sciences. The Institute provides a vital se rvice by working outside the framework of government to ensure scientifically inform ed analysis and independent guidance. The IOM's mission is to serve as adviser to th e nation to improve health. The Institute provides unbiased, evidence-ba sed, and authoritative inform ation and advice concerning health and science policy to policy-makers, professionals, leaders in every sector of society, and the public at large.
