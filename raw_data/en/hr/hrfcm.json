Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 13Competencies identified include: Develop and Understand Self as Individual: The Program will provide multiple opportunities for youth to engage in various activities, based on their interests, but also through exposure to new experiences that will push them out of their comfort zone, in a safe and structured setting. Examples include Ted Talks and engaging in new experiences (e.g., cooking, coding, etc.). Develop and Understand Self Within Community: Therefore, youth will understand how they fit in within their immediate environment, and how their actions affect others. They will also be able to make sense of, and begin to transform, their social world. Youth shall explore their own and others' experiences with oppression and privilege to understand and change the underlying causes of social and historical processes that perpetuate problems that they face daily. Develop Sense of Agency: Mindfulness techniques and practices shall be incorporated throughout critical programming aspects, along with facilitated programming. For example, morning circles will begin with mindfulness techniques, and ACPD will partner with experts to explicitly teach youth and staff about the most effective practices. See Yourself into the Future: Helping youth develop a sense of optimism, an expansive view of their potential and options for the future, and self- efficacy should be reinforced through as many programs and policies as possible. Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 14Social Connectedness: These skills include self-discipline and decision- making; the ability to work and communicate with others; develop financial literacy; technological access and skills; parenting skills; empathy for others; and the ability to solve problems without domination, retribution, or violence.

Youth will be given opportunities to financially contribute to their families or loved ones which will help foster their sense of pride, empathy, and dignity and help mitigate negative feelings such as guilt and shame, which are common occurrences among those who have experienced incarceration. In partnership with ACPD, the JJDPC will immediately explore the mechanisms and processes needed to create a youth income plan, outlining the process in which youth can earn income during and after their incarceration. While the details of the plan are still in progress, youth shall be given the opportunity to earn no less than $500 per month (this amount is aligned with cutting-edge research, stating that merely $500 per month can support agency and a reduction of stress and anxiety).68 Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 15Health-Wellbeing and Agency: Youth will have access to trauma-informed physical, emotional, and mental health services and healing; substance use services; and nutrition, sports, and recreation services.

Cognitive and Creative Competencies: Knowledge and ability to appreciate and participate in areas of healing- centered, creative expression will be fostered. This includes access to quality education, critical thinking pedagogy, analysis, and problem solving; literacy, academic support, and college preparation; self- expression and empowerment through the arts; ability to examine and address systemic oppression and root causes of inequity; and awareness of power, privilege, prejudice, and social justice. Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 16Social Justice & Civic Engagement: Youth will be offered opportunities to understand and develop skills related to personal values, moral and ethical decision-making, and participation in efforts contributing to the greater good.

To do this Alameda County must partner with directly-impacted youth and youth advocates to design and deliver a fiscally efficient and equitable plan that transitions the County away from a law enforcement response to children and that (1) builds the capacity of community based organizations to serve young people outside the current justice system; (2) results in a significant reduction in the number of young people who are in contact with the justice system; (3) explores a rehabilitative, health- focused, and care-first model of youth justice that is meaningfully different in operations and outcomes from the current system; and (4) prevents the prosecution and incarceration of children in the adult system.58 For discussion 241The Subcommittee recommends that the County review the working group proposal presented by Free Our Kids (FOK) and undertake that or a similar process for planning. This Subcommittee is committed to working with that process to develop subsequent Realignment Plans and to develop the resources identified as needed to serve the population.58 Letter has been drafted Yes Free Our Kids letter Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 45242In addition to a continuum-of-care process, transitional or step-down programming in a secure setting will also plays a critical role in the reentry process. The decision as to when to transfer youth to a less restrictive facility will depend less on benchmarks or milestones achieved by a given young person, and will instead be dependent on where an individual is more likely to receive the services most tailored to their needs.59 Current Practice YesDr. TAY Services document 243ACPD will strive to ensure step-down programs are individualized and involve a number of options that are geographically spaced throughout the County.59Pending conversations with GSA and CAO. 244All step-down, transitional, and post- release housing options should be community-rooted assets that are resourced to connect youth and families in a healthy way, and do not involve private, for-profit entities with limited investment back in the communities they serve.Pending conversations with GSA and CAO. 245Special consideration in programmatic development and solutions should be paid for girls and gender expansive young people. Agencies and community partners already existing in Alameda County and the bay area that practice a credible messenger model and that have been extremely successful in working with girls and gender expansive youth that are more deeply system involved and should be advisors and core partners in building out the Gender responsive model.60We have and will continue to seek community partners to work with young women and gender expansive youth.Yes Youth Handbook Discipline & Behavior Management Impact Justice Review Verification Current as of May 1, 2023 46246ACPD will eliminate the harshest behavioral controls: pepper (OC) spray and, prone restraint.
