National AIDS Control Programme is a fully funded Central Sector Scheme implemented through State/ UT AIDS Control Societies (SACS) in States/Union Territories (UTs) and closely monitored through District AIDS prevention and control unit (DAPCU) in 188 high priority districts. Currently, National AIDS Control programme (NACP)-IV (extension) is under implementation for the period 2017-20. Components: A. Prevention: Targeted Interventions (TI) for High Risk Groups (Female Sex Workers- FSW, Men who have Sex with Men-MSM, Injecting Drug Users-IDU, Transgenders Hijra- TGH) and Bridge population (migrants, truckers etc) is fundamental to AIDS response and aims to keep these population Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) free through awareness generation, safe behaviour promotion, HIV testing etc. Interventions for HIV prevention are also important for inmates of prisons and other closed settings. People who have Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) have higher risk of HIV infections and hence the NACP provides quality standardized STI/ RTI services at Designated STI/RTI Clinic (DSRC), branded as Suraksha Clinic. Safe blood (free of HIV , Malaria, Syphilis, Hep B and Hep C) is ensured through a NACO supported network of blood transfusion services. B. Information, Education and Communication (IEC): Awareness generation services were rolled out 25 years ago with a focus on awareness generation on the modes of transmission of HIV/ AIDS and the services available for testing and treatment, and continues to be the mainstay of NACP through vibrant multi- media approach comprising Mass media, mid-media and on-ground mobilization & Inter Personal Communications across the country. C. Testing: NACP provides free HIV counselling and testing services (HCTS) for early detection of HIV infections. Free counselling and testing of pregnant women are also provided at these facilities towards prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV . D. Treatment: Treatment services offer free Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) as well as comprehensive management of HIV infected people with respect to treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections. 'Test and Treat' policy has been adopted to enhance the uptake of treatment services by all irrespective of CD4+ counts. Single window delivery of TB and HIV services has also been initiated across all ART centers. Molecular diagnosis/testing (e.g. CBNAAT) is being offered to people living with HIV (PLHIV) identified as presumptive Tuberculosis (TB) cases for early diagnosis of TB.450 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19E. Laboratory Services: Quality of testing under NACP is ensured through laboratory services through State reference laboratory. Besides, there are laboratories to monitor CD4 level among PLHIV in the programme. Moreover, routine viral load (VL) testing for all PLHIV on ART has been outsourced to a private firm. The firm is responsible for sample collection, VL testing and delivery of reports. Early Infant Diagnosis is provided through 6 National Laboratories. F. Mainstreaming & Partnership and Social Protection: Mainstreaming & partnership is one of the key strategies in NACP to strengthen multi-sectoral response to HIV and AIDS. Till date, NACO has signed 17 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) with key Ministries/ Departments of Govt. of India. G. Strategic Information (SI): NACO recognizes rigorous and scientific evidence as central to an effective response and hence, having a strong SI management was a high priority agenda under NACP-IV . The successes of the NACP rest on the bedrock of evidence that India could generate and very effectively use, to make critical policy and programmatic decisions over the last two decades. 24.2 OVERVIEW OF HIV EPIDEMIC IN INDIA As per the recently released, India HIV Estimation 2017 report, national adult (15-49 years) HIV prevalence in India is estimated at 0.22% (0.16% - 0.30%) with 0.25%(0.18-0.34) among males and 0.19% (0.14-0.25) among Females. The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from an estimated peak of 0.38% in 2001-03 through 0.34% in 2007, 0.28% in 2012 and 0.26% in 2015 to 0.22% in 2017. Among the States/UTs, in 2017, Mizoram has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence (1.57-2.56), have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence (0.22%), while Tamil Nadu (0.22%, 0.14-0.31) had a point prevalence like the national average. All other States/UTs have levels of adult HIV prevalence below 0.22%. The total number of PLHIV in India 21.40 lakhs (15.90 lakhs-28.39 lakhs) in lakh while female(15+years) accounts for 8.79 India. Among the States/UTs, in 0.83-1.58). These Eight States together account for almost three fourth (75.00 %) of total estimated PLHIV . Other all states have less than 1 lakh people living with HIV . India is estimated to have around 87.58 (36.45- 172.90) thousand new HIV infection cases in 2017, showing new HIV infection decline by 85% since the peak of 1995 and by 27% between 2010-2017. Women accounted for 40% of annual new HIV infection in 2017. Annual new HIV infections are increasing in three States of the North-East Region - Assam, Mizoram and Meghalaya and also in Uttarakhand, while in Nagaland, Manipur, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Jammu & Kashmir, decline is less than 10% in last 7 years. Ten States account for 71% of total annual new HIV 2005, when the number of AIDS related deaths (ARDs) started to show a declining trend, 451 CHAPTER-24the annual number of AIDS related deaths has declined by almost 71%. In 2017, an estimated 69.11 (29.94 -140.84) thousand people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. AIDS-related deaths have dropped in all of India's States/UT with the exception of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. India is estimated to have had 22.67(10.92-40.60) thousand HIV positive women who gave birth in 2017. State wise Prevention to Mother to child transmission (PMTCT) number were highest in Maharashtra (2.41 thousand) (2.29 thousands), Pradesh, Karnataka, and TamilNadu, least being in Sikkim. Figure 24.2.1: HIV Prevalence (%) among ANC Client, FSW, MSM, IDU & other risk groups, India (HSS 2016-17) 24.3 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS NACO through its NACP aims at halting and reversing HIV epidemic in India. India's HIV epidemic is considered to be concentrated in nature. NACO has targeted its preventive efforts towards sub-groups of population identified to be at high risk of acquiring HIV infection. These High Risk Groups (HRGs) include FSW, MSM, Hijra(H)/ Transgenders (TG), IDU and Bridge Populations such as Migrants and Long Distance Truckers. They are provided with a number of preventive services through around 1,443 NGO/CBO led TIs at present, including; HIV prevention and screening, treatment, care and support services to various HRGs. People from high risk communities are engaged to deliver services and act as catalysts linking them for services and commodities. TI projects provide a package of prevention, support and linkage services to HRGs through drop-in- centre (DIC) and outreach-based service delivery model which includes screening for and treatment of STI, free condom and lubricant, among core groups, Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), creating an enabling environment with community involvement and participation, linkages to integrated counselling and testing centers for HIV testing, linkages with care and support services for HIV positive HRGs, community mobilization, ownership building and specifically for IDUs, free distribution of sterile needles and syringes, abscess prevention and management, Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and linkages with detoxification/ rehabilitation services. The entire programme is built on the peer led approach in partnership with NGOs/CBOs along with SACS and Technical Support Units (TSU). They extend mentoring, handholding and technically supporting the TIs for quality service delivery and enhancing the overall program performance. 24.3.1 Performance of TI Programme Coverage of core HRG group: As far as the coverage of Hijra (H)/ Transgender (TG) population is concerned, NACO has been making consistent efforts to scale up the programme and improve the coverage in high priority States. Based on the recommendations of Mid Term Appraisal, option paper developed for TIs, States were guided to re-structure the TIs keeping in parameters such as positivity, number of years of HRG's association with TI programme, changing dynamics in sex work and injecting practices, etc. These strategies will help to enrol new and young HRGs across typology. TSUs have been directed to provide on-site assistance and handholding to revise the outreach plan so as to cover hard-to- reach and hidden population. 452 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19Coverage of Core HRGs (FSW, MSM, IDU and H/TG) (April to March 2019) 8.68 3.57 1.77 HTGIn Lakhs Estimated Coverage STI Diagnosed & Treated against Clinic Visit): As per NACO guidelines every HRGs should visit STI clinics every quarter, especially for regular medical check-up and for treatment of STI / Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI). The clinic footfall for STI screening was approximately more than 68% among all core groups, however STI/RTI cases diagnosed and treated was high among FSWs as 2.06% while MSM population has recorded more than 1.16 %. Out of total migrant provided STI clinical services, 3.5% are having STI infections; similarly out of total foot fall of truckers 3.7% found STI infections.

The below figure depicts the percentage of HIV tests performed among HRGs through referrals from TI programmes. The positive detection amongst HRGs has been less than 1.12% and the positivity recorded 0.22 % and 0.48 % among migrant and 453 CHAPTER-24trucker respectively. The programme statistics reveals that HRGs who have been associated with TIs for more than five years have been regular to testing and keeping consistent efforts to remain negative across majority of the States. However, positivity has remained a matter of concern among IDUs and HTG population. Testing among the Bridge Population remains a challenge because of their mobility. Positivity among migrants and truckers is the same as in last year (0.2%).

Peer Educators and Outreach workers engaged in TI programme emphasize on consistent and correct usage of condoms in all sexual encounters through one-to-one and one-to-group interpersonal communication. Fig 24.3.4 shows the typology-wise number of condoms (free and social marketing) distributed to the HRGs.454 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19Typology-wise condom pieces distributed to HRGs (April, 2018 to March, 2019) 2077 588 619 HTGIn Lakhs Demand Distribution Source: Monthly Reporting of TI Indicators March 2019 Needle & Syringe distribution patterns among IDUs: As part of the overall Harm Reduction strategy, to prevent HIV amongst IDUs, free clean needles and syringes are distributed to IDUs as per their requirement through NGOs implementing TI programme. Peer educators at the field as well as at the DICs and IDUs are encouraged to return the used syringes and needles, which ensures availability of sterile syringes and needles and reduces the possibility of sharing injecting equipment, thus decreasing risk of HIV transmission and other blood borne diseases. Programme data shows that the distribution of needles and syringes to be consistently high (more than 87%), while the return rate observed is more than 79%.

India has adopted two model of OST service delivery: - NGO Model and Collaborative Model. In collaborative model, the OST services are being delivered at the Government Health Facilities in coordination with the link IDU-TI. There has been massive OST scale up in India from 56 centres in 2007 covering 5,500 IDUs (approx.) to 212 Stand-alone centres and 13 Satellite centres currently covering 29,543 active IDUs (approx.) while the overall IDU ever on OST are more than 70,000. For providing and assuring quality services, a continuous process of capacity building is being followed under OST programme for IDUs. The operational guideline on OST for clinical staff has been revised incorporating new development in the area. A training manual on special needs of Female Injecting Drug Users (FIDU) has been developed which aims to address the issues of FIDU. Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP-Medical) of OST in India (A reference guide for mentors) has been developed. The QAP serves as a resource material for mentors, entrusted with the task of carrying out periodic 'Quality Assurance (QA) visits' to OST centres. With the successful implementation of OST, it is now being recognized as an effective treatment option under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS Amendment Act, 2014). NDPS allows \"management\" of drug dependents.

This facility is also available in Punjab. Community Based Screening (CBS): As per the national guideline all the HCTS facilities have been divided into two types of facilities based on their services provided for individuals i.e. Screening facilities & Confirmatory Facility. Hence to ensure 100% coverage of High-Risk-Group for HIV testing, screening for HIV by TI started CBS in TI and Link Worker Scheme(LWS). At present 1,150 TIs and 63 LWS started implementing CBS from FY 2018-19. States like Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal started implementing 100% CBS. Approximate 3.2 lakh screenings were done through core TIs for existing HRG and 7,726 hard to reach HRGs. Approximate 2.6 Lakhs bridge population was screened through CBS.

Also, there is a concentrated HIV epidemic in India which is focussed only due to its risky behaviour within a limited population. NACP of India and Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP) recognized the importance of HIV/TB co-infection and its control efforts fifteen years back in early 2001. Considering the above, TB screening has been initiated by TIs in July, 2018; total 24,465 core HRGs and bridge population have been screened out of which 42,178 were referred for TB testing, 24,465 were tested for TB and 793 HRGs diagnosed for TB. Total 589 were put on TB treatment out of 793 diagnosed for TB.

The National Consultation was organized by NACO in close collaboration with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, UNAIDS and UNODC. The overall objective of the National consultation Table 24.3.7: Progress of Prison and Swadhar462 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19was to advocate with police training academies to include topics related to drug use and HIV/AIDS into their police training curricula. In his inaugural address, Shri Sanjeeva Kumar, Additional Secretary & Director General (NACO, RNTCP & CGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said that the unifying theme for this initiative is to create awareness about HIV/AIDS among police personnel. He said NACO is taking concerted efforts to engage with other agencies in terms of providing technical support on training and capacity building to enhance access to various HIV prevention and treatment services. He had advised NACO officers to fast-track signing formal MoUs with key Ministries and Departments to move forward on this important initiative. He had reiterated the need to incorporate the experiences of CBOs and NGOs while finalising the topics on drug use and HIV for police training academies. Key achievements (Prisons): \u00be 23 States and 7 UTs have commenced the implementation of HIV/TB intervention in prisons \u00be 85% of the HIV positive inmates have been registered for ART while only 18% of the TB cases have been linked for treatment \u00be Only 7% of the Hep-C cases were linked for treatment \u00be 10% -21% of total prison inmates were identified as drug addicts (% vary across States -Punjab and NE States reported high numbers) \u00be Significant number of STI cases were treated across 7 States (3 UTs & 4 States) \u00be SACS have been requested to liaise with concerned State TB Officer to make TB prevention and treatment services available for prison inmates \u00be It was proposed to establish F-ICTC, ART and OST in all 139 central prisons. As of now, only 145 testing facilities (28 ICTC + 117 FICTC); 16 Link ART centres; and 12 satellite OST centres have been established. 463 CHAPTER-24 Key achievements (Swadhar, Ujjawala & State- run intervention launched by AS & DG, NACO in Assam has paved way for expanding the intervention to women living in other closed settings across other States. CBS, mobile ICTC and health camp approaches are being deployed for carrying out HIV testing facilities amongst women. \u00be 100% ART and TB treatment linkages have been achieved by the team implementing programmes in homes. \u00be Nine States have commenced the implementation of HIV/TB prevention and treatment services in homes and other States are in the process of rolling out the intervention. Based on the guidance of AS & DG (NACO), majority of the Sates where intervention formally inaugurated have signed MoU between SACS, State Prisons department and Dept. of Women and Child Development to ensure effective implementation of proposed HIV/TB intervention. Enhancing Partnerships between Law Enforcement Agencies & Civil Society Organizations in the Context of Drug Use and HIV: The legal and structural barriers continue to pose huge challenges in reaching out to the most vulnerable population with HIV prevention and treatment services. In order to sensitize and forge partnerships between officials enforcing law; NGOs implementing TI interventions and senior officials working with State Health System, a State-level sensitization workshop was organized under the chairmanship of AS & DG, NACO in Guwahati, Assam. There were 7 national-level consultations held and 36 State/district-level sensitization workshops were organized through which more than 1,400 officials were sensitized on various aspects of drug use and HIV; and NDPS Act. These workshops provided a stage for discussion and experience sharing in promoting partnerships between key functionaries of law enforcement Agencies (LEA), TI-NGOs and the State Health Department. 464 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19Other Initiatives under TI With the cooperation of Development Partners, bilateral and multilateral agencies NACO is making concerted efforts to pilot newer initiatives. Following are some of the key highlights: a) Sunrise: The Project supports the NACO's efforts to curb the epidemic through an accelerated response of prevention to care and treatment continuum services among key populations (KP)/HRG, with a focus on PWID/IDU. Project Sunrise has been implementing data-driven and innovative approaches in collaboration with NACO, SACS and TI NGOs to accelerate the HIV/ AIDS response to achieve epidemic control. b) Linkages: 'Linkages across the continuum of HIV Services for KPs Affected by HIV (LINKAGES Project) is to provide Technical Assistance (TA) for promoting the HIV cascade of services. LINKAGES in India is being implemented in six PEPFAR cluster districts in states of Andhra Pradesh (Krishna, Guntur and East Godavari) and Maharashtra (Mumbai, Pune and Thane); and providing support to NACO to strengthen specific areas of services for KP through innovative strategies. c) Cluster Strategy: USAID and CDC in collaboration with NACO jointly developed cluster strategy and implementing various activities to enhance HIV/AIDS Care Prevention and Treatment services at selected districts. (USAID/CDC through FHI360 and other development partners). d) Hridaya: Hridaya is implemented by India HIV/AIDS Alliance, as a part of Alliance Integrated Harm Reduction Programme (AIHRP) of International HIV/AIDS Alliance Brighton. The Project Hridaya has been designed to address the capacity building needs and implementation gaps in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. More than 2700 IDUs and 700 of their female sex partners have been provided with essential harm reduction services during this reporting period. e) Nirantar: Project Nirantar is a civil society capacity building for advocacy and response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic among KPs Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha primarily focusing on building the local capacity initiatives of TI NGOs and SACS. The project has built the capacity of more than 128 TIs through a mentorship programme; enabled KPs to avail social protection schemes; sensitized healthcare providers across facilities at district level; and obtained community feedback by deploying community score card approaches to ensure quality service delivery. f) Multi-country South Asia HIV program for MSM & HTG: The regional HIV programme is to reduce the impact of HIV on MSM and H/TG in South Asia funded by Global Fund to Fights AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) under Round 9. Under the VHS- MSA DIV A Project during the year 2018 - 2019, the project has capacitated more than 250 TI staff on various components of NACO TI operational guidelines on HTG people, sensitised around 100 Government and key stakeholders on issues affecting HTG people, advocated with around 600 people at State and local levels on HIV related issues affecting HTG people. g) Community System Strengthening: NACO is leading a focused initiative on vulnerability reduction and Community System Strengthening (CSS) focussing on CBOs of through SWASTI). During the reporting period (January, 2018 to September, 2018), the project has continued to provide technical support on vulnerability reduction services for 64 COs across 5 States (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra & Karnataka). h) Employer Led Model (ELM): The ELM has been designed to provide HIV/AIDS prevention to care services to informal laboueres including migrants and truckers, who are linked to the industries directly or indirectly. Under this model, efforts are made to involve major industries and associations to integrate comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention to care programme within their existing structure. MoUs are signed by the SACS with the respective employers. SACS/ TSU build the capcity of the employers and support them to conduct different activities for the informal laboureres. Around 527 MoUs are signed with the industries. The achivements for MoU signing is 72%. Out of total MoUs signed, about 444 number of industries have started implementing activities for the informal labourers and around 1.60 lakh informal workers are covered through the outreach activities. District AIDS Prevention and Control Units (DAPCU) In NACP-III, as a major structural reform, the management of HIV prevention and control programme was decentralized to district level. Using the HIV Sentinel Surveillance data (2004- 2006), all the districts in the country were divided into four categories (Category A, B, C and D) based on the disease burden. As per this, there were 156 Category A and 39 Category B districts (total 195 districts) across the country that required priority attention. NACO established DAPCUs in 188 such districts to provide programmatic oversight through decentralized facilitation, monitoring and coordination of HIV/AIDS programme activities in the district. The major responsibility of DAPCU is facilitation, monitoring and coordinating NACP activities at the district and sub- district level by integrating with the health system to the extent possible for better synergy and optimal results. DAPCUs, through active engagement of the district administration engages allied line departments and private sector in mainstreaming the programme and advocates district-specific initiatives even by leveraging local resources. This helps in linking vulnerable 466 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19population with various social entitlements and welfare schemes. DAPCU staff builds the capacity of the facility staff, monitor the referrals and linkages through regular supervisory visits to HIV facilities and monthly review meetings, addresses supply chain management issues through inter and intra-district transfers and make troubleshoot visits, wherever necessary. A team of experts under DAPCU National Resource Team (DNRT), have been able to continuously mentor these district level units, at the same time, have been providing technical assistance at the state and national level to improve the functioning of DAPCUs. To promote wider sharing of knowledge within the districts, different platforms have been created. One of them is identification of successful approaches and models, documenting them as case studies and sharing them widely with all the DAPCU staff in the form of \"DAPCU Series\". This practice has encouraged many DAPCUs to document and present their achievements to SACS and NACO through DAPCU series. While it is difficult to include all the experiences through this mode, the need for a larger space was felt. \"DAPCU SPEAK\" (http://dapcuspeak.blogspot. in/), is another initiative that emerged from this experience. This helps in peer learning and gradual building of knowledge in the field staff, if used properly. Link Worker Scheme (LWS) - Reaching-out to Rural Populations In fourth phase of NACP, the LWS has been designed to intensify and consolidate the prevention services focusing on risk population in the rural areas with a mandate to work in 128 districts across 16 States of India in the FY 2018-19. Two districts are withdrawn since last year. The LWS aims to address complex needs of rural HIV prevention, care and support through identification and training of village level workforce of Zonal Supervisors, Cluster Link Workers and other stakeholders on issues of HIV/AIDS, gender, sexuality and Sexual Tract Infections.The scheme envisages creation of demand for various HIV/AIDS related services, linking of the target population to existing services (as the scheme itself does not create any service delivery points), creating an enabling and stigma free environment, ensuring the target population continue to access information, services in a sustained manner, creating linkages with services of other departments through ASHA volunteers, anganwadi workers, panchayat heads etc. The scheme involves highly motivated and trained community members - 20 Cluster Link Workers in each district for clusters of villages (usually 5 villages each) - responsible for establishing linkages between the community on one hand and information, commodities and services on the other. These Cluster Link Workers are supervised by 2 Zonal Supervisors in each district. The specific objective of the scheme includes: Reach out to HRGs and vulnerable men and women in rural areas with information, knowledge, skills on STI/HIV prevention and risk reduction. This entails: (a). Increasing the availability and use of condoms among HRGs and other vulnerable men and women. (b). Establishing referral and follow-up linkages for various services including treatment for STIs, testing and treatment for TB, ICTC/PPTCT services, HIV care and support services including ART, (c). Creating an enabling environment for PLHA and their families, reducing stigma and discrimination against them through interactions with existing community structures/ groups, e.g. Village Health Committees (VHC), 467 CHAPTER-24Self Help Groups (SHG) and Panchayat Raj in FY 2018-19 In FY 2018-19, LWS was proposed to be implemented in 128 districts across 16 States. As on March, 2019, LWS was implemented in 121 districts. Under the scheme, over 50,311 FSW, 4,121 IDUs, 5,100 MSMs and 226 TGs were reached in rural areas nationally. In addition to this, the scheme also covered nearly 5.0 lakh migrants, 0.78 lakh truckers and 6.4 lakh other vulnerable populations. The programme also reached out to 21,637 PLHIV; 1.4 Lakh ANC and around 12,559 TB cases. Around 8.8 Lakh population were tested for HIV; and 41,907 cases have sought treatment for STI. The above services were provided by establishing linkages with existing services. 60,04,025 free condoms and approximately 6,75,112 socially marketed condoms were distributed during the period. Condom Promotion Programme Condom promotion by the MoHFW, Government of India (GoI) has a long history. In the initial period, condom was promoted under National Family Planning Program. With the emergence of HIV as a serious health threat, promotion of condom for preventing HIV/AIDS was taken under the NACP. With the knowledge that maximum percent of HIV infection is transmitted through unsafe sex, significant efforts have been made by NACO to increase the awareness and usage of condoms to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS. NACP has consistently focussed on prevention from HIV/AIDS through safe sex practices. Given the significant role of condoms in the prevention of STI/HIV infections, the NACO promotes condom use for controlling the epidemic. In view of the prevailing status regarding condom usage in the country, a well-focussed national level condom programme has been implemented that includes distribution of free condoms among the most vulnerable ones. The desired behavioural outcomes of the condom programme are to increase consistent use of condoms among men with the non-regular sexual partners or in commercial sex encounters and among married couples for preventing unwanted pregnancies. Condom Demand Generation NACO continued to follow its communication framework devised under the current strategy adopted for long term that is based on promoting condom use by enhancing self-risk perceptions. The primary objective is to motivate the behaviour change among the key target population like HRGs, bridge population as well as general population especially the youth as a category. Under this strategy, all condom promotion communication activities were developed to focus on bringing positive behaviour change towards consistent condom use. These promotions are designed to promote condoms for its benefits of triple protection from the risks of HIV/AIDS, STI and unwanted pregnancy. NACO promotes safe sex and regular condom use through its campaigns on mass media. These condom promotion campaigns on mass media are aired on national networks of Door- darshan, leading Cable & Satellite Channels, All India Radio and private FM channels to ensure countrywide footprints. This year, a new mass media campaign was developed in Hindi and other regional languages. The new campaign is based on theme of 'making regular condom use a habit' to ensure its consistent 468 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19use. The basic premise of this communication is to encourage audience to adopt safe sex practice by using condom every time. This campaign has been developed in two parts depicting various common incidents and events occurring in daily life of a lay man. The essence of each of these episodes is to highlight benefits of good habits and thus appealing for making condom use a habit in order to play safe while having sex. This campaign was conceived to be an integrated one encompassing compatibility across various media platforms including television, radio, outdoor, social media sites on the internet, mid-media activities, leaflets and merchandise as promotion material for display at the points of purchase. Digital cinema screening was also included in condom campaign; media plan to reach out to the target population through cinema halls of smaller towns. Only those cinema halls located in priority districts are shortlisted. Free Supply of Condoms Condom programme implemented by NACO focuses on optimizing the supply of free condoms to ensure availability to the vulnerable population and minimize the wastage of free condom. The institutional mechanism has been established to regularly track, free condom supply received from Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to SACS to avoid stock out situation at SACS; to analyse free condom from SACS to TI-NGOs and subsequent distribution from various TI-NGOs to Most at Risk Populations (MARPs); and estimate free condom demand at TI-NGO and SACS levels based on previous data analysis. The annual condom demand is estimated at SACS based on HRGs coverage, past condom usage trends and reviews of existing inventory of free condoms at SACS as well as at TI-NGOs covered by SACS. NACO in close collaboration with respective SACS ensures availabilities of free condoms under National Health Mission (NHM) and stocks are transferred from NHM to SACS wherever feasible. Based on the budget available with NACO, below is the State wise supply of free condoms in FY 2018-19:Table 24.3.8: Free Condom Estimation under NACO for 2018-19 States Estimated Annual Demand of Free 327,864,732 294,785,568 24.4 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STI) AND REPRODUCTIVE TRACT INFECTION (RTI) CONTROL & PREVENTION PROGRAM The prevention and control of STIs is a well- recognised, cost effective strategy for controlling HIV transmission and reducing reproductive morbidity. Early diagnosis; appropriate and complete treatment of STI/RTI reduces the transmission rate of HIV infection by more than 40%. Syndromic Case Management (SCM), with minimal laboratory tests is the cornerstone of STI/ RTI management under NACP. The key strategies for STI prevention and control are to (a) interrupt transmission where it spreads fastest, and (b) provide services for all who may need them. Currently, there are 1,165 NACO supported DSRC across the country (at least one DSRC per district). There are two arms of DSRC are a) Obstetrics & Gynaecology OPD and b) STI OPD under dermato- venereology clinics and provide services through existing public health care delivery system. The details of number of individual availed STI service and diagnosed STI and pregnant women tested for Syphilis and diagnosed syphilis during FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19 (from January, 2018 till March, 2019 along with North -East data), are provided in the following table. Table 24.4.1: STI/RTI Testing and sero-prevalence FY ServiceNo of ReactiveNo. of Individual referred to ICTC for HIV testNo. of Individual Found HIV positiveTotal ANC registration reported in STI/RTI centreNo. of PW tested for SyphilisNo. of PW found till Mar, 2019) The sero prevalence of Syphilis is observed to be declining steadily among patients with STI/RTI, pregnant women and HRGs. NACO target is to manage 94.8 lakh episodes of STI/RTI in 2018-19, out of which the program has achieved 88.35 lakh (93%) till March, 2019. Pre-packed STI/RTI colour-coded Kits The colour coded STI/RTI kits have been provided for free supply at all DSRCs and TI NGOs to standardize the treatment. The pre-packaging of the drugs is being recognized as one of the global innovation in STI programme management. The 470 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19drugs used to treat common STI/RTI are included in the National/State List of Essential Drugs. The division also procured Injection Benzathine Penicillin 2.4 million units for all health facilities including NHM facilities. Regional STI/RTI Training, Research and Reference Laboratories There are 10 functional Regional STI Training, Reference and Research Laboratories supported & strengthened by NACO. These are located at : 1) Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad 2) Medical College Kolkata and Institute of Serology, Kolkata 3) Government Medical College, Nagpur 4) Government Medical College, Baroda 5) Institute of Venereology, Chennai 6) Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi 7) BYL Nair Hospital, Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai 8) Government Medical College, Guwahati, Assam 9) Post Graduate Institution of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 10) Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi which acts as the Apex Centre as well as Regional Laboratory for the country. The key functions of these laboratories are to provide etiologic diagnosis of common STI/RTI syndromes, validation of syndromic diagnosis, monitoring of drug sensitivity of gonococci and implementation of Syphilis External Quality Assessment Service (EQAS). NACO and CDC with SHARE India have conducted assessment of all the Regional STI Centre last year, during assessment of Quality management system and programme component.During the period May-August, 2017, Apex Regional center, (Safdarjung Hospital) has conducted STI Surveillance and community based study in HRGs to find out the Susceptibility &Sensitivity Pattern of Gonococci (GASP), first line drug used for the Gonorrhoea. Training and Capacity building and regular onsite mentoring of STI/RTI service providers. Standardized training curriculum for doctors, staff nurse, laboratory technician and counsellor is in place. The training to these staff is provided in a cascade form through a cadre of national, State and regional resource faculties across all States. All faculty members have been trained using the same training material, following adult learning methods. The State and regional resource faculties in turn have conducted training of STI/RTI clinic staff in the designated clinic and TI NGO. Additionally, each district has district resource facilities for training doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians on STI/RTI management for sub district health facilities (PHC, CHC, and Sub -district hospital), and doctors in private sector also. Basics of STI programme activities were included in the curriculum developed for trainings of ANM at FICTC and laboratory technicians of ICTC, wherein the related curriculum has been incorporated into their existing curriculum so as to make service delivery comprehensive. To enable screening of pregnant women accessing labour room directly, a training module was designed to orient labour room nurses for screening of direct walk in pregnant women both for HIV and Syphilis. Convergence with NHM STI/RTI services are also an integral part of services provided at all Government health facilities including PHC/CHC. At each of these health facilities a standardized service delivery protocol is followed. Medical and paramedical staffs are trained, free STI treatment is provided to patients and monthly reports on STI/RTI indicators 471 CHAPTER-24are reported by these facilities through existing HMIS. In addition of earlier indicators, the following indicators of Syphilis have been incorporated in the Health Management Information system (HMIS). 1. Number of PW tested using POC test for Syphilis 2. Out of above, number of PW found sero- positive for syphilis 3. Number of pregnant women tested for Syphilis 4. Number of pregnant women tested found sero-positive for Syphilis 5. Number of syphilis positive pregnant women treated for Syphilis 6. Number of babies diagnosed with Congenital Syphilis 7. Number of babies treated for congenital Syphilis National operational guidelines and training modules for medical officers and para-medical staff for STI/RTI services have been developed jointly by NACO & NHM and disseminated. A joint convergence meeting between NACO and NHM is conducted once every quarter. STI curriculum is integrated in the training module for nurses and an integrated package of STI/HIV training is imparted by Indian Nursing Council for nursing staff as per the standardized curriculum. NACO has revised national STI/RTI technical guidelines, 2014 in consultation with NHM. STI Division and NHM are jointly implementing Elimination of Parent to Child Transmission (EPTCT) of Syphilis and has done joint procurement of Inj. Benzathine Penicillin for NHM. Provision of STI/RTI Services in HRG Population The provision of a standardized package of STI/ RTI services to HRG population is an important component of the TI projects. All the core group population receives packages of services which include: 1. Free consultation and treatment for their symptomatic STI complaints 2. Quarterly medical check-up 3. Asymptomatic treatment (presumptive treatment) 4. Bi-annual syphilis and HIV screening Preferred Private Provider approach has been rolled out to scale up STI/RTI services to HRG population under TI Projects. These providers are selected by the community members through group consultation. This approach has enhanced access to services for the HRG. Under this approach, all the HRG receives free STI/RTI treatment and the providers receive a token fee of Rs.75 per consultation. A total of 3400 preferred providers are providing STI/RTI services to the HRG. All these preferred providers are trained using a standardized curriculum on syndromic case management. Colour coded STI/RTI drug kits have also been made available to these providers for free treatment of sex workers, MSM and IDU, and data collection tools are also provided to them. Partnering with PSU and Professional Organization The major proportion of patients with STI/RTI seek services from the vast network of private health care delivery systems ranging from freelance private practitioners to large public hospitals. Also, many populations are accessing services from public health care systems under other sectors like railways, ESI, Armed Forces, CGHS, Railways, Port hospitals as well as health facilities of public sector undertakings like Coal India Ltd, SAIL etc. It has been felt that reaching out to maximum number of people suffering from STI/RTI is not possible without partnership with private sector and organized public sector. NACO has initiated 472 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19partnership with organized public sector and private sector through professional associations to support the delivery of STI/RTI services with the objective to reach the populations presently not covered by the public health care delivery system. STI/RTI services have been rolled out in major port hospitals, ESIC, private medical colleges. National Strategic Plan 2017-2024 (NSP) The vision of STI/RTI control and prevention program is to provide standardized STI/RTI services and Sexual and Reproductive Health services (SRH) at all levels of health system through convergence with NHM and private sector; especially focusing on women, adolescent and marginalized population. The strategies propose to provide comprehensive STI/RTI services not only to vulnerable populations and HRGs but also to the general population and communities at large. In doing so, NACO will ensure greater convergence and ownership of STI/ RTI management in the general health system and partnership with private sector.24.5 BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICES The annual requirement of blood for the country is estimated at 1.5 crore units of blood and the endeavour is to meet the blood needs of the country through voluntary non-remunerated donation through a well-coordinated and networked blood transfusion service. Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) The BTS comprise of 3,108 licensed blood banks across all states and sectors, of which a network of 1,131 blood banks are supported by NACO in the way of equipment, manpower and consumables. Overall 75.05% of blood was subjected to componentization in NACO supported Blood Component Separation units in 2018-19. NACO has been primarily responsible for ensuring provision of safe blood for the country since 1992. During NACP, the availability of safe blood increased from 44 lakh units in 2007 to 1.22 crore units by 2018-19. During this phase, incidence of donor HIV sero-reactivity has declined from 1.2% to 0.14% in NACO supported blood banks. Table 24.5.1: Blood Donation statistics for Blood Transfusion Services, India Financial 2012-13 2013-14 6.64 6.3 6.6 6.9 V oluntary Blood Donation in NACO supported BB (%)84 84 84 79 77 78 76 HIV (%) 0.2 0.2 0.14 0.14 0.12 0.13 0.14 HBsAg (%) 1.1 1 0.85 0.33 MP (%) 0.1 0.1 0.08 0.07 0.05 0.07 0.05 VDRL (%) 0.2 0.2 0.18 0.15 0.21 0.18 units were collected across the country in NACO supported blood banks. 76.30% of the collection was through voluntary blood donation (VBD). The VBD percentage is comparatively lower than the previous years due to a change in definition of voluntary blood donor, so as to exclude family donors. Key Strategies: Government has adopted a comprehensive approach towards strengthening BTS, key strategies for which include: Increasing regular voluntary non- remunerated blood donation to meet the safe blood requirements of safe blood in the country; Promoting component preparation and availability along with rational use of blood in health care facilities and building capacity of health care providers to achieve this objective; Enhancing blood access through a well networked regionally coordinated BTS; Establishing Quality Management Systems to ensure safe and quality blood and Building implementation structures and referral linkages. National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) The functions of NBTC as the policy formulating apex body in relation to all matters pertaining to operation of blood centers are as follows: Commitment to provide safe and adequate quantity of blood, blood components and blood products through an organized blood transfusion service in the country; Formulate and implement National Blood Policy and implement National Blood Programme in the country; Make latest technology available for operating the BTS and encourage the appropriate use of blood and blood product and encourage the research and development of field transfusion medicine and related technology Take adequate regulatory and legislative steps in blood transfusion process and provide adequate resource policy framework of blood bank services in the country. NBTC and State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) are the apex bodies responsible for BTS at national and state level. Activities of NBTC in 2018-19 include: 1. EQAS through two Proficiency Testing providers @ Rs. 4,000 per blood bank per year for a) 179 blood banks through CMC, Vellore completed b) 189 blood banks through SDMH, Jaipur Completed 2.

Logo and tagline for VBD has been developed (Raktdaan, Karke Dekho, Achcha Lagta Hai). It will be used extensively in all the IEC Material developed and will give a separate entity to VBD. IEC material has also been created which consists of posters, leaflets, standees, corporate docket, short movie and exhibition panels. These IEC Material was developed by taking inputs from central & State officers of BTS, VBDs, SACS Youth and IEC officers along with field experts in transfusion medicine, blood donor counselling, blood donor motivation and recruitment and representatives of NGOs engaged in promotion of VBD. Communication Strategy has also been developed to support the optimal use of IEC materials. 476 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19 24.6 BASIC SERVICE DIVISION (BSD) The BSD of the NACO provides HCTS for HIV infection, the first critical step in detecting and linking people with HIV to access treatment cascade and care. It also provides an important opportunity to reinforce HIV prevention. The national programme is offering these services since 1997 with the goal to identify as many people living with HIV , as early as possible (after acquiring the HIV infection), and linking them appropriately and in a timely manner to prevention, care and treatment services. The introduction of ART services for people living with HIV/AIDS in 2004, gave a major boost to counselling and testing services in India. The HCTS include the following components: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC)/HCTS Prevention of Parent-To-Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) HIV/TB collaborative activities A. Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) There are different types of HCTS facilities in India, which include Standalone ICTC (SA-ICTC), Mobile ICTC, Facility Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (F-ICTCs), Public Private Partnership ICTCs (PPP ICTCs), and CBS for HIV including Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND). The terminology of ICTC becomes HCTS Centre after the release of National HCTS Guideline Dec 2016. In order to offer HIV testing to every pregnant woman in the country, so as to enhance detection of all HIV positive pregnant women and eliminate transmission of HIV from parent to child. There is an increase in the number of ICTCs in the country, clearly portraying integration of counselling and testing services under general health services, increase in geographical coverage of these services below block level, better accessibility and addressing sustainability.477 CHAPTER-24Scale-up of ICTCs (data (provisional) source is Strategic Information Management System (SIMS) as on March, 2019 and the cumulative data since April, 2018 -March, 2019 has been taken) HIV Counselling and Testing Services of General Individuals During the FY 2017-18, around 209.9 lakhs general individuals were tested for HIV out of against the annual target of 180.7 lakhs and out of which 182,397 general individuals were diagnosed HIV positive. While, during Jan, 2018 to March, 2019, around 308 lakhs general individuals have been tested for HIV , out of which 2,21,428 were diagnosed HIV Positive. The below Figure shows year wise general individuals tested for HIV and the positivity.

Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) The PPTCT programme was started in the country in the year 2002. As on 2019 March, 29,977 ICTCs in the country offer PPTCT services. The aim of the PPTCT programme is to offer HIV testing to every pregnant woman (universal coverage) in the country, so as to cover all estimated HIV positive pregnant women and eliminate transmission of HIV from mother-to-child. During the FY 2015- 16, NACO has decided to implement Early Infant Diagnosis(EID) service through all SA-ICTCs (fixed) across the country. Currently this service is available through all (5,412) SA-ICTCs. In the FY 2017-18, against the target of 180.7 lakhs pregnant women, 207.7 lakhs were tested for HIV . Out of which, 9,550(new cases) pregnant women were found HIV positive. There were 4,792* known HIV positive Pregnant women were also reported in FY 2017-18. Out of total (new +known) 14,342 HIV positive pregnant women, 93% (13,276) were registered at ART and 91% (13,027) were initiated lifelong ART. Further HIV exposed live birth reported in 2017-18 is 11,409 out of which, 87% babies were initiated ARV prophylaxis. During the period of January, 2018 to March, 2019, around 274 Lakhs of pregnant women were tested** for HIV , and total 18,240 (11,839 new cases & 6,401 known cases*) HIV positive cases were reported, out of which, 91% (16,604) were initiated lifelong ART*. During Jan, 2018 to Mar, 2019, around 13,768 HIV exposed live birth were reported, out of which 11,870 (86.2%) babies were received ARV prophylaxis. Scale-up of Pregnant Women tested and positivity in ICTCs during the period from 2007-08 to 2018-19 (**data (provisional) source is SIMS as on 22nd Apr., 2019 and the cumulative data since Jan, 2018 to March, 2019 has been taken) *(CST-MPR Report) 2 2.34.66.1 women tested in millionsTested (in Million) % HIV positivity 1. Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) HIV exposed infants born to infected pregnant women have to undergo DNA-PCR tests using Dried Blood Spot (DBS) test (DNA-PCR). During January, 2018 to March, 2019, about 7,491 babies (6 weeks to 6 months) were tested under the EID Programme using DBS DNA PCR, out which 137(1.8%) babies were confirmed HIV positive 479 CHAPTER-24under DBS DNA PCR confirmatory test, and 100 (73%) babies were put on ART. Under this period, 5,216 HIV exposed babies (6 weeks to 6 months) were initiated on CPT. Total no. of HIV exposed babies who underwent 18-month antibody test was 9,234, among these babies 399 (4.3%) were diagnosed/confirmed HIV positive and 356 (89.2%) initiated on Paediatric ART. 2. Quality Improvement Initiatives under Basic Services I. Supervision and Monitoring Mechanism: Supportive Supervisory visit conducted by BSD Official to NACP facilities in Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh from 7th & 10th-12th July, 2018 to review on ground implementation of the NACP services. This visit was aligned with PLHIV-ART Linkage System (PALS) Training programme organized by Chandigarh and Haryana SACS. II. Quality assurance and EQAS: The diagnostic services provided through ICTCs across the country are strictly monitored by a strong Internal and External Quality Assurance Scheme (EQAS). III. Supply Chain Management: A strong monitoring mechanism for inventory management is in place. The inventory status for all commodities at the State, District and Facility level is monitored on monthly basis at the National level. IV . PLHIV-ART Linkage System (PALS): NACO has implemented PALS in India for tracking & monitoring of cascade of services provided to HIV Positive general individuals, pregnant women and their children. PALS allow the tracking services provided by different health facilities at different time points & geo-locations. All States/UTs implemented PALS and are reporting data in it.V. Community Based Screening approach: CBS is an important approach for improving early diagnosis, reaching first-time testers and people who seldom use clinical services, including men and adolescents in high- prevalence settings and HRG populations. To improve HCTS access and coverage, community-based HIV screening is carried out through various approaches such as:- a) Mobile HCTS; b) Screening by ancillary health-care providers (ANC); c) Screening for HIV by TI (TI-ICTC); d) HCTS for prison inmates and e) HCTS at the workplace. Currently the bulk of CBS efforts are through targeting HRGs via TIs and Other Development Partners and CSO. In this regards regional ToT were conducted in different regions to create master pool for conducting the field level training. NACO has completed the TOTs and around 2,015 master trainer are trained from all 36 States/ UTs. Standard Operating Procedures for CBS and training manual \"Testing through TI\" for Community Based HIV testing under National HIV Counselling & Testing Services Guidelines, 2016 has been shared with all the States. As on 2018 December, 1,821 CBS sites were established under different settings as mentioned above and reporting to NACP through SIMS. In current financial year approximately 8 lakh Pregnant Women were screened for HIV through VHND level testing. As per the current SIMS Report, 25 States are implementing CBS. Out of 1,427 TIs, 480 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19786 TIs are reporting in SIMS with 4.1lakh individuals screened since April, 2018, and there are multiple civil society organizations having conducted a cumulative of 100,000+ screenings. VI. Achieving Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (EMTCT):- Every year, globally, an estimated 10.4 lakh women living with HIV become pregnant. Untreated, they have a 15-45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. However, the risk drops to just over 1% if ARV medicines are given to both mothers and children at the stages when chances of transmission can occur. As treatment for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission is not 100% effective, elimination of transmission is defined as a reduction of transmission to such a low level that it no longer constitutes a public health problem. India is signatory for achieving the EMTCT of HIV and Syphilis by 2020. A road-map for achieving EMTCT was prepared and has been steadily rolled- out under the current NACP. Looking at elimination of MTCT goals, NACO has conducted the data verification for EMTCT of HIV & Syphilis in the State of Maharashtra, which have demonstrated successful implementation & achievements of EMTCT in our country, based on certain programme indicators which are outlined in the global guidelines on criteria and process of EMTCT verification. National Workshop on Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV , October, 2018 National Workshop on Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV , October, 2018 To accelerate the activities towards EMTCT data verification exercise in the States, NACO has initiated the process of data verification in the identified EMTCT Phase-2 States of the country (viz. Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Odisha, Jharkhand, MP, on 19 States (phase-1 & phase-2).481 CHAPTER-24VII. Review meetings As part of program, the BSD, NACO has been conducting review meetings on BSD components at regular intervals both at National and State level, which includes, review meeting for SACS (ICTC/PPTCT) and STI components, National TB HIV Joint review meetings, National TB HIV Coordination committee (NTCC) and, National TB HIV Technical Working Group (NTWG) meetings. The main purpose of the meeting is evaluating the performance of the States/UTs under NACP. VIII. Training a) EMTCT Phase 2 State Assessment Leads (Training of Trainers) along with orientation of SACS officials in 19 States/UTs held at Chennai on 26-27 September, 2018. The 2 days training was organized by ICMR- NIE Chennai. This training was planned to train the identified resource persons on the national/state/district/facility level for EMTCT assessment activities. They will subsequently conduct the assessments and train the District Implementation Teams at the state/regional level. The representatives from 19 States/UTs, Development Partners and Officials from NACO attended the training. b) So far the progress made regarding the training of ANM/Staff Nurse and Counsellor by project Saksham-Prerak of TISS is as below: i. ToT of Project Saksham-Prerak Staff was conducted at TISS, Mumbai from 22nd to 24th October, 2018. ii. All (Chandigarh, Units (RTU) and one NACO PC at Delhi are in place. iii. The training of ANM & Staff nurses on HIV & Syphilis screening of pregnant women has started in December, 2018 and so far we have conducted 34 training batches in 11 States & one UT. iv. 605 facilities (411 PHCs, 16 CHCs and 178 other type) covering 968 healthcare service providers (439 ANMs, 270 staff nurses and 259 other similar profiles). v. Of these 563 facilities are newly created FICTCs registered 1st January, 2018 onwards. vi. Agency for developing E-learning platform for virtual training has been selected and in the same breath TISS Saksham-Prerak has requested to support for selection of Consultant to develop eLearning Module Content. vii. Around 30 batches covering approx. 30 participants each are planned in Feb, 2019. c) E-learning module: With the aim to introduce innovation in technology and ease of comfort for counsellors, lab technicians and other healthcare providers in this journey; NACO, in collaboration with UNAIDS has captured the National HCTS guidelines in an engaging, simplistic, and retainable eLearning module in Hindi and English languages, to facilitate smooth scale up, efficient implementation and uptake of HCTS. With these digitized learning modules, we aim to empower our teams, ensure accurate implementation of the guidelines, and realization of our national goals with reference to the global SDG's. AS&DG (NACO), MoHFW, GOI, launched the \"eLearning Module on HIV Counselling and Testing Services Guideline\" on 26th October, 2018 during National EMTCT workshop held on 24th to 26th October, 2018 at Hyatt Regency New Delhi. The eLearning on HCTS guidelines has been 482 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19rolled out with 25 States and UTs through \"WebEx session\" at UNAIDS Office. NACO is organising regular webinars to facilitate counsellors and lab technicians in SACS, DAPCU and ICTC levels to adopt the digitised trainings. More than 800 counsellors joined WebEx session till December, 2018. Around 130 counsellors completed the course from the State Madhya Pradesh and received their certificate. NACO is continuously requesting State/ UTs to motivate their counsellor to access the eLearning platform (http://elearninghcts. org/) and complete certification. Newer Initiatives: 1. Implementation of E-Learning Module on HCTS guideline to digitalize the training of HCTS staff with aim to introduce innovation in technology and ease of comfort for counsellors, lab technicians and other critical partners in this journey, NACO, in collaboration with UNAIDS has captured the National HCTS guidelines in an engaging, simplistic, and retainable eLearning module in Hindi and English languages, to facilitate smooth scale up, efficient implementation and uptake of HCTS. 2. EMTCT Phase -II, State assessment has been conducted in 19 States (phase II states via; Assam and Mizoram). 3. CBS of HIV has been scaled up through TI project, VHND level screening of PW and though CSO. 4. BSD-NACO has decided to make paperless register in all HCTS centers and the preparatory work has begun since August 2017. E-fountain, an IT firm has been appointed for developing the e-registers (software format of Counselling registers uses in SA-ICTC and F-ICTC) in software format. Finally, the software for registers has been developed and piloted in 10 HCTS facilities (both SA-ICTC &F-ICTC) in Delhi State. Way forward: 1. Scaling up of CBS of HIV by 100% saturation of TI Projects and VHND level HIV Screening of Pregnant women across the country. 2. All the State will be oriented on the eLearning Module by end of March, 2019, following which all SACS will ensure that all the counsellors go through the E-learning module package. 3. Implementation of risk assessment tool in ICTC for assessing the risk and vulnerability of self-initiated client to reach first 90. 4. F-ICTC has to start in different OPD of all the medical colleges, in coordination with MCI. 5. Implementation of Digitalized ICTC/PPTCT register with minimum typing content for counsellor with the support of PATH. d) HIV/TB Collaborative Activities TB disease is the commonest opportunistic infection among HIV-infected individuals. Further it is also known that, TB being a major public health problem in India accounts for 25% of deaths among PLHIV . It is known that nationally about 3% TB patients registered under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) also have HIV infection. In Manipur and Mizoram States, HIV positivity among TB patients is more than 10%. Thus, while the country is dealing 483 CHAPTER-24effectively with HIV burden, TB associated HIV epidemic is posing a great challenge. Broadly the national HIV/TB response includes activities to reduce burden of HIV among TB patients and TB among HIV infected individuals. These activities are closely guided through duly constituted National HIV-TB Coordination Committee, National Technical Working Group and State and District level Coordination Committees. The NACO and RNTCP have been successful in increasing access and uptake of HIV testing and counselling for all TB and presumptive TB patients. The objectives of the collaboration are to have close coordination between RNTCP and NACP at National, State and District levels & to decrease morbidity and mortality due to TB among persons living with HIV/AIDS. The framework adopted a four-pronged strategy a. Preventive activities focusing on IPT and infection control measures b. Early detection of TB/HIV with the use of molecular diagnostics c. Prompt treatment of TB/HIV with FDC, including test and treat policy for PLHIV d. Management of TB/HIV cases in special situations TB services are provided as a referral service to the most vulnerable populations which include FSW, MSM, TG/, IDU and Bridge Populations such as Migrants and Truckers as part of harm reduction services. During the routine outreach services, the Peer Educator and other outreach team member screen HRGs and bridge populations for TB symptoms & refer them to the nearest TB centre for confirmation and treatment. In order to promote intensified TB case finding at TIs and increasing awareness and reduce stigma for both TB & HIV , three different models are proposed based on the location, and facilities available at TI level. The models being adopted by the programme are (a) TB Screening through outreach, (b) Screening of Presumptive TB cases through RMC&C, (c) TB Screening at OST centre. Annual trend of TB-HIV burden for India (2001-2017) The co-location of Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs) and HIV testing facilities was 85% as on April 2018. The trend in the Linkage of TB HIV co- infected patients to CPT and ART is also showing healthy trend in India. 93% & 89% of co-infected patients received CPT and ART respectively during 2018-19 (till Dec, 2018) whereas 92% & 88% of TB HIV co-infected patients were linked to CPT and ART during FY 2017-18. Intensified TB Case Finding (ICF) Under ICF, all ICTC clients are screened by ICTC counsellors for presence of TB symptoms at the time of pre/post-test counselling. Clients who have symptoms or signs of TB, irrespective of their HIV status, are referred to RNTCP diagnostic and treatment facility located in nearest/co-located institution. During FY 2018-19 (Jan, 18-Mar, 2019) 7.3% (0.6% - 23.6%) of general clients (except pregnant women) receiving pre-test counselling/ information have been referred for TB testing from ICTC, and detected total 83,907 TB cases i.e. 5.3% TB cases out of referred and found 9,851 individuals co-infected with TB and HIV both at ICTC i.e. 0.6% of total referral. Patients diagnosed with TB are linked to first line anti TB drugs daily regimen for TB patients diagnosed in the respective ART centers. 93% 484 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19(8,83,456 out of 9,48,551) PLHIV attending ART centre were screened for ICF for 4 TB symptoms at ART centres and subsequently 6% (50,053 out of 8,83,456) were identified as 69% (34,732 of 50,053) were RNTCP, among whom 85% (29,620 out of 34,732) were tested for TB and 3,444 PLHIVs were diagnosed with TB i.e., 12% as per monthly ART centre report (MPR-Mar., 2019). Isoniazid (INH) Preventive Therapy (IPT): IPT is one of the strategies globally recommended for prevention of incident TB among HIV infected individuals. IPT is a key public health intervention for the prevention of TB among people living with HIV . IPT Coverage among eligible PLHIV is 43% as on March, 2019. Newer Initiatives: Launch of E-Nishchit implementation of initiative on capacity building of ART centres using ECHO Platform for HIV TB on 2nd April, 2018 at National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD), New Delhi. Country-wide coverage of policy for HIV testing among all presumptive TB cases. Expansion of TB HIV collaborative activities in private sector health facilities. Nationwide implementation of TB infection control activities at all ART centers. TB active case finding campaign among HRGs of HIV across various districts of the country. Way forward Scaling up Provider Initiated HIV testing and Counselling (PITC) across the country among Presumptive TB cases and Private sector TB patients. Strengthening IPT implementation Assessing feasibility of other innovative TB prevention therapies like 3 months of Isoniazid and Rifapentine, 4 months of Rifampicin as an alternative to 6 months Isoniazid preventive therapy with INH. Strengthening linkages of TB and HIV patients for nutritional support. 24.7 CARE, SUPPORT AND TREATMENT The Care, Support and Treatment (CST) component of the NACP aims to improve the survival and quality of life of Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) with Universal access to Comprehensive HIV care. CST services are provided through a spectrum of service delivery models including ART Centers (ARTCs), Center of Excellence (CoE), PaediatricCenters of Excellence (P-CoE), Facility Integrated ART Centers (FI-ART), Link ART Centers (LAC), Link ART Plus Centre (LAC Plus) and Care & Support Centers (CSCs) established by NACO in health facilities across the country with aim to provide universal access to free and comprehensive CST Services. There are active linkages and referral mechanism for monitoring, mentoring, decentralization and specialized care. The CST services includes free universal access to lifelong standardized ART, free lab diagnostic and monitoring services (baseline tests, CD4 testing, targeted VL), facilitating long term retention in care, prevention, diagnosis and management of opportunistic Infections and linkages to care and support services and linkage to social protection scheme.

National Technical Guidelines Standardized and uniform national technical guidelines are necessary for standardizing treatment practices and hence improving the quality of HIV care across all sectors of health care in our country context especially when many guidelines with spectrum of recommendations already exist. Based on recent developments, the guidelines for ART were revised. Major focus and inclusions in the revised guidelines are as follows: Focus on National recommendations Considering the availability of diagnostic and treatment options in the country Harmonize the treatment practices between public and private sector since there are patients seeking care from both sectors simultaneously or at different point of time Consolidate various existing guidelines and include recommendations for all age groups and populations Provide standardized guidelines for prophylaxis, prevention, screening, diagnosis and management of common opportunistic infections among PLHIV . B. Improving ART retention ART retention cascade refers to the sequential steps of patients from diagnosis of HIV to linkage with ART care, ART initiation and retention of patients who are on ART. The retention across the country has been leveraged up to 75% through CBS, prison outreach activities, differentiated service delivery Beneficiaries March-2019 PLHIV on ART 1292938 PLHIV in Preparedness Phase 31579 PLHIV on Third Line 2295 CLHIV 75521Model and Test & Treat policy. Other interventions such as, quarterly feedback and score card have also facilitated in improving retention rate. The major stages in retention cascade are as following: Diagnosis to Registration at Treatment site: ICTC to ART linkage has increased from 80% in 2013-14 to 91% in 2017-18. There are approx. 1,52,000 HIV positive cases diagnosed at ICTC. ART Initiation: The program has achieved a remarkable improvement in ART initiation rate from 61% in 2013-14 to 91% in 2018-19. There are around 1,74,667 new registrations at ART centre across the country and 1,59,208 new initiations in ART at the end of the reporting year. ART initiation 191184178170 172 174 116 12111512315015961%66% 18 2018- 19In Thousands New Registration at ART centre Initiated on ART % of initiated 12-Month Retention 116 121 2017- 18Thousand Initiated on ART Retained at 12 month % of Retention 12-month retention: The program retains 75% of PLHIV after 12 month of ART initiation which is a significant achievement towards the 90-90-90 target. CST division is closely monitoring retention cascade as quality indicator at State and facility level. Over the last three years the program has seen significant improvement in treatment retention.486 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19C. Mission \"SAMPARK\" To extend the benefit of test and treat policy and reach out to all those \"who are aware of their HIV positive status\" but \"are not on ART\" and linking them back as much as possible for HIV care, Govt. of India took the initiative in the form of \"Mission SAMPARK\", launched on 1st December, 2017. Under \"Mission SAMPARK\", it was planned to focus on three specific groups: 80 New registrations after April, 2017 Patients in pre-ART care in March, 2017 Loss to follow-up clients Two-pronged strategy was adopted for implementation of this initiative: A. Data cleaning B. Outreach Outcome: New registrations after April, 2017: Between April, 2017 to March, 2018, 1.73 lakh PLHIV were registered at ART centre out of which 1.51 (87%) have been initiated on ART. In the current financial year, since April 2018, 1.19 lakh PLHIV have been registered out of which 1.06 lakh have been already initiated ART by end of November, 2018 which is 90% of the registration. Patients in pre-ART care in March 2017 As per March 2017, 1.85 lakh PLHIV were in pre- ART care. This category was specifically focused on counselling and tracking for ART initiation. By November, 2018, it has decreased to approximately 40,000 (28000 are backlogs and 12000 are newly registered clients) patients in Pre-ART care. Out of these 1.85 lakh, 1.2 lakh (65%) already been initiated on ART. Another 28,000 are under preparedness and others 37,000 patients (20%) were lost cases. Intensified efforts are continuing to bring them back to the treatment. Loss to follow-up: During the drive, line list of more than 4.2 lakh was received and priority was given to LFU after 2010. Out of which 49,774 LFUs linked back to HIV care, 31877 LFUs reported died, 20,432 PLHIV who have been contacted but yet not linked back and are in process of counselling and 236,712 PLHIVs found as untraceable, where addresses were incorrect or where person has migrated to other place without providing next address. D. Differentiated Care The ARTC infrastructure under the NACP has expanded from 8 centres in 2004 to 544 centres in 2018. Currently, the national HIV program provides free first line, second line and third line ARVs to approx.10.3 lakhs. Programme has adopted \"Test and Treat\" policy with aim to expand access to life saving ART and achieve 90-90-90 targets by 2020. With the implementation of the policy, 3 challenges were foreseen; Overcrowding at the ART Centers Maintaining 12-month retention levels Enhancing adherence amongst On-ART patients Resolving these 3 challenges is essential to achieve the target of third 90. Decongesting ART Centers can help in improving quality of care and services offered to PLHIV . National Consultations on 'Differentiated Care' was organized with the objective of seeking inputs from technical experts, SACS, HIV community and development partners on key models and experience from implementation of differentiated models across the globe. 487 CHAPTER-24 Based on the recommendations, following differentiated care strategies have been initiated: \u00be Multi-Month Prescription (MMP): 2 months dispensation was already approved in guidelines, however due to various issues the access to it was very limited. Country has started 3-month dispensation for stable PLHIV since Sep-2018 in phased manner. In first phase it is limited to people who are on TLE. App 6 lakh PLHIV are on this regimen. \u00be Intensified Adherence Counselling: As more than 30% become MIS within first 3 months, it is important to counsel and follow-up the newly initiated patients during the first three months specially to help the PLHIV who might have developed side- effects due to initiation of ART. Under this approach, now all newly initiated clients are being actively followed up by ORW for first three months to ensure their retention and adherence during this critical period. \u00be Community Led ART Dispensation: The ART dispensation for stable clients is now also available at selected Care & Support centers managed by PLHIV network as well as NGOs running TIs for KPs. Currently app 1200 PLHIV are availing these service. E. End Mile Supply Chain Solution In order to strengthen national response to AIDS, NACO with the support of Global Fund has signed MoU with Plan India (a civil society organization) for the last mile solution for supply chain management of all ARV drugs and testing kits. The last mile solution for Supply chain mechanism for ARVs and testing kits engages third party logistics to ensure physical delivery of the commodities till last facility (ICTC/ARTC). The project envisions efficient transformation and coordination of NACO/SACS commodity supply chain, with good data visibility, in order to ensure consistent supply and continuous availability of ARV drugs and Testing Kits at ART and ICTC. 24.7.2 Feedback Mechanism The ART services have grown many folds since its launch, through 8 ART centers in 2004 to 544. These ART centers are providing free treatment to approx. 12.73 lakh People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) till date. Along with quantitative scale up, the division has been working consistently towards maintaining the 488 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19quality of services provided under the programme. To ensure this, CST division has designed a set of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools namely 1) Score Card and 2) Quarterly feedback report. a. Score Card The tool is developed with an intention to provide performance status of each ART center on pre- decided critical indicators in an individual state at a single glance to the programme managers at SACS. The performance under the indictors are denoted by colour coding wherein green color denotes good performance, yellow as in average and red denotes the performance deficit. These scorecards are being sent quarterly to all the SACS. b. Quarterly Feedback Report The report is developed by CST division to provide feedback on the position of the state's performance on the indicators critical in way to achieve the India's committed target of 90-90-90 by 2020. These reports are sent after every three months to states. As of now all the four quarter's reports have been sent. These reports have resulted in bringing remarkable improvement in ART initiation, drug adherence, retention and mortality and morbidity reduction among PLHIV in states during the year 2018. 24.7.3 Annual Review Meeting The National Review Meeting of the CST division of NACO was held from 15th to 17th January, 2019 at Bhubaneshwar, Odisha. The objective of the meeting was to review the progress made in CST programme with focus on new strategies adopted in last two years - Test & Treat policy, Mission Sampark and Differentiated Care model and to address the issues at State level. CST Division presented the progress made in CST program (2018) and plan for 2019. It included the accomplishment and learnings, challenges, limitations, determinants and road map for 2019. The data for ICTC- ART linkage, ART initiation and 12-month retention was presented. Major topics covered during the technical sessions were:489 CHAPTER-24a. National Technical Guidelines of Anti- Retroviral Therapy b. HIV/AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act c. VL Monitoring d. Differentiated ART service Delivery - SOP e. M&E Reporting Formats f. Supply Chain Management and Blended Training 24.7.4 Future Activities A. Intensified Mission SAMPARK Mission SAMPARK was launched to extend the benefit of test and treat policy and reach out to all those \"who are aware of their HIV positive status\" but \"are not on ART\" and linking them back as much as possible for HIV care, GoI took this initiative and launched on 1st December, 2017. As the Mission SAMPARK is being implemented successfully in the field, it has been further decided to conduct intensified Mission SAMPARK to clear pre-ART back-log cases across the country. Under Intensified Mission SAMPARK, latest updated MLL from all SACS were collected and segregated patients registered at ARTC and were not initiated on ART during 2015 to 2018. As a result, line list of nearly 55000 PLHIVs were prepared and shared with India HIV/AIDS Alliance for further validation and to share with CSCs for further follow up and get definite outcome. Currently the list has been shared with CSCs and follow-up with patients are on track. This initiative will leverage the expansion of Test and Treat policy which smoothens the path to achieve 90-90-90 target. B. Predictive Analysis Predictive analytics is an area of statistics that deals with extracting information from data and using it to predict trends and behaviour patterns. For patients with chronic HIV infection, the ability to remain retained in continuum of care plays a critical role in achieving good health outcomes. NACO collects vast programmatic data on treatment outcomes of PLHIV through various data sources such as Inventory Management System (IMS), patient master line list (MLL) and monthly progress reports (MPR). NACO has been using this data in descriptive data analytics to design interventions for improving patient outcomes such as retention and adherence. For instance, the retention trends from IMS data were analysed which gave an insight that ~2/3rd of patients are being lost within 3 months of ART initiation. For improving retention, NACO has developed a predictive model capable of identifying on-treatment patients that are likely to become LFU in the next 4 months using IMS data. The model demonstrated that the top 20% of its' suggested names were able to accurately identify ~70% of all LFU patients. Identifying those at risk of becoming LFU would allow the program to provide pre-emptive counselling to target patients and in potentially decreasing loss-to-follow-up among PLHIV receiving ART. If identified through such a model, these patients can be counselled during their visit, rather than following them up at a later date when they have become LFUs. C. Blended Training NACO has signed an MoU with SAATHII to strengthen the technical capacity of different cadres of ARTC/ICTC staff through Blended Clinical Trainings. One of the key activities under this project is development of a Learning Management System (LMS) which will allow different cadres to access the curriculum, contents and modules in an online mode. The initial training sessions will be conducted online which include quizzes and tests. Once the trainee qualifies the tests, he or she will be eligible for classroom/physical trainings. The LMS will also have a dashboard which will allow NACO/SACS to track progress and assess training needs of the staff. 490 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19 D. Scale Up of DSDM: Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM) has emerged as an approach for HIV programs seeking to better service delivery to the needs of people living with HIV , reduce overcrowding in the ART centers and improve client outcomes. By providing differentiated care, the health system can refocus resources to those most in need. Most current evidence focuses on multi month dispensation of ARVs to clinically stable adult clients in ART centers. The program started 3-month dispensation for stable PLHIV since Sep- 2018 and scaled it up in a phased manner. In the first phase it is limited to people who are on TLE which is approx. 6 lakh PLHIV who are on this regimen. The programme plans to leverage to other regimens also ensuring the ample stock of drugs. A client-centered approach to address the overcrowding and provide quality services to the PLHIV , the pilot adapting SALEM Model was conducted in 10 centers across the country. Based on the findings, the programme has decided to scale up across all the high load ART centers. E. Self-Verified Adherence (SV A) ( Lo:) under 99 DOTS for PLHIV on ART at the ART centers Retention in care, treatment adherence and subsequent effective VL suppression are critical measures of HIV care interventions as they positively influence the treatment and prevention benefits. While keeping the client clinically healthy, the viral suppression significantly reduces the risk of ongoing transmission of HIV (i.e. treatment as prevention). The prevention benefits of viral suppression to undetectable levels, especially among KP, is of great public health importance and contributes to cost effectiveness of the program. Since, the HIV epidemic in India is concentrated on KP, maintenance of high adherence among KP have a great impact on overall HIV response. One of the most important factors determining VL suppression in PLHIV on ART is adherence to the treatment. Achieving the clinical and prevention benefits of treatment largely depends on adherence to medication. In addition, poor adherence leads to emergence of drug resistance strains which increases morbidity and mortality among clients; and adds to the burden to the health care system (in terms of second and third line ART). Thus, adherence monitoring and supporting the client to adhere to medication is crucial to reap the benefits of ART. Currently, the mechanism of adherence monitoring includes the following: Self-reporting: Client is asked regarding his/her adherence and it is documented as reported by client. Pill counting: Client brings the remaining pills along during the visit. Counsellor counts the pills and based on this actual adherence is calculated. On time pill pick up: Adherence is calculated based on the appointment given and actual visit of client. There is a felt need to have more intensive tools for adherence monitoring to trigger early adherence support. Though the ART is a life-long therapy, it has been observed based on programme data that first 6 -12 months of ART are crucial. Maximum loss to follow up and poor pill pick up is observed in this period. Similar to TB treatment, ART also requires strict adherence for the beneficial outcomes of the treatment. The RNTCP in India is successfully implementing treatment adherence system using ICT platform with the use of tools such as 99 DOTS and Pill box and also proposes adherence monitoring strategies of automated dose reminders, 491 CHAPTER-24prompts for timely actions, etc. In this regard, NACO is also planning a pilot on Lo::(SV A: Self Verified Adherence) under 99 DOTS for PLHIV on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) at the ART centers. 24.8 LABORATORY SERVICES Laboratory Services Division functions at the cross-cutting interface of all other divisions. It is recognised that work related to laboratory services are not just confined to HIV testing, but are overarching and have an impact on other interventions including those under prevention, care, support and treatment, STI management, blood safety, procurement and supply chain management. Emphasis on quality assured laboratory service delivery is important to the success of the NACP. Universal availability and routine access to quality assured HIV related laboratory services is ensured in all service delivery points through this division. In NACP IV , laboratory services have been positioned as an independent division at the state level as well. The assurance of quality in HIV testing services through the implementation of External Quality Assessment Scheme (EQAS) for HIV and CD4 testing has been addressed in NACP with special focus. NACO launched \"National External Quality Assessment Scheme\" (NEQAS) in the year 2000 to assure the standard quality of the HIV tests being performed in the programme. EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE (EQA): The EQA was set up to ensure high reliability and validity to the HIV and CD4 tests under the programme and higher levels of proficiency in the participating laboratories. NEQAS categorized the laboratories into four tiers, as follows: Apex Laboratory (first tier) - National AIDS Research Institute, Pune. National level: 13 (NRLs) (second tier). State level: 117 State Reference Laboratories (SRLs) (third tier). Districts-level: all standalone ICTC. Thus, a complete network of laboratories has been established throughout the country. Each NRL has attached SRLs for which it has the responsibility of supervision. Each SRL, in turn, has ICTC which it monitors. One Technical Officer at each SRL is supported by funds from NACO to facilitate supervision, training and continual quality improvement in all SRLs and linked ICTCs. EQA for HIV is done in two ways: 1) Panel Testing: The participation and performance of NRL in FY' 18-19 is 100%, The % participation SRL in FY' 18-19 is 98.7% and 0.85% respectively, The participation % discordance of ICTCs in FY' 18-19 is 89.2% and 0.33% respectively, 2) Reverse Testing: In the four quarters of FY' 18-19, the average percentage of participation of ICTCs is 85.7 %, and average percentage of concordance is 99.9%.492 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19Consortium: above, NCDC Delhi; NICED Kolkata and NIMHANS Bangalore, under supervision of NARI have been identified for panel preparation and evaluation of HIV , HCV and HBV kits procured by NACO.

The strategy ensures high quality of data generation systems through surveillance, programme monitoring and research; strengthening systematic analysis, synthesis, development and dissemination of knowledge products in various forms; emphasis on knowledge translation as an important element of policy making and programme management at all levels; and establishment of robust evaluation systems for outcome as well as impact evaluation of various interventions under the programme. 24.11 MONITORING, EV ALUATION AND SURVEILLANCE Programme monitoring is vital to evidence- based national AIDS response. As country moved towards fast track targets and aims to \"End of AIDS by 2030\", the system is crucial to assess the progress towards stated targets and goals. There are various information management systems at place to manage and monitor the patient records and data. Major information systems of NACO are SIMS (Strategic Information Management System), PALS (PLHIV ART Linkage System), IMS (Inventory Management System) and Excel Based Analytical Tool for Core Group at NGO- TI level. Among all, SIMS is backbone of the programme monitoring and currently hosted on the MeghRaj Cloud of Govt. of India. The reporting is mostly 80% or more across the components. Sankalak, a bulletin of monitoring, evaluation and surveillance division, aims to report progress of national AIDS response on select key indictors including those from the 2020 fast track targets. It summarizes the data, at national and State level, on epidemic and shows progress made under prevention, detection and treatment components. Sankalak contributes to regular and systematic analysis and dissemination of the progress on critical indicators to policy-makers, programme managers and technical staff as well as to other stakeholders in the NACP. Programme monitoring reports the progress towards stated targets and goals through various mechanisms.

This is one of the largest HIV survey system across the globe providing evidences on Release of India HIV Estimation 2017 Report 510 CHAPTER-24 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19the magnitude and directions of HIV epidemic in various population groups and geographical areas and, thus, provides inputs to programme for strengthening prevention and control activities. Globally, HIV interventions at correctional institutions is strongly recommended with 'prisoners' identified as one of the groups at higher risk of HIV infection. In this view NACO has initiated HIV intervention among prison setting. In December 2017, NACO organized a national consultation to improve the ongoing prison HIV interventions. The consultation was attended by all the key stakeholders including those from Ministry of Home Affairs, Narcotics Control Bureau, World Health Organization and United Nations Office on Drug and Crime. 24.12 RESEARCH AND EV ALUATION Research & Evaluation is a vital component of SI Management. During the FY 2018-19, 12 research studies initiated in 2017-18 are ongoing to generate evidence through operational research on critical gaps in programme implementation. These areas vary from survival analysis among adult and paediatric, EID, HIV-HCV burden among transgenders, vulnerability assessment study among select female migrant populations, hard to reach MSM, changing trends in sex work dynamics and use of new technology, understanding sero-discordant settings etc. There are eight studies completed projects on priority areas identified by the programme viz., functional convergence of services among RCH and NACP for KP and for attendees at public health care facilities, biomarkers to identify immunological and virologic failure, service linkages between HIV and family planning to improve use of dual protection among HIV positive people, prevalence of WHO recommended TB Symptom Screening complex among patients attending ART centres, dose related pharmacokinetics of Rifabutin during concomitant ritonavir administration in HIV infected TB patients. The Division started a new initiative in the form of Brown Bag Seminar Series with the aim to inform as well as build capacities and knowledge of programme managers at NACO and SACS, civil society and community, academicians and scientists, development partners and other key stakeholders. The seminar series serves as a gateway for knowledge sharing, open dialogue of information, resulting into cross-learning on new developments, programme management and strengthening NACO's research agenda. The 'Brown Bag Seminar Series' has been playing a vital role, in creating a new culture of 'learning something new' and 'broadening our perspective' through sharing of knowledge and experiences over informal gatherings. Eight talks were organized during the FY 2018-19. Aligned with the mandate to build capacities in evidence generation, the Research & Evaluation Division organised a 'Capacity Building Workshop on Operational Research for Strengthening HIV/AIDS Programmatic' in collaboration with USAID and FHI 360 from 18 - 21 September, 2018 at Pune. The workshop focused on priority research areas identified for evidence generation under the national programme. Participants from TISS, NARI, NICED, PGIMER NIE, Population Council, programme managers from NACO and SACS attended the Workshop. The participants worked under the guidance of mentors, experts in the field of public health and HIV/AIDS research. During the workshop, six protocols were developed on key gaps in programme implementation - strategies to address stigma & discrimination, treatment literacy, risks and vulnerabilities among adolescents and the youth, understanding emerging epidemics. A follow-up workshop on Operational Research in HIV/AIDS was organised in October, 2018 to review the status of the studies. 511 CHAPTER-24 One Expert Committee meeting was organised this year - 18th meeting of the TRG on Research. The TRG reviewed 18 agenda items including research protocols and progress reports for technical review. Promoting Operational Research at local levels - This year, there was a consolidated effort to promote Operational Research at SACS and involving the States in programme formulation, data generation, evidence, and planning processes. Programme Managers from SACS were involved in identifying priority areas, conducting operational research studies for finding localised solutions to programmatic gaps at state and district levels.
